Manchester City's new signing Bacary Sagna has apologised to team-mate Pablo Zabaleta for ‘losing the plot’ during an angry bust-up between the two players.

Sagna was still coming to terms with the sudden death of his elder brother Omar from a seizure when he reacted furiously to a comment made by Zabaleta in a goalless draw between Arsenal and City at the Emirates in January 2011.

He twice thrust his head into the Argentine’s face and both players were sent off, although Zabaleta’s red card was later rescinded.

Head-to-head: Sagna will be hoping to dislodge fellow right-back Zabaleta at new side Manchester City

Sagna, who will compete with Zabaleta to play at right-back for City after arriving on a free transfer from Arsenal this summer, now admits he over-reacted.

‘I’ll say I was wrong,’ confessed the Frenchman. ‘It’s in the past. I made a mistake and I apologise.

‘I understand Spanish and he said something. He didn’t mean to say it to me but I took it personally – I lost the plot.

‘It was a very emotional day for me. I had just lost my brother and was not in a good frame of mind.

‘It’s one of the only times I have lost my cool, but I had just lost someone in my family. I didn’t talk to anyone and kept everything inside, so when it happened I just went crazy. I was too upset to talk to him after the game.’

Sagna saw a psychologist to address the issue and hopes to offer Zabaleta an explanation face to face.

‘Now I’m in a good place,’ he added. ‘It’s part of life and I’m okay. I did seek help when I was at Arsenal two or there times. It was good for me to talk about it.

‘I know he (Zabaleta) is a nice guy and was the first one to come over to me at training. We have not talked about it since I came here but if I get the chance one day I will explain to him.’

Even so, Sagna has no intention of playing second fiddle to fans' favourite Zabaleta after signing a three-year deal at City.

‘I know the fans love him, but this is the right challenge for me because I felt a bit in a comfort zone at Arsenal,’ he said. ‘I know I will have to fight and train really hard to get into the team.

‘The manager is going to choose the one who is in form, not the one who has just come here or who has been with the team a long time.’
