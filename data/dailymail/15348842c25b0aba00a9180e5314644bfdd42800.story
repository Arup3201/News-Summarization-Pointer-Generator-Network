Roma president James Palotta has slammed Mehdi Benatia, calling him 'poisonous' and claiming he lied to his team-mates.

The 27-year-old centre-back sealed a move to Bayern Munich in the summer, and suggested he did so because Roma needed the money.

He said: ‘I discussed my future with Roma sporting director Walter Sabatini. He told me that the club wanted to hold on to me, but that they needed the money from a sale. That annoyed me, because I initially wanted to stay put.' 

Transfer: Centre-back Mehdi Benatia moved from Roma to Bayern Munich for £20m this summer

But Palotta refuted these claims, saying: 'Mehdi Benatia has obviously continued with his pattern of outright lies over the last couple of months.

'We had a verbal agreement on compensation and a raise back in July in Boston. He personally said to me that he was happy after I told him flat out with no exceptions that we wanted him to stay.'

'Lying to me was one thing which I can somewhat handle. Lying to Rudi Garcia and his team-mates was completely unacceptable to me.

Claims: James Palotta called Benatia 'poisonous' and said he had lied to Rudi Garcia and the Roma players

'I told [sporting director] Walter Sabatini he was becoming poisonous and I wanted him gone, and Rudi and Walter agreed.

'It wasn't about the money; it was about having character in our locker room. We are in a very sound financial position.

'As owners of Roma, we make difficult decisions all the time. As a fan of Roma, I am deeply disappointed that one of our players could act this way.' 

Rumours: Benatia suggested he had been sold because Roma needed the money, something Palotta denied
