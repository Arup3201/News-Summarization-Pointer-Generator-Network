The girlfriend of a trainee firefighter who died after becoming trapped under ice in Canada has expressed disbelief at his death and says she will love him 'now and forever.'

Tragic Adam Brunt, suffered fatal injuries over the weekend while undergoing ice and water rescue training in southwestern Ontario.

The 30-year-old, who was enrolled in the firefighting program at Durham College, was dragged underwater for 15-minutes after getting caught in a strong current in the Saugeen River.

Tributes: Girlfriend, Jenna McNamee posted a photo and comments to twitter on Monday. Aspiring firefighter Adam Brunt, 30, died after becoming trapped under ice during rescue training in Ontario

His girlfriend, Jenna McNamee posted a photo and comments on twitter on Monday. 

In a series of tweets, she wrote: 'It was supposed to be just a simple ice rescue training. My heart is shattered.'

'My sweet boyfriend and soul mate. You are already so dearly missed. I love you now and forever.'

'We never in a million years expected this to happen. We are in shock. And the love of my life is gone.' 

Paramedics rushed him to hospital, where emergency workers treated him for 'several hours' before he was pronounced dead, according to police.

Authorities said the training program for ice and water rescue was provided by a private firm from Newmarket.

A statement from Durham College said: 'We are deeply saddened by this incident and will support our students, staff and faculty through this upsetting time.'

'Most students in this program choose to supplement their class instruction with practical experience, acquired from external trainers.

'We understand that Adam was participating in a training exercise that was being conducted by a private firm from Newmarket. That firm has no affiliation to Durham College.'

An investigation is being conducted by the Hanover Police Service alongside the coroner's office and investigators with the Ministry of Labour.
