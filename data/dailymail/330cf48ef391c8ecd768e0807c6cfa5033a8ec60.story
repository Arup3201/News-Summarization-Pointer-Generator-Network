Zamperini
 was the subject of Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling book 'Unbroken: A 
World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption,' which was 
being turned into a film by Jolie.

He was born in 1917 to Italian immigrants and became a world-class distance runner by the time he graduated from Torrance High School in California, setting a world interscholastic record in the mile.

July 2, 2014 Zamperini passes away in Los Angeles after a long battle with pneumonia

He won a scholarship to USC and at age 19, he qualified to compete in the 1936 Berlin Olympics.

He
 finished eighth but caught attention by running the final lap in 56 
seconds, which led Adolf Hitler to request a personal meeting with him.

In
 World War II, he was a bombardier on a U.S. Army Air Forces bomber that
 crashed in the Pacific Ocean during a reconnaissance mission.

He and the 
only other survivor among the crew survived 47 days adrift on a raft in 
shark-infested waters before being captured by Japanese forces.

He spent
 more than two years as a prisoner of war, surviving torture.

In September 1945, he returned to California to a hero's welcome.

After
 the war, in 1946, he married Cynthia Applewhite in a bar and married her in August 1946. They stayed 
married until her death in 2001 and had two children, Cissy and Luke.

He worked as a Christian inspirational speaker and preached about the power of forgiveness.

In an extraordinary show of forgiveness in 1950, he went to Sugamo Prison in Tokyo where Japanese war criminals were being held and hugged the men that had tortured him years earlier.

Universal added in its statement that 'Louis
 was truly one of a kind'.

'He lived the most remarkable life, not because
 of the many unbelievable incidents that marked his near century’s worth
 of years, but because of the spirit with which he faced every one of 
them,' it said.

'Confronting
 challenges that would cause most of us to surrender, Louie always 
persevered and always prevailed, and he spent the better part of his 
lifetime sharing the message that you could do the same.'

The
 studio said that they would push on with the release of the film 'with a
 renewed sense of responsibility in bringing Louie’s abundant life and 
indomitable spirit to the screen'.

Jolie previously told the Today show that the project gave her life new meaning.

'I've
 been sitting in my room laying there thinking, "What am I supposed to 
be doing with my life? I want do something important",' she said.

'"I
 need some help. I need some guidance. Where is it?" And it was right 
outside my window' - she said, referring to Zamperini, who was her 
neighbor in Los Angeles.

'[It's]
 such a huge responsibility to get it right. Because I love him so 
much,' she said. 'And because he's helped me so much in my life.'

Skins actor Jack O'Connell stars as Louis. Garrett Hedlund and About Time actor Domhnall Gleeson also appear in the film.

Fighting for his country: Zamperini is pictured left in March 1941 during his training with U.S. Army Air Corps and right during his induction into the Army by Maj. A. E. Merrill in September 1941 in Los Angeles

Freed: During WWII, Zamperini (third right) and Fred Garrett (left) were seized by Japanese forces and held as POWs for two years. They are pictured arriving back in California in 1945. Garrett's leg was amputated by their torturers

Love of his life: He is pictured after his wedding ceremony to Cynthia Applewhite on 20 May, 1946. They had two children, a son and a daughter, and remained married until her death in 2001

'[The world] can seem hopeless and it can seem very overwhelming,' Jolie added.  'But the resilience and the strength of the human spirit is an extraordinary thing.'

In May, Zamperini was named grand marshal of the 2015 Rose Parade in Pasadena, California.

'When the book was written the writer wanted 15 of my college buddies to interview. That scared me,' he said when the announcement was made. 'But she interviewed 15 of 'em and then she wanted to interview 16 of my war buddies that were in prison with me.

'And now after the book was finished all of my college buddies are dead, all of my war buddies are dead. It's sad to realize that you've lost all your friends. But I think I made up for it. I made a new friend - Angelina Jolie. And the gal really loves me, she hugs me and kisses me, so I can't complain.'
