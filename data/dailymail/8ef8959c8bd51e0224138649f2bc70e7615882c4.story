Witness: International Monetary Fund's Christine Lagarde has been designated as an 'assisted witness' in the French payout scandal

The head of the International Monetary Fund was tonight made an assisted witness in an alleged case of alleged embezzlement and fraud.

Christine Lagarde, 57, announced her new status following two long days of questioning by judges in Paris.

She could still face formal criminal charges over a case she described tonight as ‘complex and old’, but insisted she ‘always acted in the best interests’ of France.

The former French finance minister  has already faced calls to stand down from her £305,000  a year job.

Ms Lagarde was questioned by three judges over two whole days in the French capital over a 340 million pounds payout of public money to convicted conman Bernard Tapie.

It came after Dominque Strauss-Kahn, another senior French politician, was sacked as IMF chief following allegations that he attempted to rape a chambermaid in a New York hotel.

Ms Lagarde began campaigning to succeed Mr Strauss-Kahn soon after his arrest for the alleged crime.

But now it is Ms Lagarde, a lawyer and retired synchronised swimming star, who is facing a long court process of her own, as well as a jail sentence.

The scandal not only piles further shame on France's political class, but will worry politicians and bankers trying to resolve the global financial crisis.

Mr Tapie, the former head of adidas 
in France, claims he was cheated out of millions by Credit Lyonnais bank
when the sports kit empire was sold in 1993.

In 2007, Ms Largarde ended the epic 
dispute by ordering a panel of judges to arbitrate and, in turn, they 
awarded Tapie the damages.

Opposition MPs were furious, with 
former presidential candidate Francois Bayrou accusing Ms Lagarde of 
‘dipping into the taxpayers' pocket for a private beneficiary.’

Mr
Strauss-Kahn's Socialist Party also accused Ms Lagarde of improper 
conduct, pointing to the fact that Mr Tapie was a vocal supporter of 
Sarkozy.

Ms
Lagarde, who denies any wrongdoing, has already faced calls to resign 
from Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, France’s Minister for Women’s Rights and 
the Socialist government’s spokeswoman.

She said: ‘Knowing the IMF and the way this type of institution works, I tend to think that if she was placed under investigation, she would without doubt be asked to quit her post.’

Before tonight’s decision, Mrs Lagarde’s lawyer, Yves  Repiquet, said the inquiry was ‘in no way incompatible’ with her IMF job, adding that he expected it to be dismissed.

Tapie was jailed for six months in 1997 for corruption and match- fixing while he was the owner of  Marseilles football club.
