Love notes: Reddit user TheOnlyOne87 wrote a love note for his girlfriend every single day for a full year and filled a mason jar to the brim with the doting sweet nothings

Color coding:Pink notes detail all the reasons he loves her, yellow notes stand for memories, and green stands for song lyrics that remind him of her when he hears them

In order to best express his feelings, TheOnlyOne87 wrote three different kinds of love notes each of which are symbolized by a different color.

Pink notes detail all the reasons he loves her, yellow notes stand for memories, and green stands for song lyrics that remind him of her when he hears them.

He compiled the notes in a jar with a label that says 'contained within this 365 jar are three hundred and sixty five hand written note, each colour co-ordinated to the below themes.

Every morning for the next year you can pick one note out and it (in theory) will be a nice start to the day for you.

TheOnlyOne87 said the process was tiring for his wrist but invigorating overall.

'I designed and printed a logo for the front, but the glasswork writing on the jar protruded so far out that it was impossible to attach the printed sticker without it creasing. Still, the actual designs on the sides of the jar made up for it. The explanation was all that was needed,' said TheOnlyOne87 on Reddit as he described the design.

When TheOnlyOne87 made the final reveal to his girlfriend she cried tears of joy.

'She was... happy. She was ECSTATIC. There may have been tears - although that might have been partially to do with the amount of endless reading and unfolding she has ahead of her,' he wrote.

Exactly what's written in each note remains somewhat of a mystery but will be a very special message for TheOnlyOne87's only true love.

Keeping score: TheOnlyOne87 kept track of how many types of notes he wrote for his special someone

Process: TheOnlyOne87 set up a work station to compile his project and while his wrists got tired he contineed to feel inspired in his endeavor
