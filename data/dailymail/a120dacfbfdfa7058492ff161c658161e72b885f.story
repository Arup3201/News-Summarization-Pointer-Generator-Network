Simon Lack married Annette Hill in 2008 despite already having a wife in his home country of Canada

A wedding photographer who admitted being a bigamist has walked free from court after magistrates heard he is a regular churchgoer.

Simon Lack, 44, married Canadian wife Tanya in 2002 before tying the knot with British bride Annette Hill six years later.

Last month he pleaded guilty to bigamy at Northampton Magistrates' Court and was warned he faced a prison term when he appeared for sentencing.

The maximum sentence for bigamy is seven years in prison, but magistrates today ordered him to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and fined him a total of £145 after hearing character references from his church.

The court heard Lack married  Tanya - who was his second wife - in Canada 12 years ago before moving to the UK.

His unsuspecting wife later returned to their home country and Lack promised to follow once he had sold their possessions.

But instead of returning to North America, Lack chose to remain in Northampton and his wife was unable to afford to get back to the UK.

While he told his wife he was preparing to join her in Canada, Lack began seeing other women after joining internet dating websites.

He started seeing Ms Hill, 51, in 2006 and they married in October 2008 while he was still wed to Tanya.

Lack, who also had an ex-wife called Catherine, used his divorce papers from his first marriage to dupe Ms Hill, from Northampton, into believing his marriage to Tanya was over.

The pair wed in a lavish ceremony at the Westone Manor Hotel in Northampton, with his new bride completely oblivious to his marital status.

Lack was finally arrested after his wife, whom he left last October for another woman in Devon, became suspicious and called the police.

He told police he did not think his second marriage, in Canada, 'was real' and his defence lawyer later told the court that he believed his second wife had 'sorted' the divorce

The court heard Lack met Ms Hill over the internet after his wife returned to Canada and he showed her papers from a previous divorce to dupe her into thinking he was no longer attached

Chairman of the bench Michael Billingham said: 'We have considered what has been said on your behalf. We have read your character references, including the one from your church.

'We note you are involved with the church and you will therefore be aware that marriage is a solemn vow.

'However we are going to go with the recommendation in the report and so you will complete 150 hours of unpaid work.'

Angela Hudson, defending, said: 'Mr Lack has previous good character and he did plead guilty at the earliest opportunity, something which he should get credit for.

'He pleaded guilty because he accepts that he did not see or sign any paperwork to say that the marriage was null or void.

'There was no financial gain to marry and this was not for immigration purposes. In that regard, I think this brings down the severity of the case.'

The pair organised a lavish ceremony at Westone Manor Hotel in Northampton in October 2008

Lack later told police he did not think his second marriage, in Canada, was real and his defence team said he thought his Canadian wife had 'sorted' their divorce

She added: 'He has been extremely distressed about this, especially with the hype the case has received in the media.

'He is a gentleman who is working. He is an educated gentleman. He is a photographer. He is a member of the church. He is doing great things in the community.

'I think it is fair to say that Mr Lack realises he will be punished for this offence.

'The risk of re-offending is low and he is not a harm to the public. I would suggest that Mr Lack is not someone you will see here in court again.'

Lack, who also works as wedding photographer and part-time as a double-glazing window salesman, refused to comment on the case outside court.

Ms Hill and the couple's wedding guests were completely unaware of his marital status

The maximum sentence for bigamy is seven years but Lack was given a community sentence for his crime
