Deep in outer space, scientists have discovered a nebula that looks just like a manatee and they've decided to name it after just that.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) has dubbed a watery blue swirl of gas 18,000 light years from earth the Manatee Nebula.

In a ceremony that took place January 19 at the Florida Manatee Festival in Crystal River, Florida, the nebula officially lost its previous and much duller moniker W50 in favor of this newer, more fitting one.

According to a an NRAO statement, it was Heidi Winter, the executive assistant to the group's director, who saw a the photo of W50 and likened it to a manatee, which is often seen floating on its back, exposing its flippers.

And the name has certainly stuck.

Crystal River's National Wildlife refuge is home to the largest natural congregation of the bumbling creatures, which are also known as sea cows, in Florida.

The herbivorous manatee averages about 10 feet long and can weigh around 1000 pounds. They are most often found floating in the warm, coastal waters off the coast of the Southeastern United States.

Due to sea temperature changes, encounters with boat propellers and other factors, the gentle marine mammal is listed as an endangered species. Around 5,000 are thought to survive in the state of Florida.

The Manatee Nebula is found in the constellation of Aquila and formed about 20,000 years ago when a dying star's outer layer puffed out into a cloud of greenish-blue gas surrounding a black hole at its center.

Photos of the Manatee Nebula were taken by the Very Large Array, a grouping of 27 radio antennas situated near Socorro, New Mexico and charged with peering deep into the inky depths of space.

The Manatee Nebula joins other such animal mimicking celestial bodies as the crab, pelican, eagle, ant and owl nebulas.
