Wealthy philanthropist Carroll Petrie's estranged daughter stands to lose a share of her late mother's $100million fortune.

Petrie, the widow of investor and retailer Milton Petrie, passed away January 22 at age 90.

The affluent Manhattan socialite was best known for her charitable endeavors, including the Carroll Petrie Foundation Dog Rescue Project run by the ASPCA, which had been one of Petrie's beneficiary. 

Petrie was passionate about animals and even made headlines when she donated $100,000 to the president of ASPCA asking to rescue a dog she had seen stranded on a house roof during Hurricane Katrina.

According to her will, Petrie had set aside $12.5million for her only daughter Andrea Portago, a former model-turned-photographer, but in the document she left a cryptic message that read, 'I have not obtained a valid court-issued order of protection against Andrea after the date of this will and before the date of my death,' reported New York Post's Page Six.

Andrea, a former fashion model and daughter of Carroll Petrie's first husband, Spanish aristocrat and playboy race car driver Alfonso de Portago, had a strained relationship with her mother.

It has been reported that the two woman had not seen each other for five years leading up to Carroll Petrie's death.

Miss Portago, 64, has already retained the services of the high-powered Manhattan trust and estates attorney Harvey E. Corn, who has confirmed the mother and daughter's estrangement.

The lawyer told the Post that Miss Portago allegedly had tried to see her mother before her death but was prevented from doing so.

There is no word at this time if Miss Portago will challenge her mother's will, but her attorney said they have requested earlier versions of the document.

It is expected that a large portion of the glamorous socialite's fortune will go towards her foundation.

Under Ms Petrie's will, each of her two granddaughters will receive $12.5mllion, and a million will go to New York-Presbyterian Hospital, where the late philanthropist had been a board member.

Born to a Christian Baptist family in South Carolina, Carroll McDaniel attended Converse College and enjoyed a brief career in modelling before marrying Andrea Portago's glamorous father, Don Alfonso Cabeza de Vaca y Leighton, 17th Marquis de Portago.

The two lived in Paris until Alfonso de Portago's death in a fiery car wreck in 1957. He was 28 years old.

Two failed marriages later, Carroll said 'I do' to multimillionaire Milton Petrie - himself a three-time divorcee - in 1978.

Over the course of their 17-year union, the prosperous and generous power couple gave away hundreds of millions of dollars to charitable organizations, hospitals and cultural institutions, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which named a European sculpture court after the Petries in 1990.

Mrs Petrie also sat on boards of the Gracie Mansion and the Central Park conservancies, and was a life trustee of the New York-Presbyterian Hospital.

‘She went everywhere. She was a great beauty and extremely elegant. She had a very, very Southern accent. She had many friends. She had a good sense of humor. She was a social hostess and gave many parties. It was fun to be there,’ Aileen Mehle, a long-time gossip columnist better known by her nome de plume, Suzy, said of her late friend in an interview with Women's Wear Daily.

On bad terms: Portago, the daughter of Petrie and her first husband (pictured here with Kris Kristofferson at the premiere of Heaven's Gate in 1980), and her philanthropist mother had not spoken for five years

Mrs Petrie also held honorary doctorate degrees from New York Institute of Technology and Long Island University.

In 1987, the King of Spain bestowed the philanthropist with the highest honor awarded to foreigners, the Medal of Honor of the Order of Isabel La Catolica.

The New York Times reported that when Carroll Petrie’s husband Milton died in 1994 at age 92, he left her a $150million trust fund, ‘$5million in cash, two homes, including a Fifth Avenue apartment, planes, cars, jewels, art and antiques.’

Andrea Portago, the only surviving child of Carroll Petrie and her first husband, by all accounts has had a turbulent and fascinating life.

In a 1977 profile published by People Magazine, then-26-year-old model talked about her privileged childhood, which she compared to that of the fictional character Eloise: wild rides with her playboy dad in his Ferrari around Paris; acting lessons at age 10; dance classes with legendary choreographer George Balanchine, and being bounced around a half-dozen boarding schools.

The year the profile came out, the striking brunette graced the June cover of her friend Andy Warhol’s Interview magazine.

'She's going to be a very big star,' the pop art visionary said at the time of his muse.
