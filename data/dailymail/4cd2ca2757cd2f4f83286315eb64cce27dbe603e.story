When Tony Blair and Gordon Brown wanted to show us how ‘well’ they were getting on in 2005, Mr Blair gave Mr Brown an ice-cream cone.

Yesterday, in the market square of charming Newark, Nottinghamshire, David Cameron bought a slice of Rocky Road biscuit cake and broke off a chunk for Boris Johnson.

‘Go on, Boris, you know you want some.’ Mayor Johnson: ‘Err, well, hmmmn.’

It looked a bit on the dry side. Boris inspected it as a small child may examine a broccoli floret which has been placed on his plate with the words ‘eat your greens’.

David Cameron and Boris Johnson swapped banter about baking as they toured stalls in Newark

The sight of Mr Cameron paying for cakes for his leadership rival drew parallels with the infamous moment Tony Blair bought ice-creams for Gordon Brown before the 2005 general election

Mr Blair's moment of generosity was supposed to end speculation about tensions between the two Labour figures, but he came under intense pressure to name a date for handing over power to Mr Brown

Mr Johnson and Mr Cameron spent several hours together, sharing a joke over a coffee at Newark train station

Travelling back into London on the tube, the Prime Minister caught up on the news while Mr Johnson chatted with aides

Perhaps Boris is on a diet. No way did he want to eat that lump of calories.

Sleek Mr Cameron merrily popped it in his mouth and chewed. And chewed. And chewed. Picture framer Steve Buxton, 50, started quizzing him about VAT rates. Mr Cameron had to answer through a mouthful of crumbs.

The two Tories had descended on unsuspecting Newark for little more than ten minutes of frenetic handshaking, leaflet-dispensing, smalltalk and ‘selfies’ with voters. It being a Wednesday morning, most of them were pensioners or parents of toddlers.

The resignation of Newark’s Tory MP Patrick Mercer after a lobbying scandal has caused a by-election on June 5. In first-term Blairism this was a Labour seat but the main threat to the Tories’ 16,152 majority now comes from Ukip.

The purple brigade have chosen for their candidate one Roger Helmer, a septuagenarian former Tory whose views about homosexuality (he is not a fan) have caused a minor to-do. Mr Helmer was yesterday in a coffee shop on the square. Hiding.

Mr Cameron indulged in the political tradition of posing with babies while on the campaign trail

Securing victory in Newark will be key to the Tory plan to prove it can see off the threat from Ukip

During a walkabout, Mr Cameron was confronted about government policy on the NHS, crime and schools

Mr Cameron insisted that the government was putting more money into key public services

Between Boris and Dave waddled their party’s candidate, Robert Jenrick, 32, a blinky, prosperous-looking fellow who works for Christie’s auction house.

Ladies and Gentlemen, what are we bid for this rare lot, a sighting of the PM alongside Boris, the man who allegedly pants and champs for his job?

They arrived via an alley, Boris the shorter and porkier. Mr Cameron glistened with health and was wearing a sun tan. Has he lost weight? What an essay in oneupmanship he is.

Around voters he becomes incorrigible, all laughter lines and smoky voice saying ‘well, nice to see you’ and ‘what’s your plan for the day?’, like  Leslie Phillips. ‘Enjoy the sunshine. Ding dong.’ Boris was more staccato, barking ‘vote on June 5th’ and ‘oi - have a leaflet!’

Voters, confronted by Cameron, gawp. When they see Boris they find themselves consumed by merriment. I checked.

Yes, his flies were done up. Occasionally Boris strayed from the PM’s orbit but he took care not to lag too far behind, even when detained by women (they flutter to him as bluebottles to an old kipper).

Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson are expected to be seen together a lot more in the run-up to the 2015 general election

The PM has described the London Mayor as one of his 'star players' who he wants to see on the national pitch

One told him huskily, ‘you’re the only one who speaks sense’. Boris shot her a longing double-take but then raced off to catch up with Dave, who was chatting up new mum Christina Riley and her baby Jonah, nine and a half months. Jonah dribbled in a thoughtful sort of way.

A fruit stall. Fruits? Ukip’s Helmer wouldn’t like that! Melons and cherries. Oh Boris. Mr Cameron hankered to buy some strawberries but the stallholder was busy and the PM could not wait so his £10 note stayed in his hand.

An old biddy with a shopping trolley appeared. ‘Good morning!’ cried Mr Cameron.

The old girl, like something out of the Dick Emery show, did not even raise her head. She just ploughed on past, intent on reaching a stall selling pansies.

A seed stall was advertising hamster food and dog treats. Would Dave buy the faithful Boris some large fat balls (one quid each)? No. But he did pat Boris’s hair when a voter remarked on it. ‘He’s had a hair cut and is looking very good,’ said Mr Cameron. Boris blushed.

Only when the PM and mayor had vanished did Mr Helmer appear. It seemed rather unlike Ukip to shy away from a confrontation.

The Tories are throwing some effort into Newark. At the railway station I bumped into Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Chief Whip Sir George Young, Bt. Sir George was in civvies, including a wonderfully battered gardening hat.
