A company boss raped a woman in a five-star hotel suite's bathroom after plying her with drinks at a top London nightclub, a court heard.

Mohammed Aneizi, 26, allegedly attacked the woman in a suite of the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington, west London, after meeting her at celebrity haunt Movida in nearby Mayfair.

He denied rape, telling a jury today: 'She kept saying she wanted to go home with me'.

CCTV footage showed him buying the woman drinks and swigging from a champagne bottle at the nightclub, where guests have included Kate Moss, Kim Kardashian and Coldplay singer Chris Martin.

Isleworth Crown Court, west London, heard the drunk woman then returned with him and his friend Gurkhan Suleyman to a suite at the five-star hotel.

There Aneizi is accused of raping her twice in the bathroom before leaving her for an hour without checking on her. Suleyman, 28, is also accused of attempted rape.

The former director of mail-order cosmetics firm Verity Skincare took the stand today in his defence, saying the woman had insisted on coming home with him.

He was shown the footage of himself buying the woman drinks in the early hours of May 24 last year.

The footage showed him swigging champagne from the bottle and kissing the woman, then lying on a couch together before a friend of the woman tried to lift her up and encourage her to leave.

Prosecutor Mark Seymour told Aneizi: ‘The problem here is that she [the victim] is completely drunk'.

Aneizi, wearing a smart navy suit, replied: ‘Yes, she is very drunk and looks quite tired.

‘At this point she expressed feelings to her friend that she did not want to go home with her, but with me.

‘Her friend wasn’t very happy about this decision, and tried forcing her to go home against her will.

‘She kept saying she wanted to go home with me.

‘When she did decide to leave she got up unaided - so she can’t have been too drunk.

‘I told her friend that I would take care of her but she was not in agreement, and then the two girls had an argument.’ 

Aneizi and Suleyman then returned with the woman to the Royal Garden Hotel where the alleged attack took place in the suite’s bathroom while friends socialised in the lounge.

Aneizi joined his friends at 4.15am but the woman remained in the bathroom for more than an hour.

He told jurors he thought she was freshening up, but heard a loud commotion outside the bathroom an hour later and rushed to help.

On finding her in the foetal position, Aneizi said he noticed £20 notes strewn over the floor.

Mr Seymour told him: ‘During the course of the evening there had been quite a considerable amount of interest from your group about what you were doing... videos and photographs.

‘You knew this lady wasn’t in a perfect condition, because she had slept all the way in the back of the car to the hotel. She was out of it.

‘You made a point in your police interview that she had been following you around, as if she didn’t want to be left alone.

‘You even go so far to say that she was stuck to you like glue.

‘You have just had sex in the bathroom, and you leave her freshening up and expect to see her quite soon after this point.

‘But you leave her in the bathroom for a whole hour.

‘During that time you make no effort whatsoever to check up on her, despite the state she was in.’ 

Aneizi, of Ealing, west London, maintained that the woman consented to sex throughout.

Aneizi denies two counts of rape and Suleyman, of Beaminster, Dorset, denies one count of attempted rape.

The trial continues.
