A young Briton is seriously injured after plunging 70 feet from a hotel balcony in Majorca.

Sean Kelly, 24, was reported to be climbing from one balcony to another on the seventh floor of the building in the brash resort of Magaluf.

It was the first case of its type this year involving a Briton on the holiday island.

Mr Kelly was later said to be 'serious but stable' in Majorca's main Son Espases hospital.

A senior officer from the paramilitary Civil Guard said: 'It seems that this person was climbing from balcony to balcony when he fell. It was about three o'clock in the morning.'

Every year several young British holidaymakers, usually while drunk or high on drugs, are killed or gravely injured in what locals have dubbed balconing - climbing or swinging from one terrace to another, or even purposely leaping from balconies in attempts to land in swimming pools. .

Two others were also killed elsewhere in Spain's Mediterranean islands, while ten others have been seriously injured, according to figures.

Last year the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and ABTA (The Travel Association) have teamed up in an attempt to get holidaymakers to think twice before they engage in risky behaviours while abroad.
