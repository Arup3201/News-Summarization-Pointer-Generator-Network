Daniel Spargo-Mabbs died from a heart attack after taking ecstasy at a rave

A boy of 16 died after making a ‘fatal’ decision to buy ecstasy to take with friends at an illegal rave, a court heard yesterday.

Daniel Spargo-Mabbs collapsed after downing a bottle of water laced with half a gram of the Class A drug.

Ryan Kirk, 21, is accused of delivering the drugs, known as MDMA, to Daniel’s friends before the party in a disused cotton factory in Hayes, West London, in January.

Prosecutor Tyrone Silcott told Isleworth Crown Court that the five friends, aged 15 to 17, made a ‘bad’ decision to get some ecstasy.

He said that Kirk, of Beckenham, South East London, took £80 in cash from the boys and in return handed over three bags, covered in blue stars, containing 2.5 grams of white powder.

It is alleged that Kirk was a ‘deliveryman’ for drug dealer Nicqueel Pitrora, 18, from Croydon, who has pleaded guilty to two counts of supplying drugs.

One of Daniel’s friends said that unlike the rest of them who sipped their ecstasy-laced water, he downed his 500ml bottle instantly.

Daniel, from Croydon, South East London, who attended Archbishop Tenison’s Church of England School, died from a suspected drugs overdose two days later following multiple heart attacks.

The defence say Kirk’s case is one of mistaken identity as he was picked out at an identity parade by one of Daniel’s friends who has admitted to not being ‘certain’.

Yesterday, the friend said he was ‘80 per cent sure’ Kirk was the one who delivered the drugs.

When Kirk was arrested, police allegedly found, in a bedroom he shared with his younger brother, 127.8g of cannabis, a large quantity of snap bags and electronic scales, two mobile phones and £185 in cash.

Kirk denies two charges of being concerned with the  supply of Class A drugs and  one of Class B.

Tyrone Silcott, prosecuting, told the court: 'Back on the 17th of January of this year a group of young men aged between 15 and 17 were going out for an evening to a party sometimes known as a rave at a venue in Hayes.

'The group of young men made a bad decision that evening.

He told the jury that the group - some
 of whom cannot be named for legal reasons -  had arranged to get drugs,
 adding: 'One of those young men died as a result of taking ecstasy.'

The
 court heard 'three bags of white powder' were delivered before the 
rave. The jury was told Daniel paid £20 towards a quantity of MDMA and 
put what was thought to be half a gram of the drug into 500mls of water 
in a bottle - with one witness claiming he possibly drank it all in one 
go.

The court heard Daniel took off his shirt after taking the drugs and was 'talking a lot more than he usually does', including talking about his girlfriend

Mr Silcott told the jury
 that 'despite the tragic backdrop' of the case, their focus should be 
on whether or not Kirk was the person who delivered the drugs on January
 17.

The jury was told that 
another man, Nicqueel Pitrora, 18, from Croydon, pleaded guilty at the 
same court of being concerned in supplying a controlled drug of class A 
on January 17.

Mr Silcott said it was Pitrora who was telephoned and asked if he could supply two and a half grams of MDMA.

The group was quoted a price of £80, the court heard.

Mr
 Silcott said witnesses described the person who delivered the drugs as 
being a white man with pale skin and of skinny build. 'The prosecution 
say it was Ryan Kirk,' Mr Silcott said.

The jury was shown footage of the identity parade seen by Daniel's friend and when the identity officer asked if the witness has made a positive identification, he says: 'Yes. Do I have to be certain? If I have to be certain, then no.'

The court heard that Kirk claims to 
have been at his friend’s house playing X Box on the night he is accused
 of delivering the drugs. 'He said he does not attend raves and has 
never been to Hayes,' Mr Silcott said.

Later the schoolboy who arranged the deadly deal told jurors he was only '80 percent' sure the dealer was Kirk.

Speaking
 from behind screens to protect his identity, he explained the man on 
the bike had stopped for only 10 or 20 seconds when passing the boys the
 illegal drugs.

He had rung a contact called 'Shampz' three times on the 17 January to arrange the £80 deal.

Mr
 Silcott asked: 'You have told us that the boy that you think you 
identified had sold you drugs before? ' Yes,' came the reply.

Ryan Kirk, 21, from Beckenham, South London, is on trial charged with being concerned in supplying a controlled drug of class A - MDMA to Daniel (pictured). He denies the charges

'And that you think he is someone who had given you MDMA before and cannabis I think you said? 'Yeah,' he said.

'Do you remember now if they got off the bike?

'No I think they just rode up on the bike and took it.

'You told us when you were being asked questions about it that you were 80 percent sure, is that still right?

'Yes'. But defence counsel Roderick Jones dismissed the meeting as 'minimum contact, minimum observation'.

The jury was shown a video of Kirk's police interview which took place on January 21 at Croydon Police Station. He repeatedly denied any involvement in the supply of drugs, saying he has 'never' been involved in MDMA.

Kirk told police he had taken MDMA once, adding: 'I didn't like it.'

In the video, Kirk was questioned about cannabis and electric scales found in his bedroom. He said he shares his bedroom, which he said has two televisions, with his 18-year-old brother.

Kirk said in the interview the cannabis was 'nothing to do with me'.

Asked if he had any addictions, Kirk said: 'Caffeine. That's about it.'

He said that on the day he is accused of delivering the drugs he went to the shop to get cigarettes and dog food for his mother.

In the video, Kirk said he receives job seeker's allowance of £100 a week and said he had been applying for lots of jobs.

He denied being involved in gangs, and said. 'I finished college and have been working with my dad until May this year.

'I don't want to work on a building site so have been interviewing for an apprenticeship in business admin.'

The
 court heard Daniel took off his shirt after taking the drugs and was 
'talking a lot more than he usually does', including talking about his 
girlfriend.

Mr Silcott said a toxicology report found that after the incident Daniel had MDMA in his blood.

The trial will resume at 10.15am on Wednesday.
