The Australian radio DJ who made the prank call to the London hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated during her pregnancy has admitted she 'should have tried harder' to stop the call going to air.

The hoax by Mel Greig and her colleague Michael Christian in December 2012 was linked to the death of British nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who blamed them in her suicide note.

Ms Greig's mother has since received death threats, while the 2DayFM presenter has battled depression.

'I felt like a failure as a human being,' Ms Greig said in a tearful interview with Channel Seven's Sunday Night.

'I am ashamed of myself. I should have tried harder to not let that prank call air.'

The truth: Mel Greig has given her side of the Royal prank call story during a tearful interview on Channel Seven's Sunday Night

Upset: 'I felt like a failure as a human being,' Ms Greig said, as she described the moment she found out British nurse Jacintha Saldanha (right) had died

The presenters were pretending be the Queen and Prince Charles during the call, when they found out the sensitive news that Kate was being treated for acute morning sickness.

Ms Greig has now revealed how she urged senior managers at 2DayFM to alter the recording but they ignored her.

She asked her bosses to use radio staff members' voices instead of the actual voice of nurse Jacintha Saldanha.

The nurse at King Edward VII Hospital - who transferred Ms Greig's call to the Duchess's ward - was found hanged three days after the prank, on 7 December.

Just before she took her own life Mrs Saldanha wrote three notes; in one she held the Australian presenters responsible for her death.

Information about how Ms Greig tried to stop Mrs Saldanha’s voice being used has only emerged now, as she was previously legally gagged from revealing details about the day.

'I want to answer everything so hopefully everyone can move forward,’ Ms Greig said in September, when the first part of the Channel Seven interview was recorded.

'I think of the Saldanha family all the time, I just want them to see that I’m sorry.’

In a statement from the Southern Cross Austereo radio company in December 2013, the station said the dispute arising from the royal hoax had been 'amicably resolved' and Ms Greig had resigned, effective from December 31.

The company reiterated its position that recording and broadcasting the fateful call was 'not unlawful' and said 2Day FM decided to broadcast the call despite suggestions from Ms Greig that it should be changed.

In a statement, Austero said: 'Prior to the call being broadcast she made suggestions for changes to be made to the recording of the call.

'2Day FM decided that the call should be broadcast without alteration.'

The stunt drew widespread criticism around the world. The hospital's boss John Lofthouse said: 'This was a foolish prank call that we all deplore.'

Ms Greig started crying just seconds into the interview and revealed how she has suffered from depression since the incident

On Sunday night, Ms Greig also told how she’d had lost her career and health and how she and her family has had to endure constant attacks.

People who blamed her for Mrs Saldanha’s death went on to threaten her mother.

Less than 18 months after Jacintha Saldanha tragically killed herself in the wake of the Royal DJ prank fiasco, her son Junal Barboza was named student of the year at his sixth form college.

The 17-year-old, who uses his father's surname, picked up the gong from St Brendan's Sixth Form College in Bristol.

'I was shocked and honoured. I wouldn't say I was a model student. I just get on with things on a daily basis and don't do anything too outrageous,' he said at the time. 

'I came back as early as I could because if I had stayed at home I would have been thinking in a negative state.'

He was praised for his determination, strength of character and resilience when he was crowned the college's student of the year.

'They would call my mum and say “an eye for an eye - she died… and now you have to die”.’

Ms Greig started crying just seconds into the interview and revealed how she has suffered from depression since the incident.

'I don't feel like myself any more. For nine months I feel like I've been living a stranger's life… You're meeting a Mel that has no confidence, a Mel that is so lost in her life.’

She said she has 'so much shame and so much guilt’.

The radio presenter refused to listen to the prank call again, the first time interviewer Mel Doyle asked if she could play it.

‘I don’t want to ever listen to it again… I’m ashamed of myself,’ she explained.

‘I should have tried harder not to have that prank call air, it never should have aired. We were never meant to get anywhere near Kate, it was meant to be something silly.’

Ms Greig - who recently became engaged to her boyfriend Stephen (right) - remains unemployed, having even been turned down by community radio stations

Ms Greig was at home with her boyfriend Stephen when she found out about the nurse’s death.

‘I felt like the worst person alive and that feeling hasn’t really gone away,’ she cried.

In a follow-up interview with Ms Greig, in part of the Sunday Night show, she agrees to listen to the two minute, 11 seconds recording of the prank call.

‘I feel disgusted in myself listening back to it,’ she cried.

Despite the decision to broadcast the hoax being down to the bosses at the radio station, Ms Greig’s lawyer claims she remains the ‘fall guy’.

An inquest into Mrs Saldanha’s death is still waiting to be heard. It has now been postponed three times.

Meanwhile, Ms Greig - who recently became engaged to her boyfriend Stephen - remains unemployed, having even been turned down for jobs by community radio stations.

‘I wish I could go back to that day and have called in sick,’ she said.

After the TV interview aired on Sunday, Ms Greig wrote on Twitter: 'Thank you to @sundaynighton7 and @melissadoyle for sharing my story tonight and thank you for the support x'
