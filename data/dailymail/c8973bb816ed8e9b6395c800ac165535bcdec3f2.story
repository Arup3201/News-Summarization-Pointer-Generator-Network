Nathan Cleverly has vowed to step up his quest to become a two-weight world champion by disposing of Tony Bellew in their rematch in Liverpool on November 22.

The Welshman beat Bellew via majority decision in the same city in October 2011 but went on to lose his WBO light-heavyweight title in a knockout defeat to Sergey Kovalev last year.

Bellew also suffered a jolting loss at the hands of Adonis Stevenson in Quebec last November but the pair now campaign at cruiserweight where they hope to muscle back in on the title picture.

Cleverly said: 'Many people have asked me why I am going back to Liverpool to fight Tony Bellew again and the answer is simple - I don't like him.

'He talks too much and although I've beaten him before in front of his home fans, I am going to KO him this time around. He will not hear the final bell, I can guarantee you that.

'I will deal with him all over again and become a two-weight world champion.'

Since his loss to Stevenson, Bellew has bounced back with two low-key stoppage wins over Valery Brudov in March and Julio Cesar Dos Santos in July.

The two boxers fought previously with Cleverly winning on points, Bellew said revenge was motivating him

There is clearly bad blood between the pair and Bellew insists he will claim a victory comprehensive enough to send Cleverly into retirement.

Bellew said: 'I have been waiting for this fight for three years and now it is here revenge is the only thing on my mind.

'This is a chapter in my life that I need to close and I will do that by ending Nathan Cleverly's career on November 22.

'I am in the sport to be successful and win titles but this fight means more to me than any of that - this is personal, and he will not want to enter a boxing ring after I have finished with him.'

When asked why he was going back to fight Bellew Cleverly said: 'the answer is simple - I don't like him'
