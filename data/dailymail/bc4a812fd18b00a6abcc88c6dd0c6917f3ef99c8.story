If a male-only social network was launched that let men rate their former conquests in terms of attractiveness and sexual ability, it probably wouldn't go down very well.

But somehow, a female-only equivalent is OK.

Luluvise.com, which went live yesterday, is a social network, described as 'Sex And The City marries Facebook' - and it bans boys.

Latest internet craze? Entrepreneur Alexandra Chong has set up Luluvise.com, a social network that is just for women

It connects through your Facebook 
profile - although does not let any of your Facebook friends know that you have connected.

'Luluvise uses Facebook to make registration easier. We do not post to walls or make Luluvise information public anywhere or to other Facebook users,' creator Alexandra Chong explained.

Once you've logged on you can see what other women have 
said about your potential love interests.

The site does serve other functions too - you can use it to send messages, photos or polls to groups of female BFFs ('Best Friends Forever'). But that is only likely to take off if people flock to the 'WikiDate Database'.

Harsh? Luluvise lets you describe your first kiss with a former squeeze as 'slobber city' - or amazing

This is internet dating 2.0 - in that the first men that pop up are the ones who are already your friends on Facebook. But they will never know that you have rated them, and neither will anyone else.

Some of the ratings do seem a little harsh. Particularly the ones that invite you to rate your first kiss as 'slobber city', or to summarise your sex life as 'All I could could think was..."Is he into girls?".'

But getting an insight into your male friends' romantic lives - even if you have no interest in bagging them at all - is bound to be popular.

Not fair? Men cannot even see their ratings - unless they create a fake facebook profile in which they pretend to be a woman

The website, set up by Canadian entrepreneur Alexandra Chong, 30, in London, is already all over twitter.

Cosmopolitan UK tweeted: 'If Carrie Bradshaw had signed up to #Luluvise, it would've saved her a LOT of heartache!'

Men are unsurprisingly hankering to join.

More than 500 boys have already submitted their 
emails to get access to the site, but instead received an email reading: 'Hey Dude, you're a dude.'

Circle of friends: The site also lets you set up a network of 'BFFs' who you can collectively ask questions, send messages and send photos

It is possible for men to get around the ban and see what women are saying about them - with a little dedication. They need to set up a fake Facebook profile as a woman, and make friends with themselves on that social network.

Then, when they log onto Luluvise, their own ratings will pop straight up. But they will not be able to see private conversations.

However, Luluvise has set up a series of strict rules in the backend technology that should prevent any fake Facebook accounts from accessing the site.

The site's first 1,000 legitimate users came from across the globe, with 69 countries represented on the platform.

The majority were split across the US, UK and Canada.
