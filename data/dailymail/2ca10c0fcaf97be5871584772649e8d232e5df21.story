Manny Pacquiao used to come to Macau often.

Not to fight but to play the tables in the casinos which rake in more revenue than their namesakes in Las Vegas.

That was before he found politics, basketball and, most importantly, God.

Manny Pacquiao and Chris Algieri gear up for battle in Macau in front of the glare of the world's media

Pacquiao looked in relaxed mood ahead of his 63rd fight, while Algieri looks on

Pacquiao said he is fully focused on beating his American opponent on Saturday

The only boxer ever to win world titles in eight weight divisions recalls: ‘Back when I loved to gamble I was here a lot.’

This week the PacMan is here to fight Chris Algieri.

The American matinee idol is five years younger, five inches taller, undefeated and a world light-welter champion in his own right.

Not only is Pacquiao’s world welterweight title at stake in this catch-weight contest but the hope of tempting Floyd Mayweather into a potential billion dollar fight next year.

The 35-year-old Filipino revealed he felt as fit as he did in the early stages of his career

So could this be a bigger gamble than any wager he laid in his partly miss-spent youth?

Not really, it seems.

Pacquiao never prepared for those 90 minute trips from Manilla. He just came to have fun.

This time he has done the road work, the thousand sit-ups a day, the hundreds of rounds of sparring against up-and-coming title contenders and he says: ‘There is no pressure because of what could happen with Floyd. I am fully focussed on Algieri. I will be completely in the zone when we are in the ring.

‘I’m back to how I felt a few years ago. Fit, fast, strong. I’m not taking Chris lightly. I’m not looking past him. Only God predict what will happen but I am confident in myself.’

Born a Catholic, Pacquiao turned back to religion when his wild lifestyle jeopardised his family life with his wife and five children.

He has never shied away from the topic and says: ‘I’m a friendly personality and always been very open about my life. I like to be among friends and to share the word of God with people.’

With his redemption secure, he feels the power returning to his fists, adding: ‘I have worked to bring back the early days, those when I was at my best and finished fights early.’

At 35, he says he feels 26 again.

There was talk of distraction when, as a Philippines congressman, he announced his intention to run for his country’s senate. Then, as a 5ft 5in boxer, he took over a basketball team and became not only the shortest but the oldest rookie to take to the professional court.

The light welterweight champion recently took time off from training to play in his first basketball game 

But trainer Freddie Roach affirms: ‘We negotiated an agreement. I know Manny needs to be busy in many areas so we gave him a pass for one basketball game and then he commited to training for this fight the way he used to in what people regard as his prime. Now he’s as ready as he’s ever been.’

If they are right, this is bad news for Algieri.

Not that he appears unnerved. He displays not an ounce of doubt that he can pull off one of the prize-ring’s major upsets.

Nor, perhaps, should he after winning his title by climbing off the canvas twice in the first round against renowned puncher Ruslan Provodnikov to claim a hard-fought 12-round decision.

Pacquiao is the only boxer in history to be a world champion in eight different weight divisions

Algieri is a likeable, persuasive talker who says: ‘Manny is one of the greats but I have the skills to defeat him.’

This will be only the 21st fight for a 30-year-old of Argentine-Italian extract who still lives in the basement of his parents’ house in Long Island, New York, and plans to continue qualifying to become a doctor when he finishes with the fisticuffs.

At which, the PacMan smiles

In that unassuming way of his. Kindly, but convinced he holds all the chips.

And utterly impervious to the temptations of the vast gaming floor at the Venetian Hotel.

Place your bets.

Pacquiao v Algieri will be televised live in Britain on BoxNation late Saturday night.
