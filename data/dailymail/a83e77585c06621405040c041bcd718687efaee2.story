Kevin Green, who pleaded guilty to stealing diesel from Andrew Woodhouse's tyre yard, claims he is the victim after Mr Woodhouse was cleared of assaulting him

A thief has criticised the justice system for 'letting him down' after the victim who battered him was cleared of assault.

Unemployed Kevin Green, 53, suffered two broken legs and a broken arm when landscape gardener Andrew Woodhouse attacked him and his son-in-law as they fled his business premises.

Green and Tim Cross, 32, had stolen diesel from Mr Woodhouse's tyre yard, prompting the father-of-five to chase the pair and perform a citizen's arrest.

But Green told Emma Foster at The Sun he is the 'real' victim, adding that no one understands the pain and suffering he has been subjected to.

He said he is plagued by nightmares over the incident and is now unable to go fishing or walk his dogs after his injuries rendered him housebound.

'He went at me like a madman hitting me with a stick - all over 50 quid's worth of diesel,' he said.

'I'm the victim in all this. I don't think he realises what suffering I had to go through, which is ten times more than him.'

Mr Woodhouse, 44, has been battling a spate
 of crime at his company - and sprang into action when his alarm rang 
after midnight as the thieves were stealing diesel.

Mr Woodhouse grabbed a fence post one was carrying as a weapon - and used it to fight back against them.

He was shocked to be charged with using 
excessive force in his citizen's arrest - and hauled to court four times
 before being cleared by a 12-strong jury at Cardiff Crown Court last week.

Mr Woodhouse runs a machinery and tyre depot two miles from his home near 
Abergavenny, South Wales, which have been plagued by criminals.

Mr Woodhouse was cleared of two counts of grievous bodily harm by a jury at Cardiff Crown Court. He was alerted by an alarm at his business premises in Llanfoist in South Wales last March

He said he has repeatedly been a victim of crime at his 
gardening company costing him £30,000 over the past five years.

Mr Woodhouse
 was woken in the middle of the night by a text message telling him a 
burglar alarm had gone off at the tyre yard where he runs his business.

Mr Woodhouse was in bed with his wife Lisa at their detached home in the village ofGovilon, near Abergavenny, when his burglar alarm went off at about 12.30am.

Green and his son-in-law Timothy Cross, pictured, were fined £75 by magistrates

The alarm is fitted to his business premises on an industrial estate a mile from his six-bedroom £350,000 home.

Mr Woodhouse drove to the premises where he disturbed two men stealing stealing diesel from his machinery.

The court heard officers found Green lying injured under a blanket - and Cross claiming the businessmen had gone 'over the top'.

He proclaimed he was fully justified in keeping hold of the two burglars until police arrived.

The
 thieves ended up with £75 fines - but businessman Woodhouse could have 
faced a sentence of life imprisonment if he had been found guilty.

Green and Cross tried to escape into a neighbouring field with jerry cans full of stolen fuel.

But
Mr  Woodhouse chased Green - and caught him near their getaway car. He then
 attacked Green leaving him with two broken legs and a broken arm.

He then chased Cross before rugby-tackling him. He lay on top of the raider until police arrived.

Green claimed he did not steal anything despite pleading guilty to theft and being fined £75.

'I regret what happened that night but it makes me angry he's been turned into some sort of celebrity. He should have been punished.'

After being cleared at Cardiff Crown 
Court, a relieved Mr Woodhouse said: 'The verdicts show we have a 
criminal justice that works.

'When people act to defend themselves and their property it will not be considered unlawful.

'The last 10 months have been very harrowing for me, my family and the people I employ.'

He said he was 'gutted and sickened' to learn the extent of Green's injuries.

Mr Woodhouse employs six staff including two of his sons at the family business, which was set up 20 years ago.

The court heard how he didn't feel like officers had given him enough assistance when he had been the victim of crime.

Green and Cross were charged with theft and later given £75 fines by magistrates.

Mr Woodhouse had denied grievous bodily harm and grievous bodily harm with intent.

A Facebook page set up in his support saw 4,000 people give him their backing.

Mr Woodhouse's eldest son, marine Josh, 24, said afterwards: 'This prosecution should never have been brought.

'My father was doing what every right-minded person would do- protecting his family and his property.

'The stress it's caused him and the whole family has been unbelievable.'
