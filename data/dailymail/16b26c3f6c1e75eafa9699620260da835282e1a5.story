Police tried to smash a car window to rescue a young Queensland girl who was accidentally locked in the vehicle by her mother on Thursday.

Authorities were called to the Aldi car park in Gympie, north of Brisbane, after the distressed two-year-old started to overheat.

This comes as state roadside assistance bodies around Australia have revealed they are called to save thousands of children from locked cars each year, issuing a warning to parents and passersby to be extra vigilant as we enter the warmer months.

Authorities were called to the Aldi car park in Gympie, north of Brisbane, after a distressed two-year-old was locked in her mother's car

On Thursday Gympie police officer Steve Buchanan tried but could not smash his way into the vehicle with his baton while waiting for roadside assistance from the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ) to unlock the car, The Gympie Times reported.

He chipped and scratched the car but was unable to get in to the Mazda 3 hatch.

After a number of minutes the RACQ arrived and were able to unlock the rear passenger door.

The toddler, who was unharmed, jumped into her relieved mother's arms.

The RACQ said improved safety features and remote locking technology led to about 100 incidences per month of children needing to be rescued from locked in cars in Queensland alone.

A spokeswoman told the Times that cars could reach 40 degree temperatures within seven minutes, even in winter.

'Being exposed to such high temperatures in a car can kill or lead to severe injury for young children in a relatively short time,' she said.

Peter Khoury, spokesman for NRMA in NSW, said they had rescued 2179 children from locked cars in the past year.

'It becomes more alarming as we come into the summer months,' Mr Khoury said.

'In summer it doesn't take very long at all for the temperature to reach as high as 80 degrees â€“ that's almost cooking temperatures.

'It's not long at all for a child to become disoriented, agitated and then dehydrated and suffering organ failure.'

Mr Khoury said people should call police or their local roadside assistance body immediately if they saw a child locked in a car.

'If they consider the child to be in danger, break the car window, don't wait,' he said.

He also warned that is was illegal to leave a child unattended in a car, with the penalty carrying fines of up to $22,000.

The RACV in Victoria was called to 1500 cases of children locked in cars in the year leading up to July.

Victorian parliament recently discussed raising the penatly for leaving a child unattended in a car from fines of $2214 to $3690 and prison terms from one and a half months to three months.
