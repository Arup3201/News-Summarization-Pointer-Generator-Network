Neil Lennon accused fourth official Amy Fearn of being ‘a bit pedantic’ after his first management experience in English football ended with a rare win for Bolton and a red card.

The Northern Irishman was sent to the stands for leaving his technical area in the 83rd minute of the 1-0 win at Birmingham.

Lennon had already been warned by Fearn for racing down the touchline after Matt Mills’ first-half winner and was later dismissed by referee Mark Haywood when he tried to select a penalty taker following Darren Randolph’s late foul on Craig Davies. Davies, who was not Lennon’s choice, missed the kick.

Neil Lennon's Bolton won 1-0 against Birmingham, but the 43-year-old was sent to the stands during the match 

‘I got sent off for leaving tech area and walking on the pitch a few yards to give instructions,’ Lennon said. ‘She said I was consistently doing it, but you have to understand it was my first game. I’m not used to the ways down here in England.

‘I think it is very harsh, a bit pedantic. I wasn’t remonstrating with officials or the opposition. I have seen a lot worse in Scotland, put it that way.’

The former Celtic manager added: ‘A few times the lady warned me. I tried dealing with it with a bit of humour. I wanted to make a decent impression.’

Bolton’s second win of the season lifted them off the bottom of the Championship. Lennon added: ‘Let’s get out of the bottom three quick as we can. One out of one, it’s all I can ask.’
