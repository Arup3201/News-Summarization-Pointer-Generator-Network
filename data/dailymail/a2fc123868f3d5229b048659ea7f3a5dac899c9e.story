Australians have had the highest median wealth in the world for five consecutive years according to this year's Global Wealth Report.

Research by the Credit Suisse Group, which analysed wealth trends in countries and regions across the world, has revealed the median wealth per adult in Australia is estimated to be USD 225,400, or $257,704 as of June 2014 - with the median being the centre point between the highest and lowest figures.

The figure is significantly higher than the one recorded for the country in second place, Belgium, which has a median of USD 173,000.

Australia has the highest median wealth in the world at USD 225,400 ($257,704), according to the 2014 Global Wealth Report

In terms of average wealth, Australia comes in at second place behind Switzerland with USD 581,000 ($664,269) per adult.

Real assets, mainly housing, were found to make up 60 per cent of household wealth in Australia, averaging at USD 319, 700 ($365, 929).

'This average level of real assets is the second highest in the world after Norway,' the report stated.

Australia was also found to have 4 per cent of the world's US dollar millionaires, with 1,252,000 people falling into the category.

However, the country is only considered to have a 'medium' level of 'inequality' as the wealthiest 10 per cent share only 50-60 per cent of the nation's capital, as opposed to the 70 per cent shared by countries which are considered to have 'very high inequality'.

When compared to the rest of the world, Australia was revealed to have the highest percentage of people with more than USD 100,000 ($114,460) in wealth.

This is due to more than 1,700,000 Australians making up part of the top 1 per cent of global wealth holders, 'despite having just 0.4 per cent of the world's adult population'.

Real assets, mainly housing, were found to make up 60 per cent of household wealth in Australia, averaging at USD 319, 700 ($365, 929)

On the opposite side of the spectrum, the report stated that 'Only 6% of Australians have net worth below USD 10,000, which can be compared to 29% in the USA and 70% for the world as a whole.

'Household wealth in Australia grew at a fast pace between 2000 and 2014 in US dollar terms, except for a short interruption in 2008,' the report said.

'The average annual growth rate has been 11%, with about a third of the rise due to exchange rate appreciation.'
