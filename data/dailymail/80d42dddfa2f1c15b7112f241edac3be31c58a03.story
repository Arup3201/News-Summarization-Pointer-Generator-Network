This is the moment a trio of daredevil musicians took to the skies for a jamming session - dangling on a highline 1,000ft above a French gorge.

Climber Mich Kemeter and a group of friends attached a hammock to a highline 300 metres above the River Verdon so they could play music while enjoying the views.

Armin Holzer performed on his didgeridoo while Niccolo Zarattini played guitar for Mich and his girlfriend Karine while hanging from the rope with just one safety line.

The incredible pictures were captured by thrill-seeking photographer Alexandre Buisse who watched in awe as the group strolled casually across the highline to rig the hammock - and then chose to relax with an impromptu gig.

Alexandre, 27, said: 'It was both very cool and very funny. People like Mich, Armin and Niccolo like doing that kind of thing just because they can.

'There was no danger involved - though it was of course very impressive to be on the highline - but there was a hammock all rigged up, so why not make the best of it?

'They have been highlining for a number of years, and Mich is one of the best in the world right now.

'I know it was not the first time that Armin tried playing his didgeridoo on the line, but music on a highline is still a very new concept.'

The group then tested their gravity-defying abilities by hanging upside from the wire, clinging on with just their feet.

Mich, who is known for fearlessly pushing boundaries, crossed the line countless times to help Alexandre get the best shots to illustrate their talents.

Alexandre said: 'I shot this from the side of the cliff with various angles.

'They were pretty easy shots to get, as I could walk freely on the side of the cliff. I just had to be careful not to trip, as it's over 300m to the bottom of the gorges.

'But the guys were really relaxed and played a variety of tunes. Niccolo sang a number of country and reggae songs, sometimes changing the lyrics to match the activity.

'I mostly remember there was a rendition of Bob Marley's 'Get Up, Stand Up' when Mich walked back to the ground from the hammock.'
