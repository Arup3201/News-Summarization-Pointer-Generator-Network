Police believe Mary Ann Holder shot her sons, ex-lover, relatives, and son's girlfriend before committing suicide

The jilted lover who who shot her former boyfriend and five children had given the married man who ended their affair a cheque for $10,000 hours before her murderous rampage, it was revealed today.

Mary Ann Holder, who killed her two sons and blasted one of the boy's girlfriends while also shooting her niece and nephew, gave Randall Lamb the money in a Walmart parking lot in a bid to stop his wife Jennifer from suing her, say police investigating the possibility of extortion.

The next morning the 36-year-old met Mr Lamb in another parking lot in Greensboro, North Carolina, and during their meeting began firing her gun, hitting the 40-year-old once in his shoulder.

Holder went on to shoot in the head her sons Robert Dylan Smith 17, and Zachary
Smith, 14, who have both now died, before firing at Robert's girlfriend, Makayla Woods, 15, and killing her niece, Hannaleigh Suttles, eight.

She also injured her her 17-year-old nephew, Richard Suttles during the rampage on Sunday.

And in a final twist to her murder spree, the 36-year-old turned the gun on herself and committed suicide, meaning - including herself - the death toll currently stands as four as Miss Woods, 15, died this afternoon.

Major Tom Sheppard with the Guilford County Sheriff's Department said the cheque, made out to Mrs Lamb, was a 'settlement' to her threat to file an alienation 
of affection lawsuit against Holder.

Mrs Lamb filed a restraining order against Holder in February in which she claimed that the killer and her husband began an affair in 2008. The case was thrown out because neither the Lambs nor Holder showed up at court.

Five months later, Holder herself filed a restraining order against Mr Lamb in which she curiously claimed in filed documents that Mr Lamb would stop his wife from filing the lawsuit 'if I give him what he 
wants'.

Sheriff BJ Barnes, whose department issued a warrant to search the Lambs' house, told Fox 8 News: 'I want to know what the story is on that check. I want to know the 
documentation that goes with that.

'want to know if there if there is 
any coercion, if there is any extortion going on. I'm not saying any of 
that is there. I want to know if it's there'

Zachary Lee Smith, 14, died late Monday after being shot in the head over the weekend, authorities say

If any crime was 
committed by others, charges will be filed,Mr  Barnes said, adding: 'It's been a week from hell, not only for the family, but for the community.'

On Monday after Holder's fourth 
victim, her son Zachary died, Southeast Guilford County High School, 
whereattended as a freshman, released a statement, offering crisis teams
for families who were struggling to process the events.

It
read: 'The Guilford County Schools family has been greatly impacted by 
the violent and tragic incident that took place in our community on 
Sunday.

'We are continuing to work with law 
enforcement agencies with their investigation. Our thoughts and prayers 
are with the victims and their families.'

'I just can't believe it - my best 
friend is gone,' Nick Couch, 15, said. His mother Stacy had been friends
with Holder for ten years.

In a 911 call Sunday, Mrs Lamb told operators: 'I don't know exactly what happened, but my husband has been shot.

'He
just called me and said he was on the highway and that he had been 
shot. He was at - I don’t know for sure... I think he was at his work. 
And this woman who he had had an affair with... she was there when he 
got there and she shot him.'

Authorities said Mary Ann Holder shot both her 
sons - 17-year-old Robert Smith, left, and 14-year-old Zachary Smith, 
right - in the head. Robert was killed instantly, while Zachary 
succumbed to his wounds Monday

15, and killing her niece, Hannaleigh Suttles, eight.

And in a final twist to her murder spree, the 36-year-old turned the gun on herself and committed suicide.

‘We’ve got death. We’ve got drama. We’ve got a situation basically no one could ever imagine,’ Sheriff Barnes said

He added that it was 'one of the worst situations I've seen in my 30 years in law enforcement'

Investigators are trying to find out what could have motivated Holder to turn a gun on her children, her family, and herself. ‘We’re trying to find out why,’ Mr Barnes said. ‘We’ve come up with some probable solutions, but no one will ever really know.’

The gunwoman left behind two notes taking responsibility for the shootings. Sheriff Barnes said she apologised for the pain she caused but also that she felt 'wronged'..

The
tragedy unfolded shortly before 9am on Sunday when Holder met her 
one-time boyfriend Randall Lamb in the parking lot of the Guilford 
Technical Community College Aviation Centre in Greensboro, North 
Carolina.

They spoke 
briefly before Holder shot at him multiple times, before a bullet struck
him in the shoulder, investigators said. He remains in stable 
condition.

Mr Lamb phoned his wife from the car 
after the violent confrontation - and she then called 911, saying her 
husband had been shot, prompting deputies to begin a search for Holder.

They went to Holder's one-level brick residence on nearby Cocoa Drive in Pleasant Garden around 9:30am.

Officers were stationed outside her home, but a deputy spotted her car driving down the street about an hour later.

The deputy said he saw a 'puff of 
smoke' in the SUV and found Holder dead and her son Zachary  shot in the head. He died of his wounds late Monday.

Deputies recovered two handguns inside the vehicle, one in Holder's lap, the sheriff said.

The officers then went into Holder’s home and discovered her son Robert dead.

Inside they found Robert’s
injured girlfriend, Makayla Woods, along with Holder’s niece, Hannaleigh Suttles, eight, and her 17-year-old nephew, 
Richard Suttles.

Holder reportedly had custody of her nephew and niece after their mother died.

Hannaleigh died on Monday of her injuries. The other two remain in critical condition.

Neighbour Joe Scott told WRAL.com: 'It's beyond my imagination that a mother would - good children such as they were - that she would do any harm to precious children.'

Mr Scott's wife Teresa said: Holder's decision to take in her dead sister's children appeared to add to the pressures of what appeared to be a life in turmoil.

'Why would you take them children, keep them children, when your life's rocky, up and down?'

Mrs Scott said Holder began renting the home across the street about four years ago.

Holder's children were kind towards the elderly couple across the road, Mrs Scott added.

They volunteered to help with yard maintenance and enquired about the health of her husband Joe, who has had recent health problems.

In the past, Mr Lamb also appeared to like Holder's children, Mrs Scott said. 'They'd pack up things and go places together,' she said.

But it was also clear the affair between Holder and Mr Lamb had soured, according to Mrs Scott.

Robert Smith posted no-trespassing signs on trees in the front yard this year in response to the rising level of tension between Holder and Mr Lamb, Mr Scott said.

Mr Lamb’s wife also filed an 
alienation of affection claim, which in North Carolina allows someone 
who is cheated on to sue the person their spouse had an affair with.

The notes also indicate Holder was angry about how her relationship with Lamb came to an end.

The deadly shooting spree, in which three were left dead, started in the car park of the Guilford Technical Community College

Sheriff Barnes said: 'They were obviously shot for the 
purpose of killing them.

'You can call it an execution, you can call it a
shooting, you can call it whatever you want. The result is the same. We may never know exactly what her thoughts were and why'

Authorities yesterday said they were still 
trying to determine when the victims in Holder’s home were shot and 
whether it happened before or after she met with Lamb.

Sheriff Barnes said there were restraining orders filed, which had expired.
