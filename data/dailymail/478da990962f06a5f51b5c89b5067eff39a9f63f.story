This stunning moment of a kangaroo staring into a paradise landscape was taken at Lucky Bay in Esperance, Western Australia. 

The amazing shot was captured by professional photographer Cameron Hammond, 39, who was on holiday with his fiancée Rachel Gill at the pristine beach which has been rated one of the best in Australia. 

The couple, who live in Sydney, camped at the beach in the south-west corner of Cape Le Grande National Park for four nights and managed to hang out with the local residents- the western grey kangaroos.

Mr Hammond, who specialises in fashion photography and also works in television, told Daily Mail Australia the couple visited the beach after they had explored northern WA. 

'I was born in Esperance and I wanted to take Rach, who is from the US, and I wanted to show her the beauty of Australia. 

'We hired a camper and drove and hiked around the beach area for a few days, it wasn't until we drove onto the beach and were having a couple of red wines did we spot the kangaroos.

Like snow: 'The beach is just the most astounding place, the sand is like snow, even when you have sunnies on you get that reflection behind your glasses' 

'They were pretty far up the beach and we ended up getting out and hanging out with them in the sand dunes. 

'They were starting to wander up to the waters edge and Rachel was walking behind them. I was lucky enough to have my good camera so could get the shots.

The pristine coastline is one of the best beaches in Australia, it was named by explorer Matthew Flinders who discovered it in January 1802  

'We have been to Hyams Beach, Jervis Bay NSW which has the world record for the whitest sand but we are pretty sure the sand at Lucky Bay would beat it. 

'I felt really lucky to have the chance to capture these photos, it was very exciting because it was quite rare.' 

Miss Gill, 29, said: 'It was surreal and incredible.' 

Lucky Bay is located in Cape Le Grand National Park which is near Esperance in WA 

Mr Hammond, who lives in the inner city suburb of Redfern, said: 'The kangaroos are really well known at Lucky Bay, not ever gets the chance to get a good shot of them

'The sand is extra pure and white and we got lucky at Lucky Bay.'
