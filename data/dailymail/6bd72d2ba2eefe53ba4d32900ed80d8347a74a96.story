Police are investigating a second offensive message posted on social media about the tragic Glasgow bin lorry crash which killed six people.

North Yorkshire Police confirmed today that the force was 'aware of an offensive comment on social media' regarding the tragedy.

It follows the arrest of a 19-year-old man from Sunderland, who allegedly posted a crass message on Twitter following the incident on Monday.

Witnesses believe the lorry driver became ill behind the wheel and lost control of the vehicle. The lorry careered along the pavement in Glasgow centre on Monday before colliding with a hotel in George Square

Police said they were contacted by Facebook users over the latest offensive message, which was apparently made by a woman in York.

The force tweeted today: 'We are aware of an offensive comment on social media regarding the £georgesquare tragedy.

'We are assisting @policescotland with enquiries.'

The Sunderland teenager, who was arrested on suspicion of making a malicious communication on Monday, has since been released on bail, Northumbria Police said.

Officers are still carrying out investigations into the circumstances surrounding the crash, and are keen to determine what caused the bin lorry to career 300 metres along a crowded pavement.

Six people died and 10 were injured after the lorry apparently veered out of control in the city's George Square before crashing into the side of the Millennium Hotel.

The accident happened at about 2.30pm on Monday afternoon in the city's busiest square, which was packed with Christmas shoppers and families enjoying the annual winter carnival.

One witness described the lorry as knocking people down 'like pinballs' in the crash.

It is thought the driver may have fallen ill at the wheel as he travelled up Queen Street and his vehicle struck a pedestrian outside the Gallery of Modern Art.

Those who died have been named as student Erin McQuade and her grandparents Jack and Lorraine Sweeney, all from Dumbarton.

Primary teacher Stephenie Tait, Gillian Ewing and Jacqueline Morton were also killed when the council truck mounted the pavement.

Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board confirmed today that five patients, including a 14-year-old girl, were still being treated in hospital for injuries.

Dozens of floral tributes and candles have been placed at the scene of the crash, which has led to a huge outpouring of emotion in the city.
