The President of Ireland has been wrongly 'outed' as gay by a journalist writing for influential financial magazine, Forbes.

The New York-based business bible, famed for its rich list, has now apologised to President Michael D Higgins for claiming he was an 'acknowledged homosexual' in a piece on its website yesterday.

President Higgins has four children and is married to actress Sabina.

The article - about the US nominee for ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power - was written by David Monagan and was online for several hours.

The magazine said: 'Both Forbes and the author of the post David Monagan sincerely regret the error. Forbes is issuing an apology to President Higgins in a separate correspondence.

Forbes said the piece which was online for several hours yesterday contained a 'serious error'.

Eamon Gilmore, Ireland's deputy prime minister and a former colleague of President Higgins in the Labour Party, said the fact that the story was pulled speaks for itself.

'I understand it was online and it was taken down - I think that tells us everything we need to know about that article,' he said.

'It's probably more a source of embarrassment for the journalist who wrote it than for anyone else.'

Monagan, originally from the US but based in Co Cork, is part of Forbes.com's contributor network. The article did not go to print.

The article on Ms Power, originally from Ireland, looked back at past presidents of the country.

It stated: 'The current president of Ireland, Michael D Higgins, is a poet, acknowledged homosexual and nearly as outspoken as his predecessors.'

Monagan has said the mistake was the biggest error of his professional life.

It is understood a letter is being sent by Forbes senior management in New York to the President's office in Aras an Uachtarain in Dublin.

A spokesman for the President declined to comment on the controversy.

Monagan has been unavailable for comment today but in the hours after the article went live he reportedly said he felt horrible when he realised his mistake.

'I feel horrible. The story is that I made a mistake, for which I apologise from my heart. It was under deadline pressure and is inexcusable,' he said.

Monagan moved to Ireland from Connecticut in 2000 with his family and divides his time between Cork and Waterford.

Forbes, which bills itself as a leading source for reliable business news and financial information, uses fact checkers to substantiate stories after individual freelancers submit work for publication.
