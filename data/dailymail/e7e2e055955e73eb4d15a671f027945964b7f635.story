Number crunching slave master? 53-year-old Florida accountant Timothy Deegan was arrested Friday on charges he enslaved three women in his Gainesville home for months

A Florida accountant was arrested last week after police say they discovered he'd spent months living with three women he kept trapped as his personal sex slaves.

Officials also claim that 53-year-old Gainesville CPA Timothy Deegan was prostituing the women while keeping them on a tight leash with promises of cocaine and threats of violence.

For months, police allege Deegan monitored the three women with hidden cameras, raped them, pimped them out and put footage of their sex acts on the internet. All the while, average families were living their comfortable cul-de-sac lives all around him.

Deegan was booked on three counts of human trafficking by Alachua County officials on Friday, reports the Gainesville Sun.

It was the end to months of hell for the women, who were sex workers who'd had the misfortune of meeting Deegan in 2013. 

At first, authorities say Deegan would record the women having sex with each other and put the footage online.

But
 slowly, the Gainesville Sun notes, the women became increasingly 
fearful of the accountant as he took more and more control of their 
lives.

He
 fed them drugs, threatened them with guns and homemade weapons and even
 set up booby traps throughout his home and took the knobs off doors.

Police
 records show that Deegan monitored their movements using the GPS 
function on their phones and would call them with threats if they 
ventured too far.

'He
 was basically prostituting them out, in exchange for the money and the 
sex and the drugs,' said Alachua County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson 
Sergeant Becky Butscher told MyFoxOrlando.

Beyond the circular driveway: Neighbors called Deegan's home one of the neighborhoods most striking. Little did they know it was allegedly a house of horrors where the sick CPA forced women to have sex on camera and monitored their every move

Their
 relationship with Deegan had begun with the promise of drugs and had 
devolved into a life of sexual servitude, claim police.

'They
 stayed, because they were afraid. He made traps, he watched their every
 move. He kept them addicted to drugs,' Sergeant Butcher said.

The
 women even stayed after one of them managed to get Deegan arrested 
after she allegedly found a video he'd taken of himself raping her as 
she lay unconscious from sleep medication.

Now that sexual assault charge from December 2013 has been rolled in to the human trafficking charges Deegan has against him.

He remained jailed Wednesday in lieu of $300,000 bond.

Now,
 people like George Shorter of the area homeowner's association have 
been forced to think in wonder at how ignorant they were of the horrors 
behind Deegan's well-kept home's facade.

Fear and cocaine: Deegan reportedly monitored the women, who he met on a website for sex workers, using tiny video cameras and GPS on their phones. The women say he forced them to have sex with him and other men against their will as he plied them with fear and cocaine.

'I hate to say it but the shocking thing is we really knew so little about what went on in his house. It's maintained from the outside. It's one of the distinct properties in the neighborhood,' Shorter told the Gainesville Sun.

Shorter wondered why, after the December sex assault charge, the neighbors didn't know more.

'The first incident...happened months and months ago,' he said. 'And he kept returning, and more things would happen.

'A lot of us are questioning, why was this guy allowed to come back and live in our community?'
