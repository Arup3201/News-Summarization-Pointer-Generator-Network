There can be few offices in the world which could be worse places to work.

But spending much of his professional life wading waist-deep in unimaginably foul-smelling sewage water is all in a day's work for Rob Smith.

The hardy 64-year-old is chief flusher for London's sewage network, whose role is the spend days surrounded by rats and vomit-inducing smells as he clears blockages of congealed lard and faeces.

Tough day at the office: Rob Smith is in contention of the prize of having worst job in Britain - hacking out man-size 'fatbergs' from London's sewers

And despite what you'd imagine, he 
believes he has the best job in Britain - hacking out huge ‘fatbergs’ 
from the clogged waterways.

But Rob, who has been in the job for an incredible 20 years, has grown to love his smelly livelihood.

He said: 'At the end of the day, someone’s go to do it. Why not take pride in it?'

'I’m very proud to be a sewer man.'

To
maintain his social life - and relationship with his wife and family - 
he makes sure to shower regularly and ‘avoid people with sensitive 
noses’.

His travels through 
the ageing Victorian network has seen him come across everything from 
half a Mini Cooper to a live hand-grenade.

The biggest ‘fatberg’ he has encountered was found near Savoy Gardens. It was the size of a man and took two days to break down.

For one week a month he is on call 24-hours a day and if a blockage occurs he must drop everything and enter the sewer.

He says the network smells different depending on what time you go in and can sometimes smell ‘nice’.

Strong stomach: Rob Smith must have developed quite a strong stomach having spent the past 20 years working in the sewers

'In
a normal sewer the smell changes during the course of the day. If you 
go into most sewers during the early hours of the morning, predominately
it’s bath water, shower water and it’s quite fragrant.

'That,
of course, lessens during the course of the day and then you get the 
same thing in the evening when people are getting ready to go out.'

Despite all the high-tech equipment available, Rob maintains his ultimate safety weapon is his sensitive nose.

Dirty work: Rob Smith has performed the vital job of trying to keep London's sewers clear of blockages

Rob, from Little Wakering, Essex, said: 'We have to be very aware of our sense of smell. If I have a cold and I can’t smell then, strictly speaking, I shouldn’t go into a confined space because smell is a key component of keeping yourself safe.

'The monitors will pick up most things but your smell and your hearing tells you the other bits that you need to be 100 per cent safe.'

Thames Water is planning to combat the threat of ‘fatbergs’ by taking fat and oils directly from restaurants and build-ups in drains to power Britain’s biggest sewage works.

The grease will be fed into what will be the world’s largest fat-fuelled power station at Beckton in east London.

The plant will be able to produce 130 Gigawatt hours a year of renewable electricity - enough to run 39,000 average-sized homes.

Piers Clark, commercial director for Thames Water, said: 'This project is a win-win: renewable power, hedged from the price fluctuations of the non-renewable mainstream power markets, and helping tackle the ongoing operational problem of ‘fatbergs’ in sewers.'
