Manchester United's gazumping of neighbours City for Radamel Falcao will see the odds on their top-four finish fall, much like the torn-out pages of Louis van Gaal's big black tactics folder as he gets to work on his his new 3-2-5 formation.

While it isn't the solid-foundation defensive player that everyone outside of Ed Woodward's mission control believes United need, this signing is a goals guarantee and it also deals a blow to both Manuel Pellegrini and Arsene Wenger, for whom Falcao's prolific scoring profile would have been perfect.

One of the key reasons Real Madrid stepped back from signing him – and he has been on a plate for them all summer – is that it was understood he would eat into the goals tally of both Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale, not to mention replace the president's favourite Karim Benzema.

Strength: Falcao is physically very good, but will not want to play too much with his back to goal

Heading for greatness: As good in the air as on the floor, Falcao is a real handful for even the best defenders

Whereas the occasionally hapless-in-front-of-goal but unstintingly selfless Frenchman is happy to play best supporting actor to Bale and Ronaldo's leads, Falcao would have stolen the show. 

He would not have been running away from goal to vacate space for Ronaldo to fill, he would have been heading straight for the edge of the six-yard box where he has scored so many of his goals for River Plate, Porto and Atletico Madrid.

He scored 52 times in just 67 games for Diego Simeone in Spain and nine in 13 in World Cup qualifiers for Colombia before injury kept him out of the tournament.

He may not lead the line like Diego Costa, he may not have the variety of goals that Leo Messi has, the long-distance shooting of Ronaldo, the work-rate and sacrifice of Luis Suarez, the elegant touch of Roberto Lewandowski or the presence of Zlatan Ibrahimovic but as a straight up and down finisher Falcao is second to none.

'I watch the Premier League a lot,' he told Sportsmail last season, 'I like how competitive it is and how teams who are very direct in terms of looking for the opposition's goal as quickly as possible. The football goes back and forth and that makes it a fascinating league.'

Pedigree: The striker has scored goals wherever he has played, including 52 league goals in 68 games

That desire to be part of the attack-orientated Premier League is born of an inherent ability to see the space before any defender, run into it, and finish first time with maximum power and accuracy and the minimum fuss. 

He will thrive on the early balls into the area that Di Maria, Rooney and Juan Mata (if he survives the latest tactical readjustments) can provide.

Falcao was also at pains to make it clear that the physical side of English football would not be a problem in spite of his injury record. 

'The French league is also very physical. The players are very physical and all the teams are. Technically the top two might be ahead of the rest but physically all the teams are very strong,' he said.

United will be more than aware of the cruciate ligament tear in his right knee sustained at the end of 2013 but the decision of Colombia coach Jose Pekerman not to take the 28-year-old to Brazil and hope that he reached full fitness before the end of the tournament will help what is now his comeback season.

Short stay: Falcao's Monaco switch was always seen as a year out, and now it appears he has made his move

Loan star: The forward will join Manchester United on a season-long loan on a £200,000-a-week deal

Injury or no injury the feeling last season was that Falcao was taking a year out. The decision to go to Monaco always looked short-term. 

Even the Ligue 1 side seemed to have resigned themselves to losing him despite being back in the Champions League, hence their apparent willingness to let him move away.

A fan of the Colombian side Millionarios where Alfredo Di Stefano played, Falcao wants to go back and play for his local club one day before he finishes in the game.

First though, he says: 'I want to play in the English league a some time in my career.

'I hope to be playing for many more years yet in Europe.' 

Now after the pains of watching the World Cup from a distance, his time to make the move has come.
