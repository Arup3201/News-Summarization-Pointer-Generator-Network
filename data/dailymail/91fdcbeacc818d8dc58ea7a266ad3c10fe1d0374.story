Tourists visiting a popular Thai resort island are being warned to take care while swimming after a five-year-old boy was killed by a box jellyfish over the weekend.

The boy, from France, was holidaying with his family on the picturesque island of Koh Phangan when he was stung by one of the deadliest creatures in the world.

After the boy died, local authorities and beachfront hotels were asked to post signs warning of venomous jellyfish and prepare emergency kits for additional stings.

Tragic: A young boy died after he was stung by a box jellyfish on Khuad beach on the island of Koh Phangan

Yongyos Thammawut of the provincial public health office in Surat Thani told The Bangkok Post that the boy went into shock after he was stung by the poisonous tentacles of a box jellyfish on Khuad beach on Saturday.

He said the boy died as his parents and a guide were rushing him to a hospital on the island, located in the Gulf of Thailand.

The tentacles of fully grown box jellyfish can reach nearly 10 feet in length, and the creatures can be found in the waters off many Thai beaches that are popular destinations for swimming and snorkelling.

Lt Saengroj Somrotrat of the Thai police told AFP that the season for box jellyfish runs until the end of October.

He said: ‘We have asked [hotels and resorts] to help warn people and prepare emergency kits if people come into contact with the jellyfish.’

Deadly creatures: Box jellyfish, the world's most toxic jellyfish, can grow to nearly 10 feet in length

With about 5,000 stinging cells per tentacle, box jellyfish use their venom to stun or kill fish or other prey, but even a small amount can be lethal for humans.

Their venom disrupts the heart and nervous systems and can cause heart failure within minutes.

Medical professionals say all cases should be treated as urgent and potentially lethal.
