Robyn Gardner was buried alive in a dog’s grave dug up by her lover who taped a plastic bag over her head, the National Enquirer claims.

The allegation is the latest sensational development in the story of the Maryland woman, 35, who vanished two months ago while on holiday with Gary Giordano in Aruba.

Authorities have been searching for her since August and Giordano, 50, is currently being held in jail as they suspect he was involved in her death.

Police were given a tip by a man who claimed Giordano put a bag over her head and tied up her limbs with duct tape, reported the National Enquirer.

He allegedly then drove to Dog Graves Beach on the Caribbean island and dug up a dog’s grave with his bare hands, a source told the magazine.

‘He dug up a fresh dog’s grave with his hands, removed the dog’s body, widened the hole and put Robyn in it,’ they told the National Enquirer.

The source alleged Giordano then put the dead dog’s body on top of hers and then she started moaning and moving while he filled up the hole.

Giordano has been jailed for more than two months now on suspicion of involvement in her presumed death after she went missing on August 2.

But he denies any wrongdoing and says Miss Gardner was swept away while they were snorkelling off the Dutch Caribbean island.

The pair had gone travelling with each other on July 31 after reportedly meeting on a swingers’ website called Adult Friend Finder.

Giordano and Miss Gardner were last seen leaving the Rum Reef Bar & Grill restaurant on Baby Beach at about 4pm on August 2.

Two hours later, Giordano is seen alone on a security camera, wearing no top but with his toupee still in place.

He reported her missing and initially assisted the search but was later detained and arrested at the airport as he tried to flee the country.

After Gardner disappeared, Giordano inquired about claiming a $1.5million insurance policy on her life, which he filed on the day before the trip.

Shocking CCTV footage emerged showing missing Miss Gardner having a violent fight with Giordano hours before her disappearance.

He is alleged to have threatened to kill his friend while grabbing her by the neck and shoving her into an elevator on the last day she was seen alive.

Prosecutors need more evidence to charge him, but witnesses have come forward to claim he was sweating profusely on that August 2 day.

They say there was blood next to him on the beach and a large scratch mark on his throat.

His father, Frank Giordano has said his son is a 'not a monster' but a 'good human being, who is good to his family'.

Miss Gardner's boyfriend Richard Forester, 40, said the couple had a row before she left for Aruba.

Giordano is said to have read a text 
on her phone to Mr Forester, which said: 'I love you. I care about you. 
We'll sort this out when I get back.'
