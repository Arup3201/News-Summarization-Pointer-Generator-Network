Ed Balls will announce today that child benefit cuts will be extended for another two years under Labour

Child benefit cuts will be extended under a Labour government, Ed Balls will announce today.

The Shadow Chancellor will pledge to keep the cap imposed on millions of families by George Osborne for another two years.

But critics pointed out that he has spent the past four years opposing the Chancellor’s successful debt reduction strategy.

With polls suggesting Labour trails the Conservatives by 25 points on the economy, Mr Balls will use his conference speech to insist the party can be trusted to balance the books if it wins power in next year’s election.

He will say that Mr Osborne’s cap of one per cent on child benefit increases – a cut in real terms – would be extended into 2016/17, saving a further £200million. Winter fuel allowances would be stripped from better-off pensioner.

Incoming Labour ministers would take a five per cent pay cut and have their pay frozen until its deficit targets are met – mirroring a pledge by Mr Osborne when the Coalition came to power in 2010.

Senior Conservatives said Mr Balls’ announcements involved ‘tiny’ savings in terms of the vast budget deficit that needs to be plugged.

Analysis published today claims that Labour tax policies could cost the UK 300,000 jobs and more than £25billion in GDP. The Centre for Policy Studies report analyses ten major tax announcements made by the Opposition, including an increase in corporation tax for most firms from 20 per cent to 21 per cent, a new top rate of income tax of 50p, a mansion tax on expensive homes, and a new financial transactions tax.

In his speech, Mr Balls will insist: ‘Labour’s economic plan will balance the books. But an economic plan must do much more than that. We also need to change the way our economy works. Because while our economy is growing again most working people are still not seeing any benefit from the recovery.

‘This is our task: not to flinch from the tough decisions we must make and to show the country that there is a better way forward. Labour’s plan for Britain’s future: to build an economy that works for the many, and not just a few – for all working people in every part of our United Kingdom.’

He will insist Labour ‘won’t duck the difficult decisions’ on the economy, adding: ‘Working people have had to balance their own books.

‘So Labour will balance the books in the next parliament. These will be our tough fiscal rules. We will get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling as soon as possible in the next parliament.

‘The next Labour government will get the deficit down. And Ed Miliband and all my Shadow Cabinet colleagues are clear it will mean cuts and tough decisions and we will take the lead.’

Announcing the extension of the cap on increases in child benefit, he will add: ‘We will have to make other decisions which I know will not be popular with everyone.

‘At a time when the public services that pensioners rely on are under such pressure, we will stop paying the winter fuel allowance to the richest five per cent of pensioners.

‘I want to see child benefit rising again in line with inflation in the next parliament, but we will not spend money we cannot afford. So for the first two years of the next parliament, we will cap the rise in child benefit at one per cent.’

Tory MP and Exchequer Secretary Priti Patel said: ‘This speech isn’t a serious plan for the economy – Labour would put the deficit up, not down.

‘For all his bluster, Ed Balls still refuses to admit that Labour spent too much and he’s opposed every decision we’ve taken to cut the deficit. All a Labour government would offer is more inefficient spending, more taxes and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.’

n Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has pledged to scrap elected Police and Crime Commissioners, branding the policy ‘fundamentally flawed’. The move would save £50million which could be ploughed back into frontline policing, she said.
