Almost 30-years-ago, William Potts hijacked a passenger airliner bound for Miami to fly him to Cuba where the Black Panther hoped he would be welcomed with open arms by fellow Marxist revolutionaries.

Instead, the New York native was sentenced to 15-years hard labor by Fidel Castro's government and now the man described as the 'homesick hijacker' wants to return to the United States to apologize to the people who he terrorized back in 1984.

However, it seems the U.S. government wants nothing to do with the man who still considers himself a revolutionary and who also believes his time in Cuban prison should override the indictment he would surely face back in America for airplane hijacking.

William Potts calls himself the 'Homesick Hijacker': Almost 25 years ago, he smuggled a pistol onto a commercial flight, diverted the plane to Havana, and spent 13 1/2 years in a Cuban prison for air piracy

In 1984, Potts' radical political ideology left him convinced he needed to leave the United States for Cuba - but then, as now, American citizen's travel to the Caribbean island was limited because the U.S. government considers Cuba a sponsor of terrorism.

Putting his plan into action, Potts disguised a .25-caliber pistol inside a fake cast in his arm and walked through security at Newark Airport.

As the plane took off, Potts entered the bathroom and changed into his 'Black Panther costume' of dark clothes and combat boots - walking out with the pistol in his hand.

Potts pushed his call button and gave the flight attendant a note saying he had two accomplices aboard with explosives. He now says he told the lie to 'avoid confrontations.'

He claimed to be Lt. Spartacus, a soldier in the Black Liberation Army. But now he says he was never actually a formal member of the violent Marxist group, and that he knew the hijacking would be nonviolent.

Cuban leader Fidel Castro caused Potts to become so infatuated with Cuba's communist way of life that he was willing to hijack a plane, even though he spoke no Spanish, knew no one on the island and expected to go to prison

He was so infatuated with Cuba's communist way of life that he was willing to hijack a plane, even though he spoke no Spanish and knew no one on the island.

While the pilot tried to talk him around, Potts used his weapon to his advantage.

'I had to be forceful with him,' Potts remembered during an interview with CNN. 'I tell him, if we don't go to Cuba, this plane is going down. We are going to hell or Cuba.'

As the plane came into land hours later, Potts said that he checked out the window for McDonald's and Coca Cola signs to make sure he was definitely about to set foot in the Communist country.

However, on landing, he ended up in the fearsome Combinado del Este prison just outside Havana.

Now 55, he argues he has paid his debt — and that prison time-served in Cuba should allow him to head back to America a free man.

Incredibly, authorities in Cuba had offered to let him return with the plane at the time - but he believed his revolutionary brothers would treat him well - even as his sentence for air piracy was read out.

'I thought I had won the case, and they gave me 15 years,' Potts said to CNN, recalling his brief court proceedings in Cuba.

'I didn't even know what 15 was in Spanish. And they said 'quince.' I said, what is 'quince?' and my translator said 15 years.

'And I said, '15 years for who?' And they said, '15 years for you.'

Potts served 13-and-half years.

He still faces an indictment for air piracy in Florida federal district court that could carry a 20-year prison sentence.

Potts married twice since his release and has two daughters from his second marriage called Ntann, 7, and Assata Shakur, 11, named after Assata Shakur, aunt of slain rapper Tupac Shakur.

A black separatist, she was sentenced to life imprisonment for the 1973 killing of a New Jersey police officer and had ties to former Weather Underground radical Bill Ayers, who became a campaign issue for President Obama in 2008 because he and Ayers served on the same Chicago community board.

Now, Potts works on a farm eeking out a meagre existence, trying to find a way home.

He told CNN that raising his daughters made him realize that they needed to see the country of his birth and to see their American family.

His four year campaign to return home saw him write to President Obama in 2009, to request a pardon for the hijacking - however, he heard nothing back.

Then he wrote to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami to request a plea deal for the outstanding charges - again he heard nothing back.

'I regret taking the plane and putting those people's lives in jeopardy,' he said to CNN. 'I didn't have that perspective at the time, but I have it now and will have it until the day I die. I would have been responsible for all those people dying.'

In the meantime, his daughter's were handed U.S. citizenship and passports and returned to live his relatives in December, while Potts still waits for news from the U.S. Attorney's office in Miami.

The issue of why his own government will not respond to Potts dates back to the tensions that have existed between the United States and Cuba since Fidel Castro's revolution in 1958.

In the 1960s and early '70s, there were dozens of American hijackings to Cuba — so many that they became fodder for standup comedians. As a way of discouraging them, both sides signed a 1971 agreement under which each government agreed to prosecute hijackers or return them to the other country.

Still, periodic tensions with Washington often pushed Cuba to suspend the deal, and many fugitives reaching Cuba got asylum — bank robbery suspects, Puerto Rican independence fighters, Black Panthers leaders such as Eldridge Cleaver. They were treated as political refugees — a key reason why the U.S. still labels Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism.

The U.S. has no extradition treaty with this country, and in some ways, they have become wanted Americans whom no one is after. Washington can't even provide updated information on who is believed to be in Cuba, referring The Associated Press to an outdated FBI list of 78 U.S. fugitives — at least four of whom are known to be dead.

Cuba stopped giving new arrivals sanctuary in 2006, so far returning four wanted Americans who recently had fled to avoid prosecution.

But some famous ones are thought to remain, such as Assata Shakur and Victor Gerena, a Puerto Rican separatist. He is still on the FBI's 'Ten Most Wanted' fugitive list for a 1983 armed robbery of an armored car company in Connecticut.

Shakur escaped from prison and made it to Cuba. Though she remains underground, Potts says he ran into her at a Havana book fair last year. Gerena and Shakur still have $1 million bounties for their arrest. As recently as 2005, Fidel Castro said U.S. racism made Shakur a 'true political prisoner.'
