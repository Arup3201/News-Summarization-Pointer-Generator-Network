Sony Pictures' embarrassment over leaked details of its business deepened today as hackers released the aliases used by its stars to travel incognito.

The latest cache of confidential documents leaked from Sony's archives includes the assumed names actors and actresses use to check into hotels and book car services.

Daniel Craig, Natalie Portman, Ice Cube and Jessica Alba will all be forced to switch their pseudonyms after their details were published online by the so-called Guardians Of Peace hacker group.

Contact details: The secret aliases and contact details of Hollywood stars - including, from left, Daniel Craig, Natalie Portman and Brad Pitt - are among the latest documents stolen by hackers from Sony Pictures

The new leaks also reportedly include contact details, including phone numbers, for the likes of Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks, as well as film budgets, scripts, details of legal claims and private employee information.

The latest batch of leaked files includes a folder containing 'publicity bibles' for many recent Sony Pictures releases which include phone numbers and email addresses for cast and crew on film sets, Fusion reports.

They reveal that Tom Hanks sometimes travels under the pseudonyms 'Harry Lauder' or 'Johnny Madrid'; Tobey Maguire goes as 'Neil Deep'; while Jessica Alba adopts the rapper-esque name 'Cash Money'. 

The St. Regis Bangkok is a glittery five-star luxury hotel in the Thai city's richest shopping district. Authorities say they have traced the attack to the hotel's internet network

The St. Regis has rooms that start at $250 a night and go up to $10,600 for the penthouse suite, which comes with its own butler

We have already given our clear demand to the management team of SONY, however, they have refused to accept.

It seems that you think everything will be well, if you find out the attacker, while no reacting to our demand.

We are sending you our warning again.

Do carry out our demand if you want to escape us.

And, Stop immediately showing the movie of terrorism which can break the regional peace and cause the War!

You, SONY & FBI, cannot find us.

We are perfect as much.

The destiny of SONY is totally up to the wise reaction & measure of SONY.

North Korean officials have denied accusations they are behind the hacking raid on Sony Pictures, despite increasing evidence apparently linking the pariah state to the attack. But they called it a 'righteous deed'.

A theory has been that North Korean hackers targeted the film company out of anger at the release of The Interview, starring James Franco and Seth Rogen as TV reporters hired by the CIA to assassinate Kim Jong Un. Yesterday a missive apparently posted by the hackers on code-sharing site GitHub Gist demanded Sony 'stop immediately showing the movie of terrorism which can break the regional peace and cause the war!' 

Bloomberg News reports that investigators have traced the attack last weekend back to the St. Regis Bangkok hotel, a five-star resort in Thailand's capital. Authorities are not sure whether the hackers stayed as guests at the hotel, simply used the wifi in the lobby, or routed the traffic through the hotel. The luxury resort has rooms starting at $250 per night, going up to the penthouse suite, which features a private pool and a personal butler for $10,600 a night.

The attack on Sony Pictures may have been the result of the studio producing 'The Interview,' which is a comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un

North Korea has already reacted angrily to 'The Interview,' which stars James Franco and Seth Rogen

The St. Regis Bangkok is owned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts, a Connecticut-based company that also owns Westin, Sheraton and the W hotel chains. 

The St. Regis, a glittering high-rise hotel, is located on Rajadmari Road in a section of Bangkok known for its high-end boutiques for the likes of Bulgari and Valentino.

Sources tell Bloomberg that forensic evidence indicates that the Sony attack was carried out by the same hackers who pulled off the DarkSeoul cyber assault of South Korean banks and media companies in 2013. 

The DarkSeoul hackers were linked to North Korea, which employs at least 5,900 hackers - many of whom operate outside the country, where electricity is unreliable and internet access is scarce.

According to details released by the FBI, key pieces of the malware used in the attack have the same names and construction as the malware used in the DarkSeoul attack. 

In both attacks, hackers also defaced websites with skeletons and political slogans.
