Church documents dating back to the 1700s have been discovered by two historians and reveal scandalous details about the private lives of early American settlers.

The confessions have been kept for centuries in Congregational churches from the colonial-era across Massachusetts. 

However, they have now seen the light of day again thanks to two historians James Fenimore Cooper Jr, who is a professor at Oklahoma State University, and Margaret Bendroth, executive director of the Congregational Library in Boston.

Historic: Documents were found buried in a church in Middleborough, Massachusetts

Documents included an application from a slave called Cuffee to join the congregation of a church in Middleborough in 1773.

At the same congregation, John Briggs admitted he been 'left to fall into the sin of fornication, by which it appears to me, I have not only wounded my own soul but great dishonoured God.'

Priscilla Cushman confessed in 1763 that she too had fallen to the 'sin of fornication, to the great dishonour of God', while Jedidiah Lyon admitted in 1786 that he 'was unwarily overcome with strong liquor, in the view of several persons present, by which conduct I have greatly dishonoured God'.

The records are now being stored at the Congregational Library in Boston, Massachusetts.

The town of Middleborough was incorporated in 1669 and settled by a group of men from Plymouth. 

The
 first meetinghouse was built in 1680 and the First Church of Christ 
(also called the Church at the Green) was officially organised in 1694.

Benjamin Franklin is among those who preached at the Middleborough church

Among
 those who preached there were Judge Peter Oliver, the last Chief 
Justice under the British King, Benjamin Franklin and statesman Sir 
William Temple.

Dr
 Cooper told the New York Times: 'There is no other discrete set of 
sources that will similarly transport us into colonial America.'

European nations came to the Americas to increase their wealth and broaden their influence over world affairs. 

The Spanish were among the first Europeans to explore the New World and the first to settle in what is now the United States.

By 1650, however, England had established a dominant presence on the Atlantic coast.

The first colony was founded at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607.

Many of the people who settled in the New World came to escape religious persecution. 

The Pilgrims, founders of Plymouth, Massachusetts, arrived in 1620. 

In both Virginia and Massachusetts, the colonists flourished with some assistance from Native Americans. 

New World grains such as corn kept the colonists from starving while, in Virginia, tobacco provided a valuable cash crop.

By the early 1700s enslaved Africans made up a growing percentage of the colonial population. 

By 1770, more than two million people lived and worked in Great Britain's 13 North American colonies.
