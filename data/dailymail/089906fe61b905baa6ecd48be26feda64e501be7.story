Two aspiring rappers who flew to North Korea to film a music video have released the result of their trip, offering a fascinating glimpse into the repressive regime.

Pacman and Peso, real names Anthony Bobb and Dontray Ennis, shot the video for their track Escape To North Korea in and around the capital of Pyongyang in November last year.

The two young men from Washington DC returned to the U.S. unscathed, despite rapping both in front of Kim Jong-il's mausoleum and the border to South Korea.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Return To North Korea: Washington DC rappers Pacman and Peso, real names Anthony Bobb and Dontray Ennis, spent five days in and around Pyongyang to film their music video

Pacman, 19, and Peso, 20, raised more than $10,000 through a crowdsourcing campaign on Kickstarter and arranged their trip through a travel agency specializing in taking Westerners to North Korea.

Americans are able to travel to North Korea on arranged tours and are constantly accompanied by North Korea minders.

Pacman and Peso managed to film their video using a small handheld camera, shooting when their minders looked away.

The idea for the video came from their manager Ramsey Aburdene, 25, who had a contact specializing in getting foreigners into Pyongyqang, the duo told The Guardian.

What would Dear Leader say? Pacman and Peso can be seen rapping in front the mausoleum of Kim Jong-un and Kim Il-sung as well as other monuments

The video shows Pacman and Peso in 
various locations in and around the North Korean capital, including in a
 school, on the city metro and by the border to South Korea.

The pair
 are seen rapping in front of the mausoleum of Kim Il-sung and Kim 
Jong-il, the grandfather and father of the country's dictator Kim 
Jong-Un, by a rice field and walking through Pyongyang.

Although 
Pacman and Peso returned unscathed, their funding campaign had attracted
 worldwide media attention, risking their safety.

'All the buzz we were getting, I thought we were gonna get hemmed up, captured,' Pacman told the Guardian.

The
 rappers said they encountered no problem while in North Korea. 'They 
treated us well, like I was sick out there for good two days and they 
took care of me until I got over the sickness,' Peso said.

Covert mission: The duo were constantly watched by minder as they visited government approved tour sites, so filmed when they looked away

Americans are able to travel to North Korea on arranged tours and are constantly accompanied by North Korea minders.

Speaking upon their return to Beijing, the two rappers said their trip shied away from politics.

'I mean we did not go there to be 
political. We just go down there to shoot our video and that about the 
reason why we went, not political,' said Pacman.

'Nobody
 shot a video in North Korea, let alone thought of it. Nobody even 
thought of making a video in North Korea. You know what I'm saying?' 
said Peso.

North
 Korea has detained at least six Americans since 2009, including 
journalists accused of trespassing and others accused of trying to 
spread Christianity.

North
 Korean state media claimed Saturday that 85-year-old Korean War veteran 
Merrill Newman had apologized for committing 'hostile acts' against the 
state during a trip in October, but the report could not be 
independently verified.
