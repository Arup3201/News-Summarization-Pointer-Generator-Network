A stunning video of professional skiers wearing  custom-made LED suits as they glide down  mountain slopes looks set to show the sport in a completely new light.

The film, shot in Alaska, shows world class skiers wearing incredible LED suits as they perform spectacular stunts  down pristine snowy slopes at night.

The 12 minute film called Afterglow was shot by a team from Sweetgrass Productions and  released on the website Vimeo, according to Wired.

Stunning: The feature length film was filmed in Alaska and shows world class skiers wearing incredible custom-made LED suits as they glide down pristine snowy slopes at night

Skiers: Pep Fujas and Eric Hjorleifson, two of the best skiers in the world took on the daunting task

 

It was created by a team led by co-director Nick Waggoner who said that they all wanted to shake up the genre of skiing films as it had become stale.

The team used the dazzling effects of the colored lights which reflected off the snow, lighting up the darkness to create stunning scenes.

Skiers Pep Fujas and Eric Hjorleifson, two of the best skiers in the world took on the daunting task of skiing down the rugged Alaskan terrain and found it difficult during the night shoot.

They filmed during the day and  worked mostly at night, draping the skiers in giant light suits and hauled gigantic, high-powered lights into the backcountry and lit up entire mountains as a backdrop. 

‘Deep pillows and Alaskan spines, all filmed at night, with massive lights, custom made LED suits, and a national governments worth of logistics, planning, and civil engineering,’ said the filmmakers.

And it is unlike anything seen before.

The creative team had to take care of the LED suits, which had 7,000 LEDs sewn onto each skiers’ gear.

Slope: The team  used eight 4,000-watt lights, accented with smaller lights and gels to add contrast and fill

Often, some of the lights would burn out  bringing filming to a halt while repairs were made.

And the team faced other challenges whilst navigating the snow covered mountains.

It proved to be a difficult task as the snow occasionally blew and billowed up around them creating conditions which are similar to  driving with your bright lights on in a snowstorm.

‘A couple times the skiers were like, ‘Holy shit, that was scary,’ Waggoner said.

However, unperturbed, the team lit up entire mountains and used eight 4,000-watt lights, accented with smaller lights and gels to add contrast and fill. 

The lighting and filming gear—which included several RED EPIC cameras and an octocopter—weighed 9,000 pounds. 

The ambitious crew got the equipment  up the mountain in a helicopter, but there were also times when it was loaded into sleds and hauled up by hand.

They needed five airplanes to haul everything in.

‘We wanted to do whatever we could to push the visual envelope,’ Waggoner said. i

They split filming into different segments, capturing the tree segments  in British Columbia in late March, and  steep skiing,  in mountains of the Alaskan Range in April.

Most of the filming took place at the Golden Alpine Holidays Sentry Lodge, Alyeska Resort, and the Alaskan Wilderness.

Now, Waggoner  hopes Afterglow will change the way that  ski films are seen. 

‘We had a pretty crazy dream and I’m just glad we had the means to realize it,’ he said.
