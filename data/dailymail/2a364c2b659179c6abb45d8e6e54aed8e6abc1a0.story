British prisoners of war who died in German camps in the First World War have finally been honoured with proper war graves.

Thirty-nine servicemen who were held in the Heilsberg prisoner camp were commemorated in a ceremony today at the site, which is in modern-day Poland.

The men, some of them just teenagers, were buried in a common grave after they died from disease and mistreatment while incarcerated.

Ceremony: The dead were memorialised by a gun salute from Polish soldiers

Long process: The men died during the First World War, but have only just received full headstones

Remembrance: Tourists visiting Heilsberg prisoner camp paid their respects

Political unrest in the region, which 
was behind the Communist Iron Curtain for decades, meant that families 
of the men struggled to have their graves properly recognised.

Instead, their names were put on a memorial plaque in Malbork, about 75 miles away.

But now the Commonwealth War 
Graves Commission arranged for today's ceremony at Lidzbark cemetery, where 39 
white headstones were dedicated to the servicemen buried there.

British Ambassador Robin Barnett and local governor Artur Jankowski led the ceremony, and 39 schoolchildren held grave lanterns lit by candles at each of the headstones.Â 

Information about the dead was collected
 by the Western Front Association, a British non-governmental 
organization that preserves the memory of World War I soldiers, and by 
Pauline Page-Jones, an amateur historian from Llanfyllin, Wales, where 
one of the prisoners was from.

Pvt. William Gordon Jones, 19, of The Durham Light Infantry, died of pneumonia at Heilsberg camp hospital on Oct.30, 1918, less than a year after joining the army.

Jones' two nephews, John Gordon Jones, 68, and Owen Wyn Jones, 63, came from Llanfyllin, where the family still lives, with a poppy wreath. They were the first family members to be able to visit his burial site.

John Gordon Jones said: 'It was very emotional and, my brother and I, we are very touched by it all'.

'We were able to pay respect to our uncle in this very much delayed ceremony. We are very grateful for this.

'The fallen should be remembered because they gave their lives for the rest of us, didn't they?'
