It's a cold enough night for two young women walking a Rottweiler dog to be wrapped up in thick winter coats and warm wooly hats.

But the pair are not two dog lovers braving bracing temperatures to take their beloved pet for a winter walk.

The callous pair were in fact captured on CCTV abandoning the starved animal in bitterly cold conditions outside a West Sussex hotel.

Cruel: RSPCA inspectors are appealing for help to find these two women who abandoned a starving Rottweiler outside a hotel in West Sussex

Starving: The severely emaciated dog, named Hero by the hotel staff who found him, weighed less than half the normal weight of an adult male Rottweiler

RSPCA inspectors have released the shocking footage captured close to the Crown Hotel in Littlehampton last Wednesday night.

The clip shows the two women approaching a gated area outside the hotel shortly after 8pm.

One of the women appears to spot the CCTV camera and begins to back away, but after a short conversation with her accomplice leads the dog towards the gated area and begins to tie the lead to the metal fencing while the second woman looks on.

Eventually, her accomplice, thought by RSPCA inspectors to be heavily pregnant, comes to help her friend tie the dog up.

The pair look at the camera again and seem to weigh up the risks of being caught abandoning the dog before they hastily retreat, closing a gate behind them.

An RSPCA inspector described the animal, later named Hero when he was found by pub staff, as 'one of the thinnest' dogs he had seen as the charity appealed for help in finding the pair.

Callous: The pair, dressed in warm winter clothes, appeared to back off into the darkness when they spotted the CCTV camera

Caught on camera: One of the women decides that it is worth the risk of getting caught to abandon the dog and begins to tie its lead to a gate post

Help: The second woman, thought to be heavily pregnant, comes to the aid of her friend as she struggles with the dog lead

Escape: After looking at the CCTV camera once more, the pair make off closing a gate behind them as they go

The emaciated dog weighed less than half the normal body weight of a dog his size when he was handed over to the charity.

Inspector Tony Pritchard said: 'This poor dog was completely emaciated, one of the thinnest dogs I have seen.

'A male adult Rottweiler should weigh 50-60 kgs but this dog weighed just 22 kgs.

'He was simply starving and now all he wants to do is eat.'

The RSPCA appealed for anyone who recognises the women to call 0300 1234 999.
