If the temperature is falling outside, expect the atmosphere in your car to become similarly frosty.

The number of family in-vehicle rows rises during winter months, according to a survey.

As many as 54 per cent of motorists say they have ‘carguments’ at this time of year, an RAC poll found.

A poll by the RAC revealed 54 per cent of motorists say they have 'carguments' at this time of the year

Simon Williams, spokesman for the breakdown company, which carried out the survey of 1,200 drivers, said: 'Arguments can break out between family and friends at any time, but in the winter, where journeys can be delayed or take longer as a result of having to defrost windscreens or take alternative routes, it can be particularly stressful.’

'If
 you can allow more time to get everything and everyone organised before
 your journey you will no doubt reduce the stress level which then eases
 the pressure on your drive.'

Rows erupting over directions or squabbling children were singled out as two of the most common reasons for arguments in the car

According to the poll, 15 per cent of drivers and passengers said they argue more in the car than anywhere else.

Almost one in five think the act of driving itself causes them to get stressed and angry, while 13 per cent blame in-car spats on disagreements over the best route to take. 

The poll also showed that drivers argued most with their partners – 43 per cent – followed by their children and parents.

Talking with passengers was seen as the biggest distraction, with as many as 21 per cent of drivers saying they feared a heated discussion could have caused an accident.
