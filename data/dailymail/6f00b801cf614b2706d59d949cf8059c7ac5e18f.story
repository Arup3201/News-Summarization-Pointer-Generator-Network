This is just one of the 37 castles in Italy that luxury real estate firm, Lionard, currently has for sale

Though many price tags may seem high, CEO Dimitri Corti insists that historic properties will always be a wise economic investment

While Luxury real estate company Lionard currently has 37 castles for sale, there are more than 70 throughout Italy in their portfolio.

Many owners, whose properties have been in the family for generations, have opted to sell due to high maintenance costs and an increasing tax burden.

But for foreign clients, these prices are relatively affordable, insists the CEO of Lionard Luxury Real Estate, Dimitri Corti. 

'In our experience, purchasing a property of great value, like a castle or historic villa will always translate into opportunity because it gives an economic boost to the local area,' Corti explains.
