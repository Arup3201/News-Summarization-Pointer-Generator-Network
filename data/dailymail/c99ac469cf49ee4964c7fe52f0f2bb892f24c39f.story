They are calling it the greatest cherry harvest ever, with the trees leaning over, drooping beneath the weight of their deep red fruit. Pickers are working every daylight hour in Kent and Herefordshire.

After a campaign to revive British cherry farming, this most luscious of fruits is back and — thanks to this year’s weather — yields are nearly treble those of 2012.

The cherry-growing harvest is expected to be worth £20 million, up from just £7.5 million last year, and the season is set to last longer than ever, well into September. ‘Last year we picked 100 tonnes. This year we expect to pick 250,’ says Sarah Neaves, a third generation cherry farmer from Kent.

‘This season has been great for us due
 to the dry weather and plenty of light, but we also had a very cold 
winter, which cherry trees like because they can hibernate.’

Cold
 and frosty weather allows the trees to ‘shut down’ and build reserves 
of energy for blossoming and fruit. It also kills pests and fungus that 
can wreck harvests.

family’s farm near Sittingbourne. The Neaves’ orchards are planted in 
small, hedgerow-lined fields, with tall poplars acting as windbreaks.

At one end are the beehives, home to the all-important pollinators.

On every tree, perfectly firm and shiny cherries in varying shades of crimson are decadently large. Each bunch, the size of a man’s hand, must weigh a pound. And between the glossy dark leaves, there are at least one hundred bunches on every tree.

The pickers, wearing traditional leather-belted wicker baskets around their hips, bury themselves among the leaves to get to the fruit.

‘We only pick fruit that has reached 
the right shade — the colour tells you how ripe the fruit is,’ says 
Sarah. ‘Cherries continue to ripen after picking, but only a little, so 
it’s important to pick them when they are perfect.’

Seven years ago, the Neaves’ farm had 30 acres of old cherry trees, but they mainly grew apples and pears.

Cherry farming had dramatically declined. Where there had been 5,000 hectares of cherry orchards in Kent at the beginning of the 20th  century, by the end there were just 600.

‘The fruit was small and the quality low. The supermarkets were buying cheap fruit from France,’ says Sarah.

After we joined the Common Market, British fruit growers, who did not get an agricultural subsidy, found they could not compete with cheaper imports. Thousands of acres of cherry orchards were destroyed.

Supermarkets used to be full of cheap fruit from France, but there's a renewed interest in homegrown food

Ten years ago, with a new interest in 
home-grown produce and the Cherry Aid campaign led by Henrietta Green of
 the crusading Food Lovers Britain movement, farmers looked again at 
cherry farming. Richard Harnden, director of research for Berry Gardens 
Growers, says that the old way of farming cherries had to go. We needed 
to adopt the practices of French, German and Belgian growers in order to
 compete.

‘In Kent’s orchards, we grew huge trees, so long wooden ladders were needed for picking,’ he says.

‘It was picturesque, but it was just not practical. With today’s health and safety considerations, pruning and picking would be impossible.’

The trees in the Neaves’ new orchards are small. Just before they blossom, they are enclosed by metal frames covered with rain-proof plastic and netting at the sides to protect the fruit from its great enemy — birds.

The Gisela dwarf rootstock that the Neaves planted in 2006 is German: the bushy, high-yielding trees can be easily picked and covered for protection in the growing season.

Their farm, Little Sharsted, is no longer little with 85 acres planted with cherries. The family has grown fruit there for more than 50 years. Sarah’s grandfather Archie took on the farm, and her father Brian followed him. Sarah, 46, went into insurance when she left school, but came back to the farm at the age of 23.

She runs it with her brother Edward and farm manager William Dixon. They work with eight other farms in Kent, Herefordshire and Scotland, growing fruit for supermarkets. An old barn is now a packing plant.

They employ some locals, but most of the 60 pickers and packers are students from Lithuania, Bulgaria and Romania. The conditions in which they live and work, their pay and hours are bound by ethical audits. Many return season after season.

The new British cherry is very different to the fruit you used to see being sold by the side of the road or in markets in the towns and cities.

During a short season in July, you could 
pick up a brown paper bag of small, firm, bright red cherries weighed 
out by the pound. They were a real treat. When I was a little girl, my 
friends and I would hang pairs of cherries from our ears as pretend 
earrings. It was the Seventies and our mothers would never have allowed 
us to get our ears pierced, so the seasonal summer cherry served as a 
delightful — and edible — substitute.

The fruit we loved then are now 
heritage varieties, which originated from the wild Mazzard or Gean tree,
 which grew up to 75 ft high (you can only imagine the health and safety
 issues involved in picking them).

Varieties
 derived from these ancient trees include the romantically named Merton 
Heart, Roundel Heart, Florence and Waterloo. Today, few of these are in 
commercial production, but some survive in old kitchen gardens and 
ancient orchards.

Unusual among these are the white Frogmore, one of the earliest cherries of the traditional season, or the gorgeous, orangey red, golden fleshed Napoleon.

Sour cherries still grow in old orchards — black varieties such as Morello or the Kentish red.

Merchant is an early heritage variety still grown in Kent, grafted onto the super-efficient Gisela stock.

But most of the big sellers are modern fruits, with Kordia being the favourite. Big, deep ruby red and full of sweet juice, it tastes amazing.

My only criticism is that it is too large to fit in my old-fashioned cherry stoning gadget. So these magnificent fruit have to be pitted by hand before I can make jam and puddings.

All this abundance shows British cherries have fought back to become a prominent crop.

‘As the trees mature they will yield more and more,’ says Sarah Neaves.

‘I think the most fantastic thing is how beautiful these trees are. I just love to come to work every day,’ she says.
