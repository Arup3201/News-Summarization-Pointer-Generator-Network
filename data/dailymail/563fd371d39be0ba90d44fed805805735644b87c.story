It's always wise to keep an eye on your personal belongings when you travel.

But a tourist in Kodaikanal, in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, was taken by surprise when a monkey brazenly pilfered cash right in front of him.

A video clip shot by a traveller who joined the unnamed man on a company trip over Christmas, shows the cheeky monkey playing with the man's hair, before making a grab for the cash.

Happily posing for photographs with the animal on his shoulders, the tourist had no idea the animal had designs on his wallet.

After preening the the man's hair, the light-fingered primate managed to pull a one thousand rupee note out of his pocket.

Thankfully for the victim, the thief quickly decided it wasn't that interested in money - returning it to its rightful owner.

Capuchins are some of the most intelligent monkeys in the world. 

Armed with a ferocious set of teeth and a will to bite they can also be quite intimidating.
