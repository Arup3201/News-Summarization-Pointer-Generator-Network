Football Association chairman Greg Dyke is open to the idea of a foreigner succeeding Roy Hodgson - as long as the manager in question has a deep understanding of the English game.

Dyke confirmed earlier this summer that Hodgson would remain Three Lions boss until his contract expires at the end of Euro 2016.

Dyke says the FA board has not considered whether they should extend Hodgson's deal beyond that tournament and the England manager claims he has given it little thought himself.

Roy Hodgson will be England manager until after Euro 2016, but his future beyond that is uncertain

'My four-year plan is to stay alive,' Hodgson quipped last week at a press conference at Wembley.

Should the FA decide to opt for a change after Euro 2016, which is likely given that Hodgson will be nearing his 69th birthday then, a foreign manager could be considered.

The FA was criticised for appointing Fabio Capello and Sven-Goran Eriksson before Hodgson's tenure, but Dyke is refusing to rule out going down the same road again this time around.

'They wouldn't necessarily have to be English but they certainly would have to understand English football,' Dyke told Press Association Sport at an FA grassroots event in Lowestoft.

'You wouldn't rule out someone who is a Scot or Welsh or French but they would have to understand English football.'

The mention of a Frenchman from Dyke is interesting given that Arsene Wenger was reported to have been considered as a possible candidate for the England job in the past.

Still, Dyke is not in a hurry to start considering who should take the post and when.

'We haven't thought that far ahead,' Dyke said.

Hodgson restored some faith to the nation's football fans by guiding England to an impressive 2-0 win over Switzerland in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier last month.

Hodgson's squad met for the first time since that victory on Monday as they started preparations for this week's qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia.

All 21 players, including Arsenal defender Calum Chambers, who has replaced the injured John Stones, reported for duty on Monday at St George's Park, where the squad is due to undertake a light training session.

The build-up to the double-header was overshadowed by Hodgson's decision to omit Daniel Sturridge from his squad, even though the striker was in contention to play for Liverpool against West Brom last weekend.

The former Chelsea man, who suffered a thigh injury on international duty last month, did not play against the Baggies and Hodgson is now hoping to move on from the matter.

'It's all about the fitness of a player who was injured unfortunately on England duty last time, and he hasn't recovered so he is not fit to play,' Hodgson said in an interview with Good Morning Britain.

'If he was fit to play then I would have expected him to be with us.'

Sturridge's absence means Danny Welbeck will be given another chance to lead the line after his fine brace against the Swiss.

Captain Wayne Rooney will also be eager to make an impression given that he is currently sidelined from action with Manchester United because of a three-match ban.

Rooney will join Jimmy Greaves as England's third highest goalscorer of all time if he finds the net on three more occasions over the next week.

'I hope he does (reach Greaves' landmark). I want him to score as many goals as possible,' said Hodgson of Rooney, who is eight short of Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time record.

'It's not all about goals. It's all about victories. It will be good for his confidence though. Goals are goals.'

Despite concerns about a low turn-out, it is understood that around 50,000 fans are expected to be at Thursday's match against San Marino - around 10,000 more than attended the September friendly against Norway.

England will then take on Estonia in Tallinn on Sunday.

Around 15,000 fans are expected to attend England's Under-21 play-off against Croatia at Molineux on Friday.
