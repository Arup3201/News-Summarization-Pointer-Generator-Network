No sooner had the players finished their lap of honour than the work began through the night to turn  Wembley Stadium into a venue fit for a grudge match.

They will bay for blood when Carl Froch and George Groves collide but England skipped off on their Brazilian adventure with frivolity in the air.

There were paper planes, Mexican waves and beach balls bobbing in the stands. Very few of those present expect Roy Hodgson and his team to return with the trophy, but Brazil is the home of carnival and most were ready to commit to the spirit.

We should be relieved. Thirty years ago, England fans would have been ready to perform their own tribute to the Brazilian riots.

There has been a huge change in the demographic and a change in expectations. On Friday night the crowd were unfailingly positive, and they were rewarded with goals. This is Hodgson’s Bossa Nova, his new wave.

‘Get Set Go’ said the front of the match-day programme. The England manager addressed the crowd pre-match from the big screens behind each goal. This was it. Roy and his lions, off to the jungle saddling supporters of a certain generation with a ‘Tight Fit’ tune in their heads, even if lions don’t live in the jungle.

The steamy rainforest climate, however, seemed a long way off on a cool May evening. Fans watched in hats and scarves but South America still infiltrated Wembley.

There was the samba band before kick-off and of course the Peruvians, intent on giving England a tough pre-tournament test.

England were preparing for a World Cup in Chile when they last played Peru. That was in Lima in 1962 and Jimmy Greaves scored a hat-trick in a 4-0 win.

The aim on Friday night was the same. Hodgson wanted his players to sample the rhythms of South American opponents, to tackle some of the inevitable frustrations that come with football on that continent.

Rinaldo Cruzado’s reckless assault on Steven Gerrard might not have attracted attention in the ’62 World Cup but he was rightly booked on Friday night. Gerrard climbed to his feet and shook his head, unimpressed.

It was not a warm-up-friendly sort of tackle, but it was a timely reminder that England need their captain fit and healthy for several reasons. On his 34th birthday, winning cap No 110, he is close to irreplaceable as a leader and a holding midfielder.

Here was a lesson in patience. Do not lose the plot when a team defends deep and with resolve. Do not react when on the receiving end of a hefty midfield challenge. Wayne Rooney and David Beckham have cracked in the past and seen red.

Peru broke up play, interfered with England’s tempo and threatened on the break. Hodgson looked on and rubbed his chin.

He had, by his own admission, talked a lot over the last couple of weeks. Had any of it sunk in? Maybe. Hodgson allowed himself an air-punch of delight when Daniel Sturridge curled in a left-footer from the edge of the area. Sturridge looked dangerous. Joe Hart was solid.

England took control in the last half-hour. Adam Lallana offered glimpses of the invention which has added creativity to this team. The set-pieces proved successful.

And the Italian scouts in the crowd, filmed occasionally on their phones and scribbled when England went  forward. They will be confident of defending the set-pieces better than Peru did.

And while the support was impressive, they probably will not be too in awe of anything they saw on the pitch.
