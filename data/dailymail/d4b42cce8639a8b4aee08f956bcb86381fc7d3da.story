‘Whatever decision you make you have to make it quickly,' Lt Chris Bailey of the IMPD told FOX59. 

'You never know how long its gonna take them to get from an entry point to where you are.'

Another victim, Anna Redford, said she also heard the burglars enter her apartment but pretended to remain asleep rather than disturb them.

‘I thought I was dreaming. When I first woke up I was kind of like “Is this real?” And I waited and as I woke up I was like “This is real!” There's somebody in here,’ she said.

The apartment block is located near Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis.

Redford said she stayed quietly in her room until the burglars left and then got up to discover what they had taken and also call 911.

'I looked around and I saw that my purse was gone and my laptop and so I called 911 and they came right away and my car keys were in my purse so they had also stolen my car,' she said.

Thanks to the quick-thinking resident who had texted a friend, police were already on the way thanks and were able to track down and arrest the young thieves.

As a result Redford had her car and most of the items from her purse returned to her.

 Redford, who is staying in Indiana while her husband is receiving cancer treatment said the experience had been her more thankful than ever on Thanksgiving.

'For me already it doesn't seem like Thanksgiving, because I'm not at home and I'm not with my family, but to me now I'm going to be way more thankful because I got my stuff back,' she said.
