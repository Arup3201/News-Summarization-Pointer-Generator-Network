Rioters at the U.S. Open of Surfing last month took to the streets, smashing up windows and grafitting cars.

But the perpetrators were pretty easy to find when they inadvertently outed themselves on social media.

The Huntington beach Police Department posted pictures of 25 suspects on Facebook, asking for help identifying the wanted rioters.

Gotcha: Huntington Beach Police posted this picture of Rodriguez on their Facebook page, and were quickly able to ID him when a friend tagged him and he 'liked' the image

Outed: Rodriguez's facebook friend Luis RoYce tagged him in the picture posted by the Huntington PD, and Rodriguez himself 'liked' the picture

One of the rioters, 18-year-old Luis Rodriguez, was caught when his Facebook friend tagged him in the comments section of one of the pictures and he 'liked' the image.

Now, Rodriguez is being charged with vandalism for writing 'f*** the pigs' on police squad cars.

Caught: Rodriguez also posted a picture to Facebook taken during the riots of him sitting on a cop car. He is being charged with vandalism for tagging several squad cars

And Rodriguez isn't the only one who doesn't know how to lie low.

Niko Johnson, 18, attracted the police's attention when someone started circulating a picture of a man breaking the windows at Easyrider, a bike and skateboard store, with a stop sign.

He posted on a picture that was circulating Instagram writing: 'SOMEBODY HAD TO DO IT! Led the PAC hahah'

Bragger: Niko Johnson claimed to be involved in the smashing of a local store's window and bragged about how many Instagram followers he gained after the riots

Busted: When police later interviewed Johnson they determined he wasn't the man pictured smashing the window, but still planned to bring up charges against him for other actions

He further discussed his involvement at the riots on Twitter, telling friend he was 'in ever f****** video!!!' and bragging about how many Instagram followers he gained in the aftermath.INSERT

Police spoke with Johnson late last month and planned to bring charges against him, but concluded that he was not the person pictured in the images smashing Easyrider's window.

Police have made further arrests without the help of social media.

On August 11 they arrested 20-year-old Anthony Abadier for using his skateboard to smash up newspaper stands.

An unnamed 17-year-old turned himself in the same day for damaging porta-potties and trying to tip over a public works truck.Â
