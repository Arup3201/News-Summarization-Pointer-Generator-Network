Dangerous: A bag containing a bomb was left inside the Patrick V.McNamara Federal Building, pictured, for weeks after it was found by a security guard who failed to check it and stashed it under a desk

A bag containing a bomb was left inside a U.S. government building for weeks after it was found by a security guard who failed to check it and stashed it under a desk.

The bomb was in a canvas bag which contained a small locked safe and was found outside the 27-storey Patrick V.McNamara Federal Building which houses the FBI.

But the guard misidentified the bag as found property and did not treat it as suspicious, despite not being aware of what it contained.

The bag was then placed underneath the security desk in the building and it was not considered suspicious because the space was used to store property which had been found as well as personal belongings.

Whilst underneath the desk, it was shaken by a guard and at least two employees X-rayed it to try and determine its contents.

Eventually, 21 days after it was discovered, two security guards became suspicious of the bag and screened it. They could not identify the contents and so notified a Federal Protective Services  (FPS) inspector who concluded the bag could contain an explosive.

The bomb went on to be detonated harmlessly by Detroit Police.

Details of the discovery of the bomb were released in a report by the Homeland Security Department's office of inspector general yesterday.

It concluded that the security guard had shown poor judgement as well as saying the guard's employer, a contractor, and the FDS shared some responsibility for the bomb going undetected.

According to CNN, it said: 'Although the IED (improvised explosive device) did not explode, it represented a risk to the safety and security of the building and its occupants,' the report said.

It added: 'The guard's actions were serious breaches that cannot be compared easily to other breaches by this company or other guard service companies because there is little precedent,'.

The guard was a sergeant with the Detroit Police Department and according to one official was one of the best in the building. But following the incident, the guard was fired. Another guard and a supervisor were also fired and a second supervisor resigned before being fired.

A number of others were suspended, given written warnings and retrained.

A man from Michigan went to to be charged with placing the device in the  bag outside the building.
