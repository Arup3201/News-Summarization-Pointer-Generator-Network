Crystal Palace midfielder Stuart O'Keefe has joined Championship side Cardiff City for an undisclosed fee.

The 23-year-old has signed a contract with the Bluebirds until 2017 after failing to impress new Palace manager Alan Pardew.

The central-defensive midfielder has struggled to make an impact at Selhurst Park in the Premier League, but played 51 times in his four-and-a-half years in south London.

He will be best remembered by Palace fans for playing a pivotal role in the Championship playoff final, after coming on as a substitute for the injured Kagisho Dikgacoi - now his team-mate at Cardiff.

Palace beat Watford 1-0 in extra-time, securing their place in the Premier League.

O'Keefe scored one goal in Palace colours, in the club's second home game after being promoted to the Premier League. He came on as a substitute against Sunderland, rifling home an effort from outside the 18-yard box to secure a 3-1 victory for the Eagles.

He becomes Cardiff boss Russell Slade's fourth signing of the transfer window, following on from Alex Revell, Scott Malone and Lee Peltier. 

O'Keefe is expected to make his debut for the south Wales outfit on Saturday, when Derby County are the visitors.
