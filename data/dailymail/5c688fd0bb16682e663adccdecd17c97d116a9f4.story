A group of Virginia mothers have launched a fundraising campaign for a woman left to raise three sets of twins alone after her husband died suddenly.

Dad-of-six Wayne Beale, who had a heart condition, passed away unexpectedly at the family's Fredericksburg, Virginia home on Sunday after battling bronchitis for a few days.

The tragedy means that the 45-year-old man's wife, Joni, is now left to care for their children - two two-year-old girls, an eight-year-old boy and girl, and two 13-year-old boys.

Due to Mr Beale's heart condition, the family was unable to secure life insurance for him, meaning that Mrs Beale, a homemaker, has been left with little financial support for her large brood.

But now, in just a few days, a GoFundMe page set up by fellow mothers has surpassed their aim. The total stood at more than $20,400 early on Friday.

'She
 just can't believe it,' Mrs Beale's friend Joy Moeller told NBC Washington. '"Where is 
all this coming from? Who are all these people?" She said there are 
people who have given, [she doesn't] even know who they are.'

The page was first set up by Heather Ablondi, a religion reporter for the Free Lance-Star and a mother who met Mrs Beale through a preschoolers group.

'Going 
forward, she needs to be able to pay her mortgage payment, her electric 
bill [and] buy groceries for her kids,' Ablondi said. 'Just what could we do?'

She said that they hoped to raise $6,000 to cover immediate costs for the funeral, plus anything else people were willing to give. But within 24 hours, they had already raised $10,000 on the page.

Loss: Wayne Beale, left with his wife Joni and four of their children, had a heart condition that prevented him from getting life insurance. Mr Beale, who worked in construction, passed away on Sunday

Left behind: The twins are all home schooled by their mother, who is being helped by the community

'It surprises me a little bit how quickly
 it poured in,' she said. 'I think people just want to be there for her.'

Friends said that the beloved family, who are church-goers, have never asked for anything; Wayne worked construction jobs while Joni, his wife of 20 years, home-schooled the children.

'He was a constant worker, just serving his family,' friend Michelle Nicely told the Lance-Star.

Mrs Beale, who homeschools her children, is now planning her husband's funeral.

Fellow churchgoers at Spotswood Baptist Church have volunteered to baby-sit and provide meals for the family and have watched as the GoFundMe page continues to grow.

Generosity: By early on Friday, the GoFundMe page had raised more than $20,000 for the family

'When you meet Joni, the first thing that 
you notice is her amazing smile and enthusiam for life,' the GoFundMe page explains. 'It is hard to 
believe that this beautiful, well put together woman is the mother of 
three sets of twins!

'Joni is facing an uncertain future as the sole provider for her family.

'Her most immediate needs include the funeral expenses... We would love to raise over and above that in order to provide Joni a financial cushion to rely on while she makes plans for this unexpected chapter of her life.'
