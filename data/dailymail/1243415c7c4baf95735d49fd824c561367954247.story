Circus performer Igor Zaripov has jaws so strong he can pull a bus using only his teeth.

The 30-year-old, dubbed 'Mouth of Steel', holds three world records including pulling the heaviest road vehicle by the teeth - a 12,360kg double-decker bus.

He also holds the record for the fastest time to pull a car 100ft with teeth, in 15.7 seconds. While his third record is for suspending himself by the teeth for two minutes and 32 seconds.

Incredible strength: Mr Zaripov has been nicknamed a real-life Superman

The Russian, who now lives in Las Vegas, prepares by speaking only his mother tongue on the day he performs, because he believes it makes his jaws more powerful.

He said: 'When I do my stunts, I only speak Russian. I think it makes me stronger. I feel powerful, like I can take on the world.'

Mr Zaripov works for Cirque Du Soleil
and is from a long line of circus performers, who can trace their 
performing roots back to 1893, when his great-great grandparents 
mesmerised the last Tsar with death-defying acrobatics.

He said: 'We're all here together, trying to do the same thing - trying to stay positive, trying to eat healthy, and trying to get the exercise in.

'It's not always easy but a wise person has said that 'nothing that is important is ever easy'.

'I feel this is one of my many purposes - to help others through what I have learnt and what I am continuing to learn daily.'
