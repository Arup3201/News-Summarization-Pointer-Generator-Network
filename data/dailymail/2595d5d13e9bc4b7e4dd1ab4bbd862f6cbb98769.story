A group of Nazi hunters says it has identified 76 men and four women - many of whom may still be alive - who ran mobile death squads killing thousands of Jews during the 1930s and 40s.

The Simon Wiesenthal Center claims to have identified dozens of former members of the Nazi death squads, and says it is now pushing the German government for a formal investigation.

The centre's top Nazi hunter, Efraim Zuroff, said that his research is so solid that he last month sent the German justice and interior ministries a list of 76 men and four women he has identified as having served in the so-called Einsatzgruppen, adding that he is demanding those still living face charges.

Victims: The Einsatzgruppen are known to have rounded up and shot Jews in the opening salvo of the Holocaust before the Nazi concentration camp system was properly established

The Einsatzgruppen - made up of primarily SS and police personnel - followed Nazi Germany's troops as they battled their way eastward in the early years of the war.

They are known to have rounded up and shot Jews in the opening salvo of the Holocaust before the Nazi concentration camp system was properly established.

According to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Einsatzgruppen had killed more than a million Soviet Jews, as well as tens of thousands of other people, by the spring of 1943.

'In the death camps the actual act of murder was carried out by a very small number of people - the people who put the gas into the gas chambers. But the actual act of murder in the Einsatzgruppen was carried out individually,' Zuroff said.

'Almost every person in the Einsatzgruppen was a murderer, a hands-on murderer,' he added.

Zuroff said he narrowed down the list of possible suspects by choosing the youngest from a list of some 1,100 with dates of birth known to his organization.

It is estimated that there had been about 3,000 members of the death squads.

All 80 of those on his list would now be elderly if still alive, born between 1920 and 1924, Zuroff said.

'Time is running out,' he said in a telephone interview from Jerusalem. 'Something has to be done.'

Because of Germany's strict privacy laws, the Wiesenthal Center has been unable to confirm exactly where the suspects live. But Zuroff said that task, and determining whether the individuals are still alive, should be relatively easy for police or prosecutors.

He added that his office is willing to assist in any way in coming up with evidence or other details.

'The hope is that as many as possible will be alive, but there's no guarantee obviously,' he said. 'But every person alive today is a victory of sorts.'

Germany's Interior Ministry had no immediate comment but the Justice Ministry said it had passed the details of the letter to the special federal prosecutors' office that investigates Nazi-era crimes.

The head of that office, Kurt Schrimm, told the AP he hasn't yet received the new information.

A handful of Einsatzgruppen members were tried and convicted after the war but most have gone unpunished.

Schrimm has said, however, they could now be prosecuted under new German legal theory that service in a Nazi unit whose sole purpose was murder is enough to convict someone of accessory to murder - even without evidence of participation in a specific crime as had previously been required.
