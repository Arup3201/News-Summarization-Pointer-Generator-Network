An 85-year-old woman was sexually assaulted and battered to death by a home invader who also shot her 90-year-old husband in the face with a BB gun.

Nancy and Bob Strait, who had celebrated their 65th wedding anniversary in December, were discovered by their daughter at their home in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Both the pensioners were rushed to hospital where Mrs Strait, who was nearly blind, died from her injuries.

Home invasion: Bob and Nancy Strait were both attacked when burglars broke into their home in Tulsa. Mrs Strait died of her injuries

Mr Strait, who served in the 101st Airborne 
Division in World War II, suffered a broken jaw, broken ribs and severe bleeding. He is in a serious condition in hospital.

Police have arrested 20-year-old Tyrone Dale David Woodfork in connection with the case.

The Straits' distraught family today 
paid tribute to the pair, who grew up in poverty in rural Oklahoma 
during the Great Depression.

They met each other on a blind date on Thanksgiving 1946,
 married a month later and went on to have six children, 18 
grandchildren and about 50 great and great-great grandchildren. They had
 recently welcomed a great-great-great grandchild.

Their daughters Lanora and Andra told
 Tulsa World that the couple were loving and generous people who would 
do anything for anyone.

'Dad never talked, and Mama never quit talking,' Lanora said.

'Whatever she did, it came from the heart,' Andra added.

The pair could be found sitting on their porch singing and playing the guitar during warmer summer evenings.

Mr
 Strait, who had worked for the oil derrick supply company Lee C. Moore 
before retirement, enjoyed woodwork while his wife loved making quilts 
and baking.

Suspect: Tyrone Dale David Woodfork, 20, was arrested a day after the attack on complaints of first-degree murder, burglary, assault with a dangerous weapon and two complaints of armed robbery

They
 had both been struggling with health problems before the attack. Mr 
Strait had been diagnosed with a terminal kidney illness but had 
outlived the doctor's prognosis.

'He was living because Mother was alive,' Andra told Tulsa World.

The couple had had food poisoning the week before the attack.

'There
 is no one else who has been through what he's been through who is still
 alive,' Lanora said of her father.

'We pray he doesn't remember.'

Tulsa police believe burglars broke into the Straits' home either late Tuesday or early Wednesday last week. They were not found until the Wednesday evening.

The home invaders made off with their Dodge Neon, a television and $200.

Woodfork was later found hiding in a nearby house after a witness spotted the stolen vehicle being driven down the road.

He is being held at Tulsa Jail 
without bail accused of first-degree murder, burglary, assault with a 
dangerous weapon and two counts of armed robbery.

'This
 investigation is far from over,' Officer Jason Willingham of the Tulsa 
police department told Tulsa World. 'We've still got a lot of questions 
that we still need answered.'

Mrs Strait's funeral will be on Friday. The family has set up a fund the Nancy Strait and Bob Strait Support Trust to help pay for the service and her husband's medical care.

Life together: The couple went on to have six children, 18 grandchildren and about 50 great and great-great grandchildren all after marrying a month after meeting

Attack: One of the couple's daughters discovered her parents unresponsive in their Tulsa home with their car, a television and $200 among the items missing
