American Sniper is a blockbuster hit, but that does not mean it's universally loved.

The film has become a political point of controversy between left-wing filmmakers who think the movie is propaganda and conservative politicians dedicated to deafening the memory of slain Navy SEAL Chris Kyle whose memoir inspired the film. 

The Academy Award-nominated movie stars Bradley Cooper as real-life Navy SEAL Kyle, who became the deadliest sniper in U.S. history for making more than 150 kills. He was tragically killed just a few years after leaving the military, allegedly by a fellow soldier struggling with PTSD.

Michael Moore was the first to speak out against the film on Twitter last week by calling snipers 'cowards'. He has continued to rant about both the film and the Iraq War for the past two weeks while American Sniper has set box-office records. Meanwhile, conservatives like Sarah Palin have been calling Moore out for his 'disrespect' of U.S.troops.

Critic: Michael Moore sparked controversy last week when he called snipers 'cowards' in a Twitter rant, and later said that his statements were not a criticism of the film 

While attending the Iowa Freedom Summit this weekend, the former vice presidential candidate posed with Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer, who held up a sign reading 'F*** you Michael Moore'. 

She then told the audience that 'what the poster said is what the rest of us are thinking'. 

The ex-Alaskan governor previously issued a statement about Moore's tirade, saying: 'Hollywood leftists: while caressing shiny plastic trophies you exchange among one another while spitting on the graves of freedom fighters who allow you to do what you do, just realize the rest of America knows you're not fit to shine Chris Kyle's combat boots.'

On Saturday, Moore spoke out yet again about the movie, using theology to argue that his stance on snipers was right.  

Answering the Christian mantra 'What would Jesus Do?' Moore said that he 'wouldn't put any soldiers lives in harm's way in the first place because he wouldn't have sent them to Iraq'. 

'Instead of being a sniper to protect our troops, I tried to save their lives by stopping Bush from sending them to their deaths in Iraq,' he added.

He later posted a protracted message on Facebook, arguing that he loves soldiers the most because he was an outspoken critic of the Iraq War, and never would have sent them abroad to begin with if he had the choice. 

The post also includes more than a dozen ways he has supported the military including charity work that helps get veterans jobs and treatment for PTSD as well as setting up website that offered his books and videos to soldiers for free.

Moore was also lambasted by Debbie Lee, the mother of a slain Navy SEAL, at a fundraising event attended by Kyle's widow Taya Kyle this weekend. 

The mother of Marc Alan Lee, the first Navy SEAL killed in action during Operation Iraqi Freedom, challenged Moore to go through military training. 

'It means so much to know that there are so many people out here who continue to support what we’re doing in the memory of Chris, in the memory of Marc,' Debbie Lee said. 'And I don’t know if you guys heard, but I challenged Michael Moore that all of you snipers out there will run him through training. Just one day, we won’t even make him go to combat. See if we can educate him.'

While Moore has been the target of many defenders of American Sniper, he isn't the movie's only critic. 

Bill Maher described the blockbuster as a film about a 'psychopath' killer, while Seth Rogen was forced to clarify his comments when he compared the movie to a fake Nazi propaganda short included in the Quentin Tarantino film Inglorious Basterds. 

Maher, speaking on his HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher, drew on excerpts from the autobiography Kyle wrote before he was killed in February 2013, in which he said he enjoyed war and referred to his targets as 'savages'.

He chose parts of the book, also called American Sniper, where Kyle said 'I love killing bad guys - even with the pain I loved what I was doing.'

Maher also quoted the line 'maybe war isn't really fun but I certainly was enjoying it', as well as a point at which he said 'I hate the damn savages', in reference to the at least 160 people he shot dead in his time as a Navy SEAL.

The film, directed by Clint Eastwood, was then compared with Hurt Locker, another film centered on the Iraq war which made far less money, though won widespread praise.

Maher said: 'Hurt Locker' made $17million because it was a little ambiguous and thoughtful... [American Sniper] is just "American hero! He's a psychopath patriot, and we love him."' 

Rogen, on the other hand, stated in a Twitter post that American Sniper reminded him of a movie included in Inglorious Basters about a Nazi sniper.  He later said that he did not mean to criticize American Sniper, and that his tweet was just a comment about how the two have a similar focus.

The controversies do not appear to have harmed the fortunes of the film, which brought in $107million on its first weekend and has earned six Academy Awards nominations.
