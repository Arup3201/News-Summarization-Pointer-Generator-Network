Ever since Marijuana became legal in Colorado on January 1, pot-infused goodies have been flying high off the shelves.

Many shops selling edibles have been unable to keep their cookies, sodas, and candies in stock after Colorado became the only US state to legalize sale of marijuana for recreational use as oppose to medicinal use only.

The Denver Channel reports that there is such a demand for edibles that stores like LoDo Wellness in Denver have had to limit customers to only two edible products a day.

LoDo Wellness said that if they don't ration their products they will run out of stock.

The new supply of edibles that LoDo got last week was sold in only one hour hour.

'Edibles have been really huge with the recreational market,' Linda Andrews, owner of LoDo Wellness Center in Denver, told ABC News.

'They're great if you're not a [marijuana] connoisseur and you want something more palatable,' she said.

The most popular treats are marijuana infused chocolate bars for $15 and chocolate Dixie rolls that cost $17 per pack.

Andrews also pointed out that edibles are more discrete than smoking marijuana.

Andrews told ABC News that sales went up 300 per cent after selling marijuana for recreational use became legal. She previously only sold items to patients prescribed marijuana for medicinal use.

One Marijuana manufacturer called Dixie Elixirs and Edibles is building a new 30,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in order to keep up with demand.

'Demand's been huge,' Chief Marketing officer of Dixie Elixirs Joe Hodas told ABC News.

'And our employees have been just killing it working 'round the clock.'

Dixie creates marijuana infused chocolates, lotion, and soda drinks that come in different flavors.

Hodas told The Denver Channel that the recreational marijuana market creates entirely new jobs.

'We're looking at upwards of 10,000 new jobs being created over the next few years,' said Hodas.

Since marijuana stores can't use traditional messengers to deliver their services, there is a new collection of delivery services made for the sole purpose of delivering weed.

'We can't use traditional couriers to deliver our products,' said Hodas.

'Obviously we can't use mail.'

Experts predict they will sell $2.3 billion in marijuana sales this year and $10 billion by the year 2019.

Brook Gherig, owner of a weed company called Patients Choice told Time.com that predicting how much weed to order based on supply and demand has been difficult to calculate since the legal market is so new.

'We’re making businesses decisions,” she says, “based on a total unknown.'

Twenty states and Washington D.C. allow medical marijuana sales. So far Colorado is the only state to sell the drug recreationally but Washington will alow the sale later this year.
