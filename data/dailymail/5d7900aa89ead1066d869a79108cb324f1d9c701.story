American sprinter Justin Gatlin finished the season undefeated in all of his 18 races with a 9.83 seconds 100 metre win at the IAAF world challenge meeting in Rieti on Sunday.

'My season ends now. I need to rest,' Gatlin said. 'The crowd gave me a lot of energy.'

In the other of two finals at the event, Jamaican Asafa Powell, who is returning from a doping ban, claimed victory in 9.90 seconds.

Good company: Gatlin is the first sprinter since Usain Bolt in 2009 to go through a season unbeaten

It was in the same Italian city in 2007 that Powell set a then world record of 9.74 seconds.

Gatlin backed up his sprint double victory at the Diamond League finals in Brussels on Friday, which took his tally to 16 races for the season.

There he set a personal and season's best time in the 100m and smashed his rivals in the 200m an hour later. 

His win on Sunday makes Gatlin the first male sprinter to go through an entire season unbeaten since Usain Bolt in 2009, taking full advantage of the Olympic and world champion's exceptionally lean season.
