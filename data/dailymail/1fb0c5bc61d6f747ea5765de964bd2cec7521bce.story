Wayne Rooney's brother was banned from the road today after being caught driving three times over the alcohol limit to buy booze for a party.

The Manchester United striker's younger sibling Graham was found guilty of drink driving but blamed his friends.

Dressed in a Team GB hoodie, the 24-year-old left Liverpool Magistrates' Court with friends after being handed a two-year driving ban, 150 hours community service and told to pay £650 costs.

Community service: Graham Rooney, 24, leaves Liverpool Magistrates Court with a large group of friends after being sentenced for drink driving

Guilty: Rooney, just seen, leaves court with friends after receiving a two-year suspended driving ban and 150 hours community service and being told to pay £650 costs

He was arrested at his parents' luxury £450,000 house in Liverpool in April.

Graham - who has a striking resemblance to his £180,000-a-week superstar brother, 26 - was held in custody for more than 14 hours.

The court heard there had been a party at the house he shares with parents Wayne Senior and Jeanette.

When the alcohol ran out there was a dispute over who should go to buy more, according to Rooney's solicitor Richard Derby.

The lawyer claimed the East Villa player told his guests: 'I pay for everything, you're in my house so why don't you go and get it.'

He was arrested after officers spotted a black Audi A3 driving erratically into the grounds of the property.

Rooney was seen stumbling into the house and his manner alarmed the officers, who were concerned he was unfit to drive.

The court heard he became 'instantly aggressive', threatening to sue the police for trespassing and have them arrested.

A breath test found him to have 128mg per 100mg of alcohol in his system - more than three times the limit of 35mg.

The 24-year-old, who plays in the Liverpool County Premier League, was questioned and charged 14 hours later.

As he walked into the court in the 
city centre today, Rooney, wearing a Team GB grey and blue tracksuit top
and dark grey combats, was flanked by two friends.

He sat in the dock with his head down and fiddled with a tissue as the hearing proceeded.

He had claimed at trial in June he was not behind the wheel.

Prosecution counsel Mr Michael Caine 
told the court: 'Mr Rooney was somewhat agitated at the police station 
and it was clear he was drunk.

'After he sobered up he appeared to co-operate with police.'

Rooney's solicitor Mr Derby pleaded 
for leniency on banning him from driving for the maximum term 'because 
he was a young lad who like to pick up girlfriends.'

But that was dismissed by District 
Judge Miriam Shelvey, who disqualified him from driving for two years 
and ordered 150 hours unpaid community service with £650 costs.

She told Rooney: 'Anyone who drives with such a high level of alcohol is a danger to other people.'

Graham and Wayne Rooney are known to be close and regularly spend nights out together.

They, along with their third brother John, 21, grew up together as Everton fans and all three played for the youth team.

But
while Wayne went on to sign for the club they supported, followed by 
Manchester United and England, Graham did not make it as a professional.
