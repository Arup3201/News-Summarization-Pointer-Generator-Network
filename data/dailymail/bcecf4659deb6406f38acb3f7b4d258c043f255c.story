It may come across as an extreme case of nuptial nostalgia: A now-divorced man saying a photography studio should pay to recreate his wedding to make up for what he considers flawed pictures and video.

Never mind that the New Yorker's ex-wife has moved to her native Latvia and has so far proved uncontactable.

Brushing that aside as well as being branded a 'groomzilla' Todd Remis has spoken out for the first time about his now notorious lawsuit.

Disgruntled: Todd Remis with his Latvian bride Milena Grzibovska in one of the images taken by the photographer during the wedding. He claims the pictures and video were botched

His comments released today are his first public response to a flurry of mocking commentary on the case

He said it was about holding a business to a pledge, not holding onto a broken marriage. It was his first public response to a flurry of acidic commentary on the case in recent months.

'It was their failure to deliver 
after a promise and a handshake' agreement to retouch the photos, Remis 
said in a statement. 'How could a business treat a customer this way?'

While lawsuits over wedding 
photographs aren't unusual, what set Remis' case apart is his mention of
wanting to reconstitute the ceremony and celebration of a bygone union.
He said during sworn questioning in 2011 that the two began divorce
proceedings in 2008.

The split was final in 2010, and he said he believed his ex-wife had moved back to her native Latvia.

Nonetheless, 'I need to have the 
wedding recreated exactly as it was so that the remaining 15 per cent of
the wedding that was not shot can be shot' and the album and video 
completed 'so we have memories of the wedding,' he said during his 
deposition. 'So we would need to recreate everything to complete that.'

And he has demanded in court papers 
that the firm repay him the $4,100 cost of the wedding photos and that 
he is awarded $48,000 to allow him to re-enact the day and fly in guests
to New York.

Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Doris Ling-Cohan invoked 
lyrics from Barbara Streisand hit 'The Way We Were' in an earlier ruling. 'This is a case in which it appears 
that the "misty watercolor memories" and the "scattered pictures of the 
smiles ... left behind" at the wedding were more important than the real
thing,' she wrote

The photographic studio has pointed 
out however that the bride is now in Latvia and un-contactable. In a 
blunt statement, studio co-founder Harold Gillet wrote a letter to the 
court stating: 'The divorce renders the further demands for photos, 
etc., ridiculous.'

After Remis's remarks about 
recreating the wedding appeared in a story in The New York Times in 
November, Remis' quest became a punchline in quarters ranging from the 
legal blogosphere to the city's tabloids. The Daily News gave him a 'New
York Knucklehead Award'; CNN's Anderson Cooper included Remis on his 
'RidicuList'.

He began sueing H&H Photographers
in 2009, saying the venerable suburban New York studio had done a 
shoddy job of shooting his and Milena Grzibovska's December 2003 wedding
at a century-old hotel overlooking the Hudson River.

Remis, 44, who has worked as a stock 
analyst, says the photographer ignored the couple's request not to shoot
in front of a mirror that ended up reflecting photographers' lights, 
and the photographer and videographer left 45 minutes before the end of 
the reception, missing the last dance and the bouquet toss.

Broken marriage: The couple married in front of 40 guests at Castle on the Hudson in Tarrytown, Westchester, but separated in 2008

Stunning: The Castle on the Hudson where Remis married. He wants his 2003 wedding re-staged at the upmarket venue and that the photographers from the day to foot the bill.

Grzibovska, who is in her early 30s, 
had come to New York in June 2002 from the University of Iceland to 
study how to teach English to foreign-language speakers, according to a 
piece that September in a Columbia University newspaper.

The couple had paid a $3,500 advance 
toward a $4,100 total price for the photos, part of a wedding he said 
cost $48,000 in all, including guests' travel.

Still, Remis and his bride 'were newly married and in love' and not looking for a fight with photographers, his statement says.

H&H co-owner Daniel Fried says he
stands by the quality of the two hours of video and the hundreds of 
color and black-and-white photos, which were shot on film.

Photo company founder Curt Fried, who sold his half of the business to his son Dan, right, says Mr Remis doesn't even know where his wife lives now

'I think the photography is lovely,' 
said Fried. But he said he offered in 2004 to adjust the photos and 
upgrade the wedding album, telling Remis the two needed first to pick 
out which pictures they wanted.

'Obviously, I couldn't turn back the clock,' Fried said.

He says Remis never got back to 
H&H until he wrote in 2009 to demand a refund and interest - about 
$5,750 in all - and the completed photos and video.

No contact information could be found for Grzibovska.

The idea of a wedding-photos dispute 
that outlasted the marriage has been met with raised eyebrows by 
Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Doris Ling-Cohan, who invoked 
lyrics from the Barbara Streisand hit 'The Way We Were' in a ruling last
year that threw out some legal claims but let others go forward.

'This is a case in which it appears 
that the "misty watercolor memories" and the "scattered pictures of the 
smiles ... left behind" at the wedding were more important than the real
thing,' she wrote.

And H&H co-founder Harold Gillet 
put it more bluntly in an August 2010 letter to the court: 'The divorce 
renders the further demands for photos, etc., ridiculous.'

Both sides have suggested they might be open to a settlement, but the case continues for now.
