In the months before his recent death, the world's greatest gun-maker Mikhail Kalashnikov suffered 'unbearable' pain over the lost lives caused by his weapons, an extraordinary new letter reveals.  

He sought urgent spiritual guidance from Russia's top churchman on whether he was guilty in the eyes of God, according to his emotional appeal to the Orthodox Patriarch.

Kalashnikov died in December aged 93, but the letter penned eight  months earlier from the inventor of the AK-47 showed a startlingly different attitude than his usual practice of blaming politicians for the wars in which his guns were used. 

Deadly icon: Mikhail Kalashnikov with the weapon that made his fortune - and won him praise and condemnation. There is one AK-47 for every 70 people in the world, the deadliest weapon ever created

'The pain in my soul is unbearable, and there is one matter I cannot resolve,' he admitted in his personal missive to Patriarch Kirill. 

'If my machine gun has taken lives of people, does it mean that it is me, Mikhail Kalashnikov, aged 93, the son of a peasant, an Orthodox Christian, who is guilty of the deaths of people, even if they are enemies?'

Yet earlier in his life he was almost flippant when asked about whether he could sleep at night knowing that his 100 million guns had caused the deaths of untold numbers.

'I am often asked, 'how do you sleep knowing how many people were killed from your machine gun?', he said.   

'I always say back 'I sleep very well, thank you'.  

'It should be politicians who start wars that suffer from sleeping problems. My machine gun was made for defence.  

'If it wasn't for war, I would have been making agricultural machinery - so it was Germans who forced me to invent it. '

Soviet hero: Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1949, two years after the weapon he invented went into mass production

However, in 2008 he admitted: 'It is painful for me to see when criminal elements of all kinds fire my weapon.'

In
 his April letter, he wrote: 'The longer I live, the more this question 
drills itself into my brain. And the more I wonder why the Lord allowed 
man to have the devilish desires of envy, greed and aggression.' He signs it 'a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov'.

His
 first gun designs came after he saw Red Army soldiers in World War Two 
bemoan their inadequate weapons. His inventions were both lethal and 
simple.  

He became a 
Soviet hero and received countless Communist honours.  But by the age of
 91 he was baptised and had evidently discovered a religious faith in 
his twilight years.

'The Lord showed me the way in the afternoon of my life,' wrote the former Communist rifle inventor.

'When at the age of 91 I cross the threshold of a church, my soul felt as if it had been there before.'

The
 Russian Patriarch's press secretary, Cyril Alexander Volkov, said the 
leading churchman had received Kalashnikov's letter and replied. 

'The
 Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the 
Fatherland, the Church supports both their creators and the soldiers who
 use them,' said Volkov.

'He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia.'

Kalashnikov's
 daughter Elena admitted the letter was genuine but questioned whether 
it had been written with the assistance of a priest.  

'I have been in charge of his letters in the recent years but I did not take part in this one,' she said.  

She
 said her father had 'never spoken about his feelings' concerning 
religion and he had declined to cross himself when she gave him a small 
cross to wear around his neck.  

'He said: 'No I just can't, my arm won't do it'.  So he just used to touch his heart with a hand instead,' she revealed.
