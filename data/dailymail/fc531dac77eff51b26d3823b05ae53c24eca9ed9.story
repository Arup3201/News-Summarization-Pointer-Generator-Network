Mark Wright may have claimed that his fiancée doesn't diet and loves to eat Magnum ice-creams in bed - but judging by Michelle Keegan super-svelte appearance in her new fashion campaign, we're not quite sure we believe him.

The soap star turned fashion designer has unveiled her second collection for Lipsy and she looks incredible - as always - in the campaign imagery.

After the success of her first range for the high street chain, Michelle couldn't wait to get started on her next line.

Red hot! Michelle Keegan has unveiled her second collection for high-street chain Lipsy and says she's taken inspiration from the season's hottest colours and trends to create a 20-piece range of party wear (dress, £65)

'This collection is a bit more wintry,' she told MailOnline. 'There's lots of lovely coats, fur jackets and sexy LBDs, which will be perfect for your Christmas parties.'  

When Michelle's debut range for Lipsy went  on sale in early July, the hashtag #lipsylovemichelle became the number one trending topic on Twitter in the UK and remained in the top ten until the end of the day. 

So how does it feel? 'The response has been incredible and I am so happy that everyone loves it as much as I do,' she said.

'It's the weirdest feeling in the world seeing other people wearing my designs. A girl walked passed me wearing one of my dresses and I said "Hi" to her because I thought I knew her!' 

Perfect for date night: Michelle cites this dress as one of her favourite designs in her new range and says she recently wore it out for dinner with her fiancée Mark Wright because it was so flattering (dress, £65)

Budding designer: Michelle says she has learnt to go with her intuition a lot more the second time around and has only included pieces she would love to wear herself like this £65 blue dress, which she says is really 'different' 

In the nude: The 27-year-old actress says this range isn't as 'daring' as her first collection but has still been designed with confident, fun-loving girls in mind (dress, £60)

Lady in red: The star created mood boards when working on her range and noted that red was the hottest colour of the season so included lots of vibrant and bold red jumpsuits and dresses (jumpsuit, £70)

The 20-piece piece range, which lands online today at Lipsy.co.uk, as well as at ASOS.com, Very.co.uk, and in House of Fraser, Debenhams and Bank, aims to reflect the season’s hottest shapes, fabrics and styles that incorporate both the AW14 catwalk trends and Michelle’s coveted wardrobe. 

Speaking about her design experience, she said: 'I learnt a lot from my first time around and this time, I have gone with my instinct a lot more. I've made sure that every piece is something that I love and that I would wear myself.

'I was inspired by the catwalk but also the things I love to wear. A lot of the pieces are perfect for creating the layered look and there's lots of blazers that can be teamed with shorts, which you'll often find me wearing.

'I love the cami tops and I will be pairing them with a statement necklace,' she added. 

It's time to party! Michelle says that her latest drop is perfect for Christmas party season and reflects her 'classic' signature style (jumpsuit, £75)

Casual and cool: As well as party dresses, Michelle has included some cool kimonos, leather trousers and classic white and black camisoles (kimono, £45) 

Michelle says that this range isn't 'as daring' as her first offering and explains that she's included some red pieces because it's the hottest colour of the season. 

Describing the typical 'Lipsy girl', Michelle says they're 'confident, fun-loving, girls who like to have a good time.'

Describing her own personal style, Michelle said: 'My style is quite classic. I like block colours, I don't like a lot of fuss, I'm feminine and I really like the tailored look.'  

After setting sight on these images, it's perhaps unsurprising that the 27-year-old has topped the best celebrity body poll for the second time running.

The former Coronation Street star, who is engaged to Mark Wright, beat off stiff competition from the likes of Rihanna, Beyonce, Kim Kardashian and Chloe Sims to take the top spot. 

Despite her enviable figure, you won't find Michelle Keegan breaking a sweat in the gym or starving herself on a juice diet.

Speaking about her summer health regime, the former Coronation Street star told MailOnline: 'I haven't had any time for exercise, I'm gutted. I feel so much better when I do work out.

'I don't believe in crash diets or detoxes, I can't live like that. If I have a bad day then I'll have a good day the next.'

How will you wear yours? Michelle loves her classic camisoles and says she will be wearing hers with statement jewellery come Autumn

Infamous image: When Michelle posted this selfie, right, it went viral. Her top tips for pulling off the look? Don't be too serious with it and look like you're having a good time

The star revealed that she tries to fit in 40-minute workouts but 'doesn't like the gym'.  

The actress recently caused a stir when she uploaded an Instagram selfie of her 'enjoying a quiet night in' with her enviable abs on full display.

'I take the odd selfie,' she said. 'My top tips for perfecting the look are: don't be too serious with it, if you look like you're having a good time, it comes across in your picture.'

Suits you! Michelle was interviewed for a behind-the-scenes video by Danielle Peazer - the dancer ex-girlfriend of Liam Payne - both wearing Michelle's new designs
