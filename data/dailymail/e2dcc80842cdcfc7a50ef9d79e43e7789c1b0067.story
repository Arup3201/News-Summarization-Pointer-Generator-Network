Walmart heiress Paige Laurie Dubbert is divorcing her husband of nearly six years citing irreconcilable differences.

As well as launching divorce proceedings against high school sweetheart Patrick 'Bo' Dubbert, the unhappy heiress has also filed a civil lawsuit, reports TMZ.

In the civil suit she accuses her husband of stealing thousands of dollars from a business – a Malibu retail center - that they had operated.

Heiress to a sizable chunk of Walmart fortune Paige Laurie Dubbert is divorcing her husband of nearly six years, Patrick 'Bo' Dubbert citing irreconcilable differences

Paige and Bo, right, dated during their senior year of high school and married at a top-secret wedding in Columbia, Missouri, in June 2008

The lawsuit alleges that Bo convinced Paige to let him hire a friend as co-manager, then the two men made themselves general contractors and upped their salaries to $70,000 a month.

She also alleges that her husband also paid himself $250,000 a year to manage the project on top of the other fees.

The couple married at a top-secret wedding in Columbia, Missouri, in June 2008. They signed a prenup which not only protected her fortune, but also provided her husband with the right to spousal support if they ever divorced.

Paige isn't contesting that amount that she agreed to pay, reports TMZ and plans to change her name back to Elizabeth Paige Laurie.

Nancy and her sister Ann Walton Kroenke between them own a stake in the retail behemoth worth over $6 billion.

Mother and daughter caused controversy in 2004 when they made a $25 million naming rights gift towards the building of a new $75 million basketball arena at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri.

Nancy and her husband Bill Lawrie decided to name the facility Paige Sports Arena after their daughter.

Neither 
parents nor daughter had ever attended the university, instead Paige 
graduated that year from the University of Southern California.

A former roommate told ABC’s 20/20 that she had been paid $20,000 over four years to do Paige's homework for her.

Once the allegations emerged, Paige’s parents agreed to let the school rename the arena which is now known as Mizzou Arena. In 2005 Paige voluntarily surrendered her USC communication degree.

Paige and Bo first met back in high school during an ACT prep course and dated briefly during their senior year of high school.

Four years later they bumped into each other at an L.A. nightclub and rekindled their romance. Bo proposed to Paige in December 2006.

In 2005 Paige returned her USC communication degree after a roommate told 20/20 that she'd been paid $20,000 to write the heiress' college papers
