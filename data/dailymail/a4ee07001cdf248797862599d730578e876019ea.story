Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard heaped praise on debutant striker Mario Balotelli, insisting he could fire the club to the title this season.

The mercurial striker played an hour up front for Liverpool, linking up well with fellow striker Daniel Sturridge during the comprehensive 3-0 victory over Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Sunday.

The Italian didn’t find the net for Liverpool, missing a few decent chances, but Gerrard was delighted with his new colleague’s efforts:

‘I thought he was terrific today. All eyes were on him today, people were wondering whether he’ll work hard for us, whether he would hold the ball up for us. But for an hour he was terrific today.

‘If he plays like that for us all season then he could be the difference for whether we compete for the title.

‘I’ve only worked with him for a week but he’s has been terrific since he came in. He works hard and he will only improve with a manger like Brendan Rodgers.’

Similarly Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was pleased with Balotelli’s impact:

‘I though he was excellent with his stature upfront. He had moments of real quality’ said Rodgers.

‘But today is about the team. Mario was part of that for his hour and was excellent.’

Rodgers has now managed 56 wins from his first 100 Liverpool matches, the same amount as legendary boss Bill Shankly and Rafa Benitez.

After the 3-0 win at White Hart Lane, Rodgers was evidently pleased with the all-round performance:

‘I think everything that could have been good was there. We defended strong and played out diamond so well for 60 minutes.

‘We were a constant threat in between the lines and the two boys up top were excellent. The quality of the goals was excellent and we could have had more.

‘The defending was resolute and we managed to minimise Tottenham’s chances on goal.’

The Liverpool boss was particularly pleased with the clean sheet on Sunday: ‘It’s something I highlighted to the boys in pre-season, talking about concentration,’ added Rodgers.

‘Two wins out of three is a good start for us. We got punished at City at crucial moments but today we played so well.’
