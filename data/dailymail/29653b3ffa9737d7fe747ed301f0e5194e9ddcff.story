On Saturday night they could be crowned the best team on the planet if they win the FIFA Club World Cup against San Lorenzo, but next month Real Madrid could establish themselves as one of the greatest sides ever by breaking the world record for consecutive wins.

When they beat Ludogorets 4-0 in their last Champions League group game they made it 19 successive wins and that gave them the best record of any Spanish team ever, beating the 18-match run of Frank Rijkaard's Barcelona side in the 2005-06 season. But now the challenge is to match the Ajax team that won 26 straight games in the 1971-72 campaign.

To manage that they will first have to beat San Lorenzo on Saturday, Valencia at the Mestalla in their first league game back after the winter break, and then Atletico Madrid in the Copa del Rey in January at the Vicente Calderon. This will draw them level with Brazilian side Curitiba, who won 24 games on the bounce in 2011.

Goals (inside box): 70

Goals (penalties): 8

Conceded: 10 

Then, if they were to beat Espanyol and Getafe, they would then draw level with Ajax, and a win over Atletico in the second leg of their Cup last-16 match would give them the new world record.

The incredible run has been made all the more impressive by the fact that it followed consecutive defeats to Real Sociedad and Atletico earlier in the season. There were doubts over whether the new signings were fitting in, and whether the side could cope with the loss of Angel di Maria and Xabi Alonso.

Carlo Ancelotti's assistant Paul Clement recalls: 'We had a difficult game against Real Sociedad. We were really coasting in the first half and could have been 5-0 up and ended up losing 4-2. Then we followed that up with a defeat by Atletico Madrid. It was a difficult time and we really hadn't got up to speed quickly enough.

'I think it was a combination of some change in personnel and a difficult pre-season coming off the back of a World Cup on an American tour where we only had 10 senior players. But you can look at the form from then on, and see that we have really put things right since.'

The first win of the run came on September 16 at home in the Champions League when Basle were on the wrong end of a 5-1 hammering. Madrid then put eight past Deportivo la Coruna and five more past Elche. Suddenly they were averaging six goals a game and it wasn't all easy home wins against intimidated opposition either.

They went to Villarreal and won 2-0 and they then travelled to Bulgaria and saw off Ludogorets 2-1. Then came the real test - Liverpool home and away and Barcelona in the space of just two weeks. They made it look easy.

'Going to Anfield is always difficult because of that atmosphere,' says Clement. 'It's like another player for them. But we did really well after a difficult first 20 minutes. We got the goal and calmed the crowd.'

Real ran-out 3-0 winners and former Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo was even applauded off by the Kop when substituted.

Barcelona turned up at the Bernabeu in the next game and were still yet to concede a goal. They scored first with debutant Luis Suarez setting up Neymar. But Real were too strong and eventually ran out 3-1 winners.

After victories over Cornella and Granada, Liverpool visited Madrid with a drastically changed team from the first leg. Brendan Rodgers' personnel and tactics were different but the result was just the same with Real winning 1-0.

With three mighty scalps under their belts the Madrid steamroller has gone on flattening everyone put in its path since. On their 21-game run, they have scored 79 goals. Nine of those have come from outside the box, eight have been from the penalty spot and 15 have been headers.

They have also passed teams into submission with a total of 12,128  - while their share of possession has only dropped below 50 per cent four times, against Rayo Vallecano, Barcelona, Villarreal and Celta. And while Ronaldo and company have been running wild at one end, the defence has held firm at the other, with only 10 goals conceded.

It will not be easy to take the world record. San Lorenzo will provide tough opposition on Saturday and having to play Valencia once and Atletico Madrid twice at the turn of the year is not ideal.

But, on the evidence of the last four months, it is clear that nothing is beyond this team.
