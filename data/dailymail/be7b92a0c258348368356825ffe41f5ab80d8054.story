A widow has been left more than £4,000 out of pocket after she says that workmen vanished halfway through revamping her garden.

Joyce Watt, 74, paid the builders to redesign her garden and the driveway of her home in Aberdeen.

But she was left distraught when the Oakstone Driveways workers failed to return and finish off the job.

She claims she had initially agreed to pay 3,000 pounds for the work but the builders began asking for more cash.

And the pensioner said she now hasn't seen them for two weeks.

Joyce, of Aberdeen's Foresterhill area, said: 'I can't believe it. It is horrible, I sit here all day and cry.

'It is taking over my life - it's such a burden.

Joyce was pleased when she secured Oakstone Driveways to build her dream drive for an agreed price of 3,000 pounds - but it's not finished

No response: Two phone numbers listed on Oakstone Driveway's website are no longer in use

'I'm struggling for money now - I don't know how I'm going to live. And it's nothing like what I asked for.'

Mum-of-one
 Joyce secured planning permission for the work from Aberdeen City 
Council before looking for a firm to take on the work.

Joyce: 'I can't believe it. It is horrible, I sit here all day and cry. It is taking over my life - it's such a burden'

The firm started the work as planned but began to ask for extra cash.

Joyce agreed to pay the money, fearing the work would be delayed if she didn't, and claims she ended up paying 4,170 pounds.

But with only part of the work completed she says that they left and haven't been seen since.

Part of the work has been completed - but there appears to be no sign of the workmen

Joyce today claimed the workmen failed to complete paving in her garden, as well as creating steps from her house to her drive, building a wall instead of a fence and gates to her drive.

She added: 'It was supposed to be 3,000 pounds and no more.

'I went along with it because they had everything at the tip of their tongue.

'They even took my son round to a house and said they had done the driveway.

'I asked for receipts and they said if they had to go back to the office to get bits of paper we would never get the job finished - so I said if no more money changed hands, okay.'

After realising the workmen were not coming back, Joyce reported the firm to Trading Standards.

She said: 'I don't want anyone else to go through what I have gone through.'

Oakstone Driveways did not return calls from MailOnline.
