A shift in strategy during the Sydney Lindt cafe siege has reportedly caused tension among police as some officers believe a late decision to change tactics put hostages in greater danger.

Police who were on the front line of the siege in Martin Place on December 15 are understood to be angry about the command strategy put in place when they stormed the cafe after a 16-hour stand-off with gunman Man Horan Monis, Fairfax Media reports. 

It follows revelations hostage Katrina Dawson was shot by a police bullet during the dramatic shootout. Cafe owner Tori Johnson was executed by the gunman.

Police who were on the front line of the Sydney Lindt cafe siege on December 15 are understood to be angry about the command strategy put in place when they stormed the cafe after a 16-hour standoff

Police had drawn up a direct action plan as the siege stretched into the night, which would see them storm the cafe and take the gunman by surprise instead of waiting for him to act.

While police had considered implementing this direct action plan, which is high risk and likely to result in some casualties, the strategy was overruled when the gunman fired his first shot at 2.03am after six hostages escaped.

Police instead opted for a reactive emergency action strategy after the gunman shot dead cafe manager Mr Johnson forcing them to storm the cafe in a hail of gunfire.

Among the shots fired by police, two ricocheted and killed Ms Dawson, a 37-year-old mother of three, according to Fairfax Media. 

There is reportedly now tension among some officers who are angry the direct action strategy did not go ahead.  

The direct action plan, which is normally a last resort, was reportedly ready several hours before police stormed the cafe. 

Police have to assess all the intelligence they have and weigh up the risks of implementing a direct action strategy. After six hostages escaped at 2.03am, police would have had to speak with the victims to find out the latest details from inside the cafe, 

NSW Police would not comment. It is conducting an independent investigation into the incident.

It emerged at the weekend that Ms Dawson was struck by a police bullet as a police investigation also revealed the gunman had enough ammunition to kill all of the hostages, news.com.au reports. 

Ms Dawson, 38, was not directly hit by a bullet but possibly a ricochet when officers raided the cafe.

From initial lines of inquiry, it is believed Ms Dawson was struck in the heart by a ricocheting bullet while on the floor and again in her shoulder.

The siege's second victim, Tori Johnson, was shot in the head from behind - at close range - by Monis before officers raided the cafe.

The circumstances surrounding the 16-hour Martin Place siege is still the subject of a critical incident investigation by the homicide squad.

Ms Dawson's cause of death will be determined by the NSW Coroner once that investigation is completed.

Ms Dawson and Mr Johnson were both held hostage by Man Haron Monis at Sydney's Lindt cafe

Hostages were forced to hold Islamic flags in the windows of the cafe for hours on end

Police also would not confirm if bullets had been found in Monis' pocket following the end of the siege.

The details of the final moments of the Sydney siege emerge days after it was revealed the gunman  was dropped from the national watch lists on the same year he was reported to federal police for repeatedly threatening an Islamic school principal.

As more information comes to light about Monis’ violent and disturbing past, people continue to question why the man with a history of threatening behaviour was not being more closely monitored by authorities.

It is alleged Monis repeatedly made threats to the principal of a South Sydney school, accusing him of being a traitor and a 'sell-out' for allowing the school to engage in interfaith activities, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

After sending about 12 abusive faxes, ranting about the school’s choice to associate with a Jewish school and for holding an inter-faith Anzac Day ceremony, Monis' messages became more sinister.

'People like you will get what's coming your way,' he wrote to Osman Karolia, who was the then-principal of Arkana College in Kingsgrove.

Mr Karolia became concerned and asked if that was intended as a threat, to which Monis replied ‘yes’.

Mr Karolia contacted Australian Federal Police, deeply concerned Monis was acting in a hostile manner towards himself and the school.

Although Monis was investigated, police still elected to stop monitoring Monis by removing him from watch lists that same year.
