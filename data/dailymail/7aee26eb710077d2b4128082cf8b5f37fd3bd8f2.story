HSBC is having to weather yet more controversy after the United States named it as one of the banks it's investigating over the possible manipulation of precious metals markets.

The British banking giant is already mired in a scandal surrounding allegations that it helped wealthy clients dodge taxes and was fined last year for manipulating foreign currency markets.

Now it is being probed over the fixing of gold, silver, platinum and palladium prices.

HSBC is having to weather yet more controversy after the United States named it as one of the banks it's investigating over the possible manipulation of precious metals markets

The banks probed by the US government over possible manipulation of precious metals markets also include  Bank of Nova Scotia, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Societe Generale, Standard Bank and UBS

Barclays, previously fined for the attempted manipulation of the Libor financial benchmark, is also being probed.

The investigation is being carried out by the Justice Department with help from Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates raw materials and derivatives 

The Bank of Nova Scotia, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Societe Generale, Standard Bank and UBS are also under the spotlight, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The probes are at the preliminary stage, but HSBC, in releasing yearly results Monday, noted requests from the Justice Department and the CFTC over the precious metals probe, the Journal said.

A trove of leaked documents shows that HSBC's Swiss private bank turned a blind eye to illegal activities of arms dealers and blood diamond traders while helping rich people evade taxes, according to a report based on the documents that was published earlier this month.

The data relate to accounts worth £650billion held by more than 100,000 people and legal entities around the world.

What happened 

A former HSBC employee-turned-whistleblower, Herve Falciani, gave the data to French tax authorities in 2008. France shared it with other governments and launched investigations.

The French newspaper Le Monde obtained a version of the data and shared the material with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which analyzed the material together with The Guardian and the BBC.

What the files show 

The leaked documents mainly cover the years 2005 to 2007.

HSBC, which is based in London but has operations globally, served those close to the regimes of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, former Tunisian leader Ben Ali and Syria's Bashar Assad.

The consortium said clients include former and current politicians from Britain, Russia, Ukraine, Kenya, India, Mexico, Lebanon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zimbabwe, and Algeria.

Switzerland had the greatest number of clients of the data examined, followed by France, the United Kingdom, Brazil and Italy. In terms of ranking by value, Switzerland was first with $31.2 billion, followed by the United Kingdom with $21.7 billion; Venezuela with $14.8 billion; the U.S. with $13.4 billion; and France with $12.5 billion. 

Why it matters 

Though some of the details of such operations were disclosed previously, when HSBC was fined in 2012 by the U.S. for allowing criminals to use its branches for money laundering, the new information suggests HSBC took an active role in assisting the wealthy in hiding their money from authorities.

'The bank repeatedly reassured clients that it would not disclose details of accounts to national authorities, even if evidence suggested that the accounts were undeclared to tax authorities in the client's home country,' the consortium said. 'Bank employees also discussed with clients a range of measures that would ultimately allow clients to avoid paying taxes in their home countries.'

Crawford Spence, a professor of accounting at the University of Warwick, said this case was different than other recent tax scandals.

'HSBC has been complicit in clear tax evasion and law breaking rather than legitimate tax avoidance,' he said. 

Potential fallout 

The disclosures could see governments step up their efforts to prosecute tax evaders and the bank itself.

Governments are looking to crack down on tax evasion to bolster their coffers depleted by the financial crisis and amid criticism that the rich aren't paying their fair share.

In Britain, the report sparked criticism of tax authorities. The national tax agency clawed back £135million ($236 million) from some of the 3,600 Britons identified as using the Geneva branch of HSBC, but only one person has been prosecuted. France, by contrast, launched 103 legal actions.

'You are left wondering, as you see the enormity of what has been going on, what it actually takes to bring a tax cheat to court,' Margaret Hodge, chair of Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, told the BBC.

Hodge said the former chairman of HSBC, Stephen Green, must face questions about whether he was 'asleep at the wheel, or he did know and he was therefore involved in dodgy tax practices.'

In Belgium, an investigating judge is considering arrest warrants against some former and current officials of the HSBC bank if cooperation in an investigation on the Swiss operations does not improve. 

What HSBC says 

HSBC stressed that the documents were from eight years ago and said it has since implemented initiatives designed to prevent its banking services from being used to evade taxes or launder money.

Franco Morra, CEO of HSBC's Swiss subsidiary, said the new management had shut down accounts from clients who 'did not meet our high standards.'

'These disclosures about historical business practices are a reminder that the old business model of Swiss private banking is no longer acceptable,' he said in a statement.

The investigation centers on prices for gold, silver, platinum and palladium. It is being carried out by the Justice Department with help from Commodity Futures Trading Commission

Barclays paid £290million in penalties to US and UK regulators in June 2012 to settle Libor rate-rigging claims.

Libor, which stands for London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, is a benchmark that indicates the interest rate that banks charge when lending to each other and is seen as fundamental to the operation of both UK and world markets.

Alleged rigging is said to have involved the submission of false figures in order either to make more money or to paint a false picture of a bank's health.

A review in September 2012 found that the manipulation of the way it was fixed had damaged trust in the financial system.

HSBC was one of several banks named in lawsuits filed in U.S. courts last year alleging a conspiracy to manipulate gold, silver, platinum and palladium prices, as well as precious metals derivatives, during the daily precious metals fixes. 

The century-old gold fix is a standard price for the metal that banks set twice a day over the phone. Some gold traders claim they were harmed by a scheme to manipulate the fix.

The banks operating the precious metals benchmarks, known as the fixes, said last year they would no longer administer that process.

An electronic daily silver price benchmark is now administered by Thomson Reuters and CME Group, while the London Metal Exchange provides twice-daily benchmark platinum and palladium prices.

ICE Benchmark Administration will run an electronic gold price benchmark from March 20 to replace the London gold fix.

Switzerland's financial watchdog said in November it had found a 'clear attempt' to manipulate precious metals price benchmarks.

An investigation by German regulator Bafin found no signs of attempted benchmark price manipulation in precious metals, newspaper Handelsblatt reported last month.

HSBC is currently under intense scrutiny over practices at its Swiss private bank, where it is said to have helped clients dodge taxes.

It said past practices at this bank were 'unacceptable' as it reported that 2014 net income fell 16 percent to $13.7billion.

HSBC acknowledged Monday that 2014 profits 'disappointed' and said the figures included the costs of paying settlements to cover past failings. 

These include $550million the bank set aside last year to cover penalties for manipulating foreign currency markets.
