A divorcee who convinced her lover, a former NFL player, to shoot dead her millionaire boyfriend to access his life insurance has been jailed for life.

Nanette Ann Packard, 46, was convicted of murder earlier this year after her live-in boyfriend William McLaughlin was shot dead in his kitchen in December 1994.

Packard was living with McLaughlin, 21 years her senior, while also dating former New England Patriots linebacker Eric Naposki, who worked as a bouncer at a local nightclub.

Theft: Packard's murder trial heard she also stole $500,000 from McLaughlin's estate both before and after his death

She convinced the former NFL star to murder McLaughlin, having stood to collect $1million on the medical technology boss's life insurance, along with a further $150,000 and free rent for a year in one of his properties.

Naposki entered McLaughlin's lavish house in Newport Beach using a key given to him by Packard, and shot the millionaire in the chest six times.

Packard's murder trial earlier this year also heard she went on to steal at least $500,000 from McLaughlin's estate both before and after his death.

She admitted grand theft in 1996 and was sentenced to a year in jail, but the murder case went cold for 13 years before new evidence in 2009 connected Packard and Naposki to the shooting.

Authorities subsequently arrested Johnston, living in Ladera Ranch with her third husband, and Naposki, living in Greenwich, Connecticut.

Investigators had long suspected Packard and Naposki, but it was only when new technology was used to identify the murder weapon, along with a new witness, that charges were filed.

McLaughlin's family today branded Packard 'vile' as the mother-of-two was handed a life jail term without parole for the millionaire's murder, having been convicted of first degree murder in January.

Naposki, 45, who played for the New England Patriots between 1988 and 1989, was convicted of first degree murder last July, and will be sentenced on August 10.

The court heard during Packard's trial she met McLaughlin after he responded to an advert she had placed in a dating magazine for wealthy men.

She had described herself as 'a well-educated woman who knows how to take care of her man'.

They began dating and she later moved in with McLaughlin, who made a fortune in medical technologies after developing a blood-filtering prototype.

Speaking outside Orange County Superior COurt yesterday after Packard's sentencing, Kim McLaughlin Bayless said: 'The fact that you, Nanette, destroyed so many lives, including my Dad's, is vile. ... You had absolutely no right to take him from us for your own selfish reasons.

'He was incredibly good to you for four whole years.

'It's a lot of closure for us.'

In 1996, Packard pleaded guilty to writing checks from McLaughlin's account without his knowledge.

During Naposki's trial, his defense attorney argued that Packard was the only one who had a motive to kill McLaughlin, who had a successful medical technology business.

Hill argued during Packard's trial that the football player acted alone out of fear she would leave him.
