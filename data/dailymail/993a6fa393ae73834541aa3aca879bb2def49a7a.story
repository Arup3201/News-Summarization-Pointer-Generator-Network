The South Sydney Rabbitohs have clenched their first rugby league premiership in 43 years, winning by 24 points against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.

But it did not come easy for the red-and-green clad team, losing prop David Tyrrell just over an hour into the game - who was carted off the field on a stretcher and in a neck brace - after a horrific head-on clash with  Bulldogs’ James Graham.

English brothers Sam and George Burgess also turned in courageous performances to run over the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 30-6.

Earlier in the night, Sam Burgess walked off the field worse for wear after the first half of the NRL Grand Final, with a suspected fractured cheek bone.

About 10 minutes into the end-of-season match, the star player took a heavy hit as his mother, Julie, watched from stands of Sydney's ANZ Stadium at Olympic Park.

It had an eerie similarity to an incident suffered by former South Sydney prop John Sattler who broke his jaw during the 1970 rugby league grand final but continued to play on to victory against the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles.

While walking off the field after the half-time siren, Channel Nine commentator Brad Fittler asked Sam Burgess about his cheek and the footy star mumbled: 'It's f***ed.'

Minutes after Sam Burgess took a blow to his face, his brother, George Burgess, was taken off the field with a suspected concussion.

But both brothers returned to the field to play on until full-time.

The smile could not be wiped off the face of Rabbitohs' owner Russell Crowe who maintained his poker face until the final siren blew

John Sattler had nothing but good things to say about Sam Burgess as they were interviewed after the drought-breaking match

As the final siren sounded over the stadium, Sam Burgess broke down in tears as his team broke its four-decade-long premiership drought.

His teammates carried him over the field propped on their shoulders, reminiscent of the moment John Sattler's colleagues did the same in 1970.

The cheers from the Rabbitoh fans were deafening as Burgess paid tribute to those closest to him - calling his mother 'the greatest woman in the world' - as well as the fans.

'I love my family...most of all we did for you fans,' Burgess said.

He also gave a shout out to the Rabbitohs' owner, Australian actor Russell Crowe: 'Russell, good on you, buddy - what a man.' 

Of his injury, Burgess said he felt as if he had 'cracked my eyeball'. 

The British-born player also took home the Clive Churchill Medal for man of the match but shared the victory with his teammates.

'I'm accepting this on behalf of my team... one player probably doesn't deserve this [the medal],' the gracious Burgess told the crowd.

'I want to thank the fans for a cracking year I'll never forget.'

John Sattler said Burgess would be remembered for years to come in the history books, while the Rabbitohs forward said the former prop was an 'inspiration'.

But the compliments did not just come from rugby greats for the Clive Churchill medallist but from his brothers as well who showed there was no sibling rivalry among the Burgess clan.

'Sam Burgess is my hero,' Tom Burgess said. 

After the game, Rabbitoh fans congregated outside the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club on Anzac Parade in Kingsford - in the city's eastern suburbs.

Supporters waited outside the clubhouse for about two hours before the grand final winners showed up, holding the premiership cup above their heads.

One of the people among the crowd was Andrei Perederiy told Daily Mail Australia police - some on horseback - had closed off 200m of Anzac Parade between Wallace Street and Sturt Street.

'The whole block if full, the carpark is full. Whole families are in the crowd - it's a good vibe,' he said.

'The team is making speeches.'

Fans of the Rabbitohs are hoping for a win after a 43-year premiership drought, while the Bulldogs won their last premiership in 2004

Australian actor Russell Crowe will no doubt be part of the 83,333-strong at the stadium as he is the owner of the South Sydney side

The grand final will also include a performance from U.S. band Train and guitarist Slash of Guns N' Roses fame

Hours before kick off, a sea of football fanatics coloured in red and green or blue and white were seen streaming into ANZ Stadium ahead of NRL's biggest clash.

Fans of the Rabbitohs and Bulldogs got creative donning face paint, decorating bikes and turning flags into capes to show their support.

The pre-game festivities included stalls and buskers to get supporters geared up for the end-of-season match, which kicked off at 7.20pm on Sunday at the stadium. 

The heat did not stop fans from braving the elements on Sunday, which is the hottest NRL grand final day on record, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.

At 5pm on Sunday, the mercury peaked at 34.3 degrees at Olympic Park which broke the previous record set by last year's 33.4 degrees.

Rabbitohs fans will be hungry for a win to break the team's 43-year premiership drought.  

The last time the South Sydney side were crowned premiers was in 1971 before colour television was introduced in Australia in 1975. 

But while the red-and-green clad team were the first to put some points on the score board, its players did not fare as well during the first half.  

Leading up to Sunday's clash, Rabbitohs owner Russell Crowe has been actively recruiting his Tinsel Town friends to get behind his team.

Rapper Snoop Dogg has been a long-time supporter of the side after being spotted in a South Sydney guernsey as early as 2007.

On Friday, the recording artist - who is also known as Snoop Lion - posted a message from the Australian actor which contained details on how to watch the grand final clash.

But Snoop Dogg is not the only famous face Crowe has recruited to the red and green.

UK comedian Ricky Gervais tweeted on Friday: 'That bloke @russellcrowe tells me that the NRL grand final is quite a big deal this year' and hash-tagged 'Go Rabbitohs'.

Crowe, 50, joined the sell-out 83,333-strong crowd at the spectacle, which also included performances from U.S. band Train, guitarist Slash of Guns N' Roses fame and former The Superjesus frontwoman Sarah McLeod.

Daily Mail Australia reported on Saturday, singer Justin Timberlake - who is currently touring the country - turned down $2 million to play at the event, which they were hoping would rival the U.S. Superbowl.

There is not mistaking which team this Rabbitohs supporter is barracking for in this year's NRL Premiership Grand Final
