A couple are searching for answers after a police officer shot dead their beloved dog Hank after he escaped their yard - but will not face a review.

Matthew and Allison Belanger, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, said they were shocked when the officer knocked on their door on Thursday to say he had shot a dog and wanted to see if it was theirs.

They assumed it wouldn't be their 35-pound mixed breed dog Hank, a loving pet who they thought was safely contained in the yard. So they were stunned to see his body on the ground.

'When I saw Hank, I lost it,' Mr Belanger, 24, wrote in an account of the incident on Facebook.

Missed: Hank the dog, pictured with one of the family cats, was shot dead by a police officer on Thursday evening after he reportedly became aggressive towards a woman while she was walking her dog

Despite never having escaped before, Hank had somehow got through a gate in their yard and had wandered into the street.

The police told the Tulsa World that Hank had run over to a woman walking her dog and became aggressive so she sprayed him with pepper spray. He continued to be aggressive, she said.

She called police and when the officer, Don Chandler, arrived, Hank again became aggressive, police said. Chandler shouted at the dog to stop and when he did not, he shot the animal twice.

Officer Leland Ashley told the Tulsa World that the police report - which is not yet available - did not mention any injuries to the woman who had called police.

He added that the officer will not face a review board for the shooting, as is protocol, but that he did have to explain in detail his decision to use deadly force. 

Questions: Hank pictured with his family's other dog, Harriet. His owners say they find it hard to believe that he became so aggressive  - and questioned why the officer didn't Tase or hit the dog before shooting him

Gentle: Hank was shot after he somehow got out of the couple's yard - which he had never done before

When Belanger went into the street and learned what had happened, he 'lost it', he said.

'I yelled at the police asking them why they had to shoot him,' he wrote. 'He is a 30 pound dog for goodness sake. What about a taser, a baton, or even a kick to the face?'

Family: Matthew and Allison Belanger said they have no children so it was as if Hank was their son

He said that he was horrified when the police said that he should be fined for having the dog out. 

'Again, I lost it,' he wrote in the Facebook post. 'I yelled at them that it was absurd that I had to pay a fine for them to unjustly (my opinion, obviously) kill my dog.

'I wish it were easy to believe that the police were honest and telling the truth but things just did not make sense.

'How they described his behavior was totally uncharacteristic of Hank.'

He said that the dog, who was adopted by his brother-in-law a few years ago, took a liking to him and his wife and they ultimately took him in when his brother-in-law could not longer look after him.

'It is hard not to get attached to a dog that loves you so deeply,' Belanger wrote on Facebook. 

'Allison and I do not have children yet so - in a way - Hank was like our little boy.'

He recounted how Hank doted on their other pets, and when one of their cats had feline leukemia and could no longer look after herself, Hank would clean her instead.

'I know "every dog owner thinks their dog is the sweetest dog in the world" but Hank really was one of the sweetest in the world,' he said.

Loving: Matthew explained how gentle the 35-pound dog was with their other animals, recalling how he would clean one of their cats when she developed leukemia and could no longer clean herself

Home: Mr Belanger said the police officer knocked on his door to say he had shot a dog outside but he never thought it would be Hank. He was stunned when he saw the dog's body in the road

'He lived to be petted, eat wet dog food and doggie bacon, and sleep on our laps.'

Speaking to the Tulsa World, Belanger said he was skeptical of the police's version of events and that his dog likely approached the woman because he wanted to be petted.

He also said he has no idea how the gate opened, and suggested that children in the neighborhood might have opened it.

'I trust the police,' he said. 'I trust that they're here to protect us. It's just hard for me to believe that this was the only option available - to shoot a dog that had only loved people his entire life.'
