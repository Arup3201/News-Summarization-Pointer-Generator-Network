An alleged gang member who is on bail for gun possession has been taunting police while enjoying his freedom, showing off his access to cash and party lifestyle on social media.

Mohammad Qais Niazy, 23, posted pictures of himself shamelessly using $100 bills to write lewd messages directed at police and numerous pictures of him snorting a white powder.

In the three months since he was surprisingly given bail, Niazy, from western Sydney, has posted a series of controversial images on Facebook despite his strict parole conditions.

He has used $100 notes to spell out 'f*** all cops' and shared shameless videos and photos of himself snorting large amounts of a white substance.

Another photo was posted on December 27 of the young man snorting a white, crystallised substance which had been used to form the phrase 'f*** all b*****'.

'Lol this will get you on the news!' commented one of Niazy's friends.  

Two other photographs were also uploaded of Niazy posing next to copious amounts of the same white substance, alongside huge piles of cash. 

In a brash move, the 23-year-old shared a photo of himself excitedly posing with the leader of the Nomads gang, Simon Taijour.

'The head of AMF Nd the head of NOMADS!!,' Niazy gushed alongside the photograph. 

Late last year, Niazy was formally charged with several firearms offences, including possessing a shortened firearm and contravening a firearms prohibition order, according to News Limited.

The young man, who also goes by the names Ace Niazy and Ali Gewad, is accused of keeping a shortened semi-automatic shot gun at a residence in Wentworthville, western Sydney. 

It's alleged he used tape around the barrel of the gun in an attempt to avoid leaving fingerprints. 

However, traces of his DNA were found on the weapon, according to police documents.

Niazy has used social media to lash out at the law enforcement officers responsible for his arrest, including the Middle-Eastern Organised Crime Squad (MEOC).

The MEOC has been set up to target the culture of crime that exists within the Middle Eastern community in western Sydney.

'F*** the meoc. f*** the gang squad. f*** the afp (Australian Federal Police). f*** the crime commision f*** them all hehehehehehehe... (sic)' he wrote on February 11, accompanied by the picture of his message written with his carefully positioned cash.

Niazy is accused of being a core member of the Afghani Murderers gang and having past association with notorious bikie gang, Hells Angels. 

Also known as the Afghani Mafia Family, the Afghani Murderers have been in existence for around two years and proclaim themselves to be the replacement for the now former gang, 'Brothers 4 Life'. 

Niazy's brother Mohammad Wais Niazy, also known as Cisco, is also accused of being involved with the gang.
