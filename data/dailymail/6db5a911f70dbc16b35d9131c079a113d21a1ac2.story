Andy Murray created a public relations storm two months ago with his pro-Scottish independence tweet and we wait to see if more fallout comes on Thursday night.

For against him as he fights for his life at the Barclays ATP World Finals is Roger Federer, the player whose popularity transcends national boundaries, nowhere more so than in London.

The last time these two met at the O2 Arena, in 2012, public fondness for Murray had been soaring, partly due to his brave and emotional bid for the Wimbledon title that year, and partly due to his contribution to Britain’s gold rush at the Olympics.

So it was something of a surprise to find that, despite all this, more than half the crowd that night supported the Swiss as he overcame the longtime London-based player with consummate ease.

The atmosphere was not so much anti-Murray but pro-Federer. It is hard to overstate the gooey devotion that the Swiss inspires in tennis fans, and this event has become like a convention for him with hundreds of his compatriots adding to the general level of support.

Crowd reaction will provide a fascinating subtext, especially as it is probable that by the time they play Federer will already have qualified for Saturday’s semi-finals with Murray still battling for a place.

A host of permutations are possible at the start of play, when Milos Raonic takes on Kei Nishikori in the other group match, but by the evening things should be clearer. Federer is always the darling when he steps on court here, but Murray has also had a decent reception this week, especially when he beat Raonic to stay alive on Tuesday night.

Federer       2-0      4-0      25-12

Nishikori     1-1      2-2      17-20

Murray        1-1      2-2      21-20 

Raonic         0-2      0-4      15-26

The 27-year-old Scot fully expects many to support his opponent tonight but does not believe that will decide the match.

‘It is not the No 1 factor, that is what is happening on the tennis court,’ he said. ‘I have always said that if you have the crowd with you it helps. I am sure the crowd will be fairly split, they have been when I have played Roger in London before. He always gets great support wherever he goes.’

The one exception was the Olympic final, where Federer was taken aback by the patriotic fervour that swept the Union Jack-wearing player to the gold medal. ‘The atmosphere was amazing,’ said Murray. ‘I have played a lot of matches at Wimbledon but I have never experienced the Centre Court being like that.’

Many will dismiss the Scot’s abandonment of his previously determined neutrality on Scottish independence as irrelevant, and of course he was entitled to his view.

However, with feelings running high there is no doubt that it dented his image with many, not to mention his commercial value. Yet it looks to have had a positive impact on his tennis, starting the week after it happened, at Shenzen in China. 

Murray has batted away the subject when asked but people who were around him that week say he was subdued and withdrawn, as if dazed by the stinging reaction.

He explained to one that, while proud to be British, he would have struggled to live with himself if he had not expressed a preference on the issue, having only made up his mind late on.

The whole episode seemed to galvanise the competitive instincts that had been missing this year until then. He subsequently won a series of close-fought matches, and that is the whole reason why he qualified for the top-eight event in London, where he can now make the last four.

The contest is even more beguiling because he and Federer have a close personal rivalry that is politely cordial at best. ‘I haven’t spent loads of time with him,’ said Murray. ‘We never practise together but I have always chatted to him when I have seen him. We have never had any issues away from the court.’

Their career record is 11-11 but at the O2 Arena it is 3-0 to the Swiss, the supreme indoor player who also took control in their 2012 Wimbledon final once the roof was closed for rain. To try to simplify the mathematics, Murray’s hopes are best served by Raonic beating Nishikori, a distinct possibility given that the Japanese has had wrist problems.

If that happens, Murray will go through with any kind of victory over Federer. But it won’t be easy and it will be in Federer’s interest to finish top of the group.

‘It can be a difficult proposition if you are going in thinking, “A ll I have to do is win a set”. That doesn’t help because we are not used to those situations,’ said Murray.

‘I’ve just got to go out thinking I have to beat Roger.’

US Open champion Marin Cilic became the first player to face almost certain elimination when he was crushed 6-3, 6-1 by Tomas Berdych as his form continued to unwind after winning at Flushing Meadows.

With world No1 Novak Djokovic beating Stan Wawrinka 6-3, 6-0, there has still not been a decent singles contest. The opening eight singles matches have all been decided in straight sets, with the undercard doubles making more compelling viewing. Djokovic said: ‘Stan wasn’t close to his best and I succeeded very well.’
