A Hungarian man who smashed a borrowed £186,000 Lamborghini is now selling the wreckage online - for just £4,000.

Csapo Joska, 35, crashed his friend's brand new Lamborghini Huracan in an attempt to show off the supercar's V10 engine at 208mph.

Picking up the pieces: Csapo Joska, 35, crashed his friend's brand new Lamborghini Huracan as he sped down a highway outside Budapest last year

The Lamborghini burst into flames, leaving little but the frame left of the car, which has now gone on sale online. 

Now, the wreckage has emerged on a Hungarian website, up for sale with a price tag of £4,000. 

The advertisement reads: 'Lamborghini Huracan, one previous owner, sold as seen.'

Police who seized the mobile phone footage of Mr Joska's crash released it online as a warning to others about the dangers of speeding. 

Mr Joska escaped unharmed, although his unnamed friend who had been filming their ride, was in hospital for eight days after the accident near the Hungarian capital Budapest in September.

On offer: The Lamborghini Huracan, pictured before the crash, is worth £186,000 in its original state

Nice try: Mr Joska has put what is left of the Lamborghini up for sale, with a pricetag of £4,000

Nasty smash: As Mr Joska was breaking the law when speeding, the insurance company will not pay damages and he is thought to be selling the wreckage online to pay for fines

Police have charged Mr Joska with numerous offences, and local media said he had put the parts online to try and get back some of the money he is going to have to pay in compensation and fines.

According to police because Mr Joska was travelling at an illegal high-speed, the insurance company has refused to pay for the damage.

Meanwhile, in China, police are looking for the owner of a £500,000 Lamborghini that appears to have been abandoned after a car accident.

Second crash: This Lamborghini was abandoned on the highway in Hangzhou, eastern China

The owner was seen walking from the wreckage after the crash but police are still trying to locate him

Expensive crash: The 2011 Lamborghini Gallardo is said to be worth around £519,000

The orange Lamborghini Gallardo was left in the middle of a busy motorway in the city of Hangzhou, in eastern China's Zhejiang province, after the owner ran from the scene. 

Witnesses who called authorities said that the driver had been overtaking them at high speed but lost control on the wet road, and smashed into the guardrail. 

Hangzhou police are now looking to find the driver, believed to have been injured in the accident, to work out why he left the scene and his expensive car behind.

The car is a 2011 model Gallardo, which is said to be worth  around 4.9 million RMB (£519,000).
