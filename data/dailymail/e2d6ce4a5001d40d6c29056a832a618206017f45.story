Andy Murray has criticised Alex Salmond’s decision to ‘photobomb’ David Cameron with a Saltire after he won last year’s Wimbledon finals.

Stressing he always plays as a Brit, yhe tennis ace said he ‘didn’t like it’ when the First Minister unfurled the flag in the Royal Box, moments after his dramatic win over Novak Djokovic.

Mr Salmond was widely criticised at the time for trying to hijack the sporting triumph to push his case for Scottish independence, with critics telling him to ‘put it away dear’.

Scottish Nationalist leader Alex Salmond waved the Scottish flag after Andy Murray won the 2013 Wimbledon Men's Singles final

Murray has revealed he 'didn't like it' but was nervous about expressing a view on Scottish independence

Mr Salmond smuggled the blue and white flag into Centre Court in the handbag of his wife, Moira.

As the crowd stood to applaud Murray’s win in straight sets, he pulled the Saltire out and waved it around directly behind Mr Cameron’s head.

The move was seen as a crass attempt to politicise one of the crown jewels in the sporting calendar.

Now, almost a year later, Murray himself has admitted he was not happy with the stunt.

In an interview with the Sunday Times he said had met Mr Salmond after winning the US Open in 2012.

‘He seemed perfectly nice to me but I didn’t like it when he [Salmond] got the Scottish flag up at Wimbledon,’ Murray said.

Mr Salmond defended his behaviour last year, insisting it had been a long time coming.

Barack Obama spoke out against independence

Alex Salmond today expressed surprise at US President Barack Obama issuing a public warning against independence.

Mr Obama last week said the US wanted Britain to remain ‘strong, robust, united and effective’, adding: ‘From the 
outside, at least, it looks like things have worked pretty well.'

In response, Mr Salmond told BBC One's Mar Show: ;It was certainly surprising, because the American government had made it very clear they were staying studiously neutral in the democratic referendum that is taking place in Scotland. 

'But then of course, David Cameron has been begging everybody internationally to say anything to help with his travails at the moment. He’s right to be worried, incidentally – the latest yes poll’s at 46 per cent.

'So perhaps on the Richter scale of presidential interventions, this was pretty mild. It’s a matter for the folks of Scotland; he hopes that the UK will be strong and united as an ally.

Well, if Scotland becomes independent, America will have two allies in these islands, not one.'

'It’s the first Scot since Harold Mahony in 1896 – it’s not something that happens very often, so I think a few saltires hoisted over Wimbledon doesn’t really harm at all, the SNP leader said.

'This was after the match was finished, incidentally. This was part of the celebration.

'And the answer is no, I am not responsible for the seating arrangements in the royal box.

'I had the flag last year, actually – I just didn’t get the chance to wave it.'  

But Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove said at the time: 'I think it was a wee bit of a stunt... my advice to Alex would just be "Put it away dear".'

Murray remains cautious about being seen to express a view on the prospect of Scotland breaking away from the UK, but he insisted he had always played as a Brit.

He added: ‘I started competing for Great Britain when I was 11.

‘I’m 27 now and I’ve been competing for Great Britain for 16 years.’

A year before winning the Wimbledon championships in 2013, Murray won gold on the same court in the London 2012 Olympic Games.

But he said he did not know who he would play for if Scotland does go it alone.

Voters in Scotland will decide whether to back independence in a referendum on September 18.

While recent polls have suggested support for independence is growing, an IpsosMORI last week put Yes on 36 per cent and No on 54 per cent.

Politicians on both sides of the debate have locked horns on the merits and dangers of breaking up the UK, but few Scottish celebrities have spoken out in fear of alienating half of the country.

Actor Sean Connery is backing the Yes campaign, while singer Rod Stewart, comedian Billy Connolly and cyclist Sir Chris Hoy have voiced doubts about independence.

Those who have urged Scotland to stay in the UK – including singer David Bowie – have been viciously criticised online by the so-called CyberNats.

Mr Salmond insisted that there was nothing wrong with celebrating the first Scot winning Wimbledon since 1896

Murray suggested this was playing a part in his decision not to express a view either way.

'I don’t know even when I was younger whether that is something I would have talked about,’ he added.

‘It’s very difficult to have an opinion these days because half the people will agree with you and half of the people will think you’re an absolute idiot,’ he said. 

A spokesman for Mr Salmond said: 'Andy is reigning Wimbledon Champion and a great Scottish tennis player. He has made it clear a number of times that he doesn't want to comment on Scottish politics.

'Everyone should just accept that and let him get on with playing tennis, rather than attempt to put him on the spot about who he would play for in a future Olympics.'
