With holiday travel upon us, many jet-setters will be venturing to new and distant locales over the upcoming winter months.

But with these exotic destinations and once-in-a-lifetime experiences may also come a very real fear of unknowingly falling victim to a dreaded travel scam.

Whether it's a taxi driver attempting to overcharge your fare or an airport tag-team stealing belongings at security checkpoint, Cheapflights.co.uk has highlighted the seven most common travel scams - and how to avoid them.

Heading stateside? Fake wake-up calls are of particular concern and it's not uncommon for an unsuspecting hotel guest to receive a late-night call from a caller pretending to be from the hotel front desk, asking for credit card information.

In such an instance, hang up - and call the front desk yourself to confirm that it was really them and not a prisoner using a smuggled cell phone. 

For those taking a quick weekend break to Eastern Europe, be on the look out for fake plain clothes police officers with semi-legitimate looking badges and be sure not to fall victim to the infamous 'baby toss.'

A scheme used by groups of panhandlers or beggars, a woman will toss something toward you that vaguely resembles a swaddled baby. Before a tourist can realise that the 'baby' is really just a doll, the group has already made off with money or valuables.

Keep in mind, however, that these horror stories aren't meant to scare - instead, they are cautionary tales to encourage holidaymakers to be vigilant and aware of those who may look to take advantage.

Cheapflights.co.uk spokesperson Oonagh Shiel said: 'Highly-organised tourist cams play on travellers' trusting nature, their lack of local knowledge and desire to save a bit of cash.'

'Often, victims don't realise they've been caught out until it's too late.  

Even the most seasoned traveller may be targeted in unfamiliar surroundings, so minimise risk by keeping your passport secure, your belongings close to your body, and by leaving all unnecessarily expensive items at home.

'Our key piece of advice is to keep your wits about you at all times,' she added.
