We've all been guilty of over-packing for a holiday abroad.

Even if you're only jetting off on a quick weekend jaunt, it's easy to start dreaming up every possible weather contingency or holiday activity scenario that could have you needing those knee-high wellies, your full gym kit, or one of your many hair-styling gadgets.

But does anyone ever actually use these 'must have' items? Almost never.

Don't let this happen to you! Ensure that you never over-pack again with these top expert tips

To help you solve any of your potential packing problems, we've gone right to the source, polling several top travel writers, fashion bloggers and beauty gurus on their must-have - and must-leave-behind - holiday items. 

Blowdryers, flat irons, curling irons

This one often winds up being completely redundant. 'Almost all hotels and many hostels have them,' says Julie Falconer, writer and owner of travel blog, A Lady in London. 'Hairdryers just take up a lot of space in luggage.'

'Plus, if you're travelling abroad, you'll often find that your hairdryer doesn't even work due to different electric voltage in other countries.' 

Leave your blowdryers at home... most hotels and hostels have them these days anyway 

More than one jacket or coat

This is a packing faux pas with one heavy price to pay - it will weigh your bag down and may even require you to opt for a checked case over carry-on luggage.

'Too many coats and jackets can be a pain because they take up space and weight,'  British fashion blogger, Susie Bubble, admits. 'On cold breaks away, I've now learnt to just wear one on-board and stick to it.'

You won't wear those flimsy summer dresses - and if you do, you'll wind up freezing, like this woman (left)

Seasonally inappropriate dresses

'I always pack lots of slip dresses,' Susie continues. 'I don't even know where one buys slip dresses anymore but I have a stash of vintage ones that in my head are 'handy' for holidays. I'll layer them, I think. That never happens.'

Noted: leave all rarely worn flimsy frocks at home.

Trainers  take up a lot of space in your carry-on, and, be honest: will you really hit the hotel gym?

A full gym kit

It's been a busy week leading up to your holiday in the sun and you haven't had time to exercise. No problem, you think, I'll work out in the hotel gym once I arrive.

This is rarely the case.

Instead, you wind up taking up precious space with trainers, spandex leggings and a sports bra that you won't look at again during your getaway.

If you pack your best lingerie, you're more likely to meet the man of your dreams, right? Er, maybe not...

Lingerie 

If you plan for it, that must mean that you'll meet the man of your dreams on holiday, doesn't it? Of course there's always a chance, but that stiff corset you shoved into your bag probably isn't even all that necessary when it comes to wooing said hypothetical guy. 

Way too many tampons

Even if it's not that dreaded time of the month - doesn't matter - a lady must always be prepared. Nevermind the fact that almost any destination you're heading off to will likely sell the products in question, we all know those women who insist on bringing the entire variety pack.

Even if it's not that time of the month, many women still feel the need to pack several variety packs

Several handbag options

You need one for touring during the day, a smaller option for a night out, and a carry-all for the plane, right? Before you know it, half of your suitcase is comprised of handbags.

We went to the experts to find the perfect all-round option.

'I take a rucksack or a roomy crossover bag with secure closures,' Susie says. 'I don't do clutches on holiday - too easy to lose or get stolen and not enough room to carry all the essentials.'

Think you'll read that book you've been meaning to for months? Probably not on the plane...

That book you’ve been meaning to read 

Chances are, if the book has been collecting dust on your bookshelf for several weeks, your upcoming plane ride is almost certainly not the time you'll finally crack it open.

Excessive amounts of beauty products

An array of moisturisers and cleansers? Leave them. Nail varnish remover? Nope, you won't use it. When it comes to bringing beauty products abroad, stick to the basics and try to opt for an all-in-one compact.

Makeup artist and Pixiwoo video blogger, Samantha Chapman, says: 'I tend to take products that have multiple purposes, like BB creams that have coverage and SPF or lip and cheek duos.'

'Micellar water is also great as it removes makeup from eyes, lips and cheeks,' adds Susannah Taylor, editor of beauty website, Get The Gloss.

Instead of taking your entire beauty bag, opt for products that pull double duty or an all-in-one compact

Expensive jewellery

Why risk it? 

Those shoes you never wear (be it sky-high stilettos or rubber wellie boots)

'One pair of shoes for walking around during the day and another for any dressier occasions in the evening is usually sufficient,' Julie says. 'Leave the 'just in case' shoes at home. They can take up a lot of packing space, often unnecessarily.'

Those sky-high stilettos you never wear? The best time to try them out is definitely not during a holiday

Stay aware from alluring airport bargains! The only travel accessory you really need is an adaptor

Loads of travel gadgets and accessories

All you really need is an adaptor (depending on where you're headed) and your smart phone to keep you connected.

And when it comes to those bargain travel accessories, skip the airport shops and their allure - including those inflatable pillows, hand-held fans and under-clothes money belts.‘I have a leopard eye mask that I always think I will use, but in reality, am far too embarrassed to take out of my bag,’ says Todd Plummer, a New York City-based fashion writer.

Full-size shampoo and conditioner 

This can be a tempting one. After all, you never know how the cold air, or alternatively, the heat and humidity, will mess with your hair. Still, most hotels do leave mini versions out for guests and, really, is packing the gargantuan bottles really worth being forced to check your bag?
