Brendan Rodgers has revealed that Raheem Sterling has been offered a 'wonderful deal' to remain at Liverpool.

But the England international has yet to agree terms after talks stalled for a number of months and Rodgers said the club would not be held to ransom over his future.

Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel and Dominic King, who have been following the negotiations closely, answer all the burning questions on the Sterling situation.

Raheem Sterling's contract negotiations at Liverpool continue to drag on, despite the club offering the England international a 'wonderful deal' in the words of manager Brendan Rodgers

WILL STERLING STAY AT LIVERPOOL OR MOVE TO PASTURES NEW?

Sami Mokbel: My gut feeling is that he'll sign a new contract at Liverpool. Despite the long-winded contract talks, there's certainly a willingness from Sterling to stay. 

He's enjoying his football and enjoys being a key first-team member. There's no guarantees of that anywhere else. 

But it's also key to remember that Sterling, having tasted it for the first time this season, is keen to continue playing in the Champions League.

It's viewed as a key part in his overall development as a player. How long will he accept being out of Europe's premier club competition?

Dominic King: The first thing to point out is that Sterling is happy at Liverpool. He has become an important member of the team and has thrived under Brendan Rodgers' guidance. 

Sterling has also given no indication that he wants to leave. Plenty of clubs would want to sign one of the top young players in Europe but Liverpool have absolutely no appetite to sell. 

There is no prospect of him moving anywhere soon.

WHY ARE THESE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS TAKING THIS AMOUNT OF TIME?

Sami Mokbel: Contract negotiations for top players are always long, drawn-out affairs.

Look at Eden Hazard, for example. Talks over a new contract at Chelsea started months before Sterling's and there's still no confirmation of his commitment. 

Brendan Rodgers has identified Sterling as one of the premier young players in Europe. Sterling's advisors are only right to bide their time over ensuring they secure the best possible deal for their client.

Dominic King: Liverpool have put together a package that Rodgers described as a 'wonderful deal'.

It will see his wages go from their current £35,000 per week basic to, with incentives and bonuses, a figure that could get close to £100,000 per week. 

Sterling's advisors are playing hard and are looking to secure the absolute maximum for their client. At the moment they have reached deadlock.

Sterling is set for a bright future for both club and country - he is a central part of Roy Hodgson's plans

ARE LIVERPOOL FANS GETTING FRUSTRATED?

Sami Mokbel: Probably. It's the uncertainty that will keep them agitated. Liverpool fans, traditionally, aren't used to losing their top players. In Sterling they are faced with that very prospect. 

The landscape of English and European football has changed, however, as Liverpool are no longer the pinnacle. Other clubs are now viewed as being more prestigious. Supporters must accept that.

Dominic King: Yes, they want the situation sorted out - that much was obvious from Steven Gerrard's comments ahead of the Merseyside derby - but they are more frustrated with the stories that have come out. 

The noise around the situation needs to be turned down. There is no sense, though, that they are frustrated with Sterling as individual. He is not the one doing the negotiating.

WHAT ARE STERLING'S ALTERNATIVES TO ANFIELD IF NEGOTIATIONS FALL DOWN?

Sami Mokbel: In short, the elite of European football. There'll be no shortage of high-profile takers should Sterling's time at Anfield come to an end. 

Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain are monitoring the situation closely. 

Sportsmail understands that Manchester City and Chelsea have sat up and taken notice of the contract impasse.

Dominic King: That question is hypothetical at the minute. Liverpool are not looking to sell the player, Sterling does not want to leave and there are still another four months of the season remaining, so where would he go at this moment?

Of course plenty of clubs would be interested in signing Sterling but would Liverpool do business with one of their rivals in the Barclays Premier League? That would be highly unlikely. 

Would a move abroad suit him at just 20 years of age? Again that is open to debate.
