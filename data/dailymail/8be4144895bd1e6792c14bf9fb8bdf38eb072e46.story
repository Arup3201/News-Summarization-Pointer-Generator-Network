President Barack Obama towered over the Japanese emperor on a visit to Tokyo's Imperial Palace today at the start of his Asia tour.

The U.S. leader landed in the Japanese captial yesterday on the first official state visit to the country by a serving U.S. president in 20 years.

He started today with an audience with Emperor Akihito at the Imperial Palace, with the tall president dwarfing the small Japanese head of state.

The president joked with the emperor saying that the last time they met, he did not have any grey hairs.

But the Japanese monarch was very sympathetic replying: 'You have a very hard job.'

Mr Obama was invited to the Imperial Palace, a lush park-like complex surrounded by modern skyscrapers to start his Asia tour.

He was greeted by smiling schoolchildren waving Japanese and U.S. flags before he solemnly inspected a rifle-bearing military guard of honour.

After taking in the scene, Mr Obama shook hands with Japanese dignitaries in front of the sprawling palace.

He then walked along a maze of red carpet into the Imperial Palace for a private meeting with the emperor, empress, U.S. ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy and other aides.

After making several other visits, he then returned to the Imperial Palace later in the day for a state dinner with the emperor and empress, who was in traditional Japanese dress.

But Obama controlled the ball with ease although later admitted he was slightly intimated by the robot

Earlier in the day, the U.S. leader visit the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, where he came face to face with Honda's humanoid robot ASIMO.

The robot, dressed in an astronaut suit went through a series of exercises and told the president it was nice to meet him and that he could kick a soccer ball.

Mr Obama told the droid 'come on then' before it booted the ball towards the president, but he controlled it although later admitted he was slightly intimidated by the robot.

world power.

Today also saw the president assure Japan that America was committed to its defence including the tiny islands at the heart of a row with China.

But the president stopped short of saying he had drawn any new 'red line' and urged peaceful dialogue over the islands, called the Senkaku by Japan and the Diaoyu by China.

Mr Obama also urged Japan to take 'bold steps' to clinch a two-way trade pact seen as crucial to a broad regional agreement

Mr Obama also urged Japan to take 'bold steps' to clinch a two-way trade pact seen as crucial to a broad regional agreement that is a central part of the U.S. leader's 'pivot' of military, diplomatic and economic resources towards Asia and the Pacific.

'We don't take a position on final sovereignty determinations with respect to Senkaku, but historically they have been administered by Japan and we do not believe that they should be subject to change unilaterally and what is a consistent part of the alliance is that the treaty covers all territories administered by Japan,' Obama said.

'This is not a new position, this is a consistent one,' he told a joint news conference after his summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, using the Japanese name for the islands.

'In our discussions, I emphasized with Prime Minister Abe the importance of resolving this issue peacefully,' Obama added.

Obama's stops in Japan will be followed by trips to South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines as part of an Asian tour.

The president cancelled a visit to Asia last year because of the U.S. government shutdown.

The cancellation provided fresh fodder for those in the region who worry that the White House's much-hyped pivot to Asia is continually taking a backseat to other foreign and domestic priorities.

'I think the president will want to make clear that this commitment will be unaffected by developments in Ukraine and other global events," said Jeffrey Bader, Obama's former Asia director.

The president was welcomed to the country by ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy and her husband Edwin Schlossberg

'Countries want to hear that the U.S. presence is in fact steady and strong as China rises.'

While China is not on Obama's eight-day itinerary, leaders in Beijing will be closely watching the president's tour.

Obama's advisers insist the trip - and the White House's broader Asia policy - is not designed counter to China's growing power, and they say the president is not asking Asian nations to choose between allegiance to Washington or Beijing.

On the economic front, Obama is unlikely to have much new to show for efforts to deepen trade ties with Asia.

Negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12 nation free trade pact, are stalled, particularly discussions between the U.S. and Japan over tariffs on agriculture.
