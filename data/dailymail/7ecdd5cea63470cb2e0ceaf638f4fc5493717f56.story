A federal judge today found that the National Security Agency's wholesale collection of millions of Americans' phone records is legal and a valuable part of the nation's arsenal to combat terrorism.

U.S. District Judge William Pauley said in a written opinion that the program ‘represents the government's counter-punch’ to eliminate al-Qaida's terror network by connecting fragmented and fleeting communications.

In ruling, the judge noted the September 11 attacks and how the phone data-collection system could have helped investigators connect the dots before the attacks occurred.

The government learned from its mistake and adapted to confront a new enemy: a terror network capable of orchestrating attacks across the world.

‘It launched a number of counter-measures, including a bulk telephony metadata collection program - a wide net that could find and isolate gossamer contacts among suspected terrorists in an ocean of seemingly disconnected data,’ he said.

Pauley's decision contrasts with a ruling earlier this month by U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon, who granted a preliminary injunction against the collecting of phone records of two men who had challenged the program.

The Washington jurist said the 'almost Orwellian' program likely violates the U.S. Constitution's ban on unreasonable search.

Pauley dismissed a lawsuit brought by 
the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU did not immediately respond
 to a message for comment.

‘We are pleased with the decision,’ Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said.

In
 arguments before Pauley last month, an ACLU lawyer had argued that the 
government's interpretation of its authority under the Patriot Act was 
so broad that it could justify the mass collection of financial, health 
and even library records of innocent Americans without their knowledge.

A government lawyer had countered that counterterrorism investigators wouldn't find most personal information useful.

The ACLU sued earlier this year after former NSA analyst Edward Snowden leaked details of the secret programs that critics say violate privacy rights.

The NSA-run programs pick up millions of telephone and Internet records that are routed through American networks each day.

In a 54-page decision, Pauley said the program 'vacuums up information about virtually every telephone call to, from, or within the United States.'

ut he said the program's constitutionality 'is ultimately a question of reasonableness,' and that there was no evidence that the government had used "bulk telephony metadata" for any reason other than to investigate and disrupt terrorist attacks.

'Technology allowed al Qaeda to operate decentralized and plot international terrorist attacks remotely,' Pauley wrote. 'The bulk telephony metadata collection program represents the government's counter-punch.'

President Barack Obama has defended the surveillance program, but indicated a willingness to consider constraints.

The ACLU had no immediate comment. The White House was not immediately available for comment. A U.S. Department of Justice spokesman said the department is pleased with the decision.

ep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterintelligence & Terrorism, in a statement said Pauley's decision 'preserves a vital weapon for the United States in our war against international terrorism.'
