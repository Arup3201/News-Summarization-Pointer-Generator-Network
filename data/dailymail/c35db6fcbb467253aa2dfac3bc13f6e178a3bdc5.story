An Illinois fourth grader is suing one of his classmates for bullying him over the span of his third grade year.

On Tuesday, Matthew and Deveri 
Del Core filed suit  on behalf of their son Joaquin, naming a classmate identified as 'C.A.' in court papers as well as that boy's parents, the school district, and the principal of Robert Frost Elementary school, Jeffrey Brusso.

Deveri DeL Core claims the district retaliated by firing her from her job in the elementary school's cafeteria just hours after the suit was filed.

Illinois fourth grader Joaquin Del Core is suing one of his classmates for bullying him over the span of his third grade year

Matthew and Deveri Del Core filed the suit on behalf of their son, naming the bully along with the school district and school principal

She told NBC Chicago the given reason was that she was being fired 'at the 
request of the client' over actions she'd taken that had 'been 
detrimental to the physical and mental well-being of students and 
staff.'

While the school declined comment on the termination, district superintendent Kate Hyland said the school's policies on safety were enforced with the rigorous.

'As a district, and at each of our 
schools, we value the safety and security of each and every one of our 
students and staff members, and take bullying prevention very 
seriously,' he wrote in a statement. 'We work diligently to provide a 
healthy, productive environment for all our students to learn and grow.'

Joaquin claims to have been attacked almost weekly, being hit, punched, and kicked as well as receiving more violent threats.

'There was everything from him 
choking my son and threatening to kill him, said he was going to go home
 and get a knife and come back and kill him,' said Deveri Del Core. 'My
 son would wake up at night screaming and crying, terrified, and did not
 want to go to school.'

The parents filed multiple police reports and met with school officials but no progress was made.

They added that the accused bully's parents said the boy had 'anger issues.'

The family claims Joaquin's mother was fired from her school cafeteria job in retaliation for the suit

'The school said they were taking action and assured us
 it wouldn't happen again, and it would just keep happening,' said Joaquin's 
father. '(They would say) 'Yes we'll handle it, rest assuredâ€¦' and
 then it would happen again a week later!'

Attorney Joel Handler said he was seeking monetary damages for the family, with a judgement against even the grade school perpetrator.

'He has committed multiple assaults,
 multiple batteries, on my client,' Handler said. 'Since the school's 
not going to address it, and the parent presumably are not going to 
address it, then we are going to have to address it.'

The young boy's future earnings could even be garnished to recover a judgement.

Family attorney Joel Harden said a judgement could even result in the alleged bully having future wages garnished

'That (potential) judgment is good 
for 20 years,' Handler said. 'As long as we know where he is, we would be 
enforcing the judgment against him.'

Handler plans to amend the complaint to include a charge of retaliatory discharge naming the school for firing Joaquin's mother.

'This isn't just about our son any 
more,' she told reporters. 'This is about the child that's been bullying our son,
 that he gets the help that he needs, and that the school provides it 
for him.'
