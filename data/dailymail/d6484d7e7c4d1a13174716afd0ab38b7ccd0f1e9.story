This is the shocking moment a reckless road rage driver slammed the car's brakes just inches in front of a lorry on the motorway.

Dash-cam footage captured the motorist almost causing a mass pile-up after pulling off the dangerous manoeuvre on the busy M5 motorway.

The driver of the blue Citroen C3 had been jostling for position with the large truck near Frankley Services, in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, in August last year.

The clip begins as the driver starts overtaking the lorry which then immediately pulls into the middle lane behind the car

He can be seen overtaking the lorry which then immediately pulls into the middle lane behind the car between junctions 3 and 4 of the motorway.

Incredibly, the driver then slams on his brakes in front of the 7.5 tonne HGV which only manages to avoid a serious collision by a matter of inches.

The man behind the wheel of the Citroen was tracked down by officers from the Central Motorway Policing Group (CMPG) after the incident.

He admitted one count of dangerous driving and was handed a 12-month driving ban by magistrates as well as a £145 bill for court costs.

The driver - who had his wife in the passenger seat at the time - was also ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work and told he must re-take his driving test.

West Midlands Police today released the 16-second clip which was taken from the dash-cam of the lorry but refused to name the motorist involved.

A spokesman said: 'Unfortunately, the Citroen driver deemed the best way to teach the trucker a lesson was to slam his brakes on in front of the HGV.

'Not only was the driver putting his life on the line, but also that of his wife in the passenger seat and other road users who could have been caught in the ensuing carnage.

'The two vehicles avoided a collision by a matter of inches - as shown in chilling dash-cam footage from the truck - and the Citroen driver later admitted a count of dangerous driving after being shown the footage.'
