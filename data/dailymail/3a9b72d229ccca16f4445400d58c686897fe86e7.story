The number of people buying annuities has fallen by as much as 50 per cent 

Britain's pensions revolution has triggered a collapse in the number of savers buying an annuity.

Financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown revealed that its sales of annuities – an income for life paid by an insurer when you cash in your pension pot – have fallen by more than 40 per cent in just one year.

Aviva and Legal & General said their annuity sales have plunged by 23 per cent and 49 per cent respectively.

From next April, savers will no longer have to buy an annuity to access their cash. Instead, they will be able to take money out whenever they wish.

Figures show the new rules have already caused a huge slowdown in people buying an annuity. 

The shake-up, described by the Chancellor as ‘the most radical changes to pensions in almost 100 years’, comes after annuities have been widely criticised for ripping off customers, with many unwittingly locking themselves into poor deals.

Many signed deals without realising their loved ones would not see a penny of their savings if they died first. 

Alan Higham, retirement director of Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said: ‘People are pausing and thinking: "Should I still do that?"

‘With a £20,000 pension pot, a lot of people are saying: "I’d rather have the £20,000, than an annuity.

"I’ll take £10,000 next year and £10,000 the following year and not pay too much tax on it and do what I want with it."'

Others are simply deciding to postpone their retirement because their partner is not ready to stop work, they enjoy their job or they cannot afford to retire, he added. 

Legal & General recently warned it expects the market to remain ‘subdued with volumes down 50 per cent for 2014 and down a further 50 per cent in 2015.’

The shake-up comes after many savers signed deals which froze out their spouses if they died first. Posed by models 

Hargreaves Lansdown said it sold just 3,319 annuities between January and June this year, compared to 5,650 during the same period last year, a fall of 41 per cent.

A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers said: ‘The Budget was a game changer for savers and this is a year of change for savers too.’

Annuity rates have also fallen sharply in recent years. In 1990, a 65-year-old with a £100,000 pension pot typically retired with an income of £15,640 a year; on today’s market they would get just £6,264.
