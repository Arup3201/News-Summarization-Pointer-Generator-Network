One of the daughters of the man who allegedly kidnapped three girls for 10 years - including her best friend - has called for him to be given the death penalty, MailOnline can reveal.

Arlene Castro said that her father Ariel should be executed for what he did to the women.

The revelations of her father's alleged involvement in Gina DeJesus' disappearance were particularly devastating, as Arlene and Gina were classmates and close friends before she vanished.

Overwhelmed: She said she had no idea that her father was keeping three women locked up in his home

She feels that only the death penalty can make him 'suffer the consequences' for allegedly keeping Gina, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight in captivity for a decade.

MailOnline can also reveal that Ariel's five children have vowed never to visit him in prison because they are so disgusted by him.

They also look away from the TV whenever he comes on because they are outraged that he 'used' them to find his prey.

That the call for Ariel to face the death penalty comes from Arlene is a clear sign of the rage she feels towards her father - but also the guilt at being an unwitting part of his twisted scheme.

if it wasn't for Ariel Castro

Arlene was walking home from school with Gina in 2004 just before she disappeared.

Police
 say Ariel then offered Gina a ride home but instead took him to his 
house in Cleveland, Ohio where she became his slave for the next 10 
years.

Arlene was one of 
four children born to Ariel and first wife Grimilda Figueroa, who died 
last year after years of beatings from him.

Ariel and Grimilda Figueroa lived in 
an apartment in the second floor of Grimilda’s parents’ house for five 
years beginning about 1986.

One of the doors that Ariel shut to 
keep Grimilda away from her parents remained locked for years after they
 left because Ariel took the only key with him, Nancy Figueroa, 
Grimilda’s sister-in-law, said.

Ariel and Grimilda, nicknamed, 
'Nilda,' moved out in 1992 when Ariel bought the house on Seymour Street
 - where he later allegedly held three women against their will for a 
decade.

Ismael Figueroa said he confronted 
Ariel shortly after he moved in with his daughter because he could hear 
the new couple was fighting constantly, but was always locked out from 
checking on his own daughter.

'He abused her, hit her. He was not a good man,’ 75-year-old Mr Figueroa said.

Mr Figueroa said that Ariel worked to separate his daughter from her family almost as soon as they started dating.

Even though she was living in her parents’ house, he said, Ariel would prevent her from seeing her brothers and sisters.

In 1993, Grimilda filed a police report, accusing him of savagely beating her while she was recovering from brain cancer.

She finally took her four children and left him in 1996.

Grimilda died of brain cancer in 
April of last year. Ariel and his two brothers, Pedro and Unil, insisted
 on attending her funeral.

Mr Figueroa was furious.

'He did so much to her. It's disrespectful. And they wouldn’t even take off their hats,' he said.

Grimilda’s sister Elida Caraballo remained close with the children and said that they were unable to comprehend what he had done.

Elida said: 'He used his kids to get to their friends. They feel like they were used just to get to their girls. They're disgusted by it.

'I've spoken to Angie [another of the daughters]. She's traumatized that her dad did this. She's like: 'We're eating dinner and you have those girls in that house?

'You have two faces on. She's like, how could he do that? How? How do you do this? How. Words can't explain how she's feeling.

'Angie says he needs to rot in hell in jail. Rosie [the family name for Arlene] is the one that says death.'

Elida's husband Frank said that Arlene might just be angry at the moment and that they might ‘change their way of thinking’ in the weeks to come, but Elida disagreed.

She said: ‘My niece [Angie] wants him to rot in jail. She wants him to suffer the consequences of what he's done. Angie says that. Rosie says death.

Anguish: Angie Gregg's aunt says that her niece has not yet come to terms with what her father is accused of

'Angie hasn't come to terms with it. She gets up in the morning she's hoping she's in a dream, it's a nightmare.

'Next thing you know, this is real, this is really happening. Just like me, I wake up in the morning and I'm like: 'Oh my god, did this really happen?' And I turn on the TV and it really did.

'It was a shock, it's a shock.

'They're never going to see him, they're never going to see him in there [prison]. If they see him on TV they just turn around. They don't want to see him.'

Arlene has already appeared on TV and apologized to the DeJesus family and said that she really wants to see Gina again.

In a tearful interview on Good Morning America, she said she was ‘embarrassed’ by her father and appalled at his actions.

Angie told CNN's Piers Morgan on Thursday night: 'Everything's making sense now. It's all adding up. And I'm disgusted.'

Castro's son, who is also named Ariel but now goes by Anthony, told MailOnline earlier this week that his father 'doesn't deserve to have his own life anymore.

Torment: Anthony Castro says that his father 'deserves to be behind bars for the rest of his life'

'He deserves to be behind bars for the rest of his life. I'm just thankful they're alive.'

On Wednesday, the mother of Ariel Castro, who was today formally charged with imprisoning three women for a decade, has tearfully apologized for his actions and said she is 'in a lot of pain.'

Lillian Rodriguez spoke to reporters from the window of her car as she left her home, which she shares with her son Pedro, who was also arrested in connection with the kidnappings but who has not been charged.

'I am a mother in a lot of pain,' she said in Spanish. 'I am sorry for what my son has done.'

She added that she is sorry for the mothers of the three women who were allegedly held captive by her son for 10 years.

Locked up: Three missing women were found at this home, owned by Castro, in Cleveland on Monday

Found: Gina DeJesus, left, was just 14 when she 
vanished in 2004, while another alleged victim Amanda Berry, right, was 
16 when she went missing in 2003. Both women were found on Monday

Missing: Michelle Knight, now 32, was also found inside the home, nearly 11 years after she went missing

Ariel has been charged on kidnapping and rape offenses but according to Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty he could face murder charges if he's implicated in the deaths of the victims' unborn children.

These would open up the possibility he will face the death penalty.

Ariel was charged on Thursday with kidnapping and raping Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight after the three were found this week inside his house on Cleveland’s West side after there were kidnapped nearly a decade ago.

He is being held on $8million bail and prosecutors said they will seek the death penalty if they can prove that he forced his captives to have miscarriages.
