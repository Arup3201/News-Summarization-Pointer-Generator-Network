A shameless Hitler fantatic banned from Asda after he went shopping in full Nazi uniform has donned the offensive outfit again to take his dog for a walk in a coat emblazoned with swastikas.

Paul Dutton, 48, spent weeks creating the sheepskin outfit for dog Albert, decorating it with a black Swastika on the back, and an SS logo on the buckle.

The father-of-six even combed the Chinese Crested dog's fur into a curtain style like Adolf Hitler's as he walked the pet in Cambridge.

Unemployed Mr Dutton told The Sun that Albert was a 'Woof-Waffe kind of dog, and that the pair could 'march as Hitler's men' in their matching clothing.

After finishing the coat last month he tweeted: 'Ive just made me dog his own SA coat so he don't feel left out when he goes for a walk lol'.

Outraged Jewish groups have labelled his latest stunt 'offensive'.

In October Mr Dutton was thrown out of his local branch of Asda in Cambridge after horrified shoppers took offence at his Nazi-SS uniform.

Hitler-obsessed Mr Dutton, who has Swastika tattoos on his neck, chest and hands, was seen pushing his baby grandson in a trolley, while dressed in the black uniform, including cap and red Nazi armband.

While a few shoppers in the Asda store treated it as a sick stunt, others immediately complained to staff, who told Mr Dutton to leave.

An unrepentant Mr Dutton went on Twitter later to say he had been using the Asda branch in the Beehive Centre in Cambridge since it opened three years ago and often wore his uniform.

He said he had intended to hand out cards promoting his website, where he writes about his fascination with Adolf Hitler.

Referring to Prince Harry, who had to apologise in 2005 for wearing a Nazi uniform to a fancy dress party as a joke, he added: ‘I got ejected from Asda for wearing something that is good enough for a Prince 2 wear.’

Shopper Rosina Rusin, 60, said: ‘My 
grandmother’s family died in the gas chambers and I thought “Here is 
this bloke parading about”. People’s mouths were falling open.

‘You
 are not going to come out like that unless you want to draw attention 
to yourself. One lady was very upset – she was close to crying.’

Marisa
 Baker, 38, said: ‘I saw the tattoo on his neck and a swastika on his 
hand. It’s not what you want to see, especially as there’s children 
around.

Asda said: ‘We had a number of customer complaints so we asked him to leave the store.’

On
 his website, Mr Dutton says his partner left him after he became 
fascinated with Nazism and claims that Hitler and Eva Braun faked their 
deaths and went on to have children in Argentina. He also uses a quote 
saying that the Holocaust was a ‘necessary evil’.

Mr Dutton, who boasts on his Twitter profile 'I was the Nazi in Asda on Halloween'.
