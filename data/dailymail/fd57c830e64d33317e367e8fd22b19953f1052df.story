A seriously-wounded Army Ranger who was thought to be unconscious has shown an astonishing act of defiance by saluting his senior as he was presented with the Purple Heart in hospital.

John Hargis, from Cincinnati, Ohio, has been hailed an inspiration after his wife uploaded an image to Facebook showing him raising his arm to show respect for the higher-ranking officer.

The touching moment - which his commander called the single greatest event he has witnessed in his 10 years in the Army - came after Hargis underwent surgery in a military hospital in Afghanistan.

He had suffered serious leg injuries after a female suicide bomber detonated her explosives in Panjwai last week, killing four of Hargis' comrades. He was on his fourth tour of Afghanistan.

Honourable: Army Ranger Josh Hargis courageously brought his right hand up to salute during a Purple Heart ceremony at his bedside in intensive care. His comrades thought he was unconscious

Days later as he lay motionless in his hospital bed in intensive care, a simple military ceremony was conducted to honour him with a Purple Heart, an award for his sacrifice to his country.

But to everyone's complete surprise Hargis, who was thought to still be unconscious after the extensive surgery, raised his right hand to salute his commander.

He battled a neck brace, breathing apparatus and tubes and even competed with a doctor who tried to stop him from moving to complete the mark of respect.

The brave and magnanimous gesture brought tears to the eyes of the 50 grown men and soldiers who had gathered in the room to witness the ceremony.

Inspiration: Josh's wife Taylor has shared the picture as it was the commander's hope that newspapers and new channels would publish it to show how he is anÂ  inspiration to the nation

The simple gesture left a lasting poignant memory for the senior officer, who wanted to share the story of Josh's honour and bravery with the world.

A letter from his commmander to his wife, Taylor Hargis, explained the gravitas of the occasion.

'I cannot impart on you the level of emotion that poured through the intensive care unit that day,' he wrote in the letter, which she shared on Facebook.

'Grown men began to weep and we were speechless at a gesture that speak volumes about Josh's courage and character.'

The commander wrote that he believes the picture, which he has hanging above his desk, belongs on every news channel and newspaper, adding he 'will remember it as the single greatest event I have witnessed in my ten years in the Army'.

The ceremony was held just prior to Mr Hargis being flown back to Texas, U.S, via Germany, to receive further treatment.

His mother, Laura Heitman, speaking to ABC Channel5, said her son 'sounded amazing' when he talked with WCPO. 'He was in good spirits,' she said.

She told the news service her 24-year-old Dater High graduate has faced an uphill struggle to join the Army, because of a skiing accident which left him with a broken femur years ago.

But he never gave up hope. she said: 'He was just very determined. He wanted so bad to be a Ranger. After three or four times, he wrote to the Surgeon General and got accepted from the Surgeon General.'

She told ABC Channel 5 that they Rangers asked him to join up right after boot camp: 'It was a great honor.'

Josh was seriously wounded as you know and survived for almost two hours after his injury before arriving to the hospital.

Josh was immediately pushed through a series of surgeries and emerged hours later into an intensive care unit here at our base in Afghanistan.

Despite being in intense pain and mental duress, Josh remained alert and compassionate to the limited Rangers that were allowed to visit him bedside.

Prior to Josh being moved to Germany for his eventual flight to America, we conducted a ceremony to award him with the Purple Heart for wounds received in action.

A simple ceremony, you can picture a room full of Rangers, leaders, doctors, and nurses surrounding his bedside while the Ranger Regimental Commander pinned the Purple Heart to his blanket.

During the presentation the Commander publishes the official orders verbally and leaned over Josh to thank him for his sacrifice.

Josh, whom everybody in the room (over 50 people) assumed to be unconscious, began to move his right arm under the blanket in a diligent effort to salute the Commander as is customary during these ceremonies.

Despite his wounds, wrappings, tubes, and pain, Josh fought the doctor who was trying to restrain his right arm and rendered the most beautiful salute any person in that room had ever see.

I cannot impart on you the level of emotion that poured through the intensive care unit that day. Grown men began to weep and we were speechless at a gesture that speak volumes about Josh's courage and character.

The picture, which we believe belongs on every news channel and every news paper is attached. I have it hanging above my desk now and will remember it as the single greatest event I have witnessed in my ten years in the Army.
