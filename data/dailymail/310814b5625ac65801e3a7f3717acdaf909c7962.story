Icy roads spelled trouble on a Chinese highway when two cars skidded to a halt - and caused a 19-car pile-up.

The two white cars were travelling along an overpass in Wuxi, in Jiangsu Province, China, earlier this month when they sparked the multiple-vehicle accident.

The first car lost control on the ice but the driver appeared to be unable to pull over because of the slippery conditions.

The white cars skidded but the traffic behind could not avoid the hold-up

The number of cars involved soon rose to seven on the overpass Jiangsui Province, China

The second car then caught the back of the first before they both stopped.

The ensuing drama was captured on CCTV - and miraculously, the first car was able to drive away.

Other vehicles weren't so lucky. The footage shows three more drivers approaching the accident scene but unable to swerve to dodge the pile.

The footage, recorded over a two-and-a-half minute period, shows cars skidding so they're facing the wrong way, but left helpless in the face of oncoming traffic, including a bus.

Some drivers tried to leave their vehicles to warn other cars of the chaos ahead at the risk of being hit themselves.

Cars quickly clustered up behind the spot where the first two cars came to blows

Before too long, the ice caused the accident total to climb into double figures - including a bus

The cluster or cars and a bus clogged the road - but traffic behind had nowhere to go
