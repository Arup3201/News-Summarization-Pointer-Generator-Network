A Chinese couple whose sons drowned in a quarry pit are keeping the boys' bodies in a deep freeze until officials explain why they hadn't filled it in. 

The site was excavated to make way for a new road two years ago.

But it was left derelict and now, partially filled with water, it has become a magnet for local children.

Deep freeze: The bodies of Chung, three, and five-year-old Hu, who drowned in a quarry, are being kept in a fridge until their parents receive compensation from the council, which failed to fill in the site in Loudi, China

Playing: The boys had been throwing stones in the water when Chung (right) fell and Hu (left) tried to save him

Despite their parents' warnings, three-year-old Chung and his brother Hu, five, went to throw stones at the site in the Chinese city of Loudi, Hunan province, with two older friends last week, and fell in.

Chung slipped off the side and Hu tried to save him but neither could swim.

Terrified of getting in trouble, the other children ran home.

The boys were found dead several hours later.

Excavated: The quarry was dug out two years ago for a new road but was left derelict and is now water-filled

Distraught: Their mother Wang Libiao, 27, (left and right) and father Cai, 28 (right) are 'inconsolable'

It came just days after another young boy almost drowned in the quarry but was saved by a passing villager.

The boys' father Cai Libiao, 28, and mother Wang, 27, are now appealing for compensation from the council, and an explanation.

Neighbour Shen Pai, 43, said: 'They worshipped their two boys, everything they did was for their children and they just want answers. 

Answers: The couple have been sleeping at the site as they research what led to their sons' premature death

Investigation: The couple vow to keep their sons' bodies until a proper investigation (pictured) is completed

'The council knew this place was dangerous and hadn't acted on the complaints even when a lad almost died a week earlier.' 

So far though the council has declined to say anything and nor have the construction firm that apparently had promised to fill in the quarry.

The parents meanwhile have put their two boys bodies in a fridge filled with ice while they await further news from the site's officials.
