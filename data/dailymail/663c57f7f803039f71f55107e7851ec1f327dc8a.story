In an age where many in Hollywood do all they can to look younger, growing old gracefully can be a tricky process.

But silver fox George Clooney has proved his natural charm yet again by being voted the world’s top MAG – or Man Aging Gracefully.

In a poll of 1,000 people asking which men over 40 had embraced aging the best, 53-year-old Clooney earned top marks for not dyeing his hair and for ‘looking happy in his skin’.

The actor beat 50-year-old Brad Pitt to the top spot, while Johnny Depp, 51, came in third.

Daniel Craig, 44, was the highest-placing Britain in fourth place and Australian heartthrob Hugh Jackman, 45, rounded out the top five.

Colin Firth came in tenth place in the survey, which was conducted by Crown Clinic hair transplant centre in Manchester.

Oscar-winner Matthew McConaughey, 44, Matt Damon, 43, Will Smith, 45 and Sean Penn, 54, were also in the top ten.

Surgeon Asim Shahmalak from the Crown Clinic said: 'Clooney is a worthy winner. He has been a global sex symbol for 20 years and he has just as many female fans now as when he first emerged on ER.

'He has happily embraced middle age and looks just as sexy as a brooding silver fox as he did as a hunky young doctor in his breakthrough role.

'What is striking about the survey is 
that every single MAG has a full head of hair. It's a sad fact but 
nothing ages a man like losing his hair. The survey shows that baldness 
can age a man by as much as 10 years.'

Crown
 Clinic has seen a 25 per cent rise in male transplants in the last five
 years - and said that between 40 and 50 is the most popular age for 
transplants.

Growing numbers
 of men are copying celebrities such as Robbie Williams, Wayne Rooney 
and Embarrassing Bodies star Christian Jessen and going under the knife 
to keep their hair.
