A virus that has been causing severe respiratory illness across the country has for first time been blamed for the death of a four-year-old child.

A medical examiner in Hamiltown Township, New Jersey, has ruled that Eli Waller died last week was a result of enterovirus 68.

The virus - which carries symptoms such as cough, runny nose, sneezing and body aches - has sickened more than 500 people in 43 states and Washington, D.C. - almost all of them children.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier this week that four people infected with the virus had died, but it's unclear what role the virus played in those deaths.

Urging calm: Hamilton Mayor Kelly Yaede addresses the media concerning the death of a Hamilton Township, preschooler from enterovirus 68 on Saturday October 4, 2014. The mayor said New Jersey wull continue to follow the necessary protocols in order to prevent the spread of the virus

Scene: On September 25, four-year-old Eli Waller from New Jersey, who attended preschool at Yardville Elementary School, died from Enterovirus 68

Widespread:From mid-August to October 3, 2014, CDC or state public health laboratories have confirmed a total of 538 people in 43 states and the District of Columbia with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68

Tragic: Emily Otrando, a 10-year-old from Cumberland, Rhode Island, died September 22 at Hasbro Children's Hospital. She was infected with EV-D68, but died from a bacterial infection that hit her in tandem with the virus

Some children are especially vulnerable to infection because of pre-existing conditions, though the medical examiner said that was not the case in the New Jersey boy's death.

Eli Waller, who attended Yardville Elementary School in Hamilton, died at his home on September 25. 

Most of the severe cases nationwide have involved children because they generally have not been exposed to enteroviruses as often as adults have and are less likely to have developed immunity to them, officials say.

Township officials said the boy's parents have asked for privacy.

'When you're given the news that a virus was the cause of death to your child, of course they were saddened, even more so because they won't get the answers or closure they need,' Mayor Kelly Yaede said.

"The mother said, `We will never find out where he contracted this.'" 

The virus was also found in four other patients who died in September, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC declined to release any other details about those deaths.

Emily Otrando, a 10-year-old from Cumberland, Rhode Island, died September 22 at Hasbro Children's Hospital. 

The  child's death was the result of a bacterial infection, Staphylococcus aureus, that hit the girl in tandem with the virus, Rhode Island officials said in a statement.

They called it 'a very rare combination', and stressed that most people who catch the virus experience little more than a runny nose and low-grade fever.

The child was in good health before she developed severe breathing problems and her parents called 911, said Dr. Michael Fine, director of the Rhode Island Department of Health.

'Very quickly after they got to the hospital, things became dire,' Fine said at a news conference.

This enterovirus germ is not new.

It was first identified in 1962 and has caused clusters of illness before. 

Because it's not routinely tested for, it may have spread widely in previous years without being identified in people who just seemed to have a cold.

This year, the virus has gotten more attention because it has been linked to hundreds of severe illnesses. 

Beginning last month, hospitals in Kansas City, Missouri, and Chicago have received a flood of children with trouble breathing. 

Some needed oxygen or more extreme care such as a breathing machine. Many, but not all, had asthma before the infection.

Germ: Enterovirus EV-D68 is uncommon but not new and causes prominent respiratory symptoms, like a cold but worse. There's no vaccine for EV-D68

Sick: 13-year-old Will Cornejo is recovering at Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children at Presbyterian/St. Luke's Medical Center in Denver on September 5 from human enterovirus 68 that has come to Colorado

Health officials say they have not detected a recent mutation or other change in the virus that would cause it to become more dangerous.

The government says enterovirus 68 has sickenedover 500 people in 42 states and the District of Columbia.

Almost all have been children.

Health officials are also investigating whether the virus played a role in a cluster of 10 Denver-area children who have suffered muscle weakness and paralysis.
