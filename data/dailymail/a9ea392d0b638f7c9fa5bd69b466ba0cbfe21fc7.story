Kate Moss could soon be partying in the Highlands at a hotel owned by the man behind royal favourites Mahiki and Whiskey Mist, it has been reported.

Kate's model-turned-nutritionist bestfriend Rose Ferguson, whose daughters were bridesmaids at the star's wedding to Jamie Hince, is said to be set to host her birthday bash at the high-end Craigellachie.

Other A-listers claimed to have been invited to the 19th Century Scottish retreat next month, include Liam and Noel Gallagher, the Times reported.

The hotel is owned by millionaire entrepreneur Piers Adam, whose exclusive London nightclubs have been frequented by Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Mr Adam, who was Guy Ritchie's best-man at the film wedding to Madonna, bought the Craigellachie in October last year after he fell in love with the 28-bedroom mansion while visiting with his father three years ago.

Following the purchase, he is said to have spent up to £3 million refurbishing the traditional fishing and hunting lodge, built in 1893, to its former glory.

The hotel's general manager Kevin Smith told the Times they have 'a lot of famous faces booked for next year.' 

Mr Adam's famously offered Prince George a lifetime membership to his Mayfair venue Mahiki following his birth in July 2013.

Adam's also owns a ski chalet-themed club, Bobo's Schloss, with business partner Nick House and Prince Harry's schoolfriend Thomas van Straubenzee close to Kensington Palace.
