Today show hosts Matt Lauer and Al Roker have followed every move of Sochi's Olympians throughout their hard work - and today they decided to see what it was like to relax like them, too.

In a hilarious segment that aired on Today on Wednesday, the duo took a trip to Russian baths where they were treated to steam baths and oil massages while wearing a series of fetching hats designed to protect their heads from the heat.

As they walked to a collection of small 
huts overlooking the Russian mountains, Lauer said: 'We've partied like 
Olympians, we've had swagger like Olympians, now it's time to chill out 
like Olympians.'

But it wasn't all relaxing: they also endured a beating with eucalyptus leaves, which is supposed to improve circulation, release toxins and ward of illnesses.

Ouch! Today show hosts Al Roker, left, and Matt Lauer, right, were beaten with eucalyptus leaves at a Russian baths on Wednesday. Lauer called the painful-looking experience 'recreational spanking'

First, the men donned their felt hats and laid down on beds, where their backs were rubbed with oil.

'Do you have three hands?' Roker asked his masseur. 'It feels like there's more than two things going on right now.'

The two men then grimaced as the leaves, which had been dipped in hot water, were whacked across their backs.

'That tingles!' Roker whispered.

Lauer quipped: 'I'm not sure how much more of the recreational spanking I can take.'

Bliss: Roker said he loved the experience at the baths and claimed it cured a sore shoulder

Sore: But Lauer said he was left with a rash that Roker said resembled tartare. The men were instructed to wear fetching felt hats, designed to protect their heads from the intense heat

Violent: The popular treatment is supposed to improve circulation, remove toxins and ward off illness

Sore, they then headed to a large steam bath where hot water was poured on their bodies and a bunch of leaves were placed on top of their heads.

Lauer leaned back, saying, 'Now we can relax like Olympians.'

'By making Matt and Al soup,' Roker added.

As the segment aired on Wednesday's show, the men said the Russian baths had been a great experience, while the crowd cheered for their hats.

'It was fun at the time,' Lauer said. 'But afterwards it left a bit of a mark on my back.'

Hot work: The Today duo also 'relaxed' in a steaming bath which Roker called 'Matt and Al soup'

Not convinced: Roker howled as hot water was poured over his head, while Lauer stayed camouflaged

But Roker, who said the treatment cured a sore shoulder, was more convinced.

'I loved it,' he said. 'My shoulder feels fantastic. But Matt has a rash on his back, it's pretty grim... I've seen tartare that looks better than that.'

The pair are in Sochi for the Olympics along with fellow Today show hosts Savannah Guthrie, Jenna Bush Hager and Natalie Morales.

Lauer has also been covering for NBC sportscaster Bob Costas while he battles an eye infection.

Matt Lauer and Al Roker endured a beating with leaves, a popular and centuries-old treatment carried out at Russian baths.

Temperatures inside the baths - knowns as a banya - can often reach more than 200F (93C) so felt hats are worn to protect the head from the heat.

Then leaves from oak, white birch or eucalyptus trees are covered with hot water before they are smacked across the body repeatedly.

The treatment is supposed to improve circulation while also removing dead skin and toxins. It is also believed that the massage - called a venik - releases phytoncides which stall pathogens.

Different types of leaves are believed to help with different ailments. Birch, for example, is supposed to help wounds heal faster, while oak is believed to be good for blood pressure.
