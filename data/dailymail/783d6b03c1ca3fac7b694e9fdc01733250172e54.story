A clarinet player developed a rare form of pneumonia because he failed to clean his clarinet for 30 years

A clarinet player developed a rare form of pneumonia because he failed to clean his instrument for 30 years.

The unnamed 68-year-old man from Atlanta, U.S., suffered from ‘saxophone lung’ for a year.

The condition is an allergic reaction to a fungus that grows inside wind instruments.

It causes symptoms including wheezing and coughing and symptoms will continue until the instrument is cleaned.

Dr Marissa Shams, from the Emory University Adult Asthma, Allergy and Immunology Clinic, explained that the man was having an allergic reaction to mould inside the instrument, NBC News reports.

Dr Shams, who presented the case at the annual meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, explained that the man was playing his clarinet several nights a week and that each time he was breathing in the fungus.

The patient’s symptoms did not respond to inhalers, steroids or antibiotics so doctors initially thought he was suffering from an excessive immune response to a fungus called Aspergillus.

However, when they heard about his clarinet playing they carried out a chest X-ray that revealed his lungs were full off mucus and blockages.

They then discovered he was allergic to two fungi and that the reed of his clarinet was contaminated with another mould – Exophiala.

‘There was very impressive fungal growth on those,’ Dr Shams told NBC News.

She added that once he had been given more oral steroids and cleaned his clarinet, his health improved dramatically.

This clarinet player is not the first to suffer the ill effects of a dirty instrument.

Doctors discovered the man was allergic a fungus - Exophiala (pictured) - that the reed of his clarinet was contaminated with. Once he had sterilised the instrument, he recovered rapidly

In March, an English bagpiper, John Shone, 78, told how he nearly died after picking up a lung infection from his bagpipes.

It is believed germs can survive for hours, or even days, on wind instruments that are not cleaned.

As a result, experts recommend that they are regularly sterilised.
