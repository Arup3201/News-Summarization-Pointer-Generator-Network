Students who use social networking sites to confess about their boozing and bed-hopping have been warned it could leave them unemployable.

Undergraduates have been swapping tales of binge-drinking and lewd behaviour on the social networking site Facebook, leading academic chiefs to warn their racy anecdotes could damage their future job prospects.

The craze for online confession pages has swept the country with students often using them to brag about their extra-curricular activities.

Warning: Students have been posting confessions of binge-drinking and bed-hopping on the internet for all to see

But one Facebook site, Swansea Uni Confessions, has been slammed by the university and its student union.

In a joint statement, registrar Raymond Ciborowski and students union president Tom Upton said: 'We are seriously concerned about the nature and content of these pages.

'Irresponsible use of social media can damage their future employment prospects as companies are increasingly searching for information on job applicants.'

Undergraduates use the Facebook pages to post tales of what they get up to after moving away from home.

Most of the confessions are anonymous as students e-mail their stories to an unknown administrator who then posts them on the internet for everyone to see.

But concerns have been raised over what these shady administrators might do with students information after the messages have been sent.

Warning: University bosses and the students' union have been moved to issue a joint statement to warn against using the Facebook site Swansea Uni Confessions

The joint statement added: 'Students are sharing personal information, including explicit content, with an anonymous page administrator, who has no accountability.

'As a result, participantsâ€™ personal details could potentially be made publicly available for viewing by fellow students, staff, public, press, potential employers.

'University regulations clearly state that it is a disciplinary offence to engage in behaviour which could bring the university into disrepute - this includes social media activity.

'The internet and social media are governed by laws relating to defamation and public order, and as a result, there is no such thing as absolute freedom of speech.'
