A woman watched her boyfriend rape and shout names at the lifeless body of a student she had brought over to be a sex offering, she has revealed in her court testimony.

Kathryn McDonough resumed testimony on Wednesday in the murder trial of ex-boyfriend Seth 
Mazzaglia, who is charged with killing Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott at his
 Dover, New Hampshire apartment in October 2012.

After being rebuffed twice by the 19-year-old University of New Hampshire student, Mazzaglia crept up behind her as she watched a movie with McDonough and quickly incapacitated her with a rope before raping her, McDonough told the court.

Afterwards he ordered her to hold the white rope - which he and McDonough had used in their sex games - around the already-motionless girl's neck, she said, and she did as she was told.

crying during testimony in the murder trial of her ex-boyfriend, who she
 says strangled and raped her co-worker in 2012. She said she watched as
 he did it

Breakdown: The judge called a break when McDonough's sobs became uncontrollable during the trial

McDonough is serving a 
prison sentence for lying to investigators about the teen's 
disappearance.

On Tuesday, she testified how she had lured Marriott, her co-worker, to the apartment with the promise of watching a movie or playing a video game.

In reality, McDonough testified, she was offering Marriott as a sex partner for Mazzaglia, who was angry that McDonough had left him alone for 12 days.

Mazzaglia sent her a text message at 10:26 p.m. asking, 'We painting tonight?' - a coded reference to having sex with Marriott.

She replied: 'Your decision, I guess. If you have a plan. Nervous.'

'I didn't really know what he wanted to do,' McDonough testified.

After a game of strip poker, Mazzaglia suggested to Marriott that she kiss McDonough.

When Marriott said no, saying she was in a committed relationship, he said he wanted the college student to watch McDonough and Mazzaglia have sex. Marriott again refused.

McDonough, who previously told the jury about the couple's sadomasochistic relationship, testified that Mazzaglia was unaccustomed to hearing 'no'.

'That's when he moved up behind her and he pulled the rope up over her head and he strangled her,' she said. 'She let out a quick noise and she sort of stopped. Her arms curled up against her chest and her eyes were closed.'

Mazzaglia was wearing gloves and had a soft, white cotton rope the couple used in bondage sex. After Mazzaglia strangled Marriott, McDonough went into the bathroom.

When she returned to the main part of the studio apartment, she saw Mazzaglia raping Marriott and calling her names - her motionless body prone on the floor.

Then Mazzaglia went into the bathroom and told McDonough to hold the rope around Marriott's neck. McDonough said she laid the rope loosely over Marriott's neck.

'Her mouth opened a tiny bit,' McDonough testified. 'I only noticed because I was so close to her.'

She testified, voice quavering, that she checked for a pulse and found none. Neither she nor Mazzaglia called police or an ambulance.

Marriott's father, Bob Marriott, sat in the front row, his shoulders heaving with silent sobs as McDonough testified in a monotone about his daughter's last minutes.

As prosecutors projected a timeline of events on a screen, McDonough started sobbing. The judge called a break and she was escorted from the courtroom, still sobbing and trembling.

On Tuesday, she had explained she had taken Marriott to their apartment because Mazzaglia had demanded she find him a sex partner as punishment for leaving him alone for 12 days while she went to camp.

McDonough
 said he had brutally sodomized her a month earlier as 'punishment' for 
failing to find him a sex 'slave' so she was willing to 'try and please 
him' however she could.

'I 
think it would be fitting if the first thing you saw me do when you got 
back is pleasure one of your friends until they died of orgasms and only
 then turned my brutal attention to you,' Mazzaglia allegedly wrote in a
 text message he sent to McDonough.

Missed: Marriott, pictured left and right with her parents, had gone to McDonough's house to watch a movie

She added that Mazzaglia wanted her to recruit Marriott as the slave because of her physique and personality, SeaCoastOnline reported.

McDonough, 20, is the key witness against her ex and lawyers on both sides cast her differently.

Prosecutors
 portray her as the sexual submissive, dominated in all aspects of their
 relationship by a man 10 years older than her, but Mazzaglia's lawyers 
say she was the dominatrix, a woman obsessed with finding another woman 
to dominate, and it was Mazzaglia who was her sexual slave.

Marriott had transferred to the 
University of New Hampshire only weeks earlier to major in marine 
biology. She was a commuter student, living with her aunt and uncle in 
Chester during the week and returning home to Westborough most weekends.

Marriott had been in a committed relationship with Brittany Atwood, who lived in Massachusetts.

On
 the night she died, Marriot text messaged Atwood minutes before 9pm to 
let her know she was going over to 'Kat's' to watch a movie. Atwood 
testified she was happy for her because she was finally making new 
friends.

The text message was Marriott's last communication.

Sick: McDonough, pictured as she is escorted out of the courtroom during the morning break in her former boyfriend's trial, told the court that she watched as the 19-year-old was strangled with a rope

Atwood said became worried the next morning when she had not heard from Marriott and contacted her parents.

Mazzaglia
 told investigators he and McDonough had used Marriott's 2001 Mazda to 
take her body to Peirce Island in Portsmouth, where they threw it and 
her cellphone into the Piscataqua River.

The
 pair then drove Marriott's car to UNH, left it in a student lot and 
discarded her belongings in trash bins, authorities allege.

McDonough is serving a 1-1/2 to three-year sentence for conspiracy and hindering prosecution.

Defense
 attorney Joachim Barth told jurors during his opening statement that 
McDonough bargained her concocted story of what happened that night in 
exchange for time off her sentence, and that testifying against 
Mazzaglia is part of her plea deal.
