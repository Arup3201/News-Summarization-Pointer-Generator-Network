An unfinished overpass collapsed in the Brazilian World Cup host city of Belo Horizonte on Thursday, killing at least two people and casting a shadow over a tournament that has suffered repeated construction accidents and delays.

The bridge, located about two miles from the Mineirao Stadium where World Cup games are being played, collapsed as vehicles were passing on a busy road underneath.

Part of a passenger bus was crushed and another car was still trapped in the wreckage hours later.

The collapsed bridge stretched over 
one of the major thoroughfares connecting the stadium area with the 
international airport. It was part of a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system 
that officials had promised would be ready for the World Cup.

Groups of people gathered around the scene of the accident, some shouting furiously.

'This
 is the incompetence of our authorities and our businesses,' said 
Leandro Brito, 23, a bank worker. 'Because of the World Cup they sped 
everything up to finish faster. That's why this tragedy has happened. 
They are not making things properly. Everyone is very angry.'

Heavy
 government spending on the World Cup, and long delays building 
infrastructure projects, spurred violent street protests across Brazil 
over the past year, although they have died down in recent weeks and the
 tournament has gone more smoothly than many fans and government 
officials had expected.

Still,
 several projects were plagued by fatal construction accidents. Eight 
workers died building stadiums in the 12 cities that have hosted games.

Via Twitter on Thursday, President Dilma Rousseff offered her government's assistance to local authorities if needed.

'In this moment of pain, I offer my solidarity to the families of the victims,' she said.

There
 were conflicting reports over the casualties of the accident in Belo 
Horizonte, which has already hosted five World Cup games and has the 
semi-final match on Tuesday.

Worry: Police fear more bodies could be trapped underneath the collapsed structure

Rushed: According to witnesses, workmen were removing the iron structure surrounding the concrete viaduct when the road suddenly collapsed

Heatbreaking: Estate agent Rogerio Alves, 37,  said: 'It was a terrifying thing. I still can't believe what I saw'

The
 city's fire department confirmed one death and 19 injuries, Lieutenant 
Colonel Edgard Estevo said. A health department spokesman earlier said 
two people had died but later said one of the deaths had not yet been 
confirmed.

Work on the 
network of bus corridors, financed with more than 1 billion reais ($450 
million) in federal funds, began in 2010 and was supposed to finish in 
May.

Downtown portions of the BRT network are running during the World Cup, but long stretches are still under construction.

The
 cause of the accident, the worst since the month-long tournament began 
on June 12, was unclear and no workers were known to be on the overpass 
when it fell.

Rescue operations continued under floodlights, and officials had not been able to reach one of the trapped cars.

Rebuild: The unfinished overpass collapsed on vehicles in Brazil's southeastern World Cup city of Belo Horizonte, killing at least two people and injuring 19, officials said

'We cannot reach the vehicle; we don't know how many victims there are and there could still be someone alive,' Estevo said.

GloboNews
 TV showed video of bloodied passengers of the bus staggering away from 
the wreckage, screaming. Later, pictures near the scene showed people 
holding signs that said, 'This is the reality of the Cup" and "World Cup
 disaster: put it on Fifa's bill.'

Last month a worker died after a 90-tonne beam fell during the construction of a monorail train project in Sao Paulo.

The teams set to face each other in the competition's quarter finals who could play in the match are France or Germany against the hosts Brazil or Colombia.

Argentina, Belgium, Holland and Costa Rica make up the other teams in the tournament.

The incident was about three miles from the Minas Tennis Club where the British Olympic and Paralympic teams will have their training base ahead of the Rio 2016 Olympics.

 incident happened close to the Mineirao football stadium in Belo 
Horizonte that earlier this week played host to the round of 16 football
