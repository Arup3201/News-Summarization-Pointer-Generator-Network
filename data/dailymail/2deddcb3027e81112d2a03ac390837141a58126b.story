Marco Reus, Ilkay Gundogan, Fabio Coentrao, Paul Pogba and Arturo Vidal are among the names in circulation at Manchester United.

They are the kind of reinforcements David Moyes will need if United are to challenge once again for the Barclays Premier League title.

Aside from their wage demands, here are the two questions they will be asking of United’s chief executive Ed Woodward:

Crucial duo: Whether United sign anyone could depend on Robin van Persie (left) and Wayne Rooney

Turin talent: United have been watching Juventus midfield pair Paul Pogba (left) and Arturo Vidal

The fact that neither question can be answered by Moyes or Woodward is hardly a great selling point for one of the biggest clubs in world football.

Without satisfactory answers to either of those questions, it is impossible for a top player to consider signing for Manchester United.

In the last five seasons, Rooney has scored 85 goals in 137 Premier League appearances. Over the same period Van Persie has 90 in 128 in the league.

If Rooney and Van Persie are not in the team, then United cannot hope to win a competitive Premier League, let alone the Champions League.

Let’s be honest, Reus and Gundogan - who played in Borussia Dortmund’s midfield in last season's European Cup final - won’t fancy threading balls into the path of Javier Hernandez.

Decent enough player, but Reus and Gundogan, who scored Dortmund’s equaliser in the final against Bayern Munich, operate on a different level: inside the Westfalenstadion they rely on Robert Lewandowski.

Rooney and Van Persie are on the same wavelength, elite players who are capable of turning games with a twist of their hips and a finish to match.

Can Pogba, who left United for Juventus in controversial circumstances two years ago, or Vidal really rely on the fading talents of Antonio Valencia or the inconsistency of Ashley Young on either wing? Probably not.

Realistically, this United team is all about Rooney and Van Persie.

Rooney, who earns £250,000 a week, is coming up 10 years as a United player. His future at Old Trafford is far from certain.

There is nothing scheduled to discuss terms on a revised contract that will expire in less than 18 months.

Since the interest from Chelsea last 
summer, there has been nothing to suggest that Rooney will commit his 
long-term future to United.

It is still possible that the United forward, who has been in Egypt with his family recovering from injury, will leave in the summer.

There is, of course, an argument that United must cash in at the end of the season to prevent him walking away on a free transfer in the June 2015.

The practicality is that United wrote off his transfer valuation five years after he was signed from Everton for 2004. Anything they get from here is a bonus.

To meet accounting standards, the £28m United paid for him was amortised between 2004, when he left Goodison Park, and 2009. 

So, anything United 
get for Rooney from here is good business because his transfer fee
 from Everton was effectively written off five years ago.

Left back on the agenda: Fabio Coentrao, here training with Cristiano Ronaldo, is a long-term United target

Rooney is one issue for incoming players and Van Persie, especially his continued absence from the United team, is another.

We
 have been here before with Van Persie when he was at Arsenal, when 
injuries disrupted the early periods of his career in north London.

He has only played two full seasons in the Premier League since his move to England from Feyenoord in the summer of 2004. 

Two years ago, when he was elevated to the role of captain at Arsenal, he played in every league game and scored 30 goals.

Last
 season at United, when he won the title in his first season at Old 
Trafford, he scored 26 times in 38 Premier League appearances.

Now he is sidelined with niggling injuries and no-one, including Moyes, knows when he will return.

Van
 Persie, who is captain of the Holland team who will be appearing at the
 World Cup in Brazil this summer, has not played since December 10.

His
 last goal was against Arsenal, the winner at Old 
Trafford on Novemer 10 after 27 minutes.

Watching brief: Moyes ran the rule over Pogba and Vidal in Juve's weekend match at Cagliari

This may be unfounded, but it doesn’t feel as though he has the same appetite for the game now that he finally has a Premier League medal.

For someone struggling with groin and toe injuries, he has been out of the game for a long time. His return date is unspecified.

Him and Rooney are the two players that can make a difference when it comes to lifting silverware at the end of a season.

Without them, United simply don't have the same appeal.

Manchester United need to decide on Wayne Rooney's future now

@highlight

Without him and Robin van Persie they won't be in the Premier League race

@highlight

Marco Reus and Paul Pogba may not be interested if they leave United

@highlight

It could be best for the club to cash in on Rooney as soon as possible
