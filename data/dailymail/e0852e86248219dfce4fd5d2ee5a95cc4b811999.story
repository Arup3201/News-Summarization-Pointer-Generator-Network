It is a problem common to Sunday League football pitches up and down the country. 

But for one player in a Christian league, his objection to dog dirt on the turf forced him to take an early bath. 

Lance Perry was given his marching orders while representing Rowley College in the West Midlands Christian Football League after warning his team mates about 'dog s***' on the pitch. 

The Christian league has a zero tolerance policy on swearing, so the referee brandished a red card and sent Perry from the field.

A footballer in a Christian league was sent off after he warned his team mates about 'dog s***' on the pitch 

The player's well-intentioned warning came in a bottom of the table clash against St Thomas Aldridge and the referee's actions took both sets of players by surprise. 

Rowley boss Pete Bennett said: 'The league does have a zero policy to foul language and referees can sometimes interpret that rather crazily.

'We couldn't believe it when the red card came out. He protested as far as he could.'

Birmingham County FA has now wiped the record clean and dropped a one-match ban after being informed the expletive was not a critique of the referee.

Disciplinary boss Mike Fellows said: 'We have looked at the words used, and the way they were used.

'Obviously if the response had followed a question about how the ref was performing, the red card would have stayed.

'Actually, s**t is in the Oxford English Dictionary. Clearly in this case the word was not used as a term of abuse.

'However fully support the stance of the West Midlands Christian Football League in their zero tolerance to foul and abusive language.

'A considerable amount of their teams play in public parks. For users of these park and their families, it's the last thing they would want to hear.'

The player raised a problem common to many Sunday League teams, but his language earned him an early bath (stock image)

Despite Perry's absence, Rowley College (who play in black and red stripes) romped to a 5-1 win, which leaves them three off the bottom of the division. 

Boss Bennett added: 'Thankfully common sense has prevailed. In fairness, the league has been very good.'

The West Midlands Christian Football League was formed in 1979 and features both Christian and non-Christian players.

Its mission statement says it exists to allow men to play in a league 'that is morally, decently and ethically sound of action and speech, and is honouring to the name of Jesus Christ.'
