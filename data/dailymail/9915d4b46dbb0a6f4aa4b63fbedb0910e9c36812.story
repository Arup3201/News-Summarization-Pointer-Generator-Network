Marksmen will begin culling thousands of badgers today amid a huge police operation to prevent disruption from protesters who plan to overrun killing sites.

Officers are braced for violent clashes between farmers and animal rights campaigners who will launch patrols this morning.

Activists even plan to abuse health and safety rules by storming into cull sites, forcing shooters to hold their fire.

Jay Tiernan of campaign group Stop the Cull said: ‘We will not have to stand between the guns and the badgers. Health and safety rules mean they will not shoot when people are nearby.’

Police today said a cull protester had been arrested after allegedly trying to break in to a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs site.

A police helicopter and three police cars were called after the protester, thought to be Mr Tiernan, tried to enter the site in Gloucestershire.

The cull is an attempt to tackle bovine tuberculosis, which is transmitted by badgers and has led to the death of 305,000 cattle in the UK over the past decade.

Farmers believe a cull is the only way to protect their livelihood – but the government scheme has been met with opposition from animal rights groups and a number of celebrities, including Brian May and Dame Judi Dench.

Officers
are expected to be out in force for the cull, especially following the 
disruption caused recently by anti-fracking protesters in West Sussex.

The
police operation, which will reportedly cost £4million, will see 
officers brought in from neighbouring counties, while private security 
firms will also be drafted in to help keep the peace.

The
past 15 years has seen a boom in bovine TB as it has spread to cattle 
from badgers, which urinate on grass that is then eaten by cows.

The
disease has ruined farmers’ livelihoods and cost the taxpayer 
£500million over the past decade in research costs, testing and 
compensation payments.

It is believed the problem will cost a further £1billion over the next ten years, and may not be eradicated for another 25 years.

Over the course of a trial that begins today, as many as 5,000 badgers will be killed across 58 square miles of Gloucestershire and Somerset.

The scheme will continue every year for the next four years, and is predicted to cut bovine TB by 16 per cent.

Last week the National Farming Union was granted an injunction in the High Court barring anti-cull activists from approaching farmers’ homes and business premises and cull sites. 

Animal rights groups say the authorities should vaccinate cattle and badgers instead of killing them.
