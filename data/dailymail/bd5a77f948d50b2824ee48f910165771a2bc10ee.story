Former Everton and England left-back Ray Wilson's World Cup winner's medal is set to fetch more than £100,000 at auction.

The medal, which was awarded after England's 1966 win against West Germany, is inscribed with the words: 'FIFA. World Championship Winners, Jules Rimet Cup, Ray Wilson, In England, 1966'. 

It is the second time the medal has been put up for sale after it was previously sold for £80,750 in 2002.

But it is now expected to go for more than £100,000 when it goes under the hammer on November 11.

Graham Budd, of Graham Budd Auctions, who are listing the sale, said it was an 'increasingly rare opportunity' to acquire a piece of English football history.

He said: 'This presents an increasingly rare opportunity to acquire a World Cup winner's medal from England's heroes of 1966.

'Many other examples are now in museums, private collections or highly unlikely ever to be released onto the open market by the player or his family.'

England beat West Germany in front of 98,000 at Wembley Stadium to win their first and only World Cup to date.

The team included goalkeeper Gordon Banks, midfielder Nobby Stiles, Jack Charlton in defence, captain Bobby Moore and Jimmy Greaves and Geoff Hurst up front.

Hurst scored a hat-trick that prompted the famous line from commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme -'They think it's all over, it is now'.

Ray Wilson was in Alf Ramsey's World-Cup winning squad the same year he helped Everton to victory in the FA Cup 

Derbyshire-born Ray Wilson's skills as a left-back were first spotted by a scout at Huddersfield Town and Wilson signed professional forms at the Yorkshire club in 1952.

Wilson made 266 League appearances for Huddersfield, and had been capped 30 times for England - a record for Huddersfield Town.

He moved to Everton in 1964, but a torn muscle meant that he missed most of the 1964-65 season.

By comparison 1965-66 proved to be the highlight of his career. 

He made Alf Ramsey's 1966 England squad after helping Everton to F.A. Cup glory against Sheffield Wednesday in the same year.  

He played in all six games during England's World Cup winning campaign and the semi-final against Portugal marked Wilson's 50th international cap.

At 32, he was also the oldest member of the team that beat West Germany 4-2 in the final on July 30. 

After the World Cup, Alf Ramsey continued to select Wilson as England progressed through the qualification process for the 1968 European Championships.

They went out in the semi-finals and Wilson's 63rd and final England cap came in the third-place play-off against the USSR.

At club level, Wilson appeared at another F.A. Cup final in 1968, but this time, Everton lost to West Bromwich Albion.

Injuries began to take their toll and he was granted a free transfer by Everton in 1969. 

After a season at Oldham and another at Bradford City, he retired in 1971 following a brief spell as caretaker manager.

Wilson then left the world of football completely and built up a successful undertaker's business in Huddersfield. 

Wilson, now 79, lives in Slaithwaite near Huddersfield with his wife Pat. They have two children.
