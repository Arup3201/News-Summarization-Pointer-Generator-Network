Dr Chitra Bharucha is a former vice-chairman of the BBC Trust

A former pressure group chairman and an ex-member of the BBC Trust who was involved in an expenses row were yesterday handed key roles in the Government’s Press Royal Charter.

The two quangocrats – Elizabeth France and Dr Chitra Bharucha – have served on at least 17 public bodies between them.

The only member of the Appointments Committee with any knowledge of the newspaper and magazine industry – former Scottish Media Group chief executive Andrew Flanagan – is a chartered accountant, not a journalist.

The committee, which will appoint the chairman and members of a Recognition Panel, is headed by Dame Anne Pringle, a 35-year career civil servant and former ambassador to Moscow.

Mrs France was appointed the first chairman of the UK Public Affairs Council in 2010 – a pressure group set up to represent the lobbying industry. Its intention was to dissuade the Government from setting up a statutory register of lobbyists by establishing a voluntary list of their activities. However, it was dogged by repeated ‘delays and inaccuracies’ in its work.

Dr Bharucha, a former vice-chairman of the BBC Trust, was among four trustees who were heavily criticised in 2008 for spending £20,000 of licence-payers’ money to take a group of ‘opinion-formers and stakeholders’ to Wimbledon.

In 2010 it was disclosed that she included a claim for £175 to cover the cost of seven months of her Sky TV subscription.

The Government’s Royal Charter, was approved by the Queen at the end of October, but since then not a single newspaper or magazine has said it will sign up.

In November, Culture Secretary Maria Miller told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show the Royal Charter could become redundant if the industry’s new watchdog, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, proved to be successful.

Tory MP Philip Davies said the Royal Charter process was now a ‘farce’. He added: ‘I’ve no idea what qualifies these people to be world-leading authorities.

From the Government that was committed to abolishing quangos we have got ourselves a completely pointless quango.’

A newspaper industry source said: ‘These appointments will do very little to reassure the public or the Press that the Government’s Recognition Panel will be properly independent.

'The mindset of those involved is illustrated by the fact that each of the biographies of the new committee members issued by the Public Appointments Commissioner is helpfully labelled “unclassified”.’
