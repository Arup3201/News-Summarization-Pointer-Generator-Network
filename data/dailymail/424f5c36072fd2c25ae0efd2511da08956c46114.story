Deep in the Hundred Acre Wood just a short walk from the bridge where the beloved characters played Poohsticks – two houses are on the market to give fans the chance to own a little piece of Pooh corner.

Lone Oak Cottage and Lone Oak Hall are hidden away in Ashdown Forest, the 'enchanted' woods' immortalised by AA Milne's classic children's stories about Winnie the Pooh and his animal friends.

But fans of Pooh, Piglet, Tigger and Eeyore will have to fork out £2.75million if they want to get their hands on both unique properties, located in their own private-gated hamlet in the woodlands in East Sussex.

Even though you're unlikely to stumble across the 'bear of very little brain' in the woods, all the famous landmarks from the best-selling books can be found only a short stroll away.

Lone Oak Cottage has an asking price of £895,000 - or it could be bought along with Loan Oak Hall as one 2.7 acre plot for £2.75million

The luxury houses can be bought as one 2.7 acre plot, or buyers can purchase them separately - Lone Oak Hall has a price tag of £1.95million while Lone Oak Cottage is £895,000.

Five-bedroom Lone Oak Hall is a modern 4,227 sq ft home with four floors boasting a swimming pool, a garden room, drawing room with terrace and an office.

It also has a summer house and a studio with a car port underneath.

Lone Oak Cottage has a 26-foot reception room, five bedrooms and an open-plan kitchen and dining room, as well as a barn with an office above it and a car port.

The cottage backs onto Five Hundred Acre Wood, which became the Hundred Acre Wood in the timeless children’s books.

Both Lone Oak Hall (pictured) and the cottage were designed by award-winning architect Michael Wilford who said it was a unique opportunity

Award-winning architect Michael Wilford, who constructed both homes, said: 'It has a wooden frame and there's wooden floors throughout. It's not your typical little thatched cottage, it's a big family home.'

We're surrounded by Winnie the Pooh landmarks. As a kid I loved the Winnie the Pooh books and our kids have grown up with them too. They've got the chance to explore the forest and it is literally an 'enchanted place'.

'We're about a quarter of a mile off the road and our nearest neighbours, and in every other direction there's nothing for miles.

'It's really secluded, although before the Pooh Corner shop in Hartfield started issuing maps of all the locations, we often got a Japanese tourist walking down the drive looking for Pooh Bridge.'

The houses have oil fired and wood burning heating and rainwater storage tanks.

Amanda Wyatt, from estate agents Savills which is selling the properties, said: 'These two stunning properties, approached by a winding road through the woods, are in a private and tranquil setting surrounded by the enchanting Ashdown Forest.

'The forest is commonly referred to as 'Pooh Country' and places in the Winnie the Pooh books such as the Hundred Acre Wood, the Enchanted Place, Poohsticks Bridge and Pooh Corner are all based on nearby locations, where Christopher Robin used to visit with his bear.

'This is a rare opportunity for a buyer to acquire either or both of these properties in what is such a fantastic and unique setting.'

AA Milne bought Cotchford Farm, which is 1.3 miles from these properties, as a country retreat for himself and his family in 1925 and they would stay there for weekends and holidays.

His son, Christopher Robin Milne, was the namesake for Pooh's companion in his books and spent his early years exploring the forest by the Lone Oak hamlet.

Christopher's experiences and discoveries provided Milne with material for his stories and most of the characters - Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Piglet, Eeyore, Kanga and Roo - were based on Christopher's stuffed toys.

The sale has come to light on Winnie the Pooh Day, which celebrates the birthday of AA Milne on January 18, 1882.

His first book, Winnie-the-Pooh, was published in 1926 with illustrations by EH Shepard, followed by House at Pooh Corner two years later.

He also wrote poems about the bear in the children's verse books When We Were Very Young (1924) and Now We Are Six (1927)

The stories have been translated into more than 50 different languages, including Latin.

Although the Poohsticks game was invented in the books, it has crossed over into the real world and a World Championship Poohsticks race takes place in Oxfordshire every year.

AA Milne famously denounced war in his pacifist essay Peace with Honour, but classified documents found in an old trunk revealed the author of Winnie the Pooh was recruited by a secret propaganda unit during the First World War.
