A homeless man described as 'looking like Jesus' has saved the life of a baby born at an Oklahoma City petrol station.

Heavily pregnant Keaton Morris was forced to deliver her little girl, Tatum, at the Choctaw Road truck stop on Thursday night after going into labour four weeks early while driving home with her fiance.

But when the infant had the umbilical cord wrapped around her neck and wasn't breathing, drifter Gary Wilson stepped in, saving the little one's life.

'He was our angel that night, that's for sure,' Ms Mason told News9.

The couple called 911 in a panic after pulling into the truck stop as Ms Mason was going into labour. But the little girl was born quickly, in the passenger seat of the pair's Honda.

'The lady was screaming 'my baby, my baby's blue... she's not breathing,'' witness Jennifer Morris told the TV station.

At that point, Mr Wilson, who had been standing nearby trying to hitch a ride east, got on the phone and calmly executed the 911 dispatcher's medical instructions.

He saved baby Tatum's life by freeing her neck, tying the umbilical cord in a knot and rubbing her back as she began to breathe on own.

'He did everything perfectly right,' paramedic Sandra Lesperance told News9.

In the emergency call, Mr Wilson can be heard speaking confidently with a clear voice.

'He kept me pretty calm actually,' Ms Mason said. 'He said ''everything's OK. She's OK, she's breathing.'''

After his good deed, truck stop employees offered Mr Wilson a hot meal and a place to sleep, which he accepted.

But the man, who had been holding a sign saying 'Memphis' when the commotion began, was gone by the next day, telling people he was making his way from Montana to Jacksonville, Fla.

Truck stop worker Waneva Morris said the family's saviour was a 'very nice gentleman' who looked more than a little like the son of god.

'I would describe him as kinda like looking like Jesus,' she said. 'He had the long hair, the long beard. Just a very nice gentleman.'

As for the newborn, Ms Mason said little Tatum was born 4 pounds, 11 ounces and is now doing well.
