The war of words between Charles Saatchi and Nigella Lawson intensified last night after he claimed the TV chef had taken part in ‘illegal acts’.

Mr Saatchi, 70, accused Nigella of potentially criminal behaviour in an apparent bid to smear her wholesome reputation.

The unsubstantiated claims – which were made to a Sunday newspaper but not published – could damage her career at a time when she is preparing to film a TV series in Los Angeles.

Charles Saatchi, 70, has accused Nigella Lawson of potentially criminal behaviour in an apparent bid to smear her wholesome reputation

The millionaire art dealer allowed his daughter Phoebe, 18, to make a statement to the newspaper about her step- mother’s alleged involvement in illegal activities.

The move will fuel claims that he is using his daughter as a tool with which to attack his estranged wife. Meanwhile, Nigella’s friends claimed yesterday that Saatchi had threatened to kill himself in an attempt to win her back.

After their decree nisi was granted on July 31, the pair had two telephone conversations, during which Saatchi apparently threatened to take his own life.

It was the first time they had spoken since he was photographed grabbing her by the throat outside a Mayfair restaurant eight weeks ago.

A source said: ‘Charles has  been texting and phoning Nigella endlessly. One minute he’s pleading, the next bullying … In the end, after the threats, Nigella called him.

‘It was a case of “please come back”. Nigella was sympathetic … and said I hope you don’t [do anything silly].’

Phoebe also reportedly contacted Nigella to say she was worried about Saatchi’s state of mind.

It comes after the teenager made an emotional statement to the Mail claiming that her step-mother had abandoned her.

Saatchi brought his daughter to the telephone on Saturday to read out a brief statement.

She said: ‘The statement is: “Nigella has not spoken to me since she left our house on that Sunday when the newspaper story appeared. She has behaved in a very cold-hearted way.

‘“She has been my mother since I was seven or eight and has just abandoned me.” That’s it.’

Nigella has been on holiday in Italy with her children Cosima, 19, and Bruno, 17, but it is thought she returned to the UK yesterday.
