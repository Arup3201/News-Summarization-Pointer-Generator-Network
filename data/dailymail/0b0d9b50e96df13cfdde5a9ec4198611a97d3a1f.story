The severe economic downturn is being blamed for the sudden closure of a 71-year-old independent school just days before the start of the new term.

Governors waited until the day after Boxing Day to tell parents of pupils at £9,000-a-year St Michael’s School in Tawstock, North Devon, through letters and emails that it would not reopen next week.

It is understood the school's 30 staff also learned of the news on Tuesday.

The gradual decline in pupils from 300 ten years ago to 170 at the start of the term combined with the unexpected withdrawal of 10 pupils before the Christmas break forced the governors' hand.

Set in 30 acres, St Michael's School (main white building) in Tawstock, Devon, looks down to the church further down the Taw Valley. The 71-year-old school stunned pupils and staff this week when it announced it had gone into administration

Some parents are believed to be attempting a rescue bid for the school

However some parents are believed to be attempting a rescue bid.

One parent, a nurse from Bideford who wished to remain anonymous, said reading the e-mail was a huge shock.

She said: 'I have three children at the school and the eldest joined two years ago.

'It was just such a great atmosphere. All the teachers knew the children’s names, it was like a big family.

'It is just devastating - friends with children at the school have already said "Oh my God, what are we going to do?"

'I don’t think the news has sunk in yet with the children.'The school was set up in 30 acres of parkland overlooking the Taw Valley during World War II for evacuated boys from Sussex. It caters for youngsters aged three months to 13 years.

Mark Parkhouse, chairman of governors, wrote: 'It is with enormous regret that the governors of St Michael’s School have had to announce that, after 71 years at Tawstock, the school will not be reopening in January and has been placed into administration with immediate effect.

'The school’s closure will be a huge blow to staff, parents and especially the children, and we cannot emphasise enough our sadness at having to take this devastating decision.

'Falling numbers, due in large measure to the severe economic downturn, have played a substantial part in the school’s decline.'

The decision to close came just a month after the school’s latest visit from the Independent School’s Inspectorate, which gave it a glowing report.

Inspectors said: 'A purposeful and enjoyable learning environment is evident throughout the school.'

A study in September revealed that nearly a third of parents who pay for private education are thinking twice about sending children to independent schools or slashing the amount of money they spend.

It emerged that up to 500,000 families would consider educating one child privately while sending other siblings to state schools.

The Schroders bank survey found that changes in the way money is spent on private education could leave a swathe of independent schools vulnerable to closure as parents search for more competitive alternatives.

On the St Michael's official Facebook page a statement said: 'The governors have made the very difficult decision today to pass the school over to receivers.'

It added 'some current parents are trying to make a final attempt to save it, if you would be interested in helping please get in touch'.

A meeting is due to take place today for parents where schools allocation for the pupils’ will be discussed.

Representatives from other private schools in North Devon and from the local education authority will attend to help with preparations.

Former headmaster Bill Pratt, who also heard the news of the closure on Tuesday, said: 'We have been waiting for it to happen.

'The rapid decline in pupils in the last couple of years has been noticeable but that doesn’t mean it is any less of a shock.

'A lot of people will be very sad, including myself.'

On the unofficial 'Friends of St Michael’s School Tawstock' Facebook page parents and former pupils expressed shock and sadness as the news emerged.

One said: 'I can’t believe it. It always seemed such a solid fixture in our lives.'

Until the 1970s the school, formerly Tawstock Court, catered for boys aged up to 13 and provided boarding. Later it opened admissions to girls.

Boarding came to an end in 2000 and it was after this the nursery was set up which cared for children as young as three months.
