An Idaho State University assistant professor accidentally shot himself in the foot during class with a semiautomatic handgun he was carrying inside his pocket, police said on Wednesday.

Shot: Byron Bennett shot himself in the foot during class

Byron Bennett was giving a lecture to 20 students when his small caliber pistol discharged in the Physical Science Complex just before 4pm, according to Pocatello Police Lieutenant Paul Manning.

The injured teacher was was treated and released from a local hospital, and possessed a so-called enhanced concealed-carry permit that allowed him to carry a hidden gun on campus under a state law that went into effect on July 1.

Bennett has taught at the school since 2007 and earned his doctorate in organometallic chemistry at the University of Wyoming in 1997. 

The highly qualified chemist has 24 publications to his credit and has collaborated with 37 co-authors between 1995 and 2010.

Bennett has also been cited by 159 authors, according to Academic Search writes the Idaho State Journal.

He has declined to comment about the accident.

An investigation is underway to determine if he will be charged with a misdemeanor for discharging a firearm within city limits, the Idaho State Journal reports. 

Idaho’s Republican-led legislature passed the law allowing guns on university grounds earlier this year over the objection of the presidents of the state’s leading universities, including Idaho State, which was routinely ranked as one of the safest campuses in the United States.

In response to the new law, the university for the first time dispatched public safety officers armed with semiautomatic pistols to patrol the university’s southeastern Idaho campus this summer to safeguard students and staff.

Those officers and Pocatello police responded to Tuesday's shooting, which college spokeswoman Adrienne King said did not pose an imminent threat to the school of 14,000 students nor require a lockdown or evacuations.

An examination of records dating to 1997 showed no other reports of an accidental shooting on campus, she said.

Manning said authorities are investigating why the small-caliber weapon discharged, whether it was fitted with a safety device and if the device was engaged at the time of the incident.

Guns are banned in areas of the physical science complex where there is nuclear research but are allowed under the new law in the chemistry lab where the firearm went off, King said.

Twenty students are enrolled in the chemistry course but it was unclear how many were on hand when the incident took place, King said.

'Idaho State University is in compliance with the Idaho gun law. Yesterday’s incident was an unfortunate accident,' university President Arthur Vailas said in a statement.

The university is likely to conduct an administrative review of the incident after a probe by Pocatello police, officials said.
