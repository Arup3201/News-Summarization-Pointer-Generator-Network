For many of us getting to a standing position on a surfboard is a big ask.

But one Canadian singer took the sport to a whole new level and balanced on his board while playing a guitar and singing.

The three-minute clip posted on YouTube shows Chris Hau, 22, playing Otis Redding’s Sittin’ On The Dock Of The Bay, while he’s pulled on his board behind a boat in Barrie, Ontario.

Surfing the sea: For many of us getting to a standing position on a surfboard is a big ask. But one Canadian singer took the sport to a whole new level and balanced on his board while playing a guitar and singing

Making a splash: The three-minute clip posted on YouTube shows Chris Hau, 22, playing Otis Redding's Sittin' On The Dock of the Bay, while he's pulled on his board behind a boat in Barrie, Ontario

'I genuinely surf . . . I play guitar,' said Mr Hau, a recent Ryerson University radio and television grad from Aurora, who filmed the video in July.

'This whole video is completely genuine. So I’m hoping because of that, that will resonate with people and hopefully they’ll share it and like it,' he told The Star.

Mr Hau said that to get ready for the shot he spent he taught himself how to sing when he couldn't hear himself by turning on the lawn mower in his garage.

Two loves: 'I genuinely surf... I play guitar,' said Mr Hau, a recent Ryerson University radio and television grad from Aurora, who filmed the video in July

Genuine: 'This whole video is completely genuine. So I'm hoping because of that, that will resonate with people and hopefully they'll share it and like it,' he said

Plans: Singing while surfing is just the start for Mr Hau - he now plans to release more videos in the next weeks, including one of him performing while parasailing

Mr Hau learnt how to sing when he 
couldn’t hear himself, in preparation for a loud boat pulling him during
 the shoot. He practised in his garage with the lawn mower on.

'I played the song over and over again and kept listening back to the audio tracks until I was singing in key,' said Mr Hau.

But singing while surfing is just the start for Mr Hau - he now plans to release more videos in 
the next weeks, including one of him performing while parasailing.
