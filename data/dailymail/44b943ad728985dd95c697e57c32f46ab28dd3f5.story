Darren Wilson is leaving the Ferguson Police Department, his attorneys confirmed just two days after it was announced the 28-year-old cop would not face trial in the shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown.

When Wilson gave his first TV interview on Tuesday, he said it was unlikely he would return to his job  but still hadn't made a final decision at the time. One day later, it seems his mind was made up.

'It's not a question of if, it's a question of when,' attorney Neil Bruntrager told CNN, saying Wilson is currently negotiating his resignation from the Missouri police department.

'Realistically, he can't go back to being a police officer. He knows that. There's no illusion about any of this. But it's the way in which he leaves ... that's important to him on different levels,' Bruntrager added.

Mr Bruntrager also revealed that Wilson found out that his home address was circulating online while he was mowing his lawn.

He said within three hours he had gathered his belongings and gone into hiding leaving his grass only 'half mowed'. 

Wilson's legal team also spoke about the tough decision for him to go into hiding and contemplate quitting the police force in an interview with the Washington Post.

In the interview, the four-person legal team who specialize in representing law enforcement officers, say it took Wilson a long time to realize it would be too dangerous to return to his job, either in Ferguson or anywhere else. He has been on paid administrative leave ever since the incident, continuing to receive his $45,300 salary.

'I think I expressed to him, "Do you realize your first call [back on the job] will be to a blind alley where you’re executed?"' attorney James Towey recalls. 'He took a pause for a minute, thought about it and said, "Oh." That is the reality.'

Wilson talked about some of the dangers he would face and bring to his co-workers if he returned, in his first and only TV interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos.

'Do you really think it's possible?' Wilson asked. 'Do you think they would accept me? Do you think it would be safe for me? Those are all questions, not only for me but other officers. Is attention brought to me going to hurt one of them? Can I put them in that situation?' 

The shooter: Darren Wilson's attorneys also spoke out about what it was like to represent the cop the last three and a half while he was under investigation in the shooting death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Tragic: The 28-year-old cop shot dead Brown at the end of a 90-second encounter with the teen last August 9. His attorneys say witness accounts of the event were 'total bull'. The crime scene pictured above

In the Washington Post article, Wilson's legal team went on to call witness accounts of the shooting 'total bull' while describing how they've shielded their client during the more than three-month grand jury investigation.

They said that Wilson was forced to keep a low profile and would spend time in dark theaters watching movies to avoid detection.  

While they said Wilson had become the 'poster child for bad race relations' his lawyers were confident that they had the upper hand throughout the grand jury process, thanks to conflicting witness reports. 

But it was also those first accounts of the shooting that  painted their client in the most negative light, and what turned the incident in the predominantly-black community of Ferguson, Missouri into a national issue.

Right after Brown was shot on August 9, the friend who was with the teenager at the time told reporters about how they were minding their own business when Wilson drove up and started harassing them, even pulling Brown by the collar.

Friend Dorian Johnson said his friend tried running away, and was turning around with his hands raised in surrender when Wilson fired the fatal shots. 

Towey calls this account 'total bull' and that Brown's blood trail actually showed he may have been charging towards Wilson right before he was killed.

Meanwhile, they say their legal defense was beefed up by Wilson's consistent account of the events, which they claim have not changed since right after the shooting to his first and only TV interview on ABC two days ago.

One side of the story: Wilson's attorneys were especially unconvinced by Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, who has always said that the teen was raising his hands in surrender when Wilson fired the fatal shots. Johnson pictured on the right with his own attorney 

Surrender: Johnson's account has turned into somewhat of a rally call for those outraged by Brown's death. At protests after the grand jury decision was announced Monday night, demonstrators marched with their hands up, chanting 'Hands up, don't shoot' and 'No justice, no peace' 

'Everybody says that [his story] was so rehearsed and he was so prepped,' attorney Danielle Thompson said of the ABC interview. 'But the way Darren tells the story has not changed from the minute the shooting occurred. He could probably tell it in his sleep if he had to.'

Just married: Wilson's lawyers also explained how they shielded him from the public during the grand jury process. They say he rarely went out and when he did he would wear 'disguises'. One rare occasion he left the house was in October, to get a marriage license (pictured above)

Wilson's lawyers also went on to describe how they have protected his privacy during the grand jury process, especially after his home address was published in news reports just 10 days after the shooting. 

From there, Wilson spent a week living with one of his attorneys, Greg Kloeppel, before his legal team found him a 'quote-unquote permanent' residence.  

They say he hasn't been back to his house since. 

Wilson's lawyers say they made the decision early on to keep their client out of the public eye -  quite a difference from George Zimmerman, the Florida man who was acquitted on charges of shooting dead 17-year-old Trayvon Martin two years ago, sparking similar outrage on race relations.

'[Zimmerman] is an idiot, Darren was not,' Towey said. 'Any criminal defense lawyer that has half a brain says, "Shut up, don’t say a word."'

Only a few pictures emerged of Wilson during the three and a half months he was under investigation, but he still took great care not to be recognized on the rare occasions he would go out in public - like when he recently obtained a marriage license in Clayton, Missouri for his wedding last month to fellow police officer Barbara Spradling, 37.

Attorney Neil Bruntrager says Wilson used 'certain [disguise] tricks' picked up in police training to avoid attention. 

'He cross-dressed a lot,' Brutrager joked. They also say he went to the movies a lot, since the darkness provided privacy.

'You have to take precautions, where you sit in a restaurant and where you drive,' Wilson elaborated to ABC. 'You have to make sure no one is following you.' 

Outrage: The grand jury's decision not to indict Wilson on any charges in Brown's death led to violent riots in Ferguson, Missouri Monday night. The massive demonstration means Wilson will likely have to continue living a very private life 

What next? It's still unclear what Wilson and his wife will do once he leaves the Ferguson police department. Above, protesters ransack a police cruiser Monday night

The continued violence in Ferguson, the fact that his face has been broadcast on all major networks for the past four months, and an ongoing federal investigation mean Wilson will likely have to continue living like a recluse. 

It's also uncertain what will happen to his wife, who is also a police officer in Ferguson, since her picture and name have been reported. That question will likely be answered later, as it was revealed Wednesday that she is pregnant, and may already, or soon will be, on maternity leave.

One option that has been discussed  is Wilson being put in witness protection, but the cop wouldn't qualify for the program unless he was indicted on federal charges and made to testify in court.

Money is also a concern, once he is released from the Ferguson Police Department.  Supporters raised some $500,000 to help him pay his legal bills and other costs on two GoFundMe pages before the accounts were shut down. It's unclear though whether Wilson would be able to spend the money or need to put it towards defending himself in a possible civil suit from Brown's family.

In their Washington Post interview, Wilson's lawyers explained why the police officer has not made a  public apology to the Brown family.

'Even if he gave the most heartfelt apology, they’d still not like it,' Towey said.

'Taking a life is a horrible thing to have to do,' Bruntrager said. 'And yet, the key phrase is, "to have to do." Because that is what he thinks. Is that going to make the Browns feel any less grief?' 

Won't say sorry: Wilson's attorneys also explained why he hasn't issued a public apology to Michael Brown's family (Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden pictured above in the white beanie and blue shirt, after hearing the grand jury decision), saying they would never accept anything he has to say
