A dramatic escalation of airport anti-terror checks on electronic gadgets was announced by ministers last night.

Tests on mobile phones, laptops and tablets that had been limited to passengers flying to the US will now be massively expanded to cover destinations around the world.

British Airways and Virgin
 Atlantic have both vowed to foot the 
bill to send on any uncharged electronic devices to passengers prevented
 from flying with them under the new rules.

A dramatic escalation of airport anti-terror checks on electronic gadgets was announced by ministers

The new restrictions are understood to affect hundreds more flights to and from the Middle 
East and volatile parts of Africa and Asia, including popular summer 
holiday destinations such as Egypt.

However, because neither airlines nor transport officials will confirm which routes are included, every single passenger must assume their gadgets will be checked, and act accordingly.

Travellers will have to prove their electronic devices – some with a notoriously short battery life – are working normally, following fears that terrorists could pack the battery compartments with explosives.

The development, which comes at the start of the summer holiday season, is based on US intelligence amid fears of an attack by Islamist extremists.

Security officials are concerned that a booby-trapped electronic device could be smuggled onto a plane and used as a bomb by Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula or the Islamist Nusra Front, Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria.

In 2009, Yemen-linked explosives expert Ibrahim al-Asiri was behind a similar plot and built an ‘underwear bomb’, used in a failed attempt to bring down a plane from Amsterdam bound for Detroit.

Passengers were first warned last week
 of extra checks on phones, and on Monday British Airways said it would 
ban travellers from boarding US-bound flights if their electronic 
devices were not charged.

It
 performed a partial U-turn yesterday, announcing that anyone whose 
devices had a flat battery could still fly – but they would have to 
leave their gadgets behind, and pay for them to be sent to their home 
address.

Official advice to 
travellers from the Department for Transport had previously been limited
 to those ‘flying to the USA’. It now affects those ‘flying to and from 
the UK’, and states: ‘Make sure your electronic devices are charged 
before you travel. If your device doesn’t switch on, you won’t be 
allowed to bring it on to the aircraft.’

Gadgets packed in checked luggage will
 continue to be scanned as normal. Passengers whose devices are deemed 
to be suspicious could be prevented from leaving them in the hold – and 
could be barred from getting on flights altogether.

Transport
 Secretary Patrick McLoughlin  said yesterday that ‘passengers may 
notice additional security measures on some routes both to and from the 
UK’.

A DfT spokesman added:
 ‘In line with the US advice, passengers on some routes into and out of 
the UK may now also be required to show that electronic devices in their
 hand luggage are powered up or face not being allowed to bring the 
device onto the aircraft.’

Mr
 McLoughlin told the House of Commons that the new advice ‘is in line 
with that issued by the US, and we have updated our official advice to 
passengers accordingly’.

His
 written statement continued: ‘For obvious reasons we will not be 
commenting in detail on the measures or the routes affected.

'We will 
work with the aviation industry to minimise disruption as far as 
possible.’

Mr McLoughlin stressed there was no change to the terror 
threat level, which remains at ‘substantial’, but warned: ‘We face a 
constantly evolving threat from terrorism and must respond accordingly.’

The escalation in security
 checks came hours after British Airways ditched its own ‘no charge, no 
fly’ rule, announcing that passengers whose devices had a flat battery 
could still board planes – but without their gadgets.

The airline will 
now see checks extended far beyond the 35 daily flights from the UK to 
the US which were first affected.

A
 BA spokesman said: ‘We would advise that all customers flying on routes
 into and out of the UK, as well on flights from the UK to US cities, 
ensure that their electronic devices are powered up, as there may be 
extra searches and checks before boarding.

'Our flights continue to 
operate as normal.’

They 
added: ‘Safety and security is our top priority at all times and we 
continue to work closely with airports and governments around the 
world.’

British Airways, Virgin, and other UK airlines, are advising passengers to arrive 
at airports with devices fully charged as laid down by the new rules.

BA said that passengers should arrive in good time at check in and also at the boarding gate, as there could be extra checks.

BA said: 'We have in place a range of options if customers are not able to comply, when requested, with the new regulations.

'Customers
 can ask to be rebooked on to a later service. If you wish to carry on 
the item as part of your hand luggage, you will need to ensure that the 
device can be charged ahead of your rebooked flight.

'Alternatively, 
customers can leave the device behind and hand it to a member of our 
customer service team. You will be asked to complete a form and the item
 can be collected on your return to Heathrow or forwarded to an address 
of your choice.'

Virgin Atlantic said it was texting all passengers 
to advise them of the new arrangements and that it had charger 
facilities available at airports for all the most popular devices.

The airline announced today that it is now scrapping the charge it had earlier planned to make to customers for returning their uncharged phones – putting it in line with rivals British Airways who are also returning phones for free.

In updated advice to passengers Virgin Atlantic said: ‘Customers can leave their uncharged device behind and Virgin Atlantic will return it to the customer without a charge.’
