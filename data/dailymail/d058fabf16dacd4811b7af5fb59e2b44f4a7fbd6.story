Republic of Ireland winger James McClean has played down fears that he could miss Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Poland through injury.

McClean was sent for a scan on Tuesday after limping out of training at Gannon Park in Malahide, leaving manager Martin O'Neill with his fingers crossed.

However, the Wigan midfielder has insisted he will be ready for the Group D clash even if he may not train again until later in the week.

McClean told the Irish Independent: 'The ankle should be fine. I said I'd give it a go in training, but unfortunately it was just too sore to carry out the session.

'I went and had a scan and thankfully it's just some bone bruising. It should be cleared up in time for the weekend's game, which is obviously positive news.

'I will just need to rest it now with plenty of ice and re-evaluate it in the morning to see if I can train. If not, then hopefully I'll be able to get a training session or two in before the game.'

However, O'Neill still has concerns over full-back Stephen Ward and midfielder Darron Gibson, who are struggling with ankle and groin problems respectively.

McClean has made 30 league appearances for Wigan this season and has notched six goals along the way
