Mario Balotelli's former club AC Milan have paid tribute to their departed striker, and thanked him for his efforts during his year-and-a-half stay at the club.

The Italian forward left Milan to join Liverpool for £16million on Monday after a largely successful spell with the Rossoneri that saw Balotelli score 28 goals in 51 appearances. 

And the Milan club have released an official statement thanking the striker and celebrating his 'memorable moments'.

'Thank you for everything and for what you have done at the club. We wish you the very best of luck for your next sporting and professional adventure.'
