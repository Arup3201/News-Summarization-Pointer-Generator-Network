A Home Guard inspired Dad's Army of computer security experts will be set up to protect Britain's businesses and help the armed forces at times of national emergency, it has emerged today.

These 'reservists' will work alongside a new team of internet boffins who had helped the Government protect the UK from cyber attack during last summer's Olympics.

Official figures show that 90 per cent of all big business in Britain was attacked online in 2011 - costing them at least £250,000 each.

Security: Inspired by the Home Guard portrayed in Dad's Army - the Government is forming a team of reservists to protect Britain's businesses and armed forces from cyber attack

Online industries are worth £82billion a year to Britain, so Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude has announced the measures to protect those that 'suffer at the hands of such threats'.

As part of the plan the Ministry of Defence will set up a 'cyber reserve' it could bring in when it needed help.

While three universities: De Montfort University, the University of Worcester and Queens University Belfast, will be used to train their students in computer security to form the next generation of British cyber guardians.

'We are constantly examining new ways to harness and attract the talents of the cyber security specialists that are needed for critical areas of work,' Mr Maude said in a written answer to Parliament.

Home Secretary Theresa May wants security services to be able to snoop on email and internet records, but Nick Clegg is seeking to delay the Communications Data Bill

'To this end, the MoD is taking forward the development of a ‘cyber reserve’, allowing the services to draw on the wider talent and skills of the nation in the cyber field.'

The Dad'd Army idea is 'currently in development', he said, adding: 'Working with the private sector to improve awareness of the need for better cyber security continues to be a priority'.

Water and power firms in particular are being targeted by foreign countries launching cyber attacks against Britain.

The services ‘upon which daily life depends’ risk being disrupted by hackers working for the UK's enemies, officials claimed.

Internet terrorism from ‘hostile foreign states’ is now one of the top four threats Britain faces.

The scale of the problem comes as Home Secretary Theresa May stepped up her call for more powers to track email and internet use.

She claimed people will ‘die’ without more powers to track terrorists, paedophiles and criminals online.

A major Coalition split was laid bare as Mrs May took a swipe at Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg for blocking new internet powers to break up criminal plots on sites like Facebook and Skype.

The £2billion law – dubbed a snoopers charter - would store billions of pieces of private information from emails, Facebook, texts and internet use.

In a thinly-veiled swipe at her Cabinet colleague, Mrs May said opponents of her legislation are 'putting politics before people’s lives’.

Mrs May said opponents of her Communications Data Bill had to 'look victims of terrorism in the eye', like those caught up in the 7/7 London bombings

Mr Clegg wants to delay the Communications Data Bill until 2014 to strike a balance between security and liberty’.

But Mrs May said: ‘The people who say they’re against this bill need to look victims of serious crime, terrorism and child sex offences in the eye and tell them why they’re not prepared to give the police the powers they need to protect the public.

‘We would certainly see criminals going free as a result of this. There will be paedophiles who will not be identified and it will reduce our ability to deal with this serious organised crime,’ she told The Sun.

Mrs May suggested 
the new laws were needed to prevent a repeat of the 7/7 London bombings 
or the shootings of two female police officers in Manchester in 
September.

‘The
 shootings of Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone brought everybody up sharp to
 show the extent of the problem that can be caused by criminals.

‘It
 would be harder for us to crack into organised crime gangs, and yes we 
could see people dying as a result of not being able to have access to 
this information.’

She went on: 'Criminals, terrorists and paedophiles will want MPs to vote against this bill.

'Victims of crime, police and the public will want them to vote for it. It's a question of whose side you're on.'

However, a committee of MPs and peers is
 expected to issue damning criticism of the measures this week, arguing 
ministers have not made the case that is really needed.

The Home Office insists the proposed storage of website visits for 12 months, along with use of Skype and even online games consoles, will protect national security.

Without it, police and the security services will lose their ability to track the activities of crime gangs and paedophiles over time, they argue.

Cyber attacks have been launched against the supplies 'upon which daily life depends,' including power firms

Officials warn that new technology will allow terrorists to hatch plots or swap sickening images. Gaps in coverage already mean the authorities have no access to a quarter of all communications data.

The plans would cover when and to whom a phone call was made, not what was said. The content of emails would also not be stored, just details of who sent and received them.
