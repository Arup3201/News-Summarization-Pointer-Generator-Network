An 18-year-old Arizona man accused of being a serial sex predator who allegedly targeted fellow high school students has been re-arrested.

Officials say Pinal County sheriff's detectives arrested Tyler Kost on Thursday on new allegations that include additional cases reported after his initial arrest.

'This is a serious and serial sex offender and rapist,' Sheriff Paul Babeu said during a news conference. 'We're approaching 20 victims. There likely will be others that come forward.'

Nearly all of the potential victims are high school students.

Multiple charges: Tyler Kost, 18, from Arizona is accused of multiple sex crimes against an underaged girls in the state. He has now been re-arrested as the number of potential victims climbs to 18

Lured teenage girls: Detectives said because he looked young and innocent, many people didn't perceive him as a threat

Investigators said they discovered one girl is 13 years old. The oldest girl is 17.

'Once we started looking at it, it immediately started to mushroom,' said Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu. 'We absolutely believe there will be far more victims that are out there.'

Babeu also said Kost threatened and harassed victims that escalated so much that two fled the state and one attempted suicide.

Kost is a student at Poston Butte High School. He wasÂ  booked into the Pinal County Jail on two counts of sexual assault and two counts of sexual misconduct with a minor related to one of the cases.

In one case, Kost threatened, harassed
 and told one of the victims to kill herself, deputies said. The girl 
followed through and attempted suicide and was hospitalized.

While
 in the hospital, she allegedly got a message from Kost, threatening 
that if she returned to school he would 'make her life a living hell.'

The arrest came after someone tipped off a Pinal County sheriff's detective assigned to the Persons Crimes Bureau.

Around the same time, officials with the Florence Unified School District say Kost came into the office to report being bullied.

He
 was not aware there was a simultaneous investigation of the sex 
assaults with Kost as a suspect, as well as the bully allegations.

School
 officials said the thinking was that Kost was being bullied in relation
 to rumors among students that he was involved in the alleged assaults.

Detectives opened an investigation and identified eight other girls who claimed they had been sexually assaulted, sexually abused and molested by Kost.

The alleged attacks happened at several places.

'He would assault these young female victims in their own bedrooms, in his bedroom, in the desert, at a community pool, at community parks,' Babeu said.

Detectives said because he looked young and innocent, many people didn't perceive him as a threat.

A County Attorney's Office spokesman was not able to immediately identify Kost's lawyer.

'There was a clear breach of trust,' Babeu said of Kost. 'From all of the accounts of the victims, (Kost) is someone who is highly manipulative, very charismatic and charming in how he presented himself. And then things obviously turned.'

The sheriff was also critical of the judge who released Kost on bond after the initial charges were filed.

Nasty man: In one case, Kost threatened, harassed and told one of the victims to kill herself, deputies said. The girl followed through and attempted suicide and was hospitalized

Kost, who lives in the San Tan Valley on the southeast fringe of the Phoenix metropolitan area, was released on $10,000 bond after being arrested Monday on suspicion of two counts each of sexual assault and sexual misconduct with a minor.

The County Attorney's Office said it had requested a $100,000 bond for Kost but is now asking that he be held without bond. The office says Kost allegedly threatened to kill victims and witnesses.

Kost was scheduled to make an initial appearance in court Friday on the new allegations.
