In the commons, he is flanked by the likes of Theresa May and Philip Hammond.

So when William Hague walked into a summit between Hollywood's most famous couple, it was likely he was going to be a little starstruck.

The Foreign Secretary arrived alongside Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie for the third day of the global summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict at London's ExCel.

As they 
entered the exhibition centre in London's Docklands, the 
Conservative politician stood in the middle of the Hollywood couple to 
pose for photographs.

The
 coming together of an 'unlikely double act' - Jolie and Mr Hague - is 
an example of how foreign policy should be conducted in future, the 
Conservative politician said last night.

The Tomb Raider actress, who is special 
envoy for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, is dressed in an 
entirely black outfit, having been in white for the first two days of 
the summit.

Her partner wore a black suit with an open white shirt and sunglasses, while Mr Hague donned a pink tie.

The pair admitted in a later TV interview that they had no problem being dubbed the 'odd couple' of international relations. Ms Jolie said she was fine with 'whatever works' claiming that she regularly raised human rights issues at home with her children, who have been adopted from several different countries.

Ms Jolie said she was happy with 'whatever works'.

George Clooney's barrister fiancée Amal Alamuddin was also at the summit along with other members of the legal profession.

Both Mr Hague and Ms Jolie took a brief break from the conference to visit Clarence House where they had a private audience with the Duchess of Cornwall.

Ms Alamuddin listened to the speeches from the audience on the opposite side of the auditorium to where Jolie and Pitt were sitting.

The Oxford-educated barrister, who has represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, has been described as a 'passionate defender of human rights'.

The combination of Jolie's star power along with government can be 'formidable', Mr Hague said last night. He also said the film star is 'a pleasure to work with'.

He said: 'My admiration for her work has grown even greater over the last two years.

'She has the power to speak to the whole world, to raise awareness, change attitudes.

'Governments
 like the one I am a member of hold in their hands levers of decision 
making and action. And this combination can be formidable.

'And is in many respects a strong example of the future of foreign policy and how it should be conducted.

'It's no longer the sole preserve of governments.'

He said Jolie brings 'vast expertise', adding: 'She is an inspiration.'

Jolie and Mr Hague are co-chairing the four-day global summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict (ESVC) - now in its third day - and have launched an international protocol which they hope will 'really, truly end impunity'.

At an event this morning where the Hollywood star and Conservative politician both spoke, Pitt looked on from the front row.

Ms Jolie and Mr Hague were later interviewed by CNN's Christiane Amanpour who asked them whether they were concerned about the 'odd couple' of international relations label.

Ms Jolie insisted she was wine with 'whatever works' as it was important to keep raising the issue of sexual violence against women.

She said: 'You are moved by the people you meet.'

She added that she felt it was important to discuss this issue at home with her children: 'I'm very, very open with my children. Some of my children have come from countries that were in conflict with each other; my son who's Cambodian, my son who's Vietnamese. So we have lots of discussions in the house. My daughter is African and we talk about civil rights, and they look at their sister and think how many years ago how different their relationship to their sister would be.'

In need of assistance: As they walked around the conference centre, Jolie bent down to help two women who had fallen over

Extra help: Pitt also offered his support as security surrounded the women who had tripped

Baroness 
Warsi, who was sitting in the row behind the Hollywood heartthrob, was 
heard joking with one woman before Pitt took his seat: 'This is Team 
Hague.'

In
 her speech, addressing delegates and officials from all over the world,
 Jolie said: 'We are here for the nine-year-old girl in Uganda, 
kidnapped and forced into sexual slavery.

'We
 are here for the man in Bosnia, years after rape, still stigmatised, 
unable to earn enough money to buy bread for his family.

'We are here for all the forgotten, hidden survivors who have been made to feel ashamed or been abandoned.

'And for the children of rape - we want the whole world to hear their stories and understand that this injustice cannot be tolerated, and that sorrow and compassion are not enough.'

The audience was shown short film clips featuring the hashtag £TimeToAct, which is now trending on Twitter.
