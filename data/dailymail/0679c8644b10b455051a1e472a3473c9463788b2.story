They had gathered together to attend the funeral of mutual friend Paul Ramsay.

But Erica Packer and radio shock jock Alan Jones appeared to be intent on sharing a joke with each other as they stood outside the church.

At one point Jones, a controversial personality, put his fist to her face in what may have been a reference to her ex-husband James's fight with David Gyngell earlier in the week.

Radio shock jock Alan Jones appeared to jokingly punch Erica Packer in the face, a possible reference to her ex husband James Packer's fight with David Gyngell

Erica looked to be laughing as Jones extended his arm towards her.

The very public fight between billionaire James Packer and David Gyngell took place outside Packer's Bondi home last Sunday afternoon.

On Friday, the pair were given criminal infringement notices for offensive behaviour, a penalty which carries a fine of $500 if it goes uncontested by the recipient.

The case stalled earlier in the week due to the fact neither Packer nor Gyngell lodged an official complaint over the incident.

The fight followed a heated text message exchange because Packer believed a camera crew from the network run by Gyngell was trying to catch him with rumoured lover, model Miranda Kerr.

Gyngell had gone to the $20million property in Sydney's Bondi Beach to reassure casino owner he was not under surveillance by Nine Network television cameras.

Controversial figure Alan Jones hosts a conservative radio program on Sydney's 2GB, and is certainly no stranger to the spotlight.

In September 2012, the shock jock, who is in his 70s, made headlines when at a Sydney University Liberal Club dinner he said that former Prime Minister Julia Gillard's recently deceased father 'died of shame.'

'The old man recently died a few weeks ago of shame. To think that he had a daughter who told lies every time she stood for parliament.'

A jacket made of chaff bags and signed by Jones was also auctioned on the night, because Jones had previously said Ms Gillard should be put in a chaff bag and thrown out to sea.

Jones is known for his controversial and staunchly conservative views, and all adverstising was suspended on his radio show after the supposedly private speech sparked vicious backlash from the public.

Erica Packer and ex-husband James both attended the funeral of Paul Ramsay

Erica was pictured with her beleaguered ex-husband today for the first time since the couple announced their shock separation last year.

The 36-year-old former model and her ex-husband were seen boarding a private helicopter to fly down to Bowral to attend the funeral of billionaire Paul Ramsay.

They were accompanied on the 40-minute flight by Seven Network chairman Kerry Stokes, who owns the helicopter, his wife Christine Simpson Stokes, and his son Ryan Stokes.

The philanthropist died last week at the age of 78 after it is believed he suffered a heart attack in Spain in April.

The Packers walked solemnly side by side into the church together, occasionally smiling and touching each other's arms.

Also in attendance at St Thomas Aquinas church were Prime Minister Tony Abbott, former rugby player Phil Kearns, federal minister Barnaby Joyce and radio veteran Alan Jones who arrived with former Australian cricketing great Brett Lee and his wife Lana Anderson.

Shortly after the Packers took seats in the pews, former prime minister John Howard and wife Jeannette arrived and signed the register.

Governor-General Peter Cosgrove and his wife Lady Lynne arrived at the chapel just before 11 o'clock and gave a polite smile to the crowd gathered outside.

A number of members of the public have turned up to catch a glimpse of the star-studded funeral.

'I hope I get a seat, there's a lot of celebrities in today,' said local Innika.

Nightclub baron Justin Hemmes was also spotted outside the church with his German Shepherd.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott also attended the funeral at the Bowral church. Mr Ramsay was the most generous supporter of the Liberal Party in 2011-2012, giving more than $600,000

Paul Ramsay, 78, was the founder and chairman of Ramsay Health Care, a private hospital operator.

Ramsay Healthcare, which Mr Ramsay founded in 1964, now has more than 150 hospitals in Australia, the UK, Indonesia, Malaysia and France.

Hey was valued at $3.7 billion by Forbes in March.

In 1983, Mr Ramsay bought a stake in Prime Media, the rural arm of Channel Seven.

He was an ardent support of the Liberal Party and of former prime minster John Howard. Mr Ramsay was the party's most significant donor in 2011-2012, giving $605,000 one year.

It was announced on April 24 that he was admitted to hospital in a serious condition, it was believed that he suffered a heart attack in Spain while sailing.

Mr Ramsay was flown back to Australia and died in Bowral on the evening of May 1.

He was single and had no children, and is survived by his brother Peter Oscar, twin sister Anne and brother-in-law Brian, as well as nieces and nephews.

The company announced Mr Ramsay's stake in Ramsay health, worth $3.3 billion, will be left to his charitable foundation.

Erica flew home from LA to Sydney on Thursday morning so she could attend the funeral of the billionaire with her youngest child Emmanuelle, 20 months.

According to The Daily Telegraph, Mr Ramsay remained a firm supporter of Erica - who is also known by her maiden name Baxter - following her split from Packer in September.

Ahead of the funeral, the former Mrs Packer decided to take the opportunity to visit some friends yesterday - most notably the wife of David Gyngell, Leila McKinnon.

The pair met on Thursday afternoon, just days after the brawl between Mr Packer, 46, and Mr Gyngell, 47, which occurred outside Mr Packer's Bondi mansion.

At the funeral, Mr Packer's left eye was still visibly puffy and bruised from the fight.

Police have announced that they will be unlikely to investigate the incident any further.

Neither Mr Packer nor Mr Gyngell have lodged an official complaint over the incident, yet Mr Gyngell took responsibility for the fight in a statement.

'[Mr Gyngell] fully accepts that he was the instigator of the incident. He respects the job police do and will co-operate fully with their investigation,' it said.

The incident stemmed from an angry text message exchange between the two men, after Mr Packer thought a camera crew from the network was trying to film him with rumoured flame Miranda Kerr.

Ms Kerr was at Sydney airport this morning at the same time as Ms Packer - while the casino boss's ex arrived, his speculated new love interest was said to be flying to Shanghai.

The scuffle does not seem to have affected the relationship between Erica and Mr Gyngell's wife, Leila Mckinnon, whom the model visited on Thursday afternoon.

The TV reporter and Ms Packer are close family friends. Mr Gyngell was best man at the Packers' wedding in 2007, and Mr Packer was best man at Mr Gyngell's wedding to Ms McKinnon in 2004.

Ms McKinnon's eighteen-month-old son Ted was born just one month after Ms Packer's youngest daughter Emmanuelle.

Ms Packer, who has three children with the billionaire casino mogul, looked calm and collected on Thursday when she was spotted meeting up with friends in Sydney.

The 36-year-old jetted in from Los Angeles where she is now based, on Thursday morning carrying Emmanuelle as they made their way through the terminal.
