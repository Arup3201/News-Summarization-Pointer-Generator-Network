Lynda Spence, who disappeared two years ago, was abducted, tortured and murdered by Colin Coats and Philip Wade, a jury decided

Two men have been jailed for life for abducting, torturing and murdering businesswoman Lynda Spence, who disappeared two years ago.

Colin Coats and Philip Wade taped the financial adviser to a chair in a flat in Ayrshire, in Scotland, in April 2011 and assaulted her every day for more than a fortnight, then killed her.

Her body has never been found.

Trial judge Lord Pentland said Coats was the 'prime mover' behind the 27-year-old’s kidnapping and that he is convinced of his 'devious and cruel personality'.

Coats and Wade, both 42, forced Ms Spence into a car in Glasgow, on April 14 2011 and drove her to West Kilbride, Ayrshire, where friends David Parker and Paul Smith let them in to Parker’s flat in Meadowfoot Road.

When she arrived, Ms Spence was wearing sunglasses which were taped on the inside, and Coats gripped on to her waist.

Wade carried in a tool bag which was referred to during the trial as 'the torture kit', containing garden loppers, surgical tape and vinyl gloves.

They immediately whisked the woman upstairs to the attic area and taped her to a leather chair by the arms and waist.

In the days that followed, the two men would arrive every day to hurt her, as a way of trying to extract financial information.

She was burned with an iron, hit with a golf club and they crushed her toes, cut off her thumb and severed her pinkie finger.

Ms Spence was not allowed to move from the chair for the 13 days she was there, and had to urinate and defecate where she sat.

During the trial the court heard how Ms 
Spence and Coats were involved in a land deal at Stansted Airport, 
organised by Ms Spence, in which Coats claimed to have invested all of 
his money.

She was portrayed in court as a con artist who spent other people's money like it was her own.

Parker told how he originally believed
the arrangement was to help somebody that needed to get out of Glasgow,
but as the situation 'snowballed' he could see no way out of it.

He
and Smith were also charged with Ms Spence’s murder but were cleared 
after pleading guilty to a reduced charge of holding her against her 
will and assaulting her.

Coats, 42, was jailed for a minimum of 33
years at the High Court in Glasgow, while his co-accused, Philip Wade, 
also 42, was ordered to spend at least 30 years behind bars.

It became clear during the trial that Ms Spence dreamed up fictitious characters who were supposedly in charge of a large-scale land deal at Stansted Airport, said to be 'worth millions'.

She made up email accounts for someone called 'Uncle Ben', allegedly the main investor, using the internet connection serving Rio Cafe in Glasgow which was known to her friends as 'Lynda's Partick office'.

'Uncle Ben' replied to emails from Colin Coats who invested £85,000 - all of his money - in the fake Stansted deal.

Ms Spence strung Coats along for the best part of a year, promising him a return of more than £3million when the deal went through. He asked for it in overseas bearer bonds as a way of evading UK tax.

She came up with the bonds but they were worthless, nothing more than a novelty forged on fake Danish government-headed paper.

It was Ms Spence's financial dealings with Coats that eventually led to her brutal and untimely death. 

At the time of her disappearance in 
April 2011, she was being investigated by Strathclyde Police over claims
that she defrauded about 30 people in Glasgow.

She
was in the process of becoming a police informer for the Scottish Crime
and Drug Enforcement Agency which authorised her to report back about 
the apparent criminal conduct of former partner Sokal Zefaj and three 
others.

Ms Spence got the seal of approval from the agency on April 14: the day she was abducted.

Thirteen days later, Parker and Smith were dismissed by Coats and Wade, who told them: 'Yous (sic) can go.'

Wade was described as his 'right-hand 
man' in the killing and later told a friend, Pamela Pearson, that he 
helped dispose of a woman’s body.

In a bid to cover up the killing, Coats and Wade ordered a mass clean-up of Parker’s flat.

It
was scrubbed with bleach, while furniture, crockery and bedding was 
removed and floorboards and carpets ripped up and replaced.

The
court heard evidence that the two men drove to Wade’s friend’s caravan 
in Tighnabruaich, Argyll, where they expressed a desire to 'get rid of 
something'.

Crown witness 
Lee Winyard said he believed the car they arrived in was the same as the
one that featured in a missing person poster relating to Ms Spence’s 
disappearance.

The silver Vauxhall Astra, which had a broken wing mirror, was hired for Ms Spence about two weeks before she vanished.

A phone used by Ms Spence was discovered in a bin outside a mile away from where Wade lived in Glengarnock.

The jury found Coats unanimously guilty of murdering Ms Spence, as well as disposing of her body.

Wade was also convicted of both charges, but he was cleared of cutting off the missing woman’s head.

Coats,
from Glasgow, was further found guilty of three other charges relating 
to his threatening behaviour towards two other men to extort thousands 
of pounds from them, as well as stealing a car from Burns on May 18 2011 
after Coats said he would stab him with a pen.

As the jury’s verdicts were read out, Coats and Wade sat in the dock and made no sound. They were led back down to the cells with their heads bowed.

The packed public gallery, where some of the men’s family members sat, was also silent.

In a statement after the verdict, Ms Spence’s parents, James and Patricia, thanked police and the prosecution.

They said: 'There is no verdict that will bring our daughter Lynda back or spare her the terrible ordeal that took her life.

'We will never begin to imagine her suffering or comprehend the cruelty of any person who would do that to another human being.

'We cannot begin to understand or forgive what they did to our daughter, Lynda. No words can begin to describe the heartache and pain we are suffering.

Ms Spence was held for two weeks at this flat in Ayrshire, which belonged to a friend of Coats and Wade

'Lynda was a warm, kind and thoughtful daughter and was someone who always had time for others.

'We miss her so much.'

Following the verdict, the officer in 
charge of the murder investigation, Detective Superintendent Alan 
Buchanan, said: 'I hope in some small way this will 
bring some satisfaction to Lynda’s parents who have had to endure the 
pain of hearing the graphic details of the horrific torture and terror 
inflicted on Lynda in her final days.

'Although satisfied with the verdict, 
the pain for the Spence family continues as due to the actions of the 
accused, Mr and Mrs Spence have been unable to lay their daughter to 
rest.

'At this time I would appeal for those
convicted to show some common decency and tell us where Lynda is in 
order that we can get her back to her parents and allow them to grieve 
properly and move some way towards rebuilding their lives.'
