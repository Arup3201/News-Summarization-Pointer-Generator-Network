Paul Scholes is used to plaudits from his peers as one of the greatest midfielders of his generation by now - but not usually at half time during a game.

World Cup winner and Bayern Munich star Bastian Schweinsteiger sought out the legendary midfielder during the break at an all-star game at the Allianz Arena with one thing on his mind: claiming Scholes' shirt.

The former England international obliged and took his fellow midfielder's shirt too as a memento from the occasion before playing the second half in a blank replica.

'I've given it to Schweinsteiger,' Scholes said when asked about the whereabouts of his numbered shirt.

'He asked me for a shirt at half time so I gave it to him. He gave me a shirt too which was nice because he's an amazing footballer, he's just won the World Cup. It was nice to speak to him.

'It's nice to swap a shirt with such a great player - a man who's won the World Cup and many trophies with Bayern Munich and been a fantastic player - to speak to him for a few minutes was nice.'

Scholes scored United's second goal in a 3-3 draw at the Allianz and spoke about the tough task of completing 90 minutes at the age of 39.

'It's very difficult when you get to 40 but it was very enjoyable - six goals, hopefully the crowd enjoyed the game.'
