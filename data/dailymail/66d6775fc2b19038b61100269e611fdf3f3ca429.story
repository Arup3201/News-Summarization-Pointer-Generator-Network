Criminals might have to think again about attempting a getaway after police revealed their newest and fastest police car - a 207mph McLaren worth £240,000.

The specially adapted two-seater supercar - which can hit 60mph in three seconds - will be unveiled at a car show in Birmingham this weekend.

Although it is not practical as an everyday patrol vehicle, officers from the Central Motorway Group in the Midlands hope it will help to break down barriers between police and motorists.

Watch out criminals: Britain's fastest police vehicle, a 200mph plus McLaren super car, is being unveiled at the Birmingham motor show this weekend

Speedy PC: Angus Nairn - star of 'Motorway Cops' - says the vehicle will teach people about the danger of excess speed

PC Angus Nairn - currently starring in the 'Motorway Cops' real-life TV shows - said: 'Everyone who see the McLaren wants to come and talk about it - it is an excellent way to get people to have a conversation with the police - and not end up with a fixed penalty ticket.

Production: 2011

Engine: McLaren M838T twin-turbo 3.8 L V8 - 616 horsepower

Transmission: 7-speed dual-clutch

Top speed: 207mph

Structure:  carbon fibre composite chassis

Max torque: 443 lb per ft of torque

Price: £240,000

'The car breaks the ice and gives us the opportunity to get across the safety message - especially about the dangers of excess speed.

'The McLaren is a very powerful car with a top speed of more than 200 miles an hour but it wouldn't be very practical as an every day police vehicle - there's not a great deal of luggage space and it has gull-wing doors that opens outwards and upwards so you have to leave plenty of space when you park.'

The police-liveried car will be at the Autosports Show at the NEC in Birmingham this weekend before it goes back in the showroom.

The car was supplied by local McLaren dealers and sales director David Tibbett said: 'We are delighted to help the police and their work.

'The police-liveried McLaren has some extras on and would cost around £240,000.

'We have sold more than 100 Mclaren cars since 2011 and buyers have ranged from company bosses to footballers.'

The car - a Spider 12C model - is powered by a 3.8 litre twin turbo engine which develops almost 600 bhp - six times the power of a standard Fiord Fiesta.

Luxury: The 207mph supercar is popular with celebrities, including David Beckham, and costs around £240,000

But the makers claim it still returns 25 miles to the gallon - providing it's not driven flat out at its top speed of 207mph.

England hero David Beckham has just taken delivery of a similar model to use in the USA.
