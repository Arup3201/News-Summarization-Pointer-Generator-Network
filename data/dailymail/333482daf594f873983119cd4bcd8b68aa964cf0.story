Rioters are being sentenced too harshly and should be treated like any other case in the courts, according to the head of the Crown Prosecution Service.

Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer insisted that those involved in last month's disturbances should not be regarded as a 'separate category' or dealt with differently from other criminals.

His comments come amid concern that sentences being handed down to rioters are disproportionate. Some surveys have even suggesting they are a quarter longer than normal.

Riots: The teenage looter, who cannot be identified, flees from the Poundland store in Peckham, south London

On Friday a 17-year-old girl who stole a bottle of Lucozade and some sweets from Poundland during the civil unrest was jailed for eight months.

Mr Starmer did not criticise the sentencing of rioters but stressed: 'We should not treat these cases as a separate category to be dealt with differently.

'We should treat them as we do any other case. We need to keep our feet on the ground. In other areas, such as big terrorism cases, we have resisted the temptation to call for special measures. With disorder cases, we should adopt the same approach,' he said to the Daily Telegraph.

Another example of harsh sentencing includes a Territorial Army soldier who was jailed for 13 months after she admitted stealing a television.

Lorraine McGrane, 19, who is part of the TA's bomb disposal unit, walked off with the television as looters raided an Argos store in Bermondsey, south east London.

McGrane had never been in trouble with the police before.

Aaron Mulholland, 30, joined looters as they ransacked a phone shop during the riots was jailed for 13 months.

The lifeguard drunkenly followed looters into Fone World in Camberwell Church Street, south London, after leaving a nearby pub.

Inner London Crown Court heard how he was caught by police crawling out of the store, which suffered £25,000 of losses, beneath security shutters empty-handed.

A doctor's daughter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, stole a bottle of Lucozade and helped herself to some T-shirts and a pair of sunglasses as violence broke out in Peckham.

The 17-year-old, who handed herself in to police, has been jailed for eight months and has been described as 'quiet and intelligent'.

Mr Starmer also dismissed the idea that human rights legislation was a factor in last month's outbreak of violence and looting.

Prime Minister David Cameron, by contrast, has praised the 'tough message' that the courts have been sending out in a recent interview accused the BBC of making excuses for last month's rioters.

His remarks came following a row with 
BBC presenter Evan Davis who asked Mr Cameron whether there was any 
difference between his own membership of the Bullingdon Club at Oxford 
University and the rioters.

An
 irritated Mr Cameron said everyone did stupid things when they were 
young but dismissed any comparison with the 'organised looting and 
stealing and thieving' seen across the UK last month.

Mr
 Cameron has promised to step up his crusade to mend Britain's 'broken 
society' and said a 'misinterpretation' of human rights laws had 
undermined the idea of people taking responsibility for their actions.

He also underlined the need for more discipline in schools and said there need to be tougher measures to end welfare dependency.

Awkward: Evan Davis tried to link rioting to the antics of those in the Bullingdon Club which Prime Minister David Cameron was a member of

Mr Cameron said problem youngsters needed ‘tough love’, adding: ‘You need both elements of it.

‘For some of these children there probably was a shortage of love. But you do need, when they cross the line and break the law, to be very tough.’

But the CPS chief said: 'I don't think human rights could be listed as one of the causes.

'No doubt there will be analysis of the possible causes, but to me human rights would not be among them.'
