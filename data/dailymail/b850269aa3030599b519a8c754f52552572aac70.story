The widow of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev has retained legal counsel who has an extensive client roster of suspected and convicted terrorists.

Katherine Russell added attorney Joshua Dratel to her legal team,
 her Rhode Island-based lawyer Amato DeLuca said on Wednesday.

The New York lawyer, whose office in Downtown Manhattan is just blocks away from Ground Zero, previously defended Guantanamo Bay detainees and suspects in the bombings of the U.S. embassies in East Africa.

Widow: Katherine Russell, pictured on Sunday in Rhode Island, has been interviewed by federal investigators and claims she knew nothing of her husband's Boston bombing plans

New hire: Russell has retained attorney Joshua Dratel (center, speaking at a legal symposium in New York in 2010) who has represented a number of terrorism suspects

Expert: Joshua Dratel, pictured in 2004 with Maj. Michael Mori at Guantanamo Bay, defended detainee Australian David Hicks for alleged ties to terrorism based on Hicks' stay at an al-Qaeda training camp

Tamerlan Tsaranev's 24-year-old widow 
has been under increased scrutiny ever since federal officials found 
radical Islamist materials on her laptop, including the al Qaeda 
magazine Inspire.

Investigators
 also found traces of explosive residue in the Cambridge, Massachusetts,
 home Russell had shared with her late husband and their 3-year-old 
daughter.

Russell's defense 
team said in a statement that she 'plans to continue to meet with 
investigators, part of a series of meetings over many hours where she 
has answered questions.'

As of yet, Russell has not been 
charged with any crime but has beefed up her legal team with an expert in defending terrorist suspects.

Russell's attorneys have previously said she and her family were in shock when
 they learned of the allegations against her husband and brother-in-law,
 Dzhokhar.

Authorities, though, are said to be skeptical of her 
insistence that she played no role in the attack or in helping the 
brothers escape the authorities following the release of the 
photographs, according to a report by the New York Times.

Defense: Katherine Russell's Rhode Island based lawyer Amato DeLuca, left, with Russell on April 29 at DeLuca's law office in Providence, says the new lawyer was retained given his 'unique, specialized experience'

‘Mr. Dratel's unique, specialized 
experience will help insure that Katie can assist in the ongoing 
investigation in the most constructive way possible,’ DeLuca, Russell's Providence-based lawyer, said in a statement.

Miriam 
Weizenbaum, who similarly is based out of Rhode Island, is also on Russell's legal team.

The newest addition, Dratel, was the lead counsel for 
Australian David Hicks, who had attended the al-Qaeda linked, al-Farouq 
training camp in Afghanistan during 2001.

Hicks was detained at Guantanamo Bay and deemed an enemy combatant. He was convicted of providing support for terrorists and transferred to 
South Australia's Yatala Labour Prison in 2007.

Hicks, now 37, was released in December 2007 and 
is appealing his conviction in the U.S., on the basis that the military 
commission system created by Presidential Order was unconstitutional.

Dratel also defended Wadih el-Hage in connection to the 1998 Osama bin Laden backed bombings of the United States 
embassies 
in Kenya and Tanzania.

The American embassies in the East 
African capitals of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya killed 
223 and injured more than 4,000.

El-Hage, 52, was convicted in 2001 on several federal counts for his role in the attacks.

The convicted terrorist, a Lebanese
 born man who moved to the U.S. and became a citizen in 1989, is serving
 a life sentence at a federal prison in Florence, Colorado.

Dratel, a graduate of Columbia College and Harvard Law School, also was involved in the defense team in the case against suspected embassy bomber Mohamed Suleiman al-Nalfi.

Suspect: Russell's husband Tamerlan Tsarnaev, pictured in 2010, died after a gun battle with police

In 2004, Dratel had represented Sami 
Omar al-Hussayen, the Saudi computer science graduate student at the 
University of Idaho who was suspected of running websites that had links
 to terrorist organizations.

He
 was acquitted of charges relating to the terrorist affiliations but he 
was deported to Riyadh, where he now works as a teacher, on suspicion of
 immigration charges. 

In
 addition to Russell, Dratel is also currently representing Mohammad el-Mezain, a defendant in the federal prosecution of the Holy 
Land Foundation for Relief and Development - an Islamic non-profit 
organization that had been based in Richardson, Texas.

The fund was shut down on suspicion that it had been used to funnel money to Hamas and other Islamic terrorist organizations.

El-Mezain was convicted in 2008 on charges including material support to a foreign terrorist organization, providing material support to a foreign terrorist, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

Claims: Terror suspect Dzhokhar Tsranaev (left) told federal investigators that his sister-in-law, Katherine Russell (right), had nothing to do with the April 15 bombings that killed 3 and injured more than 260

Russell's brother-in-law, Dzhokhar

 Tsarnaev, has reportedly told investigators that Russell was not 
involved in the planning and execution of the deadly attacks on April 
15, that left 3 dead and injured more than 260. 

Dzhokhar's older brother was killed in a police gun battle April 19.

The 19-year-old Dzhokhar was captured and charged in connection to the
 bombings following a massive manhunt that ended. He was discovered 
wounded hiding inside a boat in a backyard.

He
 is charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass 
destruction resulting in death and with malicious destruction of 
property resulting in death.

Russell met Tamerlan while she 
was a student at Suffolk University, according to her lawyer. She 
converted to Islam and they married in 2010 before having a daughter, 
now three.
