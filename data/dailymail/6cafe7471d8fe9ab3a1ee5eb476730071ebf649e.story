Tiger Woods set himself up for another miraculous Major triumph by shooting an opening round of 69 to fire himself into contention at The Open.

Despite playing in just his second tournament since undergoing major back surgery in March – he missed the cut on his return two weeks ago – Woods insisted earlier this week that the only acceptable result for him at Hoylake would be victory.

That looked like nothing more than hubris on Thursday morning after the 14-time Major champion got off to a dreadful start at the venue where he won his last Open in 2006, bogeying both of the opening par fours amid some shoddy ball-striking.

But Woods was not fazed and appeared 
more visibly relaxed on the course than at any time in recent memory. 
The former world No 1 was even spotted smiling at the galleries at 
times, causing gasps of shock among seasoned Tiger-watchers used to his 
usual cold exterior.

Woods rallied with his first birdie of the day on the long fifth to head out in 36 strokes. As Rory McIlroy, Rickie Fowler and the game’s young guns raced into the lead, Woods’s score looked well short of what was required to challenge this week, but he stayed patient and hit a stunning patch of form on the back nine.

Three 
birdies in a row came from the 11th to the 13th holes. Then, despite a 
dropped shot at the 14th, Woods rallied to birdie both the next two 
holes.

On
 the par-five 15th he eased any fears over the state of his back by 
whipping through a full-blooded three-wood from the fairway. Although 
his ball missed short right of the green, his gossamer touch from the 
rough earned a brilliant birdie. Only a lip-out prevented another stroke
 gained on the 17th.

Another explosive three-wood on the long final hole found a bunker protecting the front of the green but he set up a chance to seal a back nine of 32 strokes with an act of escapology. The putt slid agonisingly wide of its target, however.

He said afterwards: 'I didn't exactly get off to the best of starts but I turned it around.

'I
 felt like someone could shoot 63 out there but the wind is picking up. 
The ball was dancing round all over the place out there.'

'I knew I could do it. That's why it was so important for me to play Congressional. I'm only going to get better.

'I felt fine, my warm-up was good. It was good being out there competing again.'

There are still three rounds left for Woods to complete but were the American superstar to win at Hoylake it would rank among his most stunning victories – of which there are plenty to choose from.Woods has not tasted victory in one of golf’s big four tournaments since 2008, when he won the US Open despite playing through the intense pain of stress fractures in his left leg and a torn cruciate knee ligament.

The pressure on him to break Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18 major titles is building after a six-year drought, and Woods is two shots behind the early pace set by Matteo Manassero, who held the clubhouse lead at five under par when Woods ended his round.

But the rest of the field will be all too aware that the big beast is back on the prowl.
