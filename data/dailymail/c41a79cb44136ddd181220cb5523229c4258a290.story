Jose Mourinho has landed a provocative blow ahead of Sunday's Stamford Bridge clash with Arsenal, claiming Cesc Fabregas already ‘loves Chelsea’ and has ‘no regrets’ about returning to a different part of London.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has claimed his former star’s priority was a summer move back to the Emirates from Barcelona.

But Chelsea boss Mourinho said: ‘I think he loves Chelsea already. He’s so happy: the way he plays, the way he’s a member of the squad, the way he lives in this little blue village. It is like he’s here for a long time.

‘If you ask him now if he regrets the move, I’m sure he’d say no. If you ask him if he’d choose a different option, he’d say no. And if you ask him where he thinks he’ll be in five years, he’d say he sees himself here in five years. He is Chelsea.’

Despite the protracted and unsavoury manner of Fabregas’s Arsenal departure in 2011, Wenger insisted ‘he is a person I love’ and called for fans to give him a ‘respectful’ reception.

But Wenger also claimed it was his decision to ignore Fabregas — and the buy-back option Arsenal held — once he learned he was willing to leave Barcelona.

Wenger’s call was shaped by the £42million signing of Mesut Ozil as a replacement, although the Arsenal manager also indicated that Chelsea had wrapped up a £30m deal by the time he was aware of his former captain’s availability. Wenger even suggested that the deal had been agreed ‘in early 2014’.

Asked if Fabregas wanted to return to Arsenal, Wenger said: ‘Certainly, yes. I don’t want to make a big story of that because you have to accept that. When he left, we bought Ozil. We were not in need of offensive players.

‘Cesc, when he looks back at his career, will find that Arsenal and myself had a very positive influence. I have no personal animosity against Fabregas. He is a person I love and a player I love.’

Mourinho believes the reception Fabregas receives from Arsenal fans will be insignificant if the home supporters get behind the former Gunner.

Mourinho said: 'If Chelsea fans want, the reaction from Arsenal fans, nobody will listen. It depends on Chelsea fans.

'If 40,000 blue fans want, no-one will listen to 3,000 red fans. It depends on the club culture. As you saw with Chelsea fans and Frank Lampard.

He added: 'Fabregas was – I don’t say born – but made at Arsenal and the feeling should be good between the fans and him but I don’t know.'
