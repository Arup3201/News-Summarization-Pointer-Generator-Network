Four people are dead and another 29 were wounded in yet another violent weekend of shootings across Chicago.

The deceased include a 28-year-old man executed in broad daylight on a busy street in view of a city politician, another man shot dead in front of his mother and two other men shot in the head, police said.

The wild weekend was then capped off with nine people among a fight of nearly 50 arrested for fighting at a popular beach and throwing beer bottles at responding officers, authorities said.

Cold-blooded: Eric Vaughn (left) faces several charges in the Saturday afternoon shooting death of William Lewis (right) on a busy North Side street that occurred in sight of a city politician

William Lewis, 28, was shot dead in front of dozens of horrified witnesses - including a city Alderman - on the relatively safe North Side.

Lewis was standing on the bustling West Devon Avenue commercial strip surrounded by families and Saturday shoppers around 3.30 p.m. when a male casually walked up and shot him in the back, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.

Alderman Joe Moore was among those enjoying the peaceful afternoon when he saw the shooter gun down Lewis.

‘This was a bustling commercial strip and it was the last thing I was expecting to see,’ Moore told WLS. ‘Until you do that, you don't really realize how incredible and how senseless it is.’

He and a number of others scrambled away to safety, but saw an even more sobering sight only a few hours later.

‘By
 the time we came back to the scene, one of the residents of the 
building immediately adjacent to the sidewalk was out there with a brush
 and water and bleach cleaning the sidewalk,’ said Moore.

‘That's something no one should have to do, not in any neighborhood in this city.’

Senseless: Lewis and his wife had moved to the neighborhood only two weeks ago

Just starting their life together: The happy couple was planning to soon start a family, according to a friend

Witness: City Alderman Joe Moore saw the shooting and was one of dozens of people who fled to safety, he called it 'senseless' and said it was 'the last thing' he was expecting to see

Where it happened: West Devon Avenue was filled with shoppers and people walking along the busy street when the shots pierced through the afternoon's tranquility

Lewis had moved to the neighborhood with his wife only two weeks ago, and he was set to start a new job Monday as a photographer for Trunk Store, an online retailer, family told the Sun-Times.

‘He was looking to start a family. He was talking about having children,’ friend Warren Radar told the paper. ‘Everything was going right for him.’

The couple would have celebrated their two-year wedding anniversary at the end of the month, according to Radar.

‘He
 was excited to be in Chicago,’ Radar continued. ‘His death is 
absolutely unnecessary. Chicago is getting a real bad rap for this. It’s
 getting way too common.’

Chicago Police announced Monday the arrest of 31-year-old Eric Vaughn. 

He
 was charged with first-degree murder and a number of other counts 
related to his attempted getaway, according to a CPD news release.

No motive has been announced in the senseless killing, and investigators do not believe Vaughn knew Lewis.

Another of the shootings happened early Saturday morning when a mother and son got into an argument with a 47-year-old male while all three were in a South Side apartment, police told the Sun-Times.

The assailant left the apartment around 1.15 a.m. only to return a short time later and open fire on the 50-year-old woman and her son, shooting both in the chest, before fleeing.

Adarrius Thompson, 27, was pronounced dead at the scene, sources said. The mourning mother was rushed to a nearby hospital and is in serious condition. It is not known how the attacker new his victims.

The final murder victim of the weekend was a man believed to be in his 50s who was shot in the head just after 12.30 a.m. on the city’s gritty West Side.

Also early Monday morning, nine people were arrested on misdemeanor assault charges after two officers were hurt breaking up a massive fight on Montrose Beach.

Nearly 50 people were involved in the melee on the North Side beach, cops told WMAQ. Beer bottles were flying through the air and struck two officers.

A total of 27 people have been shot dead in July alone, according to a website dedicated to tracking the city's prolific gun violence. Just over 180 people are dead and nearly 1,100 injured from the city’s seemingly never-ending gun violence on the year.

Police have not arrested suspects in any other of this weekend’s incidents.
