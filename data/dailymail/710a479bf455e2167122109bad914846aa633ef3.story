A girl of 15 died of tuberculosis after GPs told her family to send her to a spiritual healer because she was ‘lovesick for a boy’.

Despite crippling illness which left Alina Sarag painfully thin and unable to walk, doctors repeatedly sent her home, telling her desperate family that her illness was in her mind or at most a stomach bug.

As a coroner yesterday slammed the doctors for ‘gross failures’ which contributed to her death, it emerged Alina made nine visits to her GPs’ surgery, three visits to a community health centre, and attended three different hospitals on four occasions in the months before she died.

Neglected: Tragic Alina Sarag died after her GP Dr Sharad Shripadrao Pandit failed to diagnose her with tuberculosis

Each time, doctors failed to test for tuberculosis, even though she had contracted the disease once before.

This neglect contributed to her death,
coroner Aidan Cotter said, and it was ‘likely’ she could have been 
saved if simple tests had been carried out. Her distraught family, who 
say their pleas for help were repeatedly ignored by ‘atrocious’ doctors,
plan to sue the NHS.

Alina, from Sparkbrook, Birmingham, 
was first diagnosed with TB in 2009 after a girl at her school 
contracted the illness. She was prescribed a course of antibiotics and 
believed it had cleared before being struck down again in July 2010 
after returning from a trip to Pakistan.

TB is at its highest level in the UK for more than 30 years, with 9,000 new cases last year alone, up five per cent from 2010.

Most people believe the disease was wiped out by antibiotics in the Fifties but it never totally went away and cases started increasing from the early Eighties.

Mike Mandlebaum, chief executive of the charity TB Alert, said: 'TB is a disease usually associated with certain high-risk groups such as
those with HIV, those from Eastern bloc countries and Asia, and those 
living in crowded living conditions. But anyone can get it.'

London has the highest infection rate in Britain. The disease is often brought into the
country by visitors from India, South-East Asia and Africa, and it is
also common amongst the homeless and drug users.

Last month the UK Government said foreign travellers entering the UK from 
countries with high incidence of tuberculosis will have to go through a 
screening for the disease before being granted a visa.

The disease is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria and differs according to where the infection takes hold. Most TB affects the lungs but around 40 per cent of cases involve disease elsewhere.

It is spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes and the bacteria is breathed in by someone close by.

Some people who are infected never develop symptoms - although the bacteria remain in the body, they are not infectious.

This is known as latent TB and can develop into the active form of
the disease years after the original infection, triggered by impaired
immunity, being underweight, stress or uncontrolled diabetes.

Over the next four months, Alina 
became increasingly sick. Her weight plummeted to less than eight stone 
and she could stomach little more than baby food.

At one point, Alina was referred to a 
psychiatrist because doctors, who received 46 phone calls from her 
parents over this time, believed her sickness may have been caused by 
bulimia.

Her distraught father, Sultan Sarag, 
claims he was told by one GP, Dr Sharad Pandit, that he was 
‘mollycoddling’ his daughter and that she was just ‘lovesick’.

In December 2010, a psychiatrist 
reported back that her illness was physical rather than mental, but her 
doctors still failed to test for TB.

Less than a month later, Alina was no 
longer able to walk. On January 6, 2011, she was rushed to hospital 
suffering breathing difficulties and died later that day.

The 
pathologist who carried out the post-mortem examination said her lungs 
were ‘the worst we have ever seen’.

Alina’s family wept yesterday as a 
verdict of natural causes contributed to by neglect was read out at 
Sutton Coldfield Town Hall.

Mr Sarag, 43, said: ‘I don’t know how I
will ever trust medical professionals again after the heartache they 
have put me and my family through.

'Alina deserved far better. We went 
back time and again pleading with the doctors to help her but each one 
of them let her down.

‘I miss her so much. I still wait for her to come through the door after school.’

Mr Cotter cleared Birmingham Chest 
Clinic, a community health facility in the city, and four hospitals of 
any gross failure in their treatment of Alina up to October 2010 because
tests at this stage may not have detected the illness.

Alina became unwell after a holiday to Pakistan in the summer of 2010 and was seen by two different GPs in the following months

He said it was more likely than not, 
however, that Alina would have tested positive for TB by December 8, 
2010, by which time GPs had been told by a psychiatrist that Alina’s 
illness was not mental.

Mr Cotter said: ‘Treatment could and 
should have been started at that time. In my judgment it was a gross 
failure not to refer Alina so that tests could be carried out to 
establish whether she had active tuberculosis.’

Mr Cotter said he would write to 
medical training organisations to voice concern that some of the doctors
did not seem to be fully aware that latent TB can be made active by a 
subsequent and different illness.

Alina’s family’s solicitors, Irwin 
Mitchell, yesterday confirmed they had reported Dr Pandit to the General
Medical Council and will sue the NHS for damages.

Dr Pandit, who treated Alina from 
birth at Birmingham’s Highgate Medical  Centre, previously told the 
inquest that  Alina’s symptoms did not suggest she had TB in late 
October 2010, around 11 weeks before her death. He also denied telling 
her parents she was simply ‘lovesick’.

Another GP at the Highgate surgery, Dr
Khalid Iqbal, told the court he believed Alina did not have active TB 
when he saw her on four dates in September and October 2010.

The inquest
also heard that Dr Iqbal eventually referred Alina to Birmingham 
Children’s Hospital but did not pass on details of her history of latent
TB in his referral letter.
