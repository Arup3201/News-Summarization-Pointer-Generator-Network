It sounds like it could have come straight from the script of a  Midsomer Murders episode.

For ten years elderly residents of the Georgian market town of Holt have been terrorised by poison pen letters dropping on their doormats.

The chilling letters, which are handwritten and filled with profanities, contain threats for them to leave their homes.

Mystery: The letters have been sent to residents of Holt, Norfolk, for a decade, threatening elderly and urging them to leave their homes

At least 15 have been posted in the  Norfolk town, with no clue as to who was responsible or why.

All that was known was that, based on the handwriting, they appeared to have been written by the same person.

One extract, released by police, reads: ‘The longer you leave it, the sooner you will have to vacate the property.’

Now, the net could be closing in after a local newspaper put examples of the offending material on posters in the town and offered a £1,000 reward for information.

About 50 people responded and police have questioned a local man. One resident, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Whoever is behind it, I hope it ends soon. It’s a nasty business and completely out of place in Holt.’

Threats: At least 15 elderly residents have received letters such as this one, all apparently written by the same person

The unsigned letters – written in blue ink and with distinctive, unusually scripted ‘p’s – appear to have started dropping onto doormats about ten years ago.

One unfortunate household has received two. According to police, the personal nature of the letters indicates the author knows who they are writing to.

Paul Reed, 44, who runs P&S Butchers on the high street, said: ‘My wife’s grandparents have been receiving them. They were telling them to get out of their house and they were quite horrible.

‘They just ignored them at first but as they kept coming we said they should speak to the police.

‘One guy said he’d been receiving these letters since 2004.

‘Quite abusive with f-words and the like. Another man said his wife has been receiving letters using her maiden name, falsely accusing him of having an affair with women at work.’ Theories in the town are rife about what the possible motive could be.

‘Maybe it is someone with a grudge or someone who wants their neighbour out,’ said June Wood, 78.

A life-long resident, who would only give his name as Chris, suggested: ‘It’s probably a crackpot property developer trying to drive house prices down.’

Postman Ben Trent, 26, revealed he had been approached by Norfolk Police to make use of his local knowledge but was unable to help.

‘I don’t recognise the writing but handwritten letters are rare these days,’ he added.

And Erik Rees, a handwriting expert with the British Institute of Graphologists, provided a profile of the suspect, saying the person is ‘highly introverted with signs of paranoia and has pent up emotions with difficulty in expressing himself’.

Sending threatening letters carries a maximum six-month jail term or a £5,000 fine under the Malicious Communications Act.

The culprit could also be prosecuted under harassment legislation or be made subject of a restraining order.
