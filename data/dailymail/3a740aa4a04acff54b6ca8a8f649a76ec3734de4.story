It might now officially be Spring, but the weather has taken a turn for the worse - with flurries of snow replacing sunshine across Yorkshire.

The snow was captured falling through the air and settling on the ground in the small market town of Middleham, North Yorkshire, today.

And forecasters warn the flurries are likely to continue into the evening - with ice and freezing temperatures also expected overnight across the UK, particularly in the north.

Chilly conditions: The snow could be seen falling through the air, before settling in a fine sheet on the ground. Above, Middleham's high moor is pictured this morning

Getting frosty: The horses, which have been trained in the town in Richmondshire for more than 200 years, did not appear to be fazed by the unusually snowy conditions

This morning, race horses and their riders could be seen battling snowfall as they exercised at first light on the gallops in Middleham.

The horses, which have been trained in the town for more than 200 years, typically use the extensive gallops on the high moor in dry or rainy conditions.

But they did not seem fazed by the snow flurries as they made their way from their stables to the training ground.

The Met Office has warned icy patches are likely to develop across the country tonight as wet surfaces freeze under clear skies - with severe weather warnings in place in parts of the north, including Yorkshire and Cumbria.

Riding: Forecasters warn the snow flurries are likely to continue into the evening - with ice patches also expected overnight across the UK, particularly in the north

Training: Meteorologist Krista Mitchell said the snow blasts had mainly struck  high ground - but added: 'It is completely possible that there have been some in Yorkshire'

Meteorologist Krista Mitchell said 
'scattered blustery showers' will also continue in the UK overnight, where they 
will fall as snow over high areas of ground.

'We have seen snow blasts on higher ground - mainly confined to hills and other areas over 300m - but it is completely possible that there have been some on lower ground in Yorkshire today,' she said.

'This is likely to continue for the rest of the afternoon and tonight. Meanwhile, we have also seen scattered showers, with hail and thunder and lightning over the Midlands.

'Clear spells between showers will lead to a cold night with ice patches and frost across the country, especially in the north.'

Sunshine: It comes as much of Britain has experienced an unseasonably warm and dry March. Above, Tallulah Gibbard, three, runs among daffodils in Penwith, Cornwall

Playful: Meteorologists in southern England recorded a 16-day stretch without a drop of rain. Above, Sequoia Gibbard, 20 months, is pictured playing in the sun-lit field

She added that winds were easing over much of the country - with warmer temperatures and occasional sunny spells expected to return in coming days.

It comes as Britain has experienced an unseasonably warm and dry March following the wettest winter on record. Temperatures have soared to 20C (68F) on two consecutive weekends, while unbroken blue skies have been seen in most areas. 

This week, meteorologists in southern England 
recorded a 16-day stretch without a drop of rain - meaning that the country officially experienced a drought.

Having fun: The weather saw families streaming on to beaches, while others brought out barbecues. But it eventually gave way to cold and rainy conditions on Thursday

Meanwhile, plant centres said their sales had ‘gone bananas’, as homeowners took advantage of the weather to tidy up their bedraggled and windblown gardens.

However, the sunny weather eventually gave way to cold and rainy conditions on Thursday.
