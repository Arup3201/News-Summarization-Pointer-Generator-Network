BBC pundit Mark Lawrenson has been heavily criticised after he speculated that convicted rapist Ched Evans was a 'victim' after his move to Oldham Athletic collapsed at the last minute.

The former Liverpool and Ireland defender has been called 'vile' and 'a mug' after his comments on Football Focus on Saturday.

He said: 'It's become a circus, almost, and I'm just saying from everything I've read this week sometimes you're actually thinking, is he (Evans) a victim? It's just been madness.

Criticism: Mark Lawrenson has been attacked online after he speculated whether Ched Evans was a 'victim'

Opinion: Mr Lawrenson appeared on Football Focus on Saturday and said: 'It's become a circus, and I'm just saying from everything I've readsometimes you're actually thinking, is he (Evans) a victim?'

'There's no argument that the FA need to come out with guidelines. They have been conspicuous by their absence. There should be something set down - you can't go anywhere near people like Ched Evans until everything has been resolved.'

Evans was on the brink of returning to professional football with Oldham last week.

But on the eve of the deal being signed the League One club pulled out blaming 'enormous pressure from sponsors and threats to staff and their families'.

An unnamed director at the club was allegedly told his own daughter would be raped if the former Welsh international was allowed to play.

More than 70,000 people signed a petition opposing the Oldham deal but there has been a trickle of support for the disgraced former Wales and Sheffield United striker.

Premier League managers Harry Redknapp and Steve Bruce both said he should be allowed to return to football.

And at Oldham's match with Doncaster Rovers on Saturday there were some chants of 'One Ched Evans' and 'Sign him up', and one banner read: '70,000 where are you?'.

The BBC has responded to criticism of Mr Lawrenson.

A spokesman said: 'Mark was contributing to a wider discussion in which he was highlighting the media frenzy this week. In no way was he claiming Ched Evans was the victim, which is apparent in the full context of the conversation.'  

The footballer himself spoke out after the deal collapsed blamed ‘mob rule’ for scuppering the deal, and claimed his silence had been ‘misinterpreted as arrogance’.

And he did finally apologise to ‘the woman concerned’ – but continued to maintain his innocence.

Yesterday it emerged that Evans could face a further 14 months out of football if he continues his fight to clear his name.

Former Sheffield United player Evans has been shunned by several football clubs since he left prison after two-and-a-half years following his conviction for the rape of a 19-year-old woman.

Now it appears his best hope of returning to the game appears to be having his conviction overturned. This could take more than a year to get to the Court of Appeal and will mean Evans will not have played a professional game for four years.

Because he is still on licence Evans is also barred from leaving Britain for extended periods, which has led him to put his wedding plans on hold.
