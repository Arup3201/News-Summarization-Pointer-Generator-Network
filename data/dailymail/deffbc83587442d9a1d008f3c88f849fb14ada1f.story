England's 
Adam Peaty needed just three hours' sleep in between setting two 
Commonwealth Games records as he followed up his 100metres breaststroke 
gold medal with an impressive display in the 50m heats.

The
 19-year-old swam 27 seconds flat to beat world-record holder Cameron 
van der Burgh by 0.39secs and break his own British record for the 
second time in 14 hours.

Peaty
 had struggled to come down following the high of his triumph on 
Saturday night, but that was not evident at Tollcross as he raced home 
in his favoured event.

Disbelief: Peaty is shocked after setting another record during his powerful showing in 50m heat

'I didn't get to sleep until 4am and I got here at 7am, so I only got about three hours' sleep,' he said.

'I woke up this morning thinking, 'did that really happen?' But I just came back here and gave it my best.

'I
 haven't quite recovered from last night. I just have to put it behind 
me and focus on the Games. Celebrations are reserved for after.

'I
 didn't really expect to swim that fast this morning. I just went out 
there and enjoyed it and tried to keep my cool, and it's paid off.

'I
 just need to focus on the 50m now. It's what I've been training all 
year for. There's no point squandering it now, just because I've won the
 100m.'

Scotland's
 200m gold medallist Ross Murdoch won his heat ahead of Australian 
Christian Sprenger, who has been struggling with a shoulder injury, in 
27.44.

Jazz Carlin set a new Commonwealth Games record in qualifying for Monday night's 800m freestyle final.

The
 Welsh swimmer finished more than 11 seconds ahead of the nearest rival 
in her heat to touch home in 8:22.69, but promised she had more to give 
in the final.

Record-breaker: Carlin set a new Games record in the women's 800m at Tollcross on Sunday

Carlin,
 who finished sixth in the 200m final, said: 'I wanted to come in and 
have a good swim after having two days off, but also save something for 
(Monday) night.

'I
 felt like I was by myself, so when I've got a race I feel that's really
 going to push me on. I know I can recover by (Monday) night.'

Hannah Miley and fellow Scot Camilla Hattersley were the only other home nations competitors to make the final.

Miley
 earlier won her 200m individual medley heat as she looks to add to her 
400m gold, but it was the prolific Siobhan-Marie O'Connor who qualified 
fastest for the final in 2:11.42.

O'Connor, who has three silvers and a bronze so far, finished more than three seconds ahead of Emily Seebohm in her heat.

England's
 Aimee Willmott trailed Australian Alicia Coutts in her heat but 
qualified comfortably along with team-mate Sophie Allen.

English
 teenager Sophie Taylor bounced back from her failure to reach the 200m 
breaststroke final with the fastest time in 100m qualifying (1:07.77).

Molly
 Renshaw also qualified for the semi-finals, but Allen missed out while 
Katie Armitage was the fastest of three Scots to make the last 16.

Qualified: England's Lauren Quigley sealed her spot in the women's 200m backstroke final

Earlier, English pair Lizzie Simmonds and Lauren Quigley both qualified for the 200m backstroke final.

Simmonds,
 who came fifth in the 100m final, was the second fastest qualifier 
behind Canada's Hilary Caldwell, who swam 2:09.47, while British 
champion Quigley was four seconds slower as she grabbed the final place 
in a race that will include three Australians and three Canadians.

England's
 Fran Halsall, who won 50m freestyle gold, finished just outside three 
of the Australia team that broke the 4x100m freestyle relay world record
 on Thursday during qualifying for the individual event.

Her team-mates Amy Smith and Becki Turner also qualified for the semi-finals along with Hannah McCarthy of Wales.

South African Chad Le Clos set the fastest time in the 100m butterfly heats in 52.68 seconds - hours after winning the 200m.

England's
 Adam Barrett was fourth fastest, while team-mates James Guy and Joe 
Roebuck also qualified for the semi-finals along with Tom Laxton of 
Wales and the Isle of Man's Grant Halsall.

Scotland won their men's 4x200m freestyle heat, but Australia were more than six seconds faster in the other heat.
