Banned: Keighley Harris, 21, hurled a flower pot at a window and attacked a police officer in her shoplifting spree

A 21-year-old shoplifter has been banned from every major store in her town after a five-week crime spree.

Keighley Harris targeted five different shops, taking a range of items including perfume, hairdryers, saucepans, alcohol and children’s clothes.

On one occasion she even hid stolen goods in a wheelchair as she was pushing a male friend – who was only  pretending to be disabled – around a  garden centre.

When the pair were challenged by staff Harris threatened to attack them.

On another occasion Harris racially abused a police officer who arrested her from her home following a drunken disturbance.

Harris, of Worcester, has now been handed a CRASBO for the offences in January this year, banning her from entering two retail parks, two garden centres and two supermarkets in Warndon, a small parish town.

She is also banned from using foul abusive or racist language or gestures or being threatening, intimidating or aggressive towards anyone not of the same household as herself.

Worcester Magistrates Court heard that on January 4 Harris stole a bottle of whiskey from Tesco in the town.

Eight days later on January 12 she stole three hairdryers from Argos.

In January 20 she attempted to steal perfume from Asda and three days later she stole saucepans from Homesense.

On February 10 she and her male accomplice, Christopher Smith, 32, struck Bessingham garden centre in the town.

She has now been handed a CRASBO barring her from two retail parks, two garden centres and two supermarkets

Harris targeted a number of shops in just five weeks, attempting to steal anything from saucepans to perfume

Smith posed as a disabled shopper and was pushed around the store in a wheelchair by Harris.

A West Mercia Police spokesman said: 'She had pushed a male accomplice, who was feigning a disability, around in a wheelchair.

'They selected three items of children’s clothing which he [Smith] concealed by sitting on. When challenged she threatened to assault a member of staff.'

One another occasion she threw a flower pot at a relative’s window and threatened to burn down another family member’s house.

In one incident during the spree this year, she pushed a male accomplice in a wheelchair pretending he was disabled as they spun around the shop trying to hide items in the chair

On April 4 she was handed the CRASBO as well as a 12-month community order, a drug rehabilitation order, a supervision order.

She was also handed a 12-week curfew order banning her from going out at night.

If Harris breaches the CRASBO she can be jailed for up to five years.

Meanwhile Smith, of Worcester, was jailed for four weeks after he admitted three counts of theft, one for the incident with Harris and one of a camera from PC World and another a TV from Sainsburys.

He also admitted one count of attempted theft and one of commissioning an offense while serving a suspended sentence.
