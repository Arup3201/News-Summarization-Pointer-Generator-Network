Stung by the Australian foreign minister's attempt to ban them from the G20 summit this year, Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs took to Twitter to have a go at Julie Bishop herself.

But the joke was on them at the end of the Twitter tirade, when Australia's ambassador in Russia ridiculed the ministry right back for confusing Ms Bishops gender, while adding in his own quip about their controversial presence in Ukraine.

'The Australian FM's idea not to invite Russia to the G20 summit is not surprising but he should not lose sight of its principles,' Russia's MFA tweeted, quoting their own foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov.

Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted the offending tweet when it took to Twitter to warn Ms Bishop against trying to ban Mr Putin from the G20 world summit in Brisbane

Sweden's foreign minister Carl Bildt was first to notice the gender confusion and quickly tweeted in response: 'You should know that Australia FM Julie Bishop is not a 'he'. Fairly basic.'

Paul Myler, Australia's ambassador located in Moscow, thanked Carl with his own loaded Twitter comment.

'Thanks Carl! Borders, genders – all a bit confusing right now!' Mr Myler said.

Mr Myler is not the only national ambassador on Twitter taking aim at Russia over their growing presence in Ukraine.

The Canadian Joint Delegation to NATO tweeted its own tongue-in-cheek advice to Russia in the form of a map which locates and labels Russia, while Ukraine is labelled 'not Russia'.

'Geography can be tough. Here's a guide for Russian soldiers who keep getting lost and "accidentally" entering #Ukraine,' the delegation wrote.

The map was posted in light of Russian military sources claiming that ten of the country's soldiers who were caught in Ukraine, had crossed the border 'by accident'.

It has since been re-tweeted more than 40,000 times and favourited by almost 20,000 people.

Ms Bishop will continue in her quest to ban Mr Putin from attending the G20 meeting in November despite the pressure from Russian officials, AAP reports.

Alongside Defence Minister David Johnston, she is expected to use the NATO summit in Wales later this week to lobby other G20 nations to help block the Russian leader from the forum.
