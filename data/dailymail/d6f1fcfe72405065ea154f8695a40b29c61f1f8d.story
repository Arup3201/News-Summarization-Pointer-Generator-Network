MATT LAWTON: Malky Mackay and Iain Moody investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff 

Wigan Athletic have lost their back-of-shirt sponsor Premier Range following the controversial appointment of manager Malky Mackay.

The local kitchen firm, which carries a logo on the back of the Championship club side's kit, said that it had been left in an 'untenable position'.

And, on Thursday night, another sponsor iPro Sport also severed their ties with the Championship club. 

Despite an ongoing FA investigation into a series of racist, sexist and homophobic texts exposed by Sportsmail, Mackay has been handed another chance in management 11 months after leaving Cardiff City.

'I would ask people to judge me when they see me. I've apologised for my mistakes I've studied diversity and that's something that's ongoing.

'It has been a difficult period and I have made mistakes. I hope that in my time at Wigan, the people of Wigan and the supporters see who I am and see that I'm someone that desperately wants the club to do well.' 

Premier Range only started their sponsorship deal with the Latics in July, after formerly being associated with Burnley.

The partnership was the first time that Wigan have carried a back of shirt sponsor in their history - with the Lancashire based firm's website appearing above players' names.

At the time, Martin Mensforth, Director at Premier Range said: 'We think it’s very important for local businesses to support local teams as it can only add to the fabulous sense of community already surrounding a great side.'

Mackay, who was confirmed as the new manager of Wigan on Wednesday, will be hoping his side can bounce back from two consecutive defeats on Saturday.

A statement from iPro Sport released on Thursday said: 'iPro Sport  is passionate about supporting professional football and in particular Championship football. In fact, iPro Sport is the stadium sponsor to Derby County Football Club and hydration partner to over half the clubs in the Football League supplying all natural isotonic sports performance drinks to a large number of teams.

'The company has been a supporter of the team and fan base at Wigan FC and had looked forward to a long and fruitful relationship with the club as its hydration partner. However, the recent decision to appoint Malky Mackay as the club's new manager in the light of the Football Association's investigation into racist, sexist and homophobic text messages that he apparently sent while manager at Cardiff City, is at odds with the company's business ethics and commitment to best practice.

'iPro Sport actively encourages positive working relationships that are not based on colour, race, nationality, religious belief, sexual orientation or age and cannot condone racism, sexism or homophobia. As a result, it is with deep regret that iPro Sport will be severing its relationship with Wigan Athletic Football Club.'

Wigan chairman Dave Whelan revealed Mackay’s rolling contract includes a clause that protects the club in case the FA end up punishing their new manager.

The FA investigation is still two or three weeks away from completion and while disciplinary officials have to decide whether to differentiate between public and private communication, the most senior officials at Wembley want to see action taken. At the same time, a Cardiff investigation into eight transfers completed during Mackay’s tenure is also ongoing.

At the unveiling Whelan said: ‘We have spoken to the FA. I don’t think there is anything in the pipeline with the investigation but it’s in the contract (with Mackay), we are protecting the club.

‘I did ask Malky questions about the problems he’s had on the racist thing. He admits what he did and apologised for what he said. I accept that totally.

‘I think Malky has been so unlucky. He has done a little bit wrong and has apologised for it. It’s not like we are all saints.’

In one of the texts, Mackay, 42, described his former Cardiff owner Vincent Tan as ‘a chink’ and others referred to women, Jews and ethnic minorities in extremely derogatory terms.

'Fkn chinkys. Fk it. There's enough dogs in Cardiff for us all to go around.'

As Mackay was being unveiled in the North West, anti-racism organisation Kick It Out criticised Wigan’s appointment, saying: ‘Wigan have disregarded the ongoing investigation being undertaken by the FA, and any potential punishment Mackay may face, by taking the decision to appoint him.

‘We need to see leadership and a respect for the processes in place shown by football club owners to demonstrate how seriously they take tackling issues of exclusion, prejudice and discrimination.’ Coincidentally, Kick It Out staged an equality and diversity session for Wigan’s apprentices yesterday.

Local MP Lisa Nandy had previously written to Whelan asking him not to consider Mackay as a replacement for Uwe Rosler, who was sacked a week ago.

We wish to make it clear The FA investigation into the conduct of Malky Mackay and Iain Moody remains ongoing and no assurances have been given by The FA as to the outcome of this case.

In the particular and exceptional circumstances of this case, The FA would like to provide some clarification as to the status of the investigation.

The FA did not come into possession of the relevant evidence relating to the messages until mid-October.

This came out of many thousands of emails and texts and we are still in the process of obtaining additional information.

The FA is still investigating whether these messages indicate a culture in which other acts of a discriminatory nature may have taken place.

This process inevitably takes time.

Both Mr Mackay and Mr Moody are fully co-operating with the ongoing process.

We fully appreciate the need to act expeditiously on this matter.

However, it remains a complex investigation and The FA will make no further comment at this time.
