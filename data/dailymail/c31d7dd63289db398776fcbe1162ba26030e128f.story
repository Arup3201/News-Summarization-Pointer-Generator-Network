A 26-year-old Russian woman has been accused of attempted murder after she forced her ex-boyfriend's car off the road.

Mary Artemyeva allegedly flew into a jealous rage when she spotted her former partner Chariton Anisimov, 28, on the road with his new girlfriend.

Artemyeva revved up her engine and rammed into her ex-boyfriend's car on a road in central Russia's Volgograd Oblast. 

Bunnyboiler 2.0: Mary Artemyeva, 26, saw her ex Chariton Anisimov, 28, on the road with his new girlfriend in central Russia's Volgograd Oblast, and rammed into his car

The incident was filmed by a fellow driver on a dashboard camera, and the video shows Artemyeva ramming into the car from the side, forcing it up onto the central reservation.

Mr Anisimov, who had his new girlfriend in the car, can be seen attempting to accelerate away from his furious ex.  

But his Daewoo does not seem to be able to match the acceleration capacity of his ex-girlfriend's Mazda, and she quickly catches up with him and rams him again.

And this time he is not so lucky, with the car crashing onto the reservation and hitting a huge advertising hoarding.

The bonnet instantly crumples inwards and both Mr Anisimov and his new girlfriend had to be taken to hospital  with concussions.

The couple are expected to make a full recovery but are being kept in for observation.

Police spokesman Arkady Ignatyev said: 'We have arrested a young woman on suspicion of breaching traffic rules, intentional criminal damage and possibly attempted murder.'

'She was apparently very jealous after spotting her ex with a new woman and realising there was no chance they would get back together.'

Her licence they said had already been confiscated.
