Killer: Oba Chandler was convicted of raping and killing a mother and her teenage daughters in 1989 but now he has also been named the murderer of a 20-year-old woman found dead in 1990

A murderer who was executed for sexually assaulting and killing three women in 1989 has now been blamed for a different murder a year later.

Oba Chandler was executed in Florida by lethal injection in November 2011 at the age of 65, but detectives working on a cold case murder have found that he was guilty of another killing before being caught.

Chandler was arrested in 1994 and charged with the rapes and murders of a mother and her two teen daughters who were visiting Florida from Ohio on a trip to Disney World.

Joan 'Jo' Rogers and her daughters Michelle, 17, and Christie, 14, were last seen alive in June 1989 when they got lost on their way back to their motel.

They asked for directions from Chandler and police believe that he then sweet-talked them onto his boat before tying concrete blocks to their necks and legs and dropping them in the water.

Now police in Coral Springs have retested his DNA sample and found that he was connected to the previously-unsolved 1990 murder of Ivelisse Berrios Beguerisse.

Ms Beguerisse, 20, was found dead on November 27, 1990 at the side of a road in Coral Springs.

Cold case: Ivelisse Berrios Beguerisse was found dead at the side of a road in Coral Springs, Florida in November 1990 and the DNA that was taken at the scene was inconclusive until just new technology was used to test it

Sign of trouble: Ms Beguerisse's car was found with two slashed tires in the parking lot of the mall that she worked, leading police to believe that she had gotten a ride home from a Good Samaritan

She had last been seen at her job at a store called Swim Sports in the Sawgrass Mall and her car- which had two slashed tires, was found in the mall parking lot.

Her car suggested to investigators that she could have been offered a ride home from someone that turned into a trap.

'It was always suspected that the subject had lured her into a vehicle as a Good Samaritan and then later killed her,' Detective Dan Cucchi said to NBC Miami.

Chandler was familiar with the area of the crime, but did not live there at the time of the murder.

‘He had spent a couple months living in Sunrise, Florida just about a mile and a half from the Sawgrass Mills mall,’ Detective Brian Koenig said.

Sole conviction: Chandler was found guilty and sentenced to death for the rapes and murders of mother Joan 'Jo' Rogers (left) and her 17-year-old daughter Michelle (center) and 14-year-old daughter Christie (right) in 1989

Caught: Police were flooded with tips in the wake of the Rogers' murders but in 1994 Chandler (pictured) allegedly raped a Canadian woman who got away, and then she gave helped form a sketch of him for police

On top of the similar Good Samaritan factor and his connection to the area, the victim was also found with ligature marks on her ankles and wrists like those found on the bodies of the Rogers women.

Missing: Ms Beguerisse's body was found by two fishermen on November 27, 1990

DNA was collected off her body and after Chandler was questioned in connection to the Rogers triple murder in 1994, they also briefly considered him in relation to Ms Beguerisse's murder as well but the technology at the time could not connect the DNA samples.

Detectives Cucchi and Koenig were assigned the Beguerisse cold case last summer and asked to have the DNA retested.

On February 5, the results from the Broward Sheriff's Office came back saying that they obtained a positive suspect DNA profile.

The news gives closure to Ms Beguerisse's family, but can no longer change the final punishment that Chandler received, as he was put on death row in 1994 for the murder of Mrs Rogers and her daughters, and then killed less than a decade later.

He did not receive a single visitor during his years in jail, and there are mixed reports about whether or not he made a final statement.

Some say that he did not issue any statement while more than 30 people watched him die, while NBC Miami reports that he did have some final words: 'You are killing an innocent man'.
