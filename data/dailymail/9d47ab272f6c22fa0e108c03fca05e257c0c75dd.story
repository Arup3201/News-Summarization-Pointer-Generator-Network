Arsenal are baulking at the total cost of a swoop for Real Madrid midfielder Sami Khedira.

Having landed marquee signing Alexis Sanchez, the Gunners will now turn their attentions to signing a holding defensive midfielder.

Khedira, who has just 12 months let on his contract at Real, features highly on Arsene Wenger's midfield hit list.

Head boy: Sami Khedira is on Arsenal's radar but the Gunners could baulk at the £20m-plus asking price

Moving on: Khedira could play alongside Mesut Ozil next season and, right, the German in action against Brazil 

The club have made enquiries to gauge 
the cost of a deal for Khedira. And despite the German remaining a 
target, the financial outlay attached to the deal has cast doubt on a 
potential move.

The 27-year-old could cost in-excess of £20million despite the fact he has just 12 months left to run on his Madrid contract.

In addition, Khedira is understood to want at least £150,000-per-week, a package that would make him Arsenal's best paid player.

Arsenal have the financial capacity to complete such a move but committing £60million (including wages) to land Sanchez has taken a significant sum out of Arsene Wenger's transfer budget.

Likewise, the Gunners have also agreed to pay Newcastle £11million for right-back Mathieu Debuchy. And with a new goalkeeper, centre-back and striker still on Wenger's radar, a move for Khedira could prove a step too far.

Wenger is also hugely interested in Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Lars Bender. And a move for the Germany international is likely to have less strain on the club's finances.

Gunners chiefs have already made contact with Leverkusen executives about their interest in Bender. Should a move for Khedira or Bender not materialise, Arsenal will turn to Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin in their search for a new central midfielder.
