It’s a serious bruise - and this protester claims it was caused by a policeman shooting a rubber bullet at him as he rushed to help an injured Iraq war veteran during this week’s Occupy Oakland protests.

Shamus Collins showed off his bruise to other protesters yesterday at the demonstrators’ new camp - and it is clear evidence to suggest the police did fire rubber bullets, despite their consistent denials.

He rushed to the aid of former Marine Scott Olsen, 24, who was left in a critical condition after being hit by a projectile believed to have been thrown by police on Tuesday at the California protests.

Bruise: Occupy Oakland protester Shamus Collins claims he was shot with a rubber bullet as he went to the aid of injured Iraq war veteran Scott Olsen at a new encampment in Frank H. Ogawa Plaza in Oakland, California

Mr Olsen, who won medals in Iraq, has become a rallying cry for the Occupy Wall Street movement across the U.S. - and the picture of Mr Collins at Frank H. Ogawa Plaza will only heighten their anger.

Officials are investigating exactly where the projectile that hit Mr Olsen came from, but police have denied using rubber bullets to calm the protests - although admitted firing bean bags.

However two other protesters suggested rubber bullets were used, reported the Washington Post.

Jen Lasher posted a picture on Twitter showing a bruise that looks like it was caused by a rubber bullet - and Schuyler Erle tweeted a photo of what he claimed was a rubber bullet found in Oakland.

Meanwhile, a crowd of 1,000 people, many holding candles, gathered on Thursday night in Oakland to hold a vigil in honour of Mr Olsen, who is hospitalised with a fractured skull.

Twitter users and protest websites have been declaring since the incident: ‘We are all Scott Olsen.’

Joshua Shepherd, 27, a Navy veteran who was standing nearby when Mr Olsen got struck, called it a cruel irony that he is fighting an injury in the country that he fought to protect.

Despite the financial underpinnings of the protests, Mr Olsen himself wasn't taking part out of economic need. His friends say he makes a good living as a network engineer.

He is said to have an apartment overlooking San Francisco Bay, but felt so strongly about economic inequality in the U.S. that he fought for overseas that he slept at a protest camp after work.

‘He felt you shouldn't wait until something is affecting you to get out and do something about it,’ said his friend and roommate Keith Shannon, who served with Mr Olsen in Iraq.

Mr Olsen’s condition has been improving. Doctors transferred him from the emergency room to  intensive care and upgraded his condition to fair. He has since been described as 'awake and lucid'

By Thursday afternoon, he was interacting with his parents, who flew in from Wisconsin in the morning - doing maths equations and meeting Mayor Jean Quan, who stopped by to apologise.

His uncle said Mr Olsen's mother was trying to understand what had happened. ‘This is obviously a heartbreaker to her,’ George Nygaard said. ‘I don't think she understands why he was doing this.’

The group Iraq Veterans Against the War blamed police for Mr Olsen's injury. Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan said officials will investigate whether officers used excessive force.

Police have said they responded with tear gas and bean bag rounds only when protesters began throwing bottles and other items at them.

Mr Olsen was awarded seven medals while serving in the U.S. Marine Corps, which he left as a lance corporal in November 2009 after serving for four years. He moved to the Bay Area in July.
