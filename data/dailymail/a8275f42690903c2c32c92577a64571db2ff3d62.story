Should Alan Pardew remain in charge of Newcastle?

Martin O'Neill feels under-fire 
Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew owes a debt of gratitude to Irish 
midfielder David Meyler for turning the other cheek in Saturday's 
headbutt horror at Hull.

The Republic of Ireland boss hailed Meyler's responsible reaction to the weekend's biggest talking point.

'A
 lot of players may have reacted differently to David, that's what I 
think. I think Alan Pardew will be pleased that it was Meyler that he 
was dealing with,' said O'Neill.

What was he thinking? Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew headbutts Hull City player David Meyler

'I think David did very, very well for the Newcastle manager. Other players may have gone down.

'His
 own club manager Steve (Bruce) made reference to that.

'I know David and
 I think overall he did very, very well,' he 
added.

Pressed for his 
personal view on Pardew's actions, O'Neill said: 'I think if you don't 
mind I'll probably steer clear of that.

'It didn't 
look good.'

Meyler, who 
played for the Ireland boss at Sunderland, is not the sort of character to allow 
Saturday's incident affect him, according to O'Neill.

'I
 don't think that sort of thing will bother him. It doesn't seem as if 
he has stepped out of line in any way, not at all,' he said.

Pardew was left clinging to his job 
as Newcastle manager after the club fined him £100,000 and reprimanded 
him for the headbutt during an astonishing touchline 
bust-up.

Newcastle United are disappointed with the actions of its manager Alan Pardew this afternoon (Saturday, 1st March).

His behaviour was unacceptable and is not the behaviour we expect from the manager of Newcastle United.

It
 is most disappointing that this incident has taken the focus away from 
what was a fantastic performance by the team and an excellent result 
away from home which leaves the club in eighth place in the Barclays 
Premier League.

Sadly, 
the headlines tomorrow will not be focused on the result or the efforts 
of the players, but instead on the actions of our manager.

Alan
 unreservedly apologised immediately following the game to the player, 
to Hull City Football Club and its fans, and to the fans of Newcastle 
United.

We have held 
discussions this evening with Alan who has offered his sincere apologies
 to the Club and it is clear he deeply regrets his actions. Alan has 
accepted a formal warning from the Club in relation to his behaviour 
today and also a Club fine of £100,000.

The Club is now drawing a line under this matter and will be making no further comment.

The Newcastle manager was ordered to 
the stands in disgrace by referee Kevin Friend. Then, after his side’s 
4-1 victory, Pardew expressed his regret and said sorry for his actions.

Hours later he was fined £100,000 by his club and formally reprimanded for ‘unacceptable behaviour’.

But

 two of Newcastle’s past heroes, striker Alan Shearer and ex-manager 
Graeme Souness, publicly branded Pardew’s position at the club untenable
 and insisted United owner Mike Ashley had every right to 
tear up the 52-year-old’s contract, which has six years to run.

While
 his team celebrated victory, Pardew, who has a history of touchline 
confrontations with opposition managers, said: ‘I tried to ease him 
[Meyler] away and I put my head in a forward motion. You just can’t do 
that. I apologised to him, to everyone at Hull and in particular to my 
own fans.

‘It was a 
heat-of-the-moment thing. I just wanted to get the guy away from me but 
it was a forward motion and you can’t do that. I am not stupid enough to
 think there’s going to be no punishment. I just have to accept it.’

That
 punishment is almost certain to be considerable. The FA are taking the 
incident very seriously and Pardew faces a significant ban — quite 
possibly to the end of the season.

FA chairman Greg Dyke said: ‘It looks serious and we will investigate.’

Shearer, who played more than 300 times for Newcastle, called Pardew’s position at the club untenable. ‘What on earth can Alan Pardew say to his players when they misbehave?’ added Shearer. ‘I have never seen anything like that before, ever.

‘Frankly I wouldn’t be surprised, and I don’t think anybody will be surprised at all, if Alan Pardew were to resign over this.

‘Even if he doesn’t want to resign, the club might be saying to him, “We might be doing you a favour — you resign rather than us sack you”, because that will have to be in his thinking also.’

Souness added: ‘That is a sackable offence. I’ve been frustrated and upset by a number of things, but I’ve never gone down that road.'

November 2006: Pardew had earlier in the year criticised Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger for failing to field an English player in the Champions League match against Real Madrid and matters came to a head in West Ham's 1-0 win over Arsenal. Then West Ham boss Pardew's enthusiastic celebrations appeared to irritate Wenger, who claimed he was 'provoked in a disrespectful way', with the pair having to be kept apart by the fourth official. On this occasion, it was the Gunners boss who was fined by the Football Association, with Pardew cleared of all charges.

March 2012: In a Tyne-Wear derby, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the tension boiled over, with Pardew, now Newcastle boss, clashing with Martin O'Neill following his celebration to Shola Ameobi's late equaliser in a heated match. Both managers pledged afterwards to keep their emotions in check in future.

August 2012: Pardew came under severe criticism and then afterwards labelled his behaviour 'ridiculous' when he shoved linesman Peter Kirkup in the Magpies' season opener against Tottenham after disagreeing with the official's decision to award Spurs a throw-in. Pardew once again apologised for his actions but the Football Association took a dim view and hit him with a two-match touchline ban and a £20,000 fine.

January 2014: Pardew became involved in another touchline row, less than a month after having heated words with Southampton boss Pochettino, with Manchester City manager Pellegrini. Television cameras clearly showed the Newcastle boss launching an expletive-laden volley at the Chilean. Pardew was spared punishment but said later: 'It was a heat of the moment thing, words we always have as managers, to a degree. I've apologised and I'm fortunate that he's accepted that.'
