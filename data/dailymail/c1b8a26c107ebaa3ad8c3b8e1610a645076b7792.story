Key note speaker: Lord justice Leveson will make the 10,000-mile haul with his wife to give a key note speech at Sydney's University of Technology entitled 'Privacy in the 21st century' on December 7

Lord Justice Leveson is to take an 
all-expenses-paid trip to Australia to give a £620-a-ticket lecture on 
controlling the media - days after passing his judgement on the future 
of press regulation.

The High Court judge will make the 
10,000-mile haul with his wife to give a key note speech at Sydney's 
University of Technology entitled 'Privacy in the 21st century' on December 7.

He will make the address just eight days after the official publication, on November 29, of the first part of his long-awaited report from his epic probe into press standards and amid the likely firestorm that will 
ensue its publication.

The inquiry has heard months of evidence - some explosive - from key figures 
including celebrities, lawyers, politicians and journalists.

Details of the trip - and of the report's publication - emerged a day after Mayor of London Boris Johnson warned MPs against jettisoning centuries of British freedom by shackling the Press as a senior Cabinet minister openly mocked the inquiry into media standards.

Described in publicity as the 'Chair 
of the UK Leveson Inquiry', Lord Justice Leveson will be among a host of experts to speak 
at the day-long symposium, billed as 'one of the key privacy events of the year', according The Times.

He will then jet to Melbourne five days later to deliver a second oration on 'News
Gathering in a Time of Change'. Tickets for this event, which are free 
so long as audience members book in advance, have already sold out.

Margaret Simons, director of Melbourne 
University's Centre for Advanced Journalism, which is hosting the 
December 12 event, says in the release: 'Sir Brian's lecture will raise 
issues that must be at the heart of any discussion about the way 
journalists go about their work: how do we protect the vital role that 
journalists have in our liberal democracies and, at the same time, hold 
them to account for the ways in which they do their work?'

She told The Times of her 
surprise that Lord Leveson accepted her invitation, adding: 'Frankly, 
when I invited him I thought it was a million to one, but he said 
"yes".'

A spokesman for the Judicial Office said:  'Lord Justice Leveson has received invitations to speak from two universities in Australia in December.

'Unmissable': Described on the event's flyer (pictured) as the 'Chair of the UK Leveson Inquiry', Lord Justice Leveson will be among a host of experts to speak at the day-long symposium, billed as 'one of the key privacy events of the year'

'He
has accepted those invitations, subject to him having completed and 
published his Report by then and on the understanding that he is not 
going to speak about the content of, or the recommendations in, his 
report.  His travel costs will be met by the universities.'

Meanwhile, it was announced today that the long-awaited report from the first 
part of his wide-ranging probe into press standards will be released 
next Thursday in which he is expected to call for a new Press regulator backed by law.

Lord Justice Leveson and his panel of
advisors have heard months of evidence - some explosive - from key figures 
including celebrities, lawyers, politicians and journalists.

No censorship: Mayor of London Boris Johnson has told MPs to reject regulation of the press

Formal evidence started on November 
14, 2011, and, according to its website, the inquiry sat for a total of 
88 days up to and including June 30 this year.

The final report will reveal Lord Justice Leveson's recommendations for the future regulation of the British press.

The first part of the probe, which 
started in September last year, looked at the culture, practices and 
ethics of the press in general and its final report will be published at 1.30pm on November 29 followed by an 'on-camera statement', the inquiry announced today.

The inquiry said it will be available on its website once it has been laid in both Houses of Parliament.

But there are concerns that his recommendations could stifle press freedom, a liberty Britain has prided itself on for centuries.

Speaking at an awards ceremony last night, London Mayor Boris Johnson made clear his opposition to any form of state regulation of the Press.

He said MPs must resist the temptation to take revenge on the Press by imposing state regulation.

‘MPs, don’t you for a minute think about regulating the Press, which has been free in this country for centuries,’ he said at the annual Spectator magazine political awards in London, where he was named politician of the year.

He was cheered loudly by an audience comprising senior media and political figures, including Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Education Secretary Michael Gove.

Mr Gove, who was presenting the awards, took a swipe at Lord Justice Leveson by suggesting he needed ‘lessons in freedom of speech’.

He had clashed with the judge over Press freedom while giving evidence to the Leveson Inquiry earlier this year.

In
his speech yesterday Mr Gove, a former Times journalist, joked that 
Speaker’s wife Sally Bercow deserved the 'Lembit Opik memorial award for
distinguished contributions to moral seriousness in public life'.

He
also said her husband John deserved both the ‘Fox News Fair and 
Balanced award for perfect objectivity and the Kim Kardashian memorial 
thong for relentless self-effacement and shirking of the limelight'.

Turning
to the Leveson Inquiry, he went on: 'It’s also a pity that His Honour 
Brian Leveson cannot be here so he could receive the Bureau of 
Investigative Journalism award for commitment to truth-telling for his 
wonderful comments: "I don’t really need any lessons in freedom of 
speech, Mr Gove, really I don't".'

The
Bureau of Investigative Journalism helped produce the disastrous 
Newsnight investigation into child abuse that falsely suggested Tory 
peer Lord McAlpine had been involved in abusing boys at North Wales care
homes.

The organisation’s managing editor 
Iain Overton has since resigned over the affair. Its trustees include 
Sir David Bell, a senior adviser to the Leveson Inquiry.

During the inquiry the BIJ called for
a levy on the media to fund organisations like itself, which it said 
produced ‘gold standard’ journalism.

Speaking
during business questions in the Commons, Leader of the House Andrew 
Lansley said today: 'Lord Justice Leveson intends to publish his report 
on November 29, the Prime Minister plans to make a statement to the 
House subsequently.

'On Monday December 3, there will be a general debate on the Leveson Inquiry.'

Speaking
earlier, Culture Secretary Maria Miller urged MPs to await next week's 
publication before rushing to judgment on how to reform newspaper 
regulation, but she said the status quo was 'not an option'.

Speaking
at Commons questions, she added: 'The principles that will drive any 
solution to the problems we face with regards to the Press are that we 
need to have an independent regulator that needs to be tough and 
certainly doing everything to preserve free speech.'

Stinging: In his speech Mr Gove, a former Times journalist, joked that Speaker's wife Sally Bercow, right, deserved the 'Lembit Opik memorial award for distinguished contributions to moral seriousness in public life'

Labour's former culture secretary Ben 
Bradshaw accused Cabinet ministers of repeatedly trying to undermine 
Lord Justice Leveson's report in the run-up to publication.

Yesterday victims of Press intrusion 
and members of the Hacked Off campaign groups met separately with David 
Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg at Westminster to urge them to 
implement Lord Justice Leveson’s recommendations in full.

They
included Kate McCann and Chris Jefferies, who was caught up in coverage
of the investigation into the murder of Bristol landscape architect 
Joanna Yeates.

He said the party leaders had made clear the ‘status quo cannot be allowed to continue’ and were ‘all committed to change’.

Brian Cathcart, director of Hacked Off, said the three leaders had agreed that ‘radical change’ was needed in Press regulation.

He said they had agreed that a cross-party approach would be preferable, but they did not agree to a request from the group to hold cross-party talks before giving their responses to Lord Justice Leveson’s findings.

Meanwhile the architect of a new regulator of the Press proposed by the newspaper industry said that Richard Desmond, owner of the Daily Star and Daily Express, has agreed to sign up to the body.

One of the arguments against the existing Press Complaints Commission is that Mr Desmond’s newspaper group is currently no longer a member.

But Lord Black, a co-founder of the proposed new regulator alongside Lord Hunt, the PCC chairman, told BBC Radio 4’s The Media Show that there was widespread support for the new body which would be ‘the friend of good journalism and the scourge of bad journalism’.

Asked how the new regulator will get round the ‘Desmond problem’ and ensure full co-operation from all the main newspaper groups, Lord Black said: ‘I am confident that all publishers will sign up.’

Pushed by presenter Steve Hewlett on whether Mr Desmond had personally agreed to co-operate with the proposed new regime, Lord Black added: ‘Yes, he made that clear at the time of the Leveson Inquiry. He has made it clear since then.’
