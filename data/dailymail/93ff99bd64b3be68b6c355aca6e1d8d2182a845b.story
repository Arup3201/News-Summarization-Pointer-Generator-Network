Anger: Pauline Hayes is furious over husband Allan's treatment

An elderly dementia sufferer has been forced to move seven times in just over a year, leaving his wife fuming.

Pauline Hayes says she often finds husband Allan, 73, in tears when she visits him at his care home in Leeds.

The 72-year-old is furious that Allan has been moved from a purpose built unit because of a reorganisation within the local NHS Trust.

Allan was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2006 and his wife of 41 years cared for him in their home until last June.

He
has since been moved seven times something which has upset both him and
Pauline as she says his condition means he needs to be settled.

Allan
was first taken into a mental health in-patient facility called The 
Mount in Leeds but was able to return home after several weeks.

He
was forced to return following a water infection and was then 
transferred to an assessment bed in a care home, then back into 
hospital, then a different care home.

Most recently he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act for the third time and moved to Asket Croft.

Pauline
said the facility, which was purpose built for dementia patients, was 
ideal to meet his needs but unfortunately Allan was moved back to The 
Mount in early August.

It followed a decision made by  Leeds and York Partnerships NHS Foundation Trust, which provides mental health care in Leeds, to centralise in-patient dementia services there as part of a plan to create a ‘centre of excellence for older people’ and Asket Croft is to be redeveloped as a community hub for mental health services in east Leeds.

Mrs Hayes say that although the care provided at The Mount is good, the facilities are not and she questioned the judgement of moving patients away from a specially built facility.

‘The Mount does not have the lovely facilities that this purpose-built building had.

‘I want to know why they are closing these places but then re-opening them to someone else.’

‘It’s terrible. I know he’s safe at The Mount but it’s only a stopping place.’

She said it was devastating to see the
‘gentleman’ with whom she has four children and share six grandchildren
and two great grandchildren become a different person because of the 
disease.

‘Even last year he would say “I know it’s hard for you.”

‘Then this plateau drops and their mind just goes. It’s a horrible, nasty illness.’

Change: Pauline says her husband has been crippled by the 'horrible' illness, right, and is not the gentleman he was, left

A spokesman for Leeds and York 
Partnerships NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘The service at The Mount offers
far more treatment and activity and has access to the skills and 
experience needed including medical and pharmacy provision.

‘The
trust has also reinvested a large resource in both memory services, 
which will ensure that the need for beds reduces over time, and care 
home services, so staff can support those with more complex needs who go
into long term care.

‘Due 
to an increasingly ageing population we need to ensure we focus on 
earlier detection rather than waiting for people in crisis who then need
a bed.’

The spokesman added that the trust accepted more could be done to improve facilities at The Mount.
