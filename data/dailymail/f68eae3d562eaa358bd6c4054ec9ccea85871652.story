The MiG-27 is a ground-attack aircraft originally build and designed in the 1970s by the Soviet Union, but is now only used in India, Sri Lanka and Khazakhstan.

In February 2010, India temporarily grounded its 150-strong fleet after a crash in  Siliguri, West Bengal.

The Indian Air Force have said they plan to retire the MiG-27 by 2017.
