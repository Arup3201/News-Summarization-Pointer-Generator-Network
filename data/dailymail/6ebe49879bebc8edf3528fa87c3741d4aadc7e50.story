Barack Obama’s illegal immigrant uncle was in court today for a hearing over allegations he almost collided with a police car whilst drunk driving.

Onyango Obama allegedly stifled laughter at the huge media presence before a Massachusetts judge told him to return to court on November 17.

Obama, 67, has already pleaded not guilty to the charges and allegedly said he would call the White House when he was arrested in August.

Hearing: Onyango Obama, left, uncle of President Barack Obama, sits in Framingham, Massachusetts, District Court on Thursday

Framingham District Court Judge Robert V. Greco released Obama on personal recognisance after a short hearing, reported the Boston Globe.

He was called 'Uncle Omar' in President Obama’s book ‘Dreams from My Father’ and has allegedly been living illegally in the U.S. since 1992.

Obama’s attorney P. Scott Bratton told the Boston Herald that his client has returned to work at Conti Liquors in Framingham.

Obama was arrested after he allegedly nearly collided with an unmarked police patrol car near a fried chicken shop in Framingham, near Boston.

The policeman and another driver both slammed on their brakes after Onyango went through a stop sign, a judge heard at an earlier hearing.

Arresting officer Val Krishtal said 
Obama was 'moderately unsteady on his feet' and was unable to walk in a 
straight line or balance on one leg.

The President’s uncle also allegedly declared 'Maybe I should call the White House', when granted his prison phone call.

Neighbours said Obama’s pale yellow house in Framingham was always bustling with people and he would spend time on his front porch.

Family tree: Barack Obama is one of eight children his father Barack Obama Snr had. His 'Uncle Omar', is the son of Sarah Obama, his grandfather's third wife

Obama is believed to have come to the U.S. in 1963 to attend a high-profile prep school in Massachusetts.

But he dropped out and was ordered to leave the country in 1989. He appealed the decision - but in 1992, he lost.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said soon after Obama was arrested that he would not receive any special treatment.

In his autobiography, Barack Obama said ‘Uncle Omar’ was 'the uncle who left for America 25 years ago and had never come back'.

Relatively speaking: President Barack Obama, pictured on Wednesday, wrote about 'Uncle Omar' in his book 'Dreams from My Father'

Onyango Obama is the son of Barack Obama's grandfather Hussein Onyango Obama's third wife, Sarah.

Barack Obama's father, Barack Senior, was born to his grandfather's second wife, Akumu.

But the President calls Sarah 'Granny' because she raised his father.
