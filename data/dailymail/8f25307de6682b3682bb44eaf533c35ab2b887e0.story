Lionel Messi is the best player I’ve ever seen in the flesh and he has helped drag this Argentina team to the final. But it’s still difficult to watch the player he is now, compared to the one he was three or four years ago. I don’t buy the theory that he is better because he’s evolving.

Go and watch highlights of his peak years at Barcelona and he was absolutely electric. That pace and speed off the mark have gone. But for all that, he is still the main man and if Argentina are to win this World Cup, you have to look at Messi.

On his back: Lionel Messi may not be the player he was but he's carried Argentina to the World Cup final

Easing the burden: Sergio Aguero should play if he's fit - he's an asset to Lionel Messi

Coach Alejandro Sabella has a decision to make over Sergio Aguero. If he has had no injury reaction, he should play because he makes Messi a better player.

In Miroslav Klose, the Germans have an arch predator, and Thomas Muller is such a good all-round player. I don’t expect them to change their line-up.

MANUEL THE MARVEL

Germany have a huge advantage here. Sergio Romero may have been the semi-final shootout hero but Manuel Neuer could go down as one of the best goalkeepers we’ve ever seen.

He’s a great shot-stopper, commands his area better than anybody and is fantastic on the ball. You could see how angry he was about conceding against Brazil and that tells you everything about him.

Romero has been solid, but Neuer’s the real deal.

Real deal: Germany keeper Manuel Neuer has been outstanding throughout the tournament

Hero: Sergio Romero may have starred for Argentina in their shootout win over Holland but lacks Neuer's class

WILL ROJO GO LOCO?

Neither side is magnificent at the back, though Argentina have improved as the tournament has gone on.

I was not a Martin Demichelis fan, but he did very well to marshal Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie. Partner Ezequiel Garay is a real warrior and Pablo Zabaleta is excellent at right back, though there are question marks over Marcelo Rojo.

The Germans are slightly better and I would not be surprised to see Mats Hummels in the Premier League soon.

Top class: Argentina right-back Pablo Zabaleta is excellent but there are question marks over Marcelo Rojo

Steady: Germany fare slightly better at the back, while Mats Hummels could excel in the Premier League

Jerome Boateng too often looks like a last-ditch defender, something you can’t say about Philipp Lahm. Benedikt Howedes has done well, too, and overall the Germans have a better unit.

ARGENTINA’S WEAK LINK

This is the weakest area of the  Argentina side. Javier Mascherano is  trying to do everything: tackling, passing, creating. He’s a fine player but a destroyer, not a playmaker.

The lack of creativity in the middle is one of the reasons we haven’t seen Lionel Messi at his peak.

He’s been good but at Barcelona, with quick passes from Xavi and Iniesta, he’s even better.

Too much: Argentina's hard man Javier Mascherano is trying to be their playmaker to his team's detriment

What he does best: Mascherano blocks Holland star Arjen Robben's shot late in the semi-final

Argentina will have to pass the ball quickly or Germany will swarm all over them.

Germany have so many midfield options. Sami Khedira was excellent against Brazil and, though his inclusion over Mario Gotze is not one for the purists, he has improved the balance.

Argentina's weakest link is the pressure they place on destroyer Javier Mascherano to be a play maker
