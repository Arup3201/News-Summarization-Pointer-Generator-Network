A fleeing suspected car thief bit off more than he could chew Tuesday when he crashed into an alligator that happened to be crossing the road.

The unlucky reptile and 22-year-old Calvin Rodriguez collided as Rodriguez was trying to outrun the police in a stolen Honda Civic in Port St. Lucie, Florida. 

He wouldn't have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't that that pesky gator.

Calvin Rodriguez, 22, was arrested after crashing a stolen Honda Civic into an alligator

Officers say they had lost Rodriguez's trail as they pursued him Tuesday night. He had two pals with him in the car at the time.

But they found him - and his stolen ride - smashed into a guardrail a short time later.

He told officers that he lost control after crashed into the reptile. 

'It’s pretty unimaginable that police officers would be at that point in time looking for these suspects and that an alligator unfortunately just happens to cross the road and assist us in catching these criminals,' Detective Keith Boham told WPTV.

He had in his possession a set of 'shaved keys' that he said he used to steal Honda and Acura cars from the parking lots of supermarkets around the Port St. Lucie area.

Rodriguez is suspected of stealing a total of five cars before he was caught.

He told officers he would drive a stolen vehicle for several days, then ditch it and steal another.

He said he learned to swipe cars 'growing up in a tough town in Connecticut.'

Police said they do not know whether the alligator survive the crash.
