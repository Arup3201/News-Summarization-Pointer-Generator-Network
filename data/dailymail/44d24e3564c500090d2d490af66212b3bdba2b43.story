A drunk couple went on a rampage and beat up a social club secretary and his wife at a wedding reception after they flew into a rage after he burst balloons near their sleeping daughter.

Mother-of-three Sarah Etchells, 43, began ranting at 76-year-old Harold Foulkes after he burst the balloons near the child while he was cleaning up after the reception at the Railway Club in Farnworth near Bolton, Greater Manchester.

Although he apologised, the argument descended into violence when Mr Foulkes and his wife Eileen, 75, were set up on by Etchells and her husband Nick, 52, as the elderly couple tried to take staff home.

Harold Foulkes was left with a number of injuries from the attack including bruising to both eyes, severe facial swelling and bruising, a cut top lip and a cracked tooth

Mr and Mrs Foulkes were beaten during the melee before Mrs Etchells climbed into their car through the rear door where three women, including a pregnant barmaid were sitting.

Mr Foulkes was punched in the face knocking off his spectacles and hearing aid. He also suffered bruising to both eyes, severe facial swelling and bruising, a cut top lip and a cracked tooth.

His wife suffered a large bruise to her left temple and other minor facial injuries while the pregnant woman sustained a three-inch scratch to her chest.

Today a judge branded the Etchells’ behaviour as 'disgusting' as they admitted violence and public order offences.

Mrs Etchells of Farnworth wept as she pleaded guilty to three counts of common assault and criminal damage and was given a 12 month community order and was ordered to complete 250 hours of unpaid work.

Her painter and decorator husband and another man Dale Hughes, 27, a fork lift truck driver also of Farnworth, were found guilty of one count of assault following a trial and were each jailed for 18 months.

Harold and Eileen Foulkes were both beaten during the melee, which also caused around £400 worth of damage to their car

Bolton Crown Court heard how the the incident took place in August 2013 after the wedding reception at the Railway Club in Farnworth and the Etchells - who married in 2012 - were invited as guests.

The court heard that Mr Foulkes would often help at the events and was assisting at the function with about 100 people present.

Trouble began at about midnight as the celebrations began to wind down and Mr Foulkes began to pop balloons during the clean-up as they had previously set the club alarm off.

Mrs Etchells castigated Mr Foulkes for waking up her daughter and further trouble occurred outside when the party were seen to behaving loudly.

As the club has a sign up outside asking customers to be quiet, Mrs Foulkes - who brought food to the club for her husband - politely asked the Etchells to keep the noise down.

But the drunken mother punched the elderly woman in the face while Mr Etchells set about the victim’s husband punching him in the head and face, causing his nose to bleed.

Fearing they wouldn't stop, Mr Foulkes got into the car and tried to drive off with his wife and the other members of staff inside.

However, punches continued to reign down on the man through the open window of his car and he felt trapped as he had his seatbelt on and could not move, rendering him helpless as he was repeatedly attacked.

One of the other women in the car got out, at which point Mrs Etchells got into the car and assaulted the pregnant woman, pulling her hair and scratching her chest despite pleas to leave her alone because she was pregnant. Eventually Mrs Etchells got out of the car and the police were then called.

A dent to the door of the car caused by Mrs Etchells’ tirade was estimated at £400, but the loss of Mr Foulkes’ hearing aid - and the replacement - was valued at £3,600.

Defending Sarah Etchells, Huw Edwards accepted she was drunk and behaved ‘appallingly’, but said she had three children under 17 and is the sole carer for her 82-year-old grandmother.

But sentencing the judge Mr Recorder Timothy Hamman said: 'This was a disgraceful act in which two elderly people were attacked without reason when performing an unpaid service of running a social club which had been used to host a wedding where you were all guests.

'It must have been terrifying for them and for the three bar staff waiting to be taken home.

'Sarah Etchells, you started it. For a married woman with a child who was present looking on your behaviour was as bizarre as it was disgusting. You should be ashamed. I watched you sat through your husband’s trial without showing any glimmer of emotion or embarrassment at your appalling behaviour.

'Nicholas Etchells you were drunk and agitated. Dale Hughes you were prepared to lend yourself and involve yourself in an angry confrontation.

Dale Hughes, who was also found guilty of one count of assault following a trial and was jailed for 18 months

'Sarah Etchells you attacked an elderly woman at night in a large group and played a leading role by starting it. You attacked an elderly victim and you each played a significant and leading role in what was a combined attack.'

After the hearing PC Joanne Boyle of Greater Manchester Police said: 'The facts of this appalling case speak for themselves and serve as a sad indictment of what can happen when loutish behaviour and alcohol are mixed, becoming a violent cocktail that results in innocent, hard-working people being harmed.

'This man is an upstanding member of the community who kindly gives up some of his free time to help out at the club. Both he and his wife show the sort of community spirit that is to be admired, so to therefore be the victims of such sustained violence is absolutely shameful.

'There was no provocation for what happened, no excuse or justification for attacking an elderly couple who were simply helping out at a function to such a brutal and appalling attack.

'To add to that, a pregnant woman was also harmed despite her pleas that she was with child. Thankfully the unborn baby was not injured but clearly the potential for serious harm was there, making this an even more cowardly and shameful act.

'If there is any positive message to come from this sad case, it should be in the form of a warning to people attending these sorts of functions were alcohol flows freely.

'I would hope in the cold light of day these people regret attacking two pensioners and a pregnant woman, and that if they go back they would not allow alcohol or anger to cloud their decision-making.'
