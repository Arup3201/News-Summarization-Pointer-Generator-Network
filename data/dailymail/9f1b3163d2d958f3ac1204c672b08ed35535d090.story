Phone hacking was ‘lazy journalism’ and unacceptable, Andy Coulson said yesterday as he denied any involvement in targeting murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s voicemail.

Coulson, 46, said he knew of ‘vague’ gossip about phone hacking when he was editor of the News of the World but did not realise it was illegal.

He rejected allegations that he was part of a plot to hack countless celebrities and politicians.

Unacceptable: Andy Coulson, pictured arriving at the Old Bailey on Tuesday with his wife Eloise, has described phone hacking as 'lazy journalism'

He told the Old Bailey: ‘I would have thought it was intrusive, I would have thought it was a breach of privacy and I also thought it was lazy journalism.’

Coulson, later Prime Minister David Cameron’s director of communications, said he knew about journalists’ ‘dark arts’, such as surveillance, but said he meant only on the ‘acceptable, legal side of the law’.

Coulson resigned as editor in 2007 as royal editor Clive Goodman and private detective Glenn Mulcaire were jailed for hacking the phones of Palace aides.

He told the Old Bailey he regretted not asking more questions about how journalists knew of ‘phone traffic’ – who was in phone contact with who.

‘I think that is one area where I could and should have done more to interrogate,’ he said.Coulson repeatedly denied he had sanctioned phone hacking.

Mulcaire admits hacking Milly Dowler’s voicemail in April 2002, on a week when then deputy editor Coulson was in charge.

Coulson said he did not know his journalist Neville Thurlbeck had told Surrey Police he could access her voicemails.

He denies conspiring to hack phones and to pay public officials for information.

The trial continues.
