When it comes to vegetables, Peter Glazebrook likes to think big.

So the man who has already grown the world’s heaviest onion and potato has now added this colossal cauliflower to his record-breaking collection.

At 60lb and a whopping 6ft wide, it would make enough cauliflower cheese to feed a family for weeks. Which is what Mr Glazebrook and his wife Mary had in mind yesterday as they hacked away at it so it could be frozen for meals.

Colossal: Peter Glazebrook, 69, shows off his world-record cauliflower, which ways 60lb

The
 cauliflower, which is the Darwin variety, has beaten the previous 
record by 6lb and is 20 times heavier than the ones we buy in the  
supermarkets.

After planting the vegetable last July, Mr Glazebrook, 
69, nurtured it in his greenhouse and fed it calcium nitrate, which aids
 cell growth and strengthens the plant.

He then switched to a high potash feed once the weather heated up in March.

Seven
 adjudicators visited his greenhouse in Newark, Nottinghamshire, for the
 all-important weigh in.

Vast: Mr Glazebrook, joined by fellow gardeners behind the giant vegetable, already owns four world records, including a title for the world's longest beetroot

Pride: Mr Glazebrook's wife Mary shows off her husband's acheivement. The record was broken on Easter Monday as seven adjudicators visited his greenhouse in Newark, East Midlands

He said: ‘The weighing was conducted at my home
 because there were no vegetable shows at this time of year. My previous
 effort last year was weakened by the long cold snap that hit most of 
the UK.

‘The exceptionally mild autumn this time has helped me to clinch this record-breaker.’

Mr
 Glazebrook weighed two cauliflowers on the day and the first fell 
short, weighing a still impressive 51.1lb.

He is a celebrity figure in 
giant vegetable circles for the world records he holds.He has grown
 the world’s longest beetroot and parsnip, measuring 21ft and 19ft, 5in 
respectively, as well as the world’s heaviest onion, weighing 18lb, and a
 potato at 11lb.

The previous world cauliflower record had stood 
since 1999 and was held by Alan Hattersley of Sheffield, who produced a 
54lb vegetable. Kevin Fortey, a giant vegetable growing expert, said Mr 
Glazebrook’s latest record is a remarkable achievement.

He said: ‘The
 vegetables take a lot of time and dedication from the growers and are 
costly to produce. There has not been a cauliflower grown this big since
 1999.

‘It would probably feed the entire royal family! Peter’s wife has been busy chopping up the cauliflower and freezing it.’
