A New York elementary school principal has come under fire from parents after banning her teachers from assigning their pupils any homework. 

According to local news site DNAinfo, Jane Hsu, who is the principal at P.S. 116 in Kips Bay, Manhattan, sent a letter home to the parents of all Pre-K through fifth grade students informing them that the school's teachers would no longer be assigning work for the children to do outside of school hours.

She suggested that her students' time would be better spent focusing on other, more enjoyable, activities such as playing video games, watching TV or spending time outside.

'The topic of homework has received a lot of attention lately, and the negative effects of homework have been well established,' Ms Hsu explained to parents in the letter.

'They include: children's frustration and exhaustion, lack of time for other activities and family time and, sadly for many, loss of interest in learning.'

Ms Hsu added that she was 'excited that we are redefining the landscape of homework', before going on to explain that she didn't believe she was 'eliminating' homework, but rather adjusting the expectations of both her parents and her pupils in terms of what that phrase means. 

But while her students are no doubt delighted at the news, their parents are less enthused by the school's decision.

'I was just thinking maybe I'll keep my daughter here for another year, but this pushed me over the edge,' Daniel Tasman, the father of a second grade pupil at the school, told DNAinfo. 

'This is their time to learn now, when they have good memory,' said Stanley, the parent of a third grade pupil at P.S. 116.

'I give him extra work, though. I go to Barnes and Nobles and give him my own homework.'

Ironically, the school's mission statement - which available on its website - states clearly that pupils are expected to 'achieve high academic standards' and to 'take responsibility for their own learning'. 

Homework-free zone: Parents of the school's students are angry at Ms Hsu's decision, with one father going as far as to say he would pull his daughter from her class

'Our school, P.S. 116, is a community of learners in which all children are encouraged to achieve high academic standards and social success, to enjoy learning, to celebrate diversity, to develop analytical skills, and to model exemplary behavior,' the website explains. 

'We empower our students to take responsibility for their own learning by recognizing that effort leads to academic success.

'They are active participants and every child has a responsibility not just to perform a task, but to do it to the best of her or his ability.' 

But despite the anger and frustration being voiced by many parents however, Ms Hsu is adamant that she has made the best decision possible for pupils and added that she is 'looking forward' to seeing what 'positive impact' the school's new homework options will have on both the students - and their parents. 

And according to Peter Pizzolongo, associate executive director at National Association for the Education of Young Children, Ms Hsu's theory is actually not as bizarre as some of the school parents might think. 

Speaking to Yahoo Parenting about P.S. 116's new homework policy, Mr Pizzolongo explained that, while children need 'the opportunity to apply what they have learned after they leave the school environment', that additional education time doesn't necessarily have to take the more traditional form of worksheets and book-based assignments. 

'When kids engage in rough and tumble play outdoors, "big body play" we call it, they're not only enhancing their physical development, they're learning how to set limits in a social-emotional context, problem solve, and make decisions,' he added. 

'These skills hit all the domains of learning.'
