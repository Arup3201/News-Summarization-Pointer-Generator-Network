Investigators have confirmed that a man who burned to death at a Los Angeles Halloween party accidentally set himself on fire while light a cigarette.

Video of the tragic event shows Gilbert Estrada engulfed in flames and flailing around helplessly as other party-goers continue to dance around him.

Estrada had gone to the West Hollywood Carnaval dressed as a sniper in camouflage. According to the Los Angeles Times, the costume was made from burlap sacks and straw.

Engulfed in flames: Gilbert Estrada is in the middle of a crowd engulfed in flames

'It's really thin and flammable,' Los Angeles County Sheriff's Detective Richard Biddle told the Los Angeles Times. 'That stuff could ignite pretty fast.'

Biddle told the Times that an bystander told investigators he saw Estrada accidentally ignite the hood of his Halloween costume while he was trying to light a cigarette. When he pulled the hood off his head, the flames spread to his back, eventually engulfing his whole body.

Derek Easley was at the festival and saw the event.

'So many people were drunk and partying,' he told the Los Angeles Times.

'People were chanting, clapping, filming and taking pictures like it was some kind of cool, funny thing and not realizing it was a guy who was suffering in a really bad condition.'

Party on: An onlooker throws her hands in the air and cheers before realising that Mr Estrada is not performing a stunt

The horrifying video shows what starts out as a fun night – great weather, huge stage, loud music and a massive crowd.

‘He’s on fire!’ a person screams.

The video quickly pans to the left to show flames shooting about 10 feet into the air.

Mr
 Estrada, who is shirtless by the end of the video, is rolling and 
violently flailing around Santa Monica Boulevard as the flames scorch 
his skin.

Partygoers don’t initially appear to be concerned, perhaps believing it to be part of the spectacle, and continue dancing.

One person throws his arms in the air and cheers.

But
 towards the end of the one minute 41 second-long video, several people 
are seen barreling through the crowd to help Mr Estrada.

After
 the fire is mostly stomped out, the badly ailing man attempts to crawl 
forward, but collapses as many of the 500,000 attendees mock him.

‘What the f**k are you doing?’ one person shouts.

Wearing no shirt, his jeans are covered in embers, Mr Estrada is in very obvious pain, but the mocking continues. People cheer after the video taker's friends ask if he got it on camera.

‘Yeah I got that s**t on camera!’

Mr Estrada’s devastated family has set up a page for people to donate for a funeral after his sudden death.

‘On October 31st, my brother Gilbert Estrada passed away from a tragic accident he sustained while celebrating halloween at West Hollywood's Halloween Carnaval,’ the page says.

‘His costume went up in flames for reasons unknown and he suffered severe burns to his upper torso including his face.’
