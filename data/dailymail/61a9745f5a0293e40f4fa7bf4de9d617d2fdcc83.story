A woman who was repeatedly raped by her father and gave birth to her own brother has hit out after her attacker was only jailed for a year.

Tiara Stevens said on Monday she had waited 14 years for justice only to see her father's sentence as a 'slap in the face.'

An outraged Tiara said: 'To wait 14 years and all a person gets is one year?

'A pat on the back, telling them it's okay to molest your daughter, impregnate her, and for her to have a child, a blind child? It's ok?'

Outraged: Ms Stevens says she is furious that her father must serve only one year in jail for repeatedly raping her when she was a little girl

Fred Montgomery, 47, had pleaded guilty to criminal sexual conduct with a minor.

He was sentenced on Monday to 15 years in jail, but all but one year was suspended.

Tiara was just 12 years old when she was impregnated by her father at the trailer home they shared.

She only realised she was pregnant the day before she gave birth after going into labour at school.

Her son was born blind and due to gene problems was born an albino.

Tiara told officials in 1999 that her father had raped her in the mobile home they shared in Lancaster County, South Carolina.

But no action was ever taken even though a DNA test in 2000 confirmed he was the father of his own grandson.

Tiara and her father continued to live in the same small town for over a decade until authorities were pushed into action by the single mother.

Officials with the 6th Circuit Solicitor's Office said a fire at the courthouse destroyed many of the documents related to the case.

In an interview with WISTV, 27 year old Tiara said she was shocked by the lenient sentence.

'It was a slap in the face,' she said.

Tiara said she is often confused on how to describe her son.

'That confuses me a lot,' said Stevens. 'It's like, "Which one are you today? Are you my son, or are you my brother?" Because he really is both.'

In a previous interview, Tiara described how her father would sneak into her room and rape her.

'He never told me what he was doing,' said Stevens. 'It was just late at night. He would come in, take my clothes off, and he would have sex. And he would leave and he would say, "You better not stay up all night," and I would go in the bathroom and I would cry. The next night he may not do it, but the next night, he would repeat the same thing.'

Tiara said she has not yet told her son that her grandfather is actually her father and will be out of prison in a year.

'From this day forward, I will fight for victim's rights to make sure this never happens again,' Stevens said.
