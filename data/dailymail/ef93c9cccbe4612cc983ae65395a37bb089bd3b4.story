Despite claims we’re obsessed with always having the latest and greatest gadgets, millions of us still hoard old and out-of-date devices.

Living room TVs are relegated to bedrooms, and phones are handed down to children, for example.

And although it may seem like you’re saving money by doing this, the amount of extra energy they use can end up costing more – financially and in terms of the environment.

Experts estimated energy use of individual products using the Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment database and studied consumer reports to estimate usage between 1992 and 2007 (pictured). The study concluded a household of 'legacy gadgets' uses energy equivalent to 30% of what a car burned during 2007

Researchers from Rochester Institute of Technology in New York estimated energy use of individual products using the Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment database.

This database determines the environmental emissions and energy consumption produced when making individual gadgets.

The experts then studied consumer reports to estimate ownership and usage between 1992 and 2007.

During this 15-year period, the number of household gadgets rose from four to 13.

This included desktop PCs, feature phones, laptops, and box-set TVs during 1992, digital cameras and digital camcorders in 1997.

The introduction of MP3 players, smartphones, DVD players, and LCD TVs in 2002, and plasma screens, tablets, and e-readers in 2007.

The time spent using these devices also rose from 700 hours in 1992 to 1,400 in 2007.

The time spent using these devices also increased from 700 hours in 1992 to 1,400 in 2007.

As next-generation models are released, they typically become more energy efficient.

By studying the additional energy created by using older devices in tandem with newer gadgets, the researchers concluded a household uses extra energy equivalent to 30 per cent of what a car burned during 2007.

‘Despite efficiency improvements in individual devices from 1992 to 2007, the net impact of the entire product community increased, due primarily to increasing ownership and usage,’ explained the study.

‘The net energy impact for the product community is significant, nearly 30 per cent of the average gasoline use in a US passenger vehicle in 2007.

During the 15 years studied, the number of household gadgets rose from four to 13 and the time spent using these devices also rose from 700 hours in 1992 to 1,400 in 2007.

‘The analysis points to a large contribution by legacy products - cathode ray tube televisions and desktop computers - due to historically high consumption rates.’

The data obtained only covered gadgets released until 2007.

The researchers then estimated the effect newer devices may have on energy use and found that if people switched from watching shows on TVs and PCs to viewing them on tablets and laptops, energy consumption would be reduced by almost half (44 per cent).
