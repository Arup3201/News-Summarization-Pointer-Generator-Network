Most people can't make a shot in basketball at the best of times.

Now David Kalb has truly put the world to shame - by shooting hoops from the driver's seat of his car.

The California trick shooter has notched up almost a million views on YouTube after he made the shot one-handed in a car park.

The unbelievable footage 
shows him dribbling two separate basketballs single-handedly and 
allowing them to bounce back through the sunroof of his accelerating 
car.

As he reaches the hoop, he shoots - and scores, shouting: 'There we go!'.

The footage was shot using two cameras mounted on the bonnet and boot of his car and is not the first trick shot by Mr Kalb.

He is known among fans for his unusual, creative trick shots which have included shooting hoops from the seat of a unicycle.

He once even beat NBA star LeBron James in a sponsored basketball contest.
