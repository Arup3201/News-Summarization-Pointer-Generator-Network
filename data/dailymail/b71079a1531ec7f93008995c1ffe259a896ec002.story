A vicar who complained about 'blasphemous' comments made by Jeremy Clarkson has been told by the BBC that 'offensive language is just a part of everyday life'.

The Rev Graeme Anderson said he was 'surprised and upset' after the Top Gear presenter shouted 'Jesus wept' and 'God Almighty' during a show on March 4.

The 52-year-old has vowed never to watch the motoring programme again after receiving an 'unsatisfactory' response from the broadcaster, which claimed 'there is no consensus about words that are acceptable'.

'Double standards': The BBC told Rev Anderson that Clarkson's words are 'a part of everyday language'

Mr Anderson, of St Mary's church, in Radcliffe-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, said: 'I thought Top Gear was great before this.

'But I found Jeremy Clarkson's comments very offensive and I think many Christians would.

'They belittled, trivialised and 
cheapened Jesus Christ and Christianity. I was really quite surprised as
 he is a BBC presenter and it is blasphemous.

'There are many normal, honest people who I think would have been offended.

Jeremy Clarkson has a long history of controversy.

In December he sparked fury for a series of Carry On style digs at India's clothing, trains, toilets, food and history.

And last year the BBC apologised about an item on BBC2's Top Gear which led
 to the Mexican ambassador complaining about the 'outrageous, vulgar and
 inexcusable insults' made about Mexicans by Clarkson and co-hosts James
 May and Richard Hammond.

The BBC’s editorial complaints unit upheld criticisms of the show and ruled that it reinforced stereotypes.

Clarkson was also roundly condemned 
earlier this year for comments he made about the energy saving mode on 
his new television which, he said, made every programme look 'like it's 
being presented by Lenny Henry in a cave.'

After those comments, war hero Johnson
Beharry, 31, from Grenada, said: 'Remarks like this just aren’t funny. 
They legitimise racism.'

In 
February 2009, Clarkson famously called then-prime minister Gordon Brown
a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot' and in November the previous year, the BBC 
received almost 2,000 complaints when he joked about lorry drivers 
murdering prostitutes.

'Sometimes the Church and Christians 
are belittled and cheapened, and sometimes we deserve it, to be honest. 
But this is different.

'I also drew attention to double 
standards between the way the BBC deals with Christianity and Islam. I'm
 delighted the BBC treats Islam with such respect.

'I just wish they would treat Christianity with some.'

Mr Anderson has also made a complaint 
to the watchdog Ofcom. In a statement – which the vicar said was the 
same response he received – a BBC spokesman said: 'There is no consensus
 about words that are acceptable, when, and by whom, as different words 
cause different offence to different people.

'Some of 
the words and phrases that can cause offence have, whether we like it or
 not, become part of everyday language and it would be unrealistic for 
broadcasters to suggest they are not widely used in a range of contexts.

'We do 
however respect the fundamental human right to exercise freedom of 
thought, conscience and religion, this includes an individual’s freedom 
to worship, teach, practice and observe.

'While we also have a duty to 
reflect society as it really is, we try to ensure our output is not used
 to denigrate the beliefs of others.'

However, Rev Anderson was unhappy with the response, branding it a 'non reply', and has vowed never to watch Top Gear again.

'It did not really engage with my concerns at all,' he added.

'So far, I have not heard Jeremy Clarkson apologise for anything and mean it. Part of me didn’t want to go very public with this because he might need this type of publicity for his career.

'I won’t be watching again. I can’t risk the offence.'

Rev Anderson has also complained to Ofcom, and is awaiting a response.

Clarkson’s comments were made in a episode of Top Gear that aired on March 4. He shouted 'Jesus wept' while driving a KTM X-bow open stop sports car in the rain from his home in London to the show’s studio at Dunsford Aerodrome in Waverley, Surrey, and blurted out ‘God Almighty’ as he was behind the wheel of a Bentley powered by a Spitfire engine.

It is not the first time Top Gear has offended Christians.

The 2010 Boxing Day edition of the show caused anger with a nativity scene that depicted the new Stig - the show’s mystery test driver - as the baby Jesus.
