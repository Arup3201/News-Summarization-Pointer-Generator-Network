There are some things in life, such as putting your finger into a live electrical socket, that you would never try again.

Playing James Milner at right back in an England shirt is another.

To think that a two-time winner of the Barclays Premier League is not considered good enough to play in his own position for the national team is a remarkable call.

Getting a chasing: Milner (right) labours as Jefferson Montero shows him a clean pair of heels

Headscratcher: James Milner (right), who struggled at right back, looks bemused after Ecuador's opener

Playing Milner at right back, just in case Glen Johnson is injured during the World Cup, is not a viable alternative. It was a mistake.

This was a training ground experiment that Roy Hodgson was determined to put to the test during one of England’s tune-up matches.

Every time an Ecuador player was in possession at the Sun Life Stadium, they looked up and hoped to send the ball left, to the feet of Jefferson Montero.

It was a deliberate strategy, designed to unsettle Milner after Hodgson's decision to deploy him in England’s second choice defence.

Just as Milner was adjusting to an unorthodox position, Ecuador went in front with a move that only really got going when his poor clearance fell to Montero in the eighth minute.

England’s defence was exposed, brutally as it turned out when Enner Valencia rose above Chris Smalling to power his header beyond Ben Foster.

You could see where Hodgson was going with this and it seemed like a solid idea when he talked it through.

Uncomfortable: England are unlikely to repeat the Milner experiment

That’s what these games are for and the fact that it didn't really work out is no biggie.

It would be lazy to blame Milner for this performance, particularly when he was thrust, unexpectedly, into an unorthodox role.

When the pressure was on in the final stages of the Premier League season, the City midfielder excelled in their engine room.

It takes time to learn a new position and it was fairly obvious, the quick feet of Montero out on Ecuador’s left, that England will need to look elsewhere.

He wasn’t helped by the first half indiscipline of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who was supposed to be offering some kind of protection to Milner down England’s right.

Going forward they were dependable, a real threat whenever they combed through Ecuador’s midfield. Still, it didn’t feel right.

Hodgson’s alternative at right back is Smalling, for whom he has a soft spot despite the defender's failure to get off the floor to challenge Valencia.

When you think of England’s first-choice central defensive partnership - Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka - there is a feeling of safety and security.

Neither of them are world beaters but they have huge experience in the Premier League. Smalling and Phil Jones just don’t offer that.

For some players it takes 10 or more caps before they feel comfortable playing for the national team. With these two you wonder whether it will ever happen at all.

Soft centre: Phil Jones (left) and Chris Smalling were unconvincing at the heart of England's defence

Jones, to be fair to him, was returning to the England team after recovering from a shoulder injury that has ruled him out of action since May 6.

At least Luke Shaw, making his first start for England, offered some entertainment going forward. Defensively he was sound, too.

He is unfazed by the England experience and Hodgson will have no hesitation putting him into the team should Leighton Baines blow up.

Beyond that, this defensive experiment burned out pretty swiftly.
