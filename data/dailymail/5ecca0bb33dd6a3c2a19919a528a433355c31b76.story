Swansea midfielder Jose Canas is due to hold talks with Elche ahead of a return to Spain.

Celta Vigo have also shown an interest in the 27-year-old, who made 35 appearances for the Swans last season after signing from Real Betis.

The Swans meanwhile remain on the trail of Almeria's Nigerian midfielder Ramon Azeez.

Interest: Swansea are looking at bringing in Nigerian international Ramon Azeez from Almeria

He has been capped three times by his country and has scored twice in the league for Almeria. 

Defender Chico Flores remains a target for Michael Laudrup at Lekhwiya, presenting the opportunity for the centre-back to be reunited with his former boss.

Wolfsburg have expressed an interest in Wilfried Bony who scored 25 goals in 48 appearances last season and has been linked with a move away from the Liberty Stadium. 

On the move? Swansea defender Chico Flores is attracting interest from Lekhwiya

Reunited? If Flores was to move to Lekhwiya, he would play under former manager Michael Laudrup once more

Scorer: Wilfried Bony, who netted 25 times for the Swans in 48 games last season, is interesting Wolfsburg
