Ex-Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock, who retired in 2007, got back in the water for a charity swim today.

The Princess of Monaco, 35, was seen swimming with children in Saint Geours de Maremne in southwestern France.

The Mon√©gasque princess wore her blonde highlighted hair scraped back as she paddled through the pool and taught the group of enthusiastic children how to swim during the Live to Swim day.

Charlene proved the best
possible coach a the event organised by the club Inshore Rescue Capbreton. Its aim was to raise awareness of water safety and saw 150 children participate.

Her own charity, The Princess Charlene Foundation, aims to
help women and children on five of the world's seven continents. One of the focus points is also reinforcing the awareness of water safety.

'Some of 
my present and future projects for my foundation are underlining the 
importance and reinforcing the awareness of water safety,' writes Charlene on her foundation's website.

'We are all aware of horrible stories about small children drowning because they could not swim.

'Teaching them how to swim could save
their lives, and the importance and awareness will help them to feel 
more comfortable and confident in all aquatic areas as well.'

She represented South Africa at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, with her team finishing fifth in the Women's 4x100 m Medley. She retired from competitive swimming in 2007.

Her commitment to the sport, though, seems unwavering.

Teaching children to swim could save their lives, and the importance and awareness will help their confidence

Ensuring her home-town of Durban, 
South Africa, 
becomes the premier city for swimming in the country, the princess is 
reportedly set to donate a 'large amount' to the its swimming 
future.

This could make it the top sport in the city, ahead even of 
rugby and football.

Last month Charlene's husband Prince Albert, 55, showed off his sporting abilities as he played volleyball on a beach.

The princess finally put rumours to bed over the 'turbulent' start to her marriage last month in a rare interview.

She said the tears streaming down her cheeks at her wedding 
to Albert in 2011 were not the result of a series of rows 
over his womanising ways, but in fact tears of happiness.

She
described this speculation, as well as rumours she attempted to escape 
in the days leading up to her wedding, as 'categorical lies'.
