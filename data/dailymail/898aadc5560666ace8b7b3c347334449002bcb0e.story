George Osborne infuriated Liberal Democrat colleagues and environmental groups yesterday by refusing to sign up to carbon emissions targets and insisting on a new ‘dash for gas’.

The Chancellor is understood to be determined not to commit Britain to tough climate targets beyond 2020, arguing they will be a disadvantage for businesses.

The Energy Department resisted calls for deep cuts to onshore wind subsidies, announcing yesterday a reduction of 10 per cent in payments for new turbines.

Power: Government subsidies for wind turbines are to be cut by 10 per cent as George Osborne refuses to sign up for new carbon emissions targets

But green groups reacted angrily as 
the Government’s energy strategy endorsed support for future gas power 
in a compromise between the Lib Dem-led department and Mr Osborne.

Significantly, sources said the Chancellor and Prime Minister were determined to block ‘decarbonisation’ targets after 2020.

One Whitehall source said: ‘The 
official line is the Government is reserving its position, but George 
Osborne and David Cameron have made clear they object to post-2020 
targets, which suggests the Government will never agree to any.’

Ministers
also announced yesterday that Government subsidies for wind turbines 
are to be cut by ten per cent and planning rules that regulate their 
construction reviewed.

The Chancellor had been pushing for even steeper cuts - but agreed to accept Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey’s proposal for an initial ten per cent reduction, followed by a further review next year.

Resolute: Mr Osborne is understood to be determined not to commit Britain to tough new climate targets beyond 2020

In exchange, the Lib Dems have agreed
that gas-fired power stations will be a key part of Britain’s energy 
production well into the 2030s, despite the objections of climate change
campaigners.

The 
Government will commit to introducing a ‘simple and stable regulatory 
regime’ to allow domestic shale gas development, using the controversial
process of ‘fracking’.

Gas
deposits trapped underground are extracted by fracturing shale rock 
with blasts of water, sand and chemicals -  a process that has been 
accused of causing small earthquakes near sites.

But it is the Chancellor’s determination to block new climate targets beyond 2020 that will cause most controversy.

A report from MPs today insists Britain and the rest of Europe should sign up to even stricter emissions targets to boost green energy.

They recommend the EU cuts carbon emissions by 30 per cent by 2020 - instead of the current 20 per cent which they claim is ‘not ambitious or challenging’.

The Energy and Climate Change Committee says that despite opposition from the US and China to legally-binding caps on emissions, Europe should ‘show leadership’ on climate change.

The MPs’ report claims increasing carbon targets would put pressure on the world’s biggest emitters to make similar commitments.

At a UN climate conference in South Africa last December, world leaders agreed a ‘road map’ for all major countries - including developing countries - to introduce targets to tackle global warming for the first time.

However the US, China and India - which make up around half of global emissions - will only have to start cutting them from 2020 and it is unclear how stringent or binding the targets will be.

Tim Yeo, the Conservative MP who chairs the Energy and Climate Change Committee said: ‘Europe can be proud of the leadership it has shown on climate change. It must now show that leadership again by setting a more ambitious goal to bolster the chances of a new agreement being reached in 2015.

‘That needs to be the year an agreement is reached to give the world a fighting chance of keeping temperatures below dangerous levels.

'The EU’s current 20 per cent carbon reduction target by 2020 is no longer sufficiently ambitious or challenging and will easily be reached because of the recession.’

Supply and demand: Ministers have agreed that gas-fired power stations will be a key part of Britain's energy production well into the 2030s

The committee suggests Britain should
commit to around 42 per cent cuts in emissions on 1990 levels, through a
new generation of wind turbines, solar panels and nuclear power.

But
manufacturers’ groups warned that high energy costs due to climate 
policies were already putting thousands of industrial jobs at risk.

The
Energy Intensive Users Group, representing around 800,000 people in 
industries such as steel, cement and chemicals, is calling for tax 
relief on energy costs for its members to avoid job losses.

Its
chairman Steve Elliott said: ‘We all want to see a greener societ, but 
we can’t do this with one hand tied behind our backs.’

John Sauven, executive director of 
Greenpeace, said: ‘The Coalition has sunk to pretty low depths now it 
has turned real UK opportunities for green growth and jobs into an 
unedifying inter-department squabble.’
