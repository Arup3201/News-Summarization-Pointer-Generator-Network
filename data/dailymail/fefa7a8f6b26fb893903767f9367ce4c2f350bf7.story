A mother is suing a dentist for £10,000 compensation after claiming that their bungled treatment left her so ugly her baby cries every time she sees her.

Xu Feng, 33, says she was talked into paying £1,200 to have 12 crowns fitted on her teeth during a visit to the clinic in Chongqing city, central China.

But she claimed her gums became covered in infections and abscesses after the treatment.

Damage limitation: Surgeons from another clinic removed the crowns (pictured) and treated the infections she developed after she suffered more pain than she 'could have imagined'

Surgeons discovered that the unlicensed clinic had ground down perfectly healthy teeth to stumps, exposing raw nerves under the crowns and veneers.

They have now removed the bad crowns and treated her infections.

Xu said: 'Once the anaesthetic wore off, I was in more pain than I could ever have imagined.

'Real dentists have cured the infections and the pain, but I look like a monster.

I have a one-year-old daughter who won't come near me if I open my mouth and screams and cries until I close it. Those people stole my smile.'

Now her husband Zhang Lu's lawyers are negotiating with the bogus clinic's owners over compensation.
