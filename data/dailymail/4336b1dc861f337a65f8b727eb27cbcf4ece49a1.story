Close call: Richard Cohen, seen right with wife Meredith Vieira in 2012, was rushed to the hospital this weekend to treat a blood clot

Meredith Vieira's husband Richard Cohen had a health scare this weekend that left them both waiting in the emergency room for news on his life-and-death condition.

Cohen's long battle with multiple sclerosis has been well documented but the sudden hospital trip this weekend was the result of a blood clot that traveled from his leg up dangerously close to his heart.

'It was sudden and serious. Very serious,' the former news producer turned author wrote on his blog, Journey Man.

'A badly swollen foot and a series of tests at a local hospital revealed a sizable blood clot in a leg. A CT scan indicated a piece of the clot had broken off and reached my lungs, perched on a blood vessel close to my heart.'

Cohen is currently undergoing stem cell treatment that is connected to his chronic illness but he was quick to point out that the blood clot was not connected to that treatment.

'It probably was caused by too many hours sitting in one position at the computer. The trial goes on and my determination to get over this goes on with it,' Cohen wrote.

Doctors used blood thinners and inserted an 'umbrella' tool that helped to catch future clots.

'The crisis seemed to end, and a new phase had begun.  Thereâ€™s a lot to figure out for the future,' he wrote.

The 66-year-old journalist has battled MS for more than four decades and had two bouts of colon cancer.

He worked for CNN, CBS, and ABC as a senior producer earlier in his career and he has continued writing. He has written three books and occasionally writes articles for The New York Times' health and fitness section as well as keeping an active blog that details his medical treatment.

Warning signs: Late last week, Cohen started noting that he did not feel well

Support: Vieira, who used to be one of the Today Show anchors and the host of Who Wants to be a Millionaire, is returning to TV in the fall with the launch of her own afternoon talk show

Happy ending: Vieira updated her followers but remained positive

Vieira, his wife of 27-years, first told her Twitter followers about his latest health scare on Monday, thanking the doctors at St John's Riverside Hospital and Mount Sinai for their help.

'Thank you for all your kind thoughts and prayers. Richard is feeling better and already flirting with the nurses!' she wrote on Tuesday.

Vieira has been an active part of Cohen's medical treatment for years, and when she quit the Today Show in 2011, citing the need to spend more time with her husband as one of her reasons for leaving the morning talk show.

She is now back to work and will be launching her own talk show, The Meredith Vieira Show, this September.
