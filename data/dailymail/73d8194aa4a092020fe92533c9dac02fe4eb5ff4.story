The diplomatic row between Britain and Spain over Gibraltar continued today after Spanish police entered British waters once again, just days after firing shots at a British jet-skier.

The Foreign Office yesterday protested to the Spanish government after a boat from Spain’s Guardia Civil entered
Gibraltan waters and took potshots at 32-year-old Dale Villa as he rode
his jet-ski close to a popular beach.

Just three days later, a police boat was seen in British waters again, in what locals described as a rebuke to the Foreign Office protest.

Gibraltan news website Vox posted a photograph of the boat, which apparently set out from its base in the port of Algeciras and made two incursions into the waters around Gibraltar.

Additionally, a second video of the 
shooting incident emerged today, with a number of shots apparently heard
ringing out across the water.

Foreign Office minister David 
Lidington condemned Mr Villa's shooting as ‘completely unacceptable’ and called
on Spain to take action against those responsible.

He said he had confronted his Spanish counterpart Inigo Mendez de Vigo yesterday to protest ‘in the strongest possible terms’.

Mr
Lidington added: ‘I made it clear that the discharge of a weapon in or 
near Gibraltar is completely unacceptable. I urged Mr Mendez de Vigo to 
investigate urgently and to take action to ensure this will not happen 
again.’

Gibraltar's chief minister Fabian 
Picardo today vowed to drag David Cameron into the diplomatic 
confrontation, saying the incident was 'so serious' that he had to 
ignore normal procedure.

'This incident, given what has now 
been established, is so serious that it is right that I should refer it 
directly to the Prime Minister,' he said.

'I will be doing so, accompanying what I send him with the relevant data for his information.'

Spain's foreign ministry denied that 
any shots were fired, and accused the British Government of granting too
much crebility to a 'rumour'.

A
spokesman said: 'Spain will be communicating to Britain its unease at 
the fact it has accepted an unconfirmed and false rumour which affects 
the relationship between two partners and allies.'

Father-of-three Mr 
Villa described how he had been fired at on two separate occasions as he
tested his new jet-ski with family and friends on Sunday afternoon.

‘I was very shaken and furious,’ said the delivery driver.

‘When
a huge boat is hurling after you and you hear gunshots it is very 
scary. There were three policemen on the boat and I actually saw one of 
them with a gun in his hand.

The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a major source of tension between the UK and Spain.

Both in 1967 and 2002, the people of Gibraltar rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty.

Yet, despite this, Spain still asserts a claim to the territory.

The tension began in 1704 when an Anglo-Dutch force captured Gibraltor from Spain during the war of the Spanish succession.

The territory was then ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.

Historically, it has proved to be an important base for the Royal Navy.

Now, its economy is based on tourism, financial services and shipping.

Under the 2006 constitution of Gibraltar, the territory governs its own 
affairs although defence and foreign relations are still the 
responsibility of the UK Government.

Located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, it is an area of 6.8 square kilometres.

‘I was just about to drop my friend 
off at West Beach when I heard the first shot. I don’t really think we 
took it seriously or believed it could be a gun, but clearly it was.

‘I
jumped back on again and whizzed off before realising the boat was 
chasing after me and had soon fired three more shots at me.

‘I
had only just taken my friend’s ten-year-old daughter out for a spin 
and was about to pick up her grandmother so we were not being 
threatening or doing anything wrong.

‘Maybe
these guys were bored – it being a Sunday – but I really hope something
is going to be done about it, as it is outrageous.’ Shots can be heard 
on a grainy video filmed by a witness. British sources said it was 
thought the Spanish police fired rubber bullets at the man.

Witness
Simy Herbert described the Guardia Civil as ‘trigger-happy’, adding: 
‘The Foreign Office has to do something now because when someone is shot
in our waters then everybody will start flapping.’

The UK’s charge d’affaires in Madrid was also despatched to make direct representations to ministers in the Spanish capital.

The
incident is believed to have been witnessed by an off-duty officer from
the Royal Gibraltar Police, which has launched a formal investigation. 
But a spokesman for Spain’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said ‘no 
incident’ had taken place’ and ‘no shot fired’.

 Britain was given Gibraltar in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, but Spain has said it will never renounce its claim to sovereignty.

British
sources said Gibraltar suffered frequent illegal incursions into its 
waters by Spanish boats, including police and naval vessels. From 
December last year to April, officials recorded 176 illegal incursions 
by Spanish boats.

Shooting: This map shows how the incident unfolded

Last 
November, Madrid was accused of an unlawful incursion into Britain’s 
territorial waters after a Spanish warship called Vencedora, a 288ft 
corvette, came within three miles of Gibraltar’s coast.

The ship ignored radio warnings to leave the area and HMS Scimitar, a seven-man patrol boat, was scrambled to intercept.

Mr Picardo described the incident as a ‘scandalous 
act of aggression which is illegal, imprudent, unprofessional and 
irresponsible’.

In a joint 
statement, Tory MEPs Giles Chichester, Ashley Fox and Julie Girling – 
who represent Gibraltar in the European Parliament – said Spanish 
provocation was ‘a form of international political posturing by a 
struggling government which hopes to distract attention from its 
domestic failures’.

They 
added: ‘For a shot to be fired will push to a new level the offence 
caused to the people of Gibraltar.

'This action is wholly illegal and as 
provocative as it is reckless.’

Action: Following the shooting, a Royal Navy Rib similar to this intercepted the Rio Cedena and told it to leave the waters

Incident: The Rio Cedena boat which the shots were fired from is similar to this Guardia Civil boat
