In a matter of weeks, James R. Van de Velde turned from prestigious Yale University lecturer to scorned murder suspect in the high-profile slaying of one his students. Now almost 15 years and several odd jobs later, Van de Velde has found his way back to the front of a classroom with a cleared name. 

Van de Velde, 53, was never charged in the murder of Suzanne Jovin, a 21-year-old political science major.

But the slaying was so violent - she was stabbed 17 times in the neck and back and left to die on a curb - that Van de Velde was made a national pariah after he was named a suspect in the crime, in spite of the fact that police found no hard evidence tying him to the scene.

Van de Velde says he was pushed out of Yale as a result and found it difficult to find a job anywhere else. 

'I felt I was in some ways at the very top of a very successful career and I was dropped through a trap door to the very bottom,' he told the New York Times in an interview published Wednesday.

Victim: Suzanne Jovin, a political science major at Yale, was murdered near her home at 21 years old

Fifteen years later, Van de Velde has won his first victory in the legal battle to clear his name. 

Yale University and and the City of New Haven announced on Monday that they had reached a settlement in his lawsuit against them, in which he claimed that being named a suspect violated his civil rights and damaged his reputation, career and health.

He brought the lawsuit against the city in 2001 and added Yale as a defendant in 2003.

The amount that Yale will pay as part of the settlement has not been disclosed. New Haven's portion comes to $200,000.

Van de Velde was 21-year-old Jovin’s thesis adviser at the time she was killed. He told the police that he had been home alone when she was stabbed and left on a curb to die.

'I wasn’t a boyfriend, ex-husband, a work colleague. I had no argument with her,' Van de Velde said in a 2009 interview with The Associated Press. 'My DNA was not at the scene. I was not seen at the scene.'

Following Jovin's murder, Van de Velde sought employment in the Defense Department, based on his previous employment in the naval intelligence reserves, as well as the State Department.

He was eventually able to get a position as a senior intelligence analyst at the Department of Defense, the Times reports. Later on, after taking the foreign service exam in 2004, he joined the State Department and began working for consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton as counterterrorism analyst.

As he rebuilt his career, Van de Velde met his wife and they had two kids, who are now eight and three years old.

He also picked up a job teaching a graduate course on intelligence and counterterrorism at Johns Hopkins University.

'I’d like to think I was able to rebuild my career through perseverance,' he told the Times. But, he lamented, 'I find myself now where I was when I was at 39' and still a lecturer at Yale, before Jovin's murder.
