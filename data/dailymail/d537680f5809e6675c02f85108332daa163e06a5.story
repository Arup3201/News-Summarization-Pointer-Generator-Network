Tim Sherwood has revealed Charles N'Zogbia's renewed impact at Aston Villa is down to extra training sessions carried out by the Frenchman.

The Villa manager admitted he was told when arriving at the club that N'Zogbia might let him down.

But Sherwood has handed the £9.5million winger two starts in a row, his first back-to-back since early December, and expects he can play a big part in the climax to Villa's season.

Tim Sherwood revealed that N'Zogbia's improved form has been down to extra training sessions 

N'Zogbia consistently troubled West Bromwich Albion's defenders with his direct running and pace in the second half of Villa's FA Cup win and set up Fabian Delph's opening goal.

'I said to him after the Newcastle game I have a long memory and I know how good he was at Wigan, what he possesses, and how scared managers are when he is flying,' said Sherwood.

'He can be anything he wants to be – I really mean that. I told him he needs to be a little bit fitter and needs to do a little bit extra than the other players and he said, 'No problem'.

'I am seeing him go and get clean kit after training and do his little bit extra and he gets rewarded for that. He is a grafter, he is similar to Emmanuel Adebayor.

'People want to rubbish them but I have never had a problem with Adebayor or Charles N'Zogbia. I don't know who has been rubbishing him but I've heard he might let you down.

'I take him on face value and he ain't let me down yet. I have told him and told him straight he is one of the best players in the team who can effect a football match.'
