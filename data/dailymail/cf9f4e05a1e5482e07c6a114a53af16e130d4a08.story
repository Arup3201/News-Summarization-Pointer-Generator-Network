The home where Jackie Kennedy Onassis lived until she was seven years old has hit the market - for an eye-watering $44million.

Located at the posh New York address 740 Park Avenue, the four-bedroom, six-bathroom apartment features a paneled library, a 'sweeping staircase', two offices and four fireplaces, all spread over two floors of the legendary building.

Pictures of the interior posted on Zillow show just how grandiose the home is, retaining much of its Art Deco charm despite recent renovations.

Luxurious: The sprawling apartment is in a building constructed by Jackie's grandfather James T Lee in 1929. It features four bedrooms, six bathrooms, formal living and dining rooms and a paneled library

The former
 First Lady, whose grandfather James T Lee constructed the building in 
1929, was known as Jacqueline Bouvier when she lived there in the 
Thirties.

One of the most legendary and recognizable buildings in the city, 740 Park - which was designed by famed architect Rosario Candela - has had a host of famous residents including designer Vera Wang, Woody Johnson and John D Rockefeller, Jr.

The Bouviers' former apartment, located on the sixth and seventh floors, is fitted with a chef's kitchen, a staff wing, a formal dining room and a living room with a bronze bar.

In the master suite - where her parents John Vernou Bouvier III, a Wall Street stockbroker, and Janet Norton Lee would have slept - are not one but two marble bathrooms, as well as two dressing rooms.

Living in the sprawling apartment, which overlooks Park Avenue in is just steps from Central Park, will also cost you a hefty monthly maintenance fee of $13,278.

Pricy property: The duplex apartment currently houses the art collection of former hedge funder David Garek and his wife Danielle, who bought the home in 2005 for $19.1million

As children, Jackie and her younger sister Caroline Lee divided their time between New York City and East Hampton, where the Bouvier family estate, Lasata, was located.

At the time she lived at 740 Park Avenue, Jackie was attending the exclusive Chapin School in the Upper East Side.

According to Business Insider, applicants trying to live in the famous 31-residence building these days must prove that they have liquid net worth of $100million.

But not every famous face is granted access; the website reports that Barbra Streisand, Neil Sedaka and Ukrainian-born American billionaire Leo Blavatnik have all been turned away by the co-op board.

A modern classic: The interior of the home is in pristine condition

The building is steeped in so much legend, in fact, that author Michael Gross wrote an entire book about it titled 740 Park: The Story of the Word's Richest Apartment Building.

Former hedge funder David Garek and his wife Danielle are currently selling the Bouviers' former home following an insider trading scandal at Mr Garek's firm, according to the New York Post.

The couple purchased it for $19.1million in 2005 and have since used it mostly as a place to showcase their extensive art collection.
