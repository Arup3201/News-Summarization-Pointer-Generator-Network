Passengers on board a Ryanair flight to Tenerife were encouraged to play a 'rowdy toilet roll throwing game' to win free booze, according to a holidaymaker.

Cabin crew allegedly split rows of people into two teams and told to hurl the rolls as far as they could in order to claim alcohol - hitting other passengers in the face in the process.

The 20-minute game took place on board a flight from Manchester to Tenerife, on which elderly holidaymakers were travelling.

On board games: Ryanair passengers were allegedly encouraged by to play a rowdy toilet roll tossing game on a flight to Tenerife

Complaint: A passenger on board the budget airline flight has said he will make a complaint

Music promoter and DJ Chris Prudence, 29, from Wirral, said he will be making a complaint to the budget airline after claiming 'all hell broke loose' on board the four-hour, 25-minute flight on Easter Sunday.

Rows of passengers were divided into two teams by a male member of the cabin crew and played six or seven rounds in a desperate bid to win a 'free bar'.

Mr Prudence said: 'I was sitting in my seat minding my own business when this blaring voice said whichever team managed to get a toilet roll to the back of a plane first won.

Free booze game: Passengers were promised alcohol if they won the game on board a Ryanair flight to Manchester

'The prize was a free bar which meant free alcoholic drinks to a flight full of lads and holidaymakers.

'But there were elderly people on board who just wanted quiet.

'There were all these hands in the air flailing wildly as this bundle, which was quite heavy, made its way to down the aisles to the back of the plane.

'I wasn't playing the game and the toilet roll hit me and a poor pensioner who was nodding off when the roll bashed into her face.'

After the game finished, cabin crew admitted that there was no free alcohol on board flight 4332.

On board brawl: Last month, a hen party was involved in a fight on board a Ryanair flight to Barcelona

Mr Prudence added: 'The clown who worked for Ryanair said he was just joking after all that nonsense. I was furious.'

He is planning to complain to Ryanair because of their 'unprofessionalism and disregard for the well-being of its passengers'.

It comes after last month, bride-to-be Kelly Lloyd, 30 was involved in a mid-air hen party brawl with her bridesmaid Katrina Hanafin, 33 during a flight from Manchester to Barcelona.

And in February, disturbing footage of furious passengers kept on a grounded Ryanair flight for 11 hours emerged on YouTube.

Police were eventually called because cabin crew would not allow the exasperated passengers to leave the plane. The airline later apologised for the fiasco.

A spokesman for Ryanair denied the claims.

'This 'free bar' story is totally untrue,' they said.

'There was no offer of a "free bar" on this or any other Ryanair flight and no free drinks were dispensed.

'Cabin crew were interacting with our customers and arranged a pass the parcel competition, but this was in a spirit of good fun (which Ryanair crews are encouraged to do).

'The vast majority of our customers on this flight enjoyed this light-hearted fun and complimented the crew who were professional and attentive to our customers at all times during this four-hour 25-minute flight.

'While we are both surprised and regret that Mr Prudence, a 29-year-old DJ, may not have enjoyed this brief bit of fun, his claims of a "free bar", a "quite heavy bundle" and "unprofessionalism" are simply untrue.'
