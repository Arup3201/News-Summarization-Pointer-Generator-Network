Barcelona forward Neymar could face an indefinite spell on the sidelines after suffering a grade one sprain to his left ankle during a training session.

It will come as a big blow to new boss Luis Enrique ahead of Sunday's La Liga opener against Elche.

The 22-year-old only returned to full training two weeks ago after recovering from a back injury picked up while playing for Brazil at the World Cup.

But this latest setback will come as another blow to the highly-rated youngster.

Neymar has endured his fair share of injury problems for Barcelona since joining the club last summer, making just 25 appearances in total last term but still scoring a respectable nine goals in the process. 

In an official statement on Barcelona's website they confirmed the news saying: 'Following Thursday's training session Neymar Jr. complained about some pain in his left ankle and tests have confirmed that the player has a grade 1 ankle sprain.

'The club's medical team has indicated that his return to training will depend on how the injury treatment evolves.

'It's worth recalling that, last Monday, Neymar Jr. received his medical discharge from the back injury that he suffered during the World Cup in Brazil.'
