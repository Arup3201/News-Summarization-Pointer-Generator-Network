Residents of a California community are furious after a violent sexual predator was released from a California mental hospital only to have his rent, around-the-clock security detail and even his food paid for by the state.

Christopher Hubbart, 63, and known as the ‘Pillowcase Rapist,’ was released into the town of Lake Los Angeles following decades behind bars after admitting to the rapes and attempted rapes of more than 100 women, officials said.

Death threats and protests began hours before he arrived in the desert community, and even his security guards are fearing for their life, KNBC reported.

Hubbart was called the ‘Pillowcase Rapist’ because he used pillowcases to muffle the screams of his victims, and locals protested his arrival by hanging them on a fence ringing his property.

Plans to release Hubbart have long been met with opposition, and it took authorities months to find a landlord willing to rent him a home.

The state convinced another ex-con, who spent eight years in prison for hiring a hit man to kill his wife, to rent the home for about $2,800 a month, KTLA reported.

Similar homes in the area are listed on Craigslist for less than half what the state is paying.

‘We don’t want you here,’ several people shouted as his two car security detail rolled down the dusty road towards the 800-square-foot, two-bedroom ranch set back from the road and wrapped in a wire fence.

‘Be afraid! Be very afraid! Because we won't let you scare us! We want you out! Get out!’

The ranch-style home has no television and has been referred to by his security details as ‘spartan,’ KABC reported.

‘I will stay until he wants to leave. I will stay here until he asks the judge that he wants to leave,’ resident Norma Valenti told KNBC. ‘We don't want him here.

‘We don't want him in this community. We don't want him wandering around our town, our children, our mothers, our grandmothers, our wives. We don't want him around.’

A spokesperson with Sunset Protective Services, the firm hired to protect Hubbart, told reporters gathered outside the house that the convicted rapist is ‘optimistic and hopes he can reintegrate back into society and live a normal life.’

Those security guards began Hubbart’s reintegration by shoving around a freelance cameraman trying to snap photos of the sex offender as he arrived at his new home.

‘I’m very angry,’ Valenti seethed to KTLA. ‘Everybody’s afraid. They’re literally scared and fearing for their lives because this man is here.’

Sources told KNBC they may face misdemeanour assault charges for the dustup. The guards will be by Hubbart’s side 24 hours a day and seven days a week. They will even do his food shopping, according to reports.

Despite them, and a GPS ankle bracelet, residents are still worried.

‘I know for me it's a litte personal, being a rape victim myself, mother of four Misty Vivirito told KABC.

‘My kids, I'm gonna put them in independent study,’ she continued. ‘I'm not going to send them to school or a bus stop, have them sitting there waiting for the bus and him come and try anything.’

Local officials also vented their outrage at the serial rapist’s release into their community.

Words cannot express my frustration at Christopher Evans Hubbart’s release to Lake Los Angeles. In the last year I’ve heard a great deal about Mr. Hubbart’s Constitutional rights,’ state assemblyman Steve Fox said in a statement.

‘This fight is not over. Serial rapists and pedophiles belong in prison, not next door.’

Hubbart was originally released from prison in 1979 only the continue raping women until he was tossed behind bars for 16 years.

He then raped more women and was thrown back in jail in 1996.

‘Once again, the State's criminal justice system failed to uphold its responsibility to protect the public's safety,’ L.A. County Supervisor Michael Antonovich said in a statement.

‘The Santa Clara County Judge's decision to dump a convicted serial rapist in our community is dangerous and reckless.’
