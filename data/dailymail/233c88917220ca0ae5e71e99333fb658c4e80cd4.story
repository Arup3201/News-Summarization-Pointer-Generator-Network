Zoe Edwards, 38, chased a gang of youths in her 4x4 and shot them with a BB gun after they egged her conservatory in Worsley, Manchester

An angry mother-of-two chased down a gang of youths in her 4x4 while wearing pyjamas and shot them with a BB gun after they egged her conservatory.

Zoe Edwards, 38, exploded into a rage after the teenagers attacked the back of her four-bedroom home in Worsley in Manchester, last Halloween.

Wearing just her pyjamas, she got into her silver 4x4 and sped over a mile to confront the gang of between 10 and 15 boys, a court heard.

Three of the teenagers said she sped towards them as they stood on Vicars Hall Lane in Boothstown, before winding down her window to shout and swear.

Manchester Magistrates Court was told she fired some sort of BB gun, which hit one victim on the back and another on his rucksack.

A post was later sent from her Facebook account to one of the boys saying: 'You can tell those spineless t***s you hang around with they are pathetic. Revenge is a b***h called Zoe.'

Edwards, who is understood to work in management at a construction firm, denied being abusive or having any kind of weapon with her but admitted leaving her home to find out who had thrown eggs.

She also denied sending the message and claimed instead that it was her son. 

On the allegations she said: 'I didn't do anything like that. I was scared as I realised I was on my own in my car and had come across these teenagers.' 

She was in tears in the witness box, as she added that her house, thought to be worth £305,000, had been targeted in egg attacks before and after the incident.

The boys admitted they did not tell their parents about the attack until two or three days after the incident with one of them even apologising for the egg throwing to Edwards' husband Chris.

Lee Bonner, defending, said this showed they had made up the story to pass on the blame for the 'nasty' egg attack. 

However, District Judge Mark Hadfield, rejected this account and found her guilty on two charges of assault and one of threatening behaviour.

The gang of between 10 and 15 boys targeted the £305,000 four-bedroom house on Halloween last year

He said: 'I can understand you were angry and upset at having your house egged. 

'I do find that you began pursuing them and that you discharged some form of implement which made contact with the back of the two complainants.'

The case was adjourned for a pre-sentence report.

Speaking afterwards, solicitor Gareth Williams said his client was 'surprised' at the verdict.

She jumped in her car and sped over a mile to Vicars Hall Lane where the boys claim she used a BB gun
