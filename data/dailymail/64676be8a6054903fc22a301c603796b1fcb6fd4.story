Former Washington D.C. Mayor Marion Barry is on the wrong side of the law again

Former Washington D.C. Mayor Marion Barry's Jaguar has been towed and impounded over more than $2,800 in unpaid traffic fines following a car accident on Saturday.

The current D.C. Councilman drove the car into traffic on Saturday night. He was released from the hospital on Sunday after suffering what the diabetic said was a 'hypoglycemic attack' that caused him to become disoriented and drive into an oncoming traffic lane in D.C.

Mr Barry, 78, owes $2,824 for 21 outstanding tickets that date back to February 2012, according to The Washington Times. 

The traffic tickets aren't the first time he's been caught on the wrong side of the law. In 1990, Mr Barry was videotaped smoking crack cocaine and was subsequently arrested by FBI officials on drug charges.

Footage of the crash on Saturday obtained by Fox DC shows the fender-bender. 

Following the accident, he was cited by 
police for driving on the wrong side of the road, expired tags and for 
not having insurance.

According
 to the Washington Times, Mr Barry accrued eight of the fines - totaling
 $1,460 - for failing to show current tags -- the tags were out of date 
because they belonged to an old BMW he had once driven.

Towing for owing: D.C. Councilman Marion Barry will have to pay more than $2,800 in unpaid traffic fines -- dating to 2012 -- to get the Jaguar back

Getting the boot: Marion Barry's car has been through a lot over the past few years. It's twice been booted, including pictured here in 2011

He
 also given five speeding tickets after he was picked up by cameras for 
driving 11-15 miles per hour over the speed limit in the past two years.
 Those tickets will cost him $684.

The former Mayor also reportedly ran a red light, which will cost him another $150.

Mr Barry even had the Jaguar booted on two different occasions and the car had also reportedly been stolen at one point, according to the Times.

Most recently, he picked up a ticket last week -- a day before the crash -- for reportedly parking his car too close to a fire hydrant.

In his defense: Marion Barry claimed on Twitter on Sunday, a day after the accident, that low blood sugar levels caused him to crash

D.C. laws allow city council members and members of Congress to park in 'any available curb space' while on 'official business' -- as long as they don't block hydrants, loading zones or violate rush-hour traffic laws, the Times reports. 

On Monday, two days after the accident, his only son, 34-year-old Christopher, was arrested for driving with a revoked license, according to Fox News. The license had been revoked after he was found to be driving under the influence near the White House in May. 

Last week, even though he had been ordered not to drive because of the May incident, the son was arrested for driving and was found to be in possession of synthetic marijuana, and was subsequently arrested.
