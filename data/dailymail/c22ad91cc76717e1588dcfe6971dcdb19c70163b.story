It used to drive Declan Kidney daft when his Ireland squads were dissected along provincial lines - Munster bias was the undercurrent which annoyed him most.

Come Joe Schmidt’s ascension to the Ireland throne, the allegations changed from red to blue with the New Zealander’s Leinster connections leaving him open to allegations that he favours his old province. Such mutterings are unfair: Kidney will tell you he picked on form and Schmidt will claim likewise.

Yet, despite their natural reservations about the national squad getting analysed along parochial lines, it is still an instructive exercise in the sense that it’s a firm indicator as to how well or not a province is travelling.

Munster and Paul O'Connell (centre) are flying high and sit top of the PRO12 after nine games

Same as they are now, Munster, a year ago, were on top of the PRO12 table after nine rounds - but there the similarity between the then and now ends.

Back then their players were playing in fits and starts. This inconsistency shackled their European performances in defeat to Edinburgh and in fortunate victory over Gloucester and the price paid was having just a meagre total of four players capped by an unimpressed Schmidt in the November 2013 Guinness series.

That selection pattern followed through into the Six Nations, Ireland clinching the title in Paris with a 23-man squad featuring just three Munster players.

However, turn the dial forward towards the end of 2014 and, with Munster doubling up in Europe against Saracens and Sale following a successful Aviva Stadium raid against Leinster, the representative rewards were bountiful last month.

Ten Munster players were capped during the recent three-game Test series, eight as starters, and further evidence of their growing influence on the national team was evident in how eight of their players featured in the 23 chosen against Australia in the series finale.

That generous representation means they are already a year ahead of the objective stated in the strategic plan launched last May where the hope was to provide 30 per cent or more to any Irish national team by 2015/16.

Eight in 23 is effectively 35 per cent, and while that had the consequence of seeing more players away from Munster at a time in the season when they were plotting for the 10-match winter window that will decide their European fate and see their top spot in the league come under pressure (the sequence started in Wales the night before Ireland beat Australia), coach Anthony Foley (right) isn’t overly concerned by the increased demands.

‘I’m not complaining,’ he says. ‘If you are supplying those players they are obviously playing well. We are obviously doing well in competitions so it’s important to keep that going to try and kick on and get a couple of more in there (in the national set-up) without shooting ourselves in the foot altogether.

‘It’s important for us and important for the Munster psyche that we supply players to the national side and that the national side is successful.’

Skipper Peter O’Mahony believes the increased representation has had an uplifting effect on provincial squad morale, adding that the Test exposure enjoyed by so many more of his colleagues this time round is primed to stand them in good stead as they prepare to face Clermont twice in the space of eight days, starting on Saturday in Limerick.

‘It’s a huge help coming back for guys to be driving standards and for guys to realise what it takes at an international stage,’ he said on the impact of the rise in representation from four to 10.

‘The more people you can have around coming back to the club (from Ireland duty) the better, so it was great to have more guys involved and hopefully we can keep driving that on.

‘It’s the closest thing you’re going to get to it,’ he added on how useful that greater Test exposure will be in helping Munster cope with the Clermont threat. ‘They’re similar. French teams coming over here for back-to-back games... it doesn’t get any bigger really.’

The last time O’Mahony grappled with a French outfit in Limerick, he was gone midway through the opening half. A lineout steal against Toulouse back in April didn’t end happily, the back row dislocating his shoulder.

However, while he also went on to have his other shoulder operated on during his lengthy lay-off, he insists there has been no worrying reaction during his two-month-old comeback.

‘No, I’m feeling great, starting to feel normal and fit again. It’s great to get a couple of 80 minutes under the belt at high intensity like that against South Africa and Australia. Great just to get the fitness aspect of it done and feel good again.’

Munster’s feel-good factor has its genesis in a seven-game winning streak that started with the early October win at Leinster, which was O’Mahony’s first outing since his operations.

He’s delighted with the consistency in results but, recognising his side has enjoyed some lucky breaks — such as Ian Humphreys’ late missed conversion that would have won last Friday’s league game for Ulster — he knows they must do better heading into Saturday’s showdown with Clermont.

‘That [winning close games recently] will give us a certain amount of confidence, but we haven’t been overly happy with some of the performances.

‘It is a confidence boost to come out of those scrappy ones with the points but, as I said, we have plenty to work on and plenty to nail off this week.

‘When it comes to Clermont we have to be better all over the park. They’re just such a dangerous side coming out of their 22 on a counter-attack, you name it. They’ve got guys who can punish you from all areas and we have just got to everything nailed on to be competing with these guys.’

Competing and continuing to impress Schmidt, just like they did leading into the November Test window.
