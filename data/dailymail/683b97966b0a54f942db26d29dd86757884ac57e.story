Chelsea Clinton was the butt of jokes at Stanford University in the late 1990s as her father battled impeachment and fended off the national scandal of his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

And first lady Hillary Clinton kept careful track of her experiences in the White House, especially during her ill-fated 1994 'HillaryCare' effort to nationalize the health care industry, confiding in long-time friend Diane Blair that she might one day need her notes for 'revenge.'

The new revelations come from a previously unknown archive of Blair's papers, willed to the university after the political science professor passed away in 2000.

The Washington Free Beacon first unearthed the treasure trove, setting off a mad scramble of journalists eager to scrape up the bombshell collection's remains.

SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE DOCUMENTS

Political science professor Diane Blair (R) kept meticulous notes of her conversations with Hillary Clinton

Photos like this 1992 post-victory snapshot made the rounds on TV at the height of the Clinton impeachment, drawing jeers from Stanford classmates of the then much older Chelsea (L)

Hillary (C), kept notes about friends and foes during her 1994 attempt to reform the U.S. health care system, saying she would need them someday for 'revenge'

Hillary Clinton told Blair that although her daughter Chelsea was a solid student at Stanford, her classmates mocked her whenever they saw family photos of the Clintons.

'2 or 3 hissed; [it] just killed her,' Blair wrote in an excerpt found by ABC News.

But she added that Hillary ultimately did ‘give Bill [Clinton] credit for being aware of pain and anguish he’s caused [Chelsea].'

CNN spotted a reference to a question Hillary Clinton asked Blair about 'how best to preserve her general memories of the administration and of health care in particular.'

On June 20, 1994, Blair's diary mentions that she asked Clinton why she would need notes about the episode.

'Revenge,' Clinton replied.

She also predicted she would need recollections of her staff's insights for a future book project, according to Blair's diary on that same day, 'just to get it down while still fresh, so when everyone else is writing their books, she will have materials – dates, meetings, events, to write hers, and for at least that story to be told.'

Other woman: Monica Lewinsky, the White House intern whose presidential affair launched the Clinton impeachment, testified in the Special Counsel investigation where the president later lied under oath

Chelsea (R) had to put up with Stanford classmates' jokes about her father's dalliance with Lewinsky, and with headlines like one the Daily Mail ran in 1996

But Blair wrote the following January that Hillary decided not to keep any records of personal or 'intimate thoughts and conversations,' for fear of 'subpoenas' in years to come.

Blair first befriended Bill Clinton, who later introduced her to his then-girlfriend Hillary.

Her archived papers include a love letter to an unnamed woman, written by Bill Clinton. It's unclear why she had the letter, raising the possibility of a romantic relationship between the two.

The Free Beacon noted that the intimate letter came with an attached photo of Bill playing the saxophone, telling his lover that 'I thought you might get a kick out of this – I was once even younger.'

Blair was eight years older than the future president, who is one year older than his wife Hillary.

Bill's reference to his 'even younger' self suggests that the letter was written to an older woman.

Water under the bridge: As Hillary ran for president in 2008, Chelsea and Bill were by her side and all seemed forgotten

Fourteen years after the Drudge Report broke the news of the Lewinsky scandal and shamed the U.S. newsweekly that sought to cover it up, the Clintons were all smiles at Chelsea's 2010 wedding to millionaire banker Marc Mezvinzky, the son of a liberal former Pennsylvania congresswoman

The Blair archive caught political fire on Sunday for Hillary's reference to Monica Lewinsky as 'a narcissistic looney-tune.'

Also drawing focus were the conclusions of a secret poll conducted by pollsters Celinda Lake and Stan Greenberg in 1992 that painted Hillary in a horible political light.

'While voters genuinely admire Hillary Clinton’s intelligence and tenacity, they are uncomfortable with these traits in a woman,' the public opinion gurus determined.

'What voters find slick in Bill Clinton, they find ruthless in Hillary.'
