Is this the diet that will see Petr Cech win his battle to be Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper ahead of Thibaut Courtois?

The 32-year-old likes to keep things fruity after he flaunted his lunch on Chelsea's official Twitter account on Friday.

Cech posed for a picture with one bowl of granola and another of fruit as he chowed down in between the club's training base at Istanbul.

Under pressure: Cech faces a battle to be Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper following Thibaut Courtois' return

On the ball: Courtois is looking to be Chelsea's starting goalkeeper after enjoying three years at Atletico Madrid

The Czech stopper faces an almighty tussle to be boss Jose Mourinho's number one following Courtois' return from Atletico Madrid.

Courtois enjoyed three successful seasons out on loan at the Vicente Calderon which culminated in the 22-year-old winning La Liga last season.

Both goalkeeper's will get a chance to stake their claim in the first-team when the Blues face Fenerbahce on Friday night.

The duo each played 45 minutes in Chelsea’s 3-0 pre-season defeat at Werder Bremen on Sunday, with the same playing time expected to be divided again against their Turkish opponents.

Speaking after the match in Germany, Mourinho praised the man he says is the best young goalkeeper in the world but also flagging up how quiet Courtois was on his first outing with his new team-mates.

‘Courtois has only had two days of training, he is not ready. He needs to play, we don’t have lots of time until the beginning of the season – there’s two more weeks so we need to give him more playing time.

‘Petr is the same so the decision was 45-45 here and the next match in Turkey will be exactly the same thing.

‘He [Courtois] had a fabulous save from the [Franco] Di Santo header, after that in the other two goals he has no chance and he was quiet - but the save was fantastic.’
