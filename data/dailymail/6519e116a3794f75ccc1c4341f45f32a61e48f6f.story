Cavanaugh had sent a message to Fischer's girlfriend on Sunday.

The message self destructed in at least 10 seconds - as the app is programmed to do - so enraged Fischer with whatever its contents that the teen then used the phone to send texts back saying 'Come over' and 'I'll kill you man.'

The Daily News reports that the Wando High School junior took Fischer up on it and found himself in a brawl at the Mount Pleasant house.

Fischer finished the battle by fatally stabbing the teen in the torso before fleeing.
