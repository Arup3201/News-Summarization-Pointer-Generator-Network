Examiners have included JB Priestley's classic 'An Inspector Calls' on the GCSE syllabus

British authors including J.B.Priestley and Meera Syal dominate a new English Literature GCSE amid the dropping of classic American fiction.

To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee and John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men have been ditched by an exam board, along with Arthur Miller’s A View From the Bridge.

Instead, teenagers will focus on Japanese-born British novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, George Orwell and English playwrights Dennis Kelly and Charlotte Keatley.

OCR has blamed the decision on 
Education Secretary Michael Gove’s desire for English Literature to be 
‘more focused on tradition’ and fewer opportunities to include such 
texts on the British dominated syllabus.

It
 yesterday published proposed new content for English Literature GCSEs 
as more than 50,000 people signed a petition, protesting at government 
reforms to the exams.

The new courses will be taught in schools from next September, following accreditation by regulator, Ofqual.

Pupils face a two-hour paper on ‘exploring modern and literary heritage texts’.

Schools must choose one set text from a choice of four British novels and two plays as well as a 19th century book.

The
 modern texts are: Meera Syal’s Anita and Me; Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let
 Me Go; George Orwell’s Animal Farm; J.B.Priestley’s An Inspector Calls;
 Charlotte Keatley’s My Mother Said I Never Should and Dennis Kelly’s 
DNA.

The 19th century prose includes Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations; Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice; H.G.Wells’ The War Of The Worlds; Robert Louise Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre.

An ‘exploring poetry and Shakespeare’ section features Romeo and Juliet, The Merchant of Venice, Macbeth and Much Ado About Nothing.

In the previous OCR specification, under ‘prose from different cultures’, pupils could study Of Mice and Men; To Kill A Mockingbird; Anita and Me; Amy Tan’s The Joy Luck Club; Roddy Doyle’s Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha and Athol Fugard’s Tsotsi.

However, the decision to drop Harper Lee's Pulitzer prize winning 'To Kill A Mockingbird' has been criticised by campaigners

A View From A Bridge used to feature in a ‘modern drama’ section, along with R.C. Sherriff’s Journey’s End; Willy Russell’s Educating Rita; Harold Brighouse’ s Hobson’s Choice and Alan Bennett’s The History Boys.

Paul Dodd, OCR’s head of GCSE and A-level reform, said: ‘While the restrictions mean that there is no room for texts such as Of Mice and Men or To Kill a Mocking Bird, the new syllabus does include exciting additions such as the play DNA by Dennis Kelly and Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go, both appearing for the first time.

‘We understand of course that the new syllabus will be a challenge for teachers (..)  but we will be with them every step of the way.’

He added: ‘The essential thing is that in the new GCSE English Literature you cannot do fiction or drama from 1914 unless it is British. This cuts out John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men and other similar texts.’

The Department for Education has insisted that its document about content for the subject, published last year, ‘doesn’t ban any authors, books or genres’.

New English Literature GCSE courses must include at least one play by Shakespeare, at least one nineteenth century novel, a selection of poetry since 1789 including representative Romantic poetry and ‘fiction or drama from the British Isles from 1914 onwards’.

Exam boards can add extra books, but OCR has pointed out that the rules leave very left little room for 20th century writing outside Britain.

Mary Stevens, an English teacher from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, who has launched a petition against the reforms, said: ‘Do we teach literature in English or the literature of England?’

She added: ‘By telling us we have to teach Romantic poets, a 19th century novel, a Shakespeare play and a British text, he (Gove) is taking choice away from teachers; that is the reality.

‘This doesn’t broaden the curriculum in real terms.’

Referring to the reforms, a Department for Education spokesman said: ‘That is only the minimum pupils will be expected to learn. It is now up to exam boards to design new GCSEs, which must then be accredited by the independent exams regulator Ofqual.’

Meanwhile five per cent of marks in the OCR English Literature GCSE will be allocated to accurate spelling, punctuation and grammar and 20 per cent in English Language.
