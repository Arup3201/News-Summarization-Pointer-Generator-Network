The slow-motion camera can capture some of the most beautiful and amazing sights in the world.

Whether it be a shark bursting out of the sea, a bird catching it's prey mid-flight, or a daredevil thrill-seeker leaping off a building, catching this action in 'slow-mo' keeps the memory alive.

Yet for this youngster, the video-reel might want to be one memory to forget.

Eliott Terry makes a vain attempt to protect his face with his hands...

Lining up in the garden for a 'kick around,' a resulting football booted into his face, and cue the tears, Elliott Terry's small screen moment is captured perfectly by his father Liam.

The action was captured on Sony Experia Z3, where by using TimeLapse, you capture the sequence at a high frame rate, and then add a slow-motion to the sections you want to.

Elliott's brother Oliver, who takes the offending kick appears to turn to the camera as if to say, 'ready,' before chipping the ball to his unsuspecting sibling.

But this is only going one way - and it's not good for Elliott

The football cuts through the youngster's defence quite easily

The slow-motion captures the impact perfectly; Elliott's hands come up to his face in a vain effort to protect himself, but it's too late as the ball lands flush.

Oliver, realising he may have inadvertently injured his brother, puts his hand to his mouth in shock. Meanwhile a young girl dressed as a princess, who watched open-mouthed on impact, goes to trap the ball as the game comes to an abrupt halt.

Then there's the expected tears as the game goes horribly wrong

The expression of the young girl dressed as a princess is priceless as she looks on open-mouthed

The video then resumes to normal speed, with the expected tears and crying as the injured party's fun is over, and he exits stage left. 

Dad Terry, who lives with his family In Melbourne, Australia, told Mail Online: 'I had got a new phone the day before. They were kicking the ball for 20 minutes before I decided to film and that's what I got.'

'He (Oliver) was fine as well, he cried for 10 seconds, then I showed him the video and he is happy!'
