The man whose 'keen observational skills and strong sense of civic duty' led Dallas police to Lee Harvey Oswald was honoured yesterday on the 48th anniversary of John F Kennedy's assassination.

Johnny Calvin Brewer received the department's Citizen's Certificate Of Merit and praised for his selfless act and 'exemplary conduct' on November 22, 1963.

Dallas Police Chief David Brown presented the 70-year-old with his award at the Texas Theater, the location where Oswald was captured around 80 minutes after Kennedy was killed.

After accepting the award and watching a video of his 22-year-old self recounting the events of that day, Mr Brewer said: 'I'm just so overwhelmed.'

Then
a manager at a shoe store located about 90 yards from the Oak Cliff 
neighbourhood cinema, Mr Brewer was listening to news coverage of the 
president's assassination when he heard reports that a Dallas police 
officer, JD Tippit, had just been killed a few blocks away.

A man whose behaviour seemed suspicious then walked into the foyer of the shoe store.

Mr Brewer said the man stared at the display in the window and acted scared as police cars with blaring sirens raced by.

After the last squad car passed in 
one direction, the man stepped out of the shop and walked in the 
opposite direction towards the cinema.

Mr
Brewer saw him go into the theatre without buying a ticket. He followed
him, alerting the woman in the box office to call police.

Lee Harvey Oswald was born on October 18, 1939 in New Orleans.

Raised by his mother Marguerite after his father died before he was born, Oswald and his two older brothers moved around the U.S. and were even put up for adoption for a period of 13 months.

At 17, he joined the U.S. Marines and qualified as a sharpshooter before defecting to the Soviet Union for a brief period from October 1959 to June 1962.

It was in Russia, in March 1961, that Oswald met Marina Prusakova, a 19-year-old pharmacology student.

They married less than six weeks later in April 1961 and had a daughter, June, in February the following year. In May 1962, the couple visited the U.S. embassy in Moscow to apply for a visa so Marina could move to America.

The family travelled to the U.S. in June and settled in the Dallas / Fort Worth area of Texas.

On the night of April 10, 1963, Oswald shot at anti-communist Major General Edwin Walker with his rifle. He confessed his crime to his wife and that he then buried the weapon that night.

Seven months later, he was arrested in a Dallas cinema on suspicion of murdering police officer JD Tippit some 40 minutes after Kennedy's assassination.

Oswald protested his innocence and was himself shot dead by nightclub owner Jack Ruby just two days later as he exited a police station surrounded by officers and the press.

Although the Warren Commission concluded that he had acted alone in killing Kennedy, the House Select Committee On Assassinations in 1979 concluded that he had 'probably' not acted alone.

The debate as to whether Oswald was a lone gunman or part of a wider conspiracy continues to this day.

Mr Brewer then shared his suspicions 
with the concessions operator and the two searched the theatre and stood
by the emergency exits.

Hearing noise behind his alley-exit 
door, Mr Brewer opened it only to have police guns aimed at him. The 
cinema lights went on and Mr Brewer pointed out the suspicious man 
seated in the theatre.

Oswald was arrested after a brief scuffle, during which he punched an officer and pulled a gun.As
he was taken from the theatre he hollered: 'I am not resisting arrest,'
according to testimony Mr Brewer gave to the Warren Commission that 
investigated the president's death.

Oswald
was shot and killed two days later by nightclub owner Jack Ruby in the 
basement of police headquarters while being transferred to the county 
jail.

Since then, Mr 
Brewer has served in the Navy and then moved to Austin, where he still 
lives, having retired from a career in sales.

Beaming
family members, including two grandchildren, and friends who called him
a humble man, were on hand for Tuesday's ceremony.

Deputy Police Chief Randy Blankenbaker said: 'Mr. Brewer made a difference in the history of the United States.

'You not only helped us capture the 
man who shot the president of the United States but you also helped us 
capture a man who killed one of our police officers.'

Patrolman Tippit's widow expressed her gratitude to Mr Brewer, as did retired Dallas police officer Ray Hawkins.

Mr Hawkins, who handcuffed Oswald 
that fateful day, said: 'I think it's a little late, but I'm glad he's 
finally getting recognition. He's deserving.'

Chief Brown speculated that the 
tribute did not occur sooner because Dallas has been trying to move away
from the tragedy it's been associated with for so long that 'many of 
the details of the actions by citizens like Mr. Brewer have been left 
behind'.

But Chief Brown, who became the 
city's most senior officer last year, said as the department began 
trying to revisit its legacy and history, Mr Brewer's story just 'jumped
out'.

Last year, 
Farris Rookstool III, a former FBI analyst and JFK historian, brought 
their attention to Temple F Bowley, who climbed in to Tippit's squad car
moments after he was slain and used the police radio to call for help.

After Mr Bowley was issued a 
commendation, the chief asked Mr Rookstool if there was anyone else who 
was missed and research revealed Mr Brewer.

Chief Brown made a point of 
correcting that oversight 'as quickly as possible', saying, 'Thank God 
we were able to find him and he's still with us.'

The
chief said the department will keep looking for those 'whose 
extraordinary actions helped bring closure to one of the more tragic' 
events for the city and the nation.
