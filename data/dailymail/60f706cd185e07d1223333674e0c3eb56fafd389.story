Former President George H.W. Bush, who has been hospitalized in Houston since November, may be released from the facility in the coming days, a family spokesman said on Sunday.

'We are hopeful that the president can be discharged this coming week, but we're still taking everything one day at a time,' spokesman Jim McGrath said in an email.

Bush's son, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, said on Saturday that his father was expected to be released from the hospital on Monday, according to TCPalm.com.

The former president, 88, who led a 
coalition that pushed Iraqi forces out of Kuwait in 1991, was admitted 
to Methodist Hospital on November 23 for bronchitis and then transferred
 to intensive care in December after coming down with a persistent fever
 and other complications.

He was moved to a regular patient room after 
his condition improved last month.

Bush has lower-body parkinsonism, which causes a loss of balance, and he has used a wheelchair for more than a year.

The 41st president, who is also the 
father of former President George W. Bush, served as a congressman, 
ambassador to the United Nations, envoy to China, CIA director and as 
vice president for two terms under President Ronald Reagan.

Bush, the nation's 41st president, is the country's oldest living former president by a few months.

As well as visits on Christmas Day, the
 41st president has also been visited at least twice by his sons, George W. Bush,
 the 43rd president, and Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida.

Bush and
 his wife, Barbara, live in Houston during the winter and spend their 
summers in a home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
