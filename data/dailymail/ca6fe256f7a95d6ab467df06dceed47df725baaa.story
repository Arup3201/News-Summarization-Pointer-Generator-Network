Police believe a 78-year-old man shot dead his daughter, 39, and 11-year-old granddaughter in a tragic murder-suicide at their home in Seattle, Washington on Monday. 

The bodies of grandfather Honorario Yango, his daughter Christine Dela Isla and granddaughter Anahlia Cowherd were found by local police around 8:15pm after the suspected shooter's 10-year-old grandson called 911.

While police have not yet released a motive in the murder-suicide, Anahlia's personal blog tells the shocking story of how she was allegedly sexually-abused by her grandfather for years and how he threatened to kill her just hours before her death.

Police have not released a motive for the murder. Just hours before her death, Anahlia wrote a blog post about her grandfather allegedly threatening to kill her 

In the aftermath of the murder-suicide, Anahlia's distant father Terrell Cowherd discovered a blog his daughter appears to have been writing for months, in which she claimed her grandfather had been molesting her since she was in the third grade.

The same day as her murder, Anahlia wrote a frantic post on that same blog saying her grandfather had threatened to kill her.

In a post titled 'Help... Me...' Anahlia writes: 'He threatened me... He actually threatened to KILL my family. Right now I'm in my mom's room, the door locked, my dog close, my brother here, my Grandpa somewhere, my Grandma is not home. My mom is coming...I'm so scared.'   

Above, the scene of the horrific murder-suicide on Monday. In blog posts written in the seven months leading up to the shooting, 11-year-old Anahlia claimed her grandfather was sexually abusing her

Anahlia posted a series of disturbing accounts on Wattpad, a free use website where writers can post their work and members can browse through the content and exchange ideas.

The blog had been up for months, but Anahlia wrote her name for the first time on the website hours before she was killed.

She posted: 'I’m Anahlia Chandris Cowherd, 11 years old, in 5th grade, and I’m gonna bring justice to all girls who have been touched.'

News that her posts have been online for a considerable amount of time has raised questions about how they remained unreported.

'Where is the level of accountability for a social media page to share information. How in the world can anybody, including wattpad, have knowledge of this and NEVER call the police?' one user wrote today under her final post.

According to Wattpad, 35 million people have joined their digital community and members currently spend 9 billion minutes a month engaging in the content.

Earlier this year a One Direction fan's online fantasy fiction about the boyband which was posted on Wattpad, proved so popular that it has won her a six-figure publishing deal.

Anna Todd, a 25-year-old from Texas, decided to try her hand at fan fiction after stumbling upon Wattpad, which has an entire section dedicated to fan fiction.

Mr Cowherd, who hasn't seen his daughter since she was six years old, was able to find his Anahlia's Wattpad blog online after simply searching her name. Though her username is anonymous, Anahlia names herself in one piece she wrote more than six months ago, in which she details long-term sexual abuse at the hands of her grandfather.

'When I Googled my daughter's name, the blog popped up,' Mr Cowherd told KIRO. 'The only conclusion I can come to is that she must have actually got to the point where she was about to call police, and I guess that was his way of preventing her from doing so.'

In the initial confessional post, Anahlia writes that her grandfather has been touching her since she was about eight or nine years old.

She also wrote about finally telling her mom about the abuse, and it appears Ms Dela Isla came to her daughter's defense.

'My mom said the next f****** time he does this she's gonna call the police,' Anahlia wrote at the time. 

While Anahlia appears triumphant in the post, vowing to 'bring justice to all girls who have been touched', her posts in the following months become more and more helpless.

About a month later, Anahlia writes that her grandfather has started molesting her again, and she starts writing about cutting herself and wanting to die. 

Anahlia's 10-year-old younger brother was the only witness and survivor of the murder-suicide. 

Yango has no criminal history.  

He told officers his grandfather had first waved a handgun at his mother and sister before shooting them, and had then turned the gun on himself.

Assistant Police Chief Nick Metz said the boy was 'shaken up' but unhurt. He has been placed in the care of his extended family. 

Seattle's mayor Ed Murray, who also attended the scene on Monday night, said the shooting appeared to be a 'family tragedy'. 

Anahlia writes that her mother - Christine Dela Isla, pictured - threatened to call the police if her grandfather touched her again. The girl's distant father Terrell Cowherd believes the prospect of being revealed as a pedophile may have led Yango to kill the girls and himself

He added: 'One thing I would say is the neighborhood itself is safe.' 

Students at Aki Kruose Middle School, where Anahlia was a student, were sent home with a letter from the principal on Tuesday about the incident. 

'As a community, I know we will come together to not only support the surviving family members, but work to ensure our larger community is a safe place for us to live, learn and work,' Principal Mia Williams wrote.

Police said there were only four people in the house at the time, confirming the dead man was the adult woman's father and the teenage girl's grandfather
