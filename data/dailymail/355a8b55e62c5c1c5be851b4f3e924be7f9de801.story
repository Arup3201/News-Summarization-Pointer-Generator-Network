Eight men have been jailed for 'inciting debauchery' after appearing in an alleged same-sex wedding video in Egypt.

The men, who formed the wedding party on a boat on the Nile, were sentenced to three years in prison each for the crime of debauchery. 

The clip, posted online as 'Egypt's first gay wedding,' shows two men exchanging rings and embracing while friends cheer. 

In September, a statement from the office of Egypt's chief prosecutor said the video was 'shameful to God' and 'offensive to public morals.'

Today's verdict sentenced each of the men who appeared in an alleged same-sex prison to three years in jail

Although being gay is not illegal in Egypt, the men who appeared in the video were arrested last month and 'tested' for homosexuality.

Officials subsequently said that they'd 'tested negative for homosexuality'.  

Precisely what the test involved has not been revealed, but it is thought to be an intrusive anal examination.

The verdict is the latest in a crackdown by authorities against gays and atheists. The campaign also targets liberal and pro-democracy activists and violators of a draconian law on street protests.

Prosecutor General Hisham Barakat said the video 'violates public decency', but the Human Rights Watch have said that anal examinations 'violate international standards against torture'.

Earlier this year, an Egyptian court convicted four men of committing 'homosexual acts' and sentenced them to up to eight years in prison.

Police arrested the men for holding parties they say involved homosexual acts and where they found women's clothes and makeup.

Three of the four received eight years while one received three years with hard labour.

In 2011, a high profile trial of 52 men accused of being gay caught international attention and drew criticism from rights groups.

Twenty-three of them were sentenced to up to five years in prison while the rest were acquitted.

Although homosexuality is not illegal in Egypt, the men were convicted of debauchery, which is against the law

Egypt's crackdown is taking place as the country of nearly 90 million people appears to be steadily moving to the right, with jingoism and xenophobia dominating the media
