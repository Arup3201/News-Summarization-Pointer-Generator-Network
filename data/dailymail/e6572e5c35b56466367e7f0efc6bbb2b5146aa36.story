The World Cup is just 29 days away and excitement is building. Each week our man in Brazil, Joe Callaghan, brings us the latest news and views from South America - as well as traveller tips for those heading out there - and provides a flavour of exactly how the World Cup in Brazil is shaping up.

If Zico's so worried, shouldn't England be a little bit concerned too? With all the focus on the World Cup opener against top seeds Italy in the Amazon a month from today, Uruguay are in danger of flying a little under Roy Hodgson's radar.

Not Zico's though. We told you last week how the greatest never to win a World Cup insisted the one team he didn't want Brazil to meet in the knock-out stages was none other than England's second opponents next month. 

'I would prefer to meet Argentina in the final. Not Uruguay,' he said. 'I think Uruguay could be the only team who could psychologically shake the Brazilian team.'

Dangerous: Luis Suarez is expected to cause England problems in the Group D World Cup match in Brazil

Geographically, Uruguay sits beneath Brazil and citizens here like to think of their neighbours that way.

But in the Brazilian sporting lexicon Uruguay is a dirty word. It might come as a surprise to some that no matter what way the tournament progresses, the hosts cannot play at the Maracana until the final.

Wouldn't the sacred, spiritual home have been a helpful, inspirational staging point come the last 16 or quarter-finals? Not in a World Cup it wouldn't.

The place is the graveyard of World Cup dreams here and the Maracanazo, when Brazil needing only a draw to win the 1950 cup on home soil imploded and handed glory to their noisy neighbours, still send shivers down spines in Rio de Janeiro.

Hodgson might just have felt a slight chill over the past 48 hours too when he saw the 25-man squad assembled by his counterpart Oscar Tabarez. High on talent, high on tenure, high on terrifying attackers, it's a big tournament calibre squad from a country that just loves big tournaments.

Fearful: Brazil legend Zico believes that Uruguay are the team best equipped to cause the hosts problems

Winners of two of the four previous World Cups to be played in their home continent, Uruguay have also been losing semi-finalists another three times. All in all, not too shabby a record for a country with an almost identical population to Wales.

Hodgson's embraced the movement for change and called upon his young lions, but experience counts too. Uruguay have just three players with 10 caps or less in their panel and could have just one by the time the final squad cut is made. England on the other hand, will bring nine such inexperienced men to Brazil.

Of course there are question marks, no country is immune from those. A lot of those centre on the skipper Diego Lugano, who endured a horror campaign in the Premier League with West Brom. But he has always been a different beast with the national team's armband strapped on.

And around him, Benfica's Maxi Perreira, Atletico Madrid's Diego Godin and Martin Caceres of Juventus could join camp with league winners medals from three different countries.

Goal getter: Uruguay's Edinson Cavani has proven himself to be a reliable frontman at the top level

Midfield is full of competition with three insiders based here in Brazil - Nicolas Lodeiro, Sebastien Eguren and Alvaro Pareira - joining Atletico's Cristian Rodriguez and a host of other European-based veterans and a couple of younger faces, among them Southampton's Gaston Ramirez.

It is up front though where the chills really begin to kick in. The triumvirate of Luis Suarez, Edinson Cavani and Diego Forlan might not match Argentina's trio of Messi, Higuain and Aguero as the tournament's most ferocious front three. But they're a close runner-up. Between them they have scored 94 international goals. England's entire 23-man squad have scored just 15 more.

For now, all roads may lead to Manaus but the trajectory will quickly shift to Sao Paulo and what will be the defining match of England's campaign. Uruguay may have been the last team to book their ticket to Brazil but it would be foolish to expect them to be the first going home.

Even if it would make the hosts breathe a whole lot easier.

Lots to think about: England's players face two tough group games against Italy and Uruguay in Brazil

The countdown clock has hit the 20s and still Brazil scrambles to welcome the world. Incredible though it may seem four weeks out from the kick-off, but three stadiums still remain unfinished.

The venue for the opening ceremony will mercifully host its first proper match this weekend when Corinthians make their debut in their new home. Because they simply have to be, all arenas will be completed.

But a report in yesterday's Sao Paulo newspaper Folha, laid bare just how little else will be ready. Of the public transport upgrades and projects promised when Brazil won the staging rights, an eye-wateringly low 10 per cent have been delivered.

Fortaleza's airport might just be the most prime of all examples. The city which had the first stadium over the line, inexplicably none of the other 11 projects promised in Fortaleza are finished.

And instead of a shiny new terminal to welcome the hundreds of thousands of fans pitching up for a whopping six games in the city, visitors will instead be herded through a temporary canvas structure.

If you're thinking something along the lines of the opening credits of M.A.S.H. you're not alone. It's unlikely to be nearly as funny though. It's a crying shame.

Way behind schedule: Construction workers frantically try to finish off the Arena de Sao Paulo Stadium on time

Not only did he welcome new plus one Gabriella Lenzi to Barcelona this week for a flying visit during which she hit the town with the WAGs but he might just feature in this weekend's title decider against Atletico Madrid.

Expected not to play a competitive game again until the World Cup after picking up a foot injury last month, Brazil's talisman is ahead of schedule.

'I am in the home straight in terms of recovery and I’ll see if I am able to play (against Atletico),' he confirmed on Monday. And the nation breathes a sigh of relief.

Introductions: Neymar's girlfriend Gabriella Lenzi joined the Brazil superstar briefly in Barcelona

The Brazilian championship is a full four rounds old. But that's more than enough time for the most trigger-happy league in the world to start catching up with the Premier League in the sack race.

This Fred goal from a couple of inches out helped Fluminense to a 2-0 victory over arch rivals Flamengo in the Rio derby on Sunday. It led to Flamengo sacking Jayme de Almeida, who in the process became the sixth manager shown the door in the top tier already this season.

Sixth...in less than a month. Makes England's top flight look like a pleasant place to work

Remember me? Diego Cavalieri (Fluminese and Brazil)

The rejection felt by Liverpool duo Philippe Coutinho and Lucas last week as Big Phil ignored the merits of both when picking his final squad was also shared by a former Red.

Diego Cavalieri once cost Liverpool £3million when he joined from Palmeiras in 2008. But after just two seasons at Anfield during which he never once featured in the league, in spite of a couple of impressive cup cameos, he was allowed to leave by Roy Hodgson.

Back home with Fluminense he rediscovered his form and was part of the Confederations Cup-winning Brazil panel last summer. But he was the odd man out last week as Julio Cesar, Jefferson and Victor were picked for World Cup duty.

That's kind of in keeping with how things have been going for everyone linked with Liverpool of late.

Scurge: Mosquitos will be feasting on the many World Cup visitors

Travellers tip: Bring the bug spray

Not brave enough to venture up to Manaus? Then you don't have to worry about tropical diseases, right?

Wrong. Dengue fever is alive and really kicking throughout Brazil, even in urban centres with 1.4million cases last year.

Speaking from painful experience, native mosquitoes take a particular shine to pasty European skin.

So pack the strongest bug spray lawmakers will let you bring on a plane.

Amazon forecast: How’s the weather up in Manaus?

We finally got some first-hand experience of just how hot and wet it gets up there during a brief visit last weekend.

There is not a garment invented by man that can soak up all the sweat when the humidity hits.

Thankfully
 though, the next tropical downpour is never too far away and a socking 
rain is actually pretty refreshing. Small mercies.
