France Football magazine has stoked the fires ahead of Chelsea's visit to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Tuesday night by branding Jose Mourinho a 's***-stirrer.'

The Blues manager features on the front cover of their latest edition with the unflattering nickname 'L'Emmerdeur', which translates as a 'pain in the neck.'

But inside, in their preview of the last 16, first leg clash at the Parc des Princes, they label Mourinho 'l'emerdeur professionnel' or the aforementioned insult.

France Football magazine have labelled Jose Mourinho a 'pain in the neck' and a 's***-stirrer' ahead of Chelsea's Champions League tie with Paris Saint-Germain

And even PSG's official Twitter account has joined in the pre-match 'banter', posting mocked-up pictures of the Queen and Winston Churchill wearing scarves in their club colours.

They started on Monday night with a Photoshopped image of the bronze statue of the wartime British Prime Minister on Avenue Winston-Churchill in the heart of Paris.

The 10ft high statue, which was unveiled by the Queen in 1998, is shown with a PSG scarf around the neck.

And the French champions followed that up with a likeness of the Queen in the Musee Grevin wearing a red, blue and white scarf around her neck.

Their message read: 'Hey @ChelseaFC, it seems like W. Churchill is not the only one ready for tonight... #GodSaveTheQueen #ADifferentStory'.

The 'different story' hastag is in reference to last season's Champions League quarter-finals, when Chelsea eliminated PSG on the away goals rule after the tie ended 3-3 on aggregate.

On Monday, they tweeted a message saying: 'Revenge is a dish best served... one year later.'

Despite the 'banter', PSG are very much the underdogs entering the match. Laurent Blanc's side are in the grip of an injury crisis, with Yohan Cabaye, Marquinhos, Lucas Moura and Serge Aurier suffering knocks in their weekend draw with Caen.

While PSG sit third in Ligue 1, behind leaders Lyon and Marseille, Chelsea are seven-points clear at the Premier League summit and had the luxury of a free weekend following their early exit from the FA Cup.
