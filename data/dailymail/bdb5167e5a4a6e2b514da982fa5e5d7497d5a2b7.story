Prime Minister Tony Abbott's round the world trip got off to a turbulent start after his plane suffered technical issues on the tarmac.

Mr Abbott is due to meet Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Batam Island later on Wednesday to improve relations damaged by spying revelations and asylum seeker policies.

But his departure from Canberra was delayed for several hours due to technical problems with his RAAF jet.

A replacement jet had to be brought in.

Defence Minister David Johnston said the jet breakdown was probably not a good look for the Royal Australian Air Force.

'But we do have a back-up plane for exactly that reason,' he said.

'I'm determined to fix it very quickly.

'These aircraft are very old, they're well maintained, they're very serviceable but there are some issues with age and we've got to deal with them and we need to trade out of them.'

After Indonesia, the prime minister is set to travel to France with other world leaders for the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, before meeting with French President Francois Hollande in Paris.

He will then head to Ottawa for meetings with business leaders and Prime Minister Stephen Harper, followed by talks with US President Barack Obama in Washington DC.

'It will be another opportunity for me to demonstrate that Australia is open for business,' Mr Abbott said before leaving.

'It will be a further opportunity for me to bolster Australia's economic and national security.'

Mr Abbott dismissed suggestions he should remain in Australia to get his first budget through a hostile parliament.

'It's always good to be improving Australia's international relations,' he said.

A 20-member business delegation will accompany Mr Abbott to New York and Houston.
