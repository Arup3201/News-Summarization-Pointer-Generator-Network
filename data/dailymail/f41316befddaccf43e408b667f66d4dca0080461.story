Juventus may be three points clear atop Serie A and a possible contender for this season's Champions League, but president Andrea Agnelli fears the Italian league will not be enticing enough to keep the club's top talent for years to come.

Andrea Agnelli believes the reputation Serie A has across Europe will see Juve's prized players such as Paul Pogba and Arturo Vidal eventually leave the club. 

'What is true is that Serie A is a transit league,' Agnelli told ESPN FC.

'We are not a final destination anymore. The risk is for great players to come here, acquire status, and then leave to become top stars abroad.'

Pogba, who impressed for France at the World Cup in Brazil this year, has been repeatedly linked with a transfer to Chelsea.

Vidal, meanwhile, was the subject of regular reports in the summer suggesting he was going to join Manchester United.

But Agnelli wants Pogba and Vidal, along the rest of the club's stars, to remain at the club for many years to come.

Juventus president Andrea Agnelli is concerned that Juventus may lose its top players to clubs abroad

'Last year everybody was saying that Pogba and Vidal were ready to leave Juventus, but they didn't,' Agnelli said.

'Our goal is to keep on building our team and Pogba and Vidal are part of this process. This Juventus team is a crop of players that could easily be ranked in the top eight in Europe.'
