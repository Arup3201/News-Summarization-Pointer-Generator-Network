A camper has been killed after a huge tree fell onto this tent during a vicious storm.

Kyle Garrett, 48, from  Sandpoint, Idaho, was found dead at the Stagger Inn Campground in eastern Washington on Sunday night after the 200-foot tree fell on him.

A 52-year-old female camper was also hit by the tree and is being treated for injuries which are not life-threatening.

Jason Kirchner, with the U.S. Forest Service, said the storm caused a number of trees to weaken and fall in the Idaho Panhandle National Forest.

He said Forest Service workers are now assessing the campsites in the region to check for potentially dangerous trees.

As reported by the Idaho Statesman, Mary Farnsworth, from Idaho Panhandle 
National Forest,  said: 'We are deeply saddened by the tragic accident at our campground and are
 making every effort to ensure that last night's storm damage has not 
left hazard trees in our developed recreation sites.'

The Forest Service said it will use an incident management team - similar to those used when dealing with wildfires and other emergencies -  to assess the campgrounds before the Labor Day holiday weekend.

Officials at the Forest Service said visitors should be cautious of trees that have damage to roots, branches or trunks.

They are also advised to be wary of trees that appear to be infested with insects or are leaning or dead.

Stagger Inn is a small campsite in Pend Oreille County, west of the Idaho state 
line.

The Forest Service says there are 'four primitive camp/picnic sites' at Stagger Inn.
