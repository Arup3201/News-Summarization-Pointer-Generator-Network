A billionaire mining mogul has paid more than £46million for a London flat in one of the UK's most expensive public property deals, it was revealed today.

Aristotelis Mistakidis, head of copper at mining giant Glencore and in the top 50 richest men in Britain, bought the duplex apartment in the exclusive Chesham Place, Belgravia.

The luxury flat, which boasts 7,900sq/ft of space, was developed by the Candy brothers - Nick and Christian - who have built up a shared wealth of hundreds of millions in less than 20 years.

The property, designed by Lord Norman Foster, has a master bedroom suite, four guest bedrooms, a large living area and staff quarters, two underground car parking spaces and a 24-hour concierge.

The duplex, built in 2008, was sold for £46million - making it the third highest sale ever logged with the Land Registry.

And the £5,800 per sq/ft price is a record for Belgravia, home to the likes of Roman Abramovich and Nigella Lawson. 

According to Land Registry figures, the most expensive property ever sold is on The Boltons in Kensington, which was sold for £55million in 2012. 

The second was a penthouse on Princes Gate which sold last year for £50million.

The record sale could be higher because in Britain if you buy a property through a company it does not have to be logged with the Land Registry.

Aristotelis Mistakidis is a British billionaire who was born in Greece.

Described as a self-made man he has risen to become head of zinc, copper and lead mining giant Glencore.

He is worth an estimated £1.5billion, making him the 46th richest person in the UK. He is also in the top 850 wealthiest people in the world.  

Mr Mistakidis joined Glencore in 1993 and was in charge of its zinc, copper and lead commodity department in 2000.

He is also a director of Katanga Mining and Recylex, and is chairman of Glencore unit Mopani Copper Mines.

Before that he studied at the London School of Economics and worked for U.S. trading giant Cargill. 

He is said to split his time between Switzerland and London.

Rokstone, the central London estate agency, were the selling agents for Chesham Place. Becky Fatemi, the company director, declined to discuss the parties involved.

It is understood there were three ultra high net worth individuals (UHNWI) who offered the asking price for the property.

But Mr Mistakidis, 53, who is based in Switzerland, managed to get a deal done first, according to official Land Registry documents.

Simon Barnes, a high-end property consultant, says it is rare a home of this value is bought by an individual.

He said: 'I have been dealing with these sorts of properties for 30 years and historically they are traded through companies, which helps maintain a level of anonymity.

'Chesham Place is phenomenal. You're not just talking about a flat in Belgravia.

'Candy and Candy have done a fantastic job - the presentation and finish is very good. It ticks all boxes and you couldn't replicate it.'

On top of a sizeable estate agency commission, the treasury has also benefited from the sale - with Mr Mistakidis paying £3.2 million in stamp duty.

However, this is small change to the businessman, who took a £45 million dividend last year.

And when Glencore floated in 2011, Mr Mistakidis's shares in the company were valued at more than £2 billion.

Design: Architect Lord Foster was involved in the design of the flats in the luxury development, which contains six apartments

Grand: The flat is believed to have several spacious terraces, including one like this, and also has a media room and drawing room

Nick and Christian Candy bought 21 Chesham Place in 2005 for £13 million, with the former BT telephone exchange their first major development.

After a year of difficulties with local authorities, they were then granted planning permission to convert 80,000sq/ft property into six luxury flats, immediately doubling the value of the property.

The brothers, who are behind One Hyde Park, commissioned Lord Norman Foster, regarded as one of Britain's best architects, to design the flats with Candy & Candy responsible for the interior design.

A spokesperson for Candy & Candy declined to comment.

Only one other property - a penthouse on Princes Gate - has publicly sold for more in the last 12 months after it went for £50 million.

A flat in One Hyde Park, which is the Candy Brothers' halo development, recently sold for £21.5 million.

Henry Pryor, a buying agent, said: 'If property developers were Premier League footballers, everyone would be trying to sign the Candy Brothers in this transfer window.

'It is a very significant transaction, all the more so that it was bought in the public domain, and not under a corporate wrap.'

How Russia's oligarchs have started a new stampede for high-end London property to protect their wealth from country's collapsing economy 

Hundreds of Russian oligarchs are preparing to buy swathes of ultra-expensive property in London to protect their wealth against the country's crumbling economy, experts have said.

Last month six buyers in a few days have contacted luxury London agents Beauchamp Estates and requested £100million homes in upmarket Mayfair, Belgravia and Kensington in order to get their money out of Moscow.

Beauchamp has also seen a 10 per cent spike in requests from Russian buyers as panic about an economic collapse spread ahead of the country's currency plunge.

Two days after the first Russian sanctions came into effect in April, Penthouse D was bought for £140million by an Eastern European, sparking speculation it was a Russian trying to secure their cash

The new wave of investors will further tighten Russia's grip on London's super-prime market, as they already buy one in five of the capital's most expensive properties. 

The rouble went into free-fall last month as its value dropped by up to 20 per cent against the dollar, an all-time low, causing tech company Apple to suspend sales of its products online today.

While ordinary Russian citizens flocked to Ikea as the budget store warned of price rises, the country's super-elite trained their sights on the London property market.

Gary Hersham, managing director of Beauchamp Estates, said: 'The rouble has seen a massive collapse in value. 

'Wealthy Russians are desperate to get their money out of Moscow at present, and we have seen a 10 per cent upturn in Russian clients since the decline in value and the international sanctions biting into the Russian economy. 

'I currently have half a dozen Russian clients urgently looking to spend over £20million each on buying a new home in prime Central London'.
