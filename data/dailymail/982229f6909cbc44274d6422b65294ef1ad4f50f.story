Marterrance Albury, four, was found in this road on Sunday in Tampa, Florida. He later died in hospital from injuries he sustained after being reportedly thrown from an SUV

The boy was in the care of his 17-year-old brother at the time of his death, a police statement revealed today, after his mother, Johntea Williams, 36, went on a night out with a friend.

Approximately 20-30 minutes after the incident, the victim's 17-year-old brother walked up to an officer at the scene and told him that he couldn't find his four-year-old brother.

The victim rolled out of the vehicle in front of his apartment complex, investigators said.

The victim's mother came home at 4am and became hysterical and wanted to take her own life, police reported. Once officers were able to calm her down, she was transported to the hospital.

Detectives are still interviewing the 17-year-old son. The investigation is ongoing

Family attended the Tampa Police Department on Monday but were too distraught to comment, according to Fox.

Police would not comment on how they identified the boy but said that they had no reports of missing children.

It is unclear if the family recognized the vehicle that the little boy was in at the time, a green Ford Expedition made between 2001 - 2004.

Investigators are currently looking at surveillance footage from red light cameras and nearby businesses.

The Tampa Police Department said in a statement that the child is a young, black male. Anyone with information has been asked to call Crime Stoppers 1-800-873-TIPS.
