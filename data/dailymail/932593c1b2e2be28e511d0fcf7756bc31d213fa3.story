A Chinese schoolboy has been caught defacing an ancient Egyptian temple just a few days after China's government attacked 'uncivilised' tourists for ruining the country's reputation abroad.

Chinese visitors to the Luxor Temple were outraged when they spotted the graffiti reading: 'Ding Jinhao was here' on 3,500-year-old hieroglyphics on the wall of the temple.

They posted a picture of the graffiti written in Chinese online along with comments expressing their disgust at the boy's actions.

'National embarrassment': Ding Jinhao, from Nanjing in east China's Jiangsu Province, wrote: 'Ding Jinhao was here' over hieroglyphics on the wall of an ancient Egyptian temple in Luxor

The tourist, 
surnamed Shen, said: 'It was the saddest moment during my stay in Egypt,
and I felt ashamed.

'We try to wipe out the shame with tissue, but 
it was difficult to clear it out, and we could not use water as the 
relief is a historical relic 3,500 years old.

'All of the 14 members of our tour group kept silent after seeing the sentence as we felt ashamed.'

The post prompted an online search which revealed Ding's identity, his date of birth and his school in Nanjing in east China's Jiangsu Province.

Public apology: The embarrassed parents of the schoolboy apologised to both the Chinese people and the Egyptian authorities for their son's actions

The parents of a 15-year-old Ding Jinhao
have since issued a grovelling national apology to their fellow countrymen over their son's behaviour.

They told the Nanjing-based Modern Express newspaper: 'We apologize to Egyptian authorities and Chinese people who pay attention to the incident.

'He has realized he made a mistake, and we beg your pardon, please give him a chance to correct his act.'

Many social media users in China condemned Ding for damaging the ancient relic and his parents for not educating him properly.

One said: 'Ding's uncivilized behavior disgraced Chinese people.'

It comes shortly after China introduced a
new law in April which warns against tourists committing uncivilized 
behavior but does not specify punishments.

Senior Communist Party official Wang
Yang, one of the country's four vice-prime ministers, has also warned that 
holidaymakers should be more polite, singling out talking loudly and 
spitting as poor behaviour by his fellow citizens.

Writing in the official party newspaper 
People's Daily, Mr Wang said: 'Improving the civilised quality of the 
citizens and building a good image of Chinese tourists are the 
obligations of governments at all levels and relevant agencies and 
companies.'

He said Chinese authorities should 'guide
tourists to conscientiously abide by public order and social ethics, 
respect local religious beliefs and customs, mind their speech and 
behaviour... and protect the environment'.
