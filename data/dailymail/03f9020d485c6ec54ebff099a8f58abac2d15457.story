The death of South America's liberation hero Simon Bolivar could have been hastened by arsenic and blister beetle venom, according to a fresh post-mortem to mark his 229th birthday.

The findings come after Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez ordered the 19th century revolutionary leader's bones exhumed and examined to test his theory that Bolivar was assassinated.

It was announced as Chavez and a group of schoolchildren unveiled a new 3D image of Bolivar, which a team of researchers produced based on studies of Bolivar's remains.

The socialist leader reveres Bolivar and has wrapped his left-wing reforms in the imagery and language of the region's battle to break free of colonial power Spain.

'He was a true giant of the human cause, the human battle ... this is his face,' Chavez said, sitting below two giant prints of a life-like depiction of a distinguished-looking Bolivar boasting a gold-braided uniform and prominent sideburns.

'Now we know with precision and receive with infinite intensity the luminous presence of this gaze, this living face.'

The big reveal did not offer much in the way of surprise. With his high forehead and aquiline nose, the latest image shows that contemporary artists got Bolivar's face pretty much right.

Bolivar is a figure of reverence in Latin America, where he helped to free Venezuela, Colombia, Peru and, of course, Bolivia from the Spanish colonial yoke.

But in his 13 years as Venezuelan president, Chavez has strived to turn Venezuelan-born Bolivar into a cult figure. One of his first acts on becoming president in 1999 was to push through a new constitution that changed the country's name to The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.

Since then Chavez has normally given televised speeches in front of large paintings of Bolivar, a brilliant soldier and military tactician who led independence forces against the Spanish across the region, and ordered a striking new mausoleum built for Bolivar's remains, which will be finished soon.

Venezuela's opposition accuses the president of cynically seeking to boost his popularity by linking himself to Bolivar. Right-wingers accuse Chavez of being an autocrat who carefully avoids quoting some of Bolivar's words on freedom and rights.

Chavez denies it and cites Bolivar as the inspiration for his leftist policies. He has long suggested Bolivar was poisoned by enemies in Colombia, rejecting the more common version cited by historians that he died of tuberculosis there in 1830, aged just 47.

Two years ago, amid unusual scenes of a military honour guard in white biohazard suits and face masks exhuming the remains during a pre-dawn ceremony at the National Pantheon, the president assigned a team to investigate Bolivar's death.

A year ago, it reported back that 'the Liberator' may have died of accidental poisoning - probably as a result of taking toxic medicines that were widely used at the time. They did not rule out tuberculosis.

On Tuesday, scientists said they did not find any evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis, the Miami Herald reported, but they warned that the samples were degraded and findings inconclusive.

The investigation did however turn up traces of arsenic and venom from lytta vesicatoria, or blister beetle, according to Yanuacelis Cruz, one of the medical researchers.

Both were common remedies for respiratory illnesses at the time, she added. Nevertheless, Chavez has not abandoned his theory that Bolivar was murdered by enemies loyal to the Spanish throne.

After the scientist heading the 3D image project explained how it had been created using multiple scans and the latest forensic facial reconstruction methods, Chavez said Venezuelans were jubilant to see Bolivar's 'real face' at last.

'And not just in Venezuela, but in all the countries of Latin America, the Caribbean and further afield,' he said.

'I believe Bolivar is born again every day in every one of us, in these people, in these children ... in the fight for the fatherland which never ends.'

A few blocks away from the Miraflores presidential palace, a crowd of red-clad Chavez supporters cheered and sang happy birthday as two giant canvases bearing the picture were unfurled on the face of a grand theatre.

The new picture and birth certificate are not the only events to mark Bolivar's birthday. The Venezuelan government also hopes to soon inaugurate a long-delayed new mausoleum for the independence hero.

The towering 160ft white structure in downtown Caracas is not quite yet finished, but it will soon be the resting place for the bones of Bolivar, which since 1876 had been kept along with those of another 100 Venezuelan national heroes and heroines in the adjacent National Pantheon.

Its construction has been delayed, shrouded in secrecy and alternately hailed as fit for a hero of Bolivar's historical grandeur and criticised as an exaggerated reflection of Chavez's own ego.

Its solemn black granite-floored interior is ready, but the surrounding plaza is not. Workers have been toiling day and night in recent weeks, laying patio tiles, wiring lamps, landscaping and molding concrete steps.

Critics have called the expensive memorial, thought to have cost more than Â£74million, a waste of money, while some critics have likened its sloping walls to a skate park and said it denigrates the National Pantheon.

But others believe Venezuelans deserve a towering monument.

'I don't think it's exaggerated at all,' said Isis Berroteran, a 47-year-old housewife from the west-central town of Cagua as she admired it from her car. 'The Pantheon, although spectacular, had become pretty small as the city grew.'

Elias Pino, a historian and leading expert on Bolivar, considers the mausoleum Chavez's way of deepening his own identification in people's minds with the national hero.

'The political intent is that President Hugo Chavez be proclaimed the agent of Bolivar's will and interpreter of the gospel of Bolivar,' he said.

'This monument will tie together both figures,' he said, 'and will not just be the mausoleum of Bolivar but also the entrance of President Chavez into the pantheon of patriots.'

Adulation of Bolivar transcends both sides of Venezuela's polarized pre-vote politics.

Chavez's election rival, state governor Henrique Capriles, began Tuesday by tweeting a string of inspirational Bolivar quotes from his @hcapriles account.

But in a speech later that day, he said: 'This government prefers to build a mausoleum to the Liberator rather than honor his memory,

'The best way to honor his legacy is solving the problems of the nation.'
