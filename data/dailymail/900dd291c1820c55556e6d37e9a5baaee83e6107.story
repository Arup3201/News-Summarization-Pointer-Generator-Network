It's a long way from Tasmania, where Princess Mary of Denmark grew up in a small brick house  on a quiet residential street.

Danish officials have shared pictures of the stunning Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen, where Princess Mary, Crown Prince Frederik and their four children call home.

Dating back to the 1700s, the rococo style interiors are on full display including richly decorated walls, beautiful murals and intricate crystal chandeliers.

The Amalienborg palace complex is made up of four identical buildings which stand around an octagonal courtyard.

Frederik VIII's Palace, also known as Brockdorff's Palace, is the residence of Mary, Frederik and their children Prince Christian, nine, Princess Isabella, seven and three-year-old twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine.

The other three castles that make up the complex are Christian VII's Palace, Christian VIII's Palace and Christian IX's Palace.

Frederik VIII's Palace, which was built between 1750 and 1760, was given a complete interior and exterior restoration before Mary and Frederik moved in in 2010.

The royal couple personally selected 10 Danish artists to paint modern artworks on the palace's walls and ceilings, including John Kørner and Kathrine Artebjerg.

For Christmas this year the Danish Royal family have gathered at Fredensborg Palace in the country's north.

Queen Margrethe and Prince Consort Henrik are hosting Mary and Frederick's family, along with Prince Joachim, Princess Marie and their children Henrik and Athena.

Including the Danish Queen's sisters - Queen Anne-Marie of Greece and Princess Benedikte - and extended family members there oculd be up to 50 people celebrating the festive season at the palace, Billed Bladet reported.

'It will be a really crazy circus,' Prince Joachim told Billed Bladet.

'It will be fantastic and great fun.'

While Mary may have become accustomed to spending Christmas in breathtaking palaces since she married Prince Frederik in 2004, the Australian-born princess enjoyed a much more down-to-earth upbringing in Tasmania.

Mary grew up in Taroona, a riverside suburb in the Tasmanian capital of Hobart.

Her family home was a neat and modest brick building with a small driveway and one-car garage.
