Missing: Jennifer Huston was last seen buying petrol at a 76 station in Newberg, Oregon, two miles from her home in Dundee

A husband has issued an emotional plea to his missing wife to come home as detectives hunting for the 38-year-old mother of two said they had run out of leads.

Jennifer Huston was last seen buying petrol on Thursday evening at a 76 station in Newberg, Oregon, two miles from the home she shares in Dundee with husband Kallen and their two sons, aged two and six.

Her mobile phone has been switched off for the past three days since her disappearance and her credit card has not been used.

And today her husband, Kallen, who has been trying to shelter their sons from the ordeal by telling them she is on vacation, told her: 'I love you so much and I miss you. Please come home.'

In an interview with KPTV, he described
 her disappearance as 'completely odd', adding: '[It is] completely out 
of character for her to just disappear like this.'

In a separate interview with NBC News' KGW, he went on: 'We miss her very much. My two boys really, really need her.'

Meanwhile, Mrs Huston's parents begged anyone who has any information as to her whereabouts to get in touch.

Her
 father, Bill Turner, said he and wife Deborah, were 'scared to death 
... absolutely scared to death' over the mystery of her disappearance.

'She's
 a bright, vibrant person. She's a loving mom,' Turner said. 'She looked
 like she could be a model. She's the person who everyone will gravitate
 to and will want to talk to.'

Speaking
 of his daughter's marriage, he added: 'The best way to describe the 
relationship, the way my wife describes it, is two old souls living 
together.'

He added that there were no conflicts at home, and that she would 'never leave her boys. She is an amazing mom and woman.'

Happy family: Mrs Huston's father described her marriage to Kallen as 'like two sould living together'

Mrs Huston's family had created a Facebook page to share photographs and information about her

Newberg-Dundee Police Captain Jeff 
Kosmicki says surveillance video shows Huston buying gas around 6:10 
p.m. for her dark green Lexus. She appeared to be alone.

Kosmicki says police - who have been trying to 'ping' her phone hourly for three days in a bid to get a location - have exhausted all leads.

The family created a Facebook page, Find Jennifer Huston, to share photographs and information, sparking a massive social media campaign to find Mrs Huston under the Twitter hashtag #findjenniferhuston.

'Please kiss your loved ones goodnight and sleep well. Let's get some rest and get ready to bring Jennifer home tomorrow!'

Meanwhile, Clackamas County Sheriff's department tweeted: 'Help Newberg-Dundee Police search for missing mom Jennifer Huston under suspicious circumstances.'

According to a family flier, Huston was last seen wearing black and pink Nike shoes and yoga pants. She is 5-foot-7-inches tall and has blond shoulder-length hair and blue eyes.

Anybody with information that may lead to finding Mrs Huston are urged to call their local police station immediately.
