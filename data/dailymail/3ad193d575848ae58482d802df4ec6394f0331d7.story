This is the adorable moment two affectionate beasts sealed their love with a kiss. And as the rest of these charming shots show, there are plenty more amorous animals feeling the love this Valentine's Day.

From a loving look to an affectionate nuzzle, the heart-warming images show these mushy mammals can be just as romantic as humans when it comes to celebrating the big day.

The adorable animal antics were captured by photographers from around the world and include two besotted marmots sharing a kiss in Grossglockner, Austria.
