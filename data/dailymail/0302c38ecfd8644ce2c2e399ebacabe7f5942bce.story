China has built the world's fastest supercomputer - almost twice as fast as the previous U.S. record holder - with speeds equivalent to more than 338 million normal PCs.

The Tianhe-2, which means Milky Way 2, was developed by the National University of 
Defense Technology in China's Changsha city and is capable of 
sustained computing of 33.86 petaflops per second.

That's the equivalent of 33,860 trillion calculations per second, with the average everyday computer performing around 100 million per second (although some are faster and others may be slower). 

China's supercomputer Tianhe-2 has been declared the Top500 fastest supercomputer title. It was developed by the country's National University of Defense Technology and is capable of operating at the equivalent of 33,860 trillion calculations per second

China's Tianhe-2 supercomputer, which means Milky Way 2, knocked the U.S. Department of Energy's Titan machine off the number one spot. The Chinese government sponsored the project and didn't expect the computer to be fully functional until 2015

2. Titan - U.S.

3. Sequoia - U.S.

4. K computer - Japan

5. Mira - U.S.

6. Stampede - U.S.

7. Juqueen - Germany

8. Vulcan - U.S.

9. SuperMuc - Germany

10. Tianhe-1A - China

The results were published in the TOP500 report, an official bi-annual listing of the world's faster supercomputers.

According to this list, the U.S, dominates the top ten with computers in second, third, fifth, sixth and eighth place.

Japan's K computer is in fourth spot. 

Germany's Juqueen and SuperMuc are in seventh and ninth place, while Tianhe-2's predecessor, Tianhe-1A, is tenth.

The Tianhe-1A was first in November 2010 and Japan's K computer overtook in 2011.

Each computer on the list was tested against the Linpack benchmark.

The Linpack Benchmark is used as a 'yardstick of performance' and was chosen because it is widely used across all relevant systems.

The Chinese government said it intends to install the Tianhe-2 equipment at the National Supercomputer Centre in Guangzhou, China where it will be used for 'research and education'. Supercomputers such as the Tianhe-2 are used for simulating nuclear explosions and designing jetliners

According to Linpack, the Tianhe-2 operates at 33.86 petaflop/sec - the equivalent of 33,860 trillion calculations per second.

This benchmark measures how the computers would perform in real-world environments, yet if the supercomputer was boosted to peak performance, this could theoretically increase to 54.9 petaflop/sec - 54,900 trillion calculations.

It knocked the U.S. Department of Energy's Titan machine off the number one spot, which only achieved 17.59 petaflops per second.

The Chinese government sponsored the project and didn't expect the computer to be fully functional until 2015.

It said it intends to install the 
equipment at the National Supercomputer Centre in Guangzhou where it 
will be used for 'research and education'.

'Most
 of the features of the system were developed in China, and they are 
only using Intel for the main compute part,' said TOP500 editor Jack 
Dongarra

Other supercomputers to make the top five in the twice-yearly TOP500 list include the American Titan, Sequoia and Mira computers as well as Japan's K computer in fourth spot. While Tianhe-2's predecessor, Tianhe-1A, is tenth after topping the list in November 2010

'That is, the interconnect, operating system, front-end processors and software are mainly Chinese,' said Dongarra, who toured the Tianhe-2 development facility in May.

The twice-yearly list is overseen by Hans Meuer, professor of computer science at the University of Mannheim and this current list was published to coincide with the International Supercomputing Conference in Leipzig, Germany.

Last month, technology company IBM announced it was putting its own supercomputer called Watson to work in a robot call centre.

The
 artificially intelligent computer system is taking on the role of 
customer service manager and will be called Watson Engagement Advisor.

Companies
 will be able to sign up to IBM's service and its customers can then 
ring a helpline and complain or get help from the Question Answering 
(QA) machine.

Watson has previously taken part in American 
quiz show Jeopardy, and has helped medical research teams diagnose illnesses
 in patients.

The IBM Watson Mobile Developer Challenge invited teams to design mobile apps using Watson's, pictured, cognitive computing capabilities. The 25 finalists will now submit prototypes for judging, after which only five teams will present proposals to IBM. Three winners will get access to the Watson's developer platform

Customers will be able to ask the Watson 
Engagement Advisor questions by phone, email and instant messaging. A 
smartphone app called 'Ask Watson' (pictured) is due to launch later 
this year
