Hero: Lieutenant-General Sir Adrian Paul Ghislain Carton de Wiart's Wikipedia page has become one of the most fascinating on the web

It reads more like the unbelievable exploits of the Terminator. But the remarkable heroics of Lieutenant-General Sir Adrian Paul Ghislain Carton de Wiart are entirely true.

In what many are describing as the 
best Wikipedia entry ever, the soldier's page opens with the following paragraph: 'Sir Adrian Paul Ghislain Carton de Wiart VC, KBE, CB, CMG, DSO (5 May 1880 – 5 June 1963) was a British Army officer of Belgian and Irish descent.

'He served in the Boer War, First World War, and Second World War; was shot in the face, head, stomach, ankle, leg, hip, and ear; survived a plane crash; tunnelled out of a POW camp; and bit off his own fingers when a doctor refused to amputate them.

'He later wrote that "Frankly I had enjoyed the war" when describing his service in the First World War.'

The life and times Victoria Cross-winning de Wiart were certainly far from dull.

He also escaped from a PoW camp and when he returned to London, his well-appointed house
was flattened by a German bomber and his possessions, including his 
hard-earned military medals, were destroyed.

But none of this apparent misfortune appeared to sap his morale.

The military records of this extraordinary soldier were published online for the first time last November by genealogy website Genes Reunited.

The new details prompted numerous revisions of his Wikipedia entry, transforming it into what must be one of the most unique on the website.

Indeed, De Wiert's name has now travelled around the globe as many have taken to Twitter to label his page 'the best entry on Wikipedia'.

Another wrote: 'The rumours are true - Adrian Carton de Wiart's bio is the most manly bio ever.'

Born in 1880 to a wealthy Belgian family, he studied law at Oxford but in 1899 quit university and went to South Africa.

Giving a false name and age, he enlisted in the British Army and fought in the Second Boer War.

He
was wounded in the stomach and groin and invalided home. In 1901, he 
became an officer in the 4th Royal Dragoon Guards. In the First World 
War he fought with the Army’s ‘Camel Corps’ in British Somaliland, in 
east Africa, tackling an uprising by supporters of Mohammed bin 
Abdullah, dubbed the ‘Mad Mullah’.

In
an attack on an enemy fort he was shot in the face and lost his left 
eye – forcing him to wear a black patch for the rest of his life. His 
gallantry earned him the DSO.

He
then went to the bloody trenches of the Western Front to command 
infantry battalions. In 1915 he lost his left hand after being hit by 
shrapnel – but not before he tore off some damaged fingers by himself.

In the Battle of the Somme he was shot in the skull and ankle, but won the VC, the country’s most acclaimed military honour.

Records describes how, 
commanding the 8th Battalion the Gloucestershire Regiment at La 
Boiselle, he displayed ‘dauntless courage’ in a ‘fire barrage of the 
most intense nature’. In total he was wounded in battle eight times and 
was mentioned in dispatches on six occasions.

In
his autobiography Happy Odyssey, he wrote of the 1914-18 conflict: 
‘Frankly, I enjoyed the war; it had given me many bad moments, lots of 
good ones, plenty of excitement and with everything found for us.’

Between the wars, he served on the British Military Mission in Poland, returning home after the Nazi invasion in 1939.

In
1940, aged 60, he led an operation to take the Norwegian city of 
Trondheim to halt the German advance but the mission failed when supply 
lines collapsed.

In 
1941, on his way to lead the British Military Mission in Yugoslavia, his
plane crashed into the sea a mile off the coast of Libya, an Italian 
colony. He swam ashore but was captured and sent to a PoW camp in Italy.

He made five escape 
attempts, once eluding capture for eight days even though he was 
conspicuous with an eyepatch and did not speak Italian. Released in 
1943, Winston Churchill sent him as his special representative to China.
He retired in 1947 and died in 1963, aged 83.
