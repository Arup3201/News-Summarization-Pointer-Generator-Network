The body of a British woman who collapsed and died in Austria following a trip to Nigeria is being tested for the deadly Ebola virus, authorities have confirmed.

The unnamed 48-year-old was found dead in the flat she owned in the town of Vomp, in the Tyrol, on Saturday after completing her journey home from the West African nation, which included a stop-over in Germany.

Amid growing fears over a possible spread of the disease beyond West Africa, it was revealed today that the corpse of a Nigerian woman who died shortly after touching down in United Arab Emirates 
capital Abu Dhabi yesterday was also being tested for Ebola.

Austrian officials today confirmed that they have implemented emergency measures and sent a blood and urine sample to the Centre for Tropical Diseases in Hamburg, Germany, after the doctor who attended the scene gave the cause of death as a viral infection.

Concern: The unnamed 48-year-old was found dead in the flat she owned in the town of Vomp (pictured), in the Tyrol, on Saturday after completing her journey home from the West African nation, which included a stop-over in Germany

Police were alerted to the fact that there might be a problem when a relative had contacted them to say they could not contact the woman.

If confirmed, it would be the first case of the virus in Europe.

However, Franz Katzgraber, head of the regional health board, said the risk that the woman had died from the Ebola virus was 'extremely low.'

'We have decided to get a diagnosis for exclusion of  ebola,' he said. 

Spreading: The Ebola virus has killed more than 1,000 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia since the outbreak began in March, and four people have died in Nigeria since it was brought to Lagos (pictured) by a Liberian man on July 20

'The 48-year-old recently entered Germany from Nigeria and we could not determine the history of the deceased.'

Her apartment has been sealed and officers who found the body have undergone medical counselling and inspection.

The Ebola outbreak in 
West Africa was first reported in March, and has rapidly become the 
deadliest occurrence of the disease since its discovery in 1976.

More than 2,000 people have died of the virus, prompting the World Health Organisation (WHO) to declare an International Public Health Emergency.

'All possible precautions have been taken,' according to the Health Ministry.  'All persons who had been with the corpse in Tyrol would have worn protective clothing.

He confirmed that it was nevertheless vital to implement emergency measures even when there was just a suspicion, adding that even if the woman did turn out to have died from Ebola, it was 
unlikely to have passed on to anyone else as the infection is 
only transmitted through direct contact with blood or other bodily fluids of 
an infected person.

He said that in Nigeria so far only one person has died from the virus and the risk of catching it from a trip there was low, and it was much more likely if somebody had come in from Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone.

The woman's home has in the meantime been sealed off and emergency services staff including medics who found the body have been quarantined.

Although a British citizen, the woman 
appears to have had a property in Austria although it was not explained 
whether it was a holiday home or whether she lived in the Alpine 
Republic.

It comes hours after a Nigerian woman who arrived on a flight to the United Arab Emirates 
capital of Abu Dhabi and later died in the city may have been infected 
with the Ebola virus, said health officials.

The health authority in the emirate said in a statement carried by the 
Emirati state news agency WAM on Sunday evening that the 35-year-old 
woman was traveling from Nigeria to India for treatment of advanced 
metastatic cancer.

Her health deteriorated while in transit at Abu Dhabi International 
Airport and as medics were trying to resuscitate her, they found signs 
that suggested a possible Ebola virus infection.

It comes as Nigeria confirmed 12 more cases of the Ebola virus, up from 10 at last week's count, of which five have almost fully recovered, the Health Ministry said on Monday.

It said in a statement that 189 people in Lagos and six others in the southeastern city of Enugu were under surveillance. The death toll remains four, it said.

A doctor who had recovered had been discharged from hospital, the ministry said.

The Ebola virus has killed more than 1,000 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia since the outbreak began in March, and four people have died in Nigeria since it was brought to Lagos by a Liberian man on July 20.

'Patients under treatment have now been moved to the new 40 bed capacity isolation ward provided by the Lagos state government,' the Health Ministry statement said.

It added that experimental drugs were in the process of being cleared for the treatment of Ebola, although one, nano silver, had been rejected because it did not meet requirements.

What is Ebola virus disease?

Ebola
 is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 per 
cent.The illness affects humans as well as primates, including monkeys, 
gorillas and chimpanzees.

How do people become infected with the virus?

Ebola is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals.

In
 Africa infection in humans has happened as a result of contact with 
chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and 
porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest.

Once
 a person becomes infected, the virus can spread through contact with a 
sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen. A person can also 
become infected if broken skin comes into contact with a victim's soiled
 clothing, bed linen or used needles.

Men
 who have recovered from the disease, can still spread the virus to 
their partner through their semen for seven weeks after recovery.

Who is most at risk?

Those at risk during an outbreak include:

What are the typical signs and symptoms?

Sudden
 onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore 
throat. That is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney 
and liver function and internal and external bleeding.

The incubation period is between two and 21 days. A person will become contagious once they start to show symptoms.

When should you seek medical care?

If
 a person is in an area affected by the outbreak, or has been in contact
 with a person known or suspected to have Ebola, they should seek 
medical help immediately.

What is the treatment?

Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. They need intravenous fluids to rehydrate them.

But
 there is currently no specific treatment for the disease. Some patients
 will recover with the appropriate care.Can Ebola be prevented?

Currently there is no licensed vaccine for Ebola. Several are being tested but are not available for clinical use.

Is it safe to travel to affected areas?

The
 World Health Organisation reviews the public health situation 
regularly, and recommends travel or trade restrictions if necessary. The
 risk of infection for travellers is very low since person-to-person 
transmission results from direct contact with bodily fluids of victims.
