Jose Mourinho has ruled out luring Lionel Messi to Stamford Bridge because of the restraints imposed by UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations.

Mourinho was speaking to Clare Balding for a BT Sport Christmas Day special, Clare Balding Meets, which includes a two-part interview that also features former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson.

When asked if there was a possibility of signing arguably the world's greatest player, the Chelsea manager said: 'No, I have no chance of that.

'Because at this moment there is financial fair play and with the financial fair play we have to follow certain rules, certain numbers and we obviously have no conditions to buy, as you say a 'super amazing player' paid with 'super amazing numbers' that Chelsea at this moment we cannot do.'

That is likely to disappoint Blues midfielder Cesc Fabregas who previously said that he 'would love' his close friend and former team-mate Messi to join him in west London. 

The pair played together as youngsters before being reunited at the Nou Camp following Fabregas' transfer from Arsenal in 2011.

When asked if he thinks Messi should join him in west London, Fabregas told Radio Marca: 'I wish! Why not? I'd love that to happen. I'd be all for it.

'As a Barca man, I believe that Messi deserves to retire there for all that he has given the club.

'He is a legend that has changed Barca's history. But, as his team-mate and friend, without doubt I'd love to have Leo by my side. 

Sir Alex Ferguson was also speaking to Claire Balding as part of the Christmas Day double-bill

Meanwhile, as part of the interview special, Ferguson joked that he was envious of his friend and and former rival Mourinho.

'It is unfair really. He’s good looking, he’s got that sort of George Clooney bit in his hair now,' Ferguson commented. 'But I think he is a great example, he can speak five languages or whatever he can.

'He has got a determination, he wants to be a coach,' Ferguson added.

'He never played the game, by the way – you tell me how many presidents would give a manager a job who has never played the game? None. But he has done it.'

Jose Mourinho was speaking to Clare Balding as part of a BT Sport Christmas Day double-bill of ‘Clare Balding Meets’ which features exclusive interviews with Mourinho and Sir Alex Ferguson. Watch the full interviews on BT Sport 1 from 3.30pm on December 25th.
