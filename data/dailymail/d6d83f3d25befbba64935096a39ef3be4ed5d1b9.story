Torquay United mascot Gilbert the Gull reportedly challenged his own supporters to a fight after calling them a 'bunch of c****'.

The  argument broke out after visitors Grimsby Town scored their third against Torquay 20 minutes from the end during the 3-2 defeat at Plainmoor on Saturday.

Fans took to the official website to tell of the mascot's alleged threatening behaviour afterwards.

Steve Jegat denies swearing at Torquay supporters

'We all thought he was having a laugh, but then he called us a "bunch of c****" and after a few words exchanged he waddled off back to the Family Stand.

'At the end of the game, Gilbert came over again and in front of us on the pitch, he gave the "come on, then" body language towards us and wouldn't stop until hiding behind the stewards and again waddling off as we moved towards the exits.

'I (and many others) complained to the stewards about this and I personally spoke to Andrew Candy about this issue and he will be having a word. We have the worst mascot in football.'

Another supporter added: 'The mascot was, and no doubt about it, offering fans on to the pitch for a fight.

'What would have happened to the club if 10 or more decided to take up the mascots offer and jumped over the wall and on to the pitch?'

The man inside the costume, however, Steve Jegat, insists he did not swear or gesture to fans at the Conference match.

'Basically after Grimsby scored their third goal I went over and said "where’s the drummer gone?" and ended up getting a load of abuse.

'The fans on that side had just given up. But I didn’t swear like they were trying to say.

'I went and told the stewards I’m more welcome at the away end. I even had a load of abuse on Gilbert’s Facebook page when I got home.' 

Torquay  have cleared him to resume his duties at Plainmoor but banned him from the Popside home stand

Torquay United chief executive Andrew Candy confirmed the club were investigating the incident.

Jegat, however, has been cleared to continue acting as mascot at Plainmoor but the dad-of-two has been banned from the Popside home stand to avoid further trouble.

'There was an exchange of views between Gilbert and the fans in the Popside,' the chief executive said. 'Gilbert was trying to generate some support and get the fans behind the team but it appears that there was a small altercation with the fans.

'There was no malicious intent in what was said but things were said that, in hindsight, should not have been.

'Gilbert has been spoken to and been told that this should not have happened and that this will not happen in the future.'
