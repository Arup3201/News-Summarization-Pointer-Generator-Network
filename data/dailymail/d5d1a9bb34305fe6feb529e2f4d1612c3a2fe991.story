A healthy baby gorilla weighing five pounds has been born at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Ohio.

The unnamed young male was born May 23, 2013 at 3:22 a.m. and is the first offspring for parents Oliver and Kambera.

Unfortunately new mom Kambera's maternal skills are currently lacking and so animal care experts are raising the baby in an environment that provides around-the-clock neonatal care.

The expert are however staying close to the mom, with the hope of reuniting the pair.

The zoo has said there are several other female gorillas at the zoo who could act as a surrogate mother if needed.

Staff said they didn't known when visitors would be able to see the baby.

Kambera was born at the Columbus Zoo in 1999, she was delivered through one of the first successful caesarean sections ever performed on a gorilla.

Her own mother was unable to care for her after she was born. Staff at the zoo raised her until she was about five months old, when a surrogate took over.Â

New dad Oliver is deaf after losing his hearing when he was young. The 24-year-old arrived at the Columbus Zoo in 2009. His move to the zoo brought was his first socialization with other gorillas since he was six years old.

'The birth of a gorilla baby, actually any baby, is always a momentous event,' Tom Stalf, president and CEO of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium told ABC5.

'But what really touches our hearts is that Oliver, who came here after living by himself for so many years, has produced a beautiful baby boy.'

There have been 31 gorillas born at the Columbus zoo, including Colo in 1956. That female western lowland gorilla is believed to be the oldest gorilla in any zoo.
