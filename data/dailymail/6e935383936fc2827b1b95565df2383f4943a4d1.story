A New York woman is going after her millionaire husband for everything he's got after allegedly catching him cheating on her and then shutting her out of their Long Island country club membership.

Sheri Astrachen is suing her husband, real estate executive Matthew Astrachen, for defamation in the Manhattan Supreme Court and is seeking $20 million in damages.

She claims he humiliated her at the Old Westbury Golf & Country Club, which has a rule to publicly list the names of people with unpaid bills on notices in the locker rooms and did so with her.

'This has had the intended effect of falsely making it appear to the Old Westbury Club and its constituent members, who are also neighbors and friends of [Sheri], that [she] is without the economic resources and assets to maintain pay for membership privileges,' court papers obtained by The New York Post said.

Matthew Astrachen is the vice president of commercial real estate firm JLL (Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated) and earns $4 million a year.

He and Sheri have been married for 18 years and have three daughters.

However, according to The Post, Sheri caught her husband cheating with 'one or more sales girls in New York City shops'.

She then kicked him out of their $4.7 million Old Westbury home.

The pair first filed for divorce last year but it is yet to be finalized. 

The lawsuit claims Matthew Astrachen fought back by not paying the country club bill and cancelling some of his wife's credit cards.

The move was 'economic and emotional warfare', the suit said.

Sheri Astrachen maintains that she should be able to enjoy the same luxuries she did when they were married even though they are now estranged.

Among the luxuries are a $150,000 Maserati, $100,000 in yearly vacations, their home, golf-club membership, $150,000 for a summer rental in the Hamptons, three housekeepers and nannies, and leases on a S550 Mercedes and Cadillac Escalade.

Mr Astrachen's lawyer, Steven Schlesinger, told The Post that the lawsuit was frivolous. 

'We don’t comment on frivolous litigation except to say that we intend to move to have the lawyer sanctioned,' he said.
