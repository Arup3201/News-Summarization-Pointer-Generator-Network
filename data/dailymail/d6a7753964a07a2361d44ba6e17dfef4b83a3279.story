Long-hailed as a role model to Britain, France’s much-lauded high speed TGV trains are ‘running out of steam’ according to a damning report by French financial watchdogs.

Some 33 years after the launch of the first TGV - Train à Grande Vitesse or ‘high speed train’ - 40 per cent of the trains still travel on conventional track rather than the specially built high-speed lines.

Watchdogs say the system often fails to meet its key stated aims on what is described as an ‘incoherent’ network.

These are ‘to link large population centres, within one and a half to three hours, few or no intermediate stops, a frequent service, a high user rate and good connections to other forms of transport’.

The report will make alarming reading for the UK Government on the day it announced its own ambitious new plans for an East to West high speed rail – dubbed HS3 – in addition to the already controversial planned HS2.

France’s Audit Office  blamed local authorities for pressuring the state to allow the TGV to pass through their towns, creating an ‘incoherent’ network.

As a result, there are now a total 230 TGV stations across France, many on lines which are loss-making for the state-run SNCF company.

In the UK cities like Stoke and Liverpool have also been pressing to be part of Britain’s high speed network, with Sheffield wanting a stop in the city centre rather than at the Meadowhall out-of-town shopping centre.

France’s Audit Office highlighted a steady drop in TGV profitability since 2008. Decision-making processes are only ‘partly rational’ in the cases of the Tours-Bordeaux line, which is due to open in 2017 at an estimated cost of £7billion.

£7billion is also the mooted cost of the Northern HS3 route from Liverpool to Hull via Manchester and Leeds.

French auditors recommended a gradual reduction in the number of TGV stops, improved planning and greater transparency with passenger statistics.

France’s state-owned rail operator SNCF is already considering closing some stations.

But a French business website says the rail company is also considering increasing first class fares and putting restrictions on ticket refunds and exchanges in standard class, and axing the buffet car, in a bid to restore profitability.

The French rail users’ association vice-chairman Jean Lenoir, told Le Parisien on Sunday that axing high speed stations was “going in the wrong direction’ and would complicate things for the traveller’.

It would also be ‘scandalous’ if SNCF changed its ticket policy and scrapped the buffet cars, he said.
