Donning woolly hats, warm jackets and gloves, thousands of runners took to the streets of New York  today for the city's 2014 marathon.

Around 50,000 people braved strong winds and low temperatures to compete in the 26.2 mile race, which started on Staten Island this morning.

Some wore wacky outfits to help them get into the spirit of the event, dressing as superheroes, animals and even a 'coatman' with a tray of drinks.

Before the race, runners were spotted shielding themselves from 40mph winds with blankets and sheets of foil at the staging area in Fort Wadsworth.

Men's winner: In the men's race, Wilson Kipsang, also of Kenya, achieved first place, with a time of two hours, 10 minutes and 59 seconds

But during the high-profile event, many decided to shed their winter accessories as the sun beamed down and they worked up a heavy sweat.

The marathon, covering New York City's five boroughs, saw the professional women's race kick off at 9.10am, followed by the men's 35 minutes later.

Wave two runners set off at around 10:05am, wave three began at 10:30am and final set of runners, wave four, headed out at 10.55am.

Runners included tennis star Caroline Wozniacki (center), of Denmark, who was seen grinning after completing the race in three hours, 26 minutes and 33 seconds. Earlier in the day, she had tweeted a photo of herself on Staten Island, with the caption: 'Ready or not... Here I come. Few min left!'

Her success comes in the same month she was due to marry professional golfer Rory McIlroy, to whom she became engaged on New Year's Eve 2013 in Sydney. On May 21 it was announced that McIllroy had called off the engagement - just days after they sent out invitations to the November wedding.

Wozniacki was met at the finish line by fellow tennis star and close friend Serena Williams, who beat her last Saturday in the WTA Finals in Singapore.

Late morning, it was announced that Mary Keitany, of Kenya, had won the women's title, with an unofficial time of two hours, 25 minutes and seven seconds.

She overtook countrywoman Jemima Sumgong with about a half-mile to go in her first marathon since 2012 after the birth of her second child.

Her finish time - if confirmed - was three seconds ahead of Sumgong, which would match the closest finish in the history of the women's race.

It was redemption in New York for 32-year-old Keitany, who raced out to a big lead in 2011 only to be passed and settle for third. Sumgong is still seeking her first major marathon title. She was also second in Boston in 2012 and in Chicago in 2013.

In the men's race, Wilson Kipsang, also from Kenya, achieved first place, with an unofficial time of two hours, 10 minutes and 59 seconds.

The former world-record holder has now won in Berlin, London and New York in just over 13 months.
