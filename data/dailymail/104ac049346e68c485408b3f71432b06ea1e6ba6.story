Pharrell Williams, one of the biggest black figures in the music industry, has spoken out about the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, saying he is 'troubled' a grand jury decided not to indict  the white police officer responsible.

But the 'Happy' singer also sparked heated debate  by calling Brown's behavior leading up to his August 9 death 'bully-ish'.

Before he was shot dead, Brown was caught on surveillance camera stealing a handful of cigarillos from a convenience store in Ferguson, Missouri, and intimidating the shop owner. 

While Pharrell says that was no excuse for Officer Darren Wilson to use lethal force against the unarmed teen, he thinks Brown's actions are being overlooking in the national discussion about the tragedy.  

'It looked very bully-ish; that in itself I had a problem with,' Pharrell told Ebony magazine. 'Not with the kid, but with whatever happened in his life for him to arrive at a place where that behavior is OK. Why aren't we talking about that?'

Intimidating: Police released this surveillance camera footage, reportedly showing Michael Brown grabbing a convenience store owner shortly before he was stopped by Officer Darren Wilson and eventually shot dead

'The boy was walking in the middle of the street when the police supposedly told him to “get the f*** on the sidewalk.” If you don’t listen to that, after just having pushed a storeowner, you’re asking for trouble,' he added.

However, Pharrell said that Brown's behavior in the convenience store did not warrant his death, and that he believes Officer Wilson should have been charged in the death.  

After the story was published on Tuesday, Twitter was flooded with comments calling out Pharrell's interview. 

One Twitter user said: 'Mike Brown was a bully says Pharrell Williams. So do we get a pass to shoot bullies in society? Way to go Pharrell.'

This isn't the first time that singer has started controversy over his opinions on race issues.

In an interview with Oprah last year, Pharrell angered some when he said 'the new black doesn't blame others races for our issues'.

Pharrell seemed hesitant to talk about race in the interview with the African-American monthly, saying: 'I don’t talk about race since it takes a very open mind to hear my view, because my view is the sky view. But I’m very troubled by what happened in Ferguson, Missouri.'

However, he felt the need to weigh in on the current situation in the predominantly-black St Louis suburb, believing 'the hangover from Ferguson is going to be a long one, worse than Trayvon Martin'. 

No consequences: In the same interview with Ebony magazine, Pharrell said he was troubled that the man responsible for Brown's death, Officer Darren Wilson (pictured), will not face trial for the shooting 

Anger: The grand jury decision not to indict Wilson on any charges related to Brown's death sparked violence between protesters and police in Ferguson, Missouri Monday night 

Trayvon Martin was another unarmed black teen, 17, who was shot dead two years ago near to where he lived in Sanford, Florida, by a man who thought he was a burglar. 

Shooter George Zimmerman was controversially acquitted on any charges in the teen's death.

While his comments sparked a debate online, it's clear that Pharrell feels a strong connection to the current situation in Ferguson, Missouri, where protesters turned violent after hearing the grand jury's decision Monday night.

Following the decision, Pharrell tweeted: 'I'm heartbroken over the news of no indictment in Ferguson. Let's all pray for peace'. 

And on Monday night's episode of The Voice, he made the contestants he was mentoring switch out the lyrics in 'What a Beautiful World' with the line 'We need justice to unfurl'.

He says he still believes racism exists, and that the situation in Ferguson may have been calmer if the president went there to show his support. 

'He didn’t have to go and take a side; all he needed to do was show his presence and everybody would have straightened up. But he didn’t go. I won’t fault him. He’s a man with a lot of weight on his shoulders, but I personally would have gone because being a “man of the people” means you’re right there with them in it. Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. led by example.'

'The new black': Pharrell previously caused controversy during an interview with Oprah earlier this year. In the interview he said 'the new black doesn't blame others races for our issues'

Pharrell also made the strange decision to praise Bill Cosby during the interview, for the comedian's history preaching tough love to black youth. Cosby is currently under fire after several women have come forward to accuse the The Cosby Show star of rape.

'I agree with him. When Cosby said it back then, I understood; I got it. Listen, we have to look at ourselves and take action for ourselves. Cosby can talk that talk because he created Fat Albert, he tried to buy NBC, he portrayed a doctor on The Cosby Show and had all of us wearing Coogi sweaters. You’ve got to respect him,' Pharrell said.
