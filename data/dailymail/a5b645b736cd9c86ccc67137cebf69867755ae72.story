Government borrowing will be £45billion less than expected over the next few years, according to a report out today.

The deficit in 2013-14 will be £8billion to £9billion less than the £119.8billion pencilled in by the Chancellor at the Budget in March, it says.

After that borrowing will be around £9billion lower than expected every year up to 2017-18 thanks to stronger economic growth, the Ernst & Young Item Club has said.

Buoyant: The report from the Ernst & Young Item Club will come as a boost to Chancellor George Osborne

The forecast from the leading economic think-tank will come as a boost to George Osborne ahead of the Autumn Statement on December 4, when he will be able to claim that the outlook is improving.

The Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent Treasury watchdog, is expected to back up his claims with vastly improved forecasts for the economy and the public finances.

The IMF last week raised its UK growth forecasts for 2013 to 1.4 per cent – double the rate it was expecting in April, when it warned the Chancellor was ‘playing with fire’ be pressing ahead with his austerity plan.

In today’s report, the Item Club also raises its growth forecast for this year from 1.1 per cent to 1.4 per cent and for next year from 2.2 per cent to 2.4 per cent.

Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to Item, said: ‘The recovery in the UK now appears to be firmly entrenched.’

He said it has resulted in ‘a marked improvement in the UK’s public finances’.

‘The OBR is likely to upgrade its growth forecast and revise down the borrowing forecast in the upcoming Autumn Statement at the end of the year,’ added Mr Spencer.

Road to recovery: The report also predicted that unemployment would fall from 7.7 per cent to 7 per cent

Borrowing hit a record £157.9billion in 2009-10 under Labour, but fell to £115.7billion last year under the Coalition.

However, progress has been far slower than expected due to sluggish economic growth.

The Item Club now expects growth to pick up to 2.6 per cent in 2015 before easing back to 2.5 per cent in 2017 and 2018.

It puts much of the improved outlook down to the recovering housing market – but plays down fears of a new property bubble driven by state-backed schemes such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy.

The recovery will bring unemployment down from its current level of 7.7 per cent to 7 per cent, or 2.28million, in early 2015, according to the report.

David Cameron will today pledge new action to crack down on late payments which can drive small businesses to the brink of financial ruin.

Some 85 per cent of small and medium-sized firms say they have had to grapple with late payment from contractors.

The Prime Minister said: ‘I am determined to make Britain the best place to start, grow and do business and to back people who want to work and hard and get on.’
