This is the start of what could be the biggest year in the history of rugby union in this country. It’s time for England to deliver and they have the opportunity of their lives.

No what ifs, no buts, no maybes. No excuses.

There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that England possess good enough players to win the World Cup. 

England are blessed with talent at No 10 including Bath's George Ford (left) and Sale's Danny Cipriani 

For the first time since 2003 I look at the squad and see players who would be a match for some of the greats from that World Cup winning side. The likes of Alex Corbisiero, Dylan Hartley, Dan Cole, Courtney Lawes, George Ford, Danny Cipriani, Anthony Watson and Christian Wade excite me for the months ahead.

Our mantra in 2003 was ‘how do you want to be remembered?’ and this should guide this Six Nations campaign too. I want to see Stuart Lancaster really take hold of this squad now and stamp his authority on this England side.

I want to see him leading from the front and not being afraid to be confrontational and edgy. Players will take their lead from him. Things have felt a little bit cosy around this England squad for too long — other nations think we are the nice guys of international rugby: talented and difficult to beat no doubt but nice all the same. This is not the history or DNA of English rugby and it needs to end with tonight’s match against Wales in Cardiff.

Yes, there are injuries. But England have more players available to them than any other rugby nation.The quality of the players Lancaster can call on despite the injury list is outstanding.

The pack will provide the possession, the question is: can England turn that possession into points?

The answer to that will be provided by England’s coaches who must deliver to the team a clear vision of how to break sides down. The honeymoon period has long been over for Stuart Lancaster and his coaching team but since leaving to tour New Zealand last summer we have seen little evidence of a fluid, clever attacking blueprint.

Pressure rose in the autumn after winning just two of their four matches and Lancaster’s team will continue to be under the spotlight in this tournament because they’ve had enough time together now to articulate their attacking vision to the players.

I hope Lancaster has been ramping up the pressure on his team, telling them that it is all about now. They must win these big matches. We saw last year when England lost to France just how hard it is to recover. If England are to stand a chance of winning the World Cup they have to treat these games as knockout games and go to places like Cardiff and Dublin and win with confidence. 

England have lacked a fluid, attacking game plan since the three-Test summer tour of New Zealand in 2014 

In 2003 we won the Grand Slam and we actively sought to ratchet up the pressure on the players because they needed to learn how to operate under that pressure.

The result was a battle-hardended group who knew how to win away from home. There was no talk of next week or the next tournament. It was about the now. One shot, no excuses.

We should not forget that England will face Wales at the World Cup in a crucial group game. There’s no doubt that you want to go into that match knowing you have the beating of your opposition. But, equally, no England player should be looking beyond the game tonight.

Heading into the Six Nations in 2003 we didn’t talk about the World Cup. As a team we told ourselves that the Six Nations was everything and, after near-misses, we desperately wanted that Grand Slam. But even within this we remained focused that winning the next game was all that mattered.

It sounds simplistic, but I just kept thinking ‘if we keep winning the next game, one day we’ll end up in the World Cup final.’

As a coaching team you need to consider the future and direction of the team, and to that point we began implementing a more controlling gameplan geared towards knockout rugby. In truth, with the exception of the final game against Ireland, we didn’t play spectacularly well in that tournament.

But we left the Six Nations knowing we had control of our game. We beat Scotland 40-9 in our fourth match on a beautiful day at Twickenham — it was the first time Jason Robinson, Josh Lewsey and Ben Cohen played together in the back three. We played OK but not as well as the scoreline might suggest and the players’ response afterwards was understated.

They were obviously delighted and the atmosphere in the room was great but it was treated just like a job well done, which it was. I remember the feeling of standing in the dressing room after the game with Phil Larder and Andy Robinson before the players came back in, almost chuckling.

It is an amazing thing when you can feel things going right, the energy and momentum it gives you is priceless. The same can happen to this England side: by the end of the tournament they will either look like a team capable of winning a World Cup or a team with so many questions unanswered.

More importantly, they will feel it among themselves. I do not like to suggest that success will be five wins out of five or four wins out of five. The extent of success from the Six Nations, especially in a World Cup year, will be how they feel. Do they truly feel as though they have the game to beat anybody, or turn any situation they face into a victory?

This current niceness in the England set-up goes right through the RFU, typified by Lancaster and his coaching team being given six-year contracts last year. It was an error to go public and indicated a complete lack of understanding of professional sport by the RFU’s chief executive Ian Ritchie.

Winning is about putting coaches and players under pressure, not the opposite. You just don’t give those sort of contracts in professional sport so close to such an important tournament. Six-year contracts allow space for excuses and for the coach of the England side to start thinking about development rather than winning.

It is a massive mistake. 

Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury will be missed but Dave Attwood (centre) is a superb replacement 

This is Stuart Lancaster’s World Cup year. Not 2019. I would like to see him start rattling the other coaches in this tournament because as long as they’re saying he’s doing a good job it means they want him to stay.

There is a high calibre of coaches in this Six Nations. Joe Schmidt of Ireland is the outstanding one, followed by Wales’ Warren Gatland and Vern Cotter of Scotland. All three have proven track records and have instilled a clear gameplan and style into their sides. Lancaster and France’s Philippe Saint-Andre are next in line.

I look forward to revisiting this discussion after the Six Nations, with Lancaster having really gone toe-to-toe and left a significant mark on his rivals in Cardiff and Dublin.

Despite injuries, our pack will continue to set a platform and succeed at the set-piece. It’s a shame Lawes and Joe Launchbury aren’t available through injury but I’m a huge fan of Dave Attwood and I think he can bring that nasty, snarling edge that every great pack needs. Cole, Hartley and Joe Marler is a brilliant front row — just three of the world-class players in our pack that also includes James Haskell and Chris Robshaw.

This is the most exciting England team of Lancaster’s tenure. Sometimes an injury list creates clarity and with Owen Farrell and Brad Barritt sidelined, some decisions have been taken out of Lancaster’s hands. He’s been forced into a more exciting back line. I can’t wait to see Ford link up with Jonathan Joseph and I’m delighted to see Cipriani involved.

Lancaster and his staff, along with the clubs, deserve credit for the progression and form a number of players are enjoying. Let’s see if they can thrill us on Friday night.
