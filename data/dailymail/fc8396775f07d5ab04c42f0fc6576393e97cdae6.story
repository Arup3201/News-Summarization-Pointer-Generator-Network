The lead singer of the popular British band McFly decided it was time to have a new very young member. To welcome his baby into the world he decided to create a time lapse of his wife's pregnancy to the tune of an original song.

'We took photos every day through the 9 months of our pregnancy, this is the result (plus a little song I wrote called "Something New")' writes Tom Fletcher on his Youtube on which he posted the video 'From Bump to Buzz'  of his gradually growing wife Giovanna who gave birth on Thursday.

The viral video from Bump to Buzz has over 1 million views, and one of those viewers, Buzz Michelangelo Fletcher, is fresh from the womb.

On Thursday the couple welcomed into the world and shared the news on their respective Twitter accounts.

'Sorry for my twitter silence over the last 24hrs, I’ve been far too busy cuddling my son… :)' said Tom Fletcher.

'THRILLED to announce the safe arrival of our little BOY! Born last night at 7pm. I can’t stop staring at and kissing him! I’m in love! Xxx' wrote his wife Giovanna.

And to really let his fans know what it's like to have a baby he wrote, 'And he’s on his 3rd nappy. Full of poop, that’s my boy!'

'And yes I'm being completely serious, my son is called Buzz :D,' he wrote to fans who were commenting on his child's new title.

Fletcher is no stranger to writing original songs for his beloved wife Giovanna. Some may remember the wedding speech he wrote to Giovanna on their special day in May of 2012. That video has 11,420,979 views.

Fletcher then decided to write a little tune for their birth announcement and decided to make the song writing for important life moments a tradition.

Parentdish.com reports that Tom and Giovanna met when they were both teenagers at the Sylvia Young Theater School where they were both students.

The high school sweethearts are now internationally adored and will continue to grow for all the world to see.
