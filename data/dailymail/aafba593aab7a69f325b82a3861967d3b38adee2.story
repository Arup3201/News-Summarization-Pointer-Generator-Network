With fields bathed in golden light and mist rising through the trees, these glorious scenes show that autumn is well and truly on its way.

The leaves are already starting to change colour, with horse chestnuts and acorns ripening. 

Experts say last month’s cold weather has tricked Mother Nature into starting autumn early  despite the warm, summery conditions that arrived yesterday. 

A morning mist brought spectacular views to Chatsworth Park, Derbyshire, shrouding the home of the Duke of Devonshire. But as the day progressed, parts of the South basked in temperatures of 23C (73F).

IIn the 
Lake District, cattle were silhouetted against a sunset near Oxenholme 
on Saturday, while shafts of light pierced the clouds at Wrynose Pass. Apple growers say the harvest has started three weeks early, with an excellent crop predicted.

Adrian
 Barlow, of English Apples & Pears, said varieties such as Discovery
 had already started to reach the shelves of independent retailers. 
‘Quality is extremely good,’ he added. ‘The apples will have great 
crunchiness, lots of taste and a good size.’ 

Swifts
 have been seen migrating south as they sense the change in the seasons.
 Dr Kate Lewthwaite, of the Woodland Trust, said: ‘Autumn is beginning 
to make itself felt across the UK.’

Forecasters
 expect the sunshine to continue, with the mercury  reaching up to 24C 
(75F) on Friday. Mark Wilson, of the Met Office, said: ‘Temperatures are
 well above average and will feel warm for the time of year.’

And, according
 to the Met Office, we could even be in for an Indian summer, with a 35 
per cent chance the next three months will bring above-average 
temperatures. By contrast, there is only a 15 per cent probability they 
will be colder than normal.

The overall average temperature for September is a significantly lower 16C (61F) or 17C (63F).

bringing more settled conditions, and also slightly warmer conditions as
 well.'

‘We had a pretty cool August, temperatures in places below average for the last couple of weeks. So it looks like it’s warming up as we go into the middle of the week.

‘It’s not going to be wall-to-wall sunshine but where there are sunny spells it’s going to feel pretty warm.

‘Generally temperatures are rising day on day from today. By Thursday or Friday, we could see 24C or 25C in the sunny spells in the south.’

She added: ‘It’s not a negative picture for the north by any stretch.’ Scotland and the North of England could see 20C (68F) or 21C (70F) temperatures.
