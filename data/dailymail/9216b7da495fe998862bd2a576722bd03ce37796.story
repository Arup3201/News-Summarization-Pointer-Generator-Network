An Australian athlete has been arrested during a bust-up at the Commonwealth Games athletes' village.

A 29-year-old male, who has not been named, has been charged with assault after the incident on Wednesday at around 6am.

He is being held in custody and will appear in Glasgow Sheriff Court on Friday.

The athlete is alleged to be weightlifter Francois Etoundi, Fairfax Media understands.

Etoundi overcame injuries to win a bronze medal in the 77kg class weightlifting on Monday.

Daily Mail Australia has reached out to the Australian Commonwealth Games team for comment.

However, there will reportedly be no statement until chef de mission Steve Moneghetti is made aware of all the facts, The Australian reports.

Etoundi, who was born in Cameroon, suffered pain in his leg, shoulder and arm before winning bronze this week.

After his result he wrote on Facebook: '3rd lift 177kg C&J. Bronze medal! Thankyou to everyone for your support.'

Meanwhile, the Australian athletics team's Commonwealth Games trip is reportedly in a 'crisis of unprecedented proportions' after its head coach slammed the country's biggest track and field star, leading to him being suspended.

Eric Hollingsworth launched an extraordinary attack on Olympic champion Sally Pearson on the eve of her Commonwealth Games 100m hurdles title defence.

The attack has dramatically escalated his falling-out with Pearson, who he said had set a 'bad example' as team captain by declining to attend a pre-Games training camp in Gateshead. Channel 10 reported Hollingsworth had been suspended for his outburst.

'What's lost here is she's the team captain and there's a reasonable expectation she'd be in the camp ahead of something as major as the Commonwealth Games,' Hollingsworth said in a statement issued through a PR company.

'Her no-show sets a bad example to the entire national team.'

Hollingsworth also defended his right to criticise Pearson's inability to defend the world indoors 60m hurdles title in March, after which their relationship broke down completely.

The arrest of an athlete also comes after the brother of an Australian boxer was jailed and charged with aggravated assault at another Commonwealth Games venue on Wednesday.

A 25-year-old man from Perth, Laith Samardali, was so angry about his brother Jordan's defeat in the light heavyweight quarter-finals that he allegedly verbally assaulted the referee.

The furious incident occurred at the Entertainment and Convention Centre.

Bottles were thrown across the room and one of them hit a seven-year-old boy.

On Friday a weightlifter from Papua New Guinea will appear in court over an alleged sexual assault at a Glasgow supermarket.

Papua New Guinea competitor Toua Udia, who competed at the Commonwealth Games on Sunday, was arrested following a report of an incident at a Tesco store near the athletes' village.

The Glasgow Sheriff Court says Udia pleaded not guilty.

The weightlifter, 22, competed at the Clyde Auditorium at the weekend following the alleged assault last Monday.

He reportedly told Fairfax Media that 'it was an accident. I don't want to spoil my reputation.'
