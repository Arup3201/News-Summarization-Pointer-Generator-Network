A 16-year-old 
Southern California girl was killed while sleeping in her bed after her 
allegedly drunk neighbor crashed his SUV into her home in the pre-dawn hours Easter morning.

The LA County police arrived to the gruesome scene sometime around 4am before arresting Roberto Rodriguez of Palmdale.

Shocking photos show the 20-year-old's vehicle still lodged in the home at the very spot where witnesses say Giselle Mendoza moaned helplessly in the final moments of her short life.

Unthinkable: 16-year-old Giselle Mendoza was run over by a car as she slept in her Southern California bedroom in the pre-dawn hours Easter Sunday after an allegedly drunk neighbor smashed his SUV through a wall

Witnesses say the SUV was going as fast as 80 miles-per-hour when it smashed into Giselle Mendoza's apartment, killing her as she slept

Suspect: The 20-year-old suspected drunk driver who killed the Southern California teen, Roberto Rodriguez, is pictured here in his Sunday mugshot. The photo reveals the Palmdale man's minor injuries. He was treated briefly and then taken into custody, where he remained until making 100,000 bail late Sunday

Earlier accounts reported that the Palmdale High School sophomore died on impact, but a more recent recounting reveals a far darker scenario.

'You would hear her moaning, kind of, inside the wall,' eyewitness James Fisher King told CBS Los Angeles.

Fisher King said he watched helplessly as Rodriguez's Nissan Pathfinder careened uncontrollably toward its grim destiny.

'I saw a car coming down 10th, east, about 80-85 mph, and it didn’t stop or hesitate. Just right into the building. Boom,' Fisher King said.

One account says the driver ran a red light just prior to the incident.

Police say preliminary sobriety tests revealed the 20-year-old's blood alcohol content was nearly twice the legal limit.

The tragedy was also gut-wrenchingly close to becoming a even more horrific.

CBS LA is reporting, and Fisher King's account verifies, that the vehicle smashed violently through the bedrooms of two teen girls.

'The car came through her bedroom as well but she was sleeping, thank God, on the couch,' said Earnest Daveport of his 14-year-old daughter.

Mendoza's family, including older sister Yadira Mendoza, put on their bravest faces late Sunday to tell reporters of their unimaginable grief.

'She meant everything, she was my little sister,' said Yadira Mendoza told KABC through sobs. 'What else can I say? We're just hurt. I can't believe this happened.'

'Just right into the building. Boom': Eyewitnesses said the driver careened through a red light before heading uncontrollably toward the Mendoza's apartment building

Nearly even worse: The SUV managed to fly over a curb, through a fence and through two bedrooms in separate apartments, both were those of teenaged girls. A 14-year-old cheated death when she chose to sleep on the couch Saturday night and not in her bedroom

'I’m destroyed now...she lived here,' said the victim's inconsolable father Alberto Mendoza as he gestured toward his heart.

Even through her crippling grief, the stricken big sister hoped Giselle's untimely death can send a message.

'I just want...all the people who drink and drive to stop doing it,' said told KTLA. 'It’s just causing pain for families. They are losing their family members.'

'You would hear her moaning, kind of, inside the wall,' eyewitness James Fisher King said, contradicting early reports that she'd died on impact

Mowed down: By all accounts, the blossoming beauty was a popular high school sophomore and beloved aunt to her sister's children

Before her time: The beloved daughter and sister was a high school sophomore at Palmdale High School. She was killed on impact, authorities say

NBC Los Angeles reports that roughly half the complex's units were evacuated either due to leaking fuel or because they were also damaged by the crash.

L.A. County Sheriff's Sgt. David Sauer said it was possible Rodriguez was driving home and missed his turn, jumped the curb and went straight into the apartment building.

'We just heard a witness who said that he estimated the speed to be about 80 miles an hour,' he said.

Rodriguez was transported to a hospital with minor injuries and booked on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter.

He was released from custody on $100,000 bond late Sunday.

A joyful holiday forever ruined: Giselle's older sister Yadira Mendoza wept as she spoke with reporters and pleaded for an end to drunk driving

Marred: Authorities put up cardboard to cover the hole left by Rodriguez's car. The extensive damage will undoubtedly be repaired, but the mark the freak crash has left on the Mendoza family will be there forever

Suspect: A witness got this cell phone footage of the suspected drunk driving neighbor. Rodriguez is being held in lieu of $100,000 bail
