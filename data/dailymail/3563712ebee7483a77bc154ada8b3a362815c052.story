Having one premature baby is nerve-wracking enough, but one mother is counting her blessings after she had three in 28 months – and all survived against the odds.

Dance teacher Cassana Rason went into labour as early as 22 weeks with each of her children.

The ordeal started when the 25-year-old’s waters broke while she was 35 weeks pregnant with her first child Leo, now six.

She went into hospital but a week of contractions later there was still no sign of the baby, meaning doctors were forced to perform a caesarean section.

‘It was my first baby and didn’t know what to expect,’ she said. ‘The doctor was saying “It is a bit too soon for the baby to be born”, and you think the worst.’

But after a few days of hospital treatment Leo, who was 6lb 2oz at birth, was ready to come home.

Just three months later Mrs Rason fell pregnant again with second son Chase.

Again her waters broke early – 11 weeks before her due date. After 38 hours of contractions, doctors had to perform another C-section.

Chase was born weighing 3lb 6oz, just nine months and three weeks after Leo.

Within a day his right lung had collapsed and doctors discovered a bleed on his brain.

Mrs Rason and her engineer husband Steven, 32, faced an anxious eight-week wait before Chase was well enough to come home and months before they knew whether the bleed had affected his cognitive ability.

Happily, apart from seasonal asthma Chase, now five, is fit and well.

‘It was scary and we just had to sit tight,’ she said. ‘But looking back we could have been in a very different position. Chase is fine, he is very athletic and doing well at school.’

A year after Chase was born, Mrs Rason discovered she was pregnant again.

But at just 22 weeks – 18 weeks before she was due – her waters broke and contractions started.She was immediately taken to hospital where doctors warned the longer she could keep the baby the greater chance it had of being healthy.

Mrs Rason was medicated to stop her from giving birth for five weeks.

But she continued to have painful contractions at least every 20 minutes.

‘Towards the end I was passing out with the pain,’ she said. ‘After five weeks the doctors decided the extent of the stress on my body meant it was time to start delivery. They said “You need to get that baby out now”.’

Sienna-Lilly was born 13 weeks early, weighing just 2lb 3oz. She had four holes in her bowel and had to undergo life-saving surgery to have her large bowel removed.

But she is now a happy, healthy four-year-old who can ‘eat for England’.

Mrs Rason of Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, remains astonished at the resilience of her three children.

‘They are a little inspiration all three of them, they are amazing,’ she said.

Doctors still do not know why she went into labour early or why her contractions did not lead to natural births.

She also suffered postnatal depression which started at the time Chase would have been due.

‘Most mothers of premature babies feel responsible for not carrying them long enough,’ she said.

‘You have this massive guilt for what your baby went through. I felt I was responsible for him being poorly.’

And once her children were all safely at home, she began having panic attacks as a delayed reaction to her experiences.

Her husband, who she describes as ‘a rock who held it together for me’, also suffered with post-traumatic stress.

‘It is only recently we have started to get a life back for us all,’ Mrs Rason said. The couple have decided not to have any more children.

Mrs Rason, a former songwriter, volunteers for premature baby charity BLISS and has penned and recorded a charity single Tiny Hands inspired by her children which is available now on iTunes or as a CD at bliss.org.uk/shop.
