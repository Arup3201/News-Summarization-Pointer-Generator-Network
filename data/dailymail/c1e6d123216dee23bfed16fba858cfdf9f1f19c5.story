Floyd Mayweather vowed to knock out Marcos Maidana AND his trainer Robert Garcia on the same night at a fiery press conference in Chicago.

Mayweather and Garcia re-opened old wounds as they rowed about the type of gloves both men will wear for their rematch on September 13.

The pound-for-pound No 1 objected to the Argentine’s choice ahead of their first meeting and refused to back down on Tuesday.

Plenty of enemies: Mayweather and Marcos Maidana meet for their rematch in September

Talking a good fight: Mayweather is eager to rake in the cash and may agree to the fight for May 2015

Different approaches: Maidana's trainer Robert Garcia addresses the audience while Mayweather signs autographs

At one point Garcia handed him a pink glove to sign before throwing another one at him.

Addressing the crowd, Mayweather said: ‘I was champion when he [Garcia] was champion.

‘He’s long gone away from the sport and I’m [still] champion.

‘On September 13, I’ll still be champion.

‘I’m the type of fighter who can kick a fighter and his trainer’s a**** on the same night.

‘He had his chance to talk and he got up here and said nothing.’

Mayweather later added: ‘Last time out, it’s the truth, I mean, we grabbed the gloves and they had no padding in them at all.

‘If I had those type of gloves, I wouldn’t even want to compete if I have to cheat.

‘First we want to use gloves with no padding then we want to use knees, elbows, and heads and rabbit shots.’

When Garcia took to the podium, Mayweather stood behind him and encouraged the crowd to boo, which they duly did.

Garcia said: ‘You better be ready because this fight’s going to be rougher for you.’

The 39-year-old then dared Mayweather to make a winner-takes-all bet on the fight.

‘Let’s do a bet, winner takes all. Come on Floyd, you’ve got a lot of money,’ he added.

Garcia implored him to shake his hand but instead Mayweather signed autographs for fans.
