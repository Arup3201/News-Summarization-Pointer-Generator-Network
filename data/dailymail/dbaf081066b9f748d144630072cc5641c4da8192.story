A jealous stripper who punched and headbutted a fellow dancer because
she was attracting more punters than her has been jailed for 18 months 
today.

Maria Badea, 20, smashed Gina Ciobotaru in the face so hard that she needed surgery on her nose and a month off work to recover.

The Romanian had warned Miss Ciobotaru that she would be waiting to 
get her outside Soho's French Pussycat Club, where they both worked, for
allegedly stealing her customers.

She later punched Miss Ciobataru on the nose causing her to blackout momentarily and then headbutted her when she tried to call police for help before kneeing her in the stomach and fleeing the scene.

Sentencing Badea at Southwark Crown Court, Judge David Higgins 
described the attack as an 'act of vengeance' which was 'premeditated' 
and 'sustained'.

He said that the attack on Miss Ciobataru was designed to 'maximise 
the pain suffering and loss of amenity which the complainent would 
suffer.'

He added: 'She harboured a grudge and decided to exact revenge.

'I am wholly satisfied that there is no remorse. She has achieved exactly what she set out to achieve.'

Badea admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm but denied the 
premeditation, ferocity, and length of the attack - meaning the judge 
had to make a ruling of fact. 

Miss Ciobotaru, who no longer works at the club, told the court that Badea was angry that she was taking her customers.

Both women worked at the French Pussycat club in Soho at the time of the attack in February

She said: 'She told me she was going to wait for me outside. She said she would punch me.'

During the heated exchange on February 7 last year in the strippers' 
changing room at the Walker's Court club, Badea screamed 'You f***ing 
bitch, I will wait for you and then I will look after you.'

Frightened Miss Ciobotaru told the club manager who offered to walk her home.

But she and a fellow stripper went for dinner at a nearby Lebanese 
restaurant. Badea, described in court as a 'habitual liar' followed her 
to the restaurant and then waited for her outside. 

She confronted her on Shaftesbury Avenue and punched her on the bridge 
of the nose, causing her to blackout for a couple of seconds. 

As the dancer walked away and called police, Badea snatched her phone - telling her: 'Police won’t do anything. I am a woman.'

She then grabbed her hair, pulled her head back, and headbutted her, 
hitting the bridge of her nose again. Miss Ciobotaru fell to the floor 
as Badea kneed her in the stomach before running away.

Trial: The judge at Southwark Crown Court, pictured described Badea's behaviour as 'disgusting, deplorable, and deeply anti-social'

Addressing Badea, Judge Higgins said: 'Your conduct was disgusting, deplorable, and deeply anti-social.'

Miss Ciobotaru said the attack had left her scared to go out and she said Badea had threatened to get someone to follow her.
Badea claimed her rival called her a 'whore' and a 'pervert' then 
screamed at her in their native Romanian: 'F*** your dead relatives you 
whore.'

But the judge ruled she presented a 'tissue of lies designed to reduce 
her culpability' and even if Miss Ciobotaru had used such language it 
would not have justified the 'extreme violence' used against her.

Judge Higgins said: 'Such violence and fear of it eats into the very 
fabric of our society and it is rightly regarded by the public with both
abhorrence and outrage.'

He recommended that Badea and one of her fellow strippers who gave 
evidence on her behalf be investigated for perverting the course of 
justice.

When she is released the authorities will have to look into deportation because of the length of the sentence
