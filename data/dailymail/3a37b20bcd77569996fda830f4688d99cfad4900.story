Upon searching a garage on the premises, officers allegedly located an indoor cannabis crop inside.

The 55-year-old was granted bail under the condition he report to Bondi Police Station every day.

His case will be heard again on January 18 at Waverley court.

Coffey rose to prominence after appearing on the Ray Martin's Midday Show and 'causing a furor' after he pretended to juggle live kittens and a chainsaw, which was turned on.

The stunt, which was 'all in the name of comedy', sparked outrage in viewers, according to the juggler's website.

Coffey has also entertained people at private functions for late media mogul Kerry Packer, entrepreneur John Singleton and former prime minister Paul Keating.

The entertainer's act merges juggling, fire-eating and death-defying feats, which are 'all wrapped up with non-stop humour'.

Coffey puts his popularity down to 'large doses of sidesplitting audience involvement' and is sought after for corporate events.

He is originally from Canada but is now an Australian citizen.
