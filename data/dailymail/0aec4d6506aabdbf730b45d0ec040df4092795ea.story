One man went above and beyond in creating the perfect proposal for his girlfriend.

Levy Randolph, of Gainesville, Florida, flew his girlfriend, Tiffany Rogers, to California for what he said was a military event honoring his father before surprising her with a day of pampering, shopping, food and champagne that all ended with a romantic proposal at Rose Bowl Stadium.

Even better, Tiffany said 'Yes.'

It all began in the morning when Levy had two of Tiffany's friends surprise her at the house they were staying in, and take her out for the day.

Then, a stretch Hummer pulled up, at which point three more of Tiffany's friends popped out to surprise her.

The girls all headed to get manicures and pedicures, and when they got to the salon, two more of Tiffany's friends were there to surprise the lucky lady.

From there the group headed to lunch and to find Tiffany the perfect dress for the night.

Finally, they arrived back at the hotel where Tiffany's mom was waiting to help her get ready, at which point the bride had to have figured out what was probably going on.

Then, a blindfolded Tiffany headed to Rose Bowl Stadium, where she got another surprise when her father was there to walk her in and Levy popped the question.

'I decided to bring you back where it all started,' Levy said, referencing the fact that the pair met there five years ago.
