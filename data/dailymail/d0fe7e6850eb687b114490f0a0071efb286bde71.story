A family from North Carolina had to change their vacation plans after a hotel canceled their reservation because of their son's service dog.

Golden retriever Chip is never far from the side of Karen Vaughn's son, Beau, who has a rare form of epilepsy.

But despite a law allowing service dogs in all facilities, the owner of Baton Rouge Best Western refused to have the animal on the hotel premises.Â

Vital: Service dog Chip, who has been trained to spot the early signs of a seizure, goes everywhere with Beau

Ms Vaughn said she was shocked when she received an email telling her the family's reservation at the Siegen Inn had been cancelled.

When the attorney and mother-of-two pushed for an explanation, she was told that the Best Western was not pet friendly.

Chip is far from being a family pet however. The dog has been trained to alert Beau and his family before the 13-year-old, who has Landau-Kleffner Syndrome, suffers a seizure.

And being right by his young owner's side - including in restaurants and on vacations - is never usually a problem.

'He's been at the hospital with Beau when Beau had to have surgery. He was in the pre-operative room,' Ms Vaughn told WAFB.

Under the American with Disabilities Act, service dogs should be welcome at any place open to the public, and without prior notice.

As a courtesy, the family always calls 
ahead when staying in hotels to let the staff know a service dog will be
 traveling with them.

Ms Vaughn said that after alerting the Best Western in Baton Rouge, she was told the hotel could no longer honor her booking.

'We got an email saying due to unforeseen circumstances, they will not be able to honor our reservations,' she said.

A reception later told WAFB that although she is aware of the law, the staff were unable to go against what the hotel owner had ruled.

Best Western's corporate office has since reached out to Ms Vaughn, and offered to let her family stay at the hotel - but she declined their offer.

'I've already booked with another hotel 
that's understanding and happy to follow the law. I don't want to go to a
 hotel where I have to force them to follow the law,' she said.
