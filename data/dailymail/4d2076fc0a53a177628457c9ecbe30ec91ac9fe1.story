Serena Williams was forced to drop out of Wimbledon this summer after being hit by a virus, but the tennis star seems have fully recovered as she holidays with friends.

The 32-year-old was forced to pull out of her women's doubles second-round match with sister Venus as the pair attempted to take on Kritina Barrois and Stefanie Voegele.

Serena was also beaten by Alize Cornet in the women's singles during a difficult time in SW19, but she seems to have put the illness behind her with a trip to Pula, Croatia.

'I am heartbroken I'm not able to continue in the tournament,' Serena said in a statement.

'I thought I could rally this morning, because I really wanted to compete, but this bug just got the best of me.'

The Michigan-native was also seen visiting a candy store in Novigrad on Friday. And she didn't just eye the sweet treats. Serena was spotted with a small white bag of goodies to-go, as she explored the town with her posse

 added: 'Unfortunately, Serena has been feeling unwell for the past few 
days and she just couldn't play to her potential today.

'I'm really proud of her for trying, because we just love playing doubles together.'

In
 her service game, the star was struggling to bounce the ball and keep 
it under any semblance of control, and the first two double faults at 
the beginning of her first service game highlighted the difficulties she
 was experiencing.
