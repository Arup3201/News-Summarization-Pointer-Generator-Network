Tiger Woods insists he 'feels great' ahead of his return to competitive golf this week after nearly four months out following back surgery.

With his 39th birthday approaching later this month, the 14-time major champion faces serious questions over his future in the game. He has endured a year beset by back problems and a catalogue of injuries that date back to when he won his last major, the US Open in 2008, with a broken leg and torn ACL.

Woods has watched Rory McIlroy usurp him as the brightest star in the game but returns to action at his own tournament, the Hero World Challenge in Florida, promising that he is 'healed', 'stronger' and finally able to put in enough practice to hone his game to the highest standards.

Tiger Woods returns to golf this week after four months out following back surgery

Woods was last seen in action during a sorry, injury-plagued performance at the US PGA Championship

'I feel great,' Woods told SiriusXM PGA TOUR Radio on Monday. 'I feel really, really good. It's great to be back out here competing again. I've missed it quite a bit.'

Woods's last appearance before undergoing surgery on a herniated disc in his back was a sad sight, with the former world No 1 grimacing his way round Valhalla at the US PGA Championship.

He has since fired swing coach Sean Foley and hired Chris Como to take his place. The early results of their work were put on show in a video released online on Monday (watch below).

Their progress will come under further scrutiny at Isleworth during the annual event to raise money for the Tiger Woods Foundation, but the American is happy with the results so far.

'I'm excited that I have this much time off to obviously heal and get stronger and get my game in order for next year,' said Woods. 'I went through a period there for the last year, year and a half, where I didn't really practice that much.'

'I can finally log in the time, log in the minutes, and really delve into a good practice session and really get a lot out of it,' he said. 'And that's something that I hadn't been able to do in quite some time.'

The 2008 US Open remains the last major of 14 won by Woods with injuries having beset his career since
