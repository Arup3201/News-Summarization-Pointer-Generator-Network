As the anniversary of Peaches Geldof’s heroin overdose draws near her £1 million home in Kent lies abandoned, a haunting reminder of young mother’s tragic death.

With a pram parked by the door, and toys littering the garden, it is the world of a busy family with two young children stopped in time.

The country house where Peaches Geldof once lived has reportedly lain uninhabited since the mother-of-two's body was discovered in an upstairs bedroom after overdosing on heroin.

The £1 million property, in Wrotham, Kent, appears almost exactly as it was following the journalist and presenter's death in April last year

Peaches' family, her father, Sir Bob Geldof, her sisters, Pixie, Fifi, and Tiger-Lily, husband Tom and her two young sons are to reunite for the anniversary, the Sunday Mirror reported.

Pixie Geldof has said she will not be appearing at this year’s Coachella Festival in California so that she can be in the UK for the anniversary of her beloved sister’s death.

A source close to Pixie was quoted as saying she had the choice to perform but preferred to be with her family. She has also reportedly signed a new contract with a record label, penning a number of songs inspired by Peaches.

 A song about her sister will be released later this year.

 On the quiet family day planned by Sir Bob to mark the anniversary the family will recall fond memories of Peaches. 

However, while doing their best to move on from the young woman's death nearly one year ago, Peaches' family home remains untouched and unsold, despite its considerable value.

The £1 million property, in Wrotham, Kent, appears almost exactly as it was following the journalist and presenter's death in April last year, and her widower, Tom Cohen, is said to have never returned to their marital home.

Miss Geldof's home is not believed to be for sale, but Mr Cohen is said to be staying with their children Astala, two, and Phaedra, one, at his parents' home in South East London.

It was Mr Cohen who discovered his wife's body at the home they shared, after he returned from a weekend away on April 7.

An inquest in July heard that Peaches - daughter of late TV presenter Paula Yates and musician Bob Geldof - had started using heroin again in February, after taking the substitute drug methadone for two and a half years.

Coroner Roger Hatch said she took a fatal dose of high-purity heroin shortly before she was found dead. At the time of the tragedy Kent Police said the death was ‘sudden’ and ‘unexplained’.

But her husband told the inquest he had seen Peaches flushing drugs she had hidden in the loft of their home down the toilet.

Their one-year-old son Phaedra was in the house with his mother.

Mr Hatch said the young mother had been trying to wean herself off drugs and had been clean months before her death but had relapsed.

Mr Geldof said he blames himself for the death of Peaches, adding that he ‘goes over and over and over’ what he could have done to help her after she started using the drug again in the months leading up to her death.

He described the journalist, model and television presenter as ‘super bright’ but ‘frantic’.
