A previously unknown anti-establishment group has claimed responsibility for a drive-by shooting which killed two men in Greece.

The Militant People's Revolutionary Forces said its members were behind the death of two Golden Dawn supporters gunned down outside the party's headquarters earlier this month.

The organisation said the killings were in retaliation for the fatal stabbing of anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fissas in September by a man who claimed to be a sympathiser of far-right party Golden Dawn.

The Militant People's Revolutionary Forces' has claimed responsibility for the drive-by shooting of two members of Greece's far-right part Golden Dawn earlier this month

The group said the killings were revenge for the fatal stabbing of anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fissas in September which sparked violent protests in the Greek capital

The two victims were gunned down outside Golden Dawn's headquarters in Athens while a third man aged 29 was taken to hospital

In an 18-page letter posted online the group explained their motivation, saying that the stabbing had been 'the drop of blood that made the glass overflow'.

It added: 'The armed attack-response ... is the starting point of the people's campaign to send the neo-Nazi scum of Golden Dawn where they belong, to the dustbin of history.'

Police were unable to confirm authenticity of the claim, which came on the eve of rallies to commemorate the 40th anniversary of a bloody student uprising against the military junta that ruled Greece at the time.

Pavlos Fyssas, the rapper who was stabbed in the working-class Athens district of Keratsini early on September 18 by a 45-year-old truck driver who proclaimed his Golden Dawn sympathies

The two victims, aged 22 and 27, were shot at close range outside a Golden Dawn office in Athens' Neo Iraklio suburb by two men riding a motorcycle.

'A man got off a motorcycle wearing a helmet and shot them,' Golden Dawn lawmaker Georgios Germenis told The Associated Press.

A statement on the party's website described how the gunmen had 'literally emptied their weapons' into the victims.

A third man, aged 29, was taken to hospital severely wounded after he too was shot.

The government and opposition parties quickly condemned the shootings, which the left-wing main opposition Syriza said 'targets democracy' in Greece.

Golden Dawn has previously suggested that all immigrants should be put into work camps and said it wants mines laid along the border with Turkey

Golden Dawn denies accusations of violence and rejects the neo-Nazi label. It denies any involvement in Fissas's killing.

An opinion poll released on Saturday indicated that support for Golden Dawn had grown since the two men were gunned down.

The party, Greece's third most popular in surveys, had shed almost a third of its support after Fissas's death.

Fissas, whop went by the stage name of Killah P, was stabbed in the working-class Athens district of Keratsini early on September 18 by a 45-year-old truck driver who has confessed.

The attack prompted a crackdown on Golden Dawn and its leader Nicholas Mihaloliakos, along with five more party members, were arrested for being part of a criminal organisation.

Mihaloliakos and two others are still in custody while they await trail. Their arrests marked the first time since 1974 that sitting members of Parliament have been arrested.
