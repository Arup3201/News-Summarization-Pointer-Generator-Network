One person's trash really is another person's treasure in Brazil, where a group of garbage collectors are making spectacular art out of landfill.

The catadores, as they're known, of the ASMARE cooperative in the city of Belo Horizonte spend their days sifting through piles of old, discarded material.

With the help of local artists and volunteers, they then transform the junk they find into furniture, jewelry or works of art.

'I have two jobs,' collector Edimar Ferreira, 39, told CNN in its documentary On the Road to Brazil. 'I go and collect the trash and then I transform it into art. I make small sofas, wooden benches, tables, and other plastic adornments.'

He added: 'We have a phrase: 'o seu lixo e o meu luxo,' roughly translated as "your trash is our luxury."'

According to CNN, catadores are a common sight not just in Belo Horizonte but in cities and towns all across Brazil.

A 2010 estimate suggested there were 
roughly one million catadores in the country though only a small number 
are affiliated with a cooperative or organized group.

All sorts: Paper, cans, bottles and other recyclable objects are all turned into art or jewelry and sold

The
 people - often formerly homeless or ex-convicts - search for cans, 
bottles, metals and other recyclable materials in the street trash.

But the living they can earn has dwindled over the years.

To help them out, groups like ASMARE teach the workers how to transform the recyclable trash they collect into art or other useful items.

All the treasures the trash collectors 
create at the organization are sold at a nearby shop and the profits are 
divided evenly among the catadores.

With
 the art sales and their usual income from collecting recyclables, a 
catadore affiliated with ASMARE earns around 1,700 Brazilian Reais or 
$800 U.S. dollars a month - a respectable wage.

'The
 art center started with the purpose of us being able to make our own 
carts, and then for the catadores' children to learn how to make crafts 
and other art pieces with the material collected,' ASMARE founder and 
president Dona Geralda told CNN.

Mauricio Soares, an artist who heads the ASMARE creative program, says helping catadores to produce art also encourages other citizens to see them in a more positive light.

'In Brazil the catadore is often discriminated against because of their origin,' Soares told CNN.

'Therefore, linking art to recycling allows them to go to places that they have never been before and they end up having better acceptance because their creative work gives them a good visibility.'

He said the program also promoted recycling and helped people rethink what is trash and what isn't.
