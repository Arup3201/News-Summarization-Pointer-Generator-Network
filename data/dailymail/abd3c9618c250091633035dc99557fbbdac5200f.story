Alan Pardew is mad and bad? Rubbish. This is a bold and clever decision and the right time for him to escape from Newcastle.

He can leave knowing he has done a good job in difficult circumstances. Not a brilliant job. He didn’t win them a trophy. But nor did Bobby Robson. Or Ruud Gullit. Or Kenny Dalglish. Or Kevin Keegan. Or Graeme Souness. Or Alan Shearer. Think of how decorated they all were as players, but they could not lift Newcastle to the heights their supporters demand.

It is 45 years since Newcastle won a trophy, but Pardew finished fifth in his best season in the Barclays Premier League and consolidated their position, with a pretty average team and a club that sells its best players.

Alan Pardew spent four turbulent years as Newcastle manager before leaving the club on Monday

Club legend Kevin Keegan spent two spells as Newcastle manager and narrowly missed out on the title

Last time it was Yohan Cabaye, next time it will be Moussa Sissoko. There is only so much a man can take.

He was manager of the month last month, having lifted Newcastle from the foot of the table with a six-game winning run, before losing 1-0 at West Ham on November 29. Since then, they have beaten leaders Chelsea — the only team to do so this season — but lost 1-0 at home to Sunderland. It is typical of their frustrating, rollercoaster form.

Alan was always a couple of wins from a crisis.

Kenny Dalglish was only boss at Newcastle for a year and a half before leaving in the summer of 1998

Ruud Gullit replaced Dalglish in the Newcastle dugout but only last a year in the hot seat at St James' Park

The Newcastle fans created a 'sack Pardew' campaign which was at it's strongest this season

Pardew made 128 league appearances between 1987 and 1991, scoring eight goals.

The highlight of his time at Selhurst Park, however, was the FA Cup run in the 1989-90 season.

Pardew was one of the 'Fab Four' (with Mark Bright, Gary O'Reilly and Andy Gray) and scored the winner against Liverpool in that memorable 4-3 semi-final victory at Villa Park (the other three also netted in that match).

The Eagles pushed Manchester United all the way in the Wembley final, drawing 3-3 in the first match, but lost 1-0 in the replay.

Pardew played every minute of both matches.

Two defeats and the ‘Pardew Out’ brigade demand their say; their banners ready to be unfurled again. ‘Pardew is a Muppet’ one banner derided.

He behaved with dignity and turned them around, but never really won them over.

Do not underestimate the lure of London for someone born in Wimbledon — and the chance to return to a club where he is admired and respected and where he will feel supported.

At Newcastle — potentially a powerhouse football club — Pardew may have received an eight-year contract, but did he ever really feel like the man they wanted?

I can’t hear too many Newcastle fans complaining about his departure, but there are some in football who are questioning his motives. ‘Why is he leaving a big club for a small club? He must be crazy.’

But, as a manager — and it’s the same as a player — you know when your time is up. This is good timing for Alan and he is joining a good club.

Yes, Palace are a smaller club than Newcastle (and they are 10 points worse off) but he will revel in the freedom of a job where he can actually manage. I wish him well.

Palace have been interested before, but this was the right time. Yes, he faces a relegation battle but he enters a transfer window with an owner who will listen to his ideas.

In the end, you go where you’re wanted.
