'Rowdy Ronda' Rousey made history on Saturday night when she used her signature elbow-breaking move to steal victory in the Ultimate Fighting Championships' first ever female event.

The former judo champion beat Liz Carmouche on an armbar with 11 seconds left in the first round of their bantamweight title fight at UFC 157 in Anaheim, California.

Rousey (7-0) defended her belt with her seemingly inevitable move, forcing Carmouche to tap out after bending back her arm.

The 25-year-old Californian raised both 
arms in victory while flat on the canvas after the longest fight of the 
mixed martial artist's ascendant career.

'Is this real life right now? I'm not sure,' said Rousey, who has just two years of pro MMA experience.

The sellout crowd largely showed up to see the rising star, whose unique combination of star power, athleticism and skill highhandedly ended UFC President Dana White's long-standing disinterest in women's MMA.

White even put Rousey and Carmouche in the main event of a pay-per-view show by the sport's dominant promotion.

Rousey
was awarded the equivalent of the bantamweight belt she won in the 
now-defunct Strikeforce before her first UFC fight, but quickly showed 
she deserved it.

'I was actually less nervous walking out
than I was for some of my earlier fights,' Rousey said.

'I felt like 
the UFC champion, and I know how hard I am working. This was a wild 
ride, and I can't wait to get back in the octagon.'

Rousey and Carmouche didn't 
disappoint in their pressure-packed debuts. Although Rousey was heavily 
favored, Carmouche (7-3) actually had Rousey in trouble early, nearly 
landing a rear naked choke while clinging to Rousey's back in the 
opening two minutes.

Rousey, who had never been seriously 
threatened in any previous bout, barely escaped the chokehold by getting
her chin and mouth underneath Carmouche's arm.

Rousey gradually imposed her will on 
the former Marine after that, rolling her across the canvas and finally 
getting side control on Carmouche before patiently separating her arms 
to land an armbar.

'That was the most vulnerable a 
position I've been in so far in my career,' Rousey said. 'That was 
pretty tight, that neck crank, and I was very happy to get out of it.

She
had the choke across my mouth and ... her forearm was pushing against 
my teeth. That can't have been any more fun for her than it was for me. 
Crazy sport we're in, huh?'

Rousey
has won all seven of her professional MMA bouts and three amateur 
fights by armbar, a judo move that has dislocated at least two prior 
opponents' elbows, though not Carmouche's.

'I had to learn to take my time in 
MMA, and I was just able to keep a clear head,' said Rousey, who became 
the first American woman to win an Olympic judo medal in Beijing.

She said the pressure wasn't anything she couldn't handle.

'There's no amount of press that can save these girls from me,' she said.

Carmouche earned a huge ovation from the sellout crowd for giving Rousey more trouble than she had ever faced.

'I thought I had it,' said Carmouche,
who served three tours of duty in Iraq. 'Like everything else, you make
a mistake, and it turns around.'

It was announced in November that Rousey would compete in the historic event, after days of speculation.

She took to Twitter to discuss the news, saying: 'Okay I admit it... I'm officially a @ufc fighter :) SO excited! Can't wait to debut! Let @danawhite know who you want my 1st opponent to be!'

The 25-year-old was the youngest judoka in the 2004 Olympics, then returned to the Games in Beijing in 2008. She won the bronze in the women's 70kg category, becoming the first female fighter from the U.S. to take home a medal.
