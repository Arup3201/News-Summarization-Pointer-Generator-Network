Amy Childs has been showcasing her fashion credentials in Marbella and now her fans can emulate her look thanks to her new range.

The TOWIE star and fashion designer has unveiled - and modelled - her new high-summer range, kicking off with her capsule collection inspired by bold prints and summer events.

Speaking to MailOnline about the new drop, Amy, 24, said: ‘Summer is in full swing so it's time to break out the prints and really have fun with your fashion.’

‘The collection is inspired by bold colours and trends that should be embraced this summer,' she said.

Posing up: While there's no denying she looks incredible in her new range, Amy recently admitted she has removed her lip fillers and is considering taking out her breast implants

Amy's new collection, which seemingly takes inspiration from Peter Pilotto's collection, contrasts delicate floral patterns with strong asymmetric lines and she promises it caters to all styles and tastes.

‘I was inspired by the summer events for my collection,' she says.

'Every time I think about summer I think of Wimbledon fashion with its soft florals and whites, I think festivals with bold and fun mini dresses with wellies; there’s so many different occasions and themes for summer fashion - I love it.'

While there's no denying she looks incredible in her new range, Amy recently admitted to Heat magazine she has removed her lip fillers and is considering taking out her breast implants.

'The 
implant has come away from my breast tissue in my left boob. I had an 
ultrasound and it showed that I had a build up of fluid,' she said.

'I'm facing 
having the implants taken out, the fluid drained, then having them put 
in again. I can't bear the thought of having more surgery.'

Before jetting off for her holiday, the star completed her weekly radio segment on Fubar Radio with comedian Joey Page.

'This
 is completely new and different for me. I am looking forward to working
 with Joey – we are so different but have great banter,' the designer 
said of her exciting gig in May.

Inspiration? Amy's range is very similar to Peter Pilotto's £2,100 designs, left, but Amy's come with a much smaller price tag at around £50

Amy will be heading to Southampton to open a pop up shop in Southampton’s West Quay Shopping Centre on the 5th and 6th July 2014.

The shop will include her nation-wide clothing collection as well as her beauty products and perfume, making it perfect for all fashion and Amy Childs fans alike - the star herself will also be there for a meet and greet with her fans and also to advise you on her latest clothing pieces and tanning products.
