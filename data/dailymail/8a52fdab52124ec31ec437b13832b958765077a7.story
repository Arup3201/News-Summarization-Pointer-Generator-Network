Ander Herrera believes he is playing behind the best three strikers in world football at Manchester United.

Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao all scored for their respective countries over the weekend.

Falcao scored on his first start for Colombia in a year, while Rooney grabbed England's winner against Estonia and Van Persie was on target for Holland against Kazakhstan.

Herrera, who is nursing a fractured rib, wants to follow suit and add to his own goal tally - having scored twice for United - but says the emphasis is on making the club's new Holy Trinity one to remember.

'I want to try to score more goals. It's very important for the midfielders,' he told the November issue of Inside United. 'I like assists as well and I think we have maybe the best three strikers in the world here in Rooney, van Persie and Falcao.

'Juan [Mata], Angel [Di Maria], Adnan [Januzaj], Daley [Blind], Fletch [Darren Fletcher] and me are all going to help them try to score, and if I score of course I'll be very happy.'

Manchester United may have three gems in Rooney, Van Persie and Falcao but they will have to go some to match the original Holy Trinity - George Best, Bobby Charlton and Denis Law - in United fans' affections.

Herrera has no set return date yet as he continues his recovery but is keen to figure in forthcoming games against Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal.

'The Premier League is a great league,' he says. 'It's a very quick league, non-stop and great spectacle for the fans. That's good because sometimes in other countries there are more teams that try to keep the ball in their end of the pitch but in the Premier League you will see a lot of goals. 

'It's a difficult league, there are tough games against Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, Spurs, City and Everton; it's a great challenge.'
