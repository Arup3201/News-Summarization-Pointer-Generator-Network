A chocolate labrador who flies around the UK with her owner in his six-seater Cessna light aircraft has been given a crew card after racking up more than 250 flying hours.

Three-year-old Callie, who flies with Graham Mountford, 50, is now able to pass through the Crew Only channels at airports after becoming the only dog in the country to be recognised by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots' Association (AOPA).

The pet, who takes to the skies every weekend and has flown more than 50,000 miles, has goggles, a special harness to strap her into the cockpit, and is rewarded with a sausage when she lands.

Callie, who is three, has clocked up more than 250 flying hours with her pilot owner, Graham Mountford, 50

The chocolate labrador wears her own goggles, hat and harness - and gets a sausage every time they land

Chocks away! Callie first got in a plane when she was a 12-week-old puppy - now she is an old hand

Mr Mountford, from Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, has been a private pilot for 13 years and first took Callie, who resembles cartoon flying dog, Muttley, up in the air with him when she was just a three-month-old puppy.

She leaps into his Cessna 210 Centurion happily, and has touched won at airports across Britain, including Cornwall, Wales and various far-flung Scottish islands.

Mr Mountford said: 'I used to go flying with friends, but when we got Callie three years ago I thought it would be fun to take her up in the plane with me.

'I bought some small ear protectors for her to wear and the first time we just taxied around the airport to make sure she enjoyed it.

'It all went well so we then went on a short flight and she took it all in her stride and seemed very happy.'

Now the pair fly most weekends, visiting beaches such as Barra in Scotland, Perranporth in Cornwall and Caernarfon in Wales, where Callie enjoys a run on the sand and a sausage.

Needs a pawprint: Callie is the only dog to have an Aircraft Owners' and Pilots' Association crew card

VIP access: Now Callie has her card, she can go through special channels at many airports across the UK

Mr Mountford said: 'She usually sits next to me in the front of the plane but if other people come with me she will stretch out on the back seat,'

'I get a lot of comments and smiles when I land at an airport and people realise my co-pilot is a dog.'

He added: 'Callie usually wears a fluorescent jacket and as soon as she puts it on, she knows she is going flying. She loves dressing up for the part.'

The crew card came about after Mr Mountford visited the AOPA at an exhibition and told them how many flying hours his labrador had.Â 

He was told she was eligible for a VIP card, which gives the holder benefits including hotel and hire car discounts, and a card duly arrived in the post soon afterwards.

He said: 'I have shown the card, along with mine, at some of the bigger airports and it always causes great amusement. Even the most glum security men break into a smile.'

Mr Mountford gave Callie her first taste of flying by simply taxiing around the runway - but she liked it

Man's best friend: Mr Mountford used to go flying with friends, but now he prefers to take Callie in his Cessna

Muttley was the canine sidekick of the hapless baddie, Dick Dastardly, in the Hanna-Barbera Wacky Races and other cartoons.

Muttley first appeared in Wacky Races in 1968, but the cartoon's popularity was such that it continued well into the new millennium.

Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines was a series of cartoons in which the duo tried to catch Yankee Doodle Pigeon, a carrier pigeon who carried secret messages to their opponents.

With the two villains featuring as aviators in the Vulture Squadron, they wore Aviator caps and goggles and tried, but usually failed, to capture their feathered foe.

The cartoon series' original run was from 1969-1970, but it garnered such a fanbase that it was syndicated throughout the 1970s and 1980s, before a box-set was released in 2005.
