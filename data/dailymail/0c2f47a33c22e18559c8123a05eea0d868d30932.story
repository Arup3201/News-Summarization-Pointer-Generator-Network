Police shot a 17-year-old who opened fire during a high school football game between two local rivals.

Eugene Brantley was hit in the arm by officers after interrupting the game between Mays and Carver high schools at Lakewood Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, on Friday night.

Witnesses say there were about nine minutes left in the fourth quarter when they started hearing gunshots from outside the stadium. 

Stopped: This is the dramatic moment a police officer restrained 17-year-old Eugene Brantley on the side of a football pitch after he opened fire during a game between two high school football rivals 

Response: Officers swarm around  Brantley who was shot in the arm after interrupting the game between Mays and Carver high schools at Lakewood Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia

Some said around a dozen were fired as terrified players, cheerleaders and spectators tried to flee the scene. 

Brantley was then shot and was subsequently restrained by police on the track circling the outfield.  

Jonathan Gooch told WXIA. 'The first two went off and everyone stopped and started looking around thinking there can't be gunshots. 

'After the next five, six, seven, all the players started running, all the coaches started running, all the officials jumped down to the ground, the cheerleaders didn't know where to go.'

The game was called off after the ordeal, however because of play off implications, they will have to reschedule the game and start from the point where it was abandoned/  

Atlanta Public Schools have canceled or moved all high school and middle school games scheduled to be played at the stadium Saturday. 

In the aftermath, Brantley was charged with carrying a concealed weapon, obstruction, reckless conduct and carrying a weapon on school property.

He was taken to hospital following the shooting and is said to be still receiving treatment. 

It is the second shooting at a school in the area this month. 

On Octber 3, Kristofer Hunter, a 17-year-old student was shot to death in the parking lot outside of Langston Hughes High School in Fairburn following a game.
