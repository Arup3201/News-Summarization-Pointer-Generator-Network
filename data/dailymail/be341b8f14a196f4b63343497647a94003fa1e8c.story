A commander of the terrorist group behind the Nairobi attack was questioned by MI5 over plans to blow up a Kenyan shopping centre four years ago.

Bilal Berjawi, then a British citizen, was arrested in Kenya by counter-terrorism officers who claimed to be working on instructions from MI5.

Berjawi, who also went by the name Abu Omar, was questioned again on his return to Britain by the Security Service. At the time, he was a secret member of Al Shabaab, but MI5 and the Kenyans accused him of being a member of Al Qaeda.

According to his account, he was held 
in Nairobi for four days by Kenyan officers who were fed questions by 
MI5.

They accused him of planning to blow up an Israeli-owned 
supermarket in an attack sanctioned by Osama bin Laden. 

The
 Westgate Mall, which includes a large supermarket, is Israeli-owned. 
Berjawi’s account, if true, suggests a failure of intelligence by MI5 
and the Kenyan authorities.

Security
 at the mall in the days leading up to the attack was lax, even despite 
the Kenyan authorities receiving more recent warnings of an imminent 
attack from the UN.

Berjawi’s
 account was given to Cageprisoners, a British charity which campaigns 
against alleged mistreatment of terror suspects.

Berjawi,
 who is of Lebanese origin, went to Somalia and joined Al Shabaab in 
2006. He returned to the UK a year later to raise funds for the 
terrorists.

He stayed 
at his family’s council house in North Kensington, West London, before 
leaving for Kenya, where he was detained. He told Cageprisoners the 
Kenyans accused him of being an Al Qaeda suicide bomber who had trained 
in Afghanistan.

'He returned to Somalia in 2009 and rose to become a senior figure in the group Al Qaeda in East Africa, a radical part of Al Shabaab.

He was suspected of crossing into Uganda in 2010 where he took part in the Al Shabaab attacks at two bars as fans watched the World Cup final. The blasts killed 74.

He was stripped of his British citizenship and, according to Al Shabaab, was killed in January last year by a US drone missile.

Last night, MI5 would not say whether it knew of an attack on Westgate Mall four years ago, but a security source said: ‘There is often terrorist chatter about targets for spectacular attacks and over the years the same targets pop up.’
