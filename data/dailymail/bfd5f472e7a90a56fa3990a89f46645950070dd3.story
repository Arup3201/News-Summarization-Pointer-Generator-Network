David Cameron, who is on a visit to Liberia, has been warned by the UK Statistics Authority he must understand the difference between debt and the deficit

David Cameron was today accused told off by the official statistics watchdog for claiming the government had cut the nation’s debts.

The Prime Minister boasted in a Tory party election broadcast that he was ‘paying down Britain's debts’.

But the UK Statistics Authority today wrote to Number 10 pointing out that public net debt has actually risen by £290billion since the coalition was formed.

Labour’s Rachel Reeves said the slapdown was ‘hugely embarrassing’ for the PM.

The row centres on the difference between the national debt and the deficit.

Total national debt – the amount that the UK public sector owes – has risen from £811 billion in 2010 to £1.1 trillion at the end of last year.

However, the deficit – the gap between what the Treasury spends and what it receives in taxes – has fallen, from £159.0 billion in 2009-10 to £121.6 billion for 2011-12.

In a strongly-worded letter, today Andrew Dilnot, chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, said politicians must be clear about the difference between the two.

‘It is clearly important for all parties to public debate in this area to understand the relevant statistical definitions and to distinguish changes in the level of debt outstanding from changes in borrowing per period, and to reflect these in their communication of the statistical trends involved,’ he wrote in a letter to the Labour party which he also sent to Downing Street.

UK Statistics Authority chairman Andrew Dilnot sent these two graphs to Number 10 to explain how the nation's debts were rising while borrowing had fallen

‘Public sector net debt is a measure of how much the UK public sector owes at a given time. Public sector net borrowing is the difference between total accrued receipts and total accrued (current and capital) expenditure over a specified period; this measure is frequently used by commentators to summarise the extent of any public sector 'deficit'.’

He added that he was sending a copy of the letter - with accompanying graphs setting out the relevant data - to Mr Cameron's chief of staff, Ed Llewellyn.

Miss Reeves, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘It is hugely embarrassing for David Cameron that he has had to have the difference between borrowing and debt explained to him by the chair of the UK Statistics Authority.

‘Now that his false claims have been exposed, it's time the Prime Minister stopped deliberately misleading people about his economic record.’
