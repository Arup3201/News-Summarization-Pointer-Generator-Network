An ex-CBS reporter is releasing a book that blames mainstream media outlets for covering for President Obama.

Sharyl Attkisson left CBS in the spring and opened up about her former employer and colleagues in 'Stonewalled' and claims that the media is liberal and covers up for the current administration. 

According to a review in the New York Post, officials within the administration constantly criticized Attkisson's report efforts as 'unreasonable.'

Stonewalled: Ex-CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson says that she encountered obstacles from the Obama administration and her own colleagues while reporting

Eric Schultz, part of the Obama press team, reportedly yelled at her when she pressed him about the scandal over the ATF's gunwalking scheme called Operation Fast and Furious.

'Goddammit, Sharyl!' he shouted. 'The Washington Post is reasonable, the LA Times is reasonable, The New York Times is reasonable. You’re the only one who’s not reasonable!'

Attkisson, who is now senior independent contributor for The Daily Signal, a media channel for conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, claims in her book that corporate media is hesitant to court controversy.

While reporting on the shortcomings of Red Cross disaster relief efforts in the period following Hurricane Katrina, Attkisson says she was told to wait for CBS's stock split with Viacomm to report anything that might unsettle to corporate partners.

She also says that her employer, CBS News, would kill stories or direct her away from lines of reporting critical of the Obama administration.

Attkisson writes a colleague told her that one executive wanted stories about failing green energy companies on the CBS Evening News, but then-executive producer Pat Shevlin did not agree.

When told that the stories would be 'pretty significant,' Shevlin retorted, 'What’s the matter, don’t you support green energy?'

Atkisson also claims one of her superiors made it a rule to explicitly label conservatives as such, but that liberals and left-wing analysts were not called out.

Apparently saving the details for the book, Attkisson says a conservative analyst who was far afield of her boss's personal views would be labeled 'right wing' in scripts.

Another issue Attkisson points out is that CBS President David Rhodes has a glaring conflict of interest with the Obama administration, as his brother Ben is Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications.

Nasty emails to Ben and David would apparently be sent when the network aired something distasteful to the administration, according to Attkisson.

CBS reporters have still gone after the Obama administration in the past — a 60 Minutes report from Lara Logan about the unpreparedness of consular security in Benghazi retracted after its primary source was determined to be a fraud.

For Attkisson though, the digging was too little too late, and she left the network in 2014, unsatisfied with what she saw as liberal excuses for the administration's actions.
