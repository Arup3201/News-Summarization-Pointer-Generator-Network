Alvaro Negredo insists he is happy at Manchester City and has no desire to quit the Premier League champions.

The 28-year-old has been consistently liked with a move back to Spain amid suggestions that he has struggled to adapt to life in the north of England. But now the Spaniard, nicknamed 'The Beast', has dismissed such speculation.

'I don’t want to leave City,' he told CityTV, 'I’m very happy and very settled here.

'I had a difficult end to the season and that’s why there has been a lot of talking but I’ve been very happy here from the first day I arrived.'

After a blistering first half to the season that saw the Spain international become a favourite among City fans, the striker picked up a muscle injury that derailed his season.

Edin Dzeko capitalised on his absence as the former Sevilla man continued to struggle with form and fitness, so much so that he failed to make Spain's World Cup squad.

With Atletico Madrid losing Diego Costa to Chelsea, the Spanish champions were keen on bringing Negredo to the Vicente Calderon. However, that now looks unlikely.

When asked whether he was missing life in Spain, Negredo replied: 'No. Maybe a bit more on the personal side than when we talk about football but I don’t cry easily.

'I am sensible but I have to love that person a lot to feel homesick.'
