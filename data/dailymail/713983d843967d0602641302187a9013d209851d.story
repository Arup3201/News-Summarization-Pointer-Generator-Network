A Doberman paralyzed months ago in a freak accident has learned to walk again.

Kenny, believed to be 10-years-old, was unable to move his legs this past April after a metal door was dropped on his neck. Doctors initially advised the dog should be put down, but a team of volunteers had another idea.

Kenny was sent to Two Hand Four Paws, a Los Angeles animal rehabilitation center. Now he is walking, running and playing like any other dog, a volunteer told Huffington Post.

The poor pooch was left paralyzed after a worker at another shelter accidentally dropped the door on his neck, the prognosis for a full recovery was weak.

The owner of the shelter brought the dog to Two Hands Four Paws, founder Leslie McMahon told the site, detailing his strenuous rehab.

‘I took him [Kenny] straight to the neurologist, and she knew we didn't have the roughly $8,000 to do an MRI and surgery,’ Ms McMahon recalled, ‘so she told us to just try rehab to see if we could get him up again.’

The dog was put through a rigorous physical therapy program spanning four hours each day.Activities included having Kenny ‘in the pool, doing massage, laser, acupuncture, assisted standing and assisted walking in the quad cart,’ she added.

Despite stiff limbs that made the process ‘incredibly difficult,’ the team plugged away, she said.Another hurdle encounter by the team was when Kenny lost the ability to pee.

‘[It] became life-threatening, and we actually thought we would lose him because of this,’ Ms McMahon said.

Another group, the Bill Foundation, became aware of the dog’s dire condition and was able to cobble together donations totalling $6,000 in less than one day, the group’s director told Huffington Post.

Kenny was sent for an MRI, and then went into surgery – during which doctors discovered the shocking extent of the damage to Kenny’s spine, and said he might not survive, let alone walk again.

The Doberman’s battle still wasn’t over, as he contracted pneumonia less than a month later.

‘It was scary touch-and-go for a few days,’ but Kenny made it, Ms McMahon told Huffington Post.

Kenny’s rehab went into overdrive when he was finally healthy again.

‘At times we had four people in the pool with him, each one 'walking' a leg to mimic the motion of movement,’ she said. ‘He probably got at least 25 hours of physical therapy a week, including acupuncture.’

Ms McMahon reserved her optimism, but didn’t lose all hope.

‘I rarely see dogs walk again after being down that long. I frankly didn't think we would get this puppy up again,’ she told the site.

Kenny rewarded the team’s tireless efforts when he took his first steps this past July.

Ms McMahon called the determined dog’s recovery a miracle, and said he ‘runs around like a lunatic day in and day out.’

‘He's just a joy to watch,’ she added.

The pooch is currently with a foster home and in need of permanent adoption.
