It is a bloom that has not been seen in London by the public for more than 100 years.

But the sight of a rare white helliborine orchid is one the Queen is able to enjoy - as it is growing in her gardens at Buckingham Palace.

And walking through the 40 acres of land that make up her green oasis, there are countless trees covered in plaques to show they have been planted by kings, queens, emperors, princes and princesses.

The Queen, pictured with The Duke of Edinburgh at one of Buckingham Palace's summer garden parties, has given ITV unprecedented access to the 40 acres of land

Regarded as the Queen's private sanctuary where she is able to relax, and enjoy walking her corgis, the doors have finally been opened to the public through a special two part documentary which will be shown later this month on ITV.

The Palace grounds are only partially opened for the Queen's annual summer garden parties which host up to 7,000 guests.

However for the purposes of the programme, titled The Queen's Gardens, the film crew was given unprecedented access and the cameras are believed to have captured the resident urban foxes, and the Queen's 200,000 honey bees. 

Housed in four hives on a secluded island in the garden's lake to produce honey for the Royal family.

The programme is presented by gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh who was thrilled to stumble upon the white helliborine.

He said: 'This little white flower. It may not seem terribly spectacular but it's the sign of something very exciting. It was found growing here a year ago and before that it hadn't been discovered in London for over a century. 

The garden's 40 acres is enough for 22 football pitches and during her reign Her Majesty has ensured her grounds are a place where nature thrives

'The helliborine orchid, normally a native of chalk woodland, miles away from here, it's a sign that this is one of the richest environments for hundreds of square miles around.'

The garden's 40 acres is enough for 22 football pitches and during her reign Her Majesty has ensured her grounds are a place where nature thrives. 

It now plays host to 350 species of wildflower, 83 species of bird and two and a half thousand British species of insect, including butterflies. The Queen's head chef also uses mulberries from the 50 mulberry trees in the garden, which were planted by King James I.

Mistletoe, hazel catkins and winter jasmine currently fill the beds of the gardens at Buckingham Palace,

Speaking to the Radio Times, Mr Titchmarsh said: 'If you wander off into the undergrowth, you'll find what is probably one of the finest collections of trees and shrubs in the country, including 35 different types of mulberry.

But it's a revelation to see just see how much wildlife there is – amazing bird and insect life and mammals – which for somewhere slap-bang in the middle of the city is unusual.

'I went every month for a year and saw it right the way through the seasons. It's size, scale and scope is much larger than ever you'd imagine – it really is a green lung and oasis in the middle of the city.'

Equipment set up in a similar way to the BBC's popular Springwatch programme – nest-box, infra-red and motion-activated cameras, will reveal the types of wild flowers that bloom to fill the Queen's garden with colour and show how 50 species of bird, including kingfishers and woodcock, visit throughout the year.

The Queen has a team of gardeners who ensure the grounds are beautifully maintained, and each Monday she is presented with a posy of what is growing.

Explains Mr Titchmarsh: 'The gardeners are quite cagey talking about what the Queen likes, but what becomes quite evident is she loves what we would call English cottage garden flowers – unostentatious flowers, not things that are too exotic.

'She has a little posy cut for her every Monday, which is placed on her desk for when she arrives back from Windsor. It will typically have six or seven different types of flowers from the garden to give her a little snapshot of what's looking good at that time.'

Titchmarsh added that the Queen is 'very much involved with major changes', saying: 'The summer garden parties were always in July, but now they have been moved slightly earlier to June that means adjusting the planting scheme to make the borders brighter earlier. 

'She would be consulted about that sort of thing.'
