British buyers are snapping up entire villages in Spain for a fifth of the price of the average semi-detached home here.

Property bargain-hunters are making the most of Spain's economic crisis to buy homes locals can no longer afford to keep.

Most of the tiny villages have been in the hands of the same families for generations, but in many cases their inhabitants have moved away to urban areas and the houses have fallen into disrepair.

Bargain: Briton Neil Christie snapped up the entire Spanish village of Arrunada for just £39,000

DIY: Mr Christie has had to completely rebuild some of the houses in his village

Ghost towns: Many of the villages in rural Spain have been abandoned after families moved away and couldn't afford to maintain the properties

Unable to afford to maintain or restore them, they are being sold at knockdown prices.

Estate agents say 80 per cent are being bought by foreigners - and a third of buyers are British.

Father-of-two Neil Christie bought the hamlet of Arrunada in an idyllic corner of rural north west Spain for just 45,000 euros - or £39,000.

That is just a fifth of the price of the average semi-detached house in Britain, at £201,427, according to the most recent Land Registry statistics.

Even after he has totally renovated the four dilapidated properties, he expects to have spent no more than £140,000 on the project.

Former ITV transmission controller Mr Christie, 61, fell in love with the area while holidaying with his Peruvian wife Rosa.

Scenic: Mr Christie and his wife Rosa will be able to enjoy amazing views once the main house is finished

Economic crisis: Around 80 per cent of properties like this are sold to foreign buyers as Spain struggles financially, estate agents said

The couple have moved from their former home in Cumbria and are now staying in a 
nearby village where Mrs Christie works as a schoolteacher, while Mr 
Christie spends his time renovating their future home.

He said the work has not been a 
project 'for the faint hearted' and that the main house had no roof and a
tree growing in the living room when he arrived.

But he has no regrets about investing in the village.

'Apart from when I’m running out of tea bags there’s absolutely ­nothing
I miss,' he told the Sunday People. 'The work I did in England could be very stressful. I found it 
difficult to relax at times.

'Here I’ve got zero pollution, fresh air and fresh water and I haven’t had to bankrupt myself to get it.'

Specialist estate agents are selling the abandoned villages from £53,000 to £385,000.

Buyers
tend to be middle class couples in their 50s or 60s looking for 
somewhere for their retirement, said estate agent Rafael Canales.

Ruins: Some of the villages are cheap to buy but would take considerable work to make habitable

In need of renovation: The village of Pena Bella is on the market for £53,000

His business partner Pepe Rodil said Spanish families were selling up because they no longer had the money to maintain the properties and because who had moved away to towns and cities saw returning to the countryside as 'a backwards step'.

He said: 'Foreigners are filling 
the gap. I’m happy to see villages which were falling down being 
renovated. It makes me sad to see them in ruins.'

Even the most expensive village on 
the pair's books, El Costal, has a price tag of £385,000 - or to put it 
another way, £10,000 less than the average London flat.

The five-property village needs minimal renovation work and comes with 60 acres of land and amazing views.

Resale prices of homes in the right 
location can be considerable. One village of five houses Mr Rodil 
renovated 13 years ago and turned into a tourist complex is now on the 
market for £1.4million.

Finished project: The formerly abandoned village of Teixois is now a tourist complex
