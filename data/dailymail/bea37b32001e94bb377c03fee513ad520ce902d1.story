Most parenting advice says you don't have to worry if your baby doesn't start speaking until around 18 months. 

But that won't be an issue for Toni and Paul McCann from Ireland whose adorable son Cillian said his first word at just seven weeks old. 

The tiny tot, who is now nine weeks old, was filmed by his 36-year-old mother who says that she knew he had been trying to communicate for a while. 

In an adorable video, filmed by his mother Toni, Cillian McCann, then seven weeks old says his first word

Cillian has three older sisters, Toni revealed that her little girls, Sophie (bottom right), Eva (bottom left) and Ellie (top), did not start talking at such an early age  

Toni said: 'He was trying to speak for a while but that day I knew he was trying to say something.

'I'd read that babies communicate from a young age and to give them space to answer when you talk to them. 

'That was I was doing that day and because he was so alert and making such good eye contact I decided to video him. You can tell my total shock when he came out with "hello".'

In the short clip, Cillian can be seen moving his mouth around trying to talk. After making several attempts he eventually comes out with his first word.  

Toni, who has three older daughters Sophia 12, Ellie, 11 and Eva, eight, said that she knew other people would be shocked when they saw the film.

In the video Cillian is seen struggling to get his word out, but with a bit of encouragement from his mother he finally says hello

She said: 'If I hadn't have videoed it I'm sure people wouldn't have believed me. I don't think I would have believed it myself! 

'After that he said it again to my daughter Eva although it wasn't as clear. When he has been focused and interacting with me since that day I have been telling him "I love you" and I can see he is trying to copy that!

'I have three older girls and never experienced this with them although I think I probably just talked "at" them and didn't give them space to respond.'

Toni says that Cillian was very alert from a young age and had been trying to make out words since he was just five weeks old.

Toni said she is pleased that her little boy, pictured with his sisters Sophia, (left) Eva, (middle) and Ellie (right), can bring so much joy to the world

She said: 'He loves his sisters but from a very young age he always responded most positively to interaction from his dad, my husband Paul. 

'From about five weeks old his little tongue would stick out when his dad was talking to him. I realise now he was trying to talk because that's what he does in the video.'

And people have been very impressed by their talented son. 'People's reaction has been so lovely,' said Toni. 

'Lots of people have said it brightened their day. Lots of people say they can't stop watching it. A girl I know said it is a perfect example of the love between mother and child!

'Some people don't believe it's real, that it's been edited but on the whole most people love it. That is really lovely for me as there is so much bad in the world it's great that my wee son is spreading some joy.'
