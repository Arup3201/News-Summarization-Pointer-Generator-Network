Mark Hynes says it took bungling officers over a fortnight to check CCTV footage, which proved they had the wrong man

A disabled man with a severe limp was wrongly arrested and jailed for over two weeks after he was accused of robbing a betting shop - and running off.

Mark Hynes - who also wears a catheter - told police his disability made it impossible to clamber onto the counter and make a quick getaway.

But he says it took bungling officers over a fortnight to check CCTV footage, which proved they had the wrong man.

In that time, Mr Hynes, 37, had been hauled before a court and even remanded in custody for two and a half weeks at HMP Winchester.

He was accused of threatening staff with a knife at Corals in Leigh Park, Havant, Hampshire.

He is now demanding an apology and compensation from the police, saying people living near his Leigh Park home have 'turned on him'.

Officers have since arrested another suspect.

Mr Hynes was at home when officers came round to search his premises following the robbery.

He was wrongly identified as the culprit and - after appearing at Portsmouth Magistrates' Court - was sent to prison while officers investigated further.

He said prison exacerbated his ill health and has caused problems with his catheter.

He added: 'It's affected my life. Everyone in Leigh Park thinks I'm an armed robber.

'I've got a catheter because I've got urine problems. I limp up the road.

'I couldn't have carried out a robbery but one of the police officers said it was me.'

Mr Hynes claims it took police officers two weeks to check the CCTV properly.

It was then that it became clear Mr Hynes was not a suspect.

He added: 'My arrest came out of the blue - it was the last thing I expected.

'I've lost two and a half weeks of my life because of this.'

A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said at the time of Mr Hynes arrest: 'A man entered the premises and showed a knife to a member of staff before asking him to put money in a bag.

'The suspect then climbed onto the counter and took the money himself.

'He left the scene in the direction of Havant town centre.'

A spokesman for the force today said: 'Police can confirm a 37-year-old man from Havant was arrested on suspicion of robbery.

'He was charged with one count of robbery on a 29-year-old man at a betting shop in Havant on January 30, 2013.

'The charge was later withdrawn.

'An investigation is continuing into the robbery.

'A 28-year-old man from Havant was arrested in London. He is now on police bail pending further enquiries.

'Hampshire Constabulary received a formal complaint from the 37-year-old man initially arrested and charged with robbery.

'The circumstances surrounding the complaint are the subject of a separate investigation by the force.'
