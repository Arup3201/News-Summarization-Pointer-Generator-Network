A deaf football team who finished their season on a record low of minus six points have blamed their poor run on not being able to hear the referee's whistle.

Birmingham Deaf FC crashed to last place in their division during a catastrophic 2013-14 campaign which saw them lose all but one of their 26 fixtures.

After 
finishing 21 points behind their nearest rivals at the foot of the division, players have said match officials contributed to their torrid season.

Birmingham Deaf FC who slumped to bottom of their local league this season amid complaints they couldn't hear the referee's whistle

The squad - made up mainly of deaf players - said they couldn’t hear the referee’s commands and kept on playing when the game was stopped.

They complained that their requests for flags to be used by officials to signal any stoppages were ignored.

Club secretary Guy Whieldon, 26, who is himself deaf, said: 'Most lads feel officials are not geared-up for a deaf team due to communication breakdowns, which cause difficulty.

'The referees are supposed to wave flags while, at the same time, blowing a whistle. Most referees forget to wave or simply don’t want to use a flag.

'It was mainly due to poor commitment from our lads as the average age of the team was 22 and our oldest player is 30.

'We wanted to start in division seven and learn, but the AFA decided to put us in division five. Also, we have 36 players on our books.'

The club face relegation to two leagues below their current position after they finished on minus six points

Mr Whieldon added: 'Half came to play and the side was different for every fixture. We played in the Birmingham AFA to raise our standards for deaf fixtures. Currently, I have no idea if we’ll continue in the league, that depends on the lads.'

The team's disastrous season saw them on the receiving end of 6-0, 10-0, 9-0, 11-0, 7-0 and 15-0 drubbings.

They shipped 164 goals and only scored 27 in one of the worst records in the history of the Birmingham AFA Saturday League.

A player from Red Star Galaxy, who beat BDFC 4-2 and 9-3, said his team did feel for the deaf players, who would carry on after the referee's whistle blew.

The team also competes in the English Deaf Football North League and cup but say referees in their current league were reluctant to use flags

Opposition players said the deaf team found it hard to hear the referee's stoppages

He added: 'They would just carry on running with the ball whenever their was a stoppage. When the half time whistle blew they knew nothing about it.

'You
 had to grab them and point at the ref, it was difficult. They had a few
 good players but obviously communication was a big problem - between 
each other and the ref.'

BDFC, based at Birmingham City University’s pitches, were deducted nine points for failing to turn up for three games.

League organisers may now move them down two leagues because of their showing this season.

A league official said refereeing with a flag had proved unpopular among 
officials and said: 'Three or four did it, but it was not something 
that came naturally. They prefer the whistle.'

The official added: 'We were told they had three players in the national deaf team, but it soon became apparent they were out of their depth.'

The club, set up in 1921, also competes in the English Deaf Football North League and Cup.
