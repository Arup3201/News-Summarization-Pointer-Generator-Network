Fourth seed David Ferrer became the first top-10 man to go out of the US Open in a third-round loss to France's Gilles Simon.

Ferrer, whose relentlessness is legendary, really struggled in hot and humid conditions in New York and went down 6-3 3-6 6-1 6-3.

Having made 10 straight grand slam quarter-finals, the 32-year-old has now failed to get past the third round at the last two.

It was an overdue big win at a slam for the talented Simon, whose only previous appearance in the fourth round at Flushing Meadows came in 2011, when he lost to John Isner.

Ferrer said: 'It was a tough match today. There is a lot of humidity, very sunny, and it was not easy for me. 

'I was not good with my fitness. He was better.'
