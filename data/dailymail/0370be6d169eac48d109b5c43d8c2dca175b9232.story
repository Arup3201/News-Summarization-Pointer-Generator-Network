Kendall Jenner has been photographed posing with Lexi Boling, one of the models accused of 'bullying' her on Instagram.

The backstage snap, taken on Monday after the pair walked together in the Donna Karan show, was taken shortly before Lexi, along with fellow model Binx Walton, left cruel comments on a pre-show image shared on Vogue Germany's Instagram feed.

Lexi, 21, tagged her friend Binx, 20, in the comment: '@binxwalton she's never looked better,' with a crying with laughter emoticon.

Frenemies? Kendall Jenner pictured after the Donna Karan show with Lexi Boling, the rival model who 'bullied' her with 'cruel' comments on a behind-the-scenes Instagram snap

Bullied: Kendall's fellow models left cruel comments on this photo shared on the Vogue Germany Instagram feed, taken backstage before Monday's Donna Karan show at New York Fashion Week

Teen Vogue cover star Binx replied: 'That's f****d up,' with the same animated laughing face. 

The two comments have since been deleted from the Vogue Germany photo, but followers' horrified responses remain.

Lexi has since apologized for the comment. In a statement issued via a representative to E! News, she said: 'I wasn't thinking and made a silly comment. Kendall's had a killer NYFW. A big congrats to her!'   

The latter remark is certainly true. Kendall is unarguably New York Fashion Week's most in-demand catwalk star.

Over the past week, Kendall has hit the runway for Oscar de la Renta, Alexander Wang, Michael Kors, Marc by Marc Jacobs, Vera Wang, Donna Karan and Diane von Furstenberg - a line-up most models can only dream of. 

But this is not the first time Kendall's fellow models have been accused of bullying the Keeping Up With The Kardashians beauty.

A source told Hollywoodlife.com: 'Kendall is constantly being bullied by other models. They feel like she walks around — acting entitled — like she's better than everyone else. She hasn't had to earn her career like everyone else — it was handed to her because of her family connection.  

'They also don't think she has the looks to be such a big model. She's easily the most disliked model on all the catwalks.' 

The source alleges that some models are even playing pranks on Kendall backstage.

Storming the runways of New York Fashion Week, Kendall has just been killing it.  One of her first runways to walk was Marc Jacobs in 2012 and now she's back and fiercer than ever.  This time she's rocking an plush sapphire blue fur coat over a matching fuzzy turtleneck sweater and lace skirt.  We love the entire look but know that the most wearable piece that all the buyers are going to get is that sweater.

With the kind of winters we've been getting, this luxurious sweater will be a must have - whether apres ski or urban hiking to the mall.  Pair it like the runway with a lace skirt for a night out or just throw on some jeans underneath for the perfect model-off-duty look.

Sadly, since this is runway, this Marc Jacobs sweater will not be available until fall 2015!  However, find similarly hued sweaters from Marc Jacobs at farfetch or check out the choices we have found to an instant wardrobe update.

'The other models like to pull cruel pranks on her . . . like hiding her favorite hairspray and make-up,' they told the site.

'They also like to lead her on a wild goose chase by telling her someone was looking for her in her dressing room just before she's supposed to take the stage. It's very catty and mean spirited.' 

In the past, Kendall has denied being bullied by her fellow models. 

She told Dazed magazine in November last year: '[Bullying] has never happened, ever. I would see rumours of girls bullying me backstage and putting cigarettes out in my drink, and none of that has happened. Everyone's been really cool to me. I've never had one girl be mean... so far.'
