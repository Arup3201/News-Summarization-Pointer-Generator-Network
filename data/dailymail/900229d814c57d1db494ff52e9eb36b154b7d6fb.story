British people are becoming more and more sleep deprived - and it's all down to bringing laptops and tablets into the bedroom.

According to a new survey, bingeing on TV box sets is now our top 'lights on' bedroom activity with 34 per cent delaying much-needed kip just to watch their favourite shows.

As a nation our average bed time is 10.43pm, but we're busy for nearly an hour (52 minutes) before we actually go to sleep, according to new research.

Binge-watching box sets is number one sleep-stealers with 34 per cent watching DVDs in bed

The survey of 1,000 adults, which excluded sex as an option, found that binge-watching DVDs or streamed programmes from the internet is now the number one sleep-stealer.

Checking social media feeds was still a high second at 30 per cent, followed by writing emails or working (17 per cent), online shopping (11 per cent) and reading at just four per cent. 

Guilty pleasures such as eating biscuits, having a cuppa away from the rest of the family and playing addictive games like Candy Crush also sneaked into the top answers in a poll by The Fine Bedding Company.

Although 83 per cent questioned claimed to love sleep, and that it was more important to them than food (66 per cent), we're actually getting less and less every year. 

According to the survey, the average amount of sleep is now six hours 28 minutes, compared to our grandparents' generation who got a good eight hours every night.

Although 56 per cent of us claim to be unsatisfied with the amount of sleep we have every night, but we can't seem to tear ourselves away from our favourite shows. Some respondents admitting that it was all too easy to press play again and miss out on beauty sleep.

A minority will enjoy a snack in bed and a moment alone, while one per cent of us admit Candy Crush keeps them awake in bed when they should have turned their lights out

1. Internet TV/streaming/box sets 34%

2. Checking Facebook/social media 31%

3. Working/emails/accounts 17%

4. Online shopping/browsing/magazines 11%

5. Reading Kindle/books/mags 4%

6. Drinking/eating/snacks/treats 1.2%

7. Playing online games/gambling 1.2% 

It seems there is also a male/female divide when it comes to going to bed times, with the majority of men questioned saying they go to bed between 11pm and midnight, but most women were already snuggled up an hour earlier between 10 and 11pm.

Sara Wadsworth of The Fine Bedding Company said: 'It seems we are becoming a nation of binge-watchers, unable to wait another week for the next episode. 

'Perhaps it's time to bring a bit of balance back into the bedroom and try some sleep-enhancing activities a few nights a week. Instead of switching on a screen; try some gentle yoga stretches, listening to soothing music or even meditating. 

'There are lots of apps available designed to enhance sleep and can easily be listened to in bed, putting that mobile phone to good use.'
