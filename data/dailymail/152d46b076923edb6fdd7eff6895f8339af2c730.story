At first the scene looks pretty professional with two rowing boats plowing through the water.

But by the three-second mark, it becomes clear that one of the teams is veering massively off course.

Lo and behold, the female rowers speed forward and crash into the pier where Ms O’Shaughnessy is stood.

A couple of the girls seem to plunge overboard as they hit a run of wooden posts.

'It's OK girls, keep going, get to the line!' one woman is heard yelling.

The next catastrophe occurs moments later, when a boat gets lodged in a reed bed and has to seek assistance.

Standstill: When the clock hits one-minute, two boats are seen stationary in the middle of the course after getting in each other's way

Go, go, go: Frustrated bystanders start yelling in a bid to get the race going again

Long-winded: Finally there is some movement but more crashes follow and a traffic jam develops

Close encounter: Here two boats hit each other as they struggle to make it downstream 

Then when the clock hits one-minute, two boats are seen stationary in the middle of the course after getting in each other's way.

Frustrated bystanders start yelling in a bid to get the race going again, However, neither party seems willing to budge.

Finally there is some movement, but more crashes follow and a traffic jam develops. 

'If you don't know how to row don't row,' one woman shouts from the water's edge, while another simply adds: 'Just move, move!'

Ms O’Shaughnessy said there was a victor in the race but she didn't continue videoing to that point. To date the video titled Snowflake Regatta Carnage has scored more than 490,000 hits online. 

One veteran rowing coach who witnessed the race, told the Riverhead News Review that viewers shouldn't be too harsh on the rowers as these sort of mishaps happen often during novice events.
