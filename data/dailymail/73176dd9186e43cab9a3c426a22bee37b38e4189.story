Kevin Mitchell has been handed home advantage for his second crack at a world title against Jorge Linares.

Mitchell will face the WBC champion at the O2 Arena on May 30 as part of a world-title double-header.

Featherweight Lee Selby will challenge for the IBF title against Evgeny Gradovich while heavyweight Anthony Joshua will also be in action against Kevin Johnson.

Mitchell became the mandatory challenger for Linares' belt by beating Daniel Estrava in January.

The 30-year-old from Dagenham previously challenged Ricky Burns in 2012 but was stopped in the fourth round. He also lost to Michael Katsidis for the interim WBO title at Upton Park two years earlier.

Last year, Mitchell beat Ghislain Maduma at Wembley but was not installed as the IBF's mandatory challenger after failing to make the check weight on the day of the fight.

Promoter Eddie Hearn told Sky Sports News: 'Kevin Mitchell is one of the most talented fighters in British boxing; he's also one of the most likable.

'Sometimes it takes longer to achieve what you want but I believe it's perfect timing for him to finally fulfill his dream and become WBC champion of the world.'

Lee Selby earned his mandatory spot for the IBF featherweight title by beating Joel Brunker last year

Selby, meanwhile, has been waiting since October for his world title shot after stopping the previously unbeaten Joel Brunker in the ninth round.

Gradovich has held the IBF strap since 2013 and has won 19 of his 20 fights, drawing the other.

Hearn added: 'Since Lee joined up with us he's been punch perfect. He's the favourite in the fight which shows you what people think of him.

'I believe he can go on and become a great of British boxing.'

Joshua had been due to face Johnson in January but was forced to withdraw with a back injury. The Olympic champion is also in action on April 4 in Newcastle.
