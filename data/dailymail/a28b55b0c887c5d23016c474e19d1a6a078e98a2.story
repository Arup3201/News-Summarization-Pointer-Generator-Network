Junior dos Santos is desperate to put his 14 months of injury hell behind him with a devastating performance against Stipe Miocic.

The former heavyweight champion takes on Miocic in the five-round main event in Phoenix, Arizona on Saturday night.

Dos Santos has struggled with a hand injury since losing to current champion Cain Velasquez last October.

'That last year was a tough year for me,' he admitted to Sportsmail. 'Since my last fight in October last year, everything has been hard. But it was a good time to be thinking about everything – what’s happening in my life and my career. To try to do something better for me, to take care of me, to take care of my body and get better results.

'But right now I'm happy. I will be competing again so that’s everything that I want - to be in the Octagon, to be doing what I love to do.'

The Brazilian, ranked No 2, believes victory will set him up for another shot at the title. 

'My main objective in my career is to be the champion again,' he added. 'I really believe I can. I'm just trying to be stronger mentally, to put everything in the right place right now in my career, and have the same desire to win that I always had. The win against Miocic is going to put me in the line to fight for the title again.

'I think Miocic is in a very good moment of his career. He’s coming from really good victories. He’s a good wrestler. But all the time he tries to use his boxing skills. I really believe Miocic is going to try to strike against me, to stand up with me. If that happens, he’s going to get knocked out. I really think it’s going to be very interesting for the fans and I cannot wait to put on a good show for them.'

Miocic, meanwhile, has won his last three fights and is a former amateur boxing champion and nationally ranked wrestler.

He said: 'I'm going to get that win no matter what, I don’t really care how it happens, whether it’s a decision, knockout or submission I really don’t care, I'm just going to get that win.

'Dos Santos is the best of the best, he’s ranked second in the world, he’s a former champ. He hits hard and he moves well but I'm ready for that come Saturday. I have the best coaches in the world and I’ll be confident walking in there.'
