I haven't killed him, have I? Raymond Dupree allegedly stabbed great-nephew Ryan King, pictured, who died at his mother's birthday party

A former boxer who killed his great-nephew by stabbing him in the neck with a wine glass told police it was ‘just a family fall-out’, a court has heard.

Raymond Dupree slashed Ryan King’s throat, severing his jugular vein, after a row broke out during a family birthday party at a country mansion.

The 68-year-old only realised what he had done when he heard Mr King’s mother screaming, ‘No, no, not my baby’ in hospital, the court was told.

He then turned to the policeman guarding him and said: ‘Oh for ****’s sake, I haven’t killed the b***er have I? I did not mean to do that.

'I did not mean to hurt him.’

The jury at Exeter Crown Court heard how Dupree and Mr King, 20, were guests at the Snurridge Manor House, near South Molton in north Devon, in August last year. 

The house, which is owned by Bernadette Soton, Dupree’s sister and Mr King’s grandmother, is  normally rented out for exclusive country house parties. 

However, that night it was being used to celebrate the 40th birthday of Mrs Soton’s daughter Lisa  Wilson, Mr King’s mother.

She was pregnant at the time.

The court heard how a row broke out at around 3am after Dupree began yelling at a group of teenagers who were still up and playing music.

After being confronted by Mr King, Dupree is alleged to have picked up a wine glass from the kitchen table before smashing it into the younger man’s neck.

Mr King was taken to the North Devon District Hospital in Barnstaple, where Dupree was also treated for a cut to his hand caused by the breaking glass.

Mr King’s family sobbed in the public gallery yesterday as they heard about the moment when his mother was told he had died.

PC Graham Janes said that he found Dupree in a country lane next to Snurridge House after officers were called.

He
said: ‘I noticed a man walking towards me with blood splats on his 
clothing and blood dripping from his hand. When I shone a torch at him 
he swore at me. He said “What are you being like that for? It was just a
family fall-out”.’

After 
being arrested and cautioned on suspicion of causing grievous bodily 
harm, it is claimed Dupree then told PC Janes: ‘I  ain’t denying it 
anyway. I hit him. I hit the boy. I think I’ve got more  of a cut than 
he has.’

PC Janes told the court: ‘I asked if he 
had consumed alcohol and he said he’d had a bottle of rosé. I did not 
think he was drunk. He could stand without assistance and was not 
slurring his speech. While we were at hospital we heard screaming coming
from an adjacent room. A woman was screaming “No, no, not my baby. It’s
not happening, it’s not happening”.

‘He responded “Oh for ****’s sake. I haven’t killed the b***er have I? I did not mean to do that. I didn’t mean to hurt him. I’m so sorry. Do you think it’s fatal? My nephew, my niece, oh ****ing hell.”’

‘Later he was told he was being arrested for murder and replied “I’m so sorry. This will be the end of me. How can I ever speak to my family again?” He had his head in his hands.’

Dupree, of Bishop’s Nympton, near South Molton, denies murder, claiming it was an accident. The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
