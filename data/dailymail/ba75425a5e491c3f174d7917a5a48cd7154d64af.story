The homeless older brother of billionaire pop star Madonna required nine stitches to his forehead after he resisted arrest in a public bathroom in northern Michigan, police revealed Tuesday.

Law enforcement officials were called in Sunday night when 56-year-old Anthony Ciccone refused to leave the bathroom at the Grand Traverse County Civic Center.

Police say a female officer attempted to arrest Ciccone on an outstanding warrant for trespass, but he showed resistance.

In response, the responding police officer brought the unruly 56-year-old man to the ground. As a result, Ciccone's face hit the bathroom floor.

He was taken to Munson Medical Center, where he received several stitches.

Police say at the time of his arrest, Ciccone's blood-alcohol level was 0.40, which is five times the legal limit in Michigan. No attorney is listed for Ciccone, who was arraigned on the warrant and jailed.

Madonna's publicist, Liz Rosenberg, declined to comment. Madonna is a Michigan native.

Police received a 911 call at around 11pm Sunday reporting that a man was refusing to leave a detached bathroom and challenged a cleaning crew at the Grand Traverse County Civic Center on West Civic Center Drive.

Traverse City Police Capt Brian Heffner told the Traverse City Record-Eagle that Madonna’s 56-year-old sibling confronted the responding officer in an aggressive manner when she attempted to restrain and arrest him on an outstanding trespassing warrant.

'She turned him around and brought him to the ground, which is when he struck his face on the bathroom floor,' Heffner said.

According to authorities, the warrant stemmed from a March incident when Ciccone was reclining in front of a fireplace at Horizon Books and refused to leave. 

Ciccone was arraigned Monday on the trespassing warrant and ordered held without bond in the Grand Traverse County Jail.

Anthony, the oldest of the seven living Ciccone siblings, has been living on the streets for the past three years, during which time he had several run-ins with the law.

He recently spent a month in jail after being arrested drunk in a church and swearing in front of children.

Recently, the 56-year-old homeless man suffering from an alcohol addicito9n told MailOnline that his glamorous 54-year-old sister, whose net worth stands at $1billion, does not care if he is dead or alive.

'I never loved her in the first place, she never loved me. We never loved each other,' her told MailOnline in an interview last week.

Anthony Ciccone lost his job at the family vineyard owned by his father, Tony, and his stepmother, Joan, after being found sprawled on his back drinking wine straight from the vats.

'My father would be very happy if I died of hypothermia and then he would not have to worry about it anymore. He’s old school, he grew up in the depression,' the 56-year-old said.

However, a family friend who works at the Ciccone vineyard claims that Anthony's parents are terrified that he might die any day, but refuse to take him back until he cleans up his act and quits drinking.

Giving his version of why he was sacked, he said:  'I planted grapes, I picked grapes, worked my hands in the earth. But I discovered that my father was not particularly fond of me for some reason, he doesn't approve of my friends.

Still, 83-year-old Tony Ciccone reportedly tried to seek out his troubled son to give him leftovers from a Thanksgiving meal, but the 56-year-oild would not accept any help
