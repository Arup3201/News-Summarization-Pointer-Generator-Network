The head of the Republican National Committee has urged GOP officials to avoid appearances on MSNBC because the network posted a Tweet saying that conservatives would be upset by a commercial featuring a biracial family.

The commercial in question is an ad for Cheerios which will run during the Super Bowl, and it will star the same biracial family that was used in one of the company's previous ads.

MSNBC posted a message to Twitter late on Wednesday night that read: 'Maybe the rightwing will hate it, but everyone else will go awww: the adorable new #Cheerios ad w/ biracial family' and then added a link to their story with an embeded version of the ad.

Controversy: The Cheerios ad will air during the Super Bowl and features a white mother, black father, and their daughter. The same cast of actors were featured in a previous ad for the company

Offensive: MSNBC deleted this tweet a short while after posting it late Wednesday night

They quickly took down the Tweet and issued an apology saying that they 'deeply regret it' and that 'it does not reflect the position of msnbc'.

That wasn't enough for RNC chair Reince Priebus, who said that he will no longer be appearing on the network after the tweet, which he said 'is one action in a pattern of noxious behavior'. 

He wrote that the message was just the latest in a 'petty and demeaning attacks on conservatives'.

Priebus has urged other Republicans to avoid the network, where the shows usually lean left.

His boycott caught the attention of network president Phil Griffin who released a statement announcing that they fired a staffer as a result.

'The tweet last night was outrageous and unacceptable. We immediately acknowledged that it was offensive and wrong, apologized, and deleted it,' Griffin said in the statement.

'We have dismissed the person responsible for the tweet.

'I personally apologize to Mr. Priebus and to everyone offended. At MSNBC we believe in passionate, strong debate about the issues and we invite voices from all sides to participate. That will never change.'

Apology: The network followed up with these tweets

Not enough: Reince Priebus is calling for a Republican boycott of the network until they get a public apology from Phil Griffin, MSNBC president

This comes the same day as an interview with Griffin was released on The Daily Beast wherein he defends MSNBC against calls of being too liberal-leaning in their coverage.

'I think we’ve never had an ideology. An ideology is a single thought across all programs. We’ve never had that,' he said.

'Obviously I hire people who fit the sensibility... We do stay true to facts. You have to build your argument. That’s why I call it a sensibility.'

As an example, he said that MSNBC is not a safe haven of sorts for 'troubled' Democrats who may be looking for a cable news show to help rehabilitate their brand.

That said, he said that the same could not be said for Republican rival Fox News.

'I think they do have an ideology, because every Republican who’s in trouble goes on that network to be taken care of....They’re owned by News Corp., which is Rupert Murdoch. Roger Ailes runs it, and he comes out of the Republican Party,' Griffin said.

Priebus isn't the first Republican to question MSNBC's motives in recent weeks, as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie launched a tirade against the channel when they released a report alleging that he threatened to withhold Hurricane Sandy funds if a development deal didn't go through.

'MSNBC is a partisan network that has been openly hostile to Governor Christie and almost gleeful in their efforts attacking him, even taking the unprecedented step of producing and airing a nearly three-minute attack ad against him this week,' his team said in a statement.
