A 20-month-old baby died in hospital after she was prescribed an 'exceptionally high' dose of potassium while recovering from a 'textbook' operation, an inquest was told.

Willow Kemp suffered a heart attack after undergoing a number of procedures, including a gastrostomy, at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.

The inquest heard that medics who were responsible for her care failed to check her blood levels for three-and-half hours as she recovered in the hospital's intensive care unit.

Willow died in June 2012, just moments after her parents, Debbie and Oliver Kemp, had voiced concerns that their daughter appeared to be struggling to breathe, the inquest heard.

The toddler suffered from a number of complex illnesses including cardiac and respiratory problems that meant her potassium levels had previously fluctuated wildly.

In response, a pharmacist prepared a large dose of potassium. He told the inquest that he had never dealt with such high concentrations in his whole career.

But staff admitted that they then did not check Willow's blood levels again for a number of hours, despite the unusually high dosage.

Potassium, a mineral that the body needs to work normally, helps nerves and muscles communicate. It also helps move nutrients into cells and waste products out of cells. 

A normal potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.5millimoles per litre.

However Willow had a history of fluctuating levels - with readings ranging from 1.8 to as high as 8mmol/l being taken in the month before her death.

Willow's first potassium reading on 28 June was of 5.7mmol/l. Shortly after, her parents described her as looking 'peaky' and said she was struggling to breathe as she lay in her mother's arms.

When her father Oliver Kemp, a radio DJ, from Bamber Bridge, Lancashire, alerted the nurse to his daughter's condition, she called a physiotherapist for assistance and her blood gas was taken again.

The test revealed that her potassium level had shot up to 8.3mmol/l and her situation became critical.

The baby slipped into cardiac arrest and, despite frantic attempts to resuscitate her, was pronounced dead a short time later. 

It was later discovered that she had a huge 11mmol/l of potassium in her blood at the time of death.

At an inquest into her death in Manchester yesterday, Mr Kemp broke down in tears as he relived the moment he was told that hyperkalaemia - a high potassium concentration - contributed to his daughter's death.

He said: 'The procedure, we were told, was 'textbook' and she would make a full recovery.

'When we arrived back at the hospital Willow  was in the cot and looked very uncomfortable, her breathing appeared laboured, she had white secretions on her mouth and she appeared to be hot to the touch.

'Before the cardiac arrest my wife was holding Willow on her lap and I was beside her and the consultant came to the cubicle. 

'At that point I decided to ask about what I was seeing on the heart monitor screen. He had come to look at the chart. I said to him 'is that correct, does that look right to you?'

'He looked at her and at the heart monitor and he said something to the effect of, "yes, she does look very peaky, could you please put her back on the bed". 

'We left the cubicle after we gave her a kiss and we knew something was wrong because the voices started to get louder. More members of staff came and we were told she had died.' 

Dr Robert Yates, a consultant paediatrician at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, said Willow's body would deal with potassium differently to anything he had ever seen.

He said: 'This was a little girl who had widely fluctuating levels even when stable and well.

'The concentration and quantity that she received wasn't directly proportional to the potassium in her blood. 

'I have been a consultant for 18 years and have never seen a child with such fluctuating levels of potassium.'

When asked by Andrew Bridgman, representing Willow's family, whether it would be 'prudent' to monitor Willow's levels frequently because of their unusual results, Dr Yates said: 'Yes, but where it was practical to do so, given the other cares for her going on.

'I was happy with them being taken every ninety minutes to two hours and was happy she had previously tolerated a high level of potassium which was outside our normal experience.'

Dr Adam Southern, a senior clinical pharmacist at the hospital, constructed the potassium mixture to be used in the two infusion bags administered to Willow.

He said: 'This is the first time in my professional career I have needed to make a solution like that.'

Staff nurse Stacey Cain, who was responsible for Willow's care on the intensive care unit that day, admitted she should have checked her potassium levels more regularly while such a large amount was being administered.

However, she said she hadn't been given any specific instructions as to how often they should be taken. She said: 'One should be taken every two hours, but circumstances wouldn't allow it.'

Dr Robert Ross-Russell, a consultant paediatrician from Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, was asked by coroner Nigel Meadows to prepare a report on Willow's care as an expert witness.

He said: 'It was an exceptionally high concentration of potassium. I have used it once or twice but never in a child so small in age or in terms of weight. It is an extraordinary situation you are in.

'The decision to move up from 6-12mmol per hour was a bold one and a risky one.

I don't think it was unreasonable to do given the difficulties they had in controlling the potassium but it was a very substantial rise in the amount being given.

'I think my feeling was if one is going to undertake risks they have to be very careful and monitor them.

'There was a need for regular monitoring. When the blood gas was taken at 4.51pm it should have raised significant concern and alarm because it is a substantial jump up.'

He conceded that the registrar's fell below the standard expected as the infusion wasn't immediately stopped and issues weren't raised with the consultant doctor on duty.

Coroner Nigel Meadows earlier acknowledged that the family have received admissions from the NHS trust about the potassium levels - which the family do not accept as going 'far enough' in determining responsibility for Willow's death.

The inquest continues.
