Police in Istanbul have been scanning security camera footage today to try to trace a woman who went missing while vacationing alone in the city, an official said.

Sarai Sierra, 33, from New York City, was last in touch with her family on January 21, the day she was supposed to fly home after two weeks in Turkey.

A police official said authorities were reviewing footage from around Istanbul's Taksim neighborhood - the city's main hub where she was staying at a hostel.

No trace: Sarai Sierra, a 33-year-old mother of two young sons, set off for Istanbul on January 7 and has since vanished. Her family last heard from her on January 21

Eye for detail: Mrs Sierra, a freelance photographer, had gone on the trip to snap photos of the ancient country

Contact: The last time her family heard from her was on January 21

Several police teams have also been 
dispatched to surrounding neighborhoods to find possible clues and 
witnesses, the official said.

He spoke on condition of anonymity, 
in line with government rules that bar civil servants from speaking to 
reporters without prior authorization.

Turkey's private Dogan news agency 
meanwhile, reported that police had established that Sierra had traveled
to Amsterdam, Netherlands, from Istanbul on January 15 and then 
journeyed on to Munich, Germany, on January 16, before returning to 
Istanbul on January 19.

Police were trying to determine the reason for her visit to the European cities, the report said.

Police were also trying to find the identity of a person she had been chatting with on the Internet, Dogan reported.

Before she went missing, the 
mother-of-two told family members that she planned to take some 
photographs at Galata Bridge, a well-known tourist destination about a 
mile away from Taksim that spans the Golden Horn waterway.

She was then supposed to begin traveling home and was scheduled to arrive in New York City on Tuesday afternoon.

Her belongings, including her 
passport and phone, were found in her room. The first police official 
said authorities were therefore not able to track her by her cell phone.

Sierra's husband and brother were 
traveling to Istanbul to follow the search. Her two sons, aged 11 
and nine, do not know their mother is missing, her brother David Jimenez
said on Sunday.

Disappearance: Sarai Sierra had taken pictures in Taksim Square and posted them to her Instagram shortly before she vanished

Sierra had planned to go on the trip 
with a friend but ended up going by herself when the friend couldn't 
make it. She was looking forward to exploring her hobby of photography, 
her family said.

Her husband, Steven Sierra, waited for hours at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey on the 22nd to pick her up. Airline attendants in Turkey said that his wife did not show up for the flight.

‘We just want to find her and get her home safe,’ he told the Staten Island Advance from his home in the Silver Lake neighborhood of the borough yesterday.

The panicked husband also found out 
that his wife’s passport, clothes, phone chargers, and medical cards 
were found in her room at a hostel in Beyoglu, Turkey. The hostel’s 
owner told Turkish authorities that he had last seen her last on Sunday 
night.

Mr Sierra told ABC News that
her behavior is highly unusual, and that the mother to two preteen boys
seemed perfectly content with her life, and going off the radar is 
extremely out-of-character for her.

He
and Mrs Sierra’s brother, David Jimenaz, are scheduled to arrive in 
Turkey by Monday afternoon and will continue their search aided by local
officials. They said that they will also look in hospitals to see if 
Mrs Sierra somehow sustained an injury and was unable to make contact 
with them.

The heartbroken 
husband said that he’s been married to her for more than 14 years, 
adding that his love for her is ‘deeper than it is for any individual'.

He told WABC: ‘You
have so many thoughts going through your mind, you don’t know what to 
think, you don’t know what to believe, you don’t know what to expect, 
you don’t know what will come out of this.’

During her last few days in the Eurasian country, Mrs Sierra planned to head to the Galata Bridge, a well-known tourist destination that spans the Golden Horn waterway, to take some photographs, her mother, Betzaida Jimenez, told the Associated Press.

Crime in Turkey is generally low and Istanbul is a relatively safe city for travelers, though there are areas where women would be advised to avoid going alone at night.

The Galata and the nearby Galata Bridge areas have been gentrified and are home to fish restaurants, cafes and boutiques.

Mrs Sierra's friend, Magalena Rodriguez, told the
New York Daily News that the petite woman, who stands at 5ft2in and 
weighs only 110 pounds, has fainted before without warning.

Ms Rodriguez fears her friend has fainted and could be hurt somewhere in the unfamiliar country.
