With just a month to go until the birth of the most eagerly anticipated baby of the decade all eyes are on Kate - and her wardrobe choices - every time she steps out in public.

And at this weekend's Trooping the Colour ceremony Kate made her last official appearance before the birth of her 
first child looking stunning in pale pink Alexander McQueen
coat with pearl buttons and matching hat. 

But what might she have been wearing underneath that chic outfit? According to celebrity lingerie designer Lorna Drew, it could well have been the stylish blue satin underwear set pictured below.

Lingerie secret: It has been revealed that the Duchess of Cambridge is a huge fan of Lorna Drew maternity lingerie

The designer has revealed that the 31-year-old duchess is a fan of her products.

Lorna, who has dressed the likes of Jessica Simpson, Imogen Thomas, Una Healy and Fearne Cotton during their pregnancies, sent Kate some sexy satin maternity lingerie - and was elated to hear from Kate's people that she was 'delighted' with the garments.

Kate is a fan of the £39 Alexa Blue Satin bra and matching £19 briefs by the designer, who is based in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.

The response from Kate was a lovely ‘thank you for the thoughtful gift’. 

Lorna Drew, the MD of Lorna Drew 
Nursing Lingerie said: 'I know Kate would be feeling pretty dreadful and
thought that she could do with special gift, as nothing makes you feel 
great like beautiful lingerie, so we sent her some!'

Lorna had met Kate back in 2008 before her marriage to the Prince.

Royal choice: Kate is a fan of the £39 Alexa Blue Satin bra and matching £19 briefs by the designer, who describes them as 'elegant and perfect for Kate'

She added: 'Kate’s style is very elegant, she always looks feminine and chic so I knew she would love our nursing bras and knickers.

'I was delighted to bring a smile to Kate’s face after a difficult start to her pregnancy.'

Speaking to the Huffington Post, who 
revealed Kate's lingerie secrets, Lorna said: 'I couldn't believe the 
response we got when we sent Kate the underwear. We actually received an email back from Kate's office saying she was "delighted" with it.

'It's fantastic as the style is elegant and so perfect for Kate.

'Maternity underwear doesn't have to be frumpy.'

Lorna
Drew's website states: 'This beautiful satin nursing bra holds and 
supports to give amazing shape and lift while Brazilian cut briefs give a
fashion edge to this design.

Famous fans: Lorna, who has dressed the likes of Jessica Simpson, Imogen Thomas, Una Healy and Fearne Cotton during their pregnancies, sent Kate some sexy frilly maternity lingerie that Kate was reportedly 'delighted' with

'The stunning colour blocking in silky soft satin looks as good as it feels to wear. Smooth elastic strapping frames the bust and gold adjusters add the finishing touch to this uniquely stylish design.'

Lorna, who aims her lingerie at 'savvy yummy mummies', believes that the pregnant silhouette is something to embrace, so designs all her briefs to sit discreetly under a woman's bump.
