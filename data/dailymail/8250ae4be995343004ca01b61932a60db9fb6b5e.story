Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore has recovered from his summer ordeals to the extent there is now considerable support among top-flight teams for him to be promoted to executive chairman.

The clubs’ meeting on Thursday appointed headhunters Spencer Stuart to help find a successor to city financier Anthony Fry, who is too ill to continue in the role after suffering a stroke.

But the talk before the summit was that as many as 10 clubs, including some of the bigger ones, might back Scudamore’s role being upgraded. And 10 is not far short of the 14-club majority needed for PL changes.

It represents a surprisingly rapid return for Scudamore to his old ‘ringmaster’ influence.

The 55-year-old nearly lost his job in the furore that followed his sexist text exchanges with PL lawyer Nick West. Then in June he had heart surgery, from which he has made a full recovery.

The part-time job England 2018 found for an acquaintance of FIFA rogue Jack Warner during the bidding process, which ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert claims undermined the integrity of the bidding process, turned out to be a work experience position. There is no record the FA even paid the young man for his eight-week stint.

Beleaguered Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said before the Premier League clubs meeting that the troubles at Spurs would easily be remedied by a ‘few wins’. Meanwhile, although English grandees such as Arsenal chairman Sir Chips Keswick and West Ham’s Baroness Brady attend clubs meetings, not one foreign club owner was at Thursday’s London summit.

Alex Horne, the departing FA general secretary, enjoyed an annual salary and bonuses of £528,000, making him the highest paid boss of a sports governing body in the UK. But FA chairman Greg Dyke has no intention of paying Horne’s successor that amount. 

And there is opposition among FA powerbrokers to any contract discussions with Roy Hodgson before Euro 2016. They feel, after the World Cup debacle, the manager should be judged on how England perform in France rather than on the easiest of qualifying tasks.

Qatar’s Africa stitch-up

Hans-Joachim Eckert's report somehow regards England spending £35,000 on the 2010 Caribbean Football Union gala dinner at Jack Warner’s behest as being a bigger breach of FIFA regulations than Qatar forking out £1.15m to endorse the African Confederation (CAF) congress in Angola in 2010. And this despite England 2018 having clearance from FIFA to do so, while nothing was known about Qatar’s huge sponsorship until after the deal was done.

There is no mention that Qatar barred England from presenting to CAF delegates because they had bought exclusive rights to the event.

The Angola summit was also the occasion on which Mohamed bin Hammam made it clear he was helping the Qatari bid, although Eckert claims the cash-for-votes scandal which led to his lifetime ban from football was only to do with his aborted bid for the FIFA presidency.

The world stops for Premier League business, even with FIFA in meltdown. It needed your ever helpful Sports Agenda columnist to inform FA chairman Greg Dyke — when he emerged after three hours stuck in a clubs summit on Thursday — about Michael Garcia’s castigation of his FIFA ethics colleague Hans-Joachim Eckert.

Sir Alex Ferguson was asked at one of his autobiography book events why Sam Allardyce didn’t get a mention and Fergie intimated that Sam wouldn’t be pleased. However, on page one of the updated paperback edition, Fergie writes: ‘Sam Allardyce has become a great pal.’

Jack Warner's most ridiculous demands to the England 2018 team were not included in Hans-Joachim Eckert’s flawed report, in which he gave the strong impression England kowtowed to Warner at every opportunity. 

Certainly they rejected Warner’s request that they pay $1m for Hurricane-torn Haiti’s World Cup TV rights, which was to be paid into the Caribbean Football Union account.
