Coutts –the Queen’s bank owned by RBS - is being investigated by German prosecutors over allegations it helped wealthy clients evade tax in Swiss bank accounts.

The disclosure in RBS's annual results comes as HSBC is mired in controversy over similar claims, with criminal investigations launched in several countries including Switzerland and France.

RBS gave only scant details but said the investigation by German prosecutors into Coutts’ Swiss private banking arm involved current and former staff as well as the Coutts bank itself.

It is already being investigated by the US Department of Justice, and said it expects to reach a settlement later this year.

RBS chief executive Ross McEwan said the growing tax dodging scandal has ‘tarnished the banking industry’, adding that ‘private banks have taken too long to catch up with public expectations’.

He added: ‘I want to be very clear, if we find any evidence on wrongdoing we will come down incredibly hard. It’s just not the type of behaviour we’ll have in our organisation.’

RBS is looking to sell the international arm of Coutts to focus on its wealthy UK clients.

The reputation of Coutts, whose well-heeled client list includes the Queen, is already tarnished.

It was fined almost £9million for laundering money for suspected criminals and foreign despots by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority in 2012.

It has also been forced to set aside millions of pounds to compensate UK customers mis-sold investments.
