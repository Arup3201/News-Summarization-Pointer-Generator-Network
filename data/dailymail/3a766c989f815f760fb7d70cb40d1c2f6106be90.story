Shannon Turner said the man approached her as she was bringing in her groceries from her car 

One of Turner's neigbours captured this mobile phone image of the alleged suspect who fled from the scene 

The man ran off through a neighbour's back garden before fleeing into some nearby woods 

Turner told CBS46: 'I came out of my kitchen to get the rest of my groceries. When I got to my front door, he was coming up the path fast and came into my house.'

Chillingly, the man did not say a word and instead placed his index finger over his lips indicating that Turner should remain silent. 

She said: 'I was very scared. I realised what was happening. We fought, he just kept trying to push me in the house. He grabbed my face, pushed me back, grabbed my shoulder punched me in the face and was choking me.'

The attacker escaped through a neighbour's back garden and was chased off into some nearby woods at gunpoint. 

He is described as being 'at least 6'2, olive skin, curly blonde hair, clean, physically fit, not hideous, slim and strong'. 

Turner said the man attacked her in the middle of the day and she wanted to warn others abou thet presence of the predator. 

Turner said: 'I don't want this man to get away with raping someone. He needs to be off the street' 

The man approached Turner at her home on Glendale Avenue in Georgia, pictured, before running off 

She told Channel 2: 'I froze for a minute then I realised, "Oh my gosh! This is happening". 

'He grabbed me, punched me in the face. He grabbed me at my neck, really hard on my neck, and then back this way and he was trying to cover my mouth because I immediately started screaming, "911! Call the police".

'I fought him. I knew, don't let him get you further into the house. Don't let that be the next location. You've gotta be seen and heard. I don't want this man to get away with raping someone. He needs to be off the street. He needs to be caught.'

Turner confirmed that the man captured on mobile phone footage was the same man who allegedly attacked her.
