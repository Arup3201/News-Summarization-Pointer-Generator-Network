A rare Javan Gibbon has survived the first few months of life thanks to dedicated zoo staff who continue to care for him around the clock.

The male Gibbon named 'Owa', which means gibbon in Indonesian, was born on June 20 but has had to be reared by Perth Zoo keepers six days after his birth when it became clear that mother, 'Hecla' wasn't producing enough milk to sustain her infant.

Primate supervisor, Holly Thompson, said the zoo has a good track record after already successfully hand-reared four white-cheeked Gibbons - but Owa is their first Javan Gibbon.

'It is difficult to rear a primate and introduce it back to its family, so it's not something we took on lightly,' she said.

'Life has become a blur of nappies, milk formula and sleepless nights and our veterinary department now features a portacot, having been turned into a temporary nursery - it's certainly a labour of love.'

Tipping the scales at a healthy 860g, Owa is currently having six bottle feeds a day and has just started tucking into mashed fruit and vegetables.

Owa visits his mother and father, Jury, and four-year old sister ,Sunda, at least twice a day. 

The staff are very protective of the little fella and it is anticipated that he will return to his family once he is old enough and weaned off his milk feeds.

Owa is Hecla’s tenth offspring and along with her mate Jury, the animals are the world’s most successful known breeding pair of Javan Gibbons.

Perth Zoo is responsible for the coordination of the Studbook for this unique species which involves updating the international studbook for Javan Gibbon and advising on suitable breeding and genetics for this species throughout Australasia.

Javan Gibbons, also known as Silvery Gibbons are Java’s last remaining ape and are endangered due to habitat destruction and the pet trade. 

Surveying techniques of wild Javan Gibbons is difficult but it is suspected there are less than 2000 remaining in the wild. 

Over 98 per cent of their original habitat has been destroyed for the growing population of Java that was recorded at 141 million people in 2012.

Perth Zoo supports the work of Silvery Gibbon Project through its Wildlife Conservation Action fundraising program. 

The Silvery Gibbon Project assists with releasing gibbons into West Java’s Mt Malabar and educates the local community about the importance of habitat preservation and gibbon conservation. 

This year Perth Zoo’s Wildlife Conservation Action program assisted the Silvery Gibbon Project to protect land in Indonesia where gibbons and Siamang live naturally.
