A new pop-up store in Manhattan will sell its products for the price of a post to any social media account. 

The Velcro Brand Holiday Hackshop has declared Monday, December 15, its 'Social Currency Day,' when customers can pay for select items with 'retweets, posts and more' in which the brand is mentioned.

Though the company is still determining exactly what they will be 'selling' based on stock, a representative told MailOnline the products will be worth around $5 each.

Welcome to the Hackshop! Velcro Brand is hoping to get more followers on social media sites by running a holiday pop-up shop in lower Manhattan where customers are encouraged to post about their experience

Will you Tweet for these? On Monday, December 15, customers can pay for select Velcro Brand products by posting to social media sites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter 

Items customers can potentially buy include garland ties, holiday decor wrap and adhesive fabric strips. 

To further encourage social media activity, the store is offering daily giveaways for customers who post about it on Instagram, with prizes like eBooks, one-night stays at resorts and kitchen appliances.

The shop will also be offering free gift wrapping and photos with Santa, DIY craft stations and special events throughout its run.  

The boutique, which is located at 199 Lafayette Street in New York's trendy Soho neighborhood, will be open every day through December 19 from 8 am to 8 pm. 

Enter to win! The brand is giving away a prize every day to one lucky winner who posts about the brand on Instagram

This is made of what? All of the decor at the pop-up shop - including these lamps - was made using Velcro Brand products. 

Velcro, which was invented in 1948, is hoping to shed its image as a product strictly for fastening, according to the company's publicist.

To ramp up its efforts, Velcro Brand recently enlisted HGTV star Sabrina Soto as its spokesperson for the next two years.

Though the product has been a household fixture since it was introduced commercially in the 1950s, the company didn't launch its first e-store until earlier this year.
