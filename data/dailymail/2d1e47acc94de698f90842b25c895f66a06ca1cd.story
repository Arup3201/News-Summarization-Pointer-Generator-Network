Dozens of fish and reptiles have been killed by a toxic spill that will have Louisiana cleanup crews busy for months to come.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials confirmed that it was the result of an oil leak in the Caddo Parish from Mid-Valley Pipeline.

'I would call it a significant size spill,' said EPA on-scene coordinator Bill Rhotenberry.

Roughly 4,000 barrels of oil spilled into the Tete Bayou before operators noticed a drop in pressure.

Owner Sunoco Logistics shut down the line shortly after 8 a.m. Monday. 'That was a priority,' Shields told The Shreveport Times.

The pipeline is approximately 1,000 miles long from Longview, Texas to Ohio and Michigan.  

The lake will be monitored throughout the cleaning process.

About 250 workers are now on scene working on the recovery, wearing protective gear including respirators. 

Air monitors have also been placed throughout the area to make sure contaminants do not reach toxic levels. 

Workers clean up the 4,000 barrels of crude oil Saturday, Oct. 18, 2014, that spilled in Tete Bayou northwest of Shreveport, La

Some 1,900 barrels of oil have already been sucked up from the environment after crews worked furiously to clean up the spill

While evacuations were not necessary, three families left their homes voluntarily and will have expenses paid by Sunoco. 

'The only risk of VOCs is in the immediate area of oil,' Rhotenberry said. 'Out of the spill's pathway that's not much of an issue.'

As estimated 1,900 barrels of the oil have been recovered so far. 

Maintenance in the coming months will require regular placement of oil-absorbing material. 

Officials will also monitor surrounding wildlife for signs of contamination.

An investigation into the leak will be done by the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

Though initial recovery reports are promising, officials are asking hunters to keep clear of the area.

'It's a safety concern, also because of the equipment,' Louisiana State Police Troop G spokesman Matt Harris said.
