Stoke City midfielder Wilson Palacios has revealed how losing his younger brother to armed kidnappers has made him determined to tackle gang culture.

It was in 2007, while Palacios was playing for Birmingham City, that his younger brother Edwin, 14, was kidnapped from his family home in Honduras by an armed gang - before being found dead 19 months later.

'My brother was taken from us by one of these gangs, They wanted money so we paid the ransom but he never came back to us,' Palacios told the Daily Star.

'It was devastating. It changed my life and made me think I didn't want any other children to go through the same things.'

Since then, the former Tottenham midfielder has worked to prevent gang crime, including his latest project alongside coffee brand Kenco.

The 'Coffee vs Gangs' project aims to help 20 youngsters who are at risk of joining gangs by offering them opportunities to become coffee entrepreneurs through education and training.

Honduras has the highest murder rate in the world with an average of 20 killings a day, while drug trafficking, gang violence and poverty are also rife.

'After the kidnapping I wanted to quit football. But I realised that my brother would have wanted me to keep playing.

'He loved football. So as a family we decided that I should continue,' reveals Palacios.

The 30-year-old has named his son Edwin too preserve the memory of his brother.
