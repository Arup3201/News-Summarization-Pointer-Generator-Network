Brendan Rodgers has backed Steven Gerrard’s decision to retire from international football and believes it is 'great' for Liverpool.

The 34-year-old has experienced a difficult and emotional 48 hours after he made public the news that he would bring the curtain down on his 114 cap England career but he has received significant support from his club manager.

With Liverpool set to embark on their first Champions League campaign since 2009, Gerrard’s quality and experience will be crucial if they are to navigate the group stages and Rodgers will need the 34-year-old refreshed for the challenge.

Rodgers was an important figures when Gerrard sought advice about what to do in the aftermath of the World Cup and he has assured his influential midfielder that he has made the right decision at the right time.

‘First of all I spent lot of time talking with Steven on the matter,’ said Rodgers during a press conference at Fenway Park, ahead of Liverpool’s friendly with Roma, which will be staged in the early hours of Thursday morning.

‘I know how much it means to him to captain his country and there is no doubt he has been a wonderful captain. But you can’t forget that Liverpool means everything to him and missing out on international will make him fresher for the Champions League.

‘For us at Liverpool, it's great but it brings to an end what has been a great career for him.’

Rodgers has been one of the busiest managers in the transfer market this summer and is close to finalising an £8.5million deal for Loic Remy; the France international has started a medical here in Boston, the results of which should be known on Thursday.

Remy will give Liverpool more options up front but Rodgers refused to answer questions about any players who have yet to officially sign for Liverpool, preferring instead to concentrate on the deals he has got over the line and why nothing will change following Luis Suarez’s sale to Barcelona.

‘Our vision for the game really suited Luis’ qualities and I told him that when I took over,’ said Rodgers. ‘You could see that was the case over the last two years with the goals that he scored and the way that he played. That philosophy won’t change.

‘The personnel might change but the principles remain same: we want to be defensively strong, with good organisation; we want to retain possession for as long as we can and score goals. We can't replace Luis like for like but there are others we can bring in who can bring other facets.’

One player for whom Rodgers had particularly effusive praise was Emre Can, the £10million signing from Bayer Leverkusen. He returned to training at Harvard University after suffering with a tight calf and the Liverpool manager believes he will be an outstanding purchase.

‘I watched him quite a bit last season,’ said Rodgers. ‘The only position he didn't play was in goal or centre forward. That tells me everything. Sami Hyypia had great trust in him, to play him in important positions in big games. He is a real talent with pace, power and fits our profile perfectly.’
