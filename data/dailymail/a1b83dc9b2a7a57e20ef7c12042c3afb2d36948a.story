Oscar Pistorius' father has been accused of racism by South Africa's governing ANC after he appeared to blame high levels of violent crime against whites on the party.

Seeking to explain why his murder accused son kept at least one handgun - and had applied to own six more - Henke Pistorius said 'you can't rely on the police'.

'It speaks to the ANC government, look at white crime levels, why protection is so poor in this country, it's an aspect of our society', he told the Daily Telegraph.

Strong words: Oscar Pistorius's father Henke, right, has blamed South Africa's ANC government for failing to tackle crime against white people

Distance: The Olympic athlete's uncle Arnold: 'Oscar and the rest of the Pistorius family distances itself from the comments'

The comments, made on Sunday to the Telegraph's Southern Africa correspondent Aislinn Laing, have prompted official fury.

Jackson Mthembu, spokesman for the 
governing African National Congress, said it 'rejects with contempt' the
 claim that the government was not willing to protect white people.

'Not only is this statement devoid of 
truth, it is also racist', Mr Mthembu said. 'It is sad that he has 
chosen to politicise a tragic incident that is still fresh in the minds 
of those affected and the public.'

Oscar Pistorius, 26, has been charged 
with premeditated murder of his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, 29, 
after he shot her three times while she cowered in his bathroom.

The star athlete claims he killed her 
by accident and ever since he was granted bail, his team of PR 
representatives have worked hard to present him as a grieving victim of 
circumstance.

The case has already starting to 
divide opinion in South Africa. However, until Henke Pistorius' 
comments, race played no issue. Both Pistorius and Miss Steenkamp are 
white.

No doubt aware of the negative impact 
Henke Pistorius' comments may have, Oscar Pistorius' PR team yesterday 
rushed to distance the athlete from the growing row.

'Oscar Pistorius’ family is deeply concerned about the comments made by Oscar’s father', the family statement's read.

It went on: 'The comments doesn’t represent the views of Oscar or the rest of the Pistorius family'

'We are acutely aware of the fact that
 we are only at the beginning of a long road to prove that what happened
 to Reeva Steenkamp was a terrible accident and that Oscar  never 
intended to harm her, let alone cause her death.

Henke Pistorius, Oscar's 
grandfather Hendrik, and his paternal uncles Arnold, Theo and Leo have 
been reported to own a combined total of 55 shotguns and handguns.

Despite this, Henke Pistorius said, 
he, his fathers and brothers 'have been brought up in a way that we 
value the lives of others very highly.'

Contrary to Henke Pistorius' claim 
that whites are disproportionately impacted by South Africa's high 
levels of violent crime it is the country's black population that is 
bears the brunt of the problem, official statistics show.

Pistorius is charged with the 
premeditated killing of his girlfriend - he fired four shots 
through a locked toilet door at his home in South Africa, but said he 
believed he was shooting a burglar.

He is next due to appear at Pretoria Magistrates Court in June 
ahead of an eventual trial expected later this year.

Meanwhile American
 writer Michael Sokolove has told The Mail on Sunday how he spent time 
with the the Olympian in the run-up to the London 2012 Paralympics and
 was shocked at his obsession with weapons.

Pistorius
 bragged to him that on the previous night he had heard a noise, reached
 for the handgun under his bed and gone downstairs ready to confront an 
intruder before realising it was a false alarm.

He then showed Sokolove the gun in a wooden box ‘almost like a jewellery case’.

Sokolove said: ‘Oscar liked this 9mm semi-automatic very much. The gun was important to him. 

'He
 often felt vulnerable in his own home, and knowing that it was on the 
floor beside his bed, fully loaded, made him feel safer.

'I never suspected he would hurt someone else. He treated people with respect.’
