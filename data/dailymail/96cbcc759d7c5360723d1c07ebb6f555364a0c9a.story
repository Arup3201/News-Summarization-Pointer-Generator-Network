Kate Bostock joins Coast in September after leaving ASOS

One of Britain's most high-profile fashion bosses has announced she will be joining occasionwear brand Coast as CEO, following her departure from ASOS after just seven months.

Kate Bostock - who was ousted from M&S in October 2012 after a slump in sales and replaced by Belinda Earl, the woman behind the new Annie Liebovitz campaign - will start her new role as Chief Executive Officer in September.

The 56-year-old made a hasty exit from online giant ASOS last month saying it 'isn't the right place for me'.

In her new role Bostock - who previously held senior roles at Next and George - will work closely with Coast Chairman 
Derek Lovelock and the senior management team.

Her
resignation as ASOS' director of product was revealed by founder Nick 
Robinson, who explained that the average age of staff at the firm is 
between 27 and 28, prompting an ageism row.

Robertson said: 'Strategy wasn’t the issue. It was more about cultural 
fit and time of life.

'Our average age is 
27 or 28. People get to a stage in their career where they’re either up 
for a very big challenge or they're not.'

One headhunter who specialises in recruiting retail executives said she was appalled by Robertson's comment.

'It's an absolute ageist comment that 
was directed at Kate because she was a woman,' said Moira Benigson, 
managing partner of executive search group MBS.

'If the job had gone to a
man of the same calibre would people have said that?

'They are suggesting she is past her 
sell-by date, so when's the cut off? Is it when menopause starts? ASOS 
will have to behave like a mature business someday, but it is still 
young and entrepreneurial.'

Influential: Kate Bostock, previously head of merchandising at rival retailer Marks & Spencer, has quit a senior post at Asos

Brief stint: Nick Robertson, chief executive of Asos, said he was 'disappointed that things haven't worked out' as Ms Bostock's departure was announced

Kate Bostock's career trajectory has
seen her work her way up from a design role at a now defunct knitwear 
manufacturer in the East Midlands to become a key player at some of the 
biggest names in British retail.

Fresh
out of fashion college in Derby, Bostock secured a position at the now 
dissolved clothing manufacturer Klynton Davies, before moving on to Bent
& Son, party plan firm Pippa Dee and Charnwood Designs.

She
joined high street staple Next in 1995, where she would remain as 
director of kidswear until 2001 when she moved to Asda as product 
director for the supermarket giant's George clothing brand.

She
spent three years at Asda before being hired by Marks & Spencer in 
2004, where she rose to become executive director of general merchandise
on a package worth almost £1m.

Last
July Marks & Spencer reported dismal quarterly figures and 
announced that Ms Bostock would be leaving as head of clothing as part 
of a management shake-up. She stepped down from the board in October 
2012.

Online retailer 
Asos set about courting Ms Bostock and she took up a position as 
director of product and trading in January 2013 in what was widely 
hailed as a major coup for the firm.

The
56-year-old's latest post came with an undisclosed salary that 
reportedly represented a cut on what she was earning at rival retailer 
Marks & Spencer.

On 
Tuesday, after just seven months at Asos, it was announced that Ms 
Bostock had quit after agreeing with chief executive Nick Robertson the 
firm was 'not the right platform for her talent'.

Bostock said simply: 'Sadly I’ve 
concluded that Asos is not the right place for me.'

Announcing
Bostock's departure on Monday, multimillionaire retail tycoon Robertson said: 'Kate and I have agreed that ASOS is not the right 
platform for her talent.

'Of course we are disappointed that things 
haven't worked out and Kate leaves with our very best wishes.'

He was reported as saying: 'I'd love 
to say it was more sinister and complicated, but she gave it six months 
and decided it wasn't for her.'

Insiders said that while it was
Bostock's decision to leave, it was potentially driven by something of a
culture clash.

She joined ASOS after last year 
leaving Marks & Spencer, where she was considered the queen of 
fashion, having risen to run its clothing business.

Marks & Spencer is traditional in 
its approach to retailing and its products are aimed at a broader church
of shoppers whereas ASOS is aimed at 20-somethings, with an internet 
focus.

Previously she had worked at Next, which she joined in 1995, 
working her way up to director of childrenswear before moving to Asda in
2001, where she worked as product director for its George clothing 
brand.

Her experience meant she was regarded as one of the key voices in the fashion retail world.

She was brought in as Asos retail 
director on an undisclosed salary after Mr Robertson said he had wanted 
to appoint a 'big retail hitter to take the business on to the next 
level'.

One retail executive said: 'It was 
never going to be a marriage made in heaven - she's hardcore and he's 
king of flying by the seat of his pants.'

ASOS, which stands for As Seen On 
Screen, started life in 2000 marketing copies of clothes worn by famous 
people.

It now sells a wide range of clothing, from high street names to
high-end fashion.

It is also running a trial selling items for Primark, which has no other online presence.

Mr Robertson has grown ASOS into a £3.6bn business, in which he has a 9.4 per cent stake, currently worth £345million.

Asos, which stands for As Seen On Screen, started life in 2000 marketing copies of clothes worn by famous people

Back
in 2000, a website called As Seen On Screen launched to little fanfare.
Marketing copies of clothes worn by famous women to celebrity-obsessed 
girls, the site was manned by a staff of just three.

Thirteen
years and an abbreviated title later, Asos is now a global retail 
phenomenon that employs staff in Australia, the U.S., France and Germany
and attracts in excess of 20million internet shoppers every month.

The
website offers fashion-conscious 20 and 30-somethings instant access to
thousands of items from a vast array of major brands - along with its 
own creations following the launch of the Asos Own label for women in 
2004.

In 2010 came the launch of Asos 
Marketplace, a treasure trove of vintage fashion where users can browse 
the wares of small boutique brands or sell their own creations.

Having
well and truly shed its early reputation as a purveyor of rip-off 
versions of celebrity outfits, Asos is now a one-stop destination for 
everything from the high street to high end, with River Island or Zara 
dresses, vintage gems, and premium brands like Current Elliott or 
Equipment separated by just a few clicks of a mouse.

Having
this year opened new international offices in Lille and Munich, the 
retailer's spectacular growth shows no sign of slowing down. Asos 
reported a remarkable 45 per cent rise in sales to £194million in the 
three months to May 31, compared with the same period in 2012.

And
while its offering has expanded over the years to include designer 
diffusion lines and edgier, more expensive brands alongside its high 
street lines, the retailer's commitment to fast, affordable fashion was 
evident in its decision to feature items from Primark for a trial period
last month.

The decision 
to team up with the discount clothing store appears to have been 
welcomed by Asos' ever-expanding customer base, as chief executive Nick 
Robertson described the response to the Primark trial as 'phenomenal'.
