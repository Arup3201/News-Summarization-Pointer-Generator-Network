Since the WI launched their nude charity calendar 15 years ago, it seems every fireman, nurse and rowing club has got their wobbly bits out for Miss June or Mr December. 

So the pressure is on these days to make ever yearly planner bigger and better to stand out from the rest.

The 'Hotties' - a group of soldiers WAGS who consider themselves veterans of the naked charity calendar - have gone one better this year by launching their 2015 offering in one of the country's best-known strip clubs. 

The Hotties are a group of soldiers WAGS, they are launching their 2015 calendar at Stringfellows this weekend. Keira Goodwin, 32, (left) an antiques dealer from the Yorkshire Dales, is Miss June, while Eneshia Prescott, 30, (right) an events stylist from Lancaster, is Miss January

They have taken over Stringfellows in London's West End tomorrow evening and instead of the usual ladies wrapped around a pole, the 12 women involved in the calendar will be walking their famous curves down a catwalk.  

Keira Goodwin, 32, is Miss June and has been in the calendar for the last three years. 

She believes they are a success because they represent the everywoman 

Keira said: 'We're all very normal, we come in a range of sizes and all have different careers.

'In the last couple of years, we have raised more than £8,000 for Help For Heroes. 

'We sell them all over, places like Gibraltar, some in Camp Bastion, some in New Zealand.

'It's amazing when people send them to us and we can see how far they have traveled around the world - people get a lot of enjoyment from it.  

'What people like as well is that all of the Hotties interact with people on our social media pages, so it's not celeb-based where you aren't likely to get anything back.' 

All of the money from the event is going towards the Hotties' two nominated military charities - Soldiering On Awards and Mission Motorsport. 

Melanie Clarke, Eneshia Prescott, Emma Bond and Keira Goodwin have all modeled for the Hotties calendar for the last three years 

The Soldiering On Awards recognises inspirational and outstanding achievements of members of the armed forces. 

Medals are given to a range of achievements, like the Against All Odds Award, the Canine Partner Award, the Courage Award and the Family Values Award. 

Peter Stringfellow donated the club for the evening because the Armed Forces have been a cause close to his heart after marrying his wife Bella, whose own family has been personally affected by war. 

He said: 'It’s admirable to see what these wives and girlfriends of our serving military men have done to help raise awareness of the charities they support. 

'Hosting the 2015 calendar launch party to help bring attention to the Soldiering On Awards was the least we could do.'
