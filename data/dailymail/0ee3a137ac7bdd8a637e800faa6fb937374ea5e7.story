A senior NSW policeman has used his station's official Facebook page to question whether flags should have been lowered to half-mast for Phillip Hughes when slain servicemen were not given the same honour. 

The officer - believed to be Chief Inspector Bob Fitzgerald, who signs his posts 'Chief' - used the Blacktown local area command (LAC) Facebook page to express his private views about the reaction to  Hughes's death on Friday night.

'Should state flags only be lowered for sporting heroes who died through a sporting accident or for those that have died in the service of this great country?' he asked.

'Or perhaps someone could explain to the relatives of the men and women why they were no (sic) lowered to half mast for national heroes as opposed to sporting heroes. Chief.'

His comments, which were later removed, quickly sparked criticism from other users distressed by the death of Hughes on Thursday from catastrophic brain injuries caused by a cricket ball.

'Very inappropriate post,' wrote one. 'Pull ya head in Bob,' wrote another.

Dave Smith wrote: 'Totally out of line. Using your local area Facebook page to express your personal views. If these are your views then put them on your own page. Stick to reporting on the local police maters (sic) and story's (sic) not your own. Shame on you shame on you. This should be removed.'

Totally out of line: Facebook users criticise Blacktown's 'Chief' for questioning whether flags should have been lowered for Phillip Hughes when slain servicemen were not given the same honour.

Friday's post comes barely three months after Chief Inspector Fitzgerald was asked to take 'a more formal approach' to the Blacktown LAC Facebook page.

'Unfortunately my method of engaging with the community does not comply with the NSW Police Force Eyewatch guidelines,' Chief Inspector Fitzgerald said at the time.

Eyewatch is a Facebook-based version of Neighbourhood Watch intended to 'give community members the opportunity to participate in active crime prevention activities online,' according to the NSW Police Force.

Sense of humour: Chief Inspector Bob Fitzgerald has previously been warned about his posts on Blacktown LAC's Facebook page.

Blacktown local area commander Detective Superintendent Gary Merryweather did not name Chief Inspector Fitzgerald but said Friday's post was 'the personal opinion of a staff member' and had not been intended to offend.

'The post on the Blacktown Local Area Command's Eyewatch page was never intended to diminish the tragic death of Phillip Hughes,' Detective Superintendent Merryweather said.

'The thoughts of the NSW Police Force are with his family and friends at this sad time.

'The post on the Eyewatch page was the personal opinion of a staff member and not an endorsed comment by NSW Police.

'Blacktown Local Area Command recognises that this post may have caused distress to some followers and that post has now been deleted.'

Condolences: 'Chief' offers his condolences to the family of Phillip Hughes before using the Blacktown Local Area Command Facebook page to question whether flags should have been lowered in the cricketer's honour.

A NSW police spokeswoman said an investigation into the matter was ongoing and no action had been taken against any officer at this stage. 

On Saturday, the Blacktown LAC Facebook page featured a picture of a cricket bat and cap outside the station. Jan Horne responded: 'Id put my Sons old one out but someone would steal it around my area!'

Vickie Micallef wrote: 'yes the same as me - we would have put my son's bat out too but afraid it will get stolen'.

The first post from 'Chief' began: 'A question? It's a very sad thing that an Australian sportsperson has died. The following commentary means no disrespect at all. As a cricketing family I understand his love for the sport.

'But can anyone tell me the name of the Australian service personnel that have died or the hundreds of servicemen and women that have been seriously injured for this country of ours not through sporting accident but through war?'

Stephen McRae responded: 'With all due respect. I find this post disrespectful. Our service men and woman are on a totally different level'...

'Yesterday we lost an Aussie of whom we have all got to know and respect and sort of understand. 

'We all grieve for this young man as he lost his life doing what he loves with the goal of representing our great country.

'A respectful young bloke who was taken playing a game of cricket.' 

Phillip Hughes died on Thursday of catastrophic brain injuries suffered when he was hit by a bouncer at the SCG on Tuesday.

Chief Inspector Fitzgerald has previously received publicity for his light-hearted posts on the Blacktown LAC Facebook page. In August he announced online he was quitting the site.

'To the good people of Blacktown and the West,' that post began.

'It’s been a real blast engaging with you through this medium with a little humour.

'Unfortunately my method of engaging with the community does not comply with the NSW Police Force Eyewatch guidelines.

'Please continue to support our honest hardworking police and all emergency services. So take care out there, be proud of where you live and be safe.'

Chief Inspector Fitzgerald had been asked to take 'a more formal approach' in operating the page, according to the Blacktown Advocate.

Fans of the 'Chief' soon took to Facebook offering their support for the area's popular mental health and Aboriginal issues officer. Five days after quitting administration of the page, Chief Inspector Fitzgerald was back. 

“I am astonished - I’ve been getting emails and hundreds of comments,” Chief Inspector Fitzgerald told the Blacktown Advocate.

He wanted the Blacktown LAC Facebook page to encourage community co-operation with their local police.

“I want to make it friendly and open to the point where people can feel comfortable with police - we’re not robots,” he said.
