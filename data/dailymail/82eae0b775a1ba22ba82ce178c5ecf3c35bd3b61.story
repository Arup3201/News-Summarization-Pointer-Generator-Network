She is a 71-year-old Dame, a businesswoman with a fortune of millions and mother to two sons.

But just as nothing stopped Vivienne Westwood from living her life the way she chose back in the punk era when she was setting out as a fashion designer, nothing will stop her now.

And as two large-than-life nude portraits of the flame-haired designer were revealed to a well-heeled crowd at the ICA last night, it was clear that she may have been picking up her pension for 11 years now, Vivienne Westwood is anything but retiring.

Dame Vivienne was very much the star of the show - in more ways than one - as she attended the launch of close friend Juergen Teller's first major UK exhibition in 10 years, held at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London yesterday.

Striking: The portraits of Dame Vivienne, taken three years ago, went on show in the UK for the first time today at London's Institute of Contemporary Art

Not only was her presence at the party very much felt when she arrived in her typical flamboyant style on the arm of her rugged, bearded husband Andreas, but the exhibition itself was dominated by two larger than life nudes of Dame Westwood in various states of repose.

One colourful shot sees Dame Vivienne sitting naked on a couch, smiling cheerfully for the camera as if she cared not a jot that the world would one day see the image.

And given Dame Vivienne's notorious approach to establishment and conformity, you can be sure she really couldn't give a fig (leaf).

Teller's first exhibition in the UK in over ten years also included nude portraits of models Lily Cole (pictured here) and Kristen McMenamy

Impressive: 'I've worked with her a long time and I'm always amazed at how wonderful her skin is,' Teller said of the work

The portrait was taken three years ago when Vivienne was 68 years old.

Speaking
 to New York magazine when it was first revealed in an exhibition at the
 Lehmann Maupin gallery in the city, Teller said photographing Vivienne 
was an amazing experience - and he was blown away, as ever, by her 
beauty.

'It was 
lovely,' said Teller at the time, 'in her house, on a Sunday evening. 
I’ve worked with her a long time, and I’m always amazed at how wonderful
 her skin is.

'She 
looks amazing and she’s, like, 70 now [Vivienne has since turned 71]. 
She was 68 when I did the pictures (...) and I was just curious about 
how she would look naked.

'If you think of naked pictures of old people, they’re all wrinkled – and they are not! So I like it a lot.

'And
 then when she said, ‘Okay, let’s do it,’ and she was sitting there I 
was thinking, ‘Oh my f****** hell, man!’ I didn’t quite expect it. So 
that was great!'

Elsewhere in the exhibition, his 
first in the UK in over 10 years, Teller showed nude portraits of models
 Lily Cole and Kristen McMenamy.

The exhibition, which opens today at the The Institute of Contemporary Art, is a visual narrative of the man who has become one of the most important photographers 
of his generation.

The iconic images take in Teller's landmark
 fashion, art, personal and commercial photography from the Nineties 
through to the current day, as well as some landscapes and family 
portraits from his family collection.

The man of the moment: Juergen Teller at the ICA last night, where along with his portraits were ads he has shot for various big fashion brands

Special guests: Nancy Dell'Olio and model Laura Bailey at last night's unveiling

The 49-year-old German-born 
photographer, who has also photographed famous names from  Victoria 
Beckham to Helena Bonham Carter and One Direction, entered the London 
photography scene by taking pictures for use on record covers.

It was his iconic photograph of Sinéad O’Connor for her single Nothing 
Compares 2 You that brought him into the commercial big time - and his career has 
gone from strength to strength ever since.

Teller’s photographs first appeared 
in fashion magazines in the late 80s, and included portraits of Kate 
Moss when she was just fifteen years old.

He
 has gone on to shoot some of Vogue, i-D and W magazines most iconic 
covers featuring the likes of Vivienne Westwood as well as most of Marc 
Jacobs' campaigns since- he even captured Victoria Beckham poking her 
head out of a Marc Jacobs shopping bag.

A selection of Teller's books and tear sheets from his editorial and advertising work will also be on show.
