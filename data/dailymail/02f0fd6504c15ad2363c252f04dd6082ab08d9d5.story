A California man is facing multiple charges in relation to the death of a transgender woman who allegedly died from an unregulated silicone injection he gave her at a party.

Liborio De La Luz Ramos, 44, was arrested Thursday and charged with one felony count of voluntary manslaughter by an unlawful act and two felony counts of unauthorized practice of medicine, the Los Angeles Times reports.

Ramos is neither licensed to practice medicine nor is he allowed to perform  surgical procedures. 

Charges: Liborio De La Luz Ramos, 44 (photographed), is facing multiple charges in relation to the death of a transgender woman who allegedly died from an unregulated silicone injection he gave her at a party  

But police say he did just that, giving Felipe 'Katya' De La Riva, 40, the silicone injections to her buttocks that allegedly led to her death. 

Ramos and Riva met through Santa Ana's transgender community, ABC reports, and Riva reportedly received the injection from Ramos to enhance her buttocks in late December at a 'silicone party' in a Santa Ana hotel.

On Jan. 1, Riva admitted herself into Kaiser Hospital because of a respiratory problem, according to a police report. She died nearly three weeks later of 'silicone embolism syndrome,' caused by the injection.

Hospital officials contacted the coroner's office after they became suspicious of Riva's death, saying that the injection was received in a non-medical facility, the report states.

Complete: Antonio Viramontes of the LGBT Center in Santa Ana said that deaths similar to Riva's are happening across the country as women who believe they were born in the wrong body will do anything to feel complete

Ramos is alleged to have injected a 28-year-old with silicone at his Santa Ana home, CBS reports. Detectives say they believe there may be more victims and are urging any others to contact the Santa Ana Police Department.

The investigation is ongoing and Ramos is being held at Santa Ana jail on $500,000 bail. 

Antonio Viramontes of the LGBT Center in Santa Ana told CBS that deaths similar to Riva's are happening across the country as women who believe they were born in the wrong body will do anything to feel complete.

Super Glue: Viramontes said that the unregulated injections, typically very painful, are deep perforations usually sealed with super glue

Active in the Community: Friends of Riva's say that she was very active in Santa Ana's LGBT community 

He said that the unregulated injections, typically very painful, are deep perforations usually sealed with super glue.

Police say Riva paid Ramos $400-$1,000 for the injections and used a cattle syringe to administer the silicone, CBS reports.  

'It is usually with some kind of chemicals that have not been approved,' Viramontes said. 

'Some of the stuff that I have heard that gets used, and is very common, is industrial-grade silicone, airplane fuel, goat's milk, dog urine.'
