Stuart Broad became the eighth Englishman to take 250 Test wickets when he dismissed India captain MS Dhoni on the first day at Lord's.

The tall fast bowler reached the landmark when Dhoni edged a full length ball to Matt Prior behind the stumps.

And that meant Broad joined the likes of Sir Ian Botham, Fred Trueman, Graeme Swann and his team-mate James Anderson in taking 250 or more Test wickets for England.

Join the club: Stuart Broad (second right) celebrates becoming the eighth Englishman to take 250 Test wickets

Stuart Broad became the eighth English bowler to take 250 or more Test wickets:

Sir Ian Botham  383 wickets

James Anderson 362 wickets

Bob Willis 325 wickets

Fred Trueman 307 wickets

Derek Underwood  297 wickets

Graeme Swann 255 wickets

Brian Statham 252 wickets

Stuart Broad 251 wickets         

And Broad is the second youngest to reach the milestone at 28 years and 23 days - only Botham (26 and 355 days) was younger.

And he joined another illustrious club, becoming the 13th player to score 2,000 Test runs and take 250 Test wickets. The only other other Englishman on that list is, predictably, Botham.

Anderson also broke two records on day one at Lord's.

When he had Shikhar Dhawan caught in the slips early on, he became the leading wicket taker in Test matches in England.

And with the dismissal of Virat Kohli, he surpassed Sir Ian Botham to become the bowler to have taken most Test wickets at Lord's.

Appealing habit: Broad implores the umpire to give Ravi Jadeja out - without success
