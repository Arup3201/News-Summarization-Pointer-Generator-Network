Everton winger Kevin Mirallas has done his own soul-searching following the unedifying sight of West Ham's James Tomkins clutching his face in fake agony despite being shoved several inches lower, in the chest, by the Belgian international.

Tomkins has been rightly castigated for falsely trying to get a fellow professional in trouble during last weekend's hostile encounter at Goodison Park, but as a father to two-year-old son Juan, Mirallas also accepts responsibility for his role in the incident.

Accepting that footballers have a duty to their audience of varying ages, he doesn't think he was right to push Tomkins in the first place after a set-to sparked by his foul on West Ham's Morgan Amalfitano.

'The sad thing for me, reflecting on it, was that it was also a bit stupid of myself to react in the way I did. I always try to give a good positive image,' said Mirallas.

'A yellow card could have been a red card offence so I think I was lucky with my own reaction. It was rash. In a match, things sometimes happen that are a source of regret afterwards.'

He's not letting Tomkins off the hook for his embarrassing play-acting though. 'It was sad to see simulation of that level, upsetting,' said Mirallas.

'You go out to be the best role model on the pitch, not just for the fans but the millions of children who watch football too.'

Fortunately for Mirallas, referee Mark Clattenburg wasn't conned by Tomkins and he is therefore available to face Spurs on Sund.

It's a game that is important to Everton's ambition of qualifying for the Champions League by topping last season's fifth-place finish and Mirallas goes to White Hart Lane having made an impressive comeback last weekend from a hamstring injury that kept him out for almost two months.

His man-of-the-match performance in Thursday night's 2-0 Europa League win against Wolfsburg saw the 27-year-old set up the first goal for compatriot Romelu Lukaku, and score the second.

'It's true I am back quicker than the original diagnosis claimed. Thankfully it didn't turn out to be as serious as they first believed,' said Mirallas. 'I had some very good care in Belgium and I have come back strong.

'I don't see why our team shouldn't reach fourth or do even better.

'Everton weren't able to penetrate to the highest levels before, maybe we didn't have the resources or players to do it.

'But now we are in a position to sign more expensive players, there is a certain stability in the club, players are staying more than in the past and we are able to target higher-quality players that come up for sale.

'I am not saying it is necessary to go out and splurge and make big purchases, but buying one or two quality players each year results in having the best team possible, and I think that is what we are doing.

'This year has been excellent, playing in European competition as well, and I think we are on the right route.'

While results have picked up after an indifferent start to the season, Everton's crowded fixture list has led to injuries with John Stones, Bryan Oviedo and Antolin Alcaraz ruled out of the trip to north London and doubts also surrounding Leighton Baines, Steven Naismith, James McCarthy, Gareth Barry and Steven Pienaar.

It may lead Martinez to ask Mirallas to play his third game in a week where he will come up against two fellow Belgian internationals Jan Vertonghen and Nacer Chadli, the latter a childhood friend from back home.

Mirallas has already opened contract talks with the club with his current deal having less than two years to run.

'Everyone is out to get the best they can in terms of their contract in terms of their contract but I will just underline that I am very happy here,' he said.
