Rory

Rory McIlroy has no chance of winning The Open if he continues to risk using his driver on links golf courses, insists former champion Tony Jacklin.

Tiger Woods had the perfect strategy for attacking Hoylake when he won here eight years ago, avoiding fairway bunkers by using his low-flying ‘stinger’ iron off nearly every tee.

But this year’s softer conditions mean more players will consider attacking the course from the tee.

High risk: Rory McIlroy takes out his driver during a practice round on Wednesday

McIlroy has a two-iron in his bag this week but has admitted he will be using his driver just as often. Jacklin, who is the last Englishman to win the Claret Jug in England when he won at Royal Lytham in 1969, says that could be a disastrous tactic for the Northern Irishman.

‘Tiger Woods will have the strategy absolutely nailed down. He will be playing an iron a lot more than Rory,’ said Jacklin on Wednesday. ‘But Rory, despite being brought up on links golf, is historically not that good a links player. It’s about figuring out that the game is still played on the ground here.’

Jacklin explained that he thought hitting drivers could only lead to problems at Hoylake and cited three links legends  – Tom Watson, Peter Thomson and Bobby Locke, who have 14 Open titles between them – as the men McIlroy must emulate if he wants to improve on a record of just one top-10 at the Open.

‘If you hit a driver up into the elements it gives the wind longer to affect the ball, and when it lands it doesn’t run as far so you’re gaining minimal distance anyway. It’s not about distance. All the great Open champions all figured it out: keep the ball under control, avoid the hazards. The key to links golf is strategy and patience.’

Hoylake is famed for the strong winds which blow in off the Wirral Estuary and provide the course’s main defence. But the weather forecast for this week looks good with just light winds. Jacklin, who is at Hoylake as an ambassador for Glenmorangie, is hoping for a sterner test, however.

‘If players are taking drivers and the wind blows they’re not going to be able to get round,’ he said. ‘These courses can be horrendous when the wind blows.

‘I remember one of the last Opens I played in, at Lytham, Jeff Maggert was hitting driver off every tee.  I felt like saying: “What are you doing? What are you trying to achieve?”

‘I know links golf better than I know anything. I’ve been playing it for 50 years in all conditions. I hope the wind blows. It’s the supreme test.’
