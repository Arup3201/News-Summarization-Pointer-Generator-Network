An unidentified man was caught on tape creeping around the front of a California home wearing stolen women's underwear.

The man was clad in a bra on his chest as well as one across his face and a skirt.

Each item was stolen from a pick-up parked outside the house.

This unidentified man was caught creeping outside a California home wearing stolen women's underwear

The man was so bizarre he even scared off the family cat while he stumbled around outside the Californian home

Authorities told WPTV that the man was captured by security cameras in the early hours of Wednesday morning outside the Coachella property.

He was even seen hovering outside the front door, where he scared away the family's cat.

The family said they've been robbed before but that this case was bizarre.

'We have had incidents happen where stuff has been stolen, but never like this where some guy is completely naked. At a point in the video, you actually see him sniffing the bra,' said the victim's daughter, Vidal Corone.

The thief ran off into the desert after narrowly avoiding law enforcement still wearing the assortment of women's underwear

A Riverside County sheriff's deputy can be seen to drive passed the home while the thief is in the truck, but the cop continued on his way without spotting the cross-dressing burglar.

Once the law is gone, the thief runs for the desert.

'We all have kids here and for this guy to be walking around naked in a bra and a skirt you know stealing, it's not right, what if he's a psychopath and he goes around into somebody's house and does something worse,' Corone said.
