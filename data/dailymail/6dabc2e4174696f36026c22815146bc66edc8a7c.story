David McIntosh is not the most popular man at the moment over allegations he was in contact with his ex while engaged to Kelly Brook.

But Geordie Shore star Ricci Guarnaccio has leapt to David's defence amid cheating claims and exclusively told MailOnline his friend is in 'a world of pain' since being dumped by Kelly on Friday.

Ricci, 28, became best friends with David when they starred together in Celebrity Big Brother and he stands by the bodybuilder saying he was a dutiful partner while he was with Kelly and has 'done nothing wrong.'

'He's [David] is one of the nicest and most genuine lads I've met,' Ricci told MailOnline.

'But seeing the way his relationship was with Kelly it was hard to standby as a friend and watch him say sorry for a lot of things when he'd done nothing wrong'.

Ricci celebrated his birthday with David last week with a celeb filled night out in London.

However, Vicky Pattinson's ex said the heavily tattooed Gladiator star only stayed at the party attended by White Dee and Ola and James Jordan, for an hour, because he felt 'so uncomfortable' in the nightclub without Kelly by his side.

'We went out for my birthday and he didn't take pictures with anybody and stayed away from everyone in the private area of the club and made us leave after just an hour because he felt so uncomfortable in that environment,' Ricci explained to MailOnline.

Hitting back at Kelly for calling off her engagement to David over claims he was still in touch with his ex girlfriend Sarah Harper, Ricci said: 'I didn't like seeing my friend in a world of pain and not being able to enjoy just one night out with the lads which was very sad.

'We even had to cancel our appearance at the NRTA's the next night.'

'David loves Kelly so much,' Ricci added. 'And since I've known him was always conscious of making decisions to please her.'

On Saturday it emerged David was said to still be in touch with mother-of-two Sarah Harper, who he reportedly shares a dog with, and even visited her at her Manchester home while Kelly was abroad working.

According to the Sunday Mirror, David, 28, claims he made Kelly, 34, aware of the trip to visit Sarah who allegedly dated for over year before meeting Kelly in January.

Brook was reportedly also made aware that he was texting and emailing his ex, leading to her decision to end their nine-month relationship on Friday.

But the Sun on Sunday claim that Kelly fired off an abundance of texts to Sarah in a bid to shut down contact between the 33-year-old glamour model and David.

According to the Gladiator star’s ex-girlfriend, the feud allegedly began when David asked Sarah to send him a photo of their pet dog they had purchased during their romance.

Once Kelly realised the two were still in touch, Sarah says she started to receive the spiteful texts from Kelly such as: ‘Your [sic] like a bad lingering smell. Just a stench. That needs to go.’

And: ‘I don’t care if I look mental. But I have your address. And if you ever try it with him. I will come to you. Ok.’

David and Sarah started their relationship in 2013 after meeting on Facebook but Sarah said he quickly kicked her to the curb after meeting Kelly on New Year’s Eve last year.

Despite 
David’s whirlwind romance with Kelly and their shock engagement in 
March, just weeks after they began dating, Sarah claims David stayed 
over at her house in May.

David
 himself broke his silence on Sunday. 'There are two sides to every 
story. You are free to believe what you wish...it doesn't alter the 
facts,' he wrote on his Twitter page.

Kelly Brook had no comment when contacted by MailOnline while David responded to Sarah's allegations in an open letter.
