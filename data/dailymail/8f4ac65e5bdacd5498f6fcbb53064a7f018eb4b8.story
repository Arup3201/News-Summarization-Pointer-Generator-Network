The drug addict parents of a toddler who was punched, kicked or stamped causing massive internal injuries that led to his death have been jailed.

Levi-Blu Cassin was found unconscious at his home in Chelmsey Wood in Birmingham in February last year.

His mother Danielle Cassin, 27, and father Mark Piper, 31, were today both given nine-year-prison terms for allowing his death.

The pair had both blamed each other for the youngster's injuries. 

The parents of Levi-Blu Cassin, Danielle Cassin (left) and Mark Piper (right) have been jailed for nine years each for causing or allowing the 22-month-old's death after he died following massive internal injuries 

Both were cleared of murder and manslaughter following a trial at Birmingham Crown Court, but were found guilty of causing or allowing his death and jailed for nine years each.

After the case his grandmother branded the sentence 'disgusting' for a child's life.  

Mr Justice Goss said it was most likely that Levi Blu suffered his injuries as he lay against a hard surface and his organs were 'compressed'. This would have been caused by punches, kicks, or stamps  with 'very significant force required.'

He branded the couple 'selfish, neglectful and manipulative'.

The trial previously heard that his small intestine had been split in two. 

During the trial the court heard that Cassin had been in touch with social workers before the birth of her son and a child protection agreement was put in place to keep Levi-Blu safe. This meant Piper, of no fixed address, was banned from staying at the flat they shared in Chelmsey Wood.

However the pair flouted the rules, with Piper hiding behind a mattress when social workers carried out inspections.

A serious case review will be carried out by Solihull Local Safeguarding Children Board to discover if there were failings leading to Levi-Blu's death.

The court also heard that Cassin, of  Chelmsley Wood, smoked Class A drugs in her son's presence and would take him to crack dens for hours at a time.

Mr Justice Goss said she had put drugs above her son and concealed violence in her relationship and 'chose to permit Levi to be exposed to all the attendant risks.'

Piper, of no fixed address, faced allegations he beat two of his other sons and regularly battered Cassin at the flat they shared in Smiths Wood, Solihull.

Timothy Raggatt QC, prosecuting, read a victim impact statement from Levi's grandmother Angela Cassin. 

She said the child was 'utterly defenceless' in the hands of those she thought would care for him.

Mr Raggatt added: 'There is a great and continuing sense of loss for the little boy.'

Cassin, who wept in the dock, had no previous convictions. 

Piper had convictions related to drugs and robbery in 2001. He had also previously been convicted for possessing cocaine and cannabis as well as a bladed article.

Mark Piper, 31, was accused during the trial in Birmingham of battering two of his other sons and Cassin 

In 1999 he was convicted of possessing a bladed article.

Christopher Millington QC, defending Cassin, said she had written a letter to the judge speaking of a 'lifetime of regret.' Piper was also said to have written a letter. 

The judge said Piper would rather play on his Playstation than care for his son.

Speaking outside court Levi's grandmother, Angela Cassin, told the BBC: 'Nine years for a baby's life - that's absolutely disgusting.

'It's not justice - we don't even know what happened to him.'
