Back in 2001, GHD launched its first straighteners - and transformed the hair of an entire nation.

Twelve years on, and GHD is launching a new straightener which promises even faster styling for the most unruly hair. But it’s up against some pretty stiff competition.

From straighteners infused with keratin and argan oil to steam shots and irons with built-in combs and heat protection, it’s no longer just about two heated ceramic plates.

With the help of Mark Smith, senior stylist at John Frieda, we put some of the latest designs to the test . . .

Banishing curls: Claire tries the Mark Hill straighteners

Simple but effective: Cloud Nine Micro Iron

Cloud Nine Micro Iron, £54.95, cloudninehair.com

They say: At ‘only six inches in length’ this iron is undoubtedly micro and billed as ‘perfect for styling on the go’.

Temperature: 150c.

Mark’s view: A simple-to-use and good-quality mini iron. You wouldn’t want to use them on a lot of hair, but they’d be great around the hairline, and because they have a relatively low fixed temperature it means you’re less likely to fry the hair in this area, which tends to need lower temperatures as it’s finer.

Verdict: 4/5

Best for: Short hair, or someone who can justify having a second pair specifically for the hairline, or touch-ups.

Get what you pay for: GHD Eclipse

GHD Eclipse, £195, ghdhair.com

They say: ‘Breakthrough patented tri-zone technology’ means there are six sensors in the plates which maintain a constant temperature, so even the unruliest hair only needs a single stroke.

Temperature: 185c.

Mark’s view: GHD established the market for straighteners in the UK and this new pair upholds its reputation. I like the idea of a fixed temperature, as too often people straighten at 230c, which is just too high.

These have no gimmicks, they feel good, glide well and have rounded edges so you can use them to curl, too. The Rolls-Royce of irons,  but I’m not convinced they need to be so pricey - and this loses them a point.

Verdict: 4/5

Best for: Those who want the best and are prepared to pay for it.

Best for thick hair: L'Oreal Steampod

L'Oreal Steampod, £150, lorealprofessionel.co.uk

They say: The accompanying water reservoir helps ‘deliver a continuous flow of high-pressure steam’.

Temperature: Five settings, ranging from 170c to 210c.

Mark’s view: In the salon, we never use steam to straighten hair and we’d  never advise using irons on wet hair, as it’s more prone to damage when wet.

These certainly left hair wet after the first stroke. I don’t think for most people the result justifies the hassle and the high price.

Verdict: 2/5

Best for: Thick, coarse hair that’s difficult to blow-dry.

Don't bother: Nicky Clarke Salon Pro Straightener with Comb

Nicky Clarke Salon Pro Straightener with Comb, £49.99, nickyclarke.com

They say: A built-in comb that gives hair ‘a smooth and shiny look and keeps a natural-looking amount of volume’, plus a tourmaline plate that helps lock moisture in.

Temperature: Six settings up to 230c.

Mark’s view: There is some evidence tourmaline can produce ions that help give a smoother finish to hair, but that didn’t help these. The plates didn’t  feel smooth, the controls  were easy to knock and the comb is pointless.

Square plates mean you can’t use them to curl. Rubber at the ends to stop you burning your fingers was a nice touch.

Verdict: 1/5

Best for: Sorry, don’t bother, they’re cheap and they feel it.

Didn't impress: Toni & Guy Infusion Straightener

Toni & Guy Infusion Straightener, £79.99, boots.com

They say: A ‘unique conditioning treatment reservoir’ in the straighteners is designed to be filled with a heat protection mist. This means, according to the manufacturer, ‘you can skip a step and don’t have to worry about heat damage.’

Temperature: Five settings from 160c to 230c.

Mark’s view: The reservoir was really fiddly and made the straighteners very heavy. They didn’t glide through hair like they should and didn’t impress overall.

Verdict: 1/5

Best for: Save your money and buy the Vidal Sassoon ones at the same price instead (right).

Reduces damage to hair: Remington Keratin Therapy Pro Straightener

Remington Keratin Therapy Pro Straightener, £89.99, argos.co.uk

They say: ‘Keratin Micro Conditioners are infused in the Advanced Keratin Ceramic coated plates’ and with a ‘heat protection sensor’ that lowers the temperature if your hair is wet to prevent damage. These reduce breakage by up to 57 per cent compared with standard straighteners.

Temperature: Five settings from 160c to 230c

Mark’s view: These went through the hair nicely and I like the idea that they adjust the heat if they think it’s damaging your hair.

The company says the keratin - a protein that’s an essential part of strong hair - comes to the surface of the plates when you heat them. They guarantee the keratin will last at least five years. If it’s true that’s quite impressive.

Verdict: 3/5

Best for: Anyone who wants to minimise damage to their hair.

Style over substance: Mark Hill Sleek & Chic Iconic Super Styler

Mark Hill Sleek & Chic  Iconic Super Styler, £99.99, boots.com

They say: Ceramic plates are infused with Moroccan argan oil, which helps them ‘glide through each section to smooth, remove frizz, condition and add amazing shine’.

Temperature: Eleven settings from 120c to 220c.

Marks’ view: Once you get over the garish animal print styling - they come in different colours, too - they slide through the hair really nicely.

The argan oil is a bit gimmicky because while it does make the plates smoother so they glide through the hair more quickly, you’re not left with any oil on your hair so it’s a bit misleading. It’s not bad, but it seems like more of a fashion item.

Verdict: 3/5

Best for: Trend-obsessed teens.

Not bad: Vidal Sassoon Detox Salon Series Titanium Styler

Vidal Sassoon Detox Salon Series Titanium Styler, £79.99, boots.com

They say: Heated plates are coated in 100 per cent titanium ‘which helps to reduce the build up of bacteria and provide hair with maximum moisture protection’.

Temperature: Five settings from 150c  to 230c

Mark’s view: These feel more expensive than they are, they’re not too heavy and the temperature gauge is in a sensible place. I’d argue ‘build up of bacteria’ isn’t a real problem for straighteners, but they went through the hair well and didn’t catch too badly when I used them to curl.

Verdict: 4/5

Best for: An everyday straightener and a more pocket-friendly price than GHDs.
