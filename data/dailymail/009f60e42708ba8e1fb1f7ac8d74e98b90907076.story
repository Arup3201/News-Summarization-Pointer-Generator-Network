Hannah, 26, also shared the photo on her Instagram account, writing: 'We did it! What an awesome way to celebrate international women's day/weekend! So much positivity in the air! Ladies I salute you!' 

In addition to promoting natural beauty, the snapshot was also a celebration of the brand's launch of its latest Aerie Swim and AerieReal campaigns.

The party held at the Mondrian hotel in South Beach was filled with Aerie fans of all shapes and sizes modeling the company's latest collection.

'We couldn't be more proud to further our Aerie Real campaign and bring our 'Love Your Real Selfie' message to life with this memorable and exciting aerial platform,' Aerie Brand President Jennifer Foyle said in a statement. 

She continued: 'Aerie is seizing spring break as an opportunity to challenge beauty standards, share a brilliant swim collection designed for all Aerie girls and celebrate body-positivity with the world's largest selfie.'

The Photoshop-free group shot is a part of the brand's Aerie Real campaign, which they launched last year with models who were left completely natural - without any airbrushing. 

'The Aerie Real movement is an important benchmark in the evolution of the Aerie brand, which has always celebrated its customers' unique spirit and optimism,' Ms Foyle explained.

'By challenging traditional supermodel standards, Aerie sparks a conversation with consumers about the true meaning of real and unretouched beauty.'
