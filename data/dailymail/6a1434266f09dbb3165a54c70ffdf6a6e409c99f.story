A small Tennessee town has been rocked by child rape charges against the high school's star quarterback who allegedly had sex with a 12-year-old girl who fell pregnant.

Princeton Harlan, 18, who has garnered interest from six colleges across the southeast to play football, was charged with two other team-mates for child rape in Mount Pleasant, Tennessee on Wednesday.

Harlan, who was released on $100,000 bail, stands accused of having sex with a 12-year-old girl who fell pregnant in July and terminated the pregnancy, authorities said.

Yet while the alleged sex was consensual, the trio has been charged with child rape as the state rules anyone under the age of 13 cannot consent to sex. If convicted, 
they face 25 years in prison.

Arrest: Princeton Harlan, a star quarterback at his Tennessee high school, has been charged with child rape after he allegedly had sex with a 12-year-old girl who fell pregnant

The rural town, home to 4,561 residents, has been left shocked by the charges.

'Itâ€™s really devastating,' Wendall Holder, a 1989 Mt. Pleasant graduate who has lived in the small town her whole life, told The Tennessean.

'Princeton is being looked at by major colleges and itâ€™s just a big deal here. He had a lot ahead of him, and he had set some passing records here at Mt. Pleasant.'

Tennessee, Vanderbilt, Auburn, 
Kentucky, Mississippi State and Cincinnati have shown interest in the 
6-foot-4, 188-pound senior quarterback, the paper reported.

Holder, who knows Harlan and the 
family of the 12-year-old, added: 'It's traumatic for what's happened for
 her. For both parties involved it's pretty hard.'

Accused: Police began investigating Harlan and two of his teammates after the girl told her mother she was pregnant. They allegedly had consensual sex with her on separate occasions

Another local, Wayne McWright, called the news 'alarming'.

'It's a tragedy more so for the young girl,' he said. 'Then also my heart goes out to the young fellow, too, because somehow he got off track. Young people sometimes do foolish things.'

Ed Brennan, who owns a building on Main Street that houses the Helping Hands Mission in Mt. Pleasant, said the charges had shaken the small town.

'If you hear about (something like this) in Nashville, it's kind of, "Well, that kind of stuff goes on up there",' he said. 'If you hear it down here, these are supposed to be good Christian people.

'We're a tight-knit little family. 
Everybody knows each other. We're missing the kids in church and maybe 
this will drive them back into the church where they belong. I hope it 
does.'

Harlan was released from jail on Wednesday after posting $100,00 bail. He will be arraigned November 5.

Authorities began investigating Harlan and two other suspects, a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old, last month after the girl told her mother she thought she was pregnant, WKRN reported.

She was four-and-a-half weeks pregnant when the pregnancy was terminated, authorities said. They have not given any indication on who fathered the child.

The teenagers allegedly had sex with the girl on separate occasions in July but police would not reveal how they met the child.

Harlan was arrested without incident outside the high school. The other teenagers have not been named because of their ages but have been released to their parents.
