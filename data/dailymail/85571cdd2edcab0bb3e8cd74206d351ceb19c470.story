Furniture giant IKEA has banned people from playing one of the most-loved childhood games - hide and seek.

More than 33,000 shoppers have signed up on Facebook to participate in the giant maze-like store in Tempe, inner west of Sydney on Saturday, May 23.

The event will begin from 1pm and within 10 minutes from the starting time, players are encouraged to hide in wardrobes, storage units and underneath piles of soft toys.

But the Swedish retailer has put a stop to the unofficial event after attracting tens of thousands of participants, claiming the game 'raises security issues for both customers and co-workers.'

'As many of you may have heard, there are a couple of large hide-and-seek games being planned for IKEA stores in Australia,' IKEA said in a statement. 

'While the prospect of seeing many of you trying to camouflage yourselves among the meatballs has its appeal, we are unfortunately unable to host or support these games.

'Due to the level of interest these games attract we would not be able to guarantee everyone’s safety and the threat this poses to our co-workers, customers and game participants is just too great. We would still love to have you visit – no need to hide!'

However, the organisers of the event have set out  rules ahead of the game, with each player expected to pay an entry fee of one dollar.

The last person left unfound will walk away with the prize pool money but in an event, if all players are discovered, the money will be donated to a charitable cause, the organisers claim.

Other rules include restrictions to hiding such as 'do not hide in fire escapes' and 'do not hide in toilets.' 

The ban comes after Amsterdam IKEA in Eindhoven were forced to cancel the bizarrely popular event

Hundreds have expressed their interests, with many saying they will travel from interstate to take part in the giant hide and seek event.

The ban comes just a week after Amsterdam IKEA in Eindhoven were forced to cancel the bizarrely popular event citing safety concerns.

The idea of using an Ikea store for an adult game of hide and seek has been mooted for years, given the furniture stores' abundance of adult-sized hiding places.
