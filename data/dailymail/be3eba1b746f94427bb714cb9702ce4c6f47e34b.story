A Polish woman has been arrested on suspicion of killing at least five of her newborn babies, and hiding the bodies on her farm.

The 41-year-old woman, identified only as Beata Z, gave birth to eight babies between 1998 and 2012, but only two, aged seven and ten, remain alive, prosecutors in Lomza, eastern Poland said.

Four bodies have been recovered from in the attic, cellar and the stable of the farm in where Beata Z, a widow, lived with her new partner and the two living children.

Investigators are searching the farm in Hipolitowo village, outside Lomza, for a fifth body and are trying to determine the fate of the sixth baby.

Social workers alerted police this summer when they saw no baby born after Beata Z appeared to have been pregnant.

Ms Kudyba said: ‘We know that between 1998 and 2012, the woman gave birth to six children, four boys and two girls. They were born alive.

'We have established that five of them are dead. An investigation is under way to find out what happened to the sixth.’

Missing: Police are still searching for the fifth body, believed to be hidden on the farm, whilst trying to determine the fate of the sixth child

Investigation: Prosecutors in Lomza have established that five of six children born to Beata Z between 1998 and 2012 are dead

The woman will be held for at least three months during an investigation which will see autopsies carried out to confirm that Beata Z is the mother of the four dead babies.

She has been questioned regarding the events, but prosecutors would only confirm that she will undergo psychiatric examination.

Investigators refused to speculate about possible motives in the case, which has been widely covered by the Polish media.

The alleged crimes have shocked the predominantly Catholic nation, where terminations of pregnancies are strictly controlled.

Polish anti-abortion law only allows a termination if it threatens the life of the mother, the foetus is irreparably damaged, or the pregnancy resulted from a crime.
