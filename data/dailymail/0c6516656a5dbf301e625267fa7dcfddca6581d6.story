Chicken-Fish and Pickywickywoowoo are among the 20 most bizarre names that owners have given their cats and dogs, a survey has revealed.Â 

Alongside Pickywickywoowoo, cats' names 
are as outlandish as Princess Maisie Dolores, Strawberry Surprise,
and Mister Fuzzy Mittens.

Dog names ranged from the embarrassing to the peculiar, such as Toe-Jam, Chicken-Fish and Towpath Tidy.

Battersea Dogs and Cats Home put together its top 20 by asking its 225,000 Facebook and Twitter fans to give them the most bizarre pet names they knew.

Dog owners are getting creative: Battersea Dogs' Home has put together top the top 10 strangest dog names

Last year, Britain's most popular dog and cat name was plain old Charlie, but these owners are branching out and coming up with the most original names they can.

Rob Young, operations manager at Battersea, advised: 'Just remember you may need to shout it out in the garden or at the park.'

Because Battersea takes in around 9,000 dogs and cats every year, staff themselves have to come up with unusual names for their constant new arrivals.

Fancy cat names: Lullybellbells and Mister Fuzzy Mittens made the top 10

At the moment they have an Anatolian shepherd cross named Senor Snuggles, and a cat called Cuddle Bear.

Rob said: 'Around half of the dogs and cats we take in are strays so we have to come up with names. We have to be quite imaginative.'

He said they may even take inspiration from the names in their top 20.
