Eight people had to be rescued by the U.S. Coastguard in Hawaii after the boat they were on sank.

Four adults and four children traveling to Molokai from Oahu on Sunday afternoon were forced to abandon ship when boat they were in sank in the Kaiwi Channel.

'We knew it was going to go down so we just started getting anything that we really needed like life jackets and I put my fins on and we all jumped in the water and the boat went over,' said Jeff Kozlovich.

The group left Sandy Beach Park around 1:30 p.m. and brought along three kayaks and the plan was to kayak back to Oahu on Monday.

Nno injuries were reported among those rescued. The group was able to tie three kayaks together and cling to them before rescuers arrived Sunday

Those on board the 21-foot recreational vessel were wearing lifejackets at the time of the sinking in Kaiwi Channel

The boaters were rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter crew. A boat crew also was dispatched to the scene

They were 12 miles west of Molokai when their 21-foot vessel got hit by rough waters.

'Eventually it got scary rough real fast where waves were breaking over the bow and it happened really quick. Before we knew it, too much water was in the boat and we really couldn't steer well or maneuver,' Kozlovich said.

Just before the boat sunk, the crew used their cell phones to call 911.

Although they managed to get through, the Coast Guard says it was a special tracking device called a 'EPIRB' that helped save the day.

The Joint Rescue Coordination Center in Honolulu received a signal that people could be in trouble about 12 miles West of Molokai

EPIRB is an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon and is a safety device used to alert search and rescue services.

'It could have been bad...you have to have a lot of respect for that ocean and the wind and conditions out there can change very quickly,' said Kozlovich.

The Coast Guard advises not to rely on cell phones in the middle of the ocean. They say it's important to have the appropriate safety equipment.

All eight people were wearing their life jackets. No injuries were reported.

Although their cell reception worked, the United States Coast Guard says it was a special tracking device called a EPIRB - Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon - that was the hero of the day

Right before the boat sunk, the experienced waterman crew untied the kayaks from the boat then tied them all together and used their cell phones to call 911
