In their three-week reign, Queen Letizia and King Felipe have had a packed schedule of official engagements.

So a rare night off royal duty must be welcomed by the pair, who also parents two daughters, Leonor, eight, and Sofia, seven.

Taking advantage of their freedom, Letizia and Felipe were spotted enjoying a low-key evening at a cinema in Madrid.

Having taken in a movie, the pair left the building with a small group of friends, looking like any other couple out for the evening.

Now considered one of the world's most glamorous monarchs, Letizia is famous for her sharp dress sense.

But the normally glamorous Letizia dressed down in a pair of loose navy slacks, cropped at the ankle, and a white Hugo Boss T-shirt with the slogan ‘Stay cool stay orange’ across it in floral print.

Making the most of the balmy Spanish evening, the 41-year-old queen wore a pair of strappy flat gladiator sandals and slung her white jacket over her shoulder as she walked.

King Felipe, 46, wore blue jeans, a blue shirt and brown boat shoes , towering over his wife who was without her usual sky-high heels

Equally low key, King Felipe, 46, wore blue jeans, a blue shirt and brown boat shoes, towering over his petite wife, who had chosen not to wear her usual sky-high heels.

The couple's date night comes as they returned from a two-day tour of Morocco where they met King Mohammed VI and his wife Princess Lalla Salma.

They have been on a public relations blitz since Felipe ascended the throne a month ago, attending high-profile events nearly every day.Monarchists hope the new King and Queen will usher in a new era of popularity for the troubled Spanish royal household.
