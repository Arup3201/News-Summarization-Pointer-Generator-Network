The White House has voiced their disapproval after Samsung promoted a selfie with the president taken by a Boston Red Sox star while using a Samsung phone.

Designated hitter David 'Big Papi' Ortiz snapped the photo during an April 1 visit to the White House with his teammates as President Obama congratulated them for winning the 2013 World Series and posted it to Twitter.Â 

'What an honor, thanks for the selfie,' Ortiz wrote with the picture. It was soon retweeted by Samsung with the added comment 'Big Papi, Big Selfie' in a move that drew the ire of White House officials.

 drew the ire of administration officials after Samsung retweeted it in 
what appeared to be a promotion

'I can say that as a rule, the White House objects to attempts to use the president's likeness for commercial purposes,' Spokesman Jay Carney said during a Thursday media briefing. 'And we certainly object in this case.'

Carney didn't say whether the White House has asked Samsung to stop using the image.

Ortiz tweeted the picture of him with President Barack Obama to followers Tuesday after appearing to have been cajoled into the photo op after Obama said 'alright come on, let's get a good picture here,' according to CNN Money.

It has been retweeted by almost 42,000 people and favorited by another 48,000 in the days since.

Samsung retweeted the photo in an ad that has garnered fairly paltry numbers of engagement - only 510 retweets and 639 favorites. The company also tweeted that the photo was taken with a Samsung phone.#

The phone maker's caption was a play on a well-known promotional video for an MLB-sponsored children's charity a few years ago.

Major League Baseball shared the presidential pic and saw double the retweets and favorites Samsung has.

Ortiz claimed to the Boston Globe that the moment was spontaneous.

'That was one of those things that just happened,' said the slugger. 'I gave him the jersey, and the photographers were going to take their pictures and I thought, really at the last second, maybe I should snap a shot with my phone while I have the chance.'

Despite the three-time World Series champion signing an endorsement deal with Samsung a few months ago, he was adamant, 'it had nothing to do with no deals.'

A Samsung spokesperson told the Globe 
that it was 'thrilled to see the special, historic moment David Ortiz 
captured with his Galaxy Note 3 during his White House visit.'

The South Korean electronics giant also said that it 'worked with David and the team on how to share images with fans' upon learning of the White House visit.

Carney insisted that Obama 'had no idea' the pic would be used in a promotion by Samsung.

The company has a history of innovative promotions with selfies, including one with Ellen during the Oscars that is the most retweeted tweet of all-time.

Officials have objected to use of the president's image in prior advertisements, but have no legal basis to do so.
