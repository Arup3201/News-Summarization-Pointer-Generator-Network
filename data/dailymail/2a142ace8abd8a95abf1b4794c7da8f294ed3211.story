Tony Mozick Jr., 21, from Kent County, was arrested last week in connection with the grisly death of 19-year-old Taylor Michelle Owens, after detectives found her charred body on Saturday in a wooded area close to their home.

Mr Mozick Jr. was charged with first-degree murder on Sunday, according to Delaware police records.

Police have not released information on how Ms Owens was killed, however they believe it happened on August 31 after a fight at their home in the 200 block of Denny St. in Leipsic.

State police Sgt. Paul G. Shavack said they believe Mr Mozick Jr. then took her body to the wooded area, where he tried to dispose of it by burning it.

Ms Owens’ family had reported the Dover woman missing after she had not been seen or heard from since 4pm on August 31.

The last comment she posted on her Facebook wall was on August 31, saying: 'I work two jobs and still manage to go to school and achieve high honors, at least you can do is give me a little respect. I am so tired of everyone being so rude to me .. Your the one person I didn't expect it from.'

Ms Owens, who worked as a caregiver at the Delaware Institute of Pain Management, was the focus of a missing person’s investigation and was last seen in the Dover area wearing a pink shirt and black shorts.

Shortly after 5.30pm on Saturday, police were notified that possible charred human remains had been found in the wooded area.

Ms Owens’ remains have been turned over to the Chief Medical Examiner in the state for an autopsy.

Mr Mozick Jr.’s grandmother, Linda Mozick, said her grandson and Ms Owens had been dating for around a year and had known each other for a few years during high school.

‘We’re totally shocked,’ she told Delaware Online. ‘We don’t know anything about what happened yet because the police aren’t done with their investigation.’

This is the second brutal murder that has taken place within the troubled family in the past year. 

Culprits: Lovers Gerard T Schweiger and Jennifer Barnes collaborated to throw Tony Mozick Sr's body into the Delaware River

On August 29, two days before Ms Owens was last seen, Mr Mozick Jr.’s 23-year-old sister, Jennifer Barnes, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for helping her boyfriend dispose of her father's body, after he allegedly stabbed him multiple times. 

Ms Barnes was found guilty of helping to hide the body of the disabled 45-year-old Tony Mozick Sr.'s in a plastic container before throwing it off a bridge and into a river in Delaware in January.

It unclear what kind of disability he had.

Gerard T Schweiger, the father of one of Barnes's four children, was charged with first-degree murder for killing Mr Mozick Sr. at his home after an argument.

Mr Schweiger, of Felton, was also charged with deadly weapons possession and abuse of a corpse.

He is scheduled to go on trial for the murder of Mr Mozick Sr. in April next year, where Barnes is expected to testify against him.

Ms Owens commented on her Facebook on August 29, two days before she was killed: 'Ok, I swear if I hear one more thing about Jen's trial, I will snap.

'Do you even realize what the family is still going through? I said this before, and i will say it again, I think only one person knows the truth and he's not around.'

In July 2012 Mr Mozick Jr. was arrested along with
his father, Mr Mozick Sr., and two others for growing marijuana plants,
found in Mr Mozick Sr.'s house.

'The four marijuana plants were approximately 6 - 8 feet high and weighed a total of 8 lbs', said the police report.

Detectives also searched Mr Mozick Jr.'s home on Denny St - which he shared with Ms Owens and two other men, Jeremy Delinois, Louis J. Bourdon - where they found 'an additional marijuana plant weighing approximately 15 grams, two 12 gauge shotguns and various drug paraphernalia'.

Mr Mozick Jr is currently being held without bond at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center,, pending the investigation into Ms Owens' death.
