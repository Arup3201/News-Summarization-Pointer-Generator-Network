President Robert Mugabe may remain in power for a further ten years after signing a new constitution

President Robert Mugabe may be able to extend his 33-year-old rule over Zimbabwe for another ten years after signing a new constitution today.

The law, which was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum in March, clips the powers of the president and imposes a two-term limit.

However, it does not apply retroactively 
so the 89-year-old Mugabe could technically extend his three decades in 
office by another ten years.

The constitution replaces a document forged in the dying days of white minority rule and paves the way for an election later this year.

A beaming Mugabe, flanked by Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, his main political rival, and Deputy President Joice Mujuru signed multiple copies of the charter at State House in the capital Harare to cheers and applause from aides.

The constitution was formed as part of a power-sharing deal between Mugabe and Tsvangirai after disputed and violent elections in 2008.

The five-year coalition government formed under the same agreement expires on June 29, and parliamentary.

Mugabe has vowed to hold fair and open elections and a presidential vote could be held as early as August 14.

Zimbabwe is hosting a worldwide United Nations tourism summit in 
mid-August, suggesting that nationwide polls would take place in 
September after what is expected to be the world's largest tourism 
exposition.

However, many obstacles remain, 
including finding the estimated $130million needed to pay for the 
election and reaching agreement on outside monitors.

Harare has turned down offers of United Nations or donor assistance.

Mugabe said: 'This is a happening of joy, great joy indeed,' according to Sky News.

He said today that the new 
constitution shows that Zimbabweans are united, regardless of political 
affiliation and without outside interference.

Mugabe accused some in the 15-nation 
Southern African Development Community (SADC), which has been mediating 
in the crisis, of trying to impose their will on Harare.

'We rejected this,' he told reporters after the signing ceremony, adding that any vote would be fair and peaceful.

'We will ensure that there won't be any violence, that there won't be any rigging.'

In brief remarks, Tsvangirai said the
charter had set the southern African country 'on a new path' after 
nearly a decade of economic decline and political violence that started 
in 2000 with the seizure of white-owned commercial farms by Mugabe 
supporters.

He said: 'As Zimbabweans we are proud that we are setting on a journey that is based on a new governance system.'

They did not take questions from reporters.

State media said today that Mugabe was pressing for a vote before July.

His rivals want it delayed to allow for the opening up of broadcast media, registration of new voters and reform of the military to ensure it stays out of politics.

Several parts of the new constitution are effective immediately with 
others set to come into force after the swearing in of the next elected 
administration.

Mugabe was voted into power in 1980 after the British brokered peace talks in London following a civil war that saw the end of white minority rule.

The pro-independence leader Mugabe and his Zanu party win the elections.
