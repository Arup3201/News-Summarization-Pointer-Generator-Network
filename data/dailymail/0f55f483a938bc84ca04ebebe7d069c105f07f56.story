In a poignant ceremony Saturday, the family of a Marine killed in the Afghanistan war adopted the bomb-sniffing dog that was by his side throughout his last days.

The ceremony, held at Camp Pendleton, near San Diego, California, was to honor Staff Sergeant Christopher Diaz, 27, who was killed September 2011 while deployed in the Helmand province of Afghanistan.

The dog, a six-year old Belgian malinois named Dino, was deployed with Diaz in Afghanistan. He was uninjured in attack that killed Diaz.

The family traveled to the military base to adopt Dino, who was pictured with their son in a photograph he sent from Afghanistan before he was killed. Dino was officially retired by the military, and given tests to ensure that he did not suffer from the canine equivalent of post-traumatic stress disorder.

'I don't think that it will decrease any of the pain we feel,'Â  Diaz's 
father, Salvador Diaz, told the Los Angeles Times. 'He's not 
going to replace Christopher but he'll give us something that 
Christopher loved, the Marine Corps.'

'It's going to be helpful - we'll have something to hold on to.' said Sandra Diaz, his mother.

Following the ceremony, which was attended by half a dozen close relatives, the family brought Dino back to their home in El Paso, Texas, where they have a large backyard with a swimming pool.

'Dino will be our baby,' Sandra Diaz said.

Before deploying to Afghanistan, Diaz and Dino had worked together at Twentynine Palms, a Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center. There, the two developed a bond, which continued up until his death during combat operations.

Born and trained in Israel, Dino takes commands in Hebrew but also 
understands English, according to Sgt. Jonathan Overland, who took over as 
Dino's handler. Overland also attended the ceremony.

According to the LA Times, the Marine Corps needed approval from
 the secretary of the Navy in order to proceed with the adoption.

The law permits such an adoption if it will 
help a family with the grieving process and if the dog is considered a 
good candidate for adoption.

The testing was performed by specialists at Lackland Air Force Base in San Anotonio, Texas, a military dog training school. The results showed that Dino was of the right temperament to be adopted by the Diaz's.
