A Texas woman who is among the 100 million affected by December’s massive Target stores security breach says she’s since received a credit card in the mail that bears another woman’s photo.

Houston dermatologist Lauren Campbell learned that someone had opened lines of credit in her name at multiple area retailers just days after Target said her confidential information may have been compromised.

After spending weeks trying to preserve her identity, Campbell received the shocking piece of mail this past weekend: a Costco American Express card in her name but with the face of someone else.

Shocked: A Houston woman whose personal information was hacked as part of December's massive Target breach received a Costco American Express card bearing another woman's photo over the weekend

Connected? Dermatologist Lauren Campbell says she's been battling an identity thief since just days after learning Target may have leaked her sensitive information

‘I’m looking at the card,’ she recalled to KHOU. ‘And I turned it over and there’s her picture.’

While there is no direct link between the information stolen from Target and her most recent troubles, what matters to Campbell now is bringing the nightmare to a close.

‘Someone’s gone to like 20 stores and pretended to be me,’ she said. ‘They have a fake ID. They have a fake social security card. I mean, it’s just horrible.’

Campbell isn’t the only consumer who fears her hacked information has or will lead to thefts.

Where's the info? Up to 110 million Target customers were affected in the credit card data heist from its stores at the end of last year and fears linger on that stolen information has landed in the hands of thieves across America

A recent Mexican border bust of a couple carrying dozens of credit cards containing the stolen information of South Texans had authorities fearing a widespread dissemination of the Target information had occurred.

While any link between the crimes has since been refuted, further investigation into the Target hack has revealed additional potential victims and roped in retail giant Neiman-Marcus as a second target of December’s breach, according to CNN.

In five days, Campbell’s identity thief managed to burn through $30,000 in fraudulently charged diamond rings, children’s toys at Toys R Us and other loot.

Speaking out: The thief was able to spend $30,000 with a temporary card before Campbell ever received the shocking evidence. Now she's taken the proof to local news stations to help police nab the culprit

And it was all on a temporary credit card before Campbell received the faked card in the mail.

She learned of the charges beforehand and says she spent an estimated 40 hours on the phone sorting out the mess with retailers and police.

Then she received the card in the mail and decided to try and bring the culprit to justice.

Campbell took her evidence to all her local news stations and asked that they tell her story.

‘Someone out there in my hometown – Houston is my hometown, I’m a native Houstonian – is running around pretending to be me, opening up accounts, charging other people money, using my name to commit crime,’ she said. ‘That really bothers me.’
