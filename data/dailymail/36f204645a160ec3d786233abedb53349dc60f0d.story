The terrifying moment a group of fearless storm chasers headed into the eye of a tornado has been caught on camera.

The group were travelling along a road in Arkansas in hailstorms, directly towards the center of the deadly weather system which has left a 30-mile path of destruction across the state.Â 

In the video, the driver and passengers are heard shouting 'we are in it right now' and 'my ears are popping' as they approach the enormous cloud.

Destruction: The storm, which has left 16 people dead in Arkansas and one in Oklahoma has turned over cars and ripped up trees in its path

They then pull over as the sound of hailstones hitting the car gets louder and the sky turns black.

As
 they come to a halt, the driver switches off the engine while the car 
is in a layby and the passengers sit and wait for the tornado to reach 
them.

At least 17
 people have died after the powerful storm system spawning several 
twisters tore through the central and southern states.

Torn down: The tornado has created a 30-mile path of destruction across Arkansas

Experts warned that another hundred tornadoes could hit the central states this week at the start of tornado season.

Yesterday tornado watches - which means twisters 
could develop but are not an immediate threat - were in effect for states
 as far west as New Mexico and as far east as Tennessee and the system 
produced storms that were moving through the region in waves.

Television
 footage showed buildings that had been turned to rubble and trees that 
had been stripped bare of their leaves and smaller branches.
