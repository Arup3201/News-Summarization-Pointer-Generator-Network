The 2014 World Cup hosts came up against fellow South Americans Colombia at the Sun Life Gardens in Florida during the early hours of Saturday morning.

Neymar, who captained Brazil for the first time since being given the armband on a permanent basis by national team boss Dunga, scored the only goal of the game in the 83rd minute to hand his side the win.

The 22-year-old forward showed he was over his World Cup heartache by accepting an apology from Colombia defender Juan Zuniga - the man who played a part in his premature end to his participation at the tournament.
