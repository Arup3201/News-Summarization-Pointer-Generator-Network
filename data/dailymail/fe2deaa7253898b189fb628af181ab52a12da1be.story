Two British women are to appear in court to defend the man charged with raping them in Barbados.

University researcher Rachel Turner, 30, and retired primary school teacher Diane Davies, 63, are leading the fight to free Derick Crawford, who is accused of raping them in identical attacks on the Caribbean island.

Crawford is said to claim a confession was beaten out of him.

Savage: Mrs Davies' face was bruised and swollen after the attack, which left her with a broken collarbone and ribs

The women are so adamant he was not 
their attacker that they have waived their anonymity to insist publicly 
that police have arrested the wrong man. The latest hearing in the case 
is due to take place today.

Dr Turner, from Letchworth, 
Hertfordshire, says their rapist is 10 to 15 years younger and bears no 
resemblance to Mr Crawford, 48, who has already spent 18 months in jail 
awaiting trial.

This week, the women met their alleged
attacker for the first time after he was granted bail at a preliminary 
hearing – and said they were now ‘100 per cent’ sure it was not him. In 
an emotional meeting outside the courthouse, Mr Crawford thanked the 
‘very brave’ women for their support.

Dr Turner moved to Barbados in 2010, to take up an environmental research post at the University of West Indies.

She was walking along a beach in Holetown in October that year when she was dragged into a deserted hotel building and raped.

Two days later Mrs Davies, who was on 
holiday, was raped as she walked along the same beach path. The widow 
and grandmother-of-nine, who lives in Anglesey, North Wales, suffered a 
broken collarbone and ribs.

Photo-fits of their attacker were so 
similar that police initially mixed them up. But when officers arrested 
Mr Crawford and asked the victims to identify him, both knew instantly 
it was the wrong man.

They say their protests were ignored 
and that Mr Crawford was charged anyway to save the island’s reputation 
as a holiday destination.

Following her extraordinary meeting with Mr Crawford, Dr Turner said: ‘I am so happy and relieved now I have finally met him.

‘If I was 99 per cent sure he was the 
wrong man, now I am 100 per cent. I have no doubts at all – this is not 
the man who attacked me. Everything about him is wrong. He doesn’t fit 
the appearance of my attacker in any way. He told us police beat him and
put a bag over his head to make him sign the confession.’

Mrs Davies, who returned to the island
for the court case, said: ‘I have stated categorically that is not the 
man who attacked me.

Convinced: Rachel Turner and Diane Davies say police have ignored their insistence that Derick Crawford is not the man who attacked them

Speaking out: The women have waived their right to anonymity to speak out as they believe the real rapist is still at large

‘He is older and his features are 
totally different. We both, independently of each other, said he was in 
his early to mid-thirties.’

Mr Crawford described meeting the pair
as ‘very emotional’. He said: ‘I know that they want the real  rapist 
caught … he is still out there running around.’

He was only able to apply for bail 
after 1970s actress Hilary Heath, 67, heard about the case and paid for 
him to be represented by Andrew Pilgrim, president of the Barbados Bar 
Association.

Mrs Heath, now an addiction councillor, was raped at knifepoint when a masked intruder broke into her Barbados home in 2004.
