Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson fired an amazing 10 birdies in succession to claim a third straight win in the 40th Ryder Cup, but it was Europe's only success as the United States fought back on Saturday.

After two victories on the opening day, Rose and Stenson were sent out first in the morning fourballs by captain Paul McGinley and responded with a stunning display of golf to beat Bubba Watson and Matt Kuchar 3&2.

The home pair were 12 under par for 16 holes and their American opponents nine under in defeat in a record-setting contest as the players revelled in the calmer conditions at Gleneagles.

However, Jim Furyk and Hunter Mahan then combined to beat Lee Westwood and Jamie Donaldson 4&3 and rookie pair Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed thrashed Thomas Bjorn and Martin Kaymer 5&3 to reduce the gap.

And it took some belated heroics from Ryder Cup talisman Ian Poulter to ensure he and Rory McIlroy claimed half a point against Jimmy Walker and Rickie Fowler to keep the home side in front by 6 1/2 to 5 1/2.

Poulter holed a pitch from short of the 15th green for birdie to avoid going two down and also birdied the par-five 16th, but by that stage had already been left out of the afternoon foursomes.

'Late delivery, second class post,' said Poulter, a reference to his nickname of 'The Postman' because he always delivers a point in the biennial contest. 

'I made a couple of quick birdies to start off which was nice and then fell asleep in the middle.

'Holing that (pitch on 15) and turning one over on the next makes a massive difference.'

There was plenty to celebrate for Justin Rose on Saturday morning. He's on course to become the first European player to win five points in one Ryder Cup 

With Stenson sitting out the foursomes to rest a niggling back problem, McGinley sent Donaldson and Westwood out for the third session running to face Zach Johnson and Kuchar, with Kaymer joining an inspired Rose in the second match against Spieth and Reed.

McIlroy and Sergio Garcia had been due out second but their match against Furyk and Mahan was moved down the order to allow McIlroy time to rest, with the final match between Victor Dubuisson and Graeme McDowell and Walker and Fowler delayed by 15 minutes.

That meant Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley sat out the entire day, while Stephen Gallacher also missed out after a fourball defeat with Poulter on Friday.

Back issue or not, Stenson started his and Rose's recovery from two down after six with a birdie on the seventh and Rose birdied the next to get the home pair back on level terms.

It was a thumbs up from Ian Poulter as he and Rory McIlroy staged a stirring comeback to halve their match with Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker 

But it was a rough morning in more ways than one for Thomas Bjorn. The Dane and Martin Kaymer were on the end of a thrashing from Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed

Both players birdied the par-five ninth and Rose birdied the 10th and 11th as well, although that was only good enough to stay level in a match of the highest quality.

Stenson's birdie on the 12th took Europe ahead for the first time - Rose was also within five feet of the hole - and another Rose birdie on the next put them two ahead.

Stenson maintained that advantage by matching Watson's birdie on the 14th and the Swede looked to have struck a decisive blow when his approach to the next left a tap-in, only for Kuchar to hole from 30 feet across the green for a half.

However, Rose produced another superb pitch to three feet on the par-five 16th to seal a remarkable win.

'It might be a highlight to put on the big screen with the grandkids one day,' Stenson admitted. 'I was lucky enough to be there and back Justin up on a couple of occasions.'
