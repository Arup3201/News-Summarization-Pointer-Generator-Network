Roberto Martinez insists Everton have not received any offers for Ross Barkley and will not sell him during the January window.

Manchester City, who have a long-term interest in the England international, have once again been linked with a big-money move for Barkley but Martinez has made it clear Everton will not be cashing in.

Everton have endured their worst run of form for nine years and Martinez is more concerned about addressing how they recapture last season's sparkle than losing Barkley in the coming weeks.

Barkley signed a new long-term contract in the summer and though he has only shown sporadic flashes of his talent this year, his manager has attempted to put an end to the speculation ahead of Tuesday's FA Cup third-round tie with West Ham.

Martinez said: 'We have not received any approach. This January it is vital we recapture our best form and regain some momentum. If our best performers get compliments, we enjoy hearing those compliments and that is good but nobody will be leaving.

'Ross is someone with real passion for the game. You would always pay a good entrance fee to watch someone like him. But we are just concentrating on getting the result against West Ham. This is a real important moment in our season to make progress in another competition.

'The players and everyone at the club are only thinking about what we can do. The talent is there. We have been through a difficult period of bad results and we need to make sure we fulfil our potential. That is where we are. This is the most important game of the season.

'January is always an opportunity to see if there are opportunities so you can help the other players at the club. We have got a good group and we want to be ready for the challenges that we are going to face in the second half of the season. We are not going to bring anyone in just for the sake of it.'

If Everton do sign anyone this month, the priority will be a goalkeeper as Tim Howard faces another 'six or seven weeks' on the sidelines and Joel Robles is the only keeper with top-flight experience at the club. 

But the FA Cup is a more pressing concern. Beating West Ham, however, is likely to prove easier said than done. Everton have lost their last four matches in the Barclays Premier League and Martinez is wary of the threat Sam Allardyce's side pose.

'It could be a pivotal moment and that is the way we are looking at it,' said Martinez. 'I admire West Ham and Southampton for the way they have done things in the Premier League, they have been phenomenal.

'We have been disappointed with the results, because we had high hopes and expectations. We have got three games at home and we need to get the positive result that will trigger that momentum. I am very much looking forward to that game.'

Given they began the season with great expectations, Martinez – who will again be without the hamstrung James McCarthy – has found himself coming under fire from frustrated Evertonians but he understands why he finds himself under pressure.

'That is normal,' said Martinez. 'We are here to win football games and build something for the future. The fans know we are all together. When you have adversity, you have to find a way of making sure you become a winning side. It is time to help each other and we will get our rewards.'
