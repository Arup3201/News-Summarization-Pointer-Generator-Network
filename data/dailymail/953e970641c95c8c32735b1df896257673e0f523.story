Waste: Women will throw away £26 of unwanted Christmas beauty gifts, totalling £676million, every year, according to new research

Nine out of ten British women will receive beauty products from loved ones this Christmas – but a jaw-dropping £676million worth will never be used, according to a poll.

The average British woman will throw away two Christmas beauty gifts, worth an average of £26, according to new research by teeth-whitening brand Blanx.

One in five UK women admit they will discard even more unwanted Christmas beauty gifts, totalling up to an eye-popping value of £60, this year.

Senior Brand Manager for Blanx, Louise Marks: 'Men be warned. If that designer lipstick, the one that just cost you a fortune, isn’t your lady’s preferred colour or that make-up you just ordered from a bespoke beauty house in Paris is a shade too light, it doesn’t matter that it took you three weeks to source and order it, it’s going to land in a bin sooner rather than later.'

While the average UK woman buys almost three new beauty products for herself per month they tend to stick to the same tried and tested brands they know and trust.

More than seven out of 10 women say they continue to buy the same beauty products because of 'positive usage'.

Meanwhile, just over 12 per cent buy on the recommendation of others. A further 18.5 per cent buy the same beauty brands out of loyalty and some 24.7 per cent buy the same brands because of habit.

Buyer beware: If it's not the right shade or brand for the lady, it's probably destined for the bin

Ms Marks added: 'British women are very loyal to their favourite brands and tend to want to stick with the beauty products they know and love.

'They very rarely choose a new beauty product based on a recommendation from others and choose their make-up and other beauty essentials out of habit, loyalty and, most importantly, because it has had a positive result for them in the past.

'Men need to be aware that it is easy to get it wrong when buying beauty products for their ladies at Christmas and British women are not scared of being ruthless when it comes to their beauty regime.'
