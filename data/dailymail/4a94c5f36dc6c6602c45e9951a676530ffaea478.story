The family of the two Amish girls, age 7 and 12, who were abducted by a man and woman on a 'shopping trip' for slaves, are building a garage for the couple who safely returned the girls to their home.

Jeffrey and Pamela Stinson of Bigelow, New York, received the shock of their life on August 14, when the two missing girls, who they recognized from news reports, knocked on their door, about 15 miles from where they disappeared near their family farm stand in Oswegatchie, New York.

Mr Stinson gave the girls, who he said were wet, cold, and still in their traditional Amish attire, some watermelon and juice, and then, after a long discussion with his wife, decided it was better to drive the girls home rather than alert the police.

He also said he recognized the oldest girl as he had purchased corn from her at the farm stand. 

'We never gave it any thought about implications or dangers,' he said. 'We knew they had to get home.'

Now, as a sign of gratitude, the Amish are doing what they do best, and raising a barn for the couple.

The Stinsons told the Watertown Daily Times that the garage at their home in St. Lawrence County recently burned down while they were on vacation in Maine, and, after learning this, the family of the girls said they would be building them a new one later this week.

The fire was believed to have been started by a stray cat knocking over a battery jumpstart box inside. 

The victims, their 11 siblings, parents, grandparents and other relatives are expected to be on hand for the big barn raising, Mr Stinson said, and they would be offended if they could not rebuild the couple's garage. 

The Stinsons decided against alerting the authroites, and instead drove the girls home to their family

'They won't take no for an answer,' he said. 

The girls were abducted on August 13 while tending to their family's farm stand near Oswegatchie. Stephen Howells II, 39, and his girlfriend, 25-year-old Nicole Vaisey, lured the girls to their parked car saying they wanted to show them a puppy, then forcing the two into the back of their vehicle and speeding off to their home in Hermon.

The couple chained the girls to a bed and sexually abused them for 24-hours before getting nervous about all the news coverage of the girls' disappearance and dropping them off in Bigelow, where the luckily found their way to the home of the Stinsons.

Authorities arrested the Howells and Vesey on August 15, and they have now been charged with intending to sexually abuse or physically harm the girls, and two counts of first-degree kidnapping. 

During a hearing on Thursday in a St Lawrence County, NY court, Vaisey revealed that she and Howell were on a 'shopping trip' for slaves.

Her attorney is claiming she was in a 'master-slave relationship' with her boyfriend, and therefore not as culpable for the crime. 

'She was the submissive one,' Vaisey's attorney, Bradford Riendeau, stated last week. 'I am currently researching on what happens when prisoners of war go through enhanced interrogation. What torture has done to her personality to determine just how compliant she was? Was it really voluntary? Can you really give consent to be tortured?'

Howells waived his right to a hearing, so that his case may go straight to a grand jury.
