Ezequiel Lavezzi caused a storm on Twitter after compromising pictures emerged of the Paris Saint-Germain striker wearing little more than a policeman's hat.

The Argentina international is on an extended holiday following his efforts at the World Cup and, by the looks of it, he is enjoying his time off.

He is pictured with a lady friend - believed to be his partner - and appears to have her foot to his ear.

Twitter reacted with customary speed and wit, and inevitably it wasn't long before Ashley Cole appeared lurking in the background as fans scrambled to mock-up viral pictures.

Cole was ridiculed after he lingered awkwardly on the fringes of Roma's team photo after joining the Serie A side last month.

Lavezzi, 29, found the net 12 times for PSG last season as they won a League and League Cup double and appears keen to continue his scoring streak this campaign.
