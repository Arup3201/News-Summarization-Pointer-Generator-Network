The number of men opting for beard transplants has rocketed in the past year, according to new research.

Figures have revealed that the amount of men having the procedure - which usually involves patching up areas rather than transplanting an entire beard - has risen by 13 per cent in just 12 months.

The facial hair transplant is now three times as popular as the rhinoplasty or nose-job among men.

This shows how a facial hair transplant can help fill in sparse patches of hair, such as in the sideburns. Most men opt for patch transplants rather than entire beard transplants, according to surgeons

It is thought that the celebrity trend for facial hair is driving the boom, with famous faces such as Gary Barlow and Brad Pitt proving to be influential.

Recently Newsnight's Jeremy Paxman caused a Twitter storm after he was seen to be sporting a full bush of beard growth after returning from holiday.

One patient to have had the novel surgery is a 48-year-old farmer, who chose to have a hair transplant to fill in his meagre sideburns.

Gary Barlow 24 per cent

David Beckham 20 per cent

George Clooney 13 per cent

Brad Pitt 11 per cent

Jeremy Paxman 10 per cent

Tom Selleck 8 per cent

Ewan McGregor 6 per cent

Ashton Kutcher 4 per cent

Zach Galifianakis 3 per cent

Richard Branson 1 per cent

He said he had 'always felt his masculinity had been undermined by not being able to grow proper "mutton chops".'

His operation was carried out by the Crown Clinic's surgeon Asim Shahmalak,
who has also performed hair transplants on a number of celebrities.

During the operation hair was harvested from the back of his head via follicular unit 
extraction (FUE), where individual hairs are taken and implanted into the area being treated.

The procedure usually takes around three hours.

During the unnamed patient's procedure specifically, Mr Shahmalak transplanted 200 grafts - there are between one and three hairs in each graft - into each of the patient's sideburns.

Mr Shahmalak claimed he had witnessed a 25 per cent rise in the number of procedures over 
the last three years as beards have become more fashionable.

Celebrities including Gary Barlow (left) and Brad Pitt (right) are 
thought to have fuelled the boom in facial hair transplants. The 
procedure is now three times more popular than the male rhinoplasty or 
nose-job

He said: 'A proper, full-grown beard has been the ultimate definition of masculinity for centuries.

'But many
men struggle to grow beards, sideburns and moustaches.

'They have 
significant gaps in their facial hair and the end result can look patchy
and unconvincing.

He added that patchy facial hair was often a genetic problem. He said: 'If the father had trouble growing a beard then there is a good chance the son will also have patchy facial hair.

Dr Shahmalak has carried out two hair transplants on Embarrassing Bodies star Christian Jessen.

Dr Jessen turned to him after being taunted on Twitter about his thinning hair.

And Mr Shahmalak isn't the only person to wiotness a shrp rise in business.

Having
pioneered the world’s first facial hair transplant in 1996, Dr Bessam 
Farjo, founder of The Farjo Hair Institute, claims he has seen a 
six-fold year on year increase in the amount of men having surgery to 
boost their facial follicles over the last five years.

Trendsetter? Jeremy Paxman caused a media storm when he appeared on Newsnight with a hairy accessory on his face

He said: 'A full beard is very much a statement look, and it goes in and out of fashion. For the last 12 to 18 months, there has been a noticeable rise in the number of men coming to my practice wanting to fill in bald patches or thicken wisps of hair.'

According to the International Society of hair Restoration, more than 4,500 procedures were carried out in the UK last year, 13 per cent more than those performed the previous year.

This is over 300 per cent more than the 1,043 rhinoplasties undergone by men in the UK during the same year.

But while having a full face of bristles may boost a man's self esteem, the effect appears to be lost on many women.

A
recent survey of how beards are perceived by the opposite sex found that two-thirds of women preferred the clean-shaven look to a 
beard.

However, no hair isn't necessarily better -  the poll revealed that 48 per cent of women found stubble sexier than a bare face.

It is thought hirsute celebrities including Gary Barlow, Brad Pitt and even Jeremy Paxman are driving the trend for hairier faces
