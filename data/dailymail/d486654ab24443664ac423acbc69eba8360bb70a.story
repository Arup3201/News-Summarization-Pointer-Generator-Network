Four young children were today being cared for by friends after their father was arrested on suspicion of stabbing their mother to death.

The woman, named locally as Raheela Imran, 41, was pronounced dead by paramedics at her large, end-of-terrace home at 4.50pm yesterday.

Thames Valley Police were called and a man, named locally as the victim’s husband Imran Sharif, who celebrated his 44th birthday last Monday was arrested on suspicion of murder today.

The semi-detached property where the family lived in Slough, Berks, was cordoned off with police standing guard as forensic investigators searched the red brick home for clues.

The next door house, which was owned by the couple but rented out to tenants, was also cordoned off.

A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: “They had three daughters and a son, the youngest was about four and the eldest 13 or 14.

“They were great people, it is really shocking. I didn’t sleep the whole night as a lot was going on.

“There were 15 police cars and vans down here from about 5pm.”

Another neighbour said the couple, who were originally from Pakistan, had lived at the house for 12 years and Mrs Imran worked part-time at Curry’s electrical store in Bath Road, Slough.

A resident of neighbouring Bell Close said: “I walk my dog around past the house and the kids were always outside playing, there were always lots of people running in and out.

“The children always came out and played with my dog. I really hope they weren’t around to see anything.”

Detective Chief Inspector Mike Lynch, from Thames Valley Police’s Major Crime Team, said: “Our investigations are at an early stage and we are currently working to establish the circumstances around the death.

“We are carrying out extensive forensic investigation at the scene and a scene watch remains in place.

“A 44-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently in custody.

“The victim and the man arrested are known to each other.

“I would like to reassure the local community that there is no cause for concern during the increased police presence in the area, while the investigation is on-going and thank them for their cooperation.”

A post-mortem examination, carried out by a Home Office pathologist, to establish the exact cause of death was expected to take place later today.
