All the elements required for a proper party were present and correct at Celtic Park. Amid the tickertape and the fireworks, and in front of heroes old and new, Neil Lennon’s side signed off their season with little touches of class.

Parkhead resounded to the celebration of three-in-a-row long before Scott Brown hoisted the Premiership trophy high above his head. With 102 goals scored and 99 points amassed – 20 more than last season – this has been about as convincing a title defence as it is possible to stage.

Many of the reasons why were on display as Dundee United were vanquished to ensure the optimum atmosphere in which to toast another triumph.

The resistance of the Tannadice side 
was broken by a 21st goal of the season for Anthony Stokes, who has been
 a key element of the Celtic attack. Even more prolific has been double 
Player of the Year award winner Kris Commons, so it was fitting he 
should net the final goal of their campaign to hoist his personal tally 
to a remarkable 32.

In 
between, there was time for the distribution of a leaving gift. Having 
emerged from the bench to win a penalty, Georgios Samaras was handed the
 honour by regular taker Commons. He made no mistake to draw an 
individual ovation from the crowd that appeared to leave him with tears 
in his eyes. The Greek international is out of contract and claims he is
 departing after six-and-a-half years because of the lack of a formal 
offer from the Celtic hierarchy.

An
 unfortunate own goal from Filip Twardzik was the only small negative 
during the match, but it was rendered irrelevant by the time John 
Hartson and Stilian Petrov emerged to lead the presentation party after 
full-time.

Both men, 
who have fought serious health issues, are former team-mates of Lennon 
from the days when Martin O’Neill and Gordon Strachan filled the 
manager’ s role. The current incumbent has now joined Strachan, Jock 
Stein and Willie Maley in an elite band of Celtic bosses to have won 
three successive championships. With a sea of green flags swaying in the
 stands, Lennon was given a cheer as loud as any.

United,
 of course, hope to have a party of their own back here on Saturday. And
 their team selection was hugely influenced by that impending date with 
destiny in the Scottish Cup final against St Johnstone.

Andrew
 Robertson, Nadir Ciftci, Gary Mackay-Steven and Stuart Armstrong all 
started on the bench as Jackie McNamara gave vital legs some additional 
rest before a game that could define their season.

Lennon
 changed more than half of his side following the midweek 3-3 draw with 
St Johnstone, but that was a case of restoring Celtic far closer to full
 strength. The only real surprise was a first start since September 2012
 for Czech youngster Twardzik, who was asked to slot in at left-back.

All
 in the Parkhead side wore black armbands in memory of little Oscar 
Knox, the five-year-old Celtic fan who passed away earlier this week 
after a two-and-a-half year battle against an aggressive form of cancer.

A
 tribute to his all-too-short life formed a profoundly poignant prelude 
to the celebrations which followed. Oscar’s image was displayed on the 
giant screens inside Parkhead before kick-off as the ground reverberated
 to a heartfelt rendition of ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’.

On
 the field, the game developed at a decidedly end-of-season pace. Celtic
 carried the greater threat and their first real opportunity arrived 
when Leigh Griffiths escaped down the left flank and tried to catch out 
Radoslaw Cierzniak at a tight angle. The Polish goalkeeper was, however,
 wise to his intentions and turned the ball behind for a corner.

United
 sought to maximise their counter-attacks and might well have snatched 
the lead after 20 minutes. Ryan Gauld advanced into central space in 
front of the home penalty area, all the time glancing to his right to 
see Ryan Dow charge forward in support. Gauld’s pass was perfectly 
weighted but, rather than strike first-time, Dow took a touch that 
enabled Efe Ambrose to block out any real danger.

Griffiths
 and Stokes continue to lurk with menace for the remainder of the 
opening period but couldn’t produce anything that caused Cierzniak 
excessive concern. Shots from awkward positions and distance were often 
the end product.

Things 
were even quieter for Fraser Forster, but United finally drew him into 
action five minutes after the restart. Mark Wilson, back on his old 
stomping ground, worked a short corner routine with Dow before sending 
Stefan Johansen the wrong way with a nimble dummy. That opened the way 
for a low shot that Forster pushed out, with the goalkeeper then 
relieved to see Farid El Alagui spoon the rebound too high.

Griffiths
 had the ball in the other net seconds later, only for an offside flag 
to truncate his celebrations. It was his final act before being replaced
 by Samaras with 30 minutes remaining.

All
 of a sudden, Celtic seemed to find greater potency. Charlie Mulgrew 
burst clear of a trio of Tannadice players nipping at his ankles before 
picking out Commons. He surged forward to angle in a drive that 
Cierzniak denied at his near post.

Then,
 on 64 minutes, the breakthrough arrived as Celtic made it into treble 
figures for Premiership goals. Commons whipped in a deep delivery from 
the right that found the United centre-backs wanting. It was too high 
for Samaras but Stokes was right behind him to head into the far corner 
of the net.

The visitors
 tried to stage a swift response. Armstrong, on for Dow, was fluid as he
 moved in from the left, but his low attempt from the fringe of the area
 was expertly tipped wide by Forster.

Instead,
 McNamara’s men found themselves two down with 14 minutes to go as 
Samaras offered up a little souvenir of his Celtic career. A poor touch 
from Armstong allowed Stokes to gather and thread a pass in the 
direction of the Greek. He did superbly to win a sliding challenge with 
Gavin Gunning before being toppled as he tried to round Cierzniak.

Samaras took the penalty himself – amid chanting of his name - and calmly planted it in the net.

United briefly threatened a comeback when a cutback from Mackay-Steven was deflected past Forster by the unfortunate Twardzik.

Celtic,
 though, restored their two-goal advantage with nine minutes remaining. A
 slip by Keith Watson left Commons clean through and his casual dink 
beyond Cierzniak was confirmation of a player at the peak of his powers.
