They are famous for going mad in March – but it seems this pair of mountain hares simply could not wait the extra two weeks.

The animals were photographed tussling in the Cairngorms in Scotland, and despite still being in their white winter coats their antics are a sign that spring is finally on its way.

While it is often thought that boxing takes place solely between males vying for dominance, this particular battle involved an angry female fighting of unwanted male attention.

Springing into action: These two hares were spotted sparring in the Cairngorms, Scotland, by photographer Andy Howard

Angry: The female (pictured on the right of the pair) appears unhappy with the attention shown by the male hare

Glutton for punishment: The determined male continues to try his luck before giving up and running back down the hill to work his charms on a different female

The pictures were taken by photographer Andy Howard, 42, who lives near Inverness. He said: ‘Boxing hares are an early indication that spring is just around the corner.

'I was out looking for mountain hares in
the snow when I happened to spot this pair looking very alert and 
experience told me that their behaviour was a little bit different to 
normal.

'I sat and watched them for about 20 
minutes before the action began, the male hare (the Jack) began by 
running around the female (the Jill) in a tight circle before he made 
his move.'

'She was having none if it and proceeded
to repel his advances with a series of high leaps and what looked like 
kick boxing moves.'

Mr Howard said this happened twice before the male shot off down the slope to work his charms on another female who was sitting close by.

Sign: The mountain hares are still wearing their winter white coats - but their sparring shows spring is in the air

Unusual: Fights between hares usually involve two males battling for the chance to mate with a female

The male is the one on the left, rearing up and running in circles,' said Mr Howard, 'the female is the one on the right doing the ninja moves and dishing out the punishment. Love was in the air but not for him.'

The mountain hare differs from the more common brown hare by getting a white coat for the winter. They go through three changes during the
year, from October to January they change from brown with a greyish 
blue twinge to almost full white.

From February until May their coats 
become a mottled brown and white before reverting back to the full 
summer brown with a white tail. In 1906 Scottish Mountain Hares were given a separate subspecies of Lepus timidus scoticus.

Mr Howard said: 'Looking for white hares in snow is by no means an easy task. From my own experiences finding 
mountain hares, let alone photographing them does take research, a lot 
of time and bags of effort.'
