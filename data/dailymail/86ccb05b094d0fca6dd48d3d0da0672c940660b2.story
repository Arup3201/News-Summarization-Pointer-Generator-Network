A university lecturer has apologised to the parents of a 15-year-old girl who died after taking ecstasy tablets he'd left stashed in his home during an unsupervised party.

Isobel Jones-Reilly, known as Issy, took two or three pills at the party at a west 
London townhouse owned by university lecturer Brian Dodgeon on Easter Saturday in April 
2011.

A group of young partygoers found a secret drugs stash - including ecstasy, LSD and ketamine - hidden by the academic, who was a lecturer at the Institute of Education at the time, in a whisky container in a wardrobe cupboard in his bedroom.

Mr Dodgeon today broke down in tears as he apologised to the parents of Isobel for leaving the drugs in the house - claiming he didn't believe he was being irresponsible to have left the party unsupervised as there was a '0.1 per cent' chance of his illegal narcotics being found.

Tragedy: Isobel Reilly, 15, pictured left, died in April 2011 after taking ecstasy at an unsupervised party in the home of Brian Dodgeon, pictured right leaving the hearing, and Angela Hadjipateras

Cleared: Brian Dodgeon, pictured with partner Angela Hadjipateras, was given an eight month suspended sentence for drug possession after Isabel's death. The couple have been told they will not be charged with gross negligence or manslaughter

At an inquest into her death, he turned to Isobel's parents in the front row and said: 'I am so sorry about what happened.

'All I can say was at the time I didn't feel as though it was irresponsible to have left the party unsupervised.'

His voice cracked and he wiped away a
tear as he added: 'In retrospect, I very much regret I had drugs at all
and I made that decision.'

But Dodgeon refused to accept it was 
'blindingly obvious' he should not have left his house unsupervised to 
attend another party in Hastings with his partner Angela Hadjipateras that night.

He said: 'At the time, it didn't seem
likely that anybody would come into our bedroom and start 
systematically looking through the drawers.

'There was a 0.1 per cent chance of 
anyone finding those drugs, there is also a 0.1 per cent chance that 
someone might turn the cooker on and some kind of gas malfunction causes
a fire and people die.'

Death: The Kensington home of lecturer Brian Dodgeon where he kept drugs but insisted they would be 'virtually impossible' for the teenagers to find

Addressing Mr Dodgeon, Westminster Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox
said: 'Isn't it blindingly obvious 14 to 15-year-olds are very likely 
to take the opportunity to misbehave and to really push the boundaries, 
and you should not have left them unsupervised.'

Dodgeon said the teenagers usually 
invited to his home for parties did not appear to be big drinkers, and 
the idea they were look for his drug stash never occurred to him.

'I had never had the experience of our bedroom being used by anyone but Angela and myself', he said.

'At none of the other parties had 
anyone gone into our bedroom, even a party that was unsupervised until 
3am - it was a no go area.'

He added: 'I didn't think that people
would go through our drawers in our bedroom, I didn't think anyone 
would go into our bedroom at all.

'You would have to go through 15 drawers before exhausting all the convenient drawers to look through.'

The inquest has heard at previous 
parties at his home, a teenage girl had to be put to bed for being too 
drunk and there had been cannabis smoking.

But Mr Dodgeon said: 'There had never
been evidence of drug taking and never serious problems with people 
getting drunk and being sick, or having to be driven home.

'It seemed to me from parties that we had supervised, people would sneak in very small beers or cider.'

The lecturer said the teenagers 
appeared to be 'polite and studious', adding: 'At that time, I felt that
party was going to be safe.

'I felt it was important to occasionally demonstrate a degree of trust to that generation of kids, I felt it would show trust.

'I really did not think that people would search the bedroom.'

Untimely death: Flowers and candles were left in tribute to the schoolgirl near her home after she died from taking up to three ecstasy tablets

Mr Dodgeon previously admitted four counts of 
drugs possession when he appeared in court after Issy’s death and was 
sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years in December
2011.

The  lecturer
was today told at the hearing 
he would not be charged with gross negligence or manslaughter over the 
pills being 'readily accessible'.

Dr Wilcox said: 'It has been decided there are no further prosecutions that can be brought.'

Dodgeon's partner Angela Hadjipateras told the inquest she believed his drug stash was 'virtually impossible' for the 
partying teenagers to find.

Ms Hadjipateras admitted she knew her
partner of 27 years was a recreational drug user, but she did not want 
to know where they were hidden in the house.

She
told the inquest Dodgeon regularly smoked marijuana or hash cannabis, 
and was aware he had taken LSD and ecstasy in the past.

Dudgeon only confessed where his drug
stash was hidden, inside a whisky bottle in the bedroom closet, when 
they drove back from Hastings following Isobel's death.

'I knew he had hash and marijuana, 
and that that had, I can't remember dates, but I know I had asked him if
he had any ecstasy or other drugs', she said.

'If he had anything in his possession, he said I wouldn't have to worry about it, they would be very well concealed.'

Ms Hadjipateras said Dodgeon moved 
his whisky tin of drugs to different places round the house, often 
picking hiding places which were 'high up'.

She said she had 'deduced' he would 
have drugs in the house because she knew he used them, but added: 'I 
chose not to find out where it was.'

She told the inquest: 'On the way home from Hastings, he told me. He told me that there were drugs hidden in the top cupboard.

'It was in the early stages, before 
we knew what had happened, and he said it was virtually impossible it 
could have been drugs in the house that would have been the ones.

'He said we couldn't have any problems with any of the kids finding them.

'He told me he had them right at the back of the cupboard, they were in our bedroom in the top cupboard.

'He told me that there was LSD ecstasy, and that there was a very small amount of ketamine.'

Asked
by the coroner why she had not tried to find the drugs, Ms Hadjipateras
said: 'I believed that Brian is extremely responsible, and that if he 
told me they were extremely well hidden, I preferred not to know.'

Ms
Hadjipateras admitted 'eight or nine' teenage parties had been held at 
their home prior to Isobel's death, although this was the first to be 
unsupervised.

Hearing: An inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court in London heard that the schoolgirl would 'probably' have survived if she had received medical attention when she first started to feel unwell

She had 
been forced to help a drunk teenage girl at a previous party, and 
accepted it was 'not totally outrageous' that drug taking, drinking, and
underage sex could take place at a party.

'Isn't that why you would generally supervise the parties, because of the risk that something can go wrong?', asked Dr Wilcox.

'Surely
it is absolutely barn door obvious the risk of alcohol, cannabis, and 
teenage behaviour is more likely to go up if the party is unsupervised.'

Ms Hadjipateras said she had asked a neighbour to be 'on call' during the party in case of emergency.

She
added: 'When I weighed up whether it was wise or unwise to go and leave
the kids at the party, I heard the views of a number of people whose 
children are the same age, I came to the conclusion it was a manageable 
risk.'

Shortly after taking the drugs, Issy began hallucinating and frothing at the mouth, the hearing was told.

But her friends only called an ambulance when
she collapsed and started shaking - about an hour after she took the 
pills. 

When paramedics arrived at the house 
in leafy Kensington, west London, her temperature had soared to 41.7C - 
compared to the normal body temperature of 37C, Westminster Coroner's 
Court heard.

Issy was taken to St Mary's Hospital, but she died later that morning.

Professor Robin Braithwaite, a 
forensic toxicology expert based at King's College in London, said Issy 
could have survived if she had been taken to hospital before her 
temperature had risen so dangerously out of control after she took the 
drugs.

He said: 'That is a very high 
temperature. The start of irreversible death is something like 42C, a 
temperature of 41C is very high.

'It may have been possible that she 
would have survived had help been summoned earlier when her temperature 
was not quite so high and she was unwell.

'There are cases reported where hyperthermia can be treated.

'The earlier help is sought, before 
the temperature rose to those high levels, it may have been possible had
she been admitted to hospital that treatment could have been given to 
try and lower her temperature.'

He said even with a temperature of 40C or 41C it is 'possible' she could have survived.

The 15 year-old suffered from 
suspected hyperthermia, brought on by taking two to three ecstasy 
tablets which were of 'high' purity, the inquest heard.

Cause of death was given as ingestion of MDMA - the active ingredient in Ecstasy.

Two other teenagers, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, also took pills at the party and were taken to hospital.

The inquest continues.
