Robbie Keane created another slice of history with the Republic of Ireland as they strolled to a 7-0 victory over Gibraltar in their Euro 2016 qualifier in Dublin.

The Ireland captain’s first half hat-trick saw him go out in front as the leading all-time scorer in European qualifiers, overtaking Turkey’s Hakan Sukur and Denmark’s Jon Dahl Tomasson.

The goals, his 19th, 20th, and 21st, all came in the first 18 minutes. And just to keep the numbers game going, his total tally now stands at 65, making him the 14th highest scorer in international history.

James McClean helped himself to a brace while Gibraltar goalkeeper Jordan Perez found his own net with a comical own goal before Wes Hoolahan strolled into the box to slot in a seventh as if it was a five-a-side game.

As if Perez’s day wasn’t bad enough, it came to a premature end on the hour mark when his boss, Allen Bula, decided to replace him.

 He was given a standing ovation by the home support as he departed for substitute Jamie Robba, and it was understandable.

These Ireland fans know what it’s like to see their side hammered like this. Germany came to the Irish capital during the previous World Cup qualifying campaign and hit Ireland for six. 

The bad news for Gibraltar? The world champions are in Group D alongside them.

They have now conceded 14 goals in their opening two fixtures, Ireland matching Poland’s 7-0 victory last month, and it looks as if it will be a long year ahead.

It took Keane just six minutes to break the deadlock and ease any nerves of being frustrated by the visitors. Hoolahan had all the time in the world to turn and pick out his pass for Aiden McGeady on the right wing.

The Everton star then provided his captain with an easy finish from six yards. Ten minutes later and Hoolahan was once again the creator. This time his chest control and first time ball for Keane sent the 34-year-old bearing down on goal. The Dubliner is advancing in years but he remains deadly when given the chance.

He didn’t waste this one and calmly slid the ball down the side of Perez. The hat-trick was completed from the penalty spot after in the 18th minute and maybe if it was a few years earlier he would have thought about celebrating with a cartwheel. He knows better now. 

And Ireland showed their ruthlessness after the interval. Less than 30 seconds in and McClean tapped home from close range after Keane turned provider. The fifth had more than a hint of tragicomedy about it when Perez kicked into his own net after Scott Wiseman blocked Hoolahan’s initial effort on the line.

There was no let up from the home side and McClean and Hoolahan both helped themselves to boost the goal difference for Martin O’Neill’s side. It means, for now, they top Group D.
