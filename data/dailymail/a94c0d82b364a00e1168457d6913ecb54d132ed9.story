A former New York City transit cop shot and killed his wife in front of their two young children Saturday morning in their home, say police.

Kevin Canty, 43, was taken into custody about a mile from his Queens home, where earlier his 40-year-old wife, who has not been named, was shot in the upper body.

The couple's two young children, a girl aged four and a boy aged eight, were home at the time of the shooting.

According to CBS, a neighbor shopping at a nearby deli saw the two children run from the house, yelling, 'Daddy shot Mommy!'

'They came in screaming, crying saying their dad just shot their mom and there’s blood all over, please help,' local Heidi Gamble said.

First responders to the scene at 104th Street near 101st Avenue in Ozone Park found the woman with gunshot wounds to her torso. 

A neighbor told the New York Post he was in the bathroom when he heard the woman’s screams. 'I heard a woman yelling, saying "No, no, no!"' he said. 'It sounded like it was on TV.'

She was rushed to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in cardiac arrest and died a short time later.

Witnesses told CBS that Canty ran several blocks away and allegedly tried to steal a car. He was arrested at Pitkin Avenue.

Canty worked as a Manhattan transit cop before he retired last year with a disability.

He received praise on the NYPD Facebook page for his part in saving a man who had a heart attack at Union Square subway station in 2012.

A neighbor told the New York Post that Canty was 'scary and intimidating.'

'He doesn’t really talk to people too much. You have to talk to him first,' Daniel Ali, 30, said.

Another neighbor said she wasn't surprised by the violent turn of events.

'They were not a happy couple,' Joanne Bagley, 52, told the Post. 'They fight all the time on the block. I guess it was inevitable.'

The two children are now in protective custody.
