A British doctor shot dead  by the Taliban was part of a humanitarian mission that had helped 2,000 Afghans, an inquest heard yesterday.

Dr Karen Woo was executed alongside nine other aid workers after they tried to cross a mountain river in August last year.

The 36-year-old, who was due to get married a fortnight later, suffered  ‘catastrophic’ injuries from two gunshot wounds in the attack.

Killed: Karen Woo who specialised in maternal and neo-natal care was on her third visit to Afghanistan

Shortly before her death she had helped to save the life of a baby boy who was struggling to breathe.

Her team had been halfway through a 120-mile, three-week expedition in the northern Nuristan Province when they were ambushed.

It was one of the worst attacks on aid workers in the region for 30 years.

The inquest in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, heard that Dr Woo, who specialised in maternal and neo-natal care, was on her third visit to Afghanistan at the time.

Hertfordshire coroner Edward Thomas said ‘he had nothing but admiration’ for her incredible life and the work she did delivering medical supplies to a region where one child in five does not reach its first birthday.

He said: ‘The mission up to the point of the tragedy was a great success.

'I have been given a figure of them 
helping 2,000 people and the reports indicate that Karen had assisted a 
baby in being able to breathe again and saved its life.’

At the time of the killing the Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, accusing the International Assistance Mission – the group Dr Woo was working with – of preaching Christianity.

But Mr Thomas said that was untrue and that the doctor, who had given up a well-paid surgeon’s job with Bupa, was murdered simply because there were some people who were ‘not happy that they were there’.

He added: ‘They were killed in an area where they were helping and supporting the population.

‘Their reason for being there was 
humanitarian and all of them lost their lives trying to make the area 
medically better. I have no doubt that the people they helped were 
devastated.’

He also said that the FBI was still hunting for those responsible for the massacre of Dr Woo and the ‘fine people’ she was with, which included one German and six American medics.

After her death, Dr Woo’s family set up a charity to buy medical equipment in her memory.

Her fiancé, Paddy Smith, 37, a former Army captain, said: ‘Karen was trying to help those who couldn’t help themselves, with no access to basic needs, and that is what we are trying to do with the foundation.

Verdict: Coroner Edward Thomas said Karen and her colleagues were murdered because some people were 'not happy that they were there'

When she was out there I received a 
call about her bringing this baby back to life, everyone was amazed that
 a woman doctor could do this’.

After leaving school at 16, Dr Woo, 
from Stevenage in Hertforshire, first trained to be a dancer and was a 
wing walker in her 20s.

She then obtained a medical degree and worked in
 Australia, Trinidad and Tobago and Papua New Guinea.

The coroner recorded a verdict of unlawful killing.
