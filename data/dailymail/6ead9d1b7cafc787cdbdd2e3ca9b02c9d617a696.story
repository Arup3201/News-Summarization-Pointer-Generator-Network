Last month science illustrator Eleanor Lutz brought us stunning graphics showing how animals fly.

And now she’s at it again with amazing illustrations showing how different animals breathe.

The fascinating animations show the direction oxygen and carbon dioxide travel in different animals to supply their body with oxygen.

According to the Seattle-based designer the graphics contain ‘actual science’ in showing how animals breathe.

‘I picked three species that I thought were particularly awesome,’ Ms Lutz writes on her website.

‘The topic really lends itself to a short looped GIF so that was an added plus.’

In the animations she revealed that animals have three different ways of breathing.

The first example uses the example of human lungs to explain how all mammals breathe.

It shows that humans inhale by moving their diaphragm to.

This lowers the air pressure in their chest and pulls air into the lungs.

The process of breathing draws oxygen into the respiratory system through the mouth and nose.

Air sacs in birds allow air to flow in just one direction through their lungs, known as ‘unidirectional’.

This means that air coming through the lungs is mostly fresh and has a high oxygen content.

In mammals air flow is ‘bidirectional,’ which means it moves back and forth into and out of the lungs.

This means air in a mammal’s lungs is mixed with ‘old air’, which has less oxygen.

For this reason, birds are able to fly at a higher altitude than mammals as they can get more oxygen from the thin air.

Inhaled oxygen passes into the alveoli in the lungs and ultimately diffuses into our blood, which allows cells to produce energy.

For carbon dioxide the opposite process occurs, with it being pumped out by our lungs. 

In birds, the process of attaining oxygen is somewhat different, as illustrated in the graphic below showing a chicken as an example.

Rather than using a diaphragm, air is moved in and out using pressure changes in air sacs.

These air sacs are used to store and pump air through the stationary lungs.

Muscles in the chest changes the pressure in the sacs, allowing them to draw air in and out. 

But in birds, air only flows in one direction, so they take in oxygen even when exhaling.

In simple terms, birds basically breathe in and out at the same time, to make breathing during long flights require minimal effort. 

This structure also means they can breathe at much higher altitudes than humans.

The final animal Ms Lutz looks at is the grasshopper, which transports air around its using tracheal tubes.

Here the grasshopper is used as a representation of all insects. 

They do not have lungs, and instead pump their abdomens to change the volume of their air sacs.

However saying insets ‘breathe’ is a bit of a misnomer as without lungs oxygen is not transported around their circulatory system.

Instead, they use the tracheal system of tubes to move gas around their body.

When air reaches a small tube called the tracheole, the oxygen dissolves into the tracheole liquid.

Through diffusion it then enters cells, with carbon dioxide moving the other way.

Using muscle contractions, insects can then control their respiration to a limited degree.

Last month Ms Lutz created animations to show different flight techniques in animals.

Each is composed of 15 frames based on traced body positions of the animals from slow-motion videos.

Specific points on the wings were then marked at each of the 15 frames and connected using imaginary curves.

This creates the sweeping arcs of colour seen, which track the motion and direction of the wings as they move.

They reveal how different animals fly with a different profile, and also how wings cope with animals of different sizes.

Ms Lutz explains that she used a programme called Matlab to create the animations, based on previous work she performed with larvae.
