People smugglers are using Facebook pages to advertise their illegal services to migrants desperate to escape Africa and the Middle East in search of a better life across the Mediterranean.

Criminal gangs in North Africa have reportedly branched out into social media to make contact with refugees who are willing to pay thousands of pounds for a place on a boat.

Everything from routes, contact details and even risk assessments for would-be migrants can be found on Facebook pages offering a passage across the Mediterranean according to The Telegraph.

'There are Facebook pages that advertise the smugglers' services,' Ewa Moncure, a spokeswoman for Frontex, the European Union's border control agency, told the Telegraph.

'They are using all sorts of digital means, including social media, to expand their operations. They've become very well organised and they're very adaptable.'

After making contact with the smugglers through Facebook, a reporter was offered passage on a boat from Egypt to Italy at a cost of 30,000 Egyptian pounds (£3,000).

Smugglers have trafficked a record 150,000 refugees on boats to Italy so far this year, driven by the huge profits to be made in what has fast become a multi-million pound industry.

But thousands of migrants have died as a result of overcrowded and inadequate vessels, and many more have been rescued after their overloaded boats got into difficulties.

Last week, 17 migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean were found dead by the Italian navy, after suffering hypothermia and dehydration.

In a separate incident, another 29 people are feared to have drowned after their boat from Morocco was hit by strong waves  off the coast of Spain.

Italy launched the Mare Nostrum (Our Sea) operation last year after 366 would-be migrants drowned off the coast of Sicily. 

Italian ships and aircraft involved in the £7.5 million ($11.9 million) per month mission patrolled close to the Libyan coast, rescuing over 100,000 people who had paid smugglers to bring them to Europe.

But the costly operation proved unpopular, with critics arguing that patrolling so close to Libya encouraged migrants to take the risky trip out to sea.

Twenty-one European Union countries are now contributing to a smaller mission called Triton, overseen by border control agency Frontex, which will patrol 30 nautical miles from Italy's coast.

The mission saw a group of more than 580 people, most of them from Syria, rescued from Congolese cargo 'Sandy' on Tuesday in an operation carried out by the Guardia Costiera.

According to the Telegraph, European officials say smugglers use maritime tracking websites to identify the location of military and civilian ships in the Mediterranean, banking on the vessels rescuing the boats full of hundreds of migrants.

Jose Maria Duenas, the commander of the Rio Mino,  told the newspaper that migrants are typically traumatized when they are  rescued.

But he said that with conflict and poverty across the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa - along with the breakdown of law and order in Libya which allows the criminal gangs to thrive - the trade in transporting humans shows no sign of slowing.

'The politicians need to find a deal with Libya to solve this problem,' he added. 'But Libya right now is in chaos, so the boats will keep coming, and we'll be here to rescue them.'
