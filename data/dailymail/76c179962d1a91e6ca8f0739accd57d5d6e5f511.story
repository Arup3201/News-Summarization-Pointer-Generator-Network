Fireman will stage eight days of rush hour strikes as part of its long-running dispute over pensions.

The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) today announced that members would walk out during peak hours as part of a string of stoppages later this month.

Fire Minister Brandon Lewis condemned the move, saying that firemen were already being offered 'one of the most generous pension schemes in the whole public sector'.

Mr Lewis said: ‘The Fire Brigades Union keeps disrupting a taxpayer funded service with more unnecessary industrial action.

‘The proposals put forward protect the earned rights of a higher proportion of members than any other public sector scheme. Nearly three quarters will see no change in their pension age in 2015.

‘Under the new scheme, a firefighter who earns £29,000 will still be able to retire after a full career aged 60, get a £19,000 a year pension, rising to £26,000 with the state pension.

‘The equivalent private pension pot would be worth over half a million pounds and require firefighters to contribute twice as much.’

All firefighters in the union across England and Wales will refuse to work between 6am and 8am and 5pm and 7pm from Monday 14 July until Thursday 17 July.

They will then walk out in seven further two-hour strikes from Friday 18 July until Monday 21 July.

The FBU claimed that current proposals on pensions and later retirement age were ‘unacceptable, unworkable and unrealistic’.

It has been in negotiations with the Government for three years in an attempt to avoid the implementation of proposals that they say would see firemen paying more, working longer and receiving less.

Matt Wrack, FBU general secretary, said: ‘The Government must realise that firefighters cannot accept proposals that would have such devastating consequences for their futures, their families' futures - and the future of the fire and rescue service itself.

‘We have tried every route available to us to make the Government see sense over their attacks.

‘Three years of negotiations have come to nothing because the Government is simply unwilling to compromise or even listen to reason despite a huge amount of evidence showing their planned scheme is unworkable.

‘Shorter strike periods have illustrated the strength of feeling amongst firefighters whilst limiting disruption to the fire service, the public and our members' working lives.

‘But the Government is merely ploughing ahead, forcing firefighters to react.’

FBU members in Wales and England will join the huge strike by over a million public sector workers next Thursday.

The firemen have taken strike action over the past year but the dispute remains deadlocked.

In December a retired father-of-two Richard Nicholson died in a blaze in a flat in north London during a walkout by fire crews.

A neighbour raised the alarm at 9.52pm but striking firemen remained on their picket line until the four-hour walkout ended at 10pm. When they arrived at his ground-floor flat they found his body.
