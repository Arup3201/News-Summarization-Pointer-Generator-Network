A British couple have been living in a garage for four-and-a-half years after their house in southern Spain was demolished over 'planning irregularities'.

Len and Helen Prior, both 68, are now launching a landmark legal case to get compensation after their luxury villa became the first home owned by Britons to be bulldozed - despite having the correct planning permission from the Spanish authorities.

The retired expats have been living in the garage on the plot of their demolished home since 2008, when the villa was destroyed.

The couple claim the construction of their home - in Vera on Spain's southern Costa Almeria - was above board and was given the green light by the local town hall.

However, their licence was revoked by the regional government of Andalusia who claimed there were 'planning irregularities' and ordered its destruction.

It is unclear precisely what these irregularities were, but - a year after their home was destroyed - the Priors won a small victory when Spain's Constitutional Court ruled demolition was illegal, the Telegraph reported.

Their only option now is to sue the Spanish judiciary - but it could mean the couple spend the rest of their twilight years battling it out in the courts.

Mrs Prior told The Telegraph: 'It's our last hope but we've been warned it would be a ground 
breaking case. The Spanish authorities hope that we will 
give up and just go home.

'But this is our home. We have 
nowhere else to go to. I do wonder how many years I have left to live 
and it's so upsetting to think that they will probably be spent fighting
on. But we won't give up. We can't.'

The Priors say they have been advised that, because the demolition order was signed by a judge, legal action should be taken against the judiciary system itself.

According to the ruling by the Constitutional Court, Spanish law was broken when the destruction order was signed, not only because the authorities had failed to inform the Priors of the decision but also as an appeal was pending on their case.

The couple are now awaiting a court date after travelling to Madrid to file their case against the Judiciary.

However, they have been warned the legal process could take years and, even if they win, the Spanish authorities might not even be able to pay.

The country is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy as the economic crisis worsens.

The Priors were among the earliest 
victims of a series of illegal building scandals in Spain which arose 
after a development boom - fuelled mainly by British buyers - in the 
1990s swamped stretches of the Mediterranean coast with apartments and 
villas.

During the frenzied years of 
building, many local town halls apparently turned a blind eye to 
planning regulations or even took bribes to grant building licences to 
thousands of homes that were constructed on protected land.

However, crackdowns by regional and 
national governments led to the arrest of dozens of planning officials, 
and thousands of homes were under threat of demolition.

Len and Helen Prior sold their 
family home in Wokingham, Berkshire, and built a Â£350,000 retirement villa in the 
seaside town of Vera in Almeria nine years ago.

The luxury villa was built to their 
own design specifications and was affectionately given the name of 
'Tranquilidad' to reflect the couple's hopes of how they would spent 
their retirement.

From the start they did everything by
the book, employing a reputable lawyer and obtaining a building licence
from Vera town hall before the property was built.

What they didn't know was that behind
the scenes, the regional government in Seville had already warned town 
hall planners that the development should not go ahead because it 
entailed urbanisation of 'rustic' land.

In January 2008, their home was 
demolished in front of them after a dramatic stand-off during which Mr 
Prior, who has a heart condition, collapsed and was taken to hospital.

After clearing the rubble, the Priors -
bit-by-bit - converted the garage and workshop once adjoining the villa
into a cramped dwelling and an old caravan has been turned into a 
makeshift bathroom while a shed has become a lavatory.

There is no mains electricity source, so power comes from a small generator and they use a neighbour's water pipe.

Mr Prior said in a previous interview: 'We're pensioners and we shouldn't have to live like this.

'We
couldn't have done more to ensure our home was legal. What's happened 
makes me extremely angry and it's the anger that keeps me going. If it 
wasn't for the anger, I think I'd collapse.'

In fighting the case, the couple's 
legal bills in their compensation fight - as well as a new licence to 
rebuild their home - has grown to 150,000 euros.

Mr Prior told The Telegraph: 'I can honestly say that that 
they [Andalusia government] have wrecked our lives. They have taken 
everything we worked for away from us, 45 years of working hard and now 
we have nothing.'
