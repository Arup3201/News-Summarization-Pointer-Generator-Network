Tens of thousands of patients are dying needlessly in hospital every year from kidney failure linked to dehydration, NHS officials have revealed.

They calculate that up to 42,000 deaths a year would be avoided if staff ensured patients had enough to drink and carried out simple tests.

NICE, the NHS watchdog, is today issuing guidelines to staff to help them prevent deaths from the condition – known as acute kidney injury – which is common in the  elderly and patients with heart disease,  diabetes and blood infections.

Tracy Holmes said she had to smuggle ice lollies in to hospital after nurses left her mother Sandra Aston so thirsty her lips cracked and bled

Mrs Aston was admitted to Redditch Alexandra Hospital in April last year suffering with inoperable lung cancer and secondary liver cancer

It is estimated that a fifth of all patients attending A&E every year – one million people – suffer from the illness, of whom an estimated 210,000 die.

Tens of thousands of these deaths are due to dehydration and are avoidable with better care, with one kidney expert accusing doctors and nurses of ‘taking their eye off the ball’.

The latest estimate is far higher than any previous figure. In 2009, a Care Quality Commission report said the number dying in hospitals because of dehydration was just 900 a year.

The family of Sandra Aston, 79, have told how they smuggled ice lollies in to Redditch Alexandra Hospital after nurses left her so thirsty her lips cracked and bled.

Mrs Aston was ‘treated like an animal’ by nurses, who claimed they could not help when her family begged them to act as she became increasingly dehydrated.

While she was too weak to drink from a cup, her thirst could have been quenched with oral sponges. But staff did not provide these, leaving her family to feed her ice lollies they bought outside.

As they finally received a formal apology from the hospital, Mrs Aston’s family yesterday spoke of their ongoing distress about the way she was left to die with so little dignity.

Her daughter Tracy Holmes, 51, who lived close to her mother and father Robert, 80, in Evesham, Worcestershire, said medical staff deprived her dying mother of ‘basic human dignity’ in her final days. ‘My mother was left dehydrated, with no monitoring of her fluid or food intake,’ she added.

‘We constantly found her freezing cold, with cracked bleeding lips and in considerable distress due to her discomfort and desperate thirst. We even took to bringing her ice lollies because the hospital was unable to provide oral sponges. We fear that if we had not been there then Mum would have received nothing at all.’

She said the care received by her mother was ‘appalling’ and ‘no better than that given to a helpless animal’.

After three days of persistent complaints, nurses finally began using wet sponges on Mrs Aston’s lips.

The trust’s chief nursing officer Helen Blanchard has written to Mrs Holmes, offering a ‘heartfelt and sincere’ apology. She added: ‘We have taken action to improve care.’

The new guidelines come amid growing concern about the standard of NHS care, with several damning reports highlighting appalling neglect in some hospitals.

NICE says the condition cannot be blamed on poor nursing, because it often develops before patients are admitted to hospital, but experts say NHS staff are not doing enough to detect the illness and prevent it from getting worse.

Professor Donal O’Donoghue, a former national director of Kidney Care who works at Salford Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester, said: ‘It’s the vulnerable, frail elderly who are affected.

‘They don’t get adequate fluids – they don’t feel like drinking, so they don’t request them.

‘The doctors and nurses think about the fall, the pneumonia or whatever else is affecting them and take their eye off the ball in terms of the kidneys.

‘By the time it’s noticed, it’s often very late in the day and too late.’

Acute kidney injury describes the sudden shut-down of the kidneys. If detected early enough, the condition can be treated by giving patients extra fluids or putting them on a dialysis machine.

The condition can also be caused by NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) painkillers and ACE inhibitor drugs, and doctors are urged to stop prescribing these immediately if patients are affected.

It is rarely recorded on death certificates, because doctors don’t realise patients are suffering from it.

Dr Mark Thomas, a kidney specialist at the Heart of England NHS trust in Birmingham who helped draw up the guidelines, said acute kidney injury killed more people than any of the common cancers.

He added: ‘In the past, the care for this condition has not always been uniformly good, partly because the patients have tended to present to a range of non-specialists who may have been unfamiliar with the best prevention and treatment of the condition.

‘Many hospitals and healthcare professionals have been doing an excellent job in watching out for acute kidney injury in their patients, but unfortunately this good practice is not seen everywhere. Not only can we save lives with this guideline but the money we save could be put back into general NHS care.’

The guidelines tell doctors and staff to carry out simple checks to detect the condition in patients over 65, particularly those with dementia or other conditions whereby they are dependent on someone else to give them water.

Other high-risk groups include those with heart failure, liver disease, diabetes or blood infections.

Doctors and nurses are urged to carry 
out simple urine tests to measure the levels of the chemical serum 
creatine, which are high if patients have kidney failure.

Staff are also told to ensure patients have enough fluids and to check whether patients are dehydrated by looking for signs such as dry skin and sunken eyes.

Dr Peter Carter, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘This guidance should help doctors and nurses to spot those patients who are at risk and be confident in monitoring and treating them.

‘This is an area of medicine where many lives could be saved if the level of understanding is the same among staff in all settings, and the NHS as a whole should act on this guidance as a matter of urgency.’

The guidance makes no mention of the Liverpool Care Pathway whereby fluid, food and other drugs are withdrawn from patients who are believed to be close to death.

But as the condition is primarily caused by dehydration, it could affect some patients on the pathway.
