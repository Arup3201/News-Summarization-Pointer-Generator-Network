Casey Kasem's wife and one of his daughters have reached a settlement that ends a bid to place the ailing radio personality in a conservatorship.

Details of the agreement between Kasem's wife, Jean, and his daughter Julie Kasem were not divulged in a Los Angeles court where the settlement was announced today.

Julie Kasem had been seeking a conservatorship and has said she and her siblings have been blocked from seeing their father, who is suffering from advanced Parkinson's disease.

Her attorney Andrew Katzenstein says the terms of the settlement are confidential.

Another of Kasem's daughters, Kerri, has not reached an agreement.

Her attorney Troy Martin says she may have to file a petition to see her 81-year-old father without certain restrictions.

Martin says Casey Kasem is currently hospitalized but wouldn't provide more details.

A Los Angeles judge last month has rejected a bid by Casey Kasem's daughter to establish a conservatorship.

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lesley Green however urged lawyers to reach an agreement that would allow three of Kasem's adult children to visit their father.

Jean Kasem has hit back at her husband's children from his first marriage and claims she and Casey, pictured here in 2007, have been helping to fund their lifestyles for many years

Jean Kasem's representative announced on October 19 that Casey will die in the next few months

The
 81-year-old gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, American 
Top 40 and Casey's Top 40, and was also the voice of Shaggy in the 
cartoon Scooby Doo.

His
 children Kerri, Julie and Mike Kasem staged a very public protest 
outside their father’s home in October to publicize their concerns for 
his well-being and to accuse their step-mother Jean Kasem, 59, of 
blocking them from seeing their father.

Julie
 Kasem then filed a petition for a temporary conservatorship, to have 
someone placed in charge of the legendary radio host's affairs who would
 give regular updates to a judge.

She and her siblings said the legal action wasn't about money – as they've already been cut out of his will - and is purely about concern for his well-being.

But that story was contradicted by legal documents filed by their stepmom who insists she is taking great care of her ailing husband and continues to give him manicures and pedicures, reports TMZ.

The legal documents also reveal that she and Casey have loaned his children approximately $100,000-$150,000 per year for many years to pay for their school, housing, cars, parking tickets, travel, etc. 

She also cited an example of a $50,000 loan that she claims was given to Julie back in 2000 and which has never been repaid.

Lawyers for Jean Kasem also argued that if there is a need for a conservator, it should be his wife. 

In October, court-appointed Attorney Samuel Ingham told Judge Roy Paul that he had visited Kasem and did not see an immediate need for a conservatorship, although he did admit that he still lacked information about Kasem's doctors and treatments.

Kasem, who lives with his wife of 33 years, Jean, and their adult daughter, was checked out by police detectives and social services workers, said Marshall Grossman, an attorney for Mrs Kasem.

Grossman urged Paul to reject Julie Kasem's petition, saying the effort was detrimental to his client and the radio host.

A
 2007 document that appointed Julie Kasem as an overseer of her father's
 medical care had been superseded by 2011 estate planning documents, 
said Grossman, who filed the records in court in October.

Grossman called the new documents 
‘bulletproof’ and in a court filing wrote that the radio host's 
intention was to receive medical care in his home.

In a sworn declaration, Jean Kasem wrote that the actions of her step-children, including press conferences, accusations she is holding her husband hostage, and the filing of the conservatorship case, have been a ‘living nightmare.’

She wrote that her husband was bedridden and receives around-the-clock care from medical professionals.

‘It is my sincere hope that Casey's physical surroundings coupled with the attentiveness of the medical providers and the love of his own home and wife and child are comforting to him,’ Jean Kasem wrote.

Paul refused to dismiss the case, noting that Ingham had requested additional information about medical care. The judge noted, however, that it did not appear that any court intervention was necessary to ensure Kasem was receiving proper care.

In October Kasem's children and other friends staged a very public protest outside his home to publicize their concerns for his well-being and to accuse their step-mother Jean Kasem, 59, of blocking them from seeing him
