Martin Johnson has offered to help NFL teams with their tackling.

Rugby has been used by Super Bowl-winning coach Pete Carroll to 'take the head out of the game' and its influence could be further felt.

Johnson, the fearsome World Cup-winning captain and former England coach, says former rugby professionals could assist the college game and the NFL.

'It depends if it becomes the vogue but I can see a glut of former rugby players offering themselves up as tackling gurus to the NFL and college game. I think in the world we live in now, every team will want to be seen to do the right thing and I think the NFL teams will consider getting rugby guys in,' he told Britviewnfl.com.

The NFL faces a class action lawsuit from former players over hiding the effects of concussion.

Chris Borland, a highly-rated 49ers linebacker, was so concerned the safety of the game that he announced his retirement aged 24.

'I would always offer my knowledge to NFL teams if they want to talk to me about tackling. I’m not saying I’m any sort of guru but I would be willing to talk to them if any of the NFL teams were interested. It’s very real from now on with that Borland news, if it wasn’t already.'

Johnson also spoke of Seattle Seahawks' adoption of rugby techniques to make his team tackle better - and safer.

'I think it is very rare for American sport to look outside of American sport so for them to look at another sport and for Pete Carroll to show videos of rugby, that makes you say, ‘Oh, OK, that’s interesting.’ I’ve seen the Seattle guys training without helmets at times and that’s great because then you really do have to think about your head and your technique, because you have to get that technique right.'
