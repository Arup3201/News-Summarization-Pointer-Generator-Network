Having thrown away a three-goal lead against Anderlecht on Tuesday night, Arsenal could do with a lesson in how to 'park the bus'.

For three star players however, the chance did arise to learn how to park something a little smaller.

Midfielders Aaron Ramsey and Santi Cazorla were joined by England striker Danny Welbeck to take on a parking challenge, as part of a new advert for Citroen.

The three players seemed to be having a great time as the tried out the Citroen C1 and Citroen C4 Cactus.

With a cardboad cut-out of Arsene Wenger directing them, and driving instructors guiding them on the way, the three players drove the cars around an airfield in Hertfordshire.

Despite Arsenal's shocking collapse on Tuesday the three players, all of whom started against Anderlecht, looked in good spirits, laughing and joking throughout the challenge.
