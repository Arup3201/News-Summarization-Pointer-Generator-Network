Foreign Corrupt Practices Act bans U.S.-based corporations from paying bribes to overseas officials

Violation would be a first for any media company

FBI investigating whether Murdoch journalists hacked into phones of 9/11 victims and their families

Robert Murdoch's News Corp is facing a global investigation into whether News of the World employees paid out bribes to British police for information.

The U.S. Justice Department has confirmed a preliminary investigation is underway into the extent of the ongoing phone hacking scandal that has engulfed News Corp, which is headquartered in New York.

A violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act - which bans U.S. companies from paying bribes to overseas officials - would be a first for any media company.

9/11 claims: Media mogul Rupert Murdoch, 80, was speaking with his son James during questioning by a Parliament Select Committee in London

The DoJ is working with the U.K.'s Serious Fraud Office to determine how to investigate the allegations in the U.S.

Before launching a formal 
investigation, officials seek to determine how much money was allegedly 
paid out for bribes by the corporation and if it was part of a 
widespread pattern of conspiracy, reports ABC News.

A spokesman for the Justice Department had declined to issue public comment at press time.

Prosecution under the FCPA can result in steep penalties.

‘We have seen no evidence of that at 
all and as far as we know the FBI haven't either. I cannot believe that it happened to anyone in America'

On July 13, Florida-based Armor 
Holdings admitted to funnelling bribes to a United Nations official to 
secure contracts to supply body armour to UN peacekeepers; the company 
paid more than $15million in penalties, reports The National.

In 2008, Siemens paid out $1.6billion after pleading guilty tor two violations.

A preliminary investigation by 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation is currently underway into whether 
News of the World employees hacked the phones of 9/11 victims and their 
families.

Rupert Murdoch said today he will
 'absolutely' launch a full investigation if any revelations of 
phone-hacking of 9/11 victims came to light.

The media mogul, 80, was speaking with his son James during questioning by a Parliament Select Committee in London today.

But Mr Murdoch said he has seen 
'no evidence' of this and does not believe the FBI, which is already 
investigating, has found anything either.

The Murdochs were also asked 
about actor Jude Law alleging that his phone was hacked in the U.S. and 
pressed again on 9/11 phone-hacking.

But James Murdoch insisted again they have 'no evidence of that'.

Concerned relatives of 9/11 
victims are asking the FBI to brief them on its probe into allegations 
that journalists hacked into their phones.

The FBI is looking into claims 
that News of the World journalists bribed New York police officers for 
phone records of 9/11 victims’ families.

'We have seen no evidence of that
 at all and as far as we know the FBI haven't either,' Rupert Murdoch 
told the committee during a hearing.

'I cannot believe that it happened to anyone in America.'

Sally Regenhard, whose 
firefighter son Christian was killed on 9/11, has been inundated with 
phone calls from concerned family members of victims.

Ms Regenhard said earlier this 
week there is a lot of confusion and the families want an update on what
 investigators know so far.

U.S. authorities have 
acknowledged they are looking into a report by Britain's Daily Mirror 
newspaper, which cited an unidentified source.

The report has yet to be 
independently verified but already has fuelled U.S. emotions over the 
wider phone hacking scandal that has consumed Britain.

It has also rocked Rupert Murdoch's News Corp media empire, which is frantically trying to regain credibility.
