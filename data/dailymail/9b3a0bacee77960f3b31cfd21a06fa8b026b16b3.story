A rural section of train line was plunged into chaos after high winds derailed two huge freight trains - by blowing one into the other.

The accident during a storm near Waynoka, Oklahoma, delayed around 60 trains on an intercontinental track and prompted a full-scale cleanup operation.

But investigators had to be cautious - as one of the cars reportedly contained fireworks.

Oklahoma! Where the wind comes sweeping up the trains: The intercontinental BNSF line was plunged into chaos after high winds derailed two huge freight trains  by blowing one into the other

Scale: Workers had to remove the huge trains yesterday as the backlog reached a reported 60 services

The trains - each a mile long - crashed just after 11pm during a fierce storm on Sunday night. Residents had been warned winds could reach 70mph.

According to FOX 25, one of the carriages contained fireworks which it was feared could have been made unstable after the two trains toppled.

Storm chaser Shane Helton, 40, told MailOnline the BNSF Railway Company had issued orders for both trains to slow down just 12 minutes before the accident happened.

'BNSF issued a high wind warning to slow down,' he said. 'The trains were slowing down and the derailment happened at 11.14pm'.

When the sun rose, the scene was one of containers toppled over, some of them ripped open with their contents spread across the railway. But despite the chaos, no one was injured.

Disruption: As the cross-continental backlog increased, engineers worked furiously to remove the trains

As the cross-continental backlog increased, engineers worked furiously to remove the trains and, incredibly, managed to reopen the line in time for this morning.

It is thought the crash may have been caused by straight-line winds, a phenomenon created when a thunderstorm creates a downburst of air, forcing out strong blasts in all directions.

Mr Helton, who works on an oil field, added: 'I see a lot of things but it's been about 10 years since I saw a derailment like this.

'The trains are over a mile long so you're looking at probably at least 100 containers per train'

- Storm chaser Shane Helton, 40

'We get between 60 and 80 trains a day and when you get a severe thunderstorm like we did on Sunday these things can happen.

'The trains are over a mile long so you're looking at probably at least 100 containers per train.

'They were unbelievably fast at cleaning it up. They laid track panels like you do on a model railway, several other firms were called to help and the trains were running past my house this morning.'

The incident came just a day after another BNSF train carrying a hazardous liquid derailed at a yard in Tulsa, around 200 miles away.

The railway yard was evacuated while the leak of xylene, which is highly flammable, was dealt with.

The high winds on the Great Plains which sweep through Oklahoma are even immortalised in one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's most famous musicals.

The title song of Oklahoma! declares it as the land 'where the wind comes sweeping down the plain', a badge worn proudly by some locals.

But the area has also had more than its share of train wrecks.

A train more than 40 containers long spilt its load of beer all over the railway in August last year - in the exact same spot as Sunday night's incident.

And in 2008, a train carrying crude oil and ethanol sent fireballs into the sky when it derailed in Oklahoma City. No one was injured.
