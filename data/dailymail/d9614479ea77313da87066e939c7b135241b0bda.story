For years, millions of women have woken up on Mothering Sunday to be presented with a bouquet by their children, with the stems tied precariously in a bag of water.

But no longer will they risk an untimely splash, as Marks & Spencer becomes the first High Street retailer to deliver flowers in a water-free, airtight container.

Some 160,000 blooms ordered to celebrate the event today will arrive in the new packaging.

Look, no water! Liquid-free flowers for Mothering Sunday have been introduced by Marks & Spencer

The move is expected to save 50,000 litres of water this weekend, and almost 500,000 litres over the year.

The change is thanks to Modified Atmosphere Packaging, a method similar to vacuum-packing, which keeps flowers fresher for longer.

This method removes oxygen, so carbon dioxide levels rise, slowing the respiration of the blooms and ‘putting them to sleep’ in transit. But when unpacked, cut and put in water, the buds ‘wake up’.

The new packaging not only saves water, it reduces carbon footprint.

Such bouquets take up less space and M&S says it will need 19 fewer lorries to deliver Mother’s Day flowers this year.

The packaging is to be extended to all flowers sold in its stores as part of the company’s plan to become the world’s greenest retailer by 2015.
