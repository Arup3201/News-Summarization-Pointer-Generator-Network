Rebels supporting Moscow yesterday threatened to set up a separatist 'state' called 'New Russia' in eastern Ukraine as they called on women to take up arms in their militias.  

The controversial move suggests to critics they are following a script dictated by Vladimir Putin who, in turn, is eyeing land originally won for Russia by Catherine the Great more than two centuries ago.

Separatists are plotting to announce the merger of Ukrainian regions Donetsk and Lugansk into a new 'country' which they hope will swallow other southern parts of the ex-Soviet republic, it was revealed yesterday.

Rebel 'governor' of Donetsk, Paval Gubarev, said: 'Unification is highly likely, and this will be the basis of the "Novorossiya’ (New Russia) state.'

Another leading official Denis Pushilin said negotiations were underway between Donetsk and Lugansk to recreate on the map the ‘Novorossiya’ name that was once given to these territories after their incorporation in Imperial Russia by Catherine the Great in the 18th century. 

The pro-Moscow “defence minister” of the breakaway Donetsk region, Igor Strelkov, yesterday appealed on the web for more people to take up arms in support of independence from Ukraine.

'If men are not willing, then we have no other option than to call up women and take them into the militias,' he said.

Pushilin added: 'We need strong men to protect our republic because civil war is raging in our region.'Many men are falling every day, so we need more.' 

The original 'New Russia' was set up after Catherine’s conquests 220 years ago, a vast swathe of Ukrainian territory from Kharkiv in the north-east to Odessa in the south-west as well as Transitria - now a breakaway part of Moldova - in the west.

Putin in a televised question and answer session last month implied there was an injustice in this territory being outside Russia.

'Novorossiya - Kharkov, Lugansk, Donetsk, Odessa were not part of Ukraine in Tsarist times,' he said.

'They were transferred in 1920 [after the Bolshevik Revolution]. Why? God knows.'

If Putin did annex these Ukrainian provinces, it would leave a rump Ukraine without any coastline on the Black Sea.  

The calls came amid that next Sunday’s (25 May) scheduled Ukrainian presidential election will be reduced to farce.

Election chiefs admit they will not be able to conduct the poll in eastern regions controlled by pro-Russian militias which means it will not be a nationwide poll.
