Your pizza delivery man could soon be out of a job.

A Russian drone company has developed airborne robots which can carry up to 5kg of weight and fly up to 40km per hour, making them perfect for delivering takeaway meals.

CopterExpress has been working with drones, multicopters specifically, for two years, explains a spokesman, in a new video from the company.

'We are the worlds first company who organised this and are now developing a commercial service of small goods delivery by air with the help of robots,' he continues. 

The devices also have inbuilt GPS systems and cameras, so their journeys can be tracked.   

The company have already worked with one fast food chain.

Dodo Pizza, in Syktyvkar, north Russia, claimed to be the first pizzeria to offer delivery by drone. 

In June, they posted a video online showing the first airdrops of pizzas to customers, promising that this was the future of take away deliveries.  

'We already sold six pizzas in one and a half hours using a drone, it is a real business model,' manager Ilya Farafonov told AFP.

The fast food chain promised to get deliveries out within 30 minutes and if it cannot complete an order within an hour, the customer will not be charged. 

Its plan is to expand delivery by drone to 18 other Russian cities, with a menu featuring a range of flavours priced from £6 (325 Russian rubles).

Meanwhile, Domino's posted a video featuring a DomiCopter, a pizza-delivering multicopter drone online in June, and in New York, a Brooklyn pizzeria owner made a test delivery flight by drone back in the same month.

'We are embracing new technology,' said Charles Walters, the CEO of Williamsburg Pizza. 'Our prediction is that within the next five years, food will be flying 300 feet in the air.'

'By 2018, I predict we'll have a fleet of at least 25 drones to deliver pizza,' the entrepreneur told the New York Post.
