Young Britons have turned into ‘Generation Pause’ and now routinely delay life events such as marriage and having children due to financial worries, a study found.

One in five 25 to 34-year-olds had or would be postponing their wedding for more than two years, the report said, while one in ten said they could never afford to marry.

Meanwhile one in seven 35 to 44-year-olds had or would put off starting a family for at least five years, and a quarter had done so for two years because of a lack of savings and investments.

One in 12 envisaged never being able to afford children, and a quarter of this age group believe they will never afford a house.

The report, released by investment company SCM Direct, said it showed the extent to which ‘financial constraints are directly impacting on matters of the heart’. 

It added: ‘We believe the impact of this delay is seismic, not just on a personal level for those who have hit the pause button, but on a wider level.

‘What would be the societal and economic impact if the age that couples started families shifted to the late 30s and mid-40s, with couples in Generation Pause increasingly postponing having children?

‘What will be the impact on the housing market if we move to a nation of renters rather than buyers, or to a model in which people can’t afford to get their first foot on the ladder until middle age?’

More than 3,000 people aged 18 to 85 were asked if they had or would be delaying different life events – including marriage, having children, buying a house and retirement – because of money woes. 

And Research Plus, which conducted the survey, found a significant number of those aged 25 to 54 had done so – dubbing them ‘Generation Pause’.

Nearly half of this age group admitted they would have to delay their original retirement plans due to a lack of savings.

A third admitted they were relying on family inheritance to fund their future, while the same number believed they would have to downsize at some point to raise more money for life events.

Gina Miller, of SCM Direct, said: ‘We are reaching a crossroad. Life ambitions that were once taken to be a given – marriage, children, buying a property or retiring – are no longer seen as achievable by a significant portion because feelings of financial security and stability are at an all-time low. 

'We believe that the UK is heading for a crisis. Britain – one of the most wealthy countries in the world – now has a generation of 25 to 54-year-olds in which only one in six is confident that what they are currently saving will be enough to cover their future plans.’

She added: ‘We have been shocked by how prevalent the “pause effect” is and how severely it is impacting people’s lives.’

The study also found that half of women had less than £1,000 in savings, compared to less than a third of the male population. And just one in five women have savings of more than £20,000, against over a third of men.

However their problems could be partly due to spending habits. Those in Generation Pause admitted spending four times as much on holidays and three times as much on fashion and personal grooming as they did investing in pensions and savings.
