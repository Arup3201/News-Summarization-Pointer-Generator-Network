A millionaire businessman known as 'The Bitcoin Jesus' turned the tables on a hacker who was attempting to blackmail him by offering $20,000 worth of the digital currency as a reward for his capture.

U.S. born Roger Ver has amassed a small fortune in Bitcoins after investing heavily from 2011 and using the currency, which has since exploded in value, to back a number of start-up firms.

But last week he received a threatening message from a hacker known as Nitrous who had taken control of an old Hotmail account using it to steal personal information including Mr Ver's social security and passport numbers.

Bitcoin Jesus: U.S businessman Roger Ver turned the tables on a hacker who had broken into one of his old email accounts and was trying to blackmail him

Nitrous then threatened to sell the information to fraudsters unless Mr Ver paid him 37 bitcoins - worth a cool $20,000, Wired magazine reports.

Although Mr Ver is believed to be easily be able to afford such a sum, he refused to pay up and instead used Facebook to offer the same amount as a reward for information that would lead to Nitrous's arrest.

While Bitcoin is often trumpeted as simply being a libertarian currency and way to move money across international boundaries it is heavily linked to the sinister online marketplace SilkRoad where drugs, guns and even hitmen are offered for sale.

Soon after the bounty was placed on Facebook a clearly terrifed Nitrous backed down contacting Mr Ver with a cowering apology.

He wrote: 'Sir, I am sincerely sorry. I am just a middleman. I was being told what to tell you.

'Are you going to order a hitman to kill me now?'

Response: Mr Ver posted this message on Facebook after which the hacker quickly backed down

It
 was a far cry from the blackmailer's original messages in which he 
brazenly threatened to exploit Mr Ver after seizing control of the old 
email account which Mr Ver had used several years ago to register the internet domain 
memorydealers.com for his computer parts business.

After
 taking over the account Nitrous was not only able to access Mr Ver's 
personal information but also that of his mother which he threatened to 
sell to 'fraudsters' who would 'ruin both of your lives'.

'I think we
 both know this won’t be pleasent [sic] and let’s be honest: there is 
nothing you can do to have me caught. I’ve been around too long,' 
Nitrous wrote, before adding: 'I have to say: I respect you as a BTC 
user/icon.

'Let's
 be honest I will sell your information to fraudsters that will credit 
f*** you then get your moms social and credit f*** her too and ruin both
 your lives.'

'37.6 BTC isn't worth s*** to you, the damage I cause to you financially/family-wise will be way worse than that.'

Mr
 Ver, who is now based in Japan, decided to stall for time, attempting 
to negotiate with Nitous, while he and close associate Jason Maurice, chief hacking officer of Japanese security startup Wiz 
Technologies, attempted to wrestle back control of the hacked accounts.

After an hour-long exchange through Skype, Nitous attempted to up the ante, threatening to 'own' Ver 10,0000 times harder.

Demand: Nitrous was asking for 37 Bitcoins - worth $20,000 - from Mr Ver after hacking into his email account

'You Fag,' he wrote. 'Listen, my mom needs a liver transplant that starts at $15,000, man…I am so sorry for having to do this, but it’s just what I have to do.'

But Ver cooly responded by posting a link to the Facebook post offering the reward and Nitrous quickly backed down.

He then wrote: 'Sir, I am sincerely sorry I am just a middleman I was being told what to tell you.

'I was seriously being told what to tell you by someone else I don't even know what's going on.

'Please stop I am so sorry I told him that you are now going to have me killed over something he made me do I didn't even do this it was someone else.'

Mr Ver said he has not been contacted by the hacker since.

What is a bitcoin?

Bitcoins are basically just lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next.

They are the basic unit of a new online economy which runs independently of any company, bank, or government.

Because bitcoins allow people to trade money without a third party getting involved, they have become popular with libertarians as well as technophiles, speculators — and criminals.

Who's behind the currency?

It's a mystery. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and then adopted by a small clutch of enthusiasts.Nakamoto dropped off the map as Bitcoin began to attract widespread attention, but proponents say that doesn't matter; the currency obeys its own, internal logic.

What's a bitcoin worth?

Like any other currency, bitcoins are only worth as much as you and your counterpart want them to be. In its early days, boosters swapped bitcoins back and forth for minor favors or just as a game. One website even gave them away for free. As the market matured, the value of each bitcoin grew.

Is the currency widely used?

That's debatable. Businesses ranging from blogging platform Wordpress to retailer Overstock have jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon amid a flurry of media coverage, but it's not clear whether the currency has really taken off.

On the one hand, leading bitcoin payment processor BitPay works with more than 20,000 businesses — roughly five times more than it did last year.

On the other, the total number of bitcoin transactions has stayed roughly constant at between 60,000 and 70,000 per day over the same period, according to bitcoin wallet site blockchain.info.

Is Bitcoin particularly vulnerable to counterfeiting?

The Bitcoin network works by harnessing individuals' greed for the collective good.

A network of tech-savvy users called miners keep the system honest by pouring their computing power into a blockchain, a global running tally of every bitcoin transaction.

The blockchain prevents rogues from spending the same bitcoin twice, and the miners are rewarded for their efforts by being gifted with the occasional bitcoin.

As long as miners keep the blockchain secure, counterfeiting shouldn't be an issue.
