Victims of the Black Saturday bushfires have been handed a record $500 million payout.

About 5,000 residents from the East Kilmore and Kinglake area - in Victoria's north - who took part in the class action will share in $494.7 million.  

Victoria's Black Saturday bushfires broke out in 2009 and were the worst natural disaster in Australia's history.

The survivors sued electricity provider SP AusNet, Utility Services Corporation Limited and the Department of Sustainability and Environment after 119 lives were lost in the fires on February 7, 2009.

The class action was settled in July without admission of liability and approved by Victoria Supreme Court Justice Robert Osborn on Tuesday.

Justice Osborn said the legal battle could have resulted in no outcome for group members.

The settlement was reached after a trial that was fiercely contested for 16 months, and he said the settlement was a legally and commercially significant sum.

Justice Osborn said in addition to the lives lost in the blaze, more than 1,000 people were injured, and 1,172 homes and properties were destroyed.

There were only two relevant objections received from more than 5,000 group members, he said.

Justice Osborn ordered that the legal costs of $60 million be paid by group members.

Lead plaintiff Carol Matthews, who lost her son Sam in the fires, addressed media after the payout was approved.

The 22-year-old died after their St Andrews home was engulfed in flames from the Kilmore East blaze.

His parents were away on vacation at the time and he remained in the home because he thought the fire would not make it to their property, The Age reported.

'We finally get to ease the financial struggle that so many people are facing on a day-to-day basis, and for that I am really thankful,' Ms Matthews said after the ruling was delivered

An emotional Ms Matthews said the agreement sent a warning to other companies to make sure nothing like the Black Saturday bushfires happened again.

She said she was both relieved and comforted by the outcome, which help victims get their lives back on track.

'We finally get to ease the financial struggle that so many people are facing on a day-to-day basis, and for that I am really thankful,' Ms Matthews said, according to the Herald Sun.

Every day of the court hearing she wore a symbol of her love for her son - a five-cent coin with the word 'to infinity and beyond' on it as well as the infinity symbol.

She said it gave her strength during the difficult times.

'I've held on to it knowing that at some stage he would help us to get some justice for all those people that died,' Ms Matthews said.

'It isn't just about Sam, it’s about the other 119 people that died on that day.'

Ms Matthews was on the phone with her son when the fire reached their home, the court heard when it was her turn to give evidence during the trial.

'Suddenly he went "Oh my god, the tree's on fire ... oh my god it's just exploded", then within seconds his whole tone of voice changed into a voice of panic and said "Oh god there's fire everywhere",' she said.
