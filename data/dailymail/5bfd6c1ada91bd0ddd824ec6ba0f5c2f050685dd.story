An audio recording offering further evidence Fox News host Bill O'Reilly lied in his book Killing Kennedy has been aired by CNN.

In his book, O'Reilly claimed he heard the blast when George de Mohrenschildt - an associate of President John F. Kennedy's assassin Lee Harvey Oswald - killed himself with a shotgun in Florida.

CNN's Reliable Sources played an audio recording from 1977 where a young O'Reilly is heard talking about traveling to Florida to cover de Mohrenschildt's suicide.

An audio recording released by CNN proves Bill O'Reilly (above) lied in his best-selling book Killing Kennedy 

The Fox host claimed in Killing Kennedy, (right) that in 1977 he 'heard' the fatal shotgun blast in the suicide of George de Mohrenschildt (left) who gave testimony at the investigation into President Kennedy's death

O'Reilly, 65, was covering the JFK assassination for Dallas, Texas, television station WFAA at the time. 

In his book, O'Reilly wrote: 'In March of 1977 a young reporter knocked on the door of de Mohrenschildt's daughter's home.

'He heard the shotgun blast that marked the suicide of the Russian.

'That reporter's name is Bill O'Reilly.'

The recording, which was originally published by former Washington Post reporter and author Jefferson Morely on his website JFKFacts.org in 2013, seems to prove that claim is false.

In the high-quality recording CNN aired on Sunday, O'Reilly can be heard calling investigator Gaeton Fonzi to confirm de Mohrenschildt's suicide.

He also talks about coming to Florida, meaning there is no way he could have been on de Mohrenschildt's doorstep to hear the shotgun blast. 

In the tape, O'Reilly said: 'I'm coming down there tomorrow.

'I'm coming to Florida.

'I'm gonna try to get a night flight out of here, if I can.

'But I might have to go tomorrow morning.' 

Fox released figures showing O'Reilly's weekly audience  is up 11 per cent compared with  last year

Morley told Media Matters Reilly's claim about overhearing the gunshot in de Mohrenschildt's suicide is 'just not true'.

He added: 'It is what these guys all do, they inject themselves into a dramatic situation. 

'O'Reilly was chasing this story, but he wasn't there, he made it sound like he was more on the scene than he was, it was show business.'

Former WFAA reporter Tracy Rowlett echoed those sentiments. 

He said: 'Bill O'Reilly's a phony, there's no other way to put it.

'He was not up on the porch when he heard the gunshots, he was in Dallas. 

'He wasn't traveling at that time.'

Fox News did not comment about the matter and referred Daily Mail Online to book publisher Henry Holt & Co.

Henry Holt spokesperson Patricia Eisemann said: 'We fully stand behind Bill O’Reilly and his bestseller Killing Kennedy and we’re very proud to count him as one of our most important authors.

'This one passage is immaterial to the story being told by this terrific book and we have no plans to look into this matter.'

A Fox News spokesperson previously told Daily Mail Online: 'Bill O'Reilly has already addressed several claims leveled against him.

'This is nothing more than an orchestrated campaign by far left advocates Mother Jones and Media Matters.

'Responding to the unproven accusation du jour has become an exercise in futility. 

FOX News maintains its staunch support of O'Reilly, who is no stranger to calculated onslaughts.'

On Friday, Fox News released figures showing O'Reilly's weekly audience grew by 11 per cent compared with the same period last year, the Washington Post reported.
