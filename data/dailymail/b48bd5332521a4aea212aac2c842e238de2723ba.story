Leg of lamb: Tasty, and it could be good for your face

Forget expensive face creams and Botox. If you want younger-looking skin, try rustling up a soup from the leftovers of your Sunday roast.

Broth made from the bones of a beef joint or leg of lamb is being hailed as an anti-ageing treatment by experts,  with claims it can firm the face.

Julia March, a beauty therapist to Hollywood celebrities, recommends it to clients complaining of sagging skin or redness.

She said: ‘My clients see less inflammation, more glow and more toned skin when they drink it. It repairs, strengthens, rejuvenates and heals.’

She recommends drinking up to three cups of broth a day to improve the complexion.

The broth is made by simmering bones in water with a dash of vinegar, which is said to help draw out minerals, for several hours. Vegetables and herbs can be added to improve the taste.

Advocates claim it can improve the complexion because of its high levels of natural collagen, the protein that gives skin its strength and flexibility.

This is coupled with hyaluronic acid, a molecule found in bone cartilage which draws water and essential minerals to cells.

Jaclyn Flavell, author of ebook Bone Broth: A Recipe For Health, said: ‘It stands that a sufficient amount of healthy collagen under the skin in the subcutaneous fat will keep skin strong and smooth, resulting in less wrinkles and cellulite.

‘Hyaluronic acid, a water-loving molecule, most likely contributes to healthy-looking skin by retaining moisture.

‘Consuming bone broth which is rich in collagen and cartilage if prepared properly, is an easy and inexpensive way to maintain strong, smooth and supple skin.’

Nutritionist Ian Marber, founder of The Food Doctor brand, said: ‘It can help plump up the skin. It can also help digestion and as it’s rich in magnesium, can help combat stress and relax muscles too. It’s good stuff.’

Mr Marber recommends making bone broth using grass-fed beef for the greatest benefit, and advises breaking up the bones to expose the marrow before heating.

However, Ayela Sprio, a nutrition scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation, said no scientific trials have been carried out to prove the benefits of bone broth – and advised against drinking too much.

She said: ‘A recent paper suggested some concern in increasing bone broth consumption considerably.

‘The authors reported there may be a high lead concentration in such broths as bones are known to hold on to lead.

‘The majority of national and international skin associations would recommend a balanced healthy diet to ensure all the nutrients important for skin health are consumed.’
