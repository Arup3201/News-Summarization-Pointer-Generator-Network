NETBALL BRONZE IS SNATCHED AWAY

After losing their netball semi-final in the dying seconds a day earlier, England missed out on bronze to the Jamaicans thanks to another poor final quarter.

Elsewhere, Australia beat New Zealand 58-40 to claim gold and goal shooter Caitlin Bassett did not seem too concerned about her country finishing a distant second in the medal table.

‘There’s no pressure on us to return to the top of the Commonwealth table,’ the  26-year-old said.

Usain Bolt, who thrilled the crowd with his lengthy post-relay walkabout on Saturday night was not in attendance at the closing ceremony yesterday.

The 27-year-old Jamaican sprinter had already left Glasgow  by the time the ceremony began, due to commitments before his next race - the most notable of which being a special 100metres race at Rio de Janeiro’s Copacabana beach in 10 days’ time.
