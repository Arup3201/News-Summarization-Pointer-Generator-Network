Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt said the search giant has developed breakthrough technology that will allow illegal videos to be 'tagged'

Last week 348 people were arrested in
 Canada – and 386 young kids rescued – in one of the largest child sex 
investigations ever seen. It defies belief that anyone would sexually 
abuse children, especially teachers and doctors entrusted with their 
care.

But this awful case highlights the depths to which humanity can sink.

And
 while society will never wholly eliminate such depravity, we should do 
everything in our power to protect children from harm.

That's
 why internet companies like Google and Microsoft have been working with
 law enforcement for years to stop paedophiles sharing illegal pictures
 on the web.

We 
actively remove child sexual abuse imagery from our services and 
immediately report abuse to the authorities. This evidence is regularly 
used to prosecute and convict criminals.

But as David Cameron said in a speech this summer, there's always more that can be done. We've
 listened, and in the last three months put more than 200 people to work
 developing new, state-of-the-art technology to tackle the problem.

Cleaning up search: We've fine tuned Google Search to prevent links to child sexual abuse material from appearing in our results.

While
 no algorithm is perfect – and Google cannot prevent paedophiles adding 
new images to the web – these changes have cleaned up the results for 
over 100,000 queries that might be related to the sexual abuse of kids.

As important, we will soon roll out these changes in more than 150 languages, so the impact will be truly global.

Deterrence:
 We're now showing warnings – from both Google and charities – at the 
top of our search results for more than 13,000 queries. These alerts 
make clear that child sexual abuse is illegal and offer advice on where 
to get help.

Detection and removal: There's no quick technical fix when it comes to detecting child sexual abuse imagery.

This
 is because computers can't reliably distinguish between innocent 
pictures of kids at bathtime and genuine abuse. So we always need to 
have a person review the images.

Once that is done – and we know the pictures are illegal – each image is given a unique digital fingerprint.

U-turn: Internet search results linked to child abuse are to be blocked across the world by Google

This
 enables our computers to identify those pictures whenever they appear 
on our systems. And Microsoft deserves a lot of credit for developing 
and sharing its picture detection technology.

But
 paedophiles are increasingly filming their crimes. So our engineers at 
YouTube have created a new technology to identify these videos.

We're
 already testing it at Google, and in the new year we hope to make it 
available to other internet companies and child safety organisations.

Technical expertise:
 There are many organisations working to fight the sexual exploitation 
of kids online – and we want to ensure they have the best technical 
support.

So Google 
plans to second computer engineers to both the Internet Watch Foundation
 (IWF) here in Britain and the US National Center for Missing and 
Exploited Children (NCMEC). We also plan to fund internships for other 
engineers at these organisations.

This
 will help the IWF and NCMEC stay one step ahead. The sexual abuse of 
children is a global challenge, and success depends on everyone working 
together – law enforcement, internet companies and charities.

We
 welcome the lead taken by the British Government, and hope that the 
technologies developed (and shared) by our industry will make a real 
difference in the fight against this terrible crime.
