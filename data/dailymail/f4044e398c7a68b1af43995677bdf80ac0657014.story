For the fourth year in succession Cristiano Ronaldo has made the final three-man shortlist for UEFA's Best Player in Europe Award and this time he is accompanied by Arjen Robben and Manuel Neuer.

Real Madrid forward Ronaldo will hope to claim this award for the first time, having been nominated every single year since its inception in 2011 but having failed to win it on each occasion.

The Ballon D'Or winner enjoyed a stellar season, winning the Copa del Rey as well as Madrid's 10th European Cup - La Decima.
