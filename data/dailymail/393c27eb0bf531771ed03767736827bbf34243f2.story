Joey Barton has come out on top in his latest Twitter war with Piers Morgan - by correctly predicting that Germany would beat Brazil in their World Cup semi-final.

The QPR midfielder had a £5,000 bet with the broadcaster which he duly won after Germany humiliated Brazil 7-1 in Belo Horizonte, with Morgan having backed the hosts to triumph.

Barton expected Germany to win 2-0 while Morgan went for the Selecao to triumph.

Winner: QPR midfielder Joey Barton correctly predicted that Germany would beat Brazil

Out of pocket: Morgan will have to pay £5,000 to charity after losing his bet to Barton

And the 31-year-old was keen to rub it in, tweeting Morgan: 'I've never seen anything like this. Sitting here like... #tearsforpiers @piersmorgan #5k #Freemoney.'

Morgan himself was also self-deprecating, saying: 'I think #MysticMorgan needs to go on holiday.'

Barton asked for the money to be split evenly between the Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool and the Official Hillsbrough Justice Campaign.

The bet was just the latest in a long list of high profile Twitter battles the pair have had.

Most infamously, they argued over Twitter before they both appeared on panel for BBC Question Time in May.

On that occasion, Barton tweeted Morgan a picture of the book British Politics for Dummies.

Morgan replied: 'I don't need to train for intelligent political debates. You however... well, best of luck.'

He then called Barton a dog, saying: 'I've appeared on @bbcquestiontime 17 times, but not for 4 years, and never with a Pitbull. Should be amusing....'

Battles: Barton and Morgan have sparred on Twitter before, most notably before they were on Question Time

Controversial: Morgan referred to Barton as a 'pitbull' when they argued before Question Time
