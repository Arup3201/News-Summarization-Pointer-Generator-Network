Frank Lampard is flourishing at Manchester City — but it would be a great deal harder for Chelsea to swallow were they not six points clear at the top of the Barclays Premier League.

Attitudes may change, however, if this goal trend goes on, if his loan is extended and if the title rivals are neck-and-neck by the time City visit Stamford Bridge at the end of next month.

No-one at Chelsea thought when he departed in June to embark on a career in the MLS that Lampard would appear on loan at the Etihad Stadium. Even if they had, there was nothing they could have done.

His contract was up and manager Jose Mourinho wanted Cesc Fabregas. Lampard was told through negotiations that his playing time would be greatly reduced and that the time might be right for a new challenge if he wanted to play regularly.

There was no formal contract offer and Lampard described the split as ‘very mutual’, although it is hard to escape a lingering feeling that he would have preferred to stay.

Having reached that point, Chelsea had no right to dictate where he went, so they wished him well as he selected New York City from his many options, although it was unclear how links between this new MLS franchise and City, its parent club, would work.

By the time they were preparing to face him in City colours in September, it was clear the mood at Chelsea had already started to shift.

‘I was not expecting this,’ said Mourinho. ‘But it was his decision. It’s his life. When he left for New York, I thought he was going there. But it is his life, his decision and he has my respect for that.’ As Arsene Wenger noted, the easiest way from London to Manchester is not via New York. Wenger sniffed a Financial Fair Play dodge, which City denied. Mourinho, too, seemed increasingly irritated.

‘When he decided to become a direct competitor of Chelsea then love stories are over,’ said Mourinho after Lampard’s equaliser against Chelsea.

The open offer from Roman Abramovich for Lampard to return in some capacity in the future is apparently still there — but the longer this goes on and the more successful he is at City, the more it will feel akin to the ambush of Patrick Vieira from Arsenal’s history.

Mourinho was irked when Chelsea supporters sang Lampard’s name, although those chants have since faded. Why support a direct rival?

Lampard’s enduring ability to influence any game in which he features, however briefly, prompts more questions about why he was allowed to leave.

Mourinho values experience in the dressing room. He re-signed Didier Drogba to be a positive influence and to use tactically, mostly from the bench. Lampard has started four games for his new club, two in the Premier League. He has come on seven times as a substitute and scored five.

Drogba has started four games, made 12 appearances from the bench and has scored four. Mourinho required cover up front and a mentor for Diego Costa, so it has proved a successful move.

In midfield, it was slightly different since Fabregas has formed an excellent partnership with Nemanja Matic.

Fabregas and Lampard never got on as opponents, so who knows how that would have panned out? There is also a theory that to enable the younger players to thrive, they had to dilute the old dressing-room power base.

Ashley Cole and Lampard went. Petr Cech could be next. For Chelsea fans, all of this will be easier to take if they hold off City and win the title.
