A leading surgeon sacked after exposing poor care had written to the head of the NHS to warn patients were dying needlessly. 

Raj Mattu is the third whistleblower known to have raised his concerns with Sir David Nicholson. But no action was taken despite his hospital having the highest rate of avoidable deaths in the UK.

Sir David is already under pressure to quit having presided over the Stafford hospital scandal in which up to 1,200 people are thought to have died through negligence.

And he was head of the health authority responsible for Dr Mattu’s hospital when the renowned heart specialist warned him of ‘poor safety and excess death rates’.

Dr Mattu also told him staff at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust were scared to speak out and those who did were victimised.

The surgeon said Sir David, who is chief executive of the NHS, had ignored his warnings and should go. 

‘After I raised serious concerns about patient safety and deaths I increasingly suffered victimisation, harassment and discrimination,’ he added.

‘I cannot foresee clinical staff being prepared to come forward or speak out on behalf of patients or the public when they see my obvious persecution. I know of clinicians at UHCW and the West Midlands NHS who have declined to come forward in fear of repercussion, and of avoidable deaths that continue at UHCW.’

Dr Mattu has fought a decade-long battle to clear his name which is believed to be the NHS’s longest-running and most expensive whistleblower dispute.

He claims he was ousted after being suspended from his job in 2002 when he complained that overcrowded wards had caused the deaths of at least two patients.

He claims a patient he was trying to resuscitate died when nurses could not reach him with lifesaving equipment because the bay was overcrowded.

Dr Mattu also raised a Public Interest Disclosure request about the money-saving management policy of placing five beds in bays designed for four patients.

He said that following his whistleblowing, he was suspended and paid £560,000 to do nothing for five years before being sacked in 2010. He is contesting his sacking.

Last night, Dr Mattu said: ‘There’s a lot said about protecting whistleblowers, but the reality is there is no genuine desire by those in charge to protect them. A lot of senior managers do not seem to be able to distinguish between what is good for patients and what is good for the reputation of the NHS and for their jobs. 

‘The culture comes right from the top. Sir David Nicholson’s position is untenable.’ 

A spokesman for NHS West Midlands denied that a copy of the letter from Dr Mattu’s letter of 2006 had been received by the then strategic health authority.

He added: ‘All hospitals undertook a number of actions to make improvements including doing a clinical audit of cases and setting up a clinical group to regularly look at data.’

When Dr Mattu was suspended the Warwickshire trust had a zero-star rating because of its poor performance.

Gary Walker, the former boss of United Lincolnshire Hospitals, has also warned of a ‘culture of fear’ which deterred whistleblowers from coming forward. The trust’s ex-chairman has spoken out as well.
