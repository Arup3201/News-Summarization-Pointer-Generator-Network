A couple ended up in jail after they were spotted having a late-night tryst on top of a car at a used car dealership, police said.

Erin Bird, 18, and Ramon Mitchell, 29, were charged with lewd and lascivious behaviour after they were caught in flagrante delicto at Mike’s Auto Sales in West Palm Beach, Florida.

Police said a witness called them just before midnight on Monday to report a naked couple enjoying each other's company on top of a 2004 white Kia Sedona parked inside the dealership.

'Officers made contact with the complainant who advised he just witnessed both subjects having sex on top of the vehicle in plain sight,' a police incident report said.

The caller told officers he could hear the pair moaning, and that he was upset and offended by what he had seen, the Sun-Sentinel reported.

By the time police arrived they found Byrd and Mitchell inside a white van, putting their clothes back on. The van also belonged to the dealership, police said.

Officers arrested the pair, but as they put the handcuffs on Mitchell he spat in the face of one, who was then forced to go to St Mary's Medical Centre for 'bio-hazard exposure', according to wsbradio.com.

Bird and Mitchell were charged with lewd and lascivious behaviour, auto burglary and trespass after the incident at Mike’s Auto Sales, pictured. Mitchell was also charged with aggravated assault on a police officer

Michael Melendez, owner of Mikes Auto Sales, told police the pair had no permission to be on his property, according to the police report.

As well as the charge of lewd and lascivious behaviour, Byrd and Mitchell were each charged with auto burglary and trespass. Mitchell also faces a further charge of aggravated assault for spitting at an officer.

Byrd was released from jail the following day, while Mitchell is being held on $11,000 bail.
