Sam and Dawn Ray loved their house by the river. The only problem was that when the Severn got too high they invariably ended up marooned in it.

Rather than move, however, the couple came up with a perfect – if expensive – solution to the problem and spent £100,000 having the £140,000 home raised 12ft off the ground to create what amounts to a bungalow on stilts.

They decided to take action after their bungalow stood 4ft 6ins under water in 2007 - and cashed in part of their pensions to fund the project.

After builders carefully raised the bungalow, in Sandhurst, Glos., the couple saw their forward planning pay off in last week's heavy floods.

Retired greyhound trainer Mr Ray, 75, watched as heavy rain and winds lashed at his home last week - with flood water lapping 2ft above the ground.

But thanks to the stilts, the pair could shelter in a dry home.

The area where the kitchen and conservatory once stood still remains under 1ft of water.

Mr Ray, who has nicknamed their home the 'bunga-high' instead of bungalow, said they were delighted with the results of the work.

Overhaul: Mr and Mrs Ray's house during its renovation in October 2009 - after water from the River Severn repeatedly gushed into their home and made it uninhabitable

Temporary: The wooden outhouse where the couple lived while they waited for the work to be done

He said: 'We just couldn't face being flooded again, but we can sleep at night now.

'The planners weren't keen at first but our MP Laurence Robertson was very helpful to us when we needed to get planning permission.'

The couple cashed in some of their savings and used insurance money to pay for the £100,000 work, which started in 2009.

Their home was left uninhabitable following the 2007 floods and could not be sold easily.

Mr Ray said the work was costly but has turned the couple's lives around as they now have a house they can live in and sell in the future.

Tall order: The house required extensive building work in order to elevate it 12ft off the ground

Flood: Sam and Dawn Ray's home in 2000 during the height of a flood which made their home uninhabitable

Their house insurance has also dropped from a four-figure sum with a £15,000 excess to less than Mr Ray pays for his car insurance.

He said his only regret was that the builder who implemented his plans, Mark Saysell, 55, died in August before he saw the scheme working.

'He did a great job and I wish he could have seen it work,' he added.

Water levels in Sandhurst are dropping but remain at 3ft deep in places - with councils attending more than 600 calls for assistance from flood victims in the last 10 days.

Relieved: The couple watched from their new balcony as the flood water lashed
