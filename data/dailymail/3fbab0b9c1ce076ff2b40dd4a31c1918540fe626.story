Apple reported last week that the iPhone 6 sold a record-breaking four million units in the first 24 hours of presales, and earlier today said ten million models of their latest phone were sold over the first three days it was available to the public, making it the most popular iPhone yet.

The bad news however, is despite all its advancements, and its very high cost, which starts at $199 then goes up to $399 for the iPhone 6 plus, the device still cracks when it lands on its screen.

A recent demonstration tested every iPhone ever made to see how they would fare if dropped on their side and their screen, and only one phone managed to survive the impact with its screen not shattered.

Smash test dummies: A new test set out to determine which iPhone has the best screen by dropping every model ever made on its side and its face

Bad news: The iPhone 2 (left) and the iPhone 3 (right) both shattered when they were dropped on their face

Winner: The iPhone 4 (right) got ruined too, but the iPhone 3GS (left) proved to be the best, with the screen not cracking at all when the phone was dropepd

That phone was not an iPhone 6 or an iPhone 5 or even an iPhone 4, but rather the iPhone 3GS, introduced on June 8, 2009, over five years ago.

Unfortunately, Apple stopped producing the iPhone 3GS in September 2012. 

The video tests every single phone starting with the iPhone 2G and goes all the way up to the iPhone 6 plus, and the one positive is that the touchscreens continue to work on every model, it's just that seeing anything on the screen becomes a bit more difficult.

Check out how each phone does in this test in the video above.
