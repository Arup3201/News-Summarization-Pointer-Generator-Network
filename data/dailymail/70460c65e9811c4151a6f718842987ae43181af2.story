AC/DC guitarist Malcolm Young is unlikely to return to the band, according to the rock group's biographer.

Malcolm, 61, has already been temporarily replaced by his nephew, Stevie, while he battles a mystery illness that saw him hospitalised last month 

Speaking to a US radio station, biographer Jesse Fink has warned fans to expect that 57-year-old Stevie is now part of the band and will tour as a part of AC/DC later in the year instead of Young.

‘I’m not expecting to see Malcolm return,’ Fink said.

‘I think the important thing is that we let Mal be and hope he can recover. But I think we should all expect that Stevie Young is in the band now.’

Stevie played on the band’s latest album, their 15th record, which is expected to be released later this year. The band reunited in Vancouver, Canada in May this year to record their new music.

Stevie first filled in for his uncle in 1988 whilst Malcolm received help for his issues with alcohol.

Frontman Brian Johnson confirmed that Malcolm is in hospital last month in an interview with Classic Rock Magazine.

Johnson also revealed the huge impact Malcolm’s absence is having on the band. They are considering calling the album Man Down.

‘It’s a bit negative and it was probably just straight from the heart. I like that,’ Johnson explained.

This year marks the 40th anniversary of the band's formation. It's rumoured they will celebrate with a 40-show tour across 40 cities - but Stevie Young will tour the band in place of his uncle, Malcolm Young.

Fink has just released a new AC/DC biography, entitled The Youngs: The Brother Who Built AC/DC.

This year marks the 40th anniversary of the band and there has been speculation the band will perform 40 shows in 40 cities as a part of celebrations.
