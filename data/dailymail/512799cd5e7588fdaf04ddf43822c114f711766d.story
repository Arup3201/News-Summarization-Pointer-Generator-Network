It's not the sort of smash and grab most people expect at a bank.

Firefighters were forced to shatter the front of a crowded financial institution in China after a five-year-old boy got his fingers trapped in its glass door.

Dozens of people gathered and one filmed the drama as the boy screamed and cried, before being carried away by his distraught mother.

Smash and grab: Firefighters had to shatter a glass bank frontage to free a boy aged five in eastern China

Distraught: The boy was protected with a heavy fireman's jacket as the glass was smashed, leaving him unhurt

CCTV captured the moment on Saturday when the boy got his fingers stuck.

Another child was swinging the heavy door back and forth when the unnamed child put his hand in its hinges.

A crowd of adults gathered within seconds around the boy as he cried in pain, but despite their efforts they were unable to free him.

With a guard around the door to make sure no one opened it, a crowd quickly gathered as firefighters arrived on the scene in Anhui Province, eastern China.

Unable to free the boy, the rescuers sheltered him with a heavy firefighter's jacket and used a pickaxe to smash the glass.

Fortunately he suffered no serious injury apart from three swollen fingers.

It came as a curious woman had to be rescued by firemen in China after she became stuck between two giant rocks - because she wanted to try and sneak through the tiny gap.

In a less extreme version of the scenario which inspired the film 127 Hours, the woman became wedged between the boulders in the popular tourist city of Mudanjiang, northeast China.

The film was based on the ordeal of real-life canyoneer Aron Ralston, whose arm became trapped in a crevice in Blue John Canyon, Utah, in April 2003.
