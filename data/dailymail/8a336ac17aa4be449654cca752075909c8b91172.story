'Star': Colleagues at her media firm have paid tribute to Erena Louise Wilson from New Zealand who died on Sunday afternoon after being hit by a tree branch

Friends of an account manager killed by a falling tree branch in Kew Gardens have remembered the 31-year-old as 'beautiful inside and out'.

Erena Louise Wilson, from Hanwell, west London, died walking in the Royal Botanical Gardens in South West London on Sunday afternoon.

Her two friends said there was a 'loud crack 
like thunder' and they looked up and saw a 12 inch thick branch from a 60ft 
tall Lebanese cedar coming crashing down.

The
pair ran for their lives but when they looked back were horrified to 
see Miss Wilson lying face down on the ground surrounded by branches.

Onlookers and paramedics were unable to 
save her because she died instantly from 'non-survivable 
head injuries', West London Coroner’s Court heard.

Marcus Allan, 42, a friend of Miss Wilson's from when she worked at a pub near Dumfries, before moving to London, said she was loved by everyone and described her as a 'one-off'.

He told the Evening Standard: 'I have never met anyone like her. She was stunning, beautiful inside and out.'

Colleagues at media firm Deluxe Digital Studios in Southall where she worked have also paid tribute to their colleague, originally from New Zealand.

Speaking
outside the inquest, human resources manager Gez Lowry said: 'It is 
difficult to put into words how we all feel following the tragic passing
of our colleague and friend Erena Wilson.

'Whilst
it’s hard to draw any comfort or understanding at this time, Erena’s 
colleagues are trying to focus on the good times they shared with her on
a day to day basis.

'To us Erena was a star.'

Police have contacted Miss Wilson’s mother, who lives in Auckland, New Zealand and her father in Australia. A maternal uncle who lives in the UK is helping to organise the repatriation of her body to New Zealand.

In a statement, family spokesman Alan Hunt said: 'We are very saddened by the death of our beloved Erena Louise Wilson, who was fatally struck by a falling tree branch at Kew Gardens, London, on the weekend.

'The family wish to express their sincere thanks to the emergency services in England, whom we are told did a remarkable job with their attendance to the scene and their attempts to revive Erena.

'Our thanks to the police and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and NZ High Commission, both in New Zealand and England, for their promptness at getting in touch with and keeping her mother informed and arranging for victim support services, who were with her immediately.

'Please respect our wishes for privacy at this time, while we come to terms with our loss and as we make arrangements for Erena to be returned home.'

She added: 'As account manager to one of our major film clients Erena quickly settled in, becoming popular with her work colleagues and respected by the client she looked after.

'Erena enjoyed working in the media industry and would have gone on to bigger and brighter things, which makes her passing all the sadder.

'She was happy in her work, had great potential and a long career ahead of her.

'On behalf of everyone at Deluxe, I would like to pass on our deepest condolences to Erena’s family and friends at this very sad time.'

A post-mortem examination found the cause of Miss Wilson’s death to be multiple injuries.

The tragic incident, which took place as gusts of up to 30mph swept the capital, is being investigated by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).

The tree was next to a footpath that leads to the Orangery restaurant in the botanic gardens.

Metropolitan Police inspector Simon Young was the first officer on the scene on Sunday afternoon.

Paramedics were trying in vain to resuscitate her and she was pronounced dead at 2.51pm.

He told the inquest how statements were taken from Miss Wilson’s friends Tessa and Sean Britton.

He said: 'They stated they were walking along a path and heard a loud crack believing it was thunder or something similar to that.

'They looked up and saw the tree branch descending. They then ran and then looked back around and the lady was on the floor in an uncomfortable position, to say the least.

'There were lots of branches all around her.'

No mention was made at the inquest of whether the gales in the area at the time played a part in the accident.

Witness Gary Baker, 51, had previously told how he heard what sounded like 'shotgun fire' as the branch fell.

He said: 'I looked and could see what remained of the branch. I didn’t see it hit the woman but it was quite clear she was badly hurt.

'The branch was extremely large. It was 12 inches thick at least. It was near her but not on top of her. She looked in a bad way. She was lying face down. There was blood coming out of her mouth and I couldn’t find a pulse.

'I got her in the recovery position and another man started giving her CPR. The ambulance control centre was giving us instructions over the phone.

'We kept going for a very long time. One of the Kew staff turned up with a defibrillator and tried to restart her heart.

'It felt like forever before the air ambulance arrived but once the paramedics were there they did everything they could to save her. It was a massive shock.'

The gardens were closed on Monday but re-opened to the public on Tuesday.

West London Coroner Alison Thompson adjourned the inquest without fixing the date of the next hearing.
