Djakadam has booked his likely place in the Cheltenham Gold Cup field in March after impressively defying top weight in the Thyestes Chase at Gowran Park.

The  success for the Ruby Walsh-ridden winner was also a record sixth win in the race for trainer Willie Mullins.

Gold Cup sponsors Betfred reacted by slashed Djakadam’s Gold Cup odds to 14-1.

The French-bred gelding will be hoping for better luck than on his previous sorties to Britain. He fell four out when still in with a chance in the JLT Novices’ Chase at last year’s Festival and faded into eighth being Many Clouds after being sent off a well-backed 5-1 favourite in the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury in November.

Mullins, who moved ahead of the previous Thyestes race record held by Jim Dreaper, said: ‘It’s fantastic to win the race six times. It took me long enough to win my first one.

‘On His Own won this off top weight and was only just beaten in a Gold Cup (last season) so we’ll have to think of going the same way with this horse.

‘We always thought he could be a Gold Cup horse. It was probably an unfair question to ask him in the Hennessy on his first run of the season but we felt he was nicely handicapped.

‘That race will take a fair bit out of him so he wouldn’t run between now and Cheltenham. The way he travelled and jumped was great, and I don’t think Ruby had a moment’s worry.’

Djakadam raced on the heels of the leaders throughout the race before smoothly moving into contention. The Job Is Right was his only danger in the straight.

He fell at the last but Walsh had still to ask for everything and looked comfortably in control.
