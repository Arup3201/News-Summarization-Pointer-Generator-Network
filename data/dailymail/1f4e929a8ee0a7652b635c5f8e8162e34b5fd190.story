Nick Faldo celebrated Europe's Ryder Cup victory at Gleneagles - but couldn't resist a dig at his own captaincy in 2008.

Faldo tweeted that the 16.5-11.5 win had been 'fantastic' but included the hashtag #sadlya'Useless'Captain. 

The Englishman has come under fire this week, after branding Sergio Garcia's 2008 performance as 'useless' during commentary.

Faldo's captaincy in 2008 has come under attack again after he criticised Spaniard Sergio Garcia

Nick Faldo has drawn criticism from some of the European players over his comments 

While Faldo praised the 34-year-old's overall contribution to the biennial contest he also claimed the player had a 'bad attitude' when he captained the European team.

But after the current crop of European stars rallied around Garcia, Faldo's own captaincy has been attacked, and the 'useless' label returned to him.

Faldo tweeted: '@rydercupEUROPE Fantastic Euro win! Will always wish I could have inspired such passion and amazing play in 08! #sadlya'Useless'Captain'
