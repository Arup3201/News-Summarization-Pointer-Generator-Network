Champion trainer Paul Nicholls has said he accepts things will not always run smoothly as young stable jockey Sam Twiston-Davies beds into his first season in the high-profile role.

The 21-year-old came in for some criticism after favourite Zarkandar hit the front in the Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot on Saturday but was ultimately beaten a head by the rallying Reve De Sivola, who was winning the race for the third year.

There was an irony in the outcome as the winner was ridden by Daryl Jacob, who operated as Nicholls' main jockey last season.

The win was Jacob's most important since deciding to go freelance rather than revert to the No 2 jockey job he had previously held behind former Nicholls' stable jockey Ruby Walsh.

Nicholls said: 'If Sam rode Zarkandar again, he would do things differently. It is the first time he has ridden him in that situation and you never stop learning. It won't be happening next time.

'He hasn't got that much experience riding in those very big races. When you appoint a young jockey you have to accept these things. He is a good lad.

'We are all competitive and don't like giving races away but he will learn from it. Ruby made plenty of mistakes when he was riding.

'Sometimes these talented horses aren't straightforward. Zarkandar wants a more competitive field where he can get a bit of cover. He is a monkey but a very talented monkey.'

Zarkandar will now be freshened up for the Cheltenham Festival.

Nicholls added: 'He will not run before the World Hurdle. That is the only race I am aiming him at.'

Zarkandar is 12-1 for the World Hurdle with sponsors Ladbrokes. The Jonjo O' Neill-trained 7-2 favourite and last season's winner More Of That could run in February after undergoing a breathing operation in the aftermath of his disappointing comeback third in Newbury's Long Distance Hurdle.

Meanwhile, Nicholls has three of the 10 possibles for the William Hill King George at Kempton on Boxing Day with Twiston-Davies on Al Ferof and Noel Fehily on favourite and his 2013 winner Silviniaco Conti.

If the going continues to dry, they could be joined by Wonderful Charm (Nick Scholfield).

Jamie Moore says he hopes to be fit to ride Nigel Twiston-Davies' Double Ross. Moore has not ridden since a fall on No Buts in the big handicap chase at Cheltenham on December 13.

Moore said: 'I have had a history of shoulder problems and I pulled some muscles. I have been having physio and fingers crossed I will be there.'

The six horses who could oppose unbeaten Champion Hurdle favourite Faugheen in the Christmas Hurdle on Boxing Day include Irving, Elite Hurdle winner Purple Bay, A Sign Of A Victory and Sgt Reckless.
