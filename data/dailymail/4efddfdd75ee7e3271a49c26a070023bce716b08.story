The White House said on Wednesday that it doesn't care that Hillary Clinton deleted emails she says were personal and not in any way related to her work at the State Department. 

Nor did federal officials review them before Clinton's team trashed them, it said, because they were part of her private communications.

'Frankly the secretary's handling of her own personal email and the maintenance of her personal email inbox is something that I'm not gonna comment on, and I'm not particularly interested in,' the chief spokesman for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Josh Earnest, told reporters on Wednesday.

He also revealed that President Barack Obama hasn't spoken to Hillary Clinton since it became public that she solely used a private email address while serving as secretary of state, saying it's  been at least a 'couple weeks' since they last talked, as far as he's aware.

President Barack Obama hasn't spoken to Hillary Clinton since it became public that she solely used a private email address while serving as secretary of state, the White House's chief spokesman said Wednesday. It's been at least a 'couple weeks' since they last talked, as far as he's aware

In an endeavor to put an end to the uproar, now in its second week, Clinton held a press conference on Wednesday at the United Nations' headquarters following her remarks to the body about women's rights

That, of course, does not mean that other senior administration officials haven't talked to Clinton or her aides since the controversy began over Clinton's personal email system, which she maintained on a private server located at her home in New York.

In an endeavor to put an end to the uproar, now in its second week, Clinton held a press conference on Wednesday at the United Nations' headquarters following her remarks to the body about women's rights.

Rather than quench the public's thirst for information, Clinton ginned up questions anew by admitting that she eliminated half of online correspondence from her tenure in the Obama administration - more than 30,000 emails - that she deemed private.

Asked about the matter on Wednesday, the president's top spokesman revealed that the executive branch did not sort through Clinton's emails before she tossed them out, so it has no idea if she obeyed federal regulations.

'The federal government did not review Secretary Clinton's personal email. Secretary Clinton's team did that,' Earnest said at his regular meeting with the White House press corps.

'It is not the practice of this administration to review the personal email of federal government employees,' he added. 'I don't know of any previous administration that's done that either.'

It was 'the responsibility of her team,' he said, to determine which emails were government property.

'Nobody has marshaled any evidence that I've seen, at least, to indicate that they've fallen short of what they said they did,' he said.

And now no one can, another reporter pointed out to the Obama administration official later, because the evidence appears to have been destroyed - a remark that earned giggles and snorting from the rest of the briefing room.

Earnest also suggested that the White House was left out of the loop on Clinton's decision to dispose of emails she says were personal in nature.

'I was not aware of the personal email habits of the secretary, who maintained her personal email inbox,' he retorted after ABC News' Jon Karl asked him if the White House knew of her plans.

Pressed to give an accounting of the email practice's of someone he does keep tabs on - the president - Earnest declined to go into detail as he has in the past, invoking security precautions. 

He did make clear that the president has followed the laws that apply to his communications, however.

'The president does take very seriously the requirements that he is under based on the Presidential Records Act,' Earnest act.  

'And I can tell you that, that all the emails the president sends are governed by that act and are properly maintained in accordance with the Presidential Records Act.'

As far as Clinton's records are concerned, Earnest acknowledged that the matter is not as simple as saying, cased closed, and moving on while putting the onus on the press to do just that. 

Given that the State Department has not finished reviewing her emails for release to Congress and to the public, it's fair to say 'there's ongoing work on this matter,' he said.

As it pertains to Clinton's compliance with the Federal Records Act, though, which requires her to give the State Department copies of all her government emails, he indicated that the White House had come to terms with the situation as it currently stands -  that Clinton's emails are out of the government's reach and only she can choose to release them.

Seemingly exasperated with reporters' nearly endless questions about Clinton's emails, Earnest also deflected a question about whether the White House would offer up the the former cabinet official's conduct as an example of 'model' behavior given that she violated State Department and administration guidelines that warn against using personal email for business purposes.

'Those guidelines have been made clear, and they've been further clarified over the last couple years as the president has taken steps to do exactly that,' he said, referring to rules the president put in place after Clinton left his service that are significantly stricter when it comes to email usage. 

So, she wouldn't be, the reporter said, prodding him. 

'I think we've been very clear about what the guidance is. That was true last week, and that is true this week,' the president's spokesman wearily responded.
