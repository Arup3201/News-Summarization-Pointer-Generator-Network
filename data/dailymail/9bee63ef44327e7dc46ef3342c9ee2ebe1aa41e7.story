Frozen: Ali Bunney, pictured with girlfriend Summer Pineda, died of hypothermia after a night out

A university student died of hypothermia after walking home from a night out in 4C temperatures wearing a short-sleeved shirt.

Ali Bunney could have been four times the drink drive limit when he attempted the nine-mile trek along a dual carriageway just days before his 21st birthday, an inquest heard.

Today a coroner said the student, whose full name was Jason Bunney but who was known as Ali, died of hypothermia contributed to by alcohol intoxication.

But his mother Marissa hit out at the conclusion - saying she still believed he was taken by someone, dumped unconscious and left to die.

Gloucestershire Coroner's Court heard Mr Bunney was 'swaying' sideways at a nightclub in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, where he was celebrating the friend's 21st birthday after a day with his girlfriend Summer Pineda.

He became separated from his friends in the early hours of February 9 last year and left the town's Subtone nightclub at around 2.30am, attempting to return to his home in Gloucester.

Friends realised the Cardiff University student was missing, but after they were unable to raise him on the phone they thought he must have taken a taxi home.

The student was found unconscious by a dog walker the next afternoon beside the A40 dual carriageway near Gloucestershire Airport.

Despite the efforts of paramedics he died later that day in the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.

Pathologist Dr Stephen Ferryman gave the cause of Ali's death as hypothermia secondary to alcohol intoxication.

The doctor said that toxicology tests showed Ali had a urine alcohol reading of 167mg, one and a half times the driving limit, and a blood alcohol reading of 56mg, below the limit.

But he said the readings would have been lower than they were 15 hours earlier, the time when Mr Bunney was last seen alive.

He calculated the student's blood alcohol level could have been as high as 326mg, more than four times the drink drive limit.

Solicitor Leo Goatley, representing the student's family, said the samples were not taken until three days after Mr Bunney's death and changes to his body could have artificially raised the readings.

'The family are obviously distressed, knowing their son, that his death certificate indicates alcohol intoxication,' he said. 'I put it to you there was some scope for error on the issue of intoxication?'

The doctor said he stood by his findings. 

The student had eaten a meal and friends described seeing him drinking pints of lager, glasses of cocktails and shots of spirits during the night out.

Alexander Petrie, who was celebrating his birthday that night, told the hearing how Mr Bunney left his hooded top and coat at a friend's house after eating the meal.

They went to a couple of pubs and carried on drinking cocktails, he said.

'I don't think Ali was too drunk - probably similar to me, I guess,' he told the court.

'At Subtone he had only one drink during the time he was there and I remember it was a rum and coke - he was drinking with one of my friends.

'Later, my friend, who he was spending most of his time with, said 'Where's Ali?' and we couldn't see him. We checked the whole club.'

Mr Petrie said it was at around 2.30am when his friend 'just disappeared'.

He said: 'At that point I just assumed he had got a taxi home as he had done this on one or two occasions after a night out in Cheltenham.'

Asked about the weather, Mr Petrie said: 'I remember it being very cold and I think it was raining quite a bit.'

He also said the group of friends were not drinking heavily and Mr Bunney had drunk 'just as much as the rest of us'.

'I definitely cannot say how much he had to drink,' he added.

Matthew Davis, another friend celebrating Mr Petrie's birthday, said he and Mr Bunney spoke regularly during the night.

'Ali was fine, he did not seem drunk,' he told the court in a written statement.

Mr Davis said that by the time he was in the nightclub he was drunk - describing himself as 'eight out of 10' on a drunkenness scale - and he assumed Mr Bunney was as well.

Response: Paramedics and a fire crew from the airport came to the student's aid but he could not be saved

One friend said of Mr Bunney (pictured with his girlfriend): 'Ali had a drink in his hand and was swaying'

'I guess he was drunk because we had been drinking a similar amount,' he said.

Matthew James, who was also out that night, described seeing Mr Bunney unsteady on his feet in the nightclub.

'Ali had a drink in his hand and was swaying from side to side but did not look out of control,' he said in a written statement. 

The court heard police had received reports that a man was walking along the A40 at 3.15am but were unable to find anyone.

At the start of the inquest Mr Goatley expressed concern  that a police officer due to give evidence would not be attending because of long term illness.

Pc Simon Kilmister, who responded to the 999 call, said in a written statement that he travelled the 'whole length' of both carriageways of the by-pass in his patrol car but did not see anyone.

But Mr Goatley said there were 'crucial questions' the family wanted to ask the officer about whether he did in fact check the whole length of the by-pass when asked to do so by his control room.

'He did half the journey and then didn't actually check up to the Gloucester end of the road,' said Mr Goatley. 

'That raises the question about what sort of duty of care the police have to the public.'

Gloucestershire Coroner Katy Skerrett said the cause of death would be given as hypothermia caused by alcohol intoxication.

'This was a young man who had been out drinking with friends and had a very good, fun evening,' she said.

'He had been drinking a significantly large amount of alcohol during the evening with his friends.

'For whatever reason, he chose to depart from the plans of going back to a friend's house and it seems more likely than not that he was trying to make his way home.

'Due to the amount of alcohol he had consumed and this was a very cold and wet night - both those two factors got the better of this young man, which led to him being found.

'Everything was done to save him and I can find no criticism of the attempts to resuscitate him.

'The appropriate conclusion is a short-form conclusion. A tragic death and a short-form conclusion will be an alcohol-related death.' 

But speaking after the inquest, Mr Bunney's parents Nigel and Marissa questioned the coroner's findings. 

'There are a lot of unanswered questions,' Mr Bunney said.

His wife added: 'I don't believe he walked all that way. It's a mother's instinct. I don't believe he walked four miles in an hour - someone has dumped him there.

'I don't believe it is the right verdict. As a mother I believe he was dumped there unconscious but no one believes me.'

Mrs Bunney also questioned whether the man seen walking along the A40 by a passing motorist was in fact her son.

'The witness was saying that he was wearing dark clothing - he didn't even see his face,' she said. 'He was inside the car, so he cannot be sure it was Ali. People do walk along the  by-pass.'

Mrs Bunney added: 'I always pray for him and pray for justice for Ali.'
