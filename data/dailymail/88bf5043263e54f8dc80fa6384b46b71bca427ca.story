Prime Minister David Cameron has left political talks in Northern Ireland claiming that no deal between the opposing sides is possible, with Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams branding the attempt as 'amateurish and ham fisted'. 

Mr Cameron and his Irish counterpart Enda Kenny held late-night talks with the major Northern Ireland political leaders in Stormont which ended at 1.30am. The pair returned to the talks at 8am but left within an hour. 

The two prime ministers had been expected to remain at the talks for the rest of the day before returning to London and Dublin respectively.

The two governments tried to convince local political leaders to compromise over the issue of welfare reform. Mr Cameron offered a £1 billion financial package to the devolved government if they could agree on a deal.   

Sinn Fein's president Gerry Adams attacked the talks on Twitter: '2 Govts exiting after the most amateurish ham fisted episode I have ever been involved in.'  

Many of the region’s politicians are unhappy at the scale of the financial offer made, with some describing it as “derisory”. 

Leaving Stormont House this morning, Mr Cameron said: 'We have made good progress overnight and today but a deal is not going to be possible today.'

He said: ‘I was putting on the table, potentially, if a number of things could be agreed, what amounted to almost £1 billion spending power for the Executive over the coming years. Spending power they want to adjust the situation in Northern Ireland, where the state and the public sector is so big and the private sector needs to grow.’

As well as long-standing disputes over flags, parades and the toxic legacy of the past, the five parties in the power-sharing coalition are trying to achieve consensus on budgetary problems facing the devolved institutions, particularly the impasse over the non-implementation of the UK Government’s welfare reforms in Northern Ireland.

The structures and governance arrangements at Stormont are also on the agenda.

But the most pressing issue is the budgetary situation.

The Northern Ireland executive is stalled over an impasse over the implementation of welfare reforms. 

Sinn Fein and the SDLP claim that the changes will disproportionally hit the poorest members of their community. 

The Democratic Unionist Party said it was willing to implement the planned changes.  

Chancellor George Osborne offered the Northern Ireland Assembly the chance to set their own corporation tax rates - pending an agreement on welfare reform. 

Prime Minister David Cameron pledged a £1bn package if the main parties could come to an agreement. 

Unionist and Nationalist politicians also face difficulties over long-running issues concerning the flying of flags and parades. 

Stormont has already had to seek a £100 million loan from Westminster to plug a major budgetary gap. 

Unless the parties can agree a budget, the Northern Ireland executive faces bankruptcy.  

Ministers in Belfast have already had to ask for an emergency £100 million loan from the Treasury to balance their books this financial year, and if a deal on welfare reform is not agreed they will face about £200 million of Government penalties for non-implementation.

As it is unlikely the administration would be able to absorb such a financial burden, the future of the Executive effectively depends on a resolution to the welfare reform issue. 

Mr Cameron said the situation was better than yesterday but 'intensive work' needed to be done to ensure the Northern Ireland Executive's budget was sustainable.

'I think things are better today than they were yesterday I think a deal is possible. It's possible because I think the parties have done a lot of good work on the issues that need to be settled - the issue of how to manage parades, how to handle the past, the issues of flying flags.

'The real work that still needs to be done is to make sure that the budget of the Northern Ireland Executive is sustainable and works, so intensive work needs to be done between the parties on that issue.'

With £1 billion of spending power on the table, Mr Cameron said a 'comprehensive agreement' was needed rather than 'simply some words about these issues'.

Mr Kenny said he also believed a deal was possible and the politicians 'will be able to conclude the outstanding areas of disagreement on the matters that we have discussed'.

The talks will continue today, discussing Northern Ireland's history, the issue of flags, parades as well as welfare reform. 

Sinn Fein’s Martin McGuinness criticised the offer: ‘Whatever you have been told by the British Prime Minister David Cameron, there was no credible financial package offered to Executive ministers, to allow us to combat the austerity agenda that this British government has been inflicting on us over the course of the last four-and-a-half years.'

Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson said that the talks would continue despite Mr Cameron's departure.

Speaking to reporters outside Stormont, the DUP leader said: ‘Anybody who thought we could have reasonably concluded negotiations on a series of issues seriously underestimated the task that we had at hand. As far as we are concerned, the process continues. We have a job of work to do. The absence of the prime minister does not bring that work to an end. There is a responsibility placed on the parties in Northern Ireland by the electorate to get the job done and it is the view of this party that there is still work to be completed.

‘As far as the core issue of the financial issues around Stormont are concerned, I don’t believe that we sufficiently challenged the prime minister in relation to what his bottom line was on financial issues, and we didn’t do that because we had not ourselves been able to complete agreement on other aspects of the financial issues, namely the matter of welfare reform.

‘I think the prime minister would have had more give in him if he had seen that that issue was going to be resolved. I am still unaware what the final position is in relation to Sinn Fein as far as welfare reform is concerned.'

Mr Robinson said his party welcomed some of the proposals concerning parades and dealing with Northern Ireland's past. 

He said he was prepared to continue with the talks: ‘I want to go back down again. I want to ensure that we have done everything possible to reach agreement on those issues. But it is essential in the climate that we are presently in, that we do not squander money, and that means we have a very tight fiscal position to develop, that means we have to resolve the internal financial issues as far as the executive is concerned.' 

He added: 'We want to continue to see if we can close a deal with the other parties, and I don’t in anyway view this as being the end of the process simply because the prime minister has left to carry out other duties that he has to perform.'

A spokeswoman for the prime minister said Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers, pictured, had spent more than 85 hours with the political parties in advance of the current failed negotiations

A Downing Street spokeswoman dismissed Mr Adams' criticism claiming that Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers had been extensively involved in the talks process. 

She said: 'I think altogether, before they met yesterday, that was 85 hours sat round the table trying to resolve these issues.

'The PM went yesterday and himself spent 10 hours yesterday and a couple of hours this morning trying to resolve the issues.

'The Government is absolutely committed, as the PM said yesterday morning, to taking this opportunity to move forward and make progress, but it is down to the political parties in Northern Ireland to find resolution on issues like welfare reform and so-called legacy issues.

'The offer on the table is £1 billion of financial spending power. That would enable the Northern Ireland Executive and authorities to address some of the difficult reforms that they need to make. That is there for the taking by the political parties in Northern Ireland if they work to resolve the issues.

'There is a heads of agreement document on the table for discussion. What we need to see is progress on those issues which need to be resolved by the political parties.'

The spokeswoman said despite Mr Cameron's departure from the talks, the financial offer remained. 

She added: 'The point about the £1 billion that is on the table is that it will help to address the situation in Northern Ireland, where they need to reform the state and public sector and invest in the private sector and help drive the economy and create jobs. Those are all things that matter to people in Northern Ireland.'
