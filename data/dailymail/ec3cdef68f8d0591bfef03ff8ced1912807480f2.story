A cat clung to the roof of a van as it hurtled down a motorway at 70mph for 12 miles.

The feline, named Kick Buttowski after the cartoon stuntman, held onto a ladder which was attached to the roof of an electrician's van during the high-speed journey down the M1.

The pet has now been reunited with his owners after escaping unhurt from his spontaneous motorway ride.

Daredevil: The cat, called Kick Buttowski, clung to the roof of the van as it hurtled down the M1 in Leicestershire at 70mph

The van driver, Helen Stevens, pulled over to check what was wrong after another motorist flashed her a warning, and was gob-smacked when she found the 18-month-old cat clinging to her roof.

The 30-year-old electrician said: 'The cat was on the roof rack, which had some stepladders on it, and was just clinging on for dear life. He was wide-eyed and looking terrified.

'It had to have got on at the petrol station we stopped at in Melton and we’d already gone all the way down the A46 and the M1 and were probably doing up to 70mph.'

She took the cat to Bell, Brown and Bentley veterinary clinic in Stoneygate, Leicester, where he was found to be uninjured but appeared very shaken by the ordeal.

Together again: Ellise Pepper and her son Connor Russell, five , are reunited with their pet after vets published an online appeal to find its owners

The vets put an appeal online where it was spotted by Ellise Pepper, mum of Kick’s owner, five-year-old Connor Russell.

Connor, who was reunited with Kick on Saturday, said: 'He held on and he didn’t fall off, but I bet he was scared.'

The family began to worry about their pet's whereabouts when he did not return for dinner on Friday evening.

His mother said: 'He’s never done anything like this before, although he does hate to be on his own and likes to follow the children to nursery!'

She was astonished to see his photo which was accompanied by a story about his adventure.

'I was on Facebook and my friend shared the link and I thought: ‘That’s our cat!’

'I was overwhelmed and quite upset about it, but then I read that he wasn’t hurt.

'He’s usually a pretty laid-back cat.'

Amanda Walker, a nurse at Bell, Brown and Bentley, said: 'It’s miraculous that he didn’t fall off the roof because the car was going quite fast at times.

'To have been clinging onto the van since Melton is just amazing. He’s a nice boy and although he was shaken up, he was very friendly.

'Before the owners got in touch on Saturday we looked after him at the vet and named him Batman because he’s black with a white face and big ears. And he’s certainly a superhero.'

The terrifying journey: The cat managed to stay on the roof despite traveling at speeds of up to 70mph along the A46 and M1 before the van driver pulled over on the M69
