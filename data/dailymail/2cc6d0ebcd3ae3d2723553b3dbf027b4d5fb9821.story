Women who were sexually abused as schoolgirls decades ago have bravely come forward to talk about being molested by a respected and well-connected teacher at the prestigious Potomac School.

Laura Gill was just 14 when Christopher Kloman molested her at his home. She told her parents who reported the attack to the elite establishment in McLean, Virginia.

However rather than being reported to the police and losing his job, the teenage girl was told that Kloman would undergo counseling and was allowed to return to Potomac - where she faced him in the school hallways.

Christopher Kloman was sentenced to 43 years in jail last month for the sexual abuse of girls aged 12 to 14 at Potomac School in McLean, Virginia 40 years ago

Kloman, now 74, was finally sentenced to 43 years in Fairfax County last month for the sexual abuse of young girls in his care. 

One of his victims came forward in 2011 
after learning that her abuser was now teaching at
her son's school.

Kloman was arrested in November 2012. He pleaded guilty in August to the molestations of Laura Gill, Anne Sullivan, Jane Gould, Kim Shorb and Julia Craighill.

The disgraced teacher was accused of molesting his 
victims, aged 12 to 14, after luring them to isolated locations, some under 
the guise of helping them with homework.

Kloman, known to students as 'The Wolf', attacked women who are now all in their fifties and sixties. Many have carried the physical and psychological scars of what happened to them during their school days for life.

Ms Gill, now 51, was one of five women who have revealed their identity after the abuse. The group, who are being represented by Gloria Allred, are demanding answers from the school on how Kloman was allowed to continue in his job.

Most of the victims said they did not tell their parents about the abuse - but Ms Gill and another victim said their parents did tell Potomac.

Two former headmasters that Kloman worked for said that they were not aware of the abuse, according to the Washington Post.

John Kowalik, the head of Potomac since August, told the  Post: 'What has happened to these women over the years, I can’t comprehend. It deserves our best effort to find out what the school actually knew and when.'

Sex abuse has been revealed at the Potomac School in McLean, Virginia by one teacher who was employed from the mid-60s until 1994

One former student Cricket Beauregard, who was not part of the criminal case, said she was abused by Kloman when she went to his house to clean in a trade for driving lessons.

He opened the door in a bathrobe and once she was inside, grinded against her. He told her he had done the same thing with her friend - and then Kloman raped the teenager.

Ms Beauregard told the Post: 'It destroyed my internal compass. I didn’t know what was right or wrong anymore. I couldn’t make decisions for myself...I was an automaton.'

Although the student believed she was the only one he had harmed, Kloman had attacked a long line of girls - including one whom he asked to his home for a swim; one babysitting his son; one in his classroom.

At least 15 women have come forward to accuse their former teacher of abuse at different times from the mid-1960s until the mid-1980s. 

Not only was he not arrested or fired,
Kloman was promoted by Potomac before leaving in 1994 - with a 
heartfelt yearbook dedication.

The
pedophile then moved on to teach at Barnesville School in Dickerson, 
Maryland for a brief time before popping up at the Washington Episcopal 
School of Bethesda in 1995 as assistant head. 

The
secret had been long-buried by Kloman's victims - some of whom blamed 
themselves for the attacks or spent years avoiding relationships with 
men.

However Ms Sullivan told the Post that she was walking down the hallway of Washington Episcopal School when she spotted Kloman. 

She told the Post: 'I thought, ''Oh, man. I can’t live with myself anymore.'''

The next week, Ms Sullivan paid a 
visit to the police. A year-long investigation was launched and with 
each woman who came forward, the group gained strength in learning they 
were not alone.

Many attended Kloman's trial and watched him sentenced to what will likely be the rest of his natural life in jail.

The Potomac is known as a school popular among Washington's political elite for their children's education.

When
Kloman was sentenced, he received several letters from high-profile 
supporters whose children has been educated at the school - including a former Solicitor-General.

Kenneth Starr, who sparked the Monica Lewinsky scandal with his report on President Clinton, came out in support of Kloman.

Starr wrote to a Virginia judge, pleading to overturn the 43-year prison sentence handed down to his family friend in October.

Yet despite his victims' tearful testimony in court and Kloman's own admission of guilty, Starr and several other high-profile supporters do not believe he should serve a prison sentence.

In the letter sent from Starr and his wife, the couple wrote that Kloman should be spared jail because 'he took the time to chat' with their daughter.

They added that he had 'made a concerted effort to correct his behavior of the past' and suggested a community sentence would be a more fitting punishment.
