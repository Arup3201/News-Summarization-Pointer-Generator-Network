Stores enjoyed their busiest weekend of the year as millions of shoppers finally came out to snap up cut price deals after months of disappointing sales.  

Queues formed outside some shopping centres ahead of opening times today and an estimated £1billion was spent on Saturday alone.

But experts warned that retailers still faced an 'austerity Christmas' with profits down on last year and a likely 'High Street bloodbath' in January with up to 3,000 stores facing closure.

They suggested that because so many 
cut-price deals had been needed to lure customers, the heavy footfall 
would not necessarily translate into large profits.

Around 11 million shoppers spent up to
£1.5 million a minute after much of the country left buying presents to
the final full weekend before Christmas. 

Capital Shopping Centres, which owns 
Glasgow's Braehead, Gateshead's Metrocentre, Cardiff's St David's, 
Manchester's Trafford Centre and Lakeside in Thurrock, said its 14 sites
had been 'packed' throughout Saturday and Sunday.

John Lewis also reported record sales 
of £133.1 million in the week to Saturday, which was 10.6 per cent 
higher than a year ago, and the highest weekly figure it has ever 
achieved.

Most consumers were attracted by a 
raft of bargains, with women's clothes store Jigsaw offering 30 per cent
party wear and half price Scalextric sets available at Modelzone.

Others defied the economic downturn to
splash out on expensive items, with Selfridges reporting a surge in 
sales in  Van Clef and Cartier diamond necklaces and luxury watches.

There were long queues in the Bullring, Birmingham, as more than 320,000 people packed the shopping centre to get last-minute Christmas bargains.

Famed for its bronze bull outside and silver snake skinned exterior, escalators and aisles in the three-storey complex were jammed with shoppers.

Stores in the centre have reported a business boom in the run up to Christmas, with opening hours extended to cope with extra demand.

Tim Walley, general manager at Bullring, said: 'We saw in the region of 200,000 shoppers visit the centre yesterday.

'With pay day coming early we expected shoppers to come out in their thousands today as they pick up their last few Christmas presents, and they have.

'Top selling gifts have included Chanel Coco Mademoiselle beauty sets for women at Selfridges and a return to the iconic Levi 501 jeans.

'We expect to see a further 120,000 shoppers visit the centre today.'

But despite the rammed shopping 
centres and high streets, the Centre for Economics and Business Research
predicted that overall sales in December would be down 1.7 per cent 
compared to November, and 0.3 per cent lower than a year ago.

Chief executive Douglas McWilliams said that consumer confidence was 'shot to pieces' amid the economic gloom.

He said: 'Retailers are in for an 
austerity Christmas. 'Those who have left their Christmas shopping late 
can expect bargains aplenty both before and after Christmas Day because 
retailers are working hard to shift excess stock and justify town-centre
overheads going forward.'

A spokeswoman British Retail 
Consortium said: 'This was a make or break weekend for many retailers 
who were hoping for a big turnout after a disappointing few months.

'It does appear that large numbers 
went to the shops and that this was probably the busiest shopping 
weekend of the year, but it is too early yet to say whether this has 
translated into significant profits.

'Stores put on so many cut price deals to attract consumers that profit margins will inevitably have been squeezed.'

Retail analyst Jonathan De Mello, from
the CB Richard Ellis consultancy, warned that up to 30,000 shop workers
could lose their jobs at the end of Christmas as a swathe of small 
independent retailers and some major high street names are forced to 
close as banks call in heavy debts.

It is the most gloomy prediction since
Christmas 2008, when the UK economy was at its worst point since the 
start of the downturn. Currently 15 per cent of shops in Britain are 
vacant. This is expected to rise by 1 per cent by the end of festive 
period, he said.

This would lead to around 3,000 shops closing and between 20,000 to 30,000 workers being laid off.

Mr De Mello said: 'The country is 
facing a High Street bloodbath immediately after Christmas which will 
have a devastating impact on shopworkers and other businesses that 
supply shops.

'It is unlikely that retailers will survive the next rental quarter unscathed.  

'Whilst the economy is not officially 
back in recession as yet, we are very much in a retail recession.  
'Whilst banks may be willing to let some of these retailers trade 
through Christmas, when the majority of profit is delivered for most 
retailers, those that struggle over the Christmas period may find the 
banks pulling the plug on them, and this could well include a couple of 
big high street names.  

'The government needs to act soon not 
just to attempt to save small town centres that are potentially in 
terminal decline anyway, but to protect some of the larger retail chains
that are clearly very vulnerable at the moment.'

More than 11 million people are expected to spend more than £1 billion at £1.5 million a minute, according to a report by shopping comparison website Kelkoo
