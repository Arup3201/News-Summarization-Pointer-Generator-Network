Michael Essien finds it hard to contemplate the thought —next week Frank Lampard will, injury permitting, return to Stamford Bridge as a Manchester City player.

He might once again score a goal which could prove crucial in tipping the two-horse title race in City’s favour — just as he did in scoring the equalising goal against Chelsea in September.

For Essien, stalwart of Jose Mourinho’s greatest Chelsea side, a Champions League winner, and Lampard’s long-time midfield partner, that would be unthinkable.

Michael Essien has mobilised an army of footballers to help fight Ebola in West Africa.

The Ghanaian had to deny he was suffering from Ebola after reports surfaced that he had contracted the virus — but the incident has inspired him and his wife, Akosua, to campaign against the stigma of the disease, which has claimed more than 8,000 lives since last year.

Rio Ferdinand, Samuel Eto’o and Fernando Torres have all signed up.

He has resisted the opportunity to return to the Premier League preferring to stay at AC Milan rather than play against Chelsea.

And he is unsure how Lampard will be able to keep his emotion in check for a game which would be highly charged even in normal circumstances but which is also a critical game in the destination of the title.

‘It will be difficult — I don’t know how he’s going to do it,’ said Essien. 

‘It will be a very strange situation. I cannot see myself doing that against Chelsea. ’Of course, should AC Milan return to the Champions League, Essien might one day face his former team.

‘That would be a bit different,’ Essien insists.‘But with a different team in England, going back to play your old club when you’ve been there for so long... wow! It’s going to be difficult. But, at the end of the day it’s another game and he’s professional.’

Despite his own reservations of making the kind of switch Lampard has, Essien is confident that Chelsea fans will receive his former team-mate warmly. 

He was applauded by away fans at the Etihad earlier in the season, despite scoring the equalising goal. But the murky details of his move to City, which was initially announced as a loan from New York City, have turned some Chelsea fans against him, as has the fact that he has turned out to be a crucial player in the title race, contributing valuable goals as City chase Chelsea. 

But Essien believes that Chelsea fans will not forget what Lampard gave the club. 

‘Well, you know how fans are but I believe the Chelsea fans are always going to give him their warmth and respect everything that he did for the club,’ he said. 'I’m sure that they will give him a welcome.’ 

Former Chelsea manager Glenn Hoddle agrees with Essien and says that Lampard deserves to be treated well next Saturday. 

‘I’m hoping he receives the kind of reception reserved for much-loved returning players,’ he said. 

‘The key point that is sometimes lost in the confusion over whether Frank was joining New York City or Manchester City — which was admittedly a strange situation — is that Chelsea didn’t offer Frank a new deal last summer. 

‘The club clearly decided they could do without him. Maybe his opportunities would have been limited, given how strong Chelsea have been this season. 

'But from that point on, Frank had to find himself a team. Perhaps you could understand why some fans were upset with him if he had been agitating for a move or demanding to leave even though Chelsea wanted him. 

‘But he only left to play for someone else when the club didn’t want him. It seems pretty clear that he loves the club and the fans and always will.’

Lampard will not overshadow the key issue of the day, which is whether Chelsea can open up an eight-point gap with 15 games to play. For many that would seem an unassailable lead. ‘City have to get something from the game,’ said Hoddle. 

‘To get back eight points between now and the end of the season looks tough. It’s one thing to close an eight-point gap before Christmas but with just 15 games to go would be hard. Chelsea they would have to lose three games to close that gap.’ 

Essien is of the same mind. ‘In England you can never say the title is decided in January but if they win the game, they will give them a massive advantage,’ he said. 

‘It’s a big week with the Liverpool semi-final as well but Jose Mourinho loves dealing with these kind of games and will always get the best out of his players.'
