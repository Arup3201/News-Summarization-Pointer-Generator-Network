Survivors of Typhoon Haiyan are still desperately hunting for their missing loved ones in the aftermath of the worst storm to ever hit land.

Many families were separated in the super typhoon which ripped apart entire villages with winds of up to 147mph and terrifying 20ft waves.

More than 4,000 people were killed, around 1.5million have been left homeless and countless others are still missing.

With roads and communication lines destroyed, those who reached safety have been left with little choice but to sit and wait for news about those they have lost.

But CNN has launched a missing people appeal feature on its iReport platform.

Reunited: Aisa Aigbe posted this picture of her mother and family after she lost contact with them following Typhoon Haiyan. She has now found out her mother is alive but her two brothers are still missing

Good news: Distraught Andrew Enderez was working in the United Arab Emirates when the storm struck. He posted this picture of his family on CNN iReport's and was soon told that his wife and children are alive

Many survivors have already reported a loved one missing through CNN, posting pictures and their details, along with desperate pleas for any information that may help track them down.

And amazing, some have already managed to find each other because of it.

Michael Sacahon used the feature to ask for help to contact his mother Caramen who lived in one of the worst hit areas in Tacloban. He had no way of reaching her as many communication lines were destroyed in the storm.

He wrote: 'I only wish to check the current condition of my mother in Tacloban. If she can be assisted to reach Manila, my brother and sister are in Luzon and can take better care of her there.'

And incredibly, he was finally able to reach his missing mother shortly after his appeal.

He wrote: 'Thanks GOD and we finally able to call her yesterday evening and my mother is fine. I would like to thanks CNN ireport staff for their unending help for everyone who are in need. You gave us hope when everything else seems hopeless. More power to your show! GOD bless every one!'

Andrew Enderez, who works as an engineer abroad in the United Arab Emirates, got in touch with iReport as he was desperate for any news about his wife and children who live in Tacloban in the Philippines.

He wrote: 'Glimpses of my wife and kids smiling at me every time I come home for a vacation is permanently stuck on my mind. I can’t fathom that such a tragedy I see only in the movies could happen to me.'

Mr Enderez has now found out his family are alive but is still trying to find out more information.

He said: 'It felt like music to my ears having heard the voice of my eldest son telling me that they are all fine. Four hours later, I was able to talk to my wife who was still crying and is in a state of shock.

'Thank you for your concern and prayers. They hang on literally for their lives and survived this once in a lifetime catastrophic event.

'I would love that CNN will join me to honor our Nanny, Poyen Modesto, a partially blind but courageous person who has really helped my Family during those trying times.

'I will see to it that I can introduce our Nanny to the whole world how brave & strong she is. I love you CNN from the bottom of my heart.'

Working in conjunction with Google's crisis finder map, CNN’s iReport allows people to post information about a missing person, such as their name, age, city and a photograph, in an effort to reconnect them.

CNN said iReport is being well-used after the storm, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yolanda, in a similar way to after the Haiti earthquake in 2010.

Aisa Aigbe used the tool to ask for information about her mother and other members of her family who live in Tacloban, one of the hardest hit areas by Typhoon Haiyan.

She last spoke with her mother on Thursday morning and was worried about her condition because of the loss of contact.

Ms Aigbe wrote: 'I haven't heard any more after the typhoon hit. I feel so miserable here and have been asking for help from everyone, but I still have not been able to locate my mom and the rest of my family. I'm desperate for answers.'

But she has since had the amazing news that her mother is safe.

She wrote: 'Thank God. My friend who's volunteer to help victims was able to locate my Mom. She's safe although they were starving but still thankful they're safe and alive. I just hope they find my two brothers and they can evacuate the place. Thank you for all the help.'

Andrionni Ribo contacted the site about his missing 65-year-old father who had left California in October on an annual trip to his ancestral home in Haro, Philippines.

After the typhoon, Mr Ribo couldn't get in contact with his father for several days. When he finally got in touch, his father said he had survived but was desperately looking for food.

Thanks to the CNN iReporter, Mr Ribo and his mother got the good news that Josef Ribo made it to Ormoc and was waiting to board a ferry to Cebu.

Ribo's brother, who stayed in Tacloban during the storm, was killed in the typhoon. He will be buried Friday.

Last Wednesday, traffic to CNN's website from the Philippines was the highest in the world for a stage - and later on, only second to the US because of the iReport.

Dean Hayes was one of many to contact CNN. He was trying to find his brother Stephen and his family, who are just west of Tacloban in Burauen, Philippians.

He last spoke with him a week before the storm and while he soon managed to get hold of other family members, had not heard from his brother.

But after a televised appeal on CNN for information about Mr Hayes' brother, he got some good news.

He wrote: 'Many thanks for the televised report on my missing brother [it was featured on CNNI TV] I'm please to say that he has been found alive and well.'

Sarah Brown, the London-based producer of iReport - which has been going since 2006 - spoke to MailOnline about how CNN came up with the idea.

She said: ‘After this terrible story we started noticing one or two people posting iReports, saying they are looking for family members or friends.

‘We thought this is something very important, so let’s look at putting together a missing persons assignment, then we can vet and approve it and get it out there.

‘It’s not the first time we’ve done this. During the Haiti earthquake, we got frantic iReports in the US, Dubai, Hong Kong, all searching for loved ones.’

Struggling: The United Nations estimates that 13 million people were affected by Super Typhoon Haiyan with around 1.9 million losing their homes

She added that a lack of normal communications is a problem in the Philippines following the storm, and that iReport is a way of helping people make contact.

‘People can’t get through, they’re worried and I think a lot of them just felt if we’ve got an extra platform to get the message out, it might make a difference.

‘One gentleman emailed in on behalf of his Filipino maid, who was looking for her daughter. He emailed us about a day later to say she got a phone call that her daughter was safe. She had had to walk three hours, but managed to put in a call.’

Ms Brown added:  ‘We just hope that everyone can find their loved ones, but I think the most important thing is that if you have a community that gives you fantastic content day in day out, the least you can do is help them.

‘It does give you a feeling of relief (when people are reconnected). We hope to follow up these stories in six months time and see how they’re getting on.

‘For us the situation doesn’t end when they’re found - they’re still in desperate need of food, shelter and help.’

CNN’s iReport team continue to upload missing persons information and updates from iReport to Google’s Person Finder site which was used to help find missing people after the Haiti earthquake.

A Google spokesperson said: ‘Google Person Finder was initially created by Google volunteers in response to the Haiti earthquake in January 2010, and today contains contributions from many volunteers inside and outside of Google. It was used again for the earthquakes in Chile, Yushu, and Japan, and now runs at http://google.org/personfinder.'
