Chris Smalling is happy to wait until the summer to begin negotiations over a new contract at Manchester United.

Smalling's current deal expires at the end of next season and he is keen to stay at Old Trafford.

The England defender is enjoying life under Louis van Gaal, who has selected him in United's last five games.

'Yes, I do,' Smalling said when asked if he wanted to stay at United long term.

'I am enjoying it. I always have, and if I can contribute then I am happy to stay for as long as they want me.'

When asked if he was happy to wait until the end of the season to start negotiations, Smalling replied: 'Yeah, and finish as strong as we can.

'If I can contribute as much as I can then I will be very happy.

'I have not even really discussed it with anyone.

'It's a case of the manager showing his faith in me and if I am playing I am happy and we have another eight games to finish as strong as we can.

'There aren't any negotiations (under way) that I am aware of. I don't really take care of that.'

Smalling is on England duty after helping United beat Liverpool at Anfield in the Barclays Premier League

Roy Hodgson's contract runs to the end of Euro 2016 and Smalling would like to see the England manager stay on beyond that tournament.

Hodgson signed Smalling for Fulham seven years ago and the defender is a big fan of the 67-year-old.

'Ever since I have worked with Roy, he has shown faith in all the players, especially the younger players,' Smalling said.

'We have all enjoyed training with him and obviously he is focusing on until next summer. I would be very happy to work with him for a longer period.'

Hodgson maintained his 100 per cent post-World Cup record on Friday when England beat Lithuania 4-0 at Wembley.

The Three Lions will make it eight wins in a row if they beat Italy in Turin on Tuesday.

Smalling thinks Hodgson has turned England into a fearsome team since their World Cup debacle.

'A lot of teams will be frightened and hopefully on Tuesday we will show that,' he said.

'I think we are on the verge of something special. We are winning games. We are being ruthless and we are really together.'
