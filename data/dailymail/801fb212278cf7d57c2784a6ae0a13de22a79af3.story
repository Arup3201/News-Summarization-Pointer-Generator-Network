She's toured a museum and hosted the Panamanian president on a state visit already this week but there appears to be no let up in Queen Letizia's busy schedule.

Today, Europe's newest monarch spent the day chairing a charity meeting at the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid, where she was joined by some of Spain's ministers.

Among them were Ana Mato, the minister of health, social services and equality, and Ana Pastor, the minister for public works, but despite the high calibre guests, all eyes were on the Queen herself.

All business: Letizia was back at work in Madrid today as she chaired a charity meeting on disabilities

Glamorous: The royal looked every inch the stylish businesswoman in her cream jacket and black skirt

Glamorous in a tailored cream jacket, a black pencil skirt and her habitual pearl drop earrings, Letizia cut a businesslike figure as she opened the meeting.

Along with the two ministers, Queen Letizia is part of the council of the Royal Board for Disability and has long worked to improve the lot of those with physical and mental problems.

Work is something the former newsreader has plenty of experience of and, fresh
 from a month-long break in Mallorca with her husband King Felipe, 46, it has been back to work with a vengeance for Letizia.

Yesterday saw the 41-year-old royal welcome Lorena Castillo de Varela, Panama's first lady, to the Zarzuela Palace as part of an official state visit.

Back to work: Following a month off in Mallorca, the Spanish royals have returned to a packed schedule

Pretty in a
 cream dress embroidered with seed pearls, Letizia showed off her 
glamorous sense of style, accessorising the look with nude patent peep 
toe shoes and pearl earrings.

Not
 to be outdone, King Felipe, dapper in a dark suit, showed off his salt-and-pepper holiday beard - a new look for 
the usually clean-shaven royal.

The visit was one of the first engagements
 of an action-packed schedule planned for the next month, including a 
visit to New York.Â 

There, the Spanish king will address the UN General Assembly in a bid to secure one of the seats on the Security Council for Spain.
