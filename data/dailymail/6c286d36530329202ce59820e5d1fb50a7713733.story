He's driven thousands of cars over 20 years of MoT testing, so you can understand why Andrew Mitchinson was 'gutted' when his first crash just happened to be in a Lamborghini Murcielago worth £220,000.

He blamed the wet road, the leaves... and the ‘featherweight’ accelerator that takes the 6.5 litre Italian supercar from 0-60mph in a heart-stopping 3.5 seconds.

Mr Mitchinson said he accidentally clipped a kerb, spun and collided with a parked Ford Focus.

Written off: Owner Stephen Leahy with his £220,000 Lamborghini which suffered £87,000 worth of damage in the crash

Careful: Mr Leahy said : Andrew Mitchinson said he had treated his Lamborghini like 'Driving Miss Diasy' before it was crashed by Mitchinson

The supercar had been booked into the Station Garage owned by Mr Mitchinson's father Alan in Staveley, near Kendal, Cumbria.

'I was in second gear just going up the road to try the brakes. I don’t honestly know what happened. I wouldn’t have been doing more than 25-30mph - if that.

'It was unreal. I was gutted because I knew it was an expensive car,' said Mr Mitchinson.

The car belongs to millionaire Lakeland 
hotelier and businessman Stephen Leahy.The head-turning 640bhp car, of 
which just 20 LP640 models were made, has 24,500 miles on the clock. It 
has a top speed of 211mph.

Mr Leahy, 46, from Greater Manchester, described it as ‘my beautiful, beautiful car.’

He believes the accident has lowered the car’s potential sell-on value.

He said it has affected its provenance, the unique identity, and guarantee that it has not been seriously damaged, that other buyers would be looking for.

Mr Mitchinson put the damage at around £20,000 and said he believed the car was worth around £95,000 on the open market.

His father, Alan, said: 'It's the first time he’s had an accident in a customer’s car and he’s been here 20 years. He has driven thousands, from Ferraris to Aston Martins.

'With the Lamborghini being a four-wheel drive, it has to be road tested to test the efficiency of the brakes. You can’t put it through the rolling road brake-tester here because it would damage it.'

Alan said his son was insured to drive the vehicle, and that all the cars the garage took out were fully insured.

'My insurance company is aware of what cars we deal with here, and have been on the phone. I’d expect my premium to go up a bit now.'

A policeman is understood to have been walking through the village at around the time of the accident and was quickly on the scene.

A Cumbria Police spokeswoman said the incident was reported to them at 11.56am on November 6 by the owner of the Ford Focus, who found the garage’s insurance details on its windscreen.

The spokesman said that inquiries were on-going into the incident, and that no-one had been arrested or charged.
