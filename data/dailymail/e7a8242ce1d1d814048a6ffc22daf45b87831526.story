A notorious thief dubbed the 'Worm Burglar' because he crawled on his stomach to avoid infra-red alarm systems has been jailed for four-and-a-half-years.

Leigh Cassidy, 47, carried out a string of burglaries across the Greater Manchester area by wriggling along the floor to avoid activating the alarms.

During his spree between March 2013 and May last year, he targeted five pubs in Manchester and one in New Mills, Derbyshire, stealing £7,000 from fruit machines and causing £5,840 worth of damage.

During his spree between March 2013 and May last year, Cassidy (shown in CCTV) targeted five pubs in Manchester and one in Derbyshire, stealing £7,000 from fruit machines and causing £5,840 worth of damage

Among those pubs targeted were The Hinds Head, The Wilfred Wood and The Moor Top in Stockport, The Famous Trevor Arms in Chorlton and The Sidings in Levenshulme, Manchester.

Cassidy, of Stockport, was sentenced at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court to four-and-a-half years in prison today after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing to burglary.

The court heard how he would use his belly to slither along the floors of various pubs to get to the gambling machines. 

After staking out each pub to assess the alarm system, Cassidy - occasionally with an accomplice - would cover the CCTV cameras of the targeted premises with plastic bags before returning at night.

He would then either completely remove windows with a crowbar or smash through so he could enter and wriggle his way across the floor to the fruit machines.

He had realised that if he remained below the 'line of sight' of burglar alarm beams that he could remain undetected.

Cassidy was eventually caught when police spoke to his girlfriend Cheryl O'Donnell and she admitted he would leave the house carrying a rucksack and tools and return with a large amount of coins.

When he poured out £1,000 in coins in front of her, he told her to tell police that 'it was her savings' if they asked about it.

Phillip Barnes, prosecuting, said: 'The aim of the burglaries was to target fruit machines, which were typically forced open and emptied of cash.

'The burglaries were in the early morning when the public houses themselves were less likely to be occupied and the machines more likely to be full.

'In the majority of the cases, although the public areas were empty, the homes above, within the same buildings, were occupied by the landlords or tenants.

'The offender or offenders would be seen to be wearing gloves and face coverings of various sorts and carrying bags.

'On a number of occasions CCTV cameras were covered with bags in advance.

Cassidy (pictured), had already clocked up 181 previous convictions when he carried out the nine raids. He was sentenced at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court to a four-and-a-half year prison sentence today

'The modus operandi involved crawling or sliding through pubs below the 'line of sight' of alarm system beams and then turning machines to shield the thief from the beam picking him up and triggering the alarm.'

One pub, the Wilfred Wood, near Stockport, was burgled on three separate occasions.

During the first raid on November 11 2013, Cassidy was caught on CCTV climbing a drainpipe and covering the CCTV camera with a plastic bag.

The window frame was then removed from the back door and, while an accomplice waited outside, Cassidy crawled around all three fruit machines and broke into them. He also attempted to steal alcohol from behind the bar which set the alarm off at 5.30am.

Following an hour in the pub, Cassidy made off with £1,100 and caused £280 of damage. 

He later targeted the Queens Head in New Mill, Derbyshire, where more than £400 was stolen from a fruit machine. He was later chased by police during his getaway.

Mr Barnes said: 'Two males were seen walking to the train station and boarding the train at around 6am, one being this defendant.

'The train from New Mills to Manchester was stopped by British Transport Police but Cassidy pulled the emergency cord and managed to escape. 

'Recovered on the train in a bag was brandy, charity sweets, £21 from the charity box, crisps and around £350 in cash from the fruit machine as well as tools and gloves.'

Mr Barnes added that the morning after each burglary Cassidy would deposit large amounts of money into his NatWest bank account in Manchester city centre - via a machine used for counting large quantities of coins and change.

In a statement read to the court, Steven Clough, the landlord of the Wilfred Wood pub, said he felt 'frustrated, angry and victimised'.

'I felt helpless that he kept doing this,' he added.

Sandra Booth, the landlady of The Sidings in Levenshulme, Manchester, said: 'I'm angry, upset and frustrated. Angry that he feels it is okay to break into our home like this. 

'We now have extra security and we're so upset the charity box was stolen. This type of crime is the lowest of the low.'

In mitigation, defence counsel Paul Bryning said: 'There is no trauma to any victims beyond the inevitable.

'Overall there is limited damage and disturbance. Perhaps it is no surprise to learn he has a history of addiction to Class A drugs. The addiction stems from issues from his childhood in the care system.'

The court heard how the serial burglar had already clocked up 181 previous convictions. He first got into trouble at the age of 11 and was first locked up at the age of 14.

Sentencing Cassidy, the judge Mr Recorder Graham Smith said: 'The burglaries follow a very general and specific pattern. You target the place in the early hours of the morning with relatively sophisticated planning to obscure the CCTV cameras, then either break or remove from the window the glass and slide across the floor to avoid detection.

Sandra Booth, landlady of The Sidings in Levenshulme, Manchester (pictured) said she was 'angry, upset and frustrated' that Cassidy had broken into her premises and stolen cash from the fruit machine and charity tin

'You then move the fruit machine to deflect the security beam and take the contents of the machine, and it seems, on other occasions, you have taken items including alcohol, crisps, sweets and small items of cash from charity or staff tips.

'You acknowledge that what you have done is completely wrong and you know you will be sent to prison. I do have regard to your difficult childhood which has led to a cycle of behaviour which has been described as "self-sabotaging".

'I know from experience in this court and outside that it is possible to break free from this behaviour even while in prison and there are signs of encouragement.

'Before this period you went for over one year without offending which may not sound a long time but given your background that was significant.

'I urge you to take every opportunity available to you to see if you can break free.'

Following the sentencing, detective constable Adele Coulter said: 'Thankfully, we received information he had been involved in a burglary using the same tactic and we managed to link him with the remaining crimes.

'Cassidy thought he was being clever and was getting away with it but it goes to show that crime does not pay and you will be brought to justice eventually.'
