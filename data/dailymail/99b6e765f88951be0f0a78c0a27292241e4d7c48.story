Employees using their cell phones at work has topped a list of what their bosses consider the biggest productivity killers in the workplace.

Fifty percent of employers surveyed nationally named cell phones and texting as the main bad habits getting in the way of work getting done, while good old fashioned office gossip was their second biggest bugbear.

According to the survey, 24 percent of employers list ‘noisy co-workers’ as an obstacle to productivity, while another 23 percent say coworkers stopping by each other’s work spaces are to blame.

The national survey was commissioned by recruiters CareerBuilder, and they quizzed employees across a range of industries as well as bosses.

Unsurprisingly, employees agreed that the personal use of technology is one of the leading culprits behind unproductive activity at work. 

One in four workers (24 percent) admitted that, during a typical workday, they will spend at least one hour a day on personal calls, emails or texts.

Twenty-one percent estimated that they spend one hour or more during a typical workday visiting non-work related websites.

Behaviors of co-workers, meetings and other factors are also creating obstacles to maximizing performance.

‘While many managers feel their teams perform at a desirable level, they also warn that little distractions can add up to bigger gaps in productivity,’ said CareerBuilder’s Rosemary Haefner.

‘It's important to be organized and designate times to work on different deliverables. Minimize interruptions and save personal communications for your lunch hour or break. It can help put more time and momentum back into your workday.’

The study also highlights some of the strangest things employers have caught employees doing while on the clock.
