Not since Elton John rocked up has Shrewsbury Town’s Greenhous Meadow stadium been braced for such packed stands.

The visit of Chelsea has seen an extra 486 temporary seats installed, thanks to financial assistance from sponsors Capital One, to push the expected attendance over the five-figure mark, double the usual. There were 16,000 scattering on to the pitch when Sir Elton played in 2011.

It is an exciting evening ahead for the people of this Shropshire town but not many believe their League Two team will still be standing after Jose Mourinho’s Premier League leaders are done.

The numbers tell much of the story. Shrewsbury’s annual wage bill is understood to be £1.4million, more than 125 times smaller than their visitors’, which stands at £176m. Eden Hazard’s new £200,000-a-week contract would see him earn as much in seven days as manager Micky Mellon’s entire squad in two months.

But after claiming the scalps of Blackpool, Leicester, and Norwich already in this competition, Shrewsbury want more.

‘We aren’t here to clap people on to the pitch,’ says Mellon, holding court in a neat suite of the ground opened in July 2007. ‘We’re going to try and knock them out. We know the task is massive but we want to reach the quarter-finals.’ 

Mellon, the 42-year-old hailing from Paisley, was part of the Blackpool side which stunned Chelsea in September 1996, winning 3-1 in the League Cup at Stamford Bridge but going out on aggregate.

‘In every game of football, you always have a chance,’ he adds. ‘Of course, it’s ridiculous how much bigger their chance is. But while we’re still in the game, we’ll keep believing. There are certain areas of the pitch that have to be absolutely on the money.’

How many of Mourinho’s stars will turn out remains to be seen, especially given it will be only 48 hours since the match at Old Trafford, but seasoned internationals should still flood their line-up. The Shrewsbury players they face will have cost next to nothing.

Striker James Collins, signed for a nominal fee from Hibernian this summer, is the only one not brought in on a free. Liam Lawrence, recently recovered from injury, is the most recognisable name. The 32-year-old former Stoke and Sunderland midfielder joined because Mellon likes to play his football on the floor and the facilities are above the norm for League Two. Chelsea should be pleased at the standards that await on and off the pitch.

The manager has knitted together a squad with 16 new faces by insisting on breakfasts together in pre-season and ensuring every player speaks their mind. ‘We need leaders in our team,’ he says.

The Capital One Cup trophy was at the stadium on Monday and caught the eye of local schoolchildren at the training ground earlier in the afternoon. ‘They all came sprinting over, touching it, kissing it,’ adds Mellon, hoping this can provide a catalyst. ‘The spotlight being on us will be great to keep moving us forward.’

If Chelsea are ahead, is there a chance Mourinho offers an early handshake? ‘I’d be disappointed if he never shook my hand,’ says Mellon. ‘I’d see that as a bigger sign of disrespect. It may upset Roy Keane but it doesn’t bother me. If we’re winning maybe I’ll give him a big cuddle.’

Asked to suggest his own title given he will face The Special One, Mellon quips: ‘The Special Brew.’ That is in reference to a new ale made by a local brewery specially for the match: Wood’s Blue & Amber.

Mellon warmly greets fan Lloyd Burton, an 11-year-old cancer sufferer who is in a wheelchair after arduous treatment on his brain tumour. Lloyd has worked on a paint-by-numbers portrait of Mourinho and will meet the Chelsea manager before the match so he can sign the picture.

Decked out in Shrewsbury kit and bobble hat, Lloyd will be cheering on his team, alongside 10,000 others eager for an upset.
