The all-you-can-eat buffet has long been a dieter’s worst nightmare, but now researchers believe they have found the key to staying slim.

Dr Brian Wansink, of Cornell University, in New York, believes dieters should take a small plate and then look at everything on offer before choosing what they want.

He noticed that there are plenty of slim people at all-you-can-eat buffets so he decided to observe how they behaved in this situation.

He sent 30 observers to watch 300 people at 22 all-you-can-eat Chinese buffets across America.

According to HealthDay, these observers estimated people’s Body Mass Index and then watched how they behaved around the food.

This included noting where they sat in relation to the buffet, whether they used forks or chopsticks, and how many times they went up for more food.

Dr Wansink told the website: ‘Skinny people are more likely to scout out the food. They're more likely to look at the different alternatives before they pounce on something.

‘Heavy people just tend to pick up a plate and look at each item and say, “Do I want it? Yes or no”.’

Slim diners are seven times more likely to take a small plate than larger ones are

The observers also found that slim diners were seven times more likely to take a small plate than larger ones were.

They also noted that larger people sat, on average, 16 feet closer to the buffet than thin people and that they chewed their food for less time.

‘The interesting thing was that almost all of these changes were unconscious to the person making them,’ said Dr Wansink. ‘They essentially become habits over time.’

The news comes after it was revealed that, thanks to huge portion sizes and the prevalence of all-you-can-eat buffets, the average Briton gains 8lb in weight during a two week holiday to America.
