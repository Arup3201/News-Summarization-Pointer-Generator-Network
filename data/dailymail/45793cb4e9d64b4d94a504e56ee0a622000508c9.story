Kurt Flood, 24, was charged with murder, assault, endangering children and evidence tampering

A man suspected of killing a one-year-old because he believed beating the boy was the only way to rid him of demons was charged with murder after the toddler's mother agreed to cooperate.

Maryland boy Cameron Beckford was found dead inside a backpack on December 31 in Big Walnut Creek in Columbus, Ohio, after being fatally injured on Christmas by Kurt Flood.

Flood, 24, was also was indicted on charges of felonious assault, endangering children, evidence tampering and abuse of a corpse after Beckford's mother opted to cooperate with prosecutors.

Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien said authorities believe Flood was the person who assaulted Beckford but his mother, Dainesha Stevens, is responsible for not intervening.

Stevens initially told police she left her son on a stranger's porch.

She later changed her story and pointed authorities to the creek, where they found the body on New Year's Eve.

Stevens had left Frederick, Maryland, in mid-December and stayed with Flood in Columbus.

When Stevens found the boy unresponsive after the Christmas beating, she and Flood put his body in the backpack and left it in the creek nearby, prosecutors and Stevens' attorney said.

The toddler had bruises on his lower back, kidneys and lungs, and bruises and scarring on his buttocks, according to the county coroner.
