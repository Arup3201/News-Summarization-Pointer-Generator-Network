A white supremacist cop killer with a tattooed-covered face has lost his right to an attorney because he has repeatedly threatened them and called them 'clowns', according to court documents.

Curtis Allgier also told his legal representatives preparing his appeal that they did not have the honor of being in his 'Aryan GOD presence' and claimed that he 'knows to find people outside of prison'. 

The 35-year-old was an inmate at Utah State Prison when he murdered prison guard Stephen Anderson after escaping from shackles during a doctors appointment in 2007.

The 60-year-old corrections officer was escorting the prisoner into an MRI at a a University of Utah medical clinic when Allgier got hold of his gun and shot him. 

He then fled on foot and stole a vehicle before leading police on a highway chase at speeds exceeding 100 mph, but he was caught in a fast food store 45 minutes later.

Allgier is now appealing a plea deal he accepted which spared him the death penalty, but his behavior means he will be on his own for the duration of the case. 

In complaints obtained by Fox 13, Allgier referred to his lawyers as the 'dumbest a** clowns I've ever had the EXTREME dishonorable displeasure of being forced to know' and threatened them by saying he 'knew people' on the outside. 

The killer added he was 'incompetently and ineffectively misrepresented' and that they would never have 'the honor of being in my Aryan GOD presence or having any kind of contact with me period'. 

The Utah Supreme Court admitted that forfeiting a  right to an attorney is 'an extreme measure.'

However they justified the decision by saying: 'We conclude that making threats to the welfare of appointed counsel may constitute extreme conduct justifying a forfeiture of counsel.'

Allgier will have to represent himself for the remainder of his appeal. 

He pleaded no contest in October 2012 to aggravated murder, pleading guilty to additional charges of disarming a peace officer, aggravated escape, aggravated robbery and possession of a firearm by a restricted person. 

Adding to the layers of Allgier's personal profile, the supposed racist was due to marry Erica Herrera, a half-Hispanic woman, in August though it is unclear whether or not that happened.

'He's a very sweet, loving... He's a really kind-hearted, good person,' she said.

Third District Judge Paul Maughan opened the sentencing hearing to family members of Anderson, a 22-year employee of the Utah Department of Corrections.

The 60-year-old victim was survived by a wife, five adult children and 18 grandchildren.
