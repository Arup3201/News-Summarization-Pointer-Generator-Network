Agnieszka Radwanska's charge through the draw came to a shocking end on Monday night, with the fourth seed crushed by Ekaterina Makarova in less than an hour.

The Pole had conceded only nine games - and not a single set - going into her fourth-round match against the 22nd seed.

But she was demolished either side of rain delays, going down 6-3, 6-0 in just 53 minutes.

It was a stunning defeat for a woman who has reached the final and semi-finals here in her past two visits. She was broken twice in the first set, before a terrible second set in which she won only four points off her own serve.

When Radwanska had break points, two of them, both in the second set, she failed to convert. Makarova had eight and took five — decisive and devastating.

The Russian, who had never previously gone past the third round at Wimbledon, was relentless, hitting 24 winners and making only six unforced errors as another big name was knocked out.

Of the top four, only third seed Simona Halep, who plays Zarina Diyas in the fourth round today, remains in the draw.

Makarova, 26, is paired with Lucie Safarova, the 23rd seed from the Czech Republic, who made light work of qualifier Tereza Smitkova.

She said: ‘I am very comfortable this year. My parents are over here with me and we are all staying in the same house. It is like I am at home, eating Russian food that my mum cooks. I feel very good.’

Day to remember: Makarova hit 24 winners and only made six unforced errors
