Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn believes drastic changes need to be made to address the financial folly that has led to the demise of two Formula One teams over the past week.

Kaltenborn has long expressed concern at the escalating costs in F1, with organisations such as Ferrari, Red Bull, Mercedes and McLaren operating on budgets of £200-300million per year.

Unable to adequately compete, back-of-the-grid marques Marussia and Caterham have entered into administration, and the belief is they are unlikely to be seen in F1 again.

The soaring financial implications of competing in F1 have resulted in Sauber's future being placed in doubt, although Kaltenborn claims that whilst precarious, her team's position is not as bad as Caterham and Marussia.

Kaltenborn is, however, angered by what has occurred, particularly as the teams had the opportunity at the start of the year to address the situation, only to reject FIA president Jean Todt's plans for a cost cap from 2015 onwards.

'I'm beyond the stage of frustration,' said Kaltenborn.

'It's one thing to just talk about this terrible scenario that some teams are not going to be there, but for the people responsible for the sport to have let it come this far is extremely disturbing.

'What we really need to look at - and we as a team have been saying for so long - is to get the figures right in the sport.

'It's a real shame we have turnovers of billions of dollars, yet as a sport, as a community, we are not capable of making sure that 11 teams survive. Now you try to explain that to somebody.'

In particular, Kaltenborn has called for a re-think as to how money is distributed amongst the teams.

At present, given various agreements and deals between the teams and F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, what a marque such as Ferrari receive in revenue outstrips that of Marussia and Caterham four fold.

'There should be a certain amount that allows each and every team to at least live decently," added Kaltenborn.

'No-one is saying you should have the most luxurious standards. We should be allowed to participate in the sport.

'We have put in so much investment in order to reach this level, and that should be respected whereby you get a certain basic amount that is the same for everyone.

'And given the brands, already so established, a team like Ferrari will attract different sponsors and amounts than ourselves.

'But at least an environment has been created whereby a smaller team does not have to suffer that much.

Referring to one of Ecclestone's oft-repeated comments, Kaltenborn said: 'It's pretty outdated to say if you don't have the money then don't be in the sport.

'Even small teams are putting a lot of money into the sport - at least for normal people it's a lot of money.'

Another issue is the self-interest of the larger teams, who possess power that allows them to go against the seemingly greater good of F1.

Kaltenborn feels if the teams could be united then the sport would benefit, thrive and attract new marques and sponsors.

'As teams we should first find this collective which is not there at the moment. That made us strong in the past,' said Kaltenborn.

'We all have at least one common denominator which is to survive in this sport and make the sport something healthy, because we all will attract our sponsors.

'Like it used to be in the past and not too long ago, you had the big ones, the medium teams, the smaller teams and they all attracted very good brands.

'You could attract them because the product was so good, because people wanted to come into the sport, and not everybody can go to the top three.

'That's what we first should focus on before we start pointing here and there.'
