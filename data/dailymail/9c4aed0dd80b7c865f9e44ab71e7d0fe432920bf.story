England skipper Chris Robshaw led his side on the captain's run at Twickenham on Friday as the Red Rose put the finishing touches to their preparations for South Africa.

Stuart Lancaster's men face the Springboks at HQ on Saturday having succumbed to a 24-21 defeat to New Zealand last weekend but England looked focused and determined in training.

Anthony Watson, the Bath wing who will make his full debut against South Africa, and Marland Yarde, who returns to the bench after injury, both looked fit and ready to get going during the session.
