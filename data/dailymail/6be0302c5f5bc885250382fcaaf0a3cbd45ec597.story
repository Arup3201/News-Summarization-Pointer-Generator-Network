Maria Sharapova recovered from a slow start to defeat fellow Russian Maria Kirilenko and reach the second round of the US Open.

It was a potentially tough draw for Sharapova given Kirilenko was ranked in the top 10 last year before injury problems struck.

She did not play for the first three months of this season and has won only two matches all year, tumbling to 113th in the rankings.

Comfortably through: Maria Sharapova waves to the fans after defeating fellow Russian Maria Kirilenko 6-4 6-0 in the first round of the US Open in New York

Momentum: Sharapova took 10 games in succession against her opponent to ensure the victory

Power play: French Open champion Sharapova returns to Kirilenko during the match at Arthur Ashe Stadium

But for six games Kirilenko more than matched Sharapova, breaking the fifth seed's serve for 3-2 and then holding her own.

Kirilenko was the last player to beat Sharapova in the opening round of a grand slam at the Australian Open in 2010.

She was quickly pegged back this time, though, Sharapova recovering to 4-4 and then breaking serve again to take the opening set.

Try as hard as she might, Kirilenko simply could not stem the run of games against her and by the end of a 6-4 6-0 victory, Sharapova had racked up 10 in a row.

Struggles: Kirilenko required lengthy treatment to her left ankle during the match

Freefall: Kirilenko, in the top 10 last year, has suffered injury problems and is now ranked No 113

To compound Kirilenko's misery, she also needed lengthy treatment to her left ankle.

The pair, who are both 27, have known each other since they were juniors and Sharapova said: 'It's always tough.

'I played a tough opponent who is capable of playing really good tennis so it was a tough first round for me. I'm happy I stepped it up and I was able to finish really strong.

'She's been injured throughout the year so it's great to see her out here competing.'

Next up: Sharapova will take on Romania's Alexandra Dulgheru in the second round

Sharapova missed the US Open last year because of a shoulder injury and was thrilled to be back under the lights on Arthur Ashe Stadium.

'It was tough missing this court last year,' she said. 'I spent a few weeks in New York during the tournament. I couldn't follow the tennis, I was a little bit too sad.'

The French Open champion next meets Romania's Alexandra Dulgheru.
