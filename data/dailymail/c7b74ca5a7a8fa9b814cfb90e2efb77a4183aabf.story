For some of us, forcing down the odd brussel sprout is as far as it goes when it comes to festive cuisine.

But some supermarkets and restaurants are determined to tickle your taste buds this December.

Various festive favourites have experienced something of a mash-up this year with sweet meeting savoury and desserts turning to liquids one thing is for sure this is not your average Christmas feast.

So if you are looking to experiment a little this festive season follow our guide to 2014's most bizarre festive foods. Knives and forks at the ready, if you dare...

Christmas on a pizza: A new £13 pizza from a Mayfair-based restaurant has been created and is layered with pulled turkey, pigs-in-blankets, chestnut stuffing and all the trimmings

CHRISTMAS PUDDING PIZZA

If you have a penchant for pizza and festive food then you'll love the latest addition to a trendy London restaurant's menu.

Mayfair Pizza Co. has unveiled a Christmas Pudding Pizza, which is served flaming at the table and made with Christmas pudding, custard brandy and redcurrant compote.

If you have less of a sweet tooth and want to opt for something savoury, perhaps the Christmas Dinner Pizza is more to your taste.

Laden with pulled turkey, pigs-in-blankets, chestnut stuffing, roast potatoes, root vegetables, redcurrant compote and bread sauce, this £13 pizza is all the flavours of the full feast on a plate of dough. 

Sweet treat? Mayfair Pizza Co. has unveiled a Christmas Pudding Pizza, which is served flaming, as pictured, and made with Christmas pudding, custard brandy and redcurrant compote

These aren't the first quirky pizzas created by the eatery. Last year they unveiled the sweet pizza menu, which included delights such as a chocolate calzone, as well as bloody pizzas inspired by the famous hangover healer. 

Michael Lecouteur, executive chef at Mayfair Pizza Co says that for him a festive pizza was an obvious direction to go in. 

'I was thinking about ideas for the new winter menu at Mayfair Pizza Co. and wondered whether they fitted the brief I had been given. The Christmas Dinner Pizza was a no-brainer as it's very British, very seasonal – exactly what I know best! 

'The flavours marry together very well, just in a different guise as to what you'd normally expect. And Christmas Pudding Pizza was a bit more "out there". But after doing white chocolate and strawberry in our famous sweet pizzas, it kind of fitted in well…' 

Tesco have added a Turkey and Stuffing flavour to their Weirdoughs savoury doughnut range 

WEIRD-DOUGHS

Iceland have also partaken in the savoury doughnut trend offering a range of duck and hoisin sauce flavoured treats as part of their frozen party food range 

When it comes to doughnuts there are few combinations that haven't been tackled with Krispy Kreme serving up a mincemeat treat each December. 

So it was only a matter of time before savoury takes on the snack hit the shelves.

Tesco are the true pioneers in this area with their range of 'weirdoughs' including a smoky bacon and cheese and onion flavour. 

And now the supermarket giant has added a festive take to the range with their Turkey and Stuffing flavour. 

Priced at £1 for ten mini doughnuts reviewers have compared them to 'the real thing' adding that the doughy consistency helps make it more true to life.

And Tesco aren't the only supermarket jumping on board the bizarre dough trend. Iceland have added a range of savoury doughnuts to their frozen party food range.

The Duck in Doughnuts  contains a variety of savoury duck filled doughnuts with various crunchy toppings. 

BIZARRE BOOZE 

As well as party food taking an unusual turn party drink has also taken on a strange identity this season.

Marks and Spencer, who are often viewed as the go-to supermarket for a Christmas party, have this year unveiled a Christmas Cake Liqueur. Described by the retailer as the 'taste of the festive season in a glass' and mimicking the cake's rich and fruity flavour it is set to be a big hit in stores.

Sainsbury's has teamed up with JJ Goodman in order to create a mincemeat cocktail in response to the record sales of mince pies since September 

Sainsbury's has also partaken in the pudding punch trend. The supermarket has teamed up with London Cocktail Club owner JJ Goodman to create an unusual mincemeat cocktail for Brits to make at home in response to an increased appetite for mince pies – Sainsbury's has sold more than 8 million since September (for the full recipe see below.)

Ingredients 

Method 

Apart from the clementine, add all of the ingredients to a cocktail shaker filled with ice. Shake vigorously for ten seconds to allow for some of the dilution and to properly chill the drink. Then strain the cocktail into a martini glass or a short glass filled with cubed ice.

Take a clementine or orange and a potato peeler, zest a strip of peel 3cm wide and 6cm or so long. Twist the peel over the glass orange side down to spray the oils over the drink, which will give you an amazing smell as you sip.

SPROUT SNACKS

For those of us who are partial to the seasonal greens Marks and Spencer are offering a range of unusual food and drink this December to satisfy your sprout cravings.

The supermarket has combined the much-maligned vegetable with apple and pear for a sweet and tasty drink that adds a healthy element to the usual festive binge.

The juice adds up to two of the five daily portions of fruit and vegetables that are recommended for a healthy diet.

M&S are also offering a sprout coleslaw  said to be the perfect filler for boxing day turkey sandwiches.

RAVENOUS FOR RUDOLPH? 

The festive feast has taken a rather literal turn in budget supermarket Lidl with the store adding reindeer to their Christmas food offerings for 2014.  

Following the success of their Reindeer steaks, the store anticipates that customers are ready for the meat in its raw form with reindeer carpaccio to feature among the luxury delicacies  this Christmas.

Packs of the thinly sliced raw meat will feature in the 'Deluxe' range that the thriving German chain hopes will draw in shoppers who would normally go to the other major retailers. 

Perhaps not the most family friendly choice for Christmas dinner but it is bound to be a talking point at any festive table.
