As the pheasant shooting season gets into full swing at Sandringham, there is growing concern about a fresh outbreak of a sickness which has struck down dogs walked in woodland on the Queen’s Norfolk estate.

At least a dozen pets have been hit by seasonal canine illness (SCI) in recent weeks after being exercised there.

The news is a blow for the Queen, who thought her woods were in the clear after a previous outbreak.

She has authorised a new study by the Animal Health Trust charity to try to identify the cause of the illness, which has been blamed on harvest mite larvae.

The charity has arranged for dog owners visiting Sandringham to get free doses of an anti-mite spray which they can apply to their pets directly before walking in the woods.

In return, owners will have to take part in a survey to see if their pets suffered any sign of sickness after being walked on the estate.

The trust hopes that if all dogs that receive the treatment escape unscathed, then it will provide definitive proof that SCI is caused by harvest mites.

The pilot project is being carried out only at Sandringham which was first hit by the illness three years ago. 

Blow: The news that the sickness bug has returned will be a blow to the Queen

Royal shooting parties are as much at risk as casual dog walkers. SCI affected 22 dogs at Sandringham last year; the previous year there were 51 cases and three deaths; and in 2010 there were 35 cases and six deaths.

The survival rates are thought to have improved due to publicity raising awareness of the illness and the Sandringham estate putting up signs warning dog owners to watch out for symptoms.

Natural History Museum botanist Dr Mark Spencer suffered an infestation of harvest mite bites on his leg after walking through undergrowth while examining woodland at Sandringham in 2011.

Buckingham Palace has refused to confirm or deny if the Queen has stopped exercising her beloved corgis at Sandringham because of the illness.

It is thought that royal shooting parties which use Labradors to retrieve pheasants have continued as normal.

It’s enough to have the ladies reaching for the smelling salts — apparently Boris Johnson’s trademark rumpled appearance owes more to art than nature.

That at least is the view of Have I Got News For You’s Paul Merton. The comic says of the London Mayor: ‘He’s a very shrewd man who realises that no one fears the buffoon.’

Of Johnson’s appearances on the quiz show, Merton adds: ‘He’d leave make-up with his hair meticulously combed, disappear round the back of the set and then walk on with his hair all over the place. I think he has a mirror in his pocket to make sure that it’s always attractively tousled.’

As the father of two young children, Mayfair gallery owner Tim Jefferies has had to make some adjustments in his life.

Now another change is underway — his gorgeous Swedish wife Malin has given up modelling to be a stay-at-home mother.

And Tim is delighted. ‘I’m glad she’s done it, but it was her decision,’ he tells me at the PAD Arts fair in Berkeley Square.

‘We have two children and she wants to concentrate on that.’

Jefferies, 51, has been linked to a string of beauties including Koo Stark, Claudia Schiffer, Kylie Minogue and Sophie Dahl. He met Malin, 37, on a blind date in 2006 and they married two years later. Coco, four, arrived the following year and Rex is almost two.

‘Coming home to a calm family life after some of the different sort of people I have to meet  is absolutely peachy,’ says Tim, who lives in Holland Park.  ‘Would I like more children? You bet. Having children has changed my life. I’ve never been so happy.’

Hollywood star Robert Redford’s film-maker son James is planning to spend time in Britain researching his family’s roots.

‘My quest into our family tree started after a trip to Scotland,’ James tells me at the launch of his documentary The Big  Picture: Rethinking Dyslexia — inspired by the struggles of his son, Dylan, 22.

‘I was amazed to see lots of red-haired people walking around who looked just like me and Dad! It was weird.’

James has already discovered a British ancestor called Charles.

‘He was a musician, so showbusiness must run in the blood,’ he says.

Deep thinker: Even though Roy Hodgson has a busy schedule, he still found time to wish his friend a speedy recovery

England football manager Roy Hodgson had much on his mind yesterday, not least how his team would fare in the vital World Cup qualifying match against Poland at Wembley

But he still found time to text his friend, playwright Sir Ronald Harwood, wishing him a speedy recovery from a recent heart attack.

‘Roy lives in Richmond and often comes to see my plays when they are put on in the town’s theatre,’ says Harwood, who found fame with The Dresser and received an Oscar for  The Pianist.

‘He’s a lovely man and not at all like the image some people have of football folk.

‘A deep thinker, interested in society, history and world affairs.

'It’s typical of him to remember me at the most important moment in English football history for quite a while.’

In football speak, Sir Ronnie was ‘over the moon’ to get Roy’s text as he dined in a Chelsea restaurant.

He’s given up one country pile — famously dubbed Beckingham Palace — and is renting a £20 million house in West London.

But apparently David Beckham has been casting his eye over another mansion, Great Durnford Manor in Wiltshire, former home of Prince Charles’s pal, Lord Tryon.

It’s on the market at £18 million and comes with river frontage and a partridge shoot. But it does have some unhappy memories.

Tryon sold the place after the death of his ex-wife Kanga, Charles’s confidante and lover, who died at 49, having never recovered from falling out of the window of a drugs clinic.
