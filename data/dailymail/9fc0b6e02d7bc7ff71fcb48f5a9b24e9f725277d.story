Fairytale princess: Emma Kirby, 24, dresses as Rapunzel, Tinkerbell, Sleeping Beauty or Queen Elsa from Disney's newest hit Frozen

She recently brought a Tube train to a standstill when an excited child spotted her and shouted 'Queen Elsa' before encouraging the whole carriage to sing the epic ballad 'Let It Go'.

Princess Emma, who lives  in Battersea, London, spends thousands of pounds on outfits and accessories to make herself look just like the well known Disney characters.

Emma says: 'I live in a fairy tale world most of the time and I love it.

'It's great to feel so magical and special-ever since I was a little girl I've wanted to be a princess when I grow up.

Emma's love for all things Disney first began aged just three-years-old when she went on a holiday to Disney World, Florida, with her family.

'It all seemed so magical and since then I've wondered why people would live in the real world when they can live in a fairy tale,' she added.

Despite working in events Emma has recently set up her own business named Once Upon A Time Parties London, to make all her childhood dreams come true and is set to go full time next month.

She earns up to £170 every two hours and sings songs from Disney films, plays musical instruments and acts the perfect princess for groups of up to 30 children.

'I just want
 to give these children amazing memories. I love all the Disney story 
lines and even at my age I am still in love with all the films.

'I get a lot of funny looks from people but kids always come and say hello and wave at me. It's adorable.'I'm just such a happy person so I love 
making the children happy.  It's a form of escapism for me and the 
children genuinely believe I'm from a Disney film.

Her diary is so full of bookings Emma even admits she spends so much time pretending, Frozen's Queen Elsa has become her alter-ego.

Emma added: 
'A child once tripped over something because she was looking at me. She 
started crying and to cheer her up I gave her my princess tiara.

'If I can bring a bit of sparkle and magic to a little one's day it fills my heart with joy.'

She splashes out more than £1,500 on handmade outfits to magic herself into jaw-dropping princesses, including Beauty and the Beast's Bell, and Sleeping Beauty's Aurora.

And the princess even has her own Prince Charming in the form of boyfriend of three years, Jazz.

The couple often snuggle up on the sofa and watch their favourite childhood films, although Emma confessed she struggles to get the policeman into his own costume.

'I am so lucky because Jazz loves Disney too. He's always telling me how proud of me he is and he thinks what I do is great.

'He showers me with compliments and says I look really pretty in the costumes. He really is my Prince Charming, although I'm not sure I could get him into a costume!'
