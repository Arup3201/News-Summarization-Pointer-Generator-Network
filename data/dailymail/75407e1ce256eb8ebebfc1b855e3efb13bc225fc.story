The inquiry into Nigel Evans launched after a fellow Tory MP accompanied the alleged victim to a police station

The inquiry into claims of rape against Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans was launched after a fellow Tory MP accompanied an alleged victim to a police station, it has been claimed.

Mr Evans, MP for Ribble Valley, was arrested earlier this month over allegations that he had raped one man and subjected another to a sexual assault.

He vigorously denies the claims and has refused to stand down as deputy to Commons Speaker John Bercow.

The arrest caused a sensation in Westminster, but the claim that it came about thanks to the intervention of a fellow Conservative is even more of a bombshell.

The MP who apparently accompanied the young man to the police station told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It is important for legal reasons that I make absolutely no comment.’

Mr Evans says the allegations, which date from 2009 to last month, are ‘completely false’.

He has not yet been charged with any offence and has been bailed until June 19.

He has temporarily stepped aside from his duties as Deputy Speaker, but says he intends to return to the chair of the chamber after the debates on the Queen’s Speech.

The MP has confirmed that in 2009 he was interviewed by the then Tory chief whip Patrick McLoughlin over allegedly making an unwanted advance to a man, but has said it was a ‘misreading of signals’.

A spokesman for Lancashire Police said: ‘We are speaking to a number of people in connection with this investigation, but as this is an ongoing criminal inquiry we will not be providing any further detail.’
