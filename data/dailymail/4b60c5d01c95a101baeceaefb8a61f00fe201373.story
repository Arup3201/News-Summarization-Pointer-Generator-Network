America’s Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson cut a despondent figure on Friday as he offered a downbeat assessment of his team of crocks.

‘We are dropping like flies, we really are,’ he said.

Just over a month to the match at Gleneagles, and it is looking like the Americans will need a hospital ward rather than a team room.

Dustin Johnson is definitely out as he tries to put his life back together. Tiger Woods, with his myriad of fitness issues, is a sad caricature of the player who ruled the world.

Preparing for a storm: Tom Watson knows that his USA team will be underdogs without so many of their stars

Hurting: The one-great champion admits his physical condition is nowhere near where it needs to be

Jason Dufner’s sad defence of the US PGA Championship ended painfully after just eight holes on Thursday and he is adamant that he will not be seen anywhere near a golf course again until he sorts out two bulging discs in his neck.

World No6 Matt Kuchar, the highest-rated American in the world rankings, is another who did not make the starting line-up at Valhalla because of a bad back.

Just to put the tin lid on matters, Steve Stricker, who has been selected as a vice-captain but could still make the team, judging by his fine play at this tournament, is fighting a sore hip.

Down and out: Dustin Johnson will also miss the Ryder Cup as he takes time away from the golf course

Indeed, the only man who looks fully fit is the captain himself, still sprightly at 64.

For a proud man like Watson, of course, it is no laughing matter.

‘I’ll be honest, it’s anyone’s guess who will be playing for us right now,’ he said.

The only certainty is that the beleaguered Americans will start as massive underdogs at the Perthshire course on September 26 to 28.
