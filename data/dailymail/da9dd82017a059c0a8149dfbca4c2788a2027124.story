Kenyan police last night agreed to set up a task force to investigate the death of British aristocrat’s son Alexander Monson after protests from his family and allegations of a cover-up.

Alexander, 28, died in mysterious circumstances after spending nine hours in a police cell following his arrest for smoking cannabis outside a bar near his mother’s home in the coastal resort of Diani, south of Mombasa.

Yesterday, his friends gathered for a memorial service in the family garden overlooking a beach at the edge of the Indian Ocean.

His father Nicholas, the 12th Baron of Monson, in his eulogy described Alexander as ‘a brilliant comet that blazed through the skies for 28 years’.

Following the service, his family had intended for the former Marlborough College pupil's body to be cremated, although it was still unclear if this would be possible due to the likelihood of further autopsies.

His family believes his life could have been saved if police had called for medical help when he collapsed last Saturday morning.

Instead they allegedly took him to hospital and handcuffed him unconscious to a bed, telling doctors to treat him for a drugs overdose.

His family, headed by Alexander’s father, has instructed lawyers to  carry out an independent inquiry  with a view to taking action against the police.

A post-mortem examination carried out last week showed Alexander died from the result of ‘blunt force trauma’ – a blow to the head that led to swelling of the brain.

His left hand was heavily bruised, leading pathologists to believe he may have been trying to defend himself, and there was bruising to his groin that suggests he had been kicked.

Police had initially claimed the public schoolboy had suffered fatal complications relating to drug use after he was held under suspicion of smoking Bhang, a local variety of cannabis.

Lord Monson, who travelled to Mombasa for his son’s funeral, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Whatever happened in that police station need not have led to Alexander’s death. It is clear he was attacked and we want this properly investigated.

‘His death is a terrible tragedy and a waste. However painful it is for us at this time, we are determined to find the truth and bring those responsible to justice.’

Monson also spoke of his devastation he felt after first hearing of his son's death: 'I was on holiday in Spain and I was playing a game of Scrabble when a friend rang me up and said: 'I have some appalling news to tell you: Alexander has died in hospital.

'As you can imagine I just couldn't believe it - I was in a state of shock.

'Then, when I arrived in Kenya, it was revealed to me that he had died from a blow to the head.

'Again, that was another great wave of shock.'

Last night, the head of Mombasa’s Provincial Criminal Investigation Office, Ambrose Munyasia, said: ‘I am appointing senior officers to a special task force which will hold a thorough inquiry. A person has died in the arms of the police and we must investigate his death.’

A family spokesman said: ‘Everything points to an attack followed by  a cover-up.’
