England know they can not afford a slip-up or even a rainy day as they prepare to face Bangladesh at the 2015 Cricket World Cup.

The two meet at 2pm on Sunday, or Monday at 3.30am for those in the UK, at the Adelaide Oval with England aiming to avoid early elimination at the group stages.

They are in a precarious position ahead of the game as they know they must beat Bangladesh then Afghanistan in their final two Group A games to have any chance of surviving.

They should be able to see off their next two opponents, but it is a task easier said than done. 

England have endured some rotten World Cups since they went close to winning in Australia in 1992 but to go out in the first round of a competition designed to guarantee progress for the big eight would make this the worst yet.

Defeat by Bangladesh in Adelaide would pile the pressure on coach Peter Moores and the man who appointed him in Paul Downton.
