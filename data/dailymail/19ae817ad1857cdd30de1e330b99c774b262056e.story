When 23-year-old Mandy began complaining of unbearable pain and strange bleeding, doctors told her she was simply too young to have cancer.

But after a long battle to get medical professionals to take her seriously, Mandy was finally diagnosed with bowel cancer. But that was just the beginning of her struggle.

'When they operated on her they sewed her bowels almost fully shut and so a few days out of her surgery she couldn't go to the bathroom and she started to develop toxaemia (blood poisoning) and was in excruciating pain,' photographer Nadia Masot, one of the bright minds behind a new cancer awareness campaign, said.

'Mandy was literally dying, but again she had a lot of trouble trying to get the doctors to believe her.' Scroll down for video

Mandy is one of many Australian women who have bared their scars for the Under The Red Dress Campaign. She was diagnosed with bowel cancer at 23 and had 40cm of her bowel removed before suffering from toxic poisoning due to them being sewn almost shut during surgery

Plagued by temperamental bowels, the mother from Bundaberg, Queensland, now has to have regular check-ups for the rest of her life. Her six-year-old son will also need to start having checks from the age of 12.

Mandy's traumatic experience has led her to bare her scars and share her inspirational cancer survival story, alongside a handful of Australian women in the Under The Red Dress campaign.

The women have posed nude for a book and exhibition to raise awareness for the early detection of cancer, following in the brave footsteps of Beth Whaanga, who made international headlines earlier this year for revealing her own hysterectomy and mastectomy scars.

Inspirational: Beth Whaanga was the first to pose for the project after asking Nadia Masot, her friend of 13 years, to take the snaps in a bid to help her with the healing process in February of this year

Mrs Whaanga had a double mastectomy and full hysterectomy in November last year after being diagnosed with breast cancer. The adverse reactions that she received over social media when posting these photos led her to commit to creating a whole book of similar photographs

Ms Whaanga, a registered nurse and criminologist from Queensland, lost hundreds of Facebook friends after sharing the black and white images on her profile, but she also received hundreds of emails of support.

It was the adverse reactions that Mrs Whaanga received over social media that led her to commit to creating a whole book of similar photographs.

She teamed up with her photographer and best friend of 13-years Nadia Masot to photograph women who have battled cancer across the country for their Under The Red Dress campaign.

When complete, it will feature a total of 50 people under the age of 50, photographed in two thought provoking ways.

Two sides: Triathlete and mother-of-two, Yasmin, had prophylactic total bilateral mastectomies when she learned her mother had breast cancer

The Under The Red Dress project involves two types of images being taken of each person: The first is a highly retouched version (left) of 'how the world would like to see them'. The second, black and white photos (right), are completely unedited and raw showing 'the reality beneath the red dress'

They were inspired to begin the project after receiving several hundred applications from women around the world, who want to share their traumatic stories and learn to love their bodies again.

'I think it was just the fact that we struck a nerve with people, it kind of inspired us the way people reacted. Just all the symbolism behind the red dress came together in this really cool concept and I thought, "we can either just let the experience pass and it's one of those things or we can use that voice as an opportunity to say something",' Mrs Masot said.

One of the women who will feature in the coffee table book and exhibition, is 34-year-old Menerralea, who considered herself lucky to not require chemotherapy after having two surgeries to remove cancerous tissue while 14 and 19 weeks pregnant.

'She was diagnosed with cancer when she was pregnant with her third child,' Mrs Masot said when asked how she selected the women she would photograph.

'That sort of thing really moves me because you’re making a decision about your life and the babies life, potentially. That really strikes a chord with me because that's a really difficult decision.'

Shira is a 34-year-old mother of two living in New York. She had a prophylactic double mastectomy in 2013 as a preventative measure when she learnt she had the breast cancer gene

Arlington, USA resident Liz, was diagnosed with Stage III Invasive Ductal Carcinoma while breastfeeding her fourth baby

Liz had to wean her baby in order to start chemotherapy before she underwent a bilateral mastectomy with expander placement, 36 radiation treatments, and DIEP flap reconstruction

Other women who are taking part in the campaign have had to endure gruelling side effects of surgery.

'One applicant had her breast completely rotted – or so it looks like from the photos,' Mrs Masot said.

'It got gangrene or something due to lack of blood-flow from the failed implant - not implant as in silicon but they use the muscles from your stomach and so it needs to have blood-flow to be able to live, its almost like an organ transplant.

'This one had failed and so her entire breast was black and yellow with pus.

'And so then she's got some after photos once that has been removed, and it's like a gigantic crater that's in her chest. Those sorts of things are quite shocking.'

Beth was 39 when she had a nipple sparing bilateral mastectomy. She suffered numerous post op infections which lead to multiple surgeries and medical treatment over the years

She finally managed to reconstruct her breasts through SGAP flap, a fairly new microsurgery tissue from her bottom. She lives in Virginia, USA with her four children and her husband

Explaining how the shots are chosen, Mrs Masot said: 'We photograph them in a way that the world likes to see them; so for example you've got Beth in a red dress looking glamorous. The photos are highly retouched as well so that it kind of almost looks like a photo you see in a magazine,'

'Next to those, we have the black and white portraits which is when they strip down to their scars. There's absolutely no retouching of those photos whatsoever and it's just really raw. Its kind of like 'this is whats under the red dress'. The idea behind that is to really draw that comparison between what you see everyday and what is actually real.'

Beside the pictures, each person will have a blurb to describe what they have been through and how they feel about their bodies which have changed as a result of having cancer.

Yasmin Grigaliunas, who posed for Mrs Masot after undergoing prophylactic double mastectomies, described how her six and seven-year-old daughters reacted to both versions of the photographs.

'They both commented significantly that I looked like a model and that it wasn’t really like me, that I had too much makeup on and my skin didn’t look that nice and that I have many more spots than what they could see in the images.'

'When they saw the black and white images I could see this calm more natural behaviour in them and they said "mum that's more like what you look like".

'After removing my breasts I look at my body now and I love it more than I’ve ever loved it and I think that the project has really helped me do that.'

If Mrs Masot and Mrs Whaanga receive enough funding for their project through their Kickstarter campagin, they will fulfil their original goal which involved photographing applicants from the US, Canada, Europe and New Zealand alongside the Australian women.

Nadia Masot and Beth Whaanga are the masterminds behind the new project which will result in an exhibition and coffee table book to promote cancer awareness and positive body image for people who have undergone cancer surgeries

Despite continuing to receive criticism for choosing to focus on people under the age of 50, Mrs Masot explained that the collaborating duo wanted to target the discrepancy in awareness amongst younger people who they believe do not receive the same information and support.

'There’s this idea among young people that they are invincible, that nothing is going to happen to them. So it was a choice that we made because we saw it as an opportunity to change that mindset,’ she said.

Mandy's story embodied that idea: 'Because you're so young, people are like 'well it can't be cancer'. It can be,' Ms Masot said.

'She has had quite a plight getting doctors to actually believe her when she says that something is wrong, and there have been almost fatal errors.

'The goal is twofold. We want to raise awareness for cancer and get people to be a lot more vigilant in their screening and just be aware of their bodies and what’s normal and what's not.

'But also, if it does happen to you, that it’s not the end of the world. You're still alive, you've got scars to prove it and you need to still feel beautiful.'
