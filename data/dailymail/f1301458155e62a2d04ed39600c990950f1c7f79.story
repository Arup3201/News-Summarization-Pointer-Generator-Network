Supporters of the Islamic State have taken to Twitter to mock claims the terrorist organisation is luring women into its fold using kittens and Nutella.

The original claim was made by CNN's Newsroom anchor Carol Costello on Wednesday during a piece on how ISIS twists and manipulates its image to present living in the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq currently under the group's control as being a pleasant experience.

The accusation was that women are falling for ISIS' use of images and videos of cute cats to make the Sunni extremists appear less intimidating, and have been duped into thinking life under the terror is similar to the West thanks to references to eating Nutella in emoji-strewn Twitter posts.

The suggestion that women are being lured by the technique has been widely ridiculed - not just in the Western media, but now also by the supporters of the jihadis themselves, who have taken to posing with kittens and posting jokes about the power of the chocolate and hazelnut spread.

One social media user calling themselves Abu Abdulla Amriki, who claims to be an ISIS fighter in Syria, posted a joke message about struggling to find a wife despite possessing kittens and Nutella.

'Yeh...so this is how I heard we get married...lol Why am I still single?[sic],' he posted alongside a black and white photograph of a kitten playing with a jar of chocolate and hazelnut spread. 

The post prompted other militants and their supporters to similar messages.

One, posted by apparently British militant named Abu Hurirah al-Britani, showed a bearded fighter grinning as he holds a jar of Nutella in a photograph understood to have been taken in Syria.

It was captioned with the words 'Wish I had a cat! :-(' 

The joke quickly spread outside the online jihadi community and soon regular Twitter users started posting memes about widely ridiculed report.

This message was posted was an account regularly suspended for uploading pro-Islamic State propaganda

Last summer ISIS militants fighting in Iraq and Syria revealed a bizarre soft spot for Nutella.

Members of the jihadist group posed for photographs holding jars of the Italian sweet treat while standing in supermarkets inside the Islamic State - the group's self-declared caliphate.

The images were subsequently uploaded to Twitter - sparking an intense debate among the fighters and their supporters over the virtues of Nutella.

After the images of the Nutella-loving jihadists emerged on Twitter, a number of users joked that the spread could be the best way to put a halt to the group's expansion in the Middle East.

One Twitter user going by the handle @FatCated asked: 'Could an embargo on Nutella or Chupa Chups (a type of lollypop) destroy the morale of #IS mercenaries? #ISIS'

Another calling herself Ariane al-Britania joked: 'It is very possible that Nutella is responsible 4 the radicalization of Muslims in the West lol.'

A pro-ISIS Twitter account makes light of reports women are lured to the group by chocolate spread

It wasn't the first time ISIS militants  used social media to reveal their surprising interests.

In the wake of Hollywood actor Robin Williams' death  last year dozens of ISIS militants and sympathisers took to Twitter to express their love of his film Jumanji.

The conversation quickly turned to Hollywood films in general, with one 19-year-old ISIS supporter - who calls himself 'Abdullah' and uses the Twiiter handle @Mujahid4life - declaring his love for all 'Disney Renaissance' films and revealing himself to be a fan of Star Wars.

'Abdullah' also said he had stopped watching hit HBO television Game of Thrones after two episodes because it contained too much nudity.

There is also a Twitter account dubbed the Islamic State of Cat, which features masked and gun-toting jihadists holding tiny kittens.
