On screen, Steve McQueen was the King of Cool. With his blond hair, blazing blue eyes and chiselled features, his face was more eloquent than any of the lines written for him in hit movies such as The Great Escape, Bullitt, Getaway and The Thomas Crown Affair.

His tough, raw charisma appealed to male and female cinemagoers alike. He was seen as a romantic hero and an adventurer; uncompromisingly macho, yet with — his fans liked to believe — a gentle heart.

No wonder he became the highest-paid movie star in the world until his death in 1980 at the age of 50, and no wonder his films live on.

Steve McQueen was the world's highest paid movie star until his untimely death in 1980 aged just 50

Away from the public eye, though, McQueen was a bully, riven with demons, deeply insecure because of a damaged childhood, paranoid, aggressive, arrogant, petty-minded, mean with money, contemptuous of women and often violent to them, and a heavy drinker and drug user.

Now a TV documentary sets out to explain the upbringing that made him such a complicated man. It is produced by his son Chad, who knew him better than anyone.

If McQueen’s three marriages were fraught, so were his relationships with his fellow Hollywood movers and shakers.

A loner, he was well known for his rivalry with co-stars and would deliberately set out to steal scenes from them. ‘He was always worried about things being taken away from him,’ says Chad. ‘But if you look at where he came from, you can understand why.’

The tales are legendary. Appearing in The Towering Inferno in 1974 with Paul Newman, he insisted on being given 12 more lines of dialogue, so he and Newman would be equal. He also insisted that the final shot in the film belonged to him and asked the wardrobe department to have the brim of his fireman’s helmet cut back, as he didn’t want his eyes in shadow. They said if his was changed, they would have to change everyone’s. ‘Then change them,’ he said.

When Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was being cast in the late Sixties, McQueen was offered the Sundance role. But when he found out that Newman — his keenest rival — had been cast as Cassidy, he insisted the title should be The Sundance Kid And Butch Cassidy, so his name came before Newman’s. His demand was turned down, and the role went to Robert Redford.

McQueen went on to demand $3 million for a brief cameo in A Bridge Too Far (1977), but received a polite refusal from director Richard Attenborough. He lost the starring role in Close Encounters Of The Third Kind because he wanted too much money, and Richard Dreyfuss stepped in.

In 1979, he was offered Apocalypse Now, but would accept only if the location was moved from the Philippines to Hollywood. Martin Sheen got the role.

Yet McQueen could sometimes turn his perfectionism into extra cash. Making the Thomas Crown Affair (1968), for which he was being paid $750,000, he tried on four expensive watches for one scene, but said they weren’t suitable. Instead he wore his own — and charged the producer $250 for ‘wristwatch rental’.

Chad has heard them all and springs to his father’s defence. ‘People say how difficult he was, but that was because he wasn’t a sheep,’ he insists. ‘He knew what was right for him. He always did his homework and had a good idea about how he wanted to play a scene. He would fight to the death with directors to get his way, but that was how he was with everything. He lived on the edge.’

Chad idolised his father but saw how damaged he was. McQueen was the son of an alcoholic prostitute and was abandoned by both his mother and his father. Passed around family, then living on his wits on the streets, he seemed all set for a life of crime.

‘My dad had a horrible childhood,’ says Chad. ‘It made him the man he was. He fought like hell for what he believed in, but he had a very short temper; I saw that at home and in his work. He wasn’t opposed to knocking somebody out if they crossed him. ’

At 15, in trouble with the police for stealing and fighting, McQueen was sent to a reform school, the California Junior Boys Republic. ‘It was one step away from jail,’ says Chad.

‘For the first time, he felt some stability. His father had left before he was born, his mother had shunted him around, his stepfather had beaten him and he’d grown into his teens practically an orphan. When I was growing up, he never talked about his mother.

‘He always told me, “Son, Boys Republic turned my life around”. When he came out, he went into the Marines for three years, then drifted into acting.’

Chad adds: ‘If any good came out of him feeling so unwanted as a kid, it was that he always made sure me and my older sister, Terry, knew how much he loved us. He wanted to make up for what he never had.’

McQueen insisted his family came with him on long location shoots. ‘If he was our comfort blanket, we were his,’ Chad says.

Chad and Terry may have been McQueen’s priority, but he made it clear that his marriage was to be conducted on his own terms.

He began an affair within weeks of marrying his first wife, Neile Adams, in 1956 — and, as his career took off, he had dalliances with many others. ‘He made no secret of what was going on,’ Neile says in the documentary, ‘and I decided I would have to live with it. Once, he said: “Why do I have to work so hard for love at home when it’s free everywhere else?” ’

‘We knew he loved the ladies,’ smiles Chad. ‘Women would hit on him constantly, even in front of Neile. He was cool about it.’

But there was one rule for McQueen and another for Neile. He became obsessively jealous, convinced she was having an affair, and held a gun to her head to make her confess. ‘He terrified me,’ Neile admits.

When she admitted she’d had a romance with actor Maximilian Schell, McQueen beat her up. A few weeks later, she told McQueen she was pregnant and he made her fly to London for an abortion, saying he couldn’t be sure he was the father. The couple divorced in 1971.

His next film was The Getaway, in which his co-star was Ali MacGraw. Her husband, Robert Evans, was the producer, but the pair had a torrid affair. ‘The attraction was scary,’ Ali reveals in the documentary. They married in 1973 but heaven soon turned to hell: ‘He was tremendously insecure and dangerous.’

McQueen told her she had to give up her career to look after their home — and he expected dinner at 6pm sharp every day. ‘When it was good it was very, very good, but when it was bad it was horrendous,’ she says.

Steve McQueen, was diagnosed with cancer and died in November 1980, probably from breathing asbestos

She has previously told how once, on location, he went off partying with two local beauties, leaving MacGraw alone, and that night she could hear them all in the next room. In the morning, McQueen asked her to cook him breakfast and said nothing about the night before. It was typical of his attitude — he had already banned MacGraw from wearing heels and having long nails.

As he once said: ‘They call me a chauvinist pig. I am and I don’t give a damn.’

‘After five years Steve sort of checked out of the marriage,’ MacGraw says now. ‘Chad would come downstairs and find plates sailing past his head. It was a rotten family scenario.’

Steve’s stardom was consolidated with films including cult horror hit The Blob, The Magnificent Seven and The Great Escape. Yet even at the height of his fame, his insecurity surfaced.

He always demanded bulk consignments of razors and jeans when he started on a movie — it was later discovered that he donated them to Boys Republic.

He loved fast cars but was happiest on his motorbike and when there was a full moon — even in the middle of filming — he would vanish on it for a day or two.

‘It’s not like he was a werewolf, but it did make him go strange. Sometimes he would even bark and growl,’ laughs Chad. ‘He never explained where he went and we didn’t ask.’

After splitting with Ali, Steve grew a beard and travelled the country in a motorhome with his young model girlfriend, Barbara Minty, whom he later married, and Chad.

‘He’d had enough of fame,’ says Chad. ‘He wanted to stay at the beach; he wouldn’t let scripts be delivered to the house, so I’d have to pick them up at a gas station.’

He made only two movies in that period, and it was while filming The Hunter that he started to complain of chest pains. Doctors diagnosed cancer, probably caused by working with asbestos when he was in the Marines.

He fought to the end but died on November 7, 1980.

The McQueen name has lived on. Chad is an actor and also raced cars; his own son Steven is an actor in The Vampire Diaries.

The legend, too, remains. ‘Thirty-four years after he died he is still well loved and respected for his work,’ says Chad. ‘My dad was proof that whatever doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger.’
