After the Football Association announced their plans to introduce Premier League 'B' teams to the Football League, Accrington Stanley have come up with their own proposal.

Greg Dyke is chair of the FA Commission who produced the document, which was revealed by Sportsmail on Tuesday, to help young English players develop in a competitive division below League Two.

But Accrington Stanley posted on Twitter:
 'To increase the number of English players in the top flight we're 
going to launch a B team & apply to join the Premier League.'

The tweet has received over 3,000 retweets to date, though the club mentioned afterwards that it was just a joke.

In the 2012-13 Premier League season only 32 per cent of starts were made by English players, compared with 69 per cent 20 years ago.

Dyke's aim, according to the report the FA produced on Thursday,Â  is to have 90 English players playing more than 50 per cent of games in the top five European Leagues.
