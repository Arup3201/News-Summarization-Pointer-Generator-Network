Brazilian-born Portugal player Deco has been cleared of doping because of faulty testing by a Rio de Janeiro laboratory which has since been suspended from World Cup duty.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport says a settlement between Deco, the Brazilian football federation and FIFA annulled his one-year ban imposed last September.

The lab is further discredited after being suspended by the World Anti-Doping Agency last August. It was dropped from World Cup testing, forcing FIFA to fly samples to Lausanne.

Cleared: Deco's one-year ban for doping has been annulled because of faulty testing by a Rio lab

The case against former Chelsea and Barcelona player Deco collapsed when his samples were re-tested in Lausanne.

The CAS ruling says: 'It could not be established that (Deco) has committed an anti-doping rule violation.'

The 36-year-old retired player allegedly tested positive for hydrochlorothiazide and tamoxifen in early 2013.
