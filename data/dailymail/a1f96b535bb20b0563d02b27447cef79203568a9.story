Former ambassador: Chelsea Ives will also stand trial accused of attacking a rickshaw driver

A shamed former Olympic youth ambassador today admitted going looting two nights running during the London riots.

Chelsea Ives, 18, pleaded guilty to a string of offences over two separate nights in Enfield and Hackney when she appeared at Wood Green Crown Court.

The talented athlete and singer admitted criminal damage after she was caught on CCTV on August 7th damaging a BMW police car in Enfield.

She also admitted burglary with intent to steal, after she broke into a looted T-Mobile phone store, and violent disorder while in Enfield. 

Her appalled mother Adrienne, who was in court, handed her in to police after she saw footage of her daughter damaging the police car on television.

Ives - a former Waltham Forest Council youth Olympic ambassador - was initially remanded in custody after being charged in connection with the rioting in Enfield.

But when police reviewed CCTV footage of the next night's disorder they spotted her joining in with a gang attacking a supermarket in Hackney, the court heard.

She pleaded guilty to violent disorder on Lower Clapton Road, Hackney, where she and a gang of 10 others were spotted trying to force entry into a Somerfields supermarket.

At an earlier hearing the prosecution told the court how Ives had picked up a rock and thrown it in the direction of police cars travelling on Lower Clapton Road.

She denied a charge of burglary with intent to steal from HMV on Church Street, Enfield, and a similar charge relating to a break-in at the Somerfield supermarket in Hackney the next night.

Ives, who was wearing a short green top with her hair tied back, spoke only to confirm her name and indicate her plea to each of six charges during today's hearing.

Howard Tobias, prosecuting, said the Crown would consider dropping the burglary with intent to steal charges.

He said: 'It is something the Crown must consider before sentencing.'

Elroy Claxton, representing Ives, asked the Probation Service to prepare a pre-sentence report.

Mr Claxton told the court his client also faces a trial in relation to an unrelated incident during which a rickshaw driver was assaulted in central London.

Ives, who denies the charge, is accused of assaulting rickshaw rider Uzeyir Guler in Leicester Square after she allegedly refused to pay a £20 fare.

Harris, and Chantelle Ives, also 18 and from Leytonstone, East 
London, are both charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and making 
off without payment. 

They deny the assault and are due to stand 
trial in the week beginning November 28.

The court heard today that Ives has three previous convictions all related to an incident when she was 'riding on the railway without payment that led to an altercation.'

The details of the convictions were not revealed in court. Judge Shaun Lyons said: 'She was riding on the railways and there was an incident. She was given a suspended sentence so it must have been quite serious.'

Mr Claxton agreed and said it was quite a serious offence.

At the time of handing her in, her mother Adrienne, 43, said: 'I have no regrets. I love my daughter, but she was brought up to know right from wrong.'

Judge Shaun Lyons adjourned sentencing to a date to be set.

He said the rioting matter would be dealt with at Wood Green Crown Court while the court must consider a date for sentencing in light of the trial.
