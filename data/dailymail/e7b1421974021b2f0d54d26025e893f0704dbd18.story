'Reprehensible crime': Claire Mosby, who stole over £31,000 from a school safe containing dinner money and funds for trips to fund her bingo addiction

A bingo addict who stole £31,000 to fund her habit from the primary school where she worked has been jailed.

Claire Mosby was branded 'reprehensible' by a judge for placing her colleagues under suspicion by planting a spare key in the school safe, as the net began to close on her two-year deception.

Mosby, 38, a former pupil and parent governor at Swarcliffe Primary School, Leeds, West Yorkshire, worked as office manager when she stole cash from the safe between 2009 and 2011.

The cash had been collected for school dinners, from the school's nursery, breakfast club, after school club and a voluntary fund, made up of contributions to pay for extras such as school trips.

Instead of banking the takings, the married mother-of-three used it fund her online gambling and bingo habit.

She was jailed for 18 months at Leeds Crown Court.

Judge Christopher Batty said: 'Swarcliffe Primary School is the heart of the community in which you and your family still live.

'The money that you stole represents the monies collected by the school from parents in the school. 'Money you know only too well they could ill-afford to give in the first place.'

He added: 'I'm afraid it comes down to this - you did not care. Your need was too great.'

Mosby originally began volunteering as a school governor and quickly became friends with headteacher Susan Sanderson, who recommended that she be put forward for the office manager's job.

Suspicions about her behaviour were first raised by a council-employed school finance officer over low income levels in the school's dinner money account.

The court heard Mosby's bank account details showed expenditure linked to online gambling and bingo websites, payments to loan companies - and even cash withdrawals from a machine close to a Mecca Bingo.

As her deception was about to be discovered in March 2011, Mosby went into the school at a weekend and put a spare key in the safe in a bid to cover her tracks.

The next day she went to police to report cash being stolen.

The judge said those actions amounted to Mosby 'laying down your defence'. He added: 'No one needs to tell you how reprehensible your behaviour is.'

A jury found Mosby guilty of theft after a trial last year.

Mosby, of Leeds, claimed she had known cash was going missing but did not report it as she would be putting the headteacher under pressure.
