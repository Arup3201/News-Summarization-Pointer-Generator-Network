Nicolas Sarkozy will this week appear before a judge to answer allegations that he accepted illegal cash from France’s richest woman, it emerged today.

In a humiliating process which could end with the former president being jailed, Mr Sarkozy has been summoned to a court in Bordeaux.

There he will be grilled by Judge Jean-Michel Gentil about his highly suspicious relationship with l’Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt.

Mr Sarkozy, 57, is said to have personally accepted brown envelopes full of cash from the multi-millionaire’s family.

They were paid to help fund Mr Sarkozy’s 2007 election campaign, in return for massive tax breaks when he came to office, it is alleged.

Fraud squad officers have already raided the Paris home Mr Sarkozy shares with his former supermodel wife, Carla Bruni.

This happened just two weeks after the conservative Mr Sarkozy lost his immunity from prosecution after being defeated in the May presidential election by Francois Hollande, the Socialist candidate.

It was the first time that a former president’s home was subjected to a police raid, with Socialist interior minister Manuel Valls saying that Mr Sarkozy ‘is answerable to the law like anyone else.’

A number of former employees of Mrs Bettencourt have the told the judge that Mr Sarkozy discreetly turned up at her mansion in the Paris suburb of Neuilly to pick up money.

Judge Gentil has already cited two withdrawals of 400,000 euros each by Mrs Bettencourt which are said to have been handed over in person to Mr Sarkozy and his former treasurer, Eric Woerth.

Mr Woerth later became employment minister but resigned in 2010 over the growing funding scandal, over which he has now been charged.

French law limits individual donations to political parties to 7,500 euros (£6,000) per person per year and 4,600 euros (£3,700) during political campaigns.

Only 150 euros (£120) may be given in cash. Mr Sarkozy was due to appear before the Bordeaux judge on Friday, but the appearance was moved back to this week, reported Paris radio station Europe 1.

Last December Mr Sarkozy’s predecessor as president and mentor, Jacques Chirac, was found guilty of embezzlement in a Paris court and given a suspended prison sentence.

Mr Sarkozy can be questioned as a ‘witness’ or a ‘suspect’ or placed under formal investigation – one step short of a charge - for breaking electoral law. If prosecuted and found guilty, Mr Sarkozy would also face jail.

Mr Sarkozy, who has been unemployed since May, denies any wrong-doing.

He is facing a number of other corruption enquiries, including claims that he accepted millions from former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.

Sarkozy has previously claimed that the Gaddafi accusations are 'grotesque'.
