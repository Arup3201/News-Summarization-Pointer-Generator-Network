A young man decided to give his parents the best Christmas gift ever this year, and it didn’t come in a gift-wrapped box.

Lucas Irwin, 25, shocked his parents when he walked into their home 130 pounds lighter than he was a year ago when they had last seen him - and when he weighed 300 pounds.

He kept his year-long effort a secret from his family, but caught the big moment on camera – a video that has now gone viral on the internet with over 620,000 hits on YouTube.

After: This is what he looks like now after going on a year-long diet

Irwin is seen walking down the stairs to his father and step-mother, who are waiting to see him and the shock on their faces is a moment none of them will ever forget.

‘All of the sudden, down the stairs he came,’ his father, Jeff Irwin, told Today in New York.

‘And he looked just fantastic. I was more stunned than anything else. But inside, I was just beaming. I was just ... I was over the moon.’

‘Just picturing it in my mind again, it brings back tears to my eyes again,’ Susan Irwin, his stepmother, said. ‘I am so proud of him.’

According to Irwin junior, he was feeling the jitters before the family reunion.

‘I only go home once or twice a year, usually once in the summer, once for Christmas,’ he said. ‘And I made up an excuse not to go home over the summer just so they wouldn't see me.’

Irwin lost his 130 pounds by following a strict eating regimen. He stayed accountable to himself by keeping a food diary, writing down everything he ate for the year.

He said he lost 95 per cent of the weight through changing his diet alone.

Constant struggle: He says his weight is something that he has struggled with all his life

‘I only ate 1,350 calories a day. I didn't exercise at all until maybe seven or eight months in.’

Though he didn’t seek the support of his family, he did turn to the Internet for backup, particularly the Reddit 'LoseIt' community, which he says was very helpful.

‘It’s something that I have struggled with all my life. So I started December the 28th of 2012 and just went for a year.’
