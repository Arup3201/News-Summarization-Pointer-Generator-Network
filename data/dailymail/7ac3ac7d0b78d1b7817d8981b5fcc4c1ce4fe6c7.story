For the second time in a week, a python has swallowed a family pet in the backyard of an Australian home.

After last week's dog-swallowing incident in Caniaba, New South Wales, a snake has followed suit in Queensland's idyllic Whitsundays, the Daily Mercury reports.

Michelle Grigg says she found Walter, the family dog, in the belly of a python that had crept on to her property.

Cringeworthy stuff: Michelle Grigg says she has been dealing with snakes on her property ever since she was a girl - but not like this

'My husband went out on the road to look for him,' she said.

'I was standing out on our patio where we have big pot plants and I looked down at my feet and there was the snake.'

While she didn't seem terribly fussed, having dealt with snakes since she was a child, she admits her kids were more shaken up by the death of the Maltese-Shih tzu cross.

'I was very calm. I'm good in stressful situations,' she said.

'I woke them up for school and told them what had happened. They were absolutely devastated and my son wanted me to have killed it so he could have buried Walter.

'But I picked up the snake and relocated it.'

Ms Grigg says her seven-year-old daughter didn't take the news well.

'This little dog was given to her as a gift from her aunty, it was her everything,' she told The Courier-Mail.

Last week a python swallowed a 'possum-sized' dog and a length of chain after pouncing on the pet pooch's kennel.

Animal rescue volunteer Sue Ulyatt from the Wildlife Information Rescue and Education Service (WIRES) said it was rare to see a snake swallow a dog.

'We’ve just checked our stats and it's actually only the second time in the last ten years that we know of,' she said last week.

'It's usually the other way around; the snake comes off second best.'

Now that's twice in one week.
