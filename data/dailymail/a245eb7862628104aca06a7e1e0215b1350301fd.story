Sentenced: Ebony Martin, 34, who is a U.S. Government employee, fabricated triplets so that her boyfriend could receive extra food stamps. She has been jailed for 30 days

A U.S. Government employee fabricated triplets so that her boyfriend could receive extra food stamps, a court has heard.

Ebony Martin, 34, created a fake state file for her boyfriend Keith Jones while she worked at the Illinois Department of Human Services.

Prosecutors said the file includes the names and social security numbers of triplets which Mr Jones claimed to have to support.

The court was told that the false details were placed in the file so the 38-year-old could receive more food assistance from the government.

Jones went on to receive $21,866 in food benefits In less than a year.

The couple also made money by selling some food stamps to family members and friends.

According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Assistant State Attorney Diane Michalak, who prosecuted Martin, said: 'She was a government official who abused her trust.

'The crime couldnâ€™t have been done without her.'

Martin was sentenced yesterday to 30 days in jail after she pleaded guilty to felony theft of government services.

She was also placed on probation for three years and was told to pay $21,000.

After the scam emerged, Martin was put on paid administrative leave. She is now expected to be fired from her position.

Jones is still at large despite being charged with state benefit fraud and felony theft.
