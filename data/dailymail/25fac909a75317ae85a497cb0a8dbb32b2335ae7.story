A married software executive dramatically changed his plea to guilty in a Houston court on Wednesday and admitted drugging and sexually assaulting one of his female employees.

In doing so, Henri Morris, 67, spared as many as half a dozen women having to testify that he would take them on business trips, spike their drinks, abuse them and take naked pictures of them.

Shaking as he admitted his guilt, Morris now faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine and will have to register for the rest of his life as a sex offender.

In exchange for changing his plea, prosecutors agreed to drop the other sexual abuse charges against him and thereby spare his accusers of being cross examined in the witness box.

Guilty: Sixty-seven-year-old Henri Morris admitted to one count of taking a person across state lines to commit a sex crime on Wednesday. The former head of Edible Software faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He will have to register as a sex offender

US District Judge Melinda Harmon told Morris that she would have him back in her courtroom in February for sentencing and reminded him he tried to cut a deal last year that would have seen him serve only one year in prison.

'The truth comes out,' said one of the women to the Houston Chronicle. 'He got away with it for a long time and now everybody knows who he truly is.'

Morris, who was the president of Edible Software Solutions was characterized as a 'calculated and choreographed' sexual predator who would take female employees on business trips and use his 'rape kit' to drug them.

Prosecutor Sherri Zack said that one of his victims approached the FBI in 2012 that she believed Morris had drugged and abused her while away for work.

Company: Prosecutors say Morris was a calculating sexual predator who brought rape drugs on business trips to use on employees. They say he physically abused and photographed them

She said they had gone for a drink and then she woke up, nude and confused under a hotel room desk to see Morris taking pictures of her.

Officers began an investigation and discovered other women at Edible Software had similar stories.

So, in 2012, the victim who first approached the FBI worked with them to set up Morris for an arrest at Bush Continental Airport.

When he was taken into custody, agents discovered a 'rape kit' in his possession which contained date rape drugs and Viagra.

Morris' defense team had previously tried to argue that the women willingly drank to excess with their client but that no abuse had ever occurred.

The former executive admitted adultery but until Wednesday refuted any claims he was a date rapist.
