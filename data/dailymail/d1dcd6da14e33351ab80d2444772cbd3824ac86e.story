Award: Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, received an honorary doctorate from the University of York

The mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence has been awarded an honorary doctorate following her long fight for justice.

Doreen Lawrence was praised for her 'tireless campaign against racism and inequality', as she received the award at the University of York.

After 'devoting a large part of her life to social justice', Mrs Lawrence was praised for bringing about changes that 'allow people to live without fear and discrimination'.

She has tirelessly campaigned against racism following her son's murder in 1993.

Stephen was just 18 when he was stabbed to death by a gang of white thugs at a bus stop in Eltham, South-East London.

His mother bravely fought for justice and last year Gary Dobson, 36, and David Norris, 35, were convicted of the murder.

Mrs Lawrence, 60, was today awarded the honorary degree by Dr Rowland Atkinson from the university's Department of Sociology.

Dr Atkinson said: 'Doreen's campaigning has brought 
changes to policing, civil rights and attitudes to race to allow people 
to live without fear and discrimination.

'Doreen's work has challenged prejudice and promoted the vision of a positive community in her son's name.

'It takes great courage to condemn such behaviour.'

In the years after her son's death, Mrs Lawrence founded the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust to help young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.

She also sits on the board of Liberty, the human rights organisation, and is a patron of the hate-crime charity Stop Hate UK.

Campaigner: Mrs Lawrence said she was 'very emotional' receiving the award and described education as 'the most precious gift that we can give our children'

Accepting the award, Mrs Lawrence said: 'I see education as the most 
precious gift that we can give our children.'

She said that institutional racism had inspired her to set up the Stephen Lawrence Charitable 
Trust to help 'black and ethnic minorities achieve their ambitions'.

She said: 'Today has been very emotional for me. I 
find myself choking up when I try and speak about what a great honour 
this is.'

'I feel that all the work I have done over the years has truly been recognised and that is very special.

Reward: Doreen Lawrence with her Women of the Year award last year. She described the recognition of her work as 'special'

Change: During her acceptance speech she said: 'I feel like some things have changed since then and I believe there is now more awareness surrounding racism and inequality'

'When Stephen was killed I felt like no one was interested in his case. That made me push even harder for change.

'I feel like some things have changed since then and I believe there is now more awareness surrounding racism and inequality.'

Sadness: Referring to Stephen's ambition to study architecture, she said: 'I was never able to enjoy that and I feel a part of me is still missing'

The doctorate is the latest in a long line of awards that Mrs Lawrence has received for her campaigning.

In 2003, she was awarded an OBE for services to community relations and last summer was chosen as a flagbearer at the Opening Ceremony of the 
Olympics, alongside boxer Muhammad Ali and UN Secretary General Ban 
Ki-moon.

Last year, she also received a special award at the Women of the Year award, as well as another honorary doctorate from the University of East London.

There was also place for sadness in Mrs Lawrence's acceptance speech as she reflected upon Stephen's ambition to study 
architecture at university before he was murdered.

She said: 'Every parent longs to see 
their child grow up and be successful. Seeing all the graduates today I 
thought of Stephen and his wish to study architecture.

'I was never able to enjoy that and I feel a part of me is still missing.'

Mrs Lawrence also said: 'I
am concerned that the current economic climate may start to reverse all
of that as people may forget to continue the progress that has been 
made.

'We must never forget to keep on campaigning for change.'
