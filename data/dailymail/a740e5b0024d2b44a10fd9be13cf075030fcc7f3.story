A jealous husband who thought his wife had cheated on him littered the neighbourhood with racy pictures of her in an act of revenge.

Ian Cuthbert stuck the saucy posters on cars and trees and even pinned one on the noticeboard at a local primary school.

They showed a photo of Alison Kidd in a provocative pose wearing black lingerie alongside the wording ‘Lock up your husbands’ and ‘Married 16/03/2013 and committing adultery within days’.

Couple: Alison Kidd and Ian Cuthbert wed last year but fell out several months later and are now divorcing

Cuthbert, who thought the 34-year-old nursery assistant had cheated on 
him with another  man, began his campaign when their marriage faltered 
just six months after they became man  and wife.

The IT manager had a
 number of the leaflets printed, which he nailed to trees and put on car
 windshields and through letterboxes.

Raunchy: Cuthbert distributed this poster of his estranged wife around their neighbourhood

Mother-of-two Miss Kidd, who is now seeking a divorce, said he was very bitter after she announced she was leaving him.

She said: ‘It was an extremely abusive relationship.

‘I’m happy to put it behind  me and try to move on with my  life. It was mental abuse and a  very bad time in my life. I was shocked and embarrassed by what happened, but to be honest I wasn’t surprised he did something like that.’

The couple were married on March 16 last year at the Houston House Hotel in Uphall, West Lothian, but the marriage soon fell into difficulty and Miss Kidd moved out of their home in July last year.

In September Cuthbert began distributing the posters of his wife around the East Craigs area of Edinburgh.

Miss Kidd added: ‘It was the sort of thing he would do. He’s a nasty piece of work. He was very bitter that I wanted to leave and he was paranoid. I previously received a string of abusive texts and emails from him.’

Cuthbert, 46, pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner by putting flyers up near to East Craigs Primary School.

Fiscal depute Bruce Macrosson told the court earlier this week that Miss Kidd had been informed about the flyers by friends and contacted police.

Defence solicitor, James Kelly, representing Cuthbert, said:  ‘He accepts his responsibility for the offence.’

Guilty: Cuthbert has admitting behaving in a threatening or abusive manner towards Ms Kidd

Sheriff Isabella McColl told Cuthbert that his actions were ‘a form of assault’ and called for background reports. Sentencing was deferred.

Miss Kidd said her husband’s bail conditions meant he was prevented from approaching her or coming near to where she lives.

‘The police told me they expect he’ll get away with community sentence. I just want to make sure I never see him again.’
