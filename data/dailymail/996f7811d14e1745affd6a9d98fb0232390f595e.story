A male wedding guest was shot by a stray bullet at an Egyptian ceremony as dancing revellers fired handguns in celebration, video footage has revealed.

The young man, aged in his early twenties and wearing a black t-shirt with a white motif, dropped to the floor after a shot was fired into the crowd, which included several young children.

But the shooter then carried on dancing oblivious to what happened, before members of the crowd started to intervene, according to the video which was uploaded onto LiveLeak yesterday.

Video footage reveals that at least five shots were fired as dozens of drunk young men danced wildly around a fire.

The first shot was heard off-camera, but a young man in his twenties wearing a black leather jacket and a graphic t-shirt then fired a second shot into the air.

He then brandished the gun and started dancing very close to the flames.

A third shot was then fired directly into the crowd by the man wearing the lather jacket and a fourth was aimed at the floor.

The young man, who was accidentally hit, dropped after the floor after the fifth shot, but it is not clear who shot him.

Members of the crowd first started attacking a man in a checked shirt, before others approached the man in the black leather jacket and grabbed his gun.

The identities of the men involved are not yet known and the exact location of the shooting has not been revealed. 

The condition of the young man who was accidentally shot is also not known. 

The video has more than 125,000 views on LiveLeak and almost 5,000 views on YouTube.
