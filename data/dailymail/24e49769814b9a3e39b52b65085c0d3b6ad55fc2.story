An incredible video has captured the six-ton Nasa satellite doomed to fall to Earth this week - NASA is slowly narrowing the area it could strike down. So far, it looks unlikely to hit the US, but the rest of the planet is still terrifyingly vulnerable.

Astrophotographer Thierry Legault's clip, shot in northern France, shows the 20-year-old Upper Atmosphere 
Research Satellite (UARS), appearing as a beaming mass of light as it plummets to Earth - where there is a one in 3,200 chance it could hit someone.

The 1,200lb satellite will, Nasa estimates, break into more than 100 pieces
on re-entry, and some will burn up - but it's estimated that around 26 
of the heaviest metal pieces WILL hit the surface - in lumps weighing up
to 300lbs.

Tumbling to Earth: Images from Mr Legault's video show the 20-year-old Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), appearing as a beaming mass of light

Danger: The six-ton Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite will crash to Earth and could land in Britain

Best guess: The satellite could fall anywhere between the two latitudes, where billions of people live

Debris could be scattered over an area
up to 500 miles long. It would be the first time in history someone was
injured by space debris.

Mr Legault's footage of UARS was 
captured through the lens of his Celestron EdgeHD 14in 
Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope in Dunkerque, France on September 15 - 
eight to nine days before its estimated re-entry.

Filmed at an altitude of only 250km, the body of the UARS is visible, as are its solar arrays.

Mr Legault told the skywatching 
website Spaceweather.com: 'The satellite appears to be tumbling, perhaps
because a collision with satellite debris a few years ago. The 
variations in brightness are rapid and easily visible to the human eye.'

The Upper Atmosphere Research 
Satellite, or UARS, ran out of fuel in 2005 and could land on any of six
continents. NASA says it could land at any point between 57 degrees 
north and 57 degrees south - which includes almost all the populated 
areas of our planet (see map below).

Most of the satellite will burn up 
during re-entry, but a 1,200 pounds of metal metal will still plummet to 
the Earth’s surface.

Astronomer Dr Ian Griffin, from the UK Association of Science and Discovery Centres, says the Earth's atmosphere slows down falling satellites a great deal.

He explained that what remains of UARS will hit the ground relatively slowly and 'certainly not at orbital velocity of 17,500mph'.

Much of any satellite crashing to Earth will be disintegrated by heat, caused by friction with the atmosphere. It's the reason we get shooting stars - created by meteors burning up in the upper atmosphere. UARS is large enough, though, that up over a ton will strike the ground. It will not be in one piece, however:  space vehicles experience incredible stress on re-entry. The load can be as much as 10Gs. An F1 car experiences around 5Gs with maximum braking from high speed.

The reason why the location of the crash site is so hard to predict is because the density of the atmosphere varies so greatly higher up, producing different amounts of drag.

A prediction that was wrong by even a few minutes would mean the satellite landing a huge distance away, owing to its speed.

Don't worry too much, though - the odds of any one particular person being hit are much lower, around one in 21 trillion.

It’s
being tracked by the Joint Space Operations Center of U.S. Strategic 
Command at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, but Nasa admits it 
has no idea where it will come down, or when.

The
space agency said that the crash site will be anywhere between 57 
degrees north latitude and 57 degrees south latitude and the remains 
could scatter over a 500mile area.

That means pieces of it could land in Scotland – or somewhere in Chile.

However, a Nasa spokesman pointed out that there has yet to be any reported injury from falling space debris.

He said: ‘The risk to public safety or property is extremely small, and safety is NASA's top priority. Since the beginning of the Space Age in the late-1950s, there have been no confirmed reports of an injury resulting from re-entering space objects.

This satellite is far smaller than 
the 135-ton Russian space station Mir, which fell to Earth in 2001 or 
the 100-ton Skylab that fell in 1979. So far this year alone, two large Russian rocket stages have fallen to earth without inflicting any injury.

Mir
fell into the South Pacific, while Skylab hit the Indian Ocean and 
parts of sparsely populated western Australia. Because two-thirds of the
Earth is ocean, space debris usually hits water.

Nasa is urging anyone who finds a piece of the UARS satellite not to touch it.

The
spokesman added: ‘If you find something you think may be a piece of 
UARS, do not touch it. Contact a local law enforcement official for 
assistance.’

It was launched
back in 1991 by the Space Shuttle Discovery to measure ozone levels, 
wind speeds and temperatures in the stratosphere.

Junk yard in space: UARS is one of the thousands of objects in Earth orbit being tracked by Nasa, as shown by this computer graphic

But now it’s one of 370,000 pieces of junk floating in space at speeds of up to 22,000mph.

The volume of debris was greatly increased by a 2007 Chinese anti-satellite weapon test and a 2009 crash-in-orbit of two satellites.

The widely criticised Chinese test used a missile to smash an ageing weather satellite into 150,000 pieces of 1cm debris and 3,118 pieces can be tracked by radar on the ground.

The UARS is something of a relic - these days, Nasa satellites are designed to be light enough to burn up on re-entry, or to have fuel to fly up into a higher, longer-term orbit.
