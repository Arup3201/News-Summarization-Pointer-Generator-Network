A grieving bride discovered she was pregnant two months after her new husband’s sudden death.

Rhiannon Llewellyn was left devastated when sports coach Dale Llewellyn, 25, died from a blood clot last January just six months after they married.

The 25-year-old had no idea she was pregnant on the day that she buried her childhood sweetheart at the same church that their wedding took place.

Dale and Rhiannon on their wedding day: Six months later he died from a blood clot

Bitter sweet: The grieving bride discovered she was pregnant two months after her husband's death

Rhiannon said: 'I was utterly overwhelmed, it was definitely bitter sweet. I still think of Dale every day. Losing him was the worst day of my life. He was such a fit lad you just couldn’t believe it.'

Seven months after laying him to rest, Rhiannon gave birth to a healthy 6lb 1oz girl last September and called her Grace Evie-Dale in tribute

Rhiannon said having a child 'saved her life' by helping her cope with the pain of suddenly losing fit and healthy Dale.

She said: 'She is quite literally my saving grace.

Shock: Dale was fit and healthy before his death

'Words cannot begin to describe how much I love and miss my Dale but out of that heartbreak came something so beautiful and precious.

'He would be so proud and totally besotted with her.

'She would have been the apple of her daddy’s eye. I will never let a day go by without telling her about her amazing daddy, now the brightest star in the sky.'

Tragic: Sports coach Dale was just 25 when he was laid to rest at the same church where he tied the knot months before

Keeping his memory alive: Rhiannon said daughter Grace will know all about her father

Dale and Rhiannon were 'inseparable' school sweethearts and tied the knot in August, 2012.

They had planned to have a family but Rhiannon suffered a miscarriage when she first fell pregnant.

She had no idea she was pregnant again on the day of Dale's funeral - at the same church where they were married.

She had regularly sick been sick since his death but put it down to the stress of losing Dale, so was shocked when she found out she was pregnant.

Rhiannon gave birth to a healthy baby who weighed 6lb and 1oz and gave her the middle name Dale as a tribute.

She said Grace has already developed an attachment to her father, regularly falling asleep holding a gold pendant with his face on it. An inscription on the back reads: 'Don't count each day, make each day count.'

Rhiannon said: 'Dale lived his life by that motto, Grace finds comfort in holding the pendant to send her off to sleep.

'Dale was a true young gentleman, irreplaceable, full of life and laughter with a heart of gold and a beaming smile.

'I'm utterly honoured to be his wife and the mother to his precious little princess.'
