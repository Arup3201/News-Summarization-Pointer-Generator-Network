Australia Day organisers have launched an ambitious campaign to get people across the country to sing the national anthem in unison at midday on January 26.

The National Australia Day Council (NADC) says Advance Australia Fair will be sung at official events around the country but wants people at beaches, barbecues and other ceremonies  to stop at noon and join in.

NADC chief executive Jeremy Lasek said it was a 'great way' to unite the nation.

Australia Day organisers have launched an ambitious campaign to get Australians across the country to sing the national anthem in unison at midday on January 26

'We certainly encourage people to get involved and take that moment to think about Australia Day and what is great about being Australian and belt out our national anthem,' Mr Lasek told ABC Radio.

'In Sydney at the harbour it will happen with a great deal of pomp and ceremony on the new Navy vessel HMAS Canberra with a 21-gun salute.

'While in the ACT the biggest event is a concert in Commonwealth Park where the national anthem will be played and sung with great passion and energy.'

The council is also encouraging people celebrating Australia Day to share what they are doing on social media with the hashtag #AustraliaDay.

In New South Wales Royal Australian Navy, Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force will combine to perform a 'Sault to Australia'. This will involve the 21-gun sault as well as an aerial flyover of RAAF jets.
