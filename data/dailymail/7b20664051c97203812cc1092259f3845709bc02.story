The BBC was last night refusing to say whether DJ Mike Read’s ‘racist’ Ukip Calypso track would be played in full on the radio tomorrow if it remained in the Top 40.

The song, which Mr Read pulled after it caused an uproar, was ranked at 21 in the official midweek charts. The former Radio 1 DJ puts on a Jamaican accent to praise Ukip in the Caribbean-style track which has led to accusations of racism.

A BBC spokesman last night said: ‘The song is not currently on our playlist and, as the chart is compiled at the end of the week, we cannot say what will be in the Official Chart on Sunday.’

His Ukip anthem, sung in a Jamaican accent, warns of 'illegal immigrants in every town'

Earlier this week, BBC Berkshire host Mr Read apologised and asked his record company to withdraw his song. But the track was still available to download for 79p on Amazon.co.uk last night.

Mr Read said he felt ‘absolutely terrible’ that people might have been offended.

He said the Ukip anthem – sung in a Jamaican accent warning of ‘illegal immigrants in every town’ – had been intended as just ‘a bit of fun’.

‘I don’t have a racist bone in my body,’ he added.

The BBC faced the same dilemma last year when the Wizard of Oz song ‘Ding Dong! The Witch is Dead’ reached number two in the Official Chart following the death of Lady Margaret Thatcher.

Radio 1 ended up playing a seven-second soundbite of the 1939 song accompanied by a news report on the anti-Thatcher campaign.
