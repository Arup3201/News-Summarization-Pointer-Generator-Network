Doomed and saved: An ash tree infected by dieback which may now be a sight soon forgotten

Scientists have made a breakthrough in the battle against the disease that is ravaging Britain’s ash population.

They have unravelled the genetic code of a tree that is resistant to ash dieback.

The information could be used to breed ashes that are impervious to the killer fungus – and, in time, repopulate Britain’s forests and woodlands.

The scientists behind the breakthrough describe it as ‘giving nature a helping hand’.

However, it may not be a help in protecting the UK’s existing ash population, which is being killed off by the rapid spread of the disease.

Ash dieback, which ravaged other European countries before entering the UK, kills 90 per cent of the trees it affects.

It has spread to 500 sites since first spotted here little more than a year ago

Experts fear it could become the new Dutch elm disease, causing widespread destruction of one of Britain’s best-loved trees.

The country’s 80million ash trees support wildlife as well as the £10billion timber industry and take up about a third of British woodland.

Researchers at The Sainsbury Laboratory and the John Innes Centre, both in Norwich, have decoded the DNA of a Danish ash tree that was found to be able to withstand the fungus.

Known as Tree 35, it remained healthy, while other trees around it withered and died.

Scientists around the world are being encouraged to analyse the data, which could be used to seek out ashes in Britain that have a similar genetic profile.

Other options include crossing Tree 35 
with native ashes – or breeding with other trees known to be immune to 
ash dieback – to create a stock of super-resistant saplings.

It will take ten to 20 years to breed saplings suitable for restocking the countryside.

Professor Allan Downie, of the John Innes Centre, said: ‘We’re trying to give nature a bit of a helping hand by identifying the right kind of trees to do the appropriate crosses.

‘It would be wonderful to be part of the solution but the problem is enormous and breeding is going to take a long time.’

While fungicides might help in some cases, the probability is that Britain will lose most of its ash trees, he said.
