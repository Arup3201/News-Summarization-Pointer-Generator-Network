A western Pennsylvania coroner is auctioning off about 100 guns used in suicides and accidental shooting deaths.

Corner Ken Bacha says the November 8 surplus weapons sale is Westmoreland County government's first since his father Leo Bacha was coroner in the 1980s

He says state law requires local governments sell off unclaimed property. Proceeds will help fund county government.

Sinister sale: Those wishing to own a gun used in a suicide or accidental shooting can buy one in Pennsylvania 

Bacha's office took possession of the guns during death investigations. Family members had a year to get them back before they became county property. 

Some of the weapons have been in the county's hands for decades.

Bacha says guns were used in 34 of the 55 suicides in the county last year.

No weapons used in homicides are being auctioned off. They're kept in storage for use as evidence.

WTAE reports that as the auction date gets closer the coroner and auctioneer are seeing a growing interest.

'Now as we are a week and a half away, we're getting more phone calls, several today. I talked to the auctioneer earlier today, and he's getting a lot of hits to his website and a lot of calls to his office as well,' Bacha said.

'I know when my dad had the auction in the 80s, there were guns that were valued at $100 brand new that were selling for $200. Was it just the novelty of it, that this gun took a life? I'm not really sure.' 

Bacha made sure to say that none of the guns were used in homicides.

'Most of these firearms that are going to be auctioned are non-homicide firearms, meaning accidental deaths, but most of them are suicides,'Bacha said.

Bacha added that guns often go for more than the going price because of the 'novelty' and story behind their use.

Jacking up the price: Guns may go for more than their actual worth because of their novelty factor since they were used to kill someone in a shooting or an accidental suicide
