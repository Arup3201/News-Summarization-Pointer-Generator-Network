Helped by his friends and grimacing with every step, new photographs taken on Sunday reveal the slow and painful progress Tracy Morgan is making as he recovers from June's devastating car crash.

Wearing a pained expression on his face, the 30 Rock star gingerly made his way to the barbers near his home in Cresskill, New Jersey.

Dressed for the cold in a leather jacket, blue jeans and Nike sneakers, the comedian's friends watched as he took slow and deliberate steps, never seeming to take their eyes off him.

Rare appearance: Morgan's Sunday outing marked the fourth time he has been seen in public since the highway collision in June 

Morgan's Sunday outing marked the fourth time he has been seen in public since the highway collision in June that took the life of his friend and fellow comic James McNair and injured three others.

The 46-year-old former star of 30 Rock suffered a traumatic brain injury and numerous fractures when a Wal-Mart tractor-trailer slammed into the back of his limo van on New Jersey Turnpike.

Earlier this month, Morgan told reporters outside a post office in New Jersey that he was 'fighting every day' on his way to recovery.

Over the weekend, Morgan won the latest round in his effort to sue Wal-Mart when a federal judge refused to delay legal action in the case

The ruling came on a motion by Kevin Roper, the driver of the Wal-Mart truck.

Roper, of Georgia, isn't named as a defendant but is facing criminal charges. He wanted the suit delayed until his criminal case was resolved.

Wal-Mart has previously denied claims that it was trying to stall the suit brought by the former Saturday Night Live, who was returning from a performance in Delaware when the accident occurred.

Morgan's attorney, Benedict Morelli, has said Morgan is fighting to recover from a traumatic brain injury suffered in the crash and is uncertain if he will be 'the Tracy Morgan he once was.'

Morgan currently can be seen on the big screen in Chris Rock's new comedy Top Five, which was filmed before the June accident.

A preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board said Roper was driving 65mph in the 60 seconds before he slammed into the van. The speed limit on that stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike is 55mph and was lowered to 45mph that night because of construction.

Morgan spent almost two months in the hospital and rehab following the accident before he could return home, and the extent of his brain injury is still unknown.

'He's fighting to get better, and if there's a chance for him to be back to the Tracy Morgan he once was, he's going to try to do that,' said his lawyer Benedict Morelli last month. 

'But we just don't know because of the severity of the injuries that he sustained and the fact that he had such a severe brain injury.'

The actor did appear much better than the last time he was spotted back in October being pushed in a wheelchair. 

Recovering: Tracy Morgan was seen in public for just the third time since being involved in a fatal car crash this past June

Heartbreaking: The usually gregarious Morgan was quiet and appeared weak as he slowly moved with his walker

Earlier this month, Morgan and his attorneys accused Wal-Mart of stalling in a federal lawsuit that have brought against the company over their safety practices after it was reported that Roper was asleep at the wheel at the time of the crash.

Following the incident, Roper took to Twitter to deny claims he was under the influence at the time of the accident, saying; 'I was never charged at the scene of the accident because once again i was not guilty of any crime. Not until all the TV cameras came.'

The Georgia resident also stated that he felt 'horrible' and 'wished it was him who was hurt' before writing; 'So yes i am now most likely f****d because i had an unfortunate ACCIDENT with the wrong car that night.' 

Legal victory: On Friday, a federal judge refused to delay Morgan's lawsuit against Wal-Mart. The ruling came on a motion by truck driver Kevin Roper (pictured in court in June)

Charged: The driver of the tractor-trailer that hit Morgan has been charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto

Morgan was forced to put an FX series he had in development on hold after the accident,

He came out against Wal-Mart in a public statement this past September after they accused him of being at fault during the accident for not wearing a seat belt.

'I can't believe Walmart is blaming me for an accident they caused,' he said at the time. 

'I'm fighting hard every day to get back.'
