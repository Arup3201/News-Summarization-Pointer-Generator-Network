Driving off a crowded Cornish beach after teaching disabled children to surf, Mark Hill found his path blocked by hundreds of holidaymakers – and with the tide rushing in.

He activated his lights, sounded sirens and used his vehicle’s PA system to urge people to move.

But the more noise he made, the more people swarmed around the Land Rover and trailer to see what was going on.

Holding on tight: Mark Hill can be seen clinging to his trailer by Towan Beach in Newquay after it got caught up in the incoming tide

Some belligerent tourists even clambered on to the vehicle and stared at him, refusing to budge.

Realising he was trapped Mr Hill freed
the trailer, which went floating out to sea within minutes. But he was 
unable to drive the Land Rover away and it was engulfed on the beach by 
the tide.

Mr Hill, 38, swam out to the trailer –
packed with vital equipment for his not-for-profit surf school – and 
climbed on top of it until it was towed back to shore by a fishing 
vessel.

But that was only the beginning of  his tale of woe, which unfolded at  Towan Beach in Newquay on Wednesday afternoon.

An RNLI lifeboat and other vessels surround the stranded trailer by Towan Beach in Newquay yesterday

Sticky situation: Mr Hill claims tourists on the beach prevented him from moving his trailer in time to avoid the incoming tide - leaving him with no choice but to detach it from his truck and let it drift out to sea

Ransacked: Mr Hill's submerged Land Rover which couldn't be recovered until the low tide came in this morning when it had already been looted by snorkelers overnight

Good timing: A passing fishing trawler spots Mr Hill on his trailer as it drifts further and further out to sea

Determined: The fishing vessel and another boat come to Mr Hill's aid as he refuses to let his trailer disappear into the ocean

He had been unable to save the Land 
Rover because although he had sand mats and a winch system that might 
have allowed him to drive it off the beach, he decided not to use the 
equipment because of the risk of injuring onlookers.

The inshore lifeboat’s attempt to tow the submerged vehicle failed.

Then at 10pm on Wednesday Mr Hill 
received a phone call to tell him that snorkellers were looting the Land
Rover. ‘It was tourists, or should I say opportunists,’ he said 
yesterday.

Rescue: The fishing vessel towed Mr Hill and his trailer in to the harbour in Newquay

Coming ashore: Mr Hill and his trailer pictured being towed towards the shore. Unfortunately the RNLI couldn't move his Land Rover which was also submerged until the tide went out this morning

‘We all know each other around here and it’s a very small community, so it wasn’t local residents.’

Around £2,000 worth of wetsuits, 
tools, surfboards and equipment were stolen from the Land Rover which is
a write-off. The looters vanished before police arrived.

‘They weren’t stealing from me, they 
were stealing from people less fortunate than themselves, from disabled 
children and adults,’ said Mr Hill, who is the director of Freedom Surf 
and has been teaching disadvantaged and disabled youngsters to surf for 
seven years.

However, his plight has brought a 
generous response from strangers and Mail Online readers, who have 
offered equipment and cash, including one offer of £500. ‘The response 
has been amazing,’ he said. ‘It has restored my faith in human nature.’

Ordeal: While Mr Hill managed to get his trailer back to shore relatively undamaged, his Land Rover was looted overnight before he had a chance to retrieve it

Help at hand: Mr Hill prepares to jump off his trailer as members of RNLI come to assist him to shore

Safe at last: The trailer was safely brought ashore in Newquay yesterday with remarkably little damage after being washed out to sea
