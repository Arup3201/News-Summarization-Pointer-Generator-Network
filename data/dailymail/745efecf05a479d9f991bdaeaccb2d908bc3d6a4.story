If you've had an uncomfortable festive season punctuated by rows, then watch out!

Today is the day people are most likely to start an affair - and the tensions of the Christmas period are partly to blame.

Traffic on married dating websites shoots up by 25 per cent on 7 January, new research has revealed.

Exciting: The thrill of an illicit affair can prove to be too much of a temptation for some, especially after a stressful Christmas, with sites such as illicitencounters.com reporting a 25 per cent surge in new members

What's more, Christmas tension isn't the
only factor leading people astray, with the survey also pinpointing Seasonal Affective Disorder (S.A.D) - a 
psychological condition that can lead to depression - as one of the root causes of adultery.

With more than one in five Brits believed to suffer from the condition, effects can include withdrawing from husbands and wives, as well as feeling dissatisfied with life.

'The beginning of the year is seen by many people as a new dawn and a time to start afresh,' says Marilyn Stowe, Senior Partner at Stowe Family Law - the UK's largest family law firm.

'The effect of the December break shouldn’t be underestimated either.

'When there are already difficulties within a household, Christmas can become an exhausting, miserable slog, which ratchets the pressure up to unbearable levels.

'Come January, something has to give.'

As a result, many look outside their relationships for a fling or distraction to take their mind off marital problems.

But, says psychotherapist and relationship counsellor, Mark Maitland, playing away can have a devastating effect on your marriage.

'Most relationships don't survive an affair,' he warns.

'The betrayal is damaging to the intimate bond [between partners] causing a wound that never really heals.'

'If you’re thinking of cheating on your partner it’s a clear sign that you need to have a long, hard think about your relationship,' adds Katie Fox, relationship expert at sex toy website, bondara.co.uk.

'Why do you want to cheat? Is it purely sexual attraction to another person who isn’t your partner or do you have romantic feelings for them?

'If the love is gone from your relationship and you’re looking for a sexual and romantic relationship with someone else then it’s time to think about whether it’s time to end things and move on.

'Splitting up with someone is always hard but cheating on them will only make things more complicated and painful when they eventually find out.'

Worried that he's not being entirely truthful about his new colleague? Harley Street sex and relationship expert Louise Van der Velde, a TV regular who has provided relationship advice on ITV1's Lorraine and Channel 5's Tricia shows, reveals the top five things to look out for. 1. Intuition: You instinctively know they are behaving differently and something is not right with the relationship.2. Dressing differently: The cheating partner takes much more care over their appearance - dressing more provocatively and, if female, pays far more attention to make-up and hair.3. Changing sexual behaviour: This can go one of two ways: they go off sex completely with their regular partner or, occasionally, they want MORE sex at home because the affair makes the cheat more sexually active.4. Becoming hard to reach: You can't get in touch with the cheat on the phone and they change their passwords to their social media sites and mobile phone.5. Spending more time in the office: They spend more time at work or are increasingly busy with other engagements.
