Boca Juniors want Southampton striker Dani Osvaldo. 

The 28-year-old is on loan at Inter Milan and has scored six goals in 13 games.

He joined Southampton for £12.6million but spent part of last season on loan at Juventus while Inter have an option to make the deal permanent after this loan.

Boca have been watching Osvaldo though and that will suit Southampton as they look to instigate an auction for the striker.

Osvaldo's last goal came in Inter's 4-2 defeat against Roma as Roberto Mancini's side sit 11th in Serie A.

Sportsmail reported in September that Osvaldo has no intention of returning to Southampton with the club-record signing keen to complete a move elsewhere.
