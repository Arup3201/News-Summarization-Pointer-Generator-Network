Families of the Omagh bombing victims said yesterday that human rights laws favour 'killer gangs'.

They spoke out after two Real IRA terrorists won the latest round of their European court fight to escape paying damages.

Michael McKevitt and Liam Campbell were ordered to pay a share of £1.6million in aggravated damages after a landmark civil action found them liable for the 1998 atrocity.

But their lawyers have persuaded officials at the European Court of Human Rights to put their case to have the order overturned before judges.

It was revealed yesterday that the Government must now formally respond to their case after they passed an important filtering stage designed to weed out invalid cases.

Families of those murdered when the car bomb exploded in the Northern Irish market town said they were outraged by the decision.

Michael Gallagher, whose 21-year-old son Aiden was killed in the blast, said the development was a 'psychological blow' and called for the law to be urgently reformed.

'There seems to be no effective law for giving rights to victims,' he said. 'The human rights laws to me would need to be looked at again.

'It has always favoured the killer gangs and organisations and never the victims. It's always weighted on the side of the perpetrator and this news is extremely disappointing.'

Mr Gallagher told a Sunday newspaper: 'We are still working under human rights law formed many years ago to deal with the Nazis in Germany post-Second World War and what seems to be happening since the 1970s is terrorism, is the new Nazism, and there has been no effective human rights legislation focused on the victims.'

The decision of terrorists to turn to controversial human rights legislation again highlights Europe's influence over the British legal system.

They are following in the footsteps of many foreign criminals who have attempted to use the law to escape deportation.

The Omagh bombing, in which 29 people and unborn twins died and hundreds more were injured, was the worst single terrorist attack of the Troubles. The Real IRA admitted responsibility, but no one was ever successfully prosecuted in the criminal courts.

However, after a fighting fund was launched by the Daily Mail, grieving families brought an unprecedented civil action and won their first victory at the High Court in Belfast in 2009. McKevitt, Campbell and fellow Republicans Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly, were ordered to pay damages but embarked on a lengthy appeal process.

In January last year, it emerged that McKevitt, 64, and Campbell, 52, had taken their case to the Strasbourg court in a final attempt to escape paying up.

McKevitt is serving a 20-year jail sentence imposed in 2003 by a court in Dublin for IRA membership and directing terrorism.

Campbell, a fellow dissident Republican, was jailed for eight years by the same court in 2004 for IRA membership.

Their lawyers claim their rights were breached under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights – the right to a fair trial – which has been incorporated into British law by the Human Rights Act. The argument focuses on the decision to allow hearsay evidence from FBI agent David Rupert, who infiltrated dissident Republican terrorist groups.

Earlier this month Daly, 43, appeared at Dungannon Magistrates' Court charged with 29 counts of murder over Omagh.

Stanley McComb, whose wife Ann died in the blast, said of McKevitt and Campbell's move: 'Those b******* will go to any length and any extreme. It's all just a cynical exercise for them.

'These guys are just terrorists, murderers and yet they can get all the support they need to get this into a European court. What is wrong with the judicial system that is allowing this to happen? This is all a moneymaking exercise for the legal profession too.'
