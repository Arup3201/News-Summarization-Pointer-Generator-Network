Speeding driver: Shiad Mahmoon, 24, was clocked doing an average speed of up to 165mph

A driver sentenced to a three-year ban after speeding at 165mph told a court: ‘I’m still going to drive – catch me if you can.’

Shiad Mahmoon, 24, was hurtling down a motorway in a high-performance rented Audi R8 Spyder when he was caught.

A police helicopter spotted the car racing down the middle lane at 5am and followed it as it veered off at a junction and on to another motorway.

Officers filmed the car from above and worked out Mahmoon was travelling at an average speed of between 144mph and 165mph – though police believe he could have been travelling faster at one point.

A patrol car was radioed and a chase culminated with Mahmoon pulling over on the M62 near a service station. It is believed 165mph is the second-highest speed ever recorded by police in the UK.

Appearing before magistrates in Liverpool, Mahmoon pleaded guilty to driving at excess speed on the motorway.

Defending himself, he claimed he had no recollection of the early morning incident because he had suffered a brain injury which affected his memory.

The court heard Mahmoon, of Oldham, had previous convictions for driving while disqualified and driving without due care and attention. He was also previously found guilty of possessing cannabis with intent to supply.

Magistrate Christina Clarke told him: ‘We recognise the serious risk of danger you put yourself and other road users in and we are informed that this is the highest recorded speed by Merseyside Police.’

Magistrates banned Mahmoon from driving for three years and ordered him to take a driving test before he is allowed back on the road. He was also told to pay fines and costs of £515. When asked if he could pay the full amount immediately, he put his hand in his pocket and replied sarcastically: ‘I’m about £10 short.’

Unemployed Mahmoon shrugged off the road ban as he stepped down from the dock, saying: ‘I’m still going to drive – catch me if  you can.’

Last night anti-crime campaigners slammed magistrates for failing to punish the driver for contempt of court for the comment. Ellen Booth, of charity Brake, said: Driving at 165mph down a motorway is incredibly dangerous and potentially deadly at any time of the day or night. A driver travelling at that speed cannot pre-empt what hazards may be just around the corner and it is a very irresponsible act.’

‘His boast about continuing to drive is shocking and shows the contempt he has for the law and police need to ensure this is followed up on so he is not allowed to wilfully flout his driving ban.’

A spokesman for Families Against Crime 
said: ‘He should have been hauled over the coals for a comment like that
 and charged with contempt of court.

Stopped: The driver eventually pulled over after a high-speed police pursuit, Liverpool Magistrates' Court was told

‘The driver is a disgrace and I only hope he doesn’t get behind the wheel of a car again because he is a bomb waiting to go off.’ The incident happened in Merseyside in June 2011 when Mahmoon was spotted speeding in the lease car on the M57.

Sergeant Mike Clarey, who later pulled him over on the M62, said: ‘Travelling at such a high speed put Mahmoon in danger and also could have put other drivers in danger. Mahmoon showed a blatant disregard for the law even after he was sentenced.

‘Our message to anyone who flouts the law to such a degree is that we will use all the technology we have available to bring you to justice.’

In 2007 Timothy Brady, 33, of  Harrow, was jailed for ten weeks after pleading guilty at Oxford Crown Court to speeding at 172mph in a Porsche 911 Turbo in a 70mph zone on the A420.

The driver was caught doing one of the highest speeds ever recorded on Britain's road.

An average speed of between 144mph and 165mph raises the possibility that he was going even faster for a short distance.

Daniel
 Nicks, then 34, became Britain's fastest ever driver when he was caught
 doing 175mph on a Honda Fireblade motorbike in Hertfordshire in 2000.

And Porsche 911 driver Timothy Brady, 33, was clocked doing 172mph on an A-road in Oxfordshire in January 2007.

Motorcyclist Fred Bowden, 42, was recorded doing 170mph on a Kawasaki ZX10-R bike in Cornwall in 2008.
