A TV actress and model has been left scarred for life after she was glassed on the anniversary of her daughter’s death.

Yvette Gill, 31, was left with a fractured jaw and needing plastic surgery to treat a deep facial wound following the random attack.

Police have released CCTV footage of 
the man suspected of launching the brutal and unprovoked assault in 
Westgate, Bradford, on April 1 shortly 
after midnight.

Wounded: Yvette Gill suffered a deep gash to the side of her head, left, which required extensive plastic surgery, right, after being smashed across the face by a man in a random attack

And despite months of recovery and treatment, the actress - who played Cindy in The Body Farm and also starred in other TV programmes, including Coronation Street, DCI Banks and Mount Pleasant - is still having trouble opening her mouth to eat and yawn.

Miss Gill had
been out for a couple of drinks with her brother and his girlfriend, to take her 
mind off the anniversary of the death of her daughter Maria who died five days after being born prematurely in 2009, when they were confronted by a man wielding a bottle. 

Miss Gill said: 'The
anniversaries are always hard, and my mum had suggested it would take 
my mind off things to go to her pub for a couple of hours, instead of 
being sat at home on my own.'

After leaving the pub, they were walking through the city centre and noticed a man 'hassling' some girls in a phone box.

'We
said something like "leave the lasses alone mate" and carried on 
walking up Westgate,' said Miss Gill.

'We turned round and saw the guy 
had crossed on to our side of the road and was holding a bottle.

'My
brother, Wayne, shouted "get away mate" but he carried on walking 
towards him holding the bottle by its neck, and swinging it. I said to 
Wayne "just leave it and we’ll go".

'The guy looked at me and the next 
thing I heard what sounded like a bomb going off in my ear and the whole
bottle just disintegrated.

'The bloke ran off and my brother started chasing him, but his girlfriend called him back, saying I had been badly injured.'

Vicious: Actress and model Yvette Gill, pictured, has been scared for life as a result of the attack

Miss Gill was taken to hospital where she had plastic surgery and more than 15 stitches inserted in the wound.

But
months after the incident, Miss Gill returned to Bradford Royal 
Infirmary for CT and MRI scans, which revealed her jaw was broken.

Miss
Gill said: 'They told me they would have to open up the side of my face
from the ear lobe and I would have to have physiotherapy for the rest 
of my life. And they couldn’t rule out that my jaw wasn’t cracked or 
broken in another place until they operated.

'It’s
traumatic. I will have to take a month off work and I won’t be able to 
watch my son, who has just signed a scholarship for Huddersfield Town, 
play his football matches.'

Fame: Ms Gill has starred in a host of TV programmes, such as DCI Banks, The Body Farm, Mount Pleasant, and Coronation Street

Speaking about her attacker she added: 'This guy is very dangerous. He brutally attacked a woman. He can’t be allowed to walk the streets.

'This could have been worse. Anyone who knows this man needs to do the right thing and bring him to justice. He could do this again.'

A police spokesman said nobody had been arrested.

The suspect looked tanned, was in his 30s, of medium build, 5ft7-9ins, with thick medium-length dark hair. He was wearing blue jeans and a brown hooded top.
