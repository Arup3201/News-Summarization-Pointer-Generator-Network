The Pittsburgh Zoo has found a unique way to keep its mammoth African elephants in line when a human being can't do the job, and that's a pair of 25-pound Australian cattle dogs.

Major and Zeta are the zoo's secret weapon, giving staff an important safety buffer when dealing with the giant animals.

'It
 was a safety issue initially around some dangerous animals and the dogs
 just kind of fit right into there,' Willie Theisen, the elephant 
manager at the Pittsburgh Zoo, told reporters. 'They were an extra piece to the puzzle 
and helped out immensely.'

At the Pittsburgh Zoo, dogs Major and Zeta have made a name for themselves by becoming great elephant herders

Keeping the mammoth African elephants can be dangerous business without a safety zone like the one the dog's provide, said zoo officials

As the dogs are bred to move livestock, herding the elephants comes naturally to them.

'If you are dealing with say a dangerous animal, it kind of gives you
 that added advantage (to know), 'The elephant's not so focused on me,'' Theisen told CBS News. 'Now, the elephants have to watch that dog to see what 
they are going to do, so that they are going to become actually more 
responsive to me.'

So respected are the brave canines that the elephants will perk up if they even hear a handler call one of their names.

With the dogs in the enclosure, elephants won't come within 25 yards of their keeper

They also become alerted upon hearing the dog's licenses jingle as they run around a corner.

Yet Theisen said the dogs are much more than simply a pair of aggressive guards, meeting children visiting the zoo with warm and loving welcomes.

'These dogs 
are actually love dogs. They would be would be great family dogs because
 when they are not working, they will go out, interact with the public. 
They love just being petted, and I mean, they are in heaven,' he said.

When they aren't herding elephants, the dogs love playing with children visiting the zoo

The practice of using dogs to herd zoo animals remains so rare Pittsburgh is the only facility in the Northern Hemisphere to use them.

'Other
 than the institute in Canada, I think we are one of the very few zoos 
that actually use them around the elephants,' Theisen said.

But Major and Zeta have been so successful other zoos are now visiting just to watch them work.

The dogs provide important safety. In 2002, keeper Mike Gatti was killed by a female elephant at the Pittsburgh zoo.Â 

Without the dogs present, CBS cameras captured the elephants walking over to Theisen to nuzzle him with their trunks. Besides providing security, the dogs help the elephants exercise.

A baby elephant even rolled onto her back on the ground alongside him.

Without safety precautions elephants commonly attack people and killed on man at the Pittsburgh Zoo in 2002

But when he walked in with the dogs, the elephants would give him a distance of at least 25 to 30 yards.

Unless Thiesen commanded the dogs to stay and walked away from them, he could not walk up close to the elephants.

'It's
 kind of like having a second set of eyes,' he said. 'Again, by 
watching the elephants, you can see they (the elephants) are more keyed 
on the dogs than they are on us.'
