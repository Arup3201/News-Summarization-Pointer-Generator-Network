'But that's up to my representatives and the club. I will stay if the club wants me to stay.

'I am not thinking about my future now. We will see what Madrid have in mind, whether they want me to stay or leave.'

The 26-year-old added: 'I am happy at Madrid. I had a great season and always had everybody's support.

'But sometimes you don't have a choice, even when you want to stay yourself.'

But one place Di Maria will not be going is to Arsenal's north London rivals Tottenham.

Referring to last summer, he added: 'Many things were said, sometimes you think a lot and it hurts you when you are trying to always do your best for a club and then it comes out that you might be going to Tottenham.'
