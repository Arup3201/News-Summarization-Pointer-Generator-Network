A colonel has ordered young officers to ‘sharpen up’ their appearance by dressing more like Princes William and Harry – and less like schoolboys from Grange Hill.

In an extensive email, Colonel Barry Jenkins of the Royal Artillery Regiment tells male officers to avoid cartoon character socks, the ‘silvery’ shirts worn by Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker and shoes with treads like ‘four-wheel drives’.

He informs female officers that their make-up should not be excessive and, ‘most importantly’, hair should be tidy and presentable, adding: ‘The whole “train crash survivor” clambering the embankment look is unattractive and inelegant.’

Do: Dress like Prince Harry out of uniform

Don't: Wear shirts like those of Gary Lineker

Instead, he advises his officers to follow the lead set by Princes William and Harry when they are in civilian clothes.

Colonel Jenkins says: ‘We should not ape the armed wing of Boden, Primark, Fat Face.

‘I am constantly amazed by what some think is acceptable dress.

‘It is not just the quality but the untidy, scruffy manner in which it is worn – this must sharpen up.’

The memo – which quickly swept the internet – advises officers to wear a ‘good, clean, well pressed suit’ with a Gunner zigzag tie for the men and a brooch for the women.

Support: Tory MP and former soldier Patrick Mercer applauded the email

He suggests a ‘slim elegant leather 
suit belt’ rather than a Harley Davidson-buckle belt and long socks that
‘do not show your flaky, spindly, hairy Twiglet-like shin’.

Then he reminds young officers of the importance of polished and good quality footwear.

He
says: ‘A heavy tread and a big fat square toe won’t do justice to your 
well-cut suit… you wouldn’t put ketchup on a Dover sole.’

Colonel Jenkins is particularly 
animated about the way in which young officers wear their zigzag style 
neck tie. He says: ‘The tie should be correctly tied, close to the 
collar and checked regularly.

‘The
knot must not be big fat Grange Hill special or be seen adorning the 
neck of a semi finalist from The Apprentice. The tie should just reach 
over the waist belt, not six inches above or below.’

Further
advice includes avoiding diving watches, which look ‘awful’ when 
‘furiously scrunched up against your shirt cuff’, and to steer clear of 
shirts with pockets or those in black, red or other ‘EMO’ colours, 
referring to the clothes worn by members of popular bands such as My 
Chemical Romance, which often include studded belts and black 
wristbands.

Colonel Jenkins asks Royal Artillery staff to: ‘Please disseminate this lick of polish on to our fantastic, brave and impressive cohort of young officers.’

Conservative MP and former Army colonel Patrick Mercer believes the advice from Colonel Jenkins should be ‘applauded’.

He said: ‘I know Barry Jenkins, he was a student of mine at staff college. He is a good bloke and I suspect if he is recommending that young Army officers should present themselves in a particular way, then it is good advice. I think increasingly in today’s society that the Army plays a part in being a role model for young people because of their sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan, therefore I think this is to be applauded.’

The memo has proved a hit with the Army. One officer said: ‘The colonel’s an absolute legend.’

Last night a Ministry of Defence spokesman said it was ‘aware’ of the email.
