Kenny Dalglish says Roy Keane was right not to shake Jose Mourinho's hand before the end of Chelsea's win over Aston Villa.

With just minutes remaining and his side 3-0 ahead at Stamford Bridge, the Chelsea boss headed for the exit and attempted to shake hands with Villa boss Paul Lambert and assistant Keane.

Both snubbed Mourinho's handshake request with Lambert pointing to his watch, suggesting that the Portuguese manager would have to wait until full-time.

Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert also refused to shake Mourinho's hand at Stamford Bridge 

Lambert couldn't understand why Mourinho was leaving the pitch before full-time

Dalglish told the Mirror: 'I probably wouldn’t have shaken his hand, either, if I had been in the same situation as the former United skipper.'

The former Liverpool forward added: 'Mourinho is at the top of the tree at the moment. You can get away with a lot of things when you’re in his position.

'But maybe he should remember the old adage about being nice to people on the way up because you might need them on the way down.'
