The 2013 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, wasn’t all about high-priced luxury gadgets.

A California-based mobile electronics company called SpareOne introduced an emergency low-powered cell phone that runs on a single AA cell battery, the most common battery in the world.

Users simply need to put one battery in the back of the phone and they can make calls for up to 10 hours.

Users can also put a SIM card into the phone in order to use their regular phone numbers to make calls.

First of its kind: The SpareOne is the world's only mobile phone powered by a single AA battery

SpareOne says the idea is not to replace any user’s smartphone. ‘This is meant to be an emergency and secondary phone for outdoor use or travel use,’ Christian Scheder, the president of SpareOne, told ABC News.

Scheder cited Hurricane Sandy as one reason consumers might want to have a spare phone around to make emergency calls.

The small cell phone, which has a shelf-life of up to 15 years, comes with a waterproof bag.

There is a large emergency button on the phone for users who need to call 911 and no SIM card is required to make those calls. There is also a flashlight on the top of the phone, which provides 24 hours of light.

SpareOne additionally makes a smartphone app that can track people's locations during emergencies.

The SpareOne emergency cell phone is on sale now for $99.99 and comes in red and white.
