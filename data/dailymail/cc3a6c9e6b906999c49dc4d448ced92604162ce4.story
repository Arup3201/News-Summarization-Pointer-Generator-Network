Popular: Doug Ferguson was described by one friend as a 'fantastic doctor, funny man and intellectual'

A medical student who died after falling ill at an all-night party may have taken a ‘legal high’ drug, it emerged last night.

Doug Ferguson, 19, was celebrating the end of his university year when he started to feel unwell.

His friends called 999 in the early hours of the morning and he was taken to hospital, but doctors were unable to save him.

One theory being considered by police is that he took a legal high called AMT, which can be bought cheaply online.

Users experience a state of euphoria and increased energy levels. But the drug has devastating side effects, including paranoia and aggressive behaviour.

The party took place at the home of Mr Ferguson’s friend Alex Pearson, 19, while his parents were away on holiday.

The £500,000 detached house is close to the dead student’s family home in the affluent village of Chandler’s Ford in Hampshire.Last night a neighbour said that Mr Pearson regularly held house parties. He said that on one occasion last year residents had to call the police after 100 teenagers turned up.

Yesterday Mr Ferguson’s family paid tribute to their ‘fun-loving’ son who ‘lived life to the full’. In a statement issued by the police they said: ‘We will all greatly miss him and are deeply saddened that his life should end while he was so young with what should have been a great future ahead of him.

'Talented': Mr Ferguson was a trainee doctor at the University of Bristol

‘His sudden and unexpected death will
leave a large hole in our hearts and in our family.’

The student 
attended Thornden School near his home and then gained A-grades in his 
A-levels at Peter Symonds  College in Winchester.

He had just finished the second year of a medical degree at the University of Bristol when he died.

Friend Manny Singh Dulay, who was not at the party, said Mr Ferguson had ‘never been the kind of person to take drugs’.

The 18-year-old, who is currently 
studying medicine at King’s College London, said: ‘Doug had always 
wanted to be a doctor. He had his heart set on it and wanted to be an 
anaesthetist.

‘He was incredibly bright and could 
recall a fact in a second. He had a natural talent and he was brilliant 
with people.

'Doug did voluntary work at Southampton General Hospital. It
was just simple tasks like asking patients what they wanted to eat.

‘Some students just do it to look 
good but Doug genuinely loved it. He loved talking to people.’

Another 
friend said that Mr Pearson, a student at Brunel University, had 
frantically sent texts to his friends at 6.30am asking them to come 
round to the house.

He said his friend was ‘really not well’ and that he
was worried.

The 20-year-old friend, who did not 
want to be named, said: ‘People think it is OK to take them [legal 
highs], but it’s not. Doug was a very bright guy, and he would have 
thought twice about taking any drugs if he knew they were illegal.’

Yesterday Mr Pearson’s parents Renfrey and Katherine refused to say if they had allowed the party to take place at their home.

Mrs Pearson said: ‘Alex and Doug were good friends. It is tragic. We are in mourning.’

Maryon Stewart, whose medical student
daughter Hester died three years ago after taking party drug GBL, said:
‘This makes me want to howl. Chemists are able to drop all these drugs 
on the market to make a profit. It leaves our children vulnerable.’

Police have been unable to determine 
the exact cause of Mr Ferguson’s death because toxicology tests have 
been inconclusive. A 19-year-old man and a 17-year-old youth have been 
arrested and bailed on suspicion of supplying controlled drugs.
