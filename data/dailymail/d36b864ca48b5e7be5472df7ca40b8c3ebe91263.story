A win at Manchester City and a home defeat by Leicester: Mark Hughes must wonder about this strange game sometimes.

His sense of bemusement will only be heightened by the way his side battered Leicester in the first half but coughed up all the points to a Leonardo Ulloa goal in the second.

Certainly the arrival of Esteban Cambiasso at half-time helped the promoted side. He is 34 but lacks little in class, even if the motor that won him 23 European and domestic trophies is a touch worn.

His willingness to direct a side lacking in top-level experience was impressive; his timeless ability to ping passes and set pieces with his left foot even more so. 

Combined, his skills helped settle a team unadventurous in the first half but which left with their first Barclays Premier League win.

‘They probably think they created enough chances to win,’ said Leicester manager Nigel Pearson. ‘Whether we deserved to win is, in some ways, irrelevant. 

'We stayed in the game but the changes at half-time certainly allowed us to get a bit more control. Cambiasso’s game management is exceptional. He has not been the success he has in his career without qualities away from the ball, in terms of organisation. He was a very important influence.’

But this was largely about Stoke’s failings. They controlled much of the game, having 60 per cent of the possession and 24 shots.That only four of those shots were on target says plenty. ‘We needed something to drop and it didn’t,’ Hughes said. 

‘I thought we handled the first half well, put any number of crosses in the box, but didn’t have the luck.’

Stoke started well. Steven Nzonzi dragged a shot wide after 10 minutes and moments later Peter Crouch missed the chance of the half with a header from six yards.

Ben Hamer — in for Kasper Schmeichel, whose knee injury ended a streak of 141 league starts — spilled a cross from Jonathan Walters but wasn’t punished.

Cambiasso came on at half-time and quickly created a chance with a left-footed through-ball that was inches from putting Ulloa clear.

Ulloa started and finished the move that led to his winner, rolling a pass to Danny Drinkwater on the edge of Stoke’s area before surging on. Drinkwater played in Paul Konchesky on the left and his low cross appeared to be going behind Ulloa, who twisted and turned the ball in.

Jonathan Walters wasted a chance to level after 71 minutes by running into traffic and losing possession before Hamer made two good close-range saves from Mame Diouf and Victor Moses.
