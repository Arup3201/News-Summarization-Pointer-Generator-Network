An escaped convict carried out a string of robberies after he was given day release from prison - to go on 'work experience'.

Nicholas Overton, 35, had been branded a 'significant risk to the public' by a judge when he was locked away for 18 years for a string of raids in 2006.

But just seven years into his stretch, Overton was allowed out for the day from HMP Thorn Cross in Warrington, Cheshire to complete a work placement at the Chester branch of photo printing firm Max Spielman as part of a prison 'back to work' scheme.

When the store closed for the day, Overton disappeared with the £1,500 takings and went on a knifepoint robbery spree across the county plus neighbouring Staffordshire.

Nine shop premises including off licences, newsagents and supermarkets were raided by Overton in August as police tried to track him down.

The fugitive - originally from Sheffield, South Yorkshire - was eventually recaptured last month in a dawn swoop on a house in Crewe after being at large for 28 days.

This week at Chester Crown Court, Overton pleaded guilty to three robberies and asked for six other raids to be considered.

He will be sentenced on October 28 following the preparation of pre-sentence reports and he was remanded in custody.

Overton had originally received an 18-year sentence at Sheffield Crown Court in 2006 for 23 gunpoint robberies carried out upon shops across five counties over a two-month period.

He and an accomplice Nigel Beever, then 37, were said to have got a 'sick thrill' from their crimes.

Their total haul was just £8,500 but victims traumatised by the raids were too afraid to return to work.

The men were caught after their getaway car was spotted in Sheffield.

South Yorkshire Police at the time described their crime spree as a 'particularly protracted and worrying series of armed robberies.'

One officer said they got 'more confident and brazen and weren’t going to stop until they were caught' and 'clearly enjoyed what they were doing.'

Several victims thought they were going to be shot and were in fear for their lives.

Overton had previous convictions for 
theft, deception, possessing heroin, perverting the course of justice, 
burglary, and a knifepoint robbery.

Beever was jailed for 14 years for robbery and possession of a firearm.

At
the time Judge Roger Keen QC said the public was at ‘significant risk 
of serious psychological harm’ from Overton re-offending and ordered he 
should serve at least eight-and-a-half years before being considered for
parole.

But Overton was 
later sent to the 321 inmate Thorn Cross open jail where prison 
'accommodation' consists of single rooms, with each prisoner having his 
own room key.

Overton was 
then allowed out on August 23 as part of the jail’s partnership with 
national and local employers, offering opportunities for work placements
prior to and on release.

He was due back at the jail that night after a day working at the shop but the alarm was raised when he failed to report back to prison staff.

During the operation to recapture Overton, a 38-year old woman was arrested and bailed pending further inquiries.

Today Det Sgt Dam Ackerley of Cheshire Police said: 'Overton is clearly a very dangerous individual. The public can feel relieved that he is off the streets.

'He isn’t your normal prolific criminal. He is quite well educated and articulate and didn’t have obsvious dependencies.'

He added: 'Overton’s arrest was the result of some sterling work across the various CID teams and units. It had has been a proper team effort which resulted in Overton being charged.

'We were the ones who got him and put him before the court. We said we would get him and we have done.'

A Prison Service spokesman said: 'Release on temporary licence is used to prepare prisoners for their eventual release from custody.

'We fully support the police in their investigation and we are examining the circumstances of this case to identify any lessons that can be learned.'
