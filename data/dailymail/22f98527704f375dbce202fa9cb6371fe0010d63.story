Police arrested hundreds of people who strapped themselves to the White House fence on Sunday to protest the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline.

The protesters were mostly college students who participated in a peaceful march that began at Georgetown University and ended outside the White House.

They chanted 'climate justice now' and carried signs with slogans such as 'don't tarnish the earth' in an effort to persuade President Barack Obama to reject the pipeline.

Chained: 372 of the protesters were arrested when they strapped themselves to the White House fence

Others wore white jumpsuits splatterd with blood while laying down on Pennsylvania Avenue in a simulated oil spill.

Protesters were passionate but quite orderly. Police were waiting for them with buses and vans to speed the process.

Protesters cheered as U.S. Park Police warned them that blocking the sidewalk or strapping themselves to the fence would lead to their arrest. In all, 372 were arrested, police said. Organizers estimate that about 1,000 people participated in the protest overall.

The protesters were speaking out against the $5.4billion pipeline being proposed by Canadian energy firm TransCanada Corp.

If built, the pipeline will transport crude oil from Alberta to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

It's currently under review by the State Department and other agencies, but President Obama has a final say on whether it gets approved.

Climate change: The protesters believe the proposed pipeline will worsen global warming

Those against he pipeline fear it will cause oil spills and hasten climate change - which has led to much protesting outside the White House.

'If the Democratic Party wants to keep our vote, they better make sure President Obama rejects that pipeline,' said Nick Stracco, a 23-year-old student at Tulane University in New Orleans.

Supporters for the pipeline however, believe it will be good for the U.S. economy by creating thousands of temporary construction jobs and improving energy security.

'Today's protest represents a fringe minority of people against any use of fossil fuels,' said Matt Dempsey of Oil Sands Fact Check. 'This extreme position is well outside the American mainstream. Even President Obama says we need an "all of the above" approach to energy. As a result, today's protest does little but expose the extreme nature of these last remaining Keystone XL opponents.'
