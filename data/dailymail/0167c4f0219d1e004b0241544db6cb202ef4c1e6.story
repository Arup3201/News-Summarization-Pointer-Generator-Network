A southern Indiana woman who prosecutors say gunned down a Kentucky man during a sexual role-playing game has been sentenced to 45 years in prison.

Lisa Shuler, 32, of New Albany, apologized during a hearing Wednesday in a Floyd County courtroom for shooting and killing 49-year-old Charles Pierce of Louisville, last fall.

Shuler said she brought shame to her own family and hurt Pierce’s family.

Act of contrition: Shuler apologized in court for the pain she caused to the victim's family and to her own loved ones

‘I know I can’t take away their hurt or pain,’ she said during a brief statement. She pleaded guilty to murder in January.

Shuler allegedly first told 911 dispatchers that Pierce was a home intruder. Later, however, she told investigators that she and Pierce had been involved in a kinky role play after they found 200 deleted texts on her phone.

She also tried to delete texts from Pierce's phone when she called 911.

According to an affidavit, Shuler finished performing a sex act and then pulled a gun from a holster on her belt and fired the weapon until it was empty.

Investigators found the man, pants down, had been shot multiple times with a .45-caliber handgun at close range. He was rushed to a hospital, but died a short time later.

Chief Deputy Prosecutor Steven Owen said Shuler feared Pierce intended to pass photos of them having sex on to her estranged husband and that the killing was premeditated.

Owen read a statement by Pierce’s mother, Mildred Pierce, during the hearing, as the elderly woman was too overcome with emotion to speak, the News and Tribune.

‘I lost my youngest son,’ the mother of three said in the statement. ‘The hole that has been left cannot ever be filled.

‘He was always coming over and I still expect to hear the back door open and to hear him holler, “Mom.” He lived next door to me. Every time I go out on the deck, there’s his house.’

Shuler’s grandmother, Iretta Michael, said the murder should never have taken place.

‘If it hadn’t been for drugs, alcohol and perverse sex, neither one of them would be lost,’ she said.

She added that the 32-year-old woman was raised by a loving family in a Christian home, 'but chose to go the other way.'

‘She is going to pay 45 years, and we have lost her,’ Michael told the station WLKY.

Appearing in court Wednesday dressed in a green striped jumpsuit with her hands shackled, Shuler took the microphone to address the relatives of the victim.

‘I apologize to the family,’ Shuler said. ‘I know I can’t take away their hurt or pain.'

Charles Pierce’s grief-stricken mother, who suffers from breast cancer, spoke after the sentencing, saying that Shuler's apology did not ring true, and that only a life term in prison would have satisfied her.

What started out as a sexual escapade ended in Charles Pierce's death on the night of May 6, 2013.

According to his mother, the 49-year-old told her that he was going out and planned to visit her later that night of the following morning. He never made it back.

Police say Pierce drove to Shuler's home on Wabash Avenue, where the two engaged in 'rape fantasy' role play.

According to the affidavit, Shuler began to perform a sex act on him, and once she was done, she pulled a .45 caliber handgun and fire on her sex partner until the clip was empty.

The woman then called 911 to report that she shot a man who had tried to break into her home.

Officers who arrived on the scene found Pierce lying on the floor riddled with bullets. His pants and underwear were pulled down to his knees.

During questioning, Shuler changed her home invasion story, admitting that she shot Pierce because he was in possession of photos depicting their previous sexual encounter, which the married woman feared would fall into the hands of her husband of 10 years, Brandon. 

According to her Facebook page, Shuler worked at a medical office. Her estranged husband owns a guitar shop.

Her final post appeared on her account on the morning of the murder.

In the message, Shuler uploaded a picture of a man at prayer and quoted Isaiah 12:2: 'Surely God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid. The LORD, the LORD, is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation.'
