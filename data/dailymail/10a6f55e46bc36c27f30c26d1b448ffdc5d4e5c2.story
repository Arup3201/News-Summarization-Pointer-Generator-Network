Some of Britain's hottest acting talent has come together to support Stand Up to Cancer in a dramatic short film.

Tom Hardy, Benedict Cumberbatch, Michelle Dockery, Gillian Anderson, Idris Elba, Eddie Redmayne, Anna Friel, Sheridan Smith and Steve Coogan star in the exclusive film by renowned photographer and film director, Greg Williams.

The idea is to demonstrate the need for urgency in the fight against cancer, so the film features each A- list star running defiantly towards the camera.

A semi-dressed Tom Hardy runs through the street in his dressing gown; Idris Elba sprints to escape a street explosion; Anna Friel speeds through an office; Steve Coogan hops over a wall and Gillian Anderson careers towards the camera holding her shoes.

Between the dramatic shots, there are cut-aways featuring portraits of cancer patients who are also supporting the Stand Up To Cancer campaign.

Greg Williams said: 'It's been an honour to be involved in the Stand Up To Cancer campaign. I lost my mum to cancer, something I feel strongly that no one should ever have to experience. 

'By making this film and collection of images, I've been able to help to bring Stand Up To Cancer's vital work to the fore and help build momentum in the fight against cancer.'
