A passenger who used his brute strength to wrench open gates at a tube station is being hunted by police.

The man was caught on CCTV having an ‘Incredible Hulk’ moment at London Victoria station as he pulled the gates out of the ground and bent them apart before creeping inside.

He was told the station was closed for cleaning but ignored staff   as he forced his way inside.

The passenger was seen using his brute strength to wrench open the gates at London Victoria tube station

He was caught on CCTV as he pulled the gates from the ground, bent the metal apart and forced his way in 

The man had been told by staff that the station was closed for cleaning but ignoring them he damaged gate

The footage shows the man, who is wearing dark clothing, pointing and shouting at a station worker.

Seconds after the member of staff walks away, he shakes the gate before wrenching it apart and ducking inside, as passengers look on.

The man is now wanted by the British Transport Police, who say he tried entering the station a few hours after England played Uruguay in the World Cup - at about 2am on June 20.

PC Stephen Webster said: ‘After he was refused entry, the man managed to force his way into the station by pulling the gates out of the ground and bending them.

‘We believe the man shown in the CCTV footage has important information about this incident, and urge anyone who knows who he is to contact us.’

Anyone with information on this incident should contact British Transport Police on 0800 405040.

His actions have been compared to the Incredible Hulk - the strong creature based on Marvel Comics character
