Asda, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Marks & Spencer wines have been given the stamp of approval by more than 300 wine experts.

In fact tipples from four supermarket tipples were considered the best to pair with Christmas meals this festive season. 

Asda Extra Special El Meson Rioja Gran Reserva 2004 is perfect with roast turkey while vegetarians can pair their nut roast with Marks & Spencer Manzanilla Sherry.

For Christmas pudding go for Sainsbury's Winemakers Selection Muscat Saint Jean de Minervois NV. 

Chocolate dessert is best matched with Tesco Finest* 10 YO Tawny Port, wine experts who judge for the International Wine and Spirit Competition (IWSC) revealed.

But if it's roast goose you're having then a Cono Sur 20 Barrels Pinot Noir 2012 suits.  

And salmon goes particularly well with a Xanadu Next of Kin Chardonnay 201,  

The experts also shared top recommendations for everyday food and wine pairings, 

Fish and chips should be partnered with Champagne, a full-bodied red goes with sausage and mash, and a slug of aged Riesling will soften a spicy Indian.

But a full English breakfast is still best served with a cup of tea.   

Other suggestions include pairing a crisp Pinot Grigio with Chinese and serving pepperoni pizza with a glass of warm Chianti.

The experts also suggested similar wine and grape varieties to help consumers discover new tipples instead of sticking to their old favourites.

Sauvignon Blanc drinkers should try Pouilly Fumé while Zinfandel fans should replace it with a Primitivo.

General manager of the International Wine and Spirit Competition Ewan Lacey said: 'For most, one of the biggest dilemmas of the festive season is choosing the wine for Christmas lunch. 

'The IWSC works with the world's best drink experts and we wanted to share some of their top tips for buying wine and spirits.'
