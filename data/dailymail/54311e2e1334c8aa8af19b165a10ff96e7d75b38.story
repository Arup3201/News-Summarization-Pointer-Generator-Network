Toni Kroos has completed his £24million move to Real Madrid from Bayern Munich.

The German champions announced on Thursday morning that an agreement had been reached between the clubs and he would make an immediate transfer.

Kroos’ contract was due to expire next summer and the World Cup winner has penned a six-year deal at the Bernabeu.

And Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said: 'We would like to thank Toni Kroos for his time here in Munich.

'We enjoyed great success here together. We would like to wish him and his family all the best in Madrid and with Real.'

Kroos won three Bundesliga titles in four seasons with Bayern, clinching the DFB-Pokal three times and being part of the historic treble-winning side of 2012-13.

And the 2014 World Cup winner said: 'I know that at this club you are expected to win
trophies but I'm the right man for that because I'm used to winning.

'I know this is the correct decision and I'm very proud
to have made it.

'I cannot think of anything more wonderful than being
here. This is the biggest club in the world.

'In 2013 I won the Champions League and in 2014 Real
won it, and I hope we can win it again next year. I hope to be able to return
the confidence this club has shown in me.'
