The US State Department has agreed a $500 million arms deal with Poland including the sale of advanced cruise missiles and upgrades to their F-16 fighter fleet. 

The Polish government wants to buy 40 AGM-158A Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) from Lockheed Martin.

The new cruise missiles have a range of 250 miles and will enable the Polish Air Force to engage targets in Russia without having to leave their own airspace.

Poland has spent $5 billion upgrading its Air Force with new F-16 attack jets in a major defence investment

The new $500 million deal includes the purchase of 40 AGM-158A cruise missiles with a 250 mile range

According to the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency: 'The proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to improve the security of a NATO ally. 

'Poland continues to be an important force for political stability and economic progress in Central Europe. The proposed sale will improve Poland's capability to meet current and future threats of enemy air and ground weapon systems. 

'Poland will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland's air-to-ground strike capabilities and increase its contribution to future NATO operations. The proposed sale of the weapons, equipment, and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.' 

The proposed sale will require congressional approval although it is expected the transaction will be completed within the next two months.  

The plan comes as Poland intensifies efforts to modernize its military given the Russian aggression in Ukraine, something that has added to feelings of insecurity in Eastern Europe.

Polish Defence Minister Tomasz Siemoniak said Tuesday that missiles for the F-16s are 'one of the most modern weapons in the world at the moment. We really want to have them.'

It is understood that the missiles could be deployed and operational within two years. 

Poland has spent $5 billion on its F-16 fighter jets and is expected to announce an order for either the Eurofighter Typhoon or F-35 next generation jets. 

The US and Polish Air Force have conducted several training operations over the summer after 18 US F-16 Fighting Falcons were deployed to Lask Airforce base in Poland.  

According to US Air Force Major Matthew Spears: ' The NATO alliance draws its strength from the ability of its partner nations to seamlessly integrate forces during contingencies. That interoperability stems from a dedication to training during peacetime, and the Av-Det offers the U.S. and Polish air forces the unique opportunity to train together on a regular basis.' 

NATO aircraft also took part in Poland's national air exercise Eagle Talon.  

Meanwhile Mr Siemoniak said his country was considering selling weapons to Ukraine. 

He said: 'I confirm that the Polish defence industry is interested in this direction," Siemoniak told private radio station Zet. 'There are several products that may be interesting for Ukraine.

'If only there is a will and a readiness to purchase any elements of armaments in Poland, then Polish factories dream of nothing else but exports,' he also said.

NATO officials have said the alliance will not send weapons to Ukraine, which is not a member state, but they have also said individual allies may choose to do so.

Russia is fiercely opposed to closer ties between Ukraine and the NATO alliance.
