This is the heartwarming moment a former Marine corporal was reunited with his military dog four years after they served in Afghanistan together.

Deano Miller said the yellow Labrador Thor meant everything to him when they were serving together.

But if the canine seemed a little distracted when he arrived at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Mr Miller, 25, was not too worried.

The pair's reunion on Thursdsay marked the end of a long effort by Mr Miller to adopt the dog

He said the two have lots of time to get reacquainted after the years spent apart, The News Tribune has reported.

Their reunion yesterday follows an attempt by Mr Miller to adopt the dog after they worked together for seven months in 2010.

Since then, Thor served alongside several more handlers in combat while Mr Miller re-established a life in his hometown of Tacoma.

The adoption was aided by two groups that work to bring military war dogs back to the U.S. from combat abroad.

Mr Miller said Thor 'was the only thing that kept me going every day.'

Earlier this month, MailOnline reported how U.S. army veteran Jason Bos was also reunited with his long-lost war dog, also with the help of the American Humane Association and Mission K9 Rescue.

After two years apart, Cila the chocolate Labrador Retriever leaped into his former handler's arms at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.

'She looked at me, she started smelling me, she knew me,' Mr Bos told the Chicago Tribune.

'They tell you not to get too attached, that they’re not a pet, they’re a tool to help keep people safe. But it’s hard.'
