Rangers boss Ally McCoist praised his players after Saturday's triumph over Livingston ensured they have now gone two calendar years without an away league defeat.

The Ibrox outfit have romped to both the Third Division and League One titles since being thrown out of the Scottish Premiership.

And their record on the road has been a vital factor in that, with 32 wins and just four draws at Montrose, Stirling, Dunfermline Athletic and Alloa.

The Light Blues were last beaten on their travels in a league fixture on October 6, 2012 when they fell to a shock 1-0 reverse at Stirling Albion in the Third Division.

Rangers rounded off their second year of flawless away results after Lewis Macleod's stunning overhead winner handed them a 1-0 win at the Energy Assets Arena.

McCoist - relieved to see his side back to winning ways after Monday's humiliating home defeat to Hibernian - told the official Rangers website: 'It's an outstanding record and I'm delighted with that. Looking at the fact we've won 32 of the 36 games, it says a lot for the players we've got in our dressing room.

'That's a great record and we are very proud of them. We've a long way to go through and the most important thing is we're in contention at the end of the season.'

Marius Zaliukas, meanwhile, could be a doubt for Lithuania's forthcoming Euro 2016 qualifying matches after he was hurt in the early stages of the success at Livingston.

The defender suffered a knee problem and was able to play on until half-time before he was replaced by Darren McGregor.

The former Hearts centre-back has been selected in the Lithuanian squad for the games against Estonia and Slovenia after helping his country beat San Marino in its opening match.

McCoist added: 'It's difficult to gauge and we'll take a look at him again in the morning but I'd be doubtful he'll be playing in midweek.

'It looks a sore one and he's sitting there strapped up with an ice pack on it. We'll be better placed to know where we are tomorrow.'
