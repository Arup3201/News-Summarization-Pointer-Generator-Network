Hundreds more viewers have complained about the second episode of the BBC's period drama Jamaica Inn - despite the corporation pledging to fix the 'mumbling' dialogue.

The BBC received 546 complaints over Monday night's opening episode, with viewers saying they had to switch on subtitles or turn the volume to maximum to hear what was being said.

But despite promises that the problem would be fixed, last night's second episode drew 252 complaints so far - bringing the total to at least 798.

Muddying the waters: Around 800 people have complained to the BBC about poor sound in the flagship period drama Jamaica Inn, which is based on Daphne du Maurier's classic gothic novel about the Cornish moors

Disaster: One of the BBC's flagship shows, it has lost 1.6m viewers from the first episode to the second

A BBC spokeswoman had previously apologised and said: 'We are adjusting the dialogue levels in episode two and three to address audience concerns so they can enjoy the rest of the drama and would like to apologise to those viewers who were affected.'

The TV adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's classic gothic novel, starring Downton Abbey actress Jessica Brown Findlay, initially pulled in 6.1million viewers but lost 1.6million on that figure last night.

Set in 1821 against the windswept Cornish moors, the three-part drama was directed by Call The Midwife's Philippa Lowthorpe and follows Mary Yellan, who is forced to live with her aunt and domineering uncle after the death of her mother.

The final episode will be aired at 9pm tonight.

Emma Frost, who wrote the screenplay, suggested a technical fault was to blame and not the way that the cast delivered the lines.

Complaints: Viewers claimed they struggled to hear the first episode of BBC period drama Jamaica Inn when it aired on Monday evening

Blunder: Comedian Al Murray joked about the inaudible drama

The number of complaints to the BBC about Jamaica Inn has already surpassed all but one of the shows most complained about to Ofcom last year.

Although Ofcom - a separate body - receives fewer complaints than the BBC does, just one programme clocked in at more than 800. The full list was:

1. Big Brother: 9652. The X Factor: 7343. ITV News: 5744. Comic Relief: Funny for Money: 4925. Celebrity Big Brother: 4386. Britain's Got Talent: 4227. Emmerdale: 3768. BBC News: 3549. Downton Abbey: 25210. Coronation Street: 225

MailOnline asked the BBC for a similar list of its own complaints but a spokesman said one was not available.

'No surprises here,' she wrote. 'I'm told there was a major sound problem for tonight's broadcast of Jamaica Inn - not surprised you couldn't hear it'.

The total already makes the show one of the BBC's most complained-about in the last year.

It is still beaten by the coverage of Nelson Mandela's death, which received more than 1,300 complaints from viewers who said the airtime given to the former ANC leader was excessive.

But it is far more than the 303 who complained about the quality of the commentary at the Sochi Winter Olympics as British snowboarder Jenny Jones won a bronze medal.

The complaints come almost a year after BBC director-general Tony Hall said the corporation could look at how to stop actors 'muttering' in its TV dramas.

'I don't want to sound like a grumpy old man, but I also think muttering is something we could have a look at,' he said.

'Actors muttering can be testing - you find you have missed a line... you have to remember that you have an audience.'

He said that the corporation was addressing the problem of background music which made it difficult for some viewers, particularly older ones, to hear what was being said.

'Faulty': Only Fools and Horses actor John Challis joined the chorus of complaint

Had enough: This viewer changed channels out of frustration

Only option: These two viewers found they could only follow the action by turning on the subtitles

'Going deaf': Another viewer struggled to make it through the flagship programme

New role: The programme stars Downton Abbey actress Jessica Brown Findlay, [Mary Yellan], who goes to live with her aunt after her mother passes away

Some audience members put Monday's problems down to the 
actors’ thick Cornish accents.

Comedian Al Murray vented his 
frustration on Twitter, writing: ‘Find out what happens next in Jamaica 
Inn by getting your ears syringed!’

John
 Challis, best known for playing Boycie in Only Fools And Horses, said 
he hadn’t heard a single word, while former Strictly Come Dancing judge 
Arlene Phillips asked her followers whether anyone else was having 
trouble with the sound.

Viewer Alun Rees tweeted: ‘Jamaica Inn. The Unintelligible Arms more like. Rule 1. Speak the lines clearly. Even with a Cornish accent.’ Emma Frost, who wrote the screenplay for the adaptation, suggested that a technical fault, rather than the way that the cast delivered the lines, was to blame.

She said: ‘There was no problem on the version I saw, but tonight I couldn’t hear.

'The director and executives were on the phone to the BBC from the off yelling, “Why can’t we hear it?” Too late I fear. None of the production team know what happened with the sound. It was fine before.’

Director Philippa
 Lowthorpe previously told BBC Radio 5 Live: ‘I think there was a sound 
issue ... I don’t think anybody’s actually got down to the bottom of why
 it happened.

‘My mum and dad live in the North and they didn’t have a problem. So I don’t know if it was around the country or in some areas.

‘When
 we are dubbing, we always listen to it back on quite an old-fashioned 
ordinary telly. I suppose you can’t do everything for the vagaries of 
everybody’s telly.’

In an 
apology, the BBC blamed ‘issues with sound levels’, and said that 
although they could not be altered while the drama was on air, the 
dialogue was adjusted for last night’s second episode and the third 
which airs tonight.

Last year viewers of BBC drama Ripper Street were left similarly frustrated, complaining of ‘muffled’ lines in one episode.
