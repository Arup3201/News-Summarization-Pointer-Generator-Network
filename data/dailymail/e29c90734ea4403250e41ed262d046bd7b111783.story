Paul Scholes was lazing around at his home on Saddleworth Moor when his phone bleeped. It was a simple text message from his best mate Gary Neville.

‘Jack wants a word’ it read. ‘Jack who?’ replied Scholes. ‘Jack Wilshere you ****!!!’.

The night before, Scholes had made a memorable debut in the television studio at Old Trafford alongside a grinning Neville. He didn't hold back.

Critic: Scholes claimed Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere had not improved with age

‘Wilshere, what a really top young player, but he has not really gone on,’ observed Scholes on that evening in March. ‘Injuries haven’t helped him, but he doesn’t look any better now than when he was 17.’

Scholes has continued to tell it how it is since that evening, which is part of the attraction to his new employer BT Sport after a playing career spent largely away from the media glare.

As we chat about his new career as a TV analyst, he peppers the conversation with gems such as: ‘I wish I could have played for Mourinho.’

Nothing is off limits. He is passionate about the national team but scathing of Roy Hodgson’s claim that England play just like Germany.

More on all that in a moment. Back to Jack and that night at Old Trafford.

‘I would never have answered the phone if I knew he was going to talk about it to everyone,’ admitted Scholes. ‘I don’t think he should have told anyone about our phone call, but it’s up to him. I had hoped it was private.’

Scholes sees something special in Wilshere. The former Manchester United midfielder first came across him in 2010, when Wilshere was on loan at Bolton.

The midfielder said he was hurt by the ex-Manchester United man's comments

‘I wasn’t having a pop,’ he explained. ‘I was disappointed he wasn't being helped by his club, by his manager or his assistant manager.

‘As an English midfield player I just want him to do better. I know he has had a nightmare with those ankles, but I played against him when he was 17 and I just thought “Jesus”.’

Scholes, like everyone else, saw the pictures of Wilshere partying away in Las Vegas with Joe Hart and James Milner in the days after England’s shameful World Cup exit.

He is a man who likes a pint down the local with his pals and believes players are entitled to a few drinks if it helps them relax at the end of a tough season.

‘What Jack gets up to in the summer is up to him,’ he added. ‘He had a smoke, but it’s not the end of the world.

‘At United the laundry room used to be full of smoke in the mornings because Laurent Blanc and Fabien Barthez wouldn't start training until they had a cigarette.

‘I've known foreign players have a glass of wine or a beer the night before a game.

‘I have never smoked, but when there was a chance to go out with my wife or my friends then I would take it. I was brought up going to the pub on Saturday and Sunday afternoon with my mum and dad.

‘When I became a first-team player I realised when I was 19 or 20 that I would have to be more professional.’

Scholes was a dedicated player who won 11 Barclays Premier League titles and two Champions Leagues during his phenomenal career. He says he never considered leaving United — ‘imagine me as a Galactico? You must be joking’ — and he was genuinely surprised to learn of Xavi’s admiration for his ability.

‘It is embarrassing for someone of his ilk to talk about me like that,’ he admits. ‘What a player he has been for Spain and Barcelona. I only wish we could have played together.’

‘No one ever came in for me,’ he claims, although he goes on to admit he would have taken the chance to play for Chelsea’s controversial manager.

‘Mourinho is the man I would have wanted to play for. The way he comes across, he is a confident man and someone to look up to. He’s probably a little bit funny to listen to for the players.

‘He is a great manager and has managed some great clubs.’

Scholes played in some magnificent United teams, a powerful force at home and abroad as they chased so many honours.

Scholes talks as though he is still one of the boys in the dressing room, going on to say that he would love to see ‘Kroos or Schweinsteiger, or both, in a red shirt’.

He is a straight talker, something bookmaker Paddy Power capitalised on when the former United midfielder wrote a column criticising Wayne Rooney before the World Cup.

Rooney retaliated — ‘I don’t have his phone number and he doesn't have mine’ — but Scholes maintains that the new United captain is one of the best players in the Premier League.

‘Where the friction came from I’m not too sure because I like the lad,’ he added. ‘From my point of view there is no friction and I loved playing with him. He is an unbelievable footballer. He has been captaincy material for quite a while because he is vocal when he needs to be.

‘He demands the best from his team-mates and he isn't a shy lad.’

Rooney is five short of 100 caps for his country but Scholes is not taken with the pomp and ceremony that comes with those glass-cabinet presentations.

David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard have all been presented with golden caps on the pitch at Wembley.

Scholes, who won 66 caps before retiring from international duty in 2004, said: ‘What does 100 caps mean? It means you've played 100 games for your country. It’s not achieving what you want to achieve. Did you win something? No.’

Scholes is passionate about the national team and admits he was surprised to hear Hodgson claim England were close to Germany’s level despite exiting the World Cup with a single point.

‘England would like to do what Germany are doing but are we close? I honestly can’t see it.

‘We went out of the World Cup after two games, but Roy obviously thinks we are on the right track.

‘Germany took young players to a World Cup four years ago and were beating everyone. We did the same and went out. If I’m honest, I’m not really sure what it is that we do.’

Despite Scholes’ undoubted ability on the pitch, along with his strident opinions off it, he has been lost to the national set-up.

‘What would I do?’ he wonders aloud. Surely there has to be a role for him.

Instead he is working for BT Sport as he adjusts to life without Manchester United.

‘I wasn't looking to do it, but I can’t just sit at home. There has to be something to get out bed for.’

Paul Scholes is a pundit for BT Sport. This season BT Sport will show 38 Barclays Premier League matches exclusively live, plus top games from the FA Cup, UEFA Europa League and live action from six European leagues including the Bundesliga, Ligue 1, Serie A and the SPFL.
