The Duchess of Cornwall has spoken for the first time of the ‘horror’ she felt at watching her mother die from osteoporosis.

Writing exclusively in the Daily Mail today, she describes her anguish at watching her beloved ‘Mama’, the Honourable Rosalind Shand, die a ‘crippling, slow and agonising death’ from the fragile-bone disease.

It is dubbed the silent epidemic. Half of women and one in five men over the age of 50 will at some point suffer a fracture because of poor bone health.

Beloved: Camilla with her mother in 1965, who died from osteoporosis age 72 in 1994

Three million people have been officially diagnosed with the disease, including an increasing number of those in their 20s and 30s.

Research suggests that an astonishing 1,150 sufferers die needlessly each month through a lack of early diagnosis and treatment.  Better care would save the NHS millions of pounds a day.

Camilla, as president of the National Osteoporosis Society (NOS), has chosen ‘to put her head above the parapet’. She calls for an end to the huge variations of care throughout the country and for doctors to treat the condition more seriously and not just think of it as ‘that old woman’s disease’.

The Duchess of Cornwall's grandmother Sonia Keppel also died from the disease

Her words are all the more thought- 
provoking because, not only did she lose her mother, who passed away in 
1994 at the age of 72, to the debilitating hereditary disease, but her 
maternal grandmother, Sonia Keppel, too, just eight years earlier.

Camilla, 64, has never commented 
publicly on her own health but it is understood that, thankfully, she 
does not show any sign of developing the affliction so far.

‘Seeing someone you love die slowly, in 
agony, and knowing nothing about the disease that killed them is 
heart-breaking,’ she writes.

‘In those days osteoporosis, a crippling bone disease, was seldom discussed, rarely diagnosed and usually attributed to old women with so-called “Dowagers’ humps”.

‘My family and I watched in horror as my mother quite literally shrank in front of our eyes. She lost about eight inches in height and became so bent that she was unable to digest her food properly, leaving her with no appetite at all.

‘The local GP was kind and sympathetic but he, like us, was able to do little to alleviate the terrible pain Mama suffered so stoically.

‘In her later years she could not breathe without oxygen or totter around her beloved garden on her Zimmer frame.

‘I believe that the quality of her life became so dismal, and her suffering so unbearable, that she just gave up the fight and lost the will to live.’

The duchess explains that her own need for answers – not to mention the shocking ignorance of the medical profession – led her to the National Osteoporosis Society.

DOMINIQUE JACKSON: Is it any wonder that when the supposed fairy tale romance of Prince Charles and Diana went seriously and shockingly wrong, that a dismayed and credulous British public went on a frenzied and hysterical witch hunt?

They soon found their quarry; she had been as good as identified by Diana herself, in her tearful Panorama interview:  Camilla Parker Bowles.

Yet slowly, Camilla has been gaining ground and her relationship with the new Duchess of Cambridge has been a key factor in this rehabilitation.

She was particularly surprised to learn that a simple bone density scan, known as a DXA, is all it takes to diagnose osteoporosis at the earliest possible stage. Worryingly, however, only one in ten women and one in 50 men who have suffered a broken bone are being offered the vital follow-up scan when they go into hospital for medical treatment.

This is largely down to the UK’s infamous ‘postcode lottery’ health service and often depends on whether your health authority offers a fracture liaison service.

The reason why these scans are so important is that, because they cannot feel their bones getting weaker, sufferers are often unaware they have a problem until they sustain their first fracture. 

Catching the onset of osteoporosis early
also allows sufferers to take simple steps to prevent its progression, 
such as introducing a healthy, calcium-rich diet; incorporating gentle 
load-bearing exercise into their daily routine such as walking and 
dancing (the duchess is a particular advocate of hiking – ‘it’s what I 
love to do – just get out there, walking’, she says); or, for those at 
highest risk of fracture, beginning treatment with drugs.

Camilla, 64, has never commented on her own health, but it is understood she does not show any sign of developing the affliction so far

The charity is also campaigning to bring down the shocking number of deaths each month as a result of fragile bones. Many of these 1,150 victims are elderly people who contract infections either before or after treatment or simply die before they can be operated on.

During a meeting last week with 
sufferers at Clarence House, Prince Charles’s London residence, to mark 
the organisation’s 25th anniversary, Camilla spoke openly of her concern
that patients were getting a raw deal.

‘I find it very worrying indeed that people do not seem to be getting these DXA scans,’ she told the Mail.

‘It is such a simple way of diagnosing the disease at an early stage and yet the chances of you getting one often depend on where you live.

‘When we tried to speak to the doctors about my mother they just didn’t want to know. Their attitude was, “It’s just another old woman, just take another paracetamol”. It was incredibly frustrating. If it wasn’t for the NOS, I just wouldn’t have known what to do.’

The NOS are campaigning to reduce the number of people suffering unnecessarily because of fragile bones. 

For further information about its campaign for a break-free future visit www.nos.org.uk or call 01761 471771.

The charity also runs a staffed helpline 9am – 5pm weekdays on 0845 450 0230.

Camilla is celebrating her tenth year
as the president of the NOS, which is the only national charity to 
campaign for better diagnosis and prevention of the disease. She added: 
‘Tragically, it was too late for my mother, but that shouldn’t be the 
case now.

As she spoke in the sun-dappled Garden Room, surrounded by family photographs including one of the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and another of the recent christening of two of her five grandchildren, the duchess looked thoughtful.

‘You know, this has been a very personal journey for us as a family,’ she said.

‘It’s nothing to do with who I am now, it’s about watching someone very much loved die in front of you, in complete agony, and not be able to do a thing about it.

‘We really must do more to raise the profile of this hugely prevalent but ultimately preventable disease. Please do what you can to help us.’
