Former Manchester United midfielder Nicky Butt has admitted that Sir Alex Ferguson made him withdraw from the England squad during his time at Old Trafford.

Butt represented his country 39 times between 1997 and 2004 and was picked in the Three Lions squad for the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004.

But in a question and answer session alongside ex-Red Devils team-mates Phil Neville and Ryan Giggs at Soccerex, the 39-year-old revealed that he could have won more caps for England.

Explaining what Ferguson had told him, Butt said: 'You've got an England game coming up. You're not going.'

Butt's revelation reignites the debate over whether Premier League bosses show enough respect to the national side and follows QPR manager Harry Redknapp claiming that players asked him to be pulled out of squads during his time in charge of Tottenham.

Former Newcastle and Birmingham man Butt was also questioned on the attitudes of players in the England squad towards David Beckham's fame. 'Maybe a few people resented that,' he replied.

Clearly feeling in an outspoken mood, Butt even disagreed with his friend Neville when the ex-Everton skipper claimed that recent Three Lions squads were good enough to win a major tournament.

After Neville said that he thought 'England should be winning major tournaments', Butt quickly jumped in to add 'I don't'.

As well as reminiscing about his own career in the white of England, Butt also had his say on the current national set-up by stating that Roy Hodgson should exclusively play young players in order for them to mature together in the hope of winning silverware.
