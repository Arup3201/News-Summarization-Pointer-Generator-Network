As Eurostar marks 20 years since it connected the UK and Europe with high-speed underwater rail, its numbers really are adding up.

More than 145 million passengers have been taken to and from the Continent across two decades, according to a new infographic to celebrate the anniversary on November 14, 2014.

Along with facts and figures, the graph reveals some of the high-profile travellers that have step foot on board the train - including One Direction, Rihanna and Madonna.

On average, a Eurostar train speeds along at 186mph, not far short of the UK train speed record of 208mph set by Eurostar in 2003. 

The 750-person capacity of a train is that of two Boeing 747s while the combined length of the carriages is 90m longer than London landmark The Shard.

In terms of power, a Eurostar train punches out 1,600kw - a figure equal to 20 of Lewis Hamilton's Formula One cars.

After passengers reach its lowest depth of 75 metres beneath the Channel Tunnel, a Eurostar train can reach more than 100 destinations in six countries either directly or via connecting lines. 

In 2016 a new direct service will be introduced between London and Amsterdam.

Each year, the catering section now delivers 150,000 Great British breakfasts and 2.15million cups of coffes are served on board, while 33,000 bottles of champagne were opened in business class last year.

And the numbers are still racking up - in 2015 Eurostar welcome a new fleet of e320 trains which will boast 20 per cent more capacity and be able to hit an average of 200mph (320kmh).
