David Williford has been accused of animal cruelty after officers found 20 dead Guinea pigs, rabbits and dogs at his home

A man has been accused of trawling Craigslist offering a loving home to unwanted pets in order to torture and starve the animals.

David Williford was arrested after officers allegedly found more the 20 dead Guinea pigs, rabbits and dogs at his home.

Dozens of other animals were still alive but allegedly being kept in 'appalling conditions' in dirty cages with no light, water or food. 

Williford allegedly told animal control officers that he was slaughtering the animals for meat, but they were said to have found no evidence of this, according to King 5 News

He was charged with 12 counts of animal cruelty by prosecutors in Olympia, Washington, earlier this week.

Prosecutors alleged that Williford found the animals by going onto Craiglist and offering to rescue unwanted pets.

Two rabbits, three rats, and two dogs were seized from his farm in Olympia when police launched an investigation in February.

He was arrested after a vet concluded that one of the dead Guinea Pigs had been killed by blunt force trauma, according to the news channel.

Williford, who has no previous convictions, is currently being housed at Thurston County Jail on $150,000 bail. 

Some of the animals rescued from his property have been re-homed.
