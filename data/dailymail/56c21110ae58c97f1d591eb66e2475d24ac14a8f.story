Dual champion jockey Paul Hanagan suffered a hairline fracture of his left arm when his mount White Nile fell on the opening day of Glorious Goodwood.

He must now hope he will be able to return to action in time to partner his King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes and Oaks winner Taghrooda in her next target, next month’s Yorkshire Oaks on August 21.

Hanagan had X-rays on Tuesday night after returning to his Newmarket base.

Hard fall: Paul Hanagan will be out of action for a while following the fracture in his arm

His agent Richard Hale said: ‘He has a hairline fracture of his lower arm. It is in a cast. It is not an area of movement so hopefully he will not be out too long and be back in time for York.’

Hanagan had been enjoying a fantastic summer in his role as No 1 jockey for owner Sheik Hamdam Al Maktoum. Earlier this month he also won the Group One Eclipse Stakes on William Haggas-trained Mukhadram.

He had been due to ride at Sandown on Wednesday and among the rides he will miss at Glorious Goodwood is Muteela, winner of the Sandringham Stakes at Royal Ascot in June.

The Mark Johnston-trained filly is due to run on Friday where she has two entries.
