A man has been arrested after allegedly impersonating Sandy Hook gunman Adam Lanza and making threatening phone calls to locals in the aftermath of the shooting, authorities have said.

Wilfrido Cardenas Hoffman, 30, reportedly made 96 calls to residents in Newtown, Connecticut, just two days after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012.

In one call, he allegedly said: 'This is Adam Lanza. I'm gonna kill you. You're dead. You're dead. You hear me? You're dead.'

Meanwhile, in another, he bragged: 'This is Adam Lanza. 
I'm gonna kill you. You're dead. With my machine gun. You're dead,' according to federal prosecutors.

The calls were reportedly made on December 16 - just 48 hours after 20-year-old Lanza killed his mother at their Newtown home, before shooting to death 20 children, six staff and himself at the school.

Hoffman, from El Hatillo, Venezuela, was arrested on Saturday at Miami International Airport while traveling to Mexico from Venezuela, the U.S. Attorney's office said.

His arrest comes a year and a half after he was charged in a criminal complaint with transmitting threats to injure a person. It remains unclear why he was only arrested 18 months on.

The complaint against Hoffman, filed in May 2013, was partially unsealed yesterday.

'This complaint charges that Cardenas Hoffman made dozens of threatening telephone calls to residents of Newtown when they were suffering from one of the worst tragedies in our nation's history,' U.S. Attorney Deirdre Daly said.

'Threatening such vulnerable people is reprehensible and inhuman criminal conduct. Further, it inappropriately stressed law enforcement resources at a critically demanding time.'

The calls were made via an iPod using an online telephone service, and were either delivered from or routed through Venezuela, the complaint said.

If convicted of the charge, Hoffman faces a maximum five-year prison term and a fine of up to $250,000.

FBI Special Agent in Charge, Patricia Ferrick, said, 'This arrest, a year and
 a half after the Newtown tragedy, speaks to the unrelenting commitment 
and compassion for victims and their families and sends an important 
warning to those inclined to commit similar crimes.'

Hoffman appeared at court in Florida yesterday and is due back on Thursday for a detention hearing.

His attorneys were not immediately available for comment.
