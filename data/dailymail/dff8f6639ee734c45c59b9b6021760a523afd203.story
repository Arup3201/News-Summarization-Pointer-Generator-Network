The Florida woman arrested for allegedly drowning a two-week-old puppy in a Nebraska airport bathroom was rearrested after posting bail.

Anderson was wanted on a felony charge of grand theft, according to ABC.

The 56-year-old is not allowed bail as the warrant is from another state. Instead, the woman will remain in the Hall County Jail until her next court appearance on Feb. 10.

Anderson faces a charge of cruel neglect of animals because, police allege, she drowned a young puppy in a Nebraska airport bathroom on Jan. 23 after officials told her she could not board the plane with the small dog, the Huffington Post reports.

Court: The out-of-state warrant means Anderson is not allowed bail, instead, the woman will remain in the Hall County Jail until her next court appearance on Feb. 10.

The woman arrived at the airport with five dogs ready to head back to her Edgewater home, but officials denied her access to the plane as federal aviation regulations state dogs must be at least eight weeks old to fly. 

She returned the next day with two older dogs in proper kennels and was caught trying to sneak a young doberman puppy in her carry-on luggage, Newser reports. 

A Grand Island Police official said the puppy was so young, its eyes weren't even open yet.

Police say witnesses saw Anderson enter the bathroom with a puppy and leave without it, CBS reports. 

A passenger found a dead puppy in the toilet. 

An autopsy determined the cause of the puppy's death was drowning.
