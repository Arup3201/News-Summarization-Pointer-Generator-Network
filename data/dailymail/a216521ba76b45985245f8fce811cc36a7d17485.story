A descendant of the founder of the billion-dollar oil company Halliburton, was found dead in a bathtub at her Florida mansion this week and now police are diving in the canal behind the house - searching for clues in the mysterious homicide.

The body of 59-year-old Jill Halliburton Su was found Monday by her oldest son, who was sent to check up on the house when her husband couldn't access the home's surveillance cameras at work. 

Mrs Su's son called police when he found the body, saying he thought it was a suicide. But when authorities arrived on the scene they started investigating the death as a homicide, since the home's back door near the pool was broken and a room had  been ransacked, indicating a break in. 

She was the grand-niece of Halliburton Oil Co founder Erle P Halliburton. Her father Louis Halliburton worked for his uncle Erle at the oil business for a few years after fighting in World War II. Louis died last year at the age of 88.

They have not yet released any information on the details of how Su died. 

Police interviewed both Su's son, and her husband, prominent University of Florida Professor Nan-Yao Su, an expert in entomology, the study of insects. 

Neither have been named as suspects in Su's death but investigators point out that no one has been ruled out yet. 

'I don’t want to say anybody’s been ruled out as a suspect. At this time, this is a very active investigation,' Davie Police Captain Dale Engle told ABC News. 'We did find a door that was broken or the glass of a door that was broken.'

Covered: Investigators spent Tuesday and Wednesday diving in the canal behind the home, searching for possible evidence

On Tuesday and Wednesday, investigators conducted dives of the canals behind the property, looking for evidence that might illuminate how Su was killed.  

'We don’t want to get into specifics of what they are looking for but we do think there is evidence connected to the crime,' Engle told CBS. 

Police are also canvassing the neighborhood and asking any residents of the gated community to submit any surveillance footage from security cameras. 

Su worked as a volunteer reading books for the blind at the Fort Lauderdale organization Insight for the Blind.

'She was so popular with everyone and would do whatever was needed either reading or monitoring recordings,' said Insight's Executive Director Mathew Corey. 

According to public records, the couple bought the $4,576=square-foot home where Mrs Su was found dead in 200 for $514,000 but it's now valued at around $1million.
