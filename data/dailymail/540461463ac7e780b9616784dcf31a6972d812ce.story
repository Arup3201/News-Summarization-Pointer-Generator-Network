Sky has unveiled an iPad app that could finally mean the end of hunting for the TV remote.

It turns an iPad into a giant Sky remote, letting users change channels, record programmes and even rewind shows.

The system is also set to be upgraded with 'social TV' features to let users share what they are watching with friends.

Sky's new iPad app lets people control their Sky+ box using their finger to scroll through listings, change channels and choose shows to record. The interface has been designed to look exactly like Sky's current TV menu system.

'Today we’re taking a major step forward in giving Sky customers even more control over their TV viewing experience with the launch of an update to our pioneering Sky+ app which lets Sky customers transform their iPad into a remote control,' said Sky's Luke Bradley-Jones.

'With a simple swipe or tap of their fingers on their iPad screen, Sky customers are from today able to use the app to change channels as well as pause, play and rewind TV.'

The free app can used by anyone who has a Sky box connected to their home network and an iPad.

Owners can change channels on their living room TV by selecting the programme they want to watch on Sky's iPad app. They can also record, pause and even rewind shows.

The Sky+ box is connected to a home network via either a cable or wireless connection.

This allows the iPad, which must be connected to the same network, to 'see' the TV box and control it.

Alongside this, the update will also allow Sky customers to see what’s stored on their Sky+ planner and make changes without interrupting their TV viewing. 

'A new design meanwhile makes it even easier for Sky customers to use the app to set recordings of their favourite shows over the following seven days, scrolling through the whole week in the TV Guide and selecting which shows they want to record, which they can do either by episode or entire series,' Sky said.

The move echoes Apple, which produce an iPad and iPhone remote control for its Apple TV product.

Several other firms such as Samsung and LG have also developed apps for mobile phones that allow users to control their TV from a phone and iPad, while Microsoft recently announced Smart Glass for its Xbox games console, which will allow phone and tablet owners to see extra information about shows they are watching and control video and music.

However, the Sky service goes much further than currently available services, integrating programme guides.

The free app will also let people view a full programme guide without interrupting the show they are watching.

Sky also revealed it plans to add Zeebox functionality to the service.

Set up by ex iPlayer boss Anthony 
Rose, Zeebox is an app which lets people see tweets 
and other information on the programme they are watching on their iPad screen.

The Zeebox software which Sky today said it will add to its own iPad app to let people share what they are watching on Facebook and Twitter.

Users can 'check in' to programmes, which can also be displayed on Twitter and Facebook.

Sky also plans to create special app content for Zeebox for some of its shows.

To access the full range of 
functionality through the revamped app, Sky TV customers need to have 
the new look Sky TV Guide on their Sky+HD box, and to make sure their 
Sky+HD box is connected to the same broadband network as their iPad.

The iPad app looks identical to Sky's on screen programme guide.
