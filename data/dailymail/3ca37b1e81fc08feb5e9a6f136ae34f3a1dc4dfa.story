Brazil's 7-1 defeat by Germany will be remembered for several reasons. A nation being dismantled on the biggest stage in their own backyard will override most.

But one man who may be overlooked in the hysteria is Joachim Low, the leader of the rout.

Brazil were depleted without Neymar and Thiago Silva, but Low still masterminded a demolition that, if any sympathy you have for Brazil is overlooked, was as impressive as it was ruthless.

Put on the spot at both half-time and full-time, BBC's Alan Shearer criticised Brazil and praised Germany in equal measure, a direction some pundits dodged. He was spot on.

So, who is Joachim Low? Eight years has told us a lot, but Low continues to grow as a manager.

Appearances in a World Cup final and semi-final, plus a European Championship final and semi-final tells us he is consistent. Not surprising.

He has built a model for Germany that can be recycled for years to come. The talent pool is huge, but Low does not rest believing the talent alone will prevail.

Low is a believer in the German players being individually suited to his style, not shoehorning eleven players into positions based on their club performances.

Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola was paid a huge 
compliment when Low attempted to use Philipp Lahm in midfield during the
 group stages, the Spaniard's preferred position for one of the best full-backs we have ever seen.

But Low was not afraid to change his tune after 
below-par displays against Ghana, USA and Algeria in the last 16, 
compared to the 4-0 thrashing of Portugal.

Lahm went back to full-back and they overcame France in the quarter-finals despite some doubters.

There
 is more to the 54-year-old than reliability. He is a likeable character
 who stands by his tactical decisions with an air of confidence that on 
Tuesday night shone through to his players.

Like so many great managers, his playing career comes second to his coaching achievements.

An attacking midfielder, he appeared for
 West Germany's U21 side four times, and had difficulties settling into 
any German side, leaving Freiburg in 1980 only to return twice.

Mentor: Low was Jurgen Klinsmann's assistant for two years between 2004 and 2006

Big call: Low made the decision to push Lahm back to full-back for the quarter-final against France

Low's real talents were with coaching, and after a short spell as manager with FC Frauenfeld he became Stuttgart assistant and then boss.

Two
 successful years with Stuttgart culminated in a 1-0 defeat to Chelsea 
in the European Cup Winners Cup final in 1998, before an unsuccessful 
year-long spell Fenerbahce.

Several years in limbo ended when 
Jurgen Klinsmann brought Low in as his assistant with Germany in 2004 
following a poor European Championship campaign.

Two
 years with Klinsmann taught him a great deal, particularly seeing how the manager dealt with pressure during the World Cup on home soil in 2006. Upon his 
appointment as Klinsmann's successor in 2006, Low was more than ready to build 
Germany into a force again after a decade of inconsistency.

Low is a motivator and a tactician, leaving no stone unturned while preventing Germany from becoming running robots.

The speed in which they attacked when winning the ball in Belo Horizonte will strike fear into both Argentina and Holland.

Germany must be favourites. And don't forget, they are doing this without their star man, Marco Reus.

Low is already one of the longest-serving managers in football today. A World Cup win would surely give him another four years at least, if he wants them. You'll see four stars on his umlaut if he lifts the trophy at the Maracana.
