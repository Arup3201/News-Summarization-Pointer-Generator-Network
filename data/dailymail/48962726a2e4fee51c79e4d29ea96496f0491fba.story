After yesterday's woeful performance in the 3-0 Community Shield defeat by Arsenal, Manchester City fans may be tempted to press the panic button before the season has even begun.

But don't worry too much, City fans, with your star names still to return and history on your side, this could yet transpire to be yet another glorious season for Manuel Pellegrini's men....

Not the best start: Manchester City players head up the Wembley steps to receive their runners-up medal following  a 3-0 defeat to Arsenal in the Community Shield on Sunday

1. Best players still to return

Pablo Zabaleta, Bacary Sagna, Vincent Kompany, Martin Demichelis, Frank Lampard, Fernandinho and Sergio Aguero were all rested after their World Cup exertions. Other star names such as Joe Hart and David Silva only started on the bench. 

Many of those players would walk into and transform City's starting line-up. Don't expect to see too much more of Dedryck Boyata and Matija Nastasic in a Manchester City shirt this season.

2. City were slow starters last season

The Champions lost four of their first 11 games last season and Manuel Pellegrini's side were languishing in 8th position by the middle of November. They were even below David Moyes' Manchester United by that stage. 

As with all the best title winners, they clicked into gear when it truly mattered, losing only two of their last 27 matches and winning their last five. 

There will be no panic at Manchester City, although clashes against Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea before the end of September will call for a vast improvement.

3. Eliaquim Mangala is set to arrive

The Frenchman will add further pace and athleticism to the City rearguard and is expected to form an outstanding partnership with Vincent Kompany.

 It was a problem position for Pellegrini for much of last season - although Demichelis did come good in the end - and the Chilean will be relieved to now have two centre-backs of elite standing in his ranks.

4. The Community Shield is not the best indicator

Come on, now, even David Moyes' Manchester United won it last year. More pertinently, the last time City lost in the Community Shield - in the summer of 2011 - they went on to win the Premier League title. 

When they won the Community Shield against Chelsea the following summer, they then surrendered their crown and lost to Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup final.

False dawn: David Moyes lifted the Community Shield this time last year but his tenure at United was a disaster

5. History suggests the Treble is on

The last team to lose a Community Shield 3-0? 

The Manchester United team that would go on to win the treble in 1999. On that summer's day in 1998, United were defeated by a Nicholas Anelka-inspired Arsenal. So don't worry too much City fans. 

Oh, and some bad news for giddy Arsenal followers...the Gunners failed to win the Premier League on the four previous occasions they lifted the Charity or Community Shield (1998-1999, 1999-2000, 2002-2003, 2004-05).

No form guide: Arsenal won the 1998 Charity Shield 3-0 against Man United, but Alex Ferguson's side went on to win a Treble of the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup that season
