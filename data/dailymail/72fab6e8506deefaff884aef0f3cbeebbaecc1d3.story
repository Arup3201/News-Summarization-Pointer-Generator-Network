Didier Drogba may miss the start of the season after twisting an ankle in Sunday’s friendly against Ferencvaros. 

Drogba hopes to resume training before the end of the week after scan yesterday showed no serious damage to ligaments but Jose Mourinho is not likely to risk the 36-year-old at Burnley on Monday if there is any doubt about his readiness.

The injury scare does, however, issue a reminder that Mourinho’s squad is light on strikers, despite the £32million signing of Diego Costa from Atletico Madrid.

 Samuel Eto’o, Demba Ba and Romelu Lukaku have all been sold, leaving three senior strikers at the club: Costa, Fernando Torres and Drogba.

If he is unable to reinforce this department before the end of the month it places great pressure on Costa to adjust quickly to English football and to avoid injury. 

Speaking about his injury the striker told chelseafc.com: 'I twisted my ankle and I couldn't continue.

'In the next few days we are going to do some treatment and I hope everything will be better.'
