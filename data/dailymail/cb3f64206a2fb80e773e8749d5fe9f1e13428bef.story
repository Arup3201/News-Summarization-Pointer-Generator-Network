Drivers are being ripped off by a postcode pumps lottery with 10p gaps between nearby garages, motoring groups have said - even as the Prime Minister warned retailers to pass on tumbling oil costs.

David Cameron's remarks came after experts predicted the price of crude oil would continue to fall, having already dropped 40 per cent over the past six months.

Today average petrol prices dropped to 119.4p a litre, falling below 120p for the first time in four years. But as these photographs show, it depends where motorists choose to shop.

Spot the difference: Petrol prices hit 120p a litre today - but as these photos show, it still depends where you shop. Esso in Gravesend, Kent, charged 114.9p (left) while Shell at London's M1 services charged 127.9p

Eye-watering: The Chelsea Cloisters service station in Sloane Avenue, one of London's most expensive streets, was charging 179p a litre for unleaded today. In the past experts have blamed the road's high rents

A Shell garage at the M1 motorway services in Edgware, north London, was charging 127.9p a litre for unleaded today - while just seven miles away in Finchley, a BP garage was charging 119.9p.

Just outside the capital in Gravesend, Kent, an Esso garage was charging 114.9p a litre for unleaded - almost matching the 114.7p-a-litre nationwide cap set by Asda today.

Asda has been leading the way with cuts – copied by its rivals – and the AA said motorists were paying more in districts without a branch of the supermarket chain.

AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said: ‘It is a postcode lottery rip-off of winners and losers.

‘London and Aylesbury have some maverick independents and non-supermarkets who are undercutting even Asda which is usually the price-cut leader.

‘Asda then lowers prices nationally and the other supermarkets follow to match them in towns where there is an Asda. But where there isn’t an Asda, price falls take longer to arrive.’

Despite the competition, it seemed some in London have been largely untouched by falling prices.

At the Chelsea Cloisters petrol station in Sloane Avenue, Chelsea - one of London's most expensive streets - unleaded fuel cost an eye-watering 179p a litre today, a representative told MailOnline. 

The petrol station appears to be an exceptional case. It has made headlines for its huge prices in the past and experts have blamed the enormous rent its owner has to pay.

A staff member confirmed the cost to MailOnline twice - then said any concerns should be raised with the manager.

But the pattern of varying prices was repeated across Britain. 

MailOnline looked at five cities today and easily found petrol prices varying by between 7p and 15p a litre.

Among the more expensive were motorway service stations. In Bristol, a Shell garage off the M5 just outside the city was charging 127.9p a litre - 13.2p more than the Asda petrol stations within the city. 

In Birmingham, the Esso garage at Frankley Services on the M5 charged 15.2p more than Asda supermarkets inside the city.

A Shell spokesman said it did not operate the garage pictured so had no control over the price, adding: 'Prices at motorway sites are influenced by a number of factors, including rents typically being higher than at other forecourts, and increased maintenance costs due to increased traffic volumes, especially HGVs.'

Independent firms also lose out, however. Independent garage M&S Johnson, near Cardiff, was charging 10.2p more today than an Asda superstore less than three miles away.

According to price comparison site petrolprices.com, whose figures were compiled yesterday, there was a variation of 34.2p a litre in Leeds, 25p in Greater London, 14.2p in Manchester and 9.2p in Edinburgh - though the most overpriced garages were not revealed.

Competition in Essex was particularly fierce, and the motorists using an Esso station in Ongar were paying only 112.9p a litre for unleaded. 

The RAC predicts prices will drop by at least 8p a litre for unleaded and by 6p a litre for diesel over the next fortnight.

It found a number of 16p-a-litre differences between garages in the same area. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ‘The price we pay at the pump is more likely to be affected by local retail dynamics than it is by distribution costs which are something of a red herring.

'Price tends to be driven by the presence of supermarkets keen to compete on price or an independent forecourt retailer determined to offer the cheapest fuel.

‘If a town doesn’t have either of these, it can lead to motorists paying several pence a litre more than a neighbouring town just a few miles away.’ 

Supermarket chains have been criticised by the main petrol firms in the past for selling fuel as a 'loss leader' due to relentless competition.

But despite the commercial tension there was variation too today among the big-name supermarkets, which have pushed down prices the hardest in a bid to retain trade.

Asda clinched most of the cheapest prices, setting a cap of 114.7p a litre for unleaded across the country today - while most supermarket chains varied from branch to branch.

The average price at Morrisons was more than 2p higher than Asda at 116.9p a litre, though it is due to drop another 1p tomorrow morning. 

Falling prices: Petrol prices have hit a four-year low, but the prices of crude oil have fallen much faster

At the 800 of 1,000 Shell-branded sites which Shell operates, the average unleaded price was 119.0p.

Other retailers, including Tesco and Esso, refused to tell MailOnline average pump prices for commercial reasons. However, Tesco cut prices at all 500 of its filling stations by 1p a litre today.

David Cameron this morning warned forecourts that he was keeping 'a close and watchful eye' to see if they will pass on falling oil prices to motorists.

'We need to be clear to the industry that we’re keeping a close eye on this issue in terms of forecourt pricing,' his spokesman said. 'The Government is going to keep a close and watchful eye on that sector.'

It came after Kevin Daly, senior economist at Goldman Sachs, described the recent slump in oil prices as a ‘significant stimulus’ to the economy which would benefit families around the country.

Giving evidence to the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Daly predicted the price of unleaded petrol could fall another 15p to between £1.05 and £1.10 a litre.

Unleaded petrol prices fell to an average of 122.9p a litre last month and have dropped closer to 120p a litre since then, according to the AA.

With wages stagnant, Mr Daly told the Treasury Committee that ‘the men and women of Britain will really notice things such as the sharp decline in oil prices.’

The value of Brent crude has tumbled 40pc since the June high of $115 a barrel as production in the US has surged while demand from faltering economies in the eurozone and China has fallen.

Oil prices have dropped to a five year low of just under $66 a barrel this week and rose to $66.4 yesterday.

Yet retailers - who have been criticised for not passing on enough of the savings to motorists - insist they are not to blame for persistently high prices.

David Cameron warned petrol companies he would 'keep an eye' on them

A spokesman for BP told MailOnline: 'Prices aren't related to the crude oil price - they're much more related to the cost of petrol and diesel which are sold as commodities in their own right.

'So there are all sorts of factors including exchange rates, and then of course you've got duty and VAT on top of everything. We aim to be as competitive as possible.' 

RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams, however, maintained retailers should use the drop in costs to give the 'Christmas present motorists have been waiting for' at the pumps.

'The wholesale prices of both petrol and diesel have reduced dramatically in recent weeks, so much so that there is room for petrol prices to come down by over 8p a litre and diesel by over 6p a litre in the next fortnight,' he said.

'We are hopeful motorists will see average petrol prices under 112p a litre, something they will not have seen since February 2010. If this happens the cheapest retailers will no doubt be selling petrol for well under 110p a litre, perhaps even lower.' 

Prime Minister David Cameron, chancellor George Osborne and the Bank of England governor Mark Carney have all warned of the threat posed to the UK recovery by problems in the global economy.

But Mr Daly said he was ‘relatively optimistic’, adding:

‘My own view is that people respond more to pounds and pence in their pockets rather than politicians warning about dangers lurking abroad.’

Figures released yesterday showed the UK economy is still growing at a steady pace, despite a surprise decline in manufacturing.

Latest forecasts from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research suggest the economy grew 0.7pc in the three months to November, unchanged from GDP of 0.7 per cent in the three months to October.

But manufacturing contracted 0.7 per cent between September and October.
