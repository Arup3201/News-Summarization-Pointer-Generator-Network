As one of the Duke of Wellington’s most skilful generals, he fought on the frontline of some of the bloodiest Napoleonic wars and was the highest ranking officer to die at the Battle of Waterloo.

So it is perhaps unsurprising that, to celebrate Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Picton’s military heroism, a large portrait of the Welshman hangs inside the court house in Carmarthen, South Wales.

But today it emerged that a row has broken out about the painting, which lawyers claim is offensive and should not be displayed behind the judge’s chair in Carmarthen Crown Court.

They say Sir Thomas’s reputation as a cruel and brutal colonial governor – he was military governor of Trinidad at the turn of the 19th century, where he was accused of torturing a young slave girl - mean his image should not be associated with modern equality and justice.

Pride of place: The painting has hung above the judge's chair at Carmarthen court house for the last 182 years

Sir Thomas Picton was born in Poyston, Pembrokeshire in 1758.

In 1771 at the tender age of just 13, he was commissioned to enlist in the 12th regiment which was commanded by his uncle.

Sir Thomas Picton in the 1970 film 'Waterloo'. Sir Thomas was leading 
the British infantry in civilian clothing - and carrying his umbrella - 
when a French musket-ball penetrated his top hat and killed him 
instantly

He first saw active service in St Lucia in 1796, shortly after which he served as governor of Trinidad.

It
was during his tenure as governor in the West Indies that he acquired 
both a reputation for having a violent temperament and respect for 
courageously leading troops into battle.

He is chiefly remembered for serving under the Duke Of Wellington in the Iberian Peninsula War and at the Battle Of Waterloo.

He became the most senior British officer to die when a French musket-ball penetrated his top hat and killed him instantly.

Sir
Thomas was leading the British infantry in civilian clothing - and 
carrying his umbrella - at the time, due to his uniform having failed to
reach him.

However,  Carmarthenshire Museum, who
own the 8ft x 4ft portrait, disagree and say it was specifically 
commissioned for the court house, where it has lived for the past 182 
years, and should stay.

Criminal lawyer Kate Williams, who is
among those calling for the painting to be taken down, said: 'I 
appreciate the painting for historical purposes and that he (Picton) was
a figure of note.

'But I find it very offensive that 
someone who was not only a known slaver, but also allegedly tortured a 
slave, should have his picture in a place where the values of justice 
are served.

'It’s fair to say he has a murky past
and it is inappropriate to have his picture in a modern court of law, 
where we are supposed to represent the principles of equality and 
justice for all.

'I think people might misread the 
prominence of the picture as saying he has done something worthwhile to 
contribute towards justice, which really isn't the case.'

Sir Thomas, who was born in Poyston, 
Pembrokeshire, in 1758, was appointed military governor of Trinidad 
following the British victory in 1797 where he oversaw the production of
sugar by slaves on the island’s plantations.

But he operated a brutally authoritarian regime which lead to accusations of slave torture, false imprisonment and execution.

In 1806 he was called back to Britain
and faced trial in London over claims he authorised the torture of a 
13-year-old girl, Louisa Calderon, who was accused of robbery, by 
forcing her to stand on a sharpened wooden peg while suspended from the 
ceiling.

This form of torture was dubbed 
'Pictoning' at the trial and, although he was found guilty, Sir Thomas 
later overturned his conviction on appeal and went on to resume his 
military career.

His greatest successes came in Spain,
where he was instrumental in the Battle of Vitoria, helping Wellington 
eventually claim victory in the Peninsular War.

Sir Thomas was killed after being was
shot through the temple by a musket ball at the Battle of Waterloo, 
where, Welsh folklore contends, he fought in his top hat and tails 
because his uniform had not arrived at the frontline in time.

The portrait, by Sir Martin Archer Shee, was presented to the former Carmarthen Borough Council on September 2 1829. It was placed in the town¿s Guildhall (pictured) ¿ which is now used as a court ¿ and has been hanging in the same spot ever since.

His military reputation was so high 
after his death that several colonial frontier towns in Canada, 
Australia and New Zealand were named after him and he remains the only 
Welshman to be buried in St Paul’s Cathedral.

His statue is among 12  'Heroes of 
Wales', in Cardiff’s City Hall, a comprehensive school in Pembrokeshire 
is named after him and there is also another monument to him in 
Carmarthen.

Ann Dorset, a spokeswoman for the 
museum, said that although Sir Thomas was a 'cruel and brutal' governor
of Trinidad, he was a 'a man of his time' and should not be judged by 
today’s standards.

'I think it would be a shame to move the painting from its original home,' she said.

'Picton was a very well respected 
general but on the other hand he was regarded as a rough and tough man 
and a great disciplinarian.

'He was a great leader of men and these wars were tough.

'It was hand to hand fighting and they were not like the battles of today. He would have been right in the middle of it.

'I think we have to accept Picton warts and all and not judge him by today's standards.'

Richard Goodridge, former mayor of Carmarthen, said removing the painting would be churlish.

He said: 'Louisa Calderon suffered no ill effects from the treatment she received and required no medical attention afterwards.

'After she was released from custody she walked more than a mile to the store where the crime took place, smoking a cigar.

'In February 1810 the court ordered 
Picton's recognisance and no further action ever took place. He was, and
remains to this day, innocent of all the charges.

'Lieutenant General Sir Thomas 
Picton, despite what history may think of his unconventional ways, was 
an extremely popular officer and was killed in action at the battle of 
Waterloo in 1815 — the most senior officer to die for his country.'
