Dr. Ben Carson, the rising African-American Republican star who is considering a run for the presidency, endorsed a nutritional supplement made by a firm embroiled in controversy, including claims that it's a pyramid scheme selling 'scam' products. 

The revelation will damage Carson's standing as a moral crusader who aims to put an unassailable face on the GOP's anti-Obamacare health policies and could tank his future political plans.

Mannatech, a multi-level marketing sales company that sells weight-loss products, skin creams and so-called 'nutraceuticals.' Carson began his relationship with the firm in 2004, speaking at its annual sales conference, and gave repeat performances in 2011 and 2013.

His business manager Armstrong Williams told National Review Online that 'the decision that has been made' that Carson's won't publicly address his relationship with the company, and insisted the appearances were arranged by an outside speaker's bureau that currently charges more than $40,000 per speech for his services.

'All we know is that the Washington Speaker’s Bureau, which booked hundreds of speaking engagements for him through the year, booked these engagements,' Williams insisted. 'He had no idea who these people are.'

Mannatech, whose name is a play on the heavenly food from the Bible, offers its flagship 'glyconutritional dietary supplement' Ambrotose by claiming it can 'improve your health with an advanced blend of saccharides.'

'Saccharide' is a synonym for sugar, and glyconutrients including eight common sugars including simple glucose.

In a 2008 paper written for the journal 'Glycobiology,' Johns Hopkins University pharmacology professor Dr. Ronald Schnarr warned that 'people desperate for medical breakthroughs have spent billions of dollars to purchase plant polysaccharides whose medical value has not been subjected to FDA-approved clinical trials, or, in some instances, whose medical value has been disproved.'

And in an ABC News investigation, Dr. Hudson Freeze of the Burnham Institute for Medical Research in La Jolla, California warned that glyconutrients might accomplish little aside from making consumers gassy.

'There are authentic, scientific studies that have looked at people drinking these kinds of materials,' Freeze said. 'And it doesn't really do anything except increase flatulence.' 

Mannatech also sells weight-loss meal replacement shakes for $35.00 per jar and 1.4 oz. containers of night cream for $65.00.

But it's the concept of 'glyconutrition' that had Carson sold when he made an online video for Mannatech and extolled its latest offering, Nutriverus, as 'a way to restore natural diet as a medicine.'

'The wonderful thing about a company like Mannatech is that they recognize that when God made us, He gave us the right fuel,' the retired doctor says on camera. 'And that fuel was the right kind of healthy food.'

'You know we live in a society that is very sophisticated, and sometimes we’re not able to achieve the original diet. And we have to alter our diet to fit our lifestyle. Many of the natural things are not included in our diet. Basically what the company is doing is trying to find a way to restore natural diet as a medicine or as a mechanism for maintaining health.'

Texas Governor Greg Abbot disagreed in 2007, when he was the state's attorney general.

The company, he said in a press release accompanying a lawsuit, used 'deceptive practices pose a health risk to seriously-ill consumers who may forgo traditional medical attention because of the company’s false claims.'

That came three years after Carson's first speech to the company's sales force.

Abbot's legal filing in the case charged that Mannatech used testimonials in its sales program that claimed the company's products had helped beat autism and non-Hodgkins lymphoma.

It also blew the whistle on a Mannatech-distributed CD that 'provided example after example of how ‘glyconutrients’ (i.e., Mannatech’s products) cured, treated, or mitigated diseases including but not limited to toxic shock syndrome, heart failure, asthma, arthritis, Lou Gehrig’s Disease, Attention Deficit Disorder, and lung inflammation.' 

ABC News reported that year that Ambrotose 'costs at least $200 a month,' and was sold as 'a miracle cure that could fix a broad range of diseases, from cancer to multiple sclerosis and AIDS.'

Abbot called the system a 'glyconutrient sham.' 

Texas reached a settlement in 2009; Mannatech paid $4 million in restitution to customers in the state but wasn't required to admit any wrongdoing. The company's president paid a $1 million penalty and was banned from working for Mannatech for five years.

The company's employees were also barred from claiming 'directly or indirectly' that their products could 'cure, treat, mitigate or prevent any disease.'

Carson's work with Mannatech, however, extended until at least March 2014 when the YouTube video was published online.

The Texas lawsuit wasn't the only one.

In 2004 the mother of a boy with Tay-Sachs disease sued the company because the three-year-old had died in 1997 after being 'treated' with Mannatech products.

The suit alleged that after she confidentially provided a Mannatech sales associate with naked pictures of her son (in order to document his weight gain), he showed to an audience of hundreds during a Mannatech seminar.

'The sales associate was further accused of authoring an article, in the Journal of the American Nutraceutical Association in August 1997, explicitly claiming that Mannatech’s supplements had improved the boy’s condition,' National Review Online reported, 'even though the boy had, by that time, died.'

'The suit also presented evidence that Mannatech was still using photographs of the boy in promotional materials on its website in March 2004, "with the clear inference that [the boy] was alive and doing well some seven years after his actual death".'

That suit was settled for $750,000, according to public shareholder filings Mannatech made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company also agreed to stop using the child in its promotional material. 

Representatives for Carson, and for Vernon Robinson – the retired U.S. Army captain who runs the Draft Ben Carson for President Committee – did not respond to requests for comment.

The new scandal is hitting Carson while he's still reeling from last week's revelation that his 2012 book 'America the Beautiful' included sections plagiarized from other authors without citing them. 

MONEY MAN? Armstrong Williams, Carson's 'business manager,' was fied by his column's syndicator for accepting money from the Bush administration in exchange for hawking the No Child Left Behind program

Mannatech itself sells its products through multi-level marketing, a system that rewards existing salespeople for recruiting new ones by giving them a percentage of their 'down line' sales.

Other multi-level marketing schemes have been labeled 'scams' and 'frauds' by state governments.

Some whistle-blowers and fraud watchers refer to the sales systems as 'pyramid schemes' that benefit those at the top while making it hard for the newest sales team members to make a living because everyone above them gets a cut.

Carson's business manager, Armstrong Williams, has his own dodgy past, raising more questions about whether the company Carson keeps will render him unable to withstand the intense scrutiny of a presidential campaign in 2016.

Williams, who writes a column for The Washington Times, hosts a daily radio show and owns several radio and TV stations, was embroiled in a 2005 pay-for-play media scandal that almost ended his career.

USA Today reported then that he accepted $240,000 from the George W. Bush administration to promote the government's 'No Child Left Behind' (NCLB) education program in his broadcasts and weekly syndicated columns.

A government contract with the PR firm Ketchum specified that he had to 'regularly comment on NCLB during the course of his broadcasts.'

Tribune Media Services terminated his syndication deal after the scandal broke.
