Caroline Kennedy is asking for $45 million for the two parcels at her exclusive Red Gate Farm estate

Highly anticipated next U.S. ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy has put two pieces of land on Martha’s Vineyard up for sale.

The former first daughter is asking for a whopping combined asking price of $45 million for the two parcels at her exclusive Red Gate Farm estate.

Listed for $20 million, Lot 6 is described as nearly 40 acres of prime waterfront property in Aquinnah with ‘incredible views of Squibnocket Pond’ and the Atlantic Ocean.

'Plenty of privacy with varied topography and easy pond access. Yours to create a marvelous estate,' states the listing.

Lot 8, on the market for $25 million, consists of 50 acres of beachfront land and another 60 acres of protected oceanfront.

‘Simply magnificent is the only way to describe this pristine oceanfront parcel... a blank slate for your dream home... in this unique & beautiful location,’ states the listing.

Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis paid $1.1 million for the 366-acre parcel known as Red Gate Farm back in 1978.

The house she built, which Caroline currently owns, sits on about 106 acres of that plot.

In 2002 the rest of the land was subdivided into
six more lots, three for Caroline and her kids, two for estate expenses
and one preserved as open space. The lots 
cannot be further subdivided, island real estate blogger John O’Connell told The Boston Herald.

Martha's Vineyard is an island located south of Cape Cod in Massachusetts. It is well known as a popular destination for the rich and famous during the summer months.

Politicians and celebrities known to regularly visit the island, refereed to as 'Hollywood East' include U.S. President Barack Obama; former president Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; comedian and talk show host David Letterman; Bill Murray; Quincy Jones and Meg Ryan.

Although no official figure has been put on Kennedy's wealth, her net worth estimated to top $100 million. Tax records show Red Gate Farm is valued at nearly $40 million, but it would clearly be worth far more on the open market if these two plots have a starting price of $45 million.

Caroline Kennedy has reportedly been asked to serve as the next American ambassador to Japan.

Though she has been a perpetual consideration for a number of political posts over the years, this one comes at a personal cost as her husband Edwin Schlossberg will not be joining her in Tokyo as his design firm is based in New York.

Their 26-year marriage has been the subject of speculation over the years since they are rarely seen together, but they were seen enjoying a beach vacation in St Bart's with their two daughters earlier this year.

She has not officially announced her acceptance of the position but she is reportedly being vetted.

The Washington Post has reported that the appointment will be welcomed by the Japanese who have enjoyed having high profile ambassadors in the past.

Political stars like form vice president Walter Mondale and former House speaker Tom Foley have filled the post previously, but Caroline Kennedy will bring a new level of glamor to the job.

Kennedy, 55, has never actually held a governmental office, but just her name alone carries a great deal of weight in the political world.

She publicly toyed with the idea of 
running for the New York Senatorial seat left unfilled when Hillary 
Clinton stepped down to run for President in 2008, but Kennedy ended up 
withdrawing her nomination for 'personal reasons'.

Since
then, she has been an active Democratic cheerleader on the sidelines of
elections, supporting Barack Obama in both 2008 and then served as a 
national co-chair in the 2012 election.

If
the vetting process goes smoothly, she will join the ranks of other 
famous family members who have served as ambassadors for the U.S.

Her
grandfather Joe Kennedy was the Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 
1938 to 1940 during Franklin Delano Roosevelt's presidency.

Joe's
daughter, and Caroline's aunt, Jean Kennedy Smith served as the 
American Ambassador to Ireland from 1993 to 1998 during Bill Clinton's 
two terms in office.
