The ‘boomerang generation’ is growing as soaring numbers of young adults return home to live with their parents.

Three million have moved out of the family home for university or work – only to move back in again when independent living becomes too much of a hardship.

The numbers have swelled over the past 15 years as rising property prices and a stagnant jobs market make living with mum and dad more appealing to those in their 20s and 30s.

According to an analysis from the Office for National Statistics, nearly two million men and more than a million women aged between 20 and 35 live with their parents.

The number of adults who return to the family home after living elsewhere – known as ‘boomerang children’ – has risen by a fifth since 1997, with most attracted by the low cost of living.

One in three men aged 20 to 35 is still living with their parents, the ONS said.

Its report went on: ‘There are a number of reasons that might account for this growth in numbers living with parents, but it is noteworthy that the increase over the past decade coincides with an increase in the average price paid by first-time home-buyers of 40 per cent between 2002 and 2011.’

Tough: More and more young adults cannot afford to leave home and stay with parents until at least their mid-30s. Picture posed by models.

The phenomenon of boomerang children was first noticed in the early 2000s, when growing numbers of graduates were competing for work and rising house prices were putting property out of reach for many.

The latest figures, from the Government’s large-scale Labour Force Survey, reveal that 1.8million men and 1.1million women in their 20s and early 30s are living with their parents.

One in five men is living with his parents at the age of 28, and more than half of men do not leave the family home until they are 22. There are fewer women among the boomerang children because they are more likely to set up home with a partner at an earlier age – often picking a man who is older than them.

Women are also more likely to go to university and to move away from home to do so, and single mothers are more likely to become the main custodian of their children. According to the report, there are 643,000 women living in their own homes with their children as lone parents.

The report said: ‘Over 600,000 more women than men were lone parents in their own household. When relationships end, women are more likely to take caring responsibilities for any children.’

It added: ‘By the age of 34, only 7 per cent of men and 2 per cent of women were living with their parents. A couple of factors are associated with this age pattern. Firstly, average earnings of young people increase during their 20s and level off in their mid-30s.

‘Secondly, the likelihood of living with a partner is higher at older ages.’

Nearly two-thirds are living with someone by the time they are 31, the report said, and so can benefit from pooled income to cover rent or a mortgage.

The number of young adults who live with their parents was lowest in London, at fewer than one in five. The report said this was because of ‘the influx of young people from other regions and countries’. It was most common in Northern Ireland, at 35.3 per cent.

The report brought fresh calls for the Government to encourage older couples to move to smaller homes to create more housing space.

Angus Hanton of the Intergenerational Foundation campaign group, which has called for tax breaks for older people who move house, said: ‘The Coalition cannot continue to leave young people’s housing and employment prospects to a market stacked in favour of the older generation.’

Nearly three million young adults living at home in 2011, an increase of almost 500,000 since 1997

'Traditional' Northern Ireland has highest proportion because more do not leave their parents until they are married or settled-down

@highlight

40 per cent rise in average asking prices means that many more are saving for longer to get their first home

Not wanting to settle down or marry is the other main cause, especially among men

London has lowest numbers as so many come from elsewhere in Britain to work or study
