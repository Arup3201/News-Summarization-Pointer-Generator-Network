Swansea City expect to complete the signing of Tottenham full back Kyle Naughton on Thursday.

The 26-year-old is having a medical in south Wales on Wednesday, with talks over his personal terms ongoing. 

The transfer fee for the right back will be marginally under £5million - approximately the same amount they have been quoted by Spurs for midfielder Tom Carroll, who is on loan at the Liberty Stadium.

Naughton has played in only five games for Mauricio Pochettino this season and has been told he can leave.

But his ability to play on either side of defence appeals to Garry Monk, who is keen to strengthen at both left and right back.

Swansea’s existing left back Neil Taylor has struggled to fill the void left by Ben Davies’ summer departure for Tottenham and is a target for Crystal Palace. Meanwhile, long-serving right back Angel Rangel is 32 and there were doubts last months over his ability to play three games in a week.

Norwich left-back Martin Olsson is on Monk’s wishlist, though it is understood that his potential arrival would not have any bearing on whether they sign Naughton.
