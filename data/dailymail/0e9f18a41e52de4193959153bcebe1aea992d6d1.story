A police officer has been suspended for calling a memorial of toys, flowers a memorabilia left in honor of slain teen Michael Brown 'a pile of trash'.

Officer Timothy Zoll of the Ferguson police department denied making the dismissive remark after the memorial was hit by a car - but later admitted it and was punished.

The makeshift pile of items was built up by protesters in the middle of Canfield Drive in the Missouri town - the spot where Brown, 18, was gunned down by officer Darren Wilson in a now-infamous confrontation this August.

'Trash'? Officer Timothy Zoll insulted the memorial during a call with a reporter, the morning after it was hit by a car

Suspended: Zoll, who denied the comments but was later found out, has been placed on unpaid leave while superiors decide whether to punish him more. Above, the memorial soon after the car hit

It was purposefully hit by a car early Friday morning, according to supporters of Brown and his family.

The memorial was quickly rebuilt.

The inflammatory comments from Zoll, a public relations officer, came when Washington Post reporter Jose A. DelReal called the department to ask whether they were investigating.

Slain: The memorial was to Michael Brown, 18, who was killed in August in the Missouri town

In response to the query, Zoll said: 'I don’t know that a crime has occurred. But a pile of trash in the middle of the street? The Washington Post is making a call over this?'

He later denied making the comments, but changed his story after an investigation from Ferguson Police Department investigators.

His superiors placed him on unpaid leave while they decide whether to enact a more serious penalty.

A press release announcing his suspension said that Zoll 'admitted to Department investigators that he did in fact make the remarks attributed to him, and that he misled his superiors when asked about the contents of the interview.

'The officer has been placed on unpaid leave, effective immediately, while disciplinary proceedings begin.'

It added: 'The City of Ferguson wants to emphasize that negative remarks about the Michael Brown memorial do not reflect the feelings of the Ferguson Police Department and are in direct contradiction to the efforts of City officials to relocate the memorial to a more secure location.'
