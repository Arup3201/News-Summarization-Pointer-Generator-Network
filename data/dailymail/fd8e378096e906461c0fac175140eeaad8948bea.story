Up to 25 dogs and puppies have been killed in a huge blaze at a breeder's home in Yorkshire just days after more than 50 were killed in a similar fire in Manchester.

The Staffordshire bull terriers were kept in cages at the house of breeder Amanda Hart and her family. One man, believed to be a family member, had to be physically restrained from running into the blaze, Humberside fire service station manager Paul Clucas said.

'When the owner arrived back, he was obviously distraught and tried to get into the property to save the dogs. I had to physically restrain him for his own safety. There was no chance, flames were coming out of the hall and the roof,' he said.

Up to 25 dogs have been killed in  Hornsea, east Yorkshire after a fire at the home of Amanda Hart last night

The wooden structure was already well ablaze by the time firefighters reached the scene

The fire,  on Graingers Road, Hornsea, east Yorkshire, happened in a wooden-structured property, which was 'completely destroyed', a spokesperson for Humberside Fire and Rescue Service said.

The cause is not yet known.

Mrs Hart and her husband had put the dogs in cages and left to go to the supermarket when the fire engulfed their home and the kennels. The family are said to be fine, other than inhaling smoke while trying to save the animals.

They are now staying with her parents in a bungalow, it says on a Facebook page set up to raise money for the family which already has more than 900 likes.

The cause of the fire is currently unknown, but the dogs are believed to have died after inhaling toxic fumes

A message on the page, which calls on Staffordshire terrier lovers to unite and help Mrs Hart and her family, reads: 'She [Mrs Hart] has lost everything and as you can imagine her world has been taken from her.

'I feel at this moment in time we as friends and fellow Stafford lovers need to band together as one to help one of our own who has lost everything to help rebuild her life again. We as a breed have always shown when the chips are down for one of our own we would without hesitation provide the blanket of support which is so desperately needed at this time. I will with the help of other friends be putting in place various ways of donating money and household items to assist Amanda and her family to survive this tragedy.'

One commenter has offered to give Mrs Hart a puppy with the same bloodline as her dogs, so that the can continue to breed from the same family once her life has been set back up. 

And Eric Galvin, chairman of Merseyside Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club, has pledged £1,000, saying that he hopes 'this will open other clubs' bank accounts'. 

Firefighters reported the building to be 'well-alight' by the time they arrived, after being called shortly before 7pm yesterday - 18 attended the scene and stopped the fire from spreading further, but could not save any of the animals. 

The dogs are believed to have died after inhaling toxic fumes. 

A fundraising page set up last night has already raised more than £700 - exceeding the £500 target. 

Well-wishers donating to the tragic Manchester Dogs' Home saw more than £1.2 million pledged in less than 48 hours after the suspected arson attack on September 11.

A similar fire at Manchester Dogs' Home on September 11 killed 60 dogs, with another 150 rescued

X Factor judge Simon Cowell was one of many who donated to a fund to rebuild the shelter

Overwhelmed staff were forced to tell people donating supplies to stay away from its sister site in Warrington, Cheshire, after the weight of public benevolence caused tailbacks on the M6 motorway and around Warrington.

A 15-year-old boy arrested on suspicion of starting the blaze has since been released on bail.

After more than 30 firefighters began to tackle the blaze, hundreds of people rallied round to provide refreshments, animal food and other help for the dogs that were rescued.

The Hapurhey hire killed 60 dogs, while another 150 had to be rescued.

Dog-lover Simon Cowell was one of many who gave money to a fund which aims to rebuild the shelter, donating £25,000.

He also vowed to take the three men who rescued the surviving dogs from the blaze on a luxury holiday.

On Monday staff from the home, many of them dressed in uniform, joined around 300 members of the public and wept at Christ Church in Hapurhey, near the gutted dogs' home, as Reverend Mike McGurk led a service paying tribute to the animals.
