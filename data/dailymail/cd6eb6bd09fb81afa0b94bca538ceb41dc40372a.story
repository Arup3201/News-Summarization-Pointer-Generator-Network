Polymath: Dr Adrian Wrigley, 45, described by friends and peers as 'an absolute genius', has been found dead in Cambridgeshire

A brilliant Cambridge academic has been found dead after his partner was diagnosed with cancer.

Dr. Adrian Wrigley, 45, described by friends as having a brain 'the size of a planet', went missing from his mother's home in Hardwick, Cambridgeshire, on July 8.

Police confirmed his body was found in nearby woodland last Friday.

Lorna Evans, his girlfriend, wrote on a Facebook page set up in the wake of Dr Wrigley's disappearance how her partner was left distraught after she was diagnosed 
with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in June.

'Adrian was very upset with my health problems and is likely part of the reason he has disappeared,' her post said.

'Too much was coming at us, too fast,' added Ms Evans, who was with Dr Wrigley for 13 years.

The Facebook page said the academic was last seen at his mother's house on the evening of Sunday July 7.

The following day he was gone, having taken his bike and his rucksack with him.

'Adrian was in a poor emotional state, having had some bad news,' the post said.

Dr Wrigley gained a PhD in computer science at the University of Cambridge in 1994, and went on to design a revolutionary computer graphics chip.

After leaving the prestigious university Dr Wrigley founded his own company, Advanced Rendering Technology, before becoming a stock market trader.

He
later worked as an independent policy analyst focusing on the effects 
of tax and welfare policies on business, the environment and quality of 
life.

He also launched a
new business Match Markets with global ambitions to create an efficient
marketplace for local services, transport and labour.

Upset: Dr Wrigley's partner of 13 years Lorna Evans said he had been very upset to learn of her cancer diagnosis in June

'Exceptionally intelligent man': Friends and colleagues have been paying tribute to Dr Wrigley, who gained a PhD in computer science at the University of Cambridge before going on to found his own companies

Friend Simon Lane said Dr Wrigley was widely regarded as an 'absolute genius'.

He
said: 'He was an exceptionally intelligent man. So bright that we used 
to say we couldn't plumb the depths of his intelligence.'

Before his death Dr Wrigley was at the helm of the Systemic Fiscal Reform Group, an economic thinktank he founded in 2006.

The academic's Cambridge-based group argues that the country's taxation and monetary system is 'not fit for purpose', and seeks to find ways

Government should be run as a business serving all citizens  – its 'shareholders', the group says on its website.

'It should not be a charity for bankers, landowners, the very wealthy or the poor.'

Another friend, Dave Lloyd, wrote on the Find Adrian Wrigley Facebook page: 'Almost
the last thing Adrian said to me was that we have a moral imperative to
use our talents to improve the world.

'The world has lost a force for 
good with this news.'
