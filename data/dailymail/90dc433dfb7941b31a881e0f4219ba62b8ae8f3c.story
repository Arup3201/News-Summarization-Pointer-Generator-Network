Sunshine escapes are melting winter wonderlands when it comes to Britons’ holiday preferences as the UK descends into the dark, grey and cold period of the calendar.

An overwhelming 75 per cent of people say they want to thaw out in warmer climes instead of hitting the slopes over the next three months, reveals a survey of 2,400 people by Monarch Airlines.

Beach getaways make up 87 per cent of all of the carrier’s bookings over winter, leaving snow-destinations competition in the cold, with the airline adding flights to accommodate an increasing number of sun seekers.

Spanish resorts are as popular as ever with Alicante (16 per cent) and Malaga (12 per cent) in second and third with Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh (11 per cent) close behind.
