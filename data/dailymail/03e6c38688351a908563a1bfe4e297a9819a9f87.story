Victims and witnesses to crimes are to be warned they face a grilling over their private life after celebrities like Nigella Lawson compared their court experience to a 'witch-hunt'.

Under new plans by the country's top prosecutor, alleged victims and witnesses will be told if their sexual history is to be brought up and their reputation likely to be dragged through the mud when they take the stand.

Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), has published proposed guidance for prosecutors on the 'radical' new approach to prevent trial witnesses being ambushed by defence barristers in cross examination.

Nigella Lawson famously described her experience as a witness in the trial of her ex-husband Charles Saatchi's personal assistants as 'mortifying' and said it was like having 'a layer of skin removed'

The move comes after a number of high profile cases have raised questions about the treatment of prosecution witnesses.

Nigella Lawson famously described her experience as a witness in the trial of her ex-husband Charles Saatchi's personal assistants as 'mortifying' and said it was like having 'a layer of skin removed'.

The television chef was forced into a dramatic courtroom confession of drug-taking during the fraud trial of her two aides, Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo, who were accused of stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds from her and Mr Saatchi while in their service.

When asked about her marriage to the art dealer and taking cocaine she told Isleworth Crown Court there was a 'witch hunt' against her and that she was on trial with no counsel and 'no rights'.

She said: 'I did my civic duty, only to be maliciously vilified without the right to respond.'

Following the sensational trial which ended in her former aides being acquitted in December 2013, her brother Dominic Lawson likened her treatment to the burning of heretics in the Spanish Inquisition and warned that the 'vicious' treatment of prosecution witnesses is a threat to British justice because it could deter future witnesses from giving evidence.

But there are also concerns that under the new proposals, key witnesses could back out of giving evidence leading to prosecutions collapsing if they are forewarned pre-trial that defence barristers want to quiz them about embarrassing details of their personal life.

A number of other high-profile trials which saw prosecution witnesses subjected to intimate questions have caused outrage, including the parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler who were quizzed about porn magazines and bondage by a lawyer representing her killer Levi Bellfield during his trial.

Violinist Frances Andrade committed suicide in 2013 after giving evidence against a teacher who sexually abused her as a child.

Under the new plans, prosecutors will be able to tell witnesses and alleged victims the general nature of the defence case and point out material such as social services or medical records disclosed to the defence about them which could undermine the prosecution's case.

They should also be informed when permission has been granted to question them on aspects of 'bad character' or 'sexual history'.

But the guidelines, which will be put out for consultation for eight weeks, are expected to trigger debate among members of the criminal bar about the risk of 'coaching' witnesses and alleged victims - a practice that is forbidden.

Miss Saunders said: 'It's about testing their evidence but it's not about putting them on trial - they should remember that.

'There's no reason why witnesses should be ambushed.'

She said: 'It struck me more and more actually that on our side of the fence we chose to be in the criminal justice system, we know what to expect.

'They (alleged victims and witnesses) did not choose to be in the criminal justice system. They are all here for some dramatic event that happened to them. They have very little idea as to what will happen to them.'

She added: 'It doesn't really help confidence in the criminal justice system when victims and witnesses will say 'I wouldn't want to go through that again'.'

Victims' Commissioner Baroness Newlove, whose husband Garry was killed in August 2007 after he confronted a group of yobs outside his house, said: 'Most victims and witnesses don't know what to expect from a courtroom until it is too late.

'They are thrown into a highly intimidating situation through no fault of their own and then left with little or no explanation to help them through it.

'I've always been clear that there should be better CPS policy on pre-trial assistance and more information on what support is available.'

Attorney General Jeremy Wright said: 'Anyone who has gone through the ordeal of a court trial, especially victims who are called to give evidence as a witness, knows how daunting the process can be.

'This guidance will help witnesses understand what they can expect when they are in court and also explain the process for what happens next.'
