A four-month-old baby suffering from a rare bone abnormality is thriving despite doctors' gave him only weeks to live after he was born.

Joshua Adair was diagnosed with Jeune's Syndrome - a form of dwarfism - which stopped his ribcage from growing while he was in the womb.

Experts told Joshua's parents Mark and
Amanda that the tiny tot was unlikely to survive more than a couple of 
weeks due to the life threatening condition but months later he is about to undergo his first surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

Battle: Joshua is currently on oxygen 23-hours a day as his condition stops him taking a full breath

The syndrome, also known as Jeune 
thoracic dystrophy, is so rare there have only ever been 125 recorded 
cases in the world since it was first identified in 1955.

Children born with the condition are unable to engage in proper breathing as they have a small, bell-shaped chest preventing the lungs from growing normally.

Joshua currently survives on oxygen 23-hours a day and will face several operations to 
gradually reconstruct his ribcage so that he can live normally.

His father, Mark, said: 'Everyone 
warned us Joshua may not live but he has proved a wee fighter and 
battles on every day.

'To look at him you'd think he was thriving except
when you see his narrow chest.

'The surgery is his only hope and he will
face several operations as he grows, everything is pinned on it.'

Family: Baby Joshua with his mother Amanda and brother Ethan. He has remained in hospital since his birth and will undergo surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital to help correct his condition

Mark and his partner Amanda, who live in Stockport with their five-year-old son Ethan, were recovering from the loss of a baby girl Chloe last year when they discovered Amanda was pregnant again.

Chloe died in the womb just a few 
weeks before she was due and was stillborn.

Despite Amanda's 20-week scan 
revealing their new baby had problems, the couple decided to continue with the pregnancy.

He said: 'It was very difficult, 
Chloe died just before her due date and Amanda had to go through with 
the birth.

'Knowing something was wrong with this baby made it very hard.

'We were warned the baby might not survive and even if he did the outlook was bleak, now we are so grateful to have our boy.'

Survivor: Baby Joshua has beaten the odds to survive. This image shows how constricted his upper body is as a result of the rare condition.

Joshua has remained in his local hospital 
Stepping Hill, in Stockport since his birth in June but is expected to 
move to Great Ormond Street Hospital in the next couple of weeks.

Mark said: 'We have 
spoken to the surgeon at Great Ormond Street who has only seen 11 other 
cases in his 40 year career and he and his team are currently deciding 
the best materials to use on Joshua.

'We know its a tough road ahead and Joshua will face many operations but we have to give him every chance.'

Joshua's paediatrician at Stepping 
Hill Hospital, Dr Carrie Heal, said the condition was so rare it was 
almost never seen in children's hospitals in the UK.
