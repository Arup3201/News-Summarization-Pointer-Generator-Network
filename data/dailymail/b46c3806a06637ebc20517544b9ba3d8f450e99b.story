For years it was thought that the Ring Nebula -  an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other gases -  was shaped like a bagel.

This was also the basis for its 'Ring' nickname.

Yet in a new twist, latest images taken by Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope of the glowing gas shroud reveal it looks more like a jelly doughnut because it's filled with 'material in the middle.'

This new image shows the dramatic shape and colour of the Ring Nebula, otherwise known as Messier 57. From Earth's perspective, the nebula looks like a simple elliptical shape with a shaggy boundary. However, new observations combining existing ground-based data with new NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope data show that the nebula is shaped like a distorted doughnut

This image is a composite of the Ring Nebula. This combines new Hubble Wide Field Camera 3 data with observations of the nebula's outer halo from the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) in Arizona. In this image, the knotty, turbulent space around the nebula shows up dramatically, creating an almost psychedelic effect. The Large Binocular Telescope is part of the Mount Graham International Observatory in Arizona

Robert O'Dell of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee lead the research team. 

He said: 'The nebula is not like a bagel, but rather, it's like a jelly doughnut, because it's filled with material in the middle.'

O'Dell and his team used Hubble and several ground-based telescopes to get the best view yet of the iconic nebula.

The images show a more complex structure than astronomers once thought and have allowed them to construct the most precise 3D model of the nebula.

O'Dell continued: 'With Hubble's detail, we see a completely different shape than what's been thought about historically for this classic nebula.'

This diagram shows the geometry and structure of the Ring Nebula  as viewed side-on. This shows the nebula's wide halo, inner region, lower-density lobes of material stretching towards and away from Earth, and the prominent, glowing disc. This is composed of gas thrown off by a dying star at the centre of the nebular

'The new Hubble observations show the nebula in much clearer detail, and we see things are not as simple as we previously thought.'

The Ring Nebula is about 2,000 light-years from Earth and measures roughly 1 light-year across.

Located in the constellation Lyra, the nebula is a popular target for amateur astronomers.

Previous observations by several 
telescopes had detected the gaseous material in the ring's central 
region, but the new view by Hubble's sharp-eyed Wide Field Camera 3 
shows the nebula's structure in more detail.

O'Dell's team suggests the ring wraps around a blue, football-shaped structure.

Each end of the structure protrudes out of opposite sides of the ring.

The nebula is tilted toward Earth so astronomers see the ring face-on.

In the Hubble image, the blue structure is the glow of helium.

Radiation from the white dwarf star, the white dot in the centre of the ring, is causing the helium to glow.

The white dwarf is the stellar remnant of a sun-like star that has used up all its hydrogen fuel and has shed its outer layers of gas.

O'Dell's team was surprised at the 
detailed Hubble views of the dark, irregular knots of dense gas embedded
 along the inner rim of the ring, which look like spokes in a bicycle 
wheel.

These gaseous tentacles formed when expanding hot gas pushed into cool gas released by the doomed star.

The knots are less likely to be eroded by the ultraviolet light released by the star.

The Ring Nebula is about 2,000 light-years from Earth and measures roughly 1 light-year across.

All of the gas found in the centre of the nebula was expelled by the central star about 4,000 years ago.

The original star was several times more massive than our sun.

After billions of years converting hydrogen to helium in its core, the star began to run out of fuel.

It then ballooned in size, becoming a red giant.

During this phase, the star shed its 
outer gaseous layers into space and began to collapse as fusion 
reactions began to die out.

Ultraviolet light from the dying star energized the gas, making it glow.

The outer rings were formed when faster-moving gas slammed into slower-moving material.

The nebula is expanding at more than 43,000 miles an hour, but the centre is moving faster than the expansion of the main ring.

O'Dell's team measured the nebula's expansion by comparing the new Hubble observations with Hubble studies made in 1998.

The Ring Nebula will continue to expand for another 10,000 years, a short phase in the lifetime of the star.

The nebula will become fainter and fainter until it merges with the interstellar medium.

The Hubble images have allowed the team to match up the knots with the spikes of light around the bright, main ring, which are a shadow effect.

Astronomers have found similar knots in other planetary nebulae.

Studying the Ring Nebula's fate will provide insight into the sun's demise in another 6 billion years.

'When the sun becomes a white dwarf, it will heat more slowly after it ejects its outer gaseous layers.'

O'Dell added: 'The material will be farther away once it becomes hot enough to illuminate the gas. This larger distance means the sun's nebula will be fainter because it is more extended.'
