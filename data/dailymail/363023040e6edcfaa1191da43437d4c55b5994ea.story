Lance Armstrong brought home a bronze medal from the Sydney Games in 2000. He was stripped of the medal following his doping scandal

Lance Armstrong's given his Olympic medal back to the International Olympic Committee.

The committee stripped the American rider of the bronze medal from the 2000 Sydney Games in January after he admitted to doping.

After months of delays, Armstrong handed back the medal two weeks ago to the U.S. Olympic Committee.

The IOC said Wednesday it has 
received the medal from the USOC and placed it in storage at its 
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.

'Yes, we have it,' IOC spokesman Mark Adams told The Associated Press. 'It is in the vaults.'

The return of the medal marks 'the end of a sad chapter for the sport,' Adams said.

The IOC will not reallocate 
Armstrong's bronze medal, just as cycling's ruling body decided not to 
declare any winners for the seven Tour de France titles once held by the
 American.

Armstrong finished third in the road 
time trial in Sydney behind winner and U.S. Postal Service teammate 
Vyacheslav Ekimov of Russia and Jan Ullrich of Germany.

Spanish rider Abraham Olano Manzano, 
who finished fourth in Sydney, will not be upgraded and the bronze medal
 will be left vacant in Olympic records.

The medal Armstrong brought home after coming in behind Vyacheslav Ekimov (center) and Jan Ullrich is remaining open, although Spain's Abraham Olano Manzano completed the course in fourth place

Last year, the IOC stripped Tyler 
Hamilton, a former Armstrong teammate, of his time-trial gold medal from
 the 2004 Athens Olympics after he acknowledged doping.

In that case, Ekimov was upgraded to gold.

Armstrong denied doping for years 
until his confession in January in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. The 
confession came after a U.S. Anti-Doping Agency report detailed 
widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs by Armstrong and his USPS 
team.

Armstrong was stripped of the seven Tour de France titles he won from 1999-2005.
