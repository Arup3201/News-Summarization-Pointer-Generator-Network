Specs appeal: Singer Sir Elton John is reported to have requested a room just for his collection of glasses while touring Brazil

He's famed for his eccentric variety of outlandish glasses and is no stranger to the odd diva episode.

So it should come as no surprise that Sir Elton John is reported to have requested an extra hotel room on his current mini-tour of Brazil - just for his colourful collection of specs.

The star is currently on a four show tour of the South American country celebrating 40 years of his Rocket Man album.

And according to Brazil's Pampulha newspaper, the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road singer has told gig organisers in Belo Horizonte, south east Brazil, to reserve an extra room for his glasses collection.

The singer is also said to have stipulated that the room must be kept at a constant temperature of 16C and that his suite must be adorned with flowers.

He is believed to have demanded four two-metre high vases containing palm trees in his dressing room and seven other square vases, five containing 16 red roses and two with 16 white roses.

But Aluizer Malab, responsible for Sir Elton's March 9 show at the city's Mineirao football stadium, said that nothing is too much trouble for tour organisers.

He said: 'In general, he isn't that eccentric. They are reasonable requests. He is a very disciplined artist.'

A spokesman for the singer denied the claim, insisting it was not true.

The 65-year-old, real name Reg Dwight, is reportedly no stranger to making particular requests when on the road.

It has previously been reported that he demands a dressing room big enough to comfortably hold ten people with ample seating including a 6ft sofa, a 'love seat', an armchair and a selection of easy chairs.

He is usually said to be adamant that floral displays should have 'absolutely no chrysanthemums, daisies, carnations or lilies'.

Sir Elton is hardly the first popstar to make unusual requests however.

Robbie Williams reportedly once demanded kumquats, a bonsai tree, four ashtrays, clean underwear and a framed photo of former Blockbusters presenter Bob Holness on the wall.

Eccentric singer Lady Gaga apparently once insisted that her 150-strong entourage, which included a spiritualist, masseuse, tarot reader and 30 stylists, had plenty of 'non-smelling and non-sweaty' cheese on ice and that the entire backstage area be bleached prior to the diva's performance.

According to Rolling Stone magazine in Brazil, Sir Elton has said that he would like to eat traditional Brazilian food while in the country.

As well as appearing in Belo Horizonte, Sir Elton is also performing in Porto Alegre tonight and Brasilia.

Tickets for the shows range from $50 to $1,000.
