Manchester United are closing on Juventus' Chilean midfielder Arturo Vidal, who is valued at £35m.

Vidal has insisted he would love to play for one of the biggest clubs in the world and will sort his future when he arrives back from his holidays.

Patrice Evra has already agreed to move in the other direction.

No go: Vidal's move to Man United from Juventus is set to not go ahead this summer

After featuring in Chile's impressive 
World Cup campaign, Vidal is being chased by new United boss Louis van 
Gaal, and the Dutchman should step up efforts when he returns from his 
duty at the World Cup.

Speaking to Chilean newspaper La Tercera about a potential move to United, Vidal said: 'I've heard about the rumours, but I haven't spoken more about this subject.

'I'm enjoying my holidays, and when I return to Italy I'll see what happens.

'I'm very calm, but anyone would love to play for one of the biggest clubs in the world.'

United have already signed Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw, with Van Gaal looking to have a more successful summer than David Moyes had last term.

Misfit striker Bebe is the subject of enquiries from Benfica after impressing on loan at Pacos de Ferreira.
