When it senses danger, Earth sends out huge plumes of plasma to protect itself against devastating solar storms.

And now, for the first time, scientists have been able to watch this incredible process using satellites and ground-based detectors.

The discovery confirms age-old theories about the Earth's magnetic field and could provide scientists with a way to better to model the planet’s natural shield. 

Spacecraft have observed how dense particles can 'snake up' along magnetic field lines as cold plasma

Earth’s protective field, known as the magnetosphere, extends thousands of miles into space affecting everything from global communication to animal migration.

When the sun's magnetic field directly links with Earth's, it can create cracks in the magnetosphere allowing solar winds to punch holes into the ozone layer.

Usually this creates auroras in the sky, but it can also knock out power grids, radically change Earth’s climate and drive up rates of cancer.

A thin layer of cold, dense material called the plasmasphere surrounds Earth. Researchers have found that material in the plasmasphere can help prevent particles from the sun crossing into near Earth space

The Earth's plasmasphere is an inner part of the magneteosphere - the protective magnetic bubble are Earth.

It is a region of dense, cold plasma that surrounds the Earth. Although plasma is found throughout the magnetosphere, the plasmasphere usually contains the coldest plasma.

In certain circumstances dense particles in the plasmasphere send a 
plume up to meet – and help block – incoming solar material.

‘It’s like what you might do if a monster tried to break into your house,’ said Brian Walsh, a space scientist at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center.

‘You’d stack furniture up against the front door, and that’s close to what the Earth is doing here.

‘The material that is usually much nearer Earth stacks up against the outer boundary of the magnetosphere, throttling the interaction there and stopping solar material from entering.’

While ground-based measurements can see a plume forming, their resolution isn't good enough to confirm whether the material reaches the magnetic boundary.

In January last year, GPS sensors on the ground mapped electrons in the upper atmosphere and saw a tendril of electron density moving away from the North Pole.

Through sheer luck, three of Nasa's Themis spacecraft, which are designed to study solar storms, crossed through the magnetic boundary at that very moment.

The Themis craft saw a 100-fold increase in the number of electrons at the boundary, indicating that a plume of plasma was veering off towards the sun.

Eventually these observations could lead to improvements in space weather predictions, which would be as useful for spacecraft operators as terrestrial weather forecasts are for us here on Earth.
