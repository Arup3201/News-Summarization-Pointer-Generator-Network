The Tories have refused to rule out cutting the education budget by billions of pounds after the next election, private briefing notes have revealed.

Documents photographed being held by Conservative veteran William Hague during a press conference yesterday showed ministers were urged not to answer questions about whether school funding would be slashed.

It comes after the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg accused the Tories of planning a 25 per cent reduction to the education budget to pay for ‘remorseless’ spending cuts.

A close up of William Hague's briefing notes revealed that the Tories are refusing to rule out cutting the schools budgets

In response to the question ‘Will you cut the schools budget in the next Parliament’, the document said: ‘Of course there will be difficult decisions in the next Education budget in the next Parliament'

He said: ‘Tory plans mean education will have to be cut by a quarter by 2020. And that's just one unprotected department.’

Mr Clegg said the schools budget had only been protected since 2010, ‘because the Lib Dems fought for it’.

In the Autumn Statement last year, George Osborne revealed public spending cuts would continue for at least three years after the election to eliminate the deficit.

The Office of Budget Responsibility said the cuts would take state spending to a level not seen since the 1930s.

During a press conference yesterday, five Conservative ministers lined up to attack Labour spending plans.

George Osborne, Nicky Morgan, Theresa May, Sajid Javid and William Hague claimed Ed Miliband had committed Labour to £20billion of unfunded spending commitments.

During the press conference Mr Hague was photographed looking at a briefing document for the event – including a passage informing ministers what to say if questioned about Conservative school spending proposals.

In response to the question ‘Will you cut the schools budget in the next Parliament’, the document said: ‘Of course there will be difficult decisions in the next Education budget in the next Parliament.

‘In this Parliament, we've shown that we can protect the front line by making the Education budget more efficient and effective.

‘We can only have strong schools by staying on the road to a stronger economy. But putting the economy at risk because Ed Miliband doesn't have an economic plan, Labour would put our schools at risk.

However it added: ‘If pressed: There will be decisions for future spending reviews.’

Liberal Democrat Schools Minister David Laws said the document exposed the scale of the Conservative cuts programme.

He said: ''The Tories have now revealed their true colours for all to see.

'They want to slash spending on education that’s desperately needed to provide children a fair and equal opportunity to succeed.

'A Tory-shaped £13.3bn black hole in education spending will jeopardise future job prospects for our country’s children, and jeopardise our long term economic stability.'
