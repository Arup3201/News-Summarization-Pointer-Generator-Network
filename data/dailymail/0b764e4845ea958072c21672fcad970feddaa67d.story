British singer James Blunt has said he wants to become a Swiss citizen after living in the tax-friendly country for the past five years.

'As soon as the authorities will let me, because I don’t know if I’ve been here a sufficiently long time, I would like to become Swiss,' he told a Swiss newspaper recently.

'Verbier is my home,' said the 38-year-old multi-millionaire, who bought a chalet in the ski resort in 2005.

Singer, songwriter, skier, foodie: James Blunt wants to become a permanent citizen of tax-friendly Switzerland because he 'loves skiing and good food'

Singer, songwriter, skier, foodie: James Blunt wants to become a permanent citizen of tax-friendly Switzerland because he 'loves skiing and good food.'

He made a guest appearance in town on Saturday.  He opened a restaurant called The Cow, according to Swiss media.

Blunt said opening the restaurant - nearly 9,000 feet up a mountain with stunning views - was a dream come true.

'I love skiing and good food,' he said, adding: 'I am a horrible cook'.

Former British army officer Blunt, who once headed up the Household Cavalry alpine ski team in Verbier, is a man with snow in his veins. 

He became a champion skier of the army's  Royal Armoured Corps.

Blunt has mooted a career break in the past.  He rocketed to stardom in

2005 with his Back to Bedlam album and, since there, his other works have sold over 18 million copies worldwide.

'Verbier is my home': Blunt said his New Year's Eve plans would involve running around the picturesque resort 'disguised as a cow'

Meanwhile, Blunt revealed his unusual plans for New Year’s Eve: 'I want to run around the resort disguised as a cow.'

It might take his mind off ugly rumours that surfaced in the UK last month linking him to a tax scandal, insisting attempts to question his contribution to the nation's finances are a 'witch-hunt'.

The You're Beautiful star hit headlines when it emerged his name was on a leaked list of HSBC bank customers with an offshore account on the Channel Island of Jersey.

The list, which also contains the identities of several other high-profile Brits, has sparked a tax probe by officials at Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, but Blunt is adamant his banking practices are legitimate and insists he pays his fair share into the UK's public purse.

In a post on Twitter.com, the singer wrote; 'I have an account at HSBC Jersey which has always been declared to HMRC, and I pay my taxes. Witch-hunt.'
