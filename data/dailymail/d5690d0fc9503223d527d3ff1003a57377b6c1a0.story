It has been less than 24 hours since Monica Lewinsky stepped back into the spotlight for the first time in 13 years and told a conference that she 'fell in love with her boss'.

But for Bill and Hillary Clinton it was business as usual as they continued on the campaign trail of Democratic candidates ahead of the mid-term elections - and seemingly ignored the comments by the former White House intern. 

The couple were hundreds of miles apart. The former President was in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, backing Senator Mary Landrieu while his wife was in California, attending fundraisers in San Francisco and Los Angeles alongside the likes of Cameron Diaz. 

Neither mentioned the  affair that took place 15 years ago or the comeback of the 41-year-old who signed up to Twitter for the first time on Monday, hours before her teary-eyed speech at a Forbes conference in Philadelphia.

Clinton described Landrieu as one of the Senate's most bipartisan and effective lawmakers, offering a high-profile campaign boost Monday to the incumbent ahead of the start of the state's early voting period.

After the high-profile backing, he then had time to pose for a number of selfies with members of the audience.  

Clinton sought to combat GOP claims that Landrieu was too closely tied to Democratic leadership in Washington and didn't represent her home state's values.

'This is not a close question of who would do the best job. She should be winning this race,' Clinton told a packed hotel ballroom of 1,500 attendees.

The three-term senator faces a tough re-election bid, targeted for ouster by Republicans nationally in their effort to regain Senate control. Landrieu's main GOP opponent is U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy.

Landrieu's campaign hopes Clinton's star power and continued popularity help sway undecided voters and bolsters minority turnout in the November 4 election. Early voting begins Tuesday.

Cassidy and Republican leaders repeatedly link Landrieu to President Barack Obama, who is unpopular in Louisiana, suggesting a vote to return Landrieu to Washington is like voting for Obama. Landrieu has tried to distance herself from the president, saying the election is about the future of Louisiana.

Cheerful: The former President couldn't help but smile as he stood at the podium in Louisiana and backed incumbent Senator Mary Landrieu

Serious: The former Secretary of State speaks at a fundraiser for Democratic congressional candidates hosted by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco 

Hug: She was embraced by the former speaker during the event which raised over $1million for the Democrats

Star appearance: Cameron Diaz was one of the representatives fro  Hollywood who attended the second fundraiser of the evening at  the Tavern restaurant in Los Angeles 

No ring: She was spotted with an engagement ring on. Rumors had circulated earlier this month that she had gotten engaged to Benji Madden 

Fashionable departure: Eva Longoria was also spotted leaving the event at the Tavern Restaurant 

Cassidy's campaign didn't comment on Clinton's appearance in Baton Rouge, while the Republican National Committee discarded it, saying Landrieu was no longer a 'Clinton Democrat.'

'Landrieu's rock solid support for President Obama shows that his agenda is her agenda, and Louisiana voters can see through today's misdirection,' RNC spokesman Ben Voelkel said in a statement.

Clinton largely steered clear of talk about the Obama administration, instead describing Landrieu's work to get Louisiana a greater share of offshore oil drilling royalties and her chairmanship of the Senate energy committee.

This is Clinton's second visit to Louisiana for Landrieu. He's a popular draw on the campaign trail for vulnerable Democrats across the South, attending events in Arkansas on Sunday and planning a rally in Kentucky on Tuesday.

As he waded through the crowds, Mr Clinton stopped to pose for a selfie with an audience member

'I feel like an old race horse, and I'm retired up here in this stable, you know. And all of a sudden at election time, they come and bring me an extra bale of hay and then they put the reins on, take me out to the track, slap me on the rear and see if I can make it around just one more time,' he joked.

Louisiana's Senate race is unlikely to be decided in two weeks. If no candidate in the eight-person field gets more than 50 percent of the vote, the race will be settled in a December 6 runoff. Polls show Cassidy with a slight lead in runoff scenarios.

The former First Lady started her day of campaigning in San Francisco. She urged Democratic voters not to be complacent about the November midterm elections, saying working women and their families will lose out on a better future if Republicans gain control of both houses of Congress.

According to ABC San Francisco she made the remarks during a sold-out women’s luncheon hosted by House Democratic Leader and former speaker Nancy Pelosi that raised $1.4 million for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

By the time Lewinsky concluded her emotional presentation on the perils of public humiliation in the digital age, the Twitter-sphere was abuzz with excitement over Lewinsky’s apparent comeback, showering her with praise for her courage.

Lewinsky, 41, joined Twitter less than two hours before taking the stage at the Forbes conference, where she was invited to speak about the ‘scourge of harassment in the digital age.’

‘Overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one. I was Patient Zero, the first person to have their reputation completely destroyed worldwide via the Internet,’ Ms Lewinsky told a rapt crowd in a room where, according to multiple eyewitness accounts shared on Twitter, one could hear a pin drop.

Lewinsky, best known worldwide for her sordid affair with President Bill Clinton, did not mince words when addressing that part of her biography.

‘Sixteen years ago, fresh out of college...I fell in love with my boss,’ Lewinsky declared from the stage in Philadelphia, before launching into an impassioned speech about the price she had been forced to pay for her youthful indiscretion.
