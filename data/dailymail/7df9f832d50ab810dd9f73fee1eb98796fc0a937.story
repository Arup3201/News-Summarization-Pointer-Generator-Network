In hospital: Gia Allemand, pictured in May, is currently in hospital in critical condition

Bachelor contestant Gia Allemand is in 'critical condition' after being rushed to hospital on Monday night.

The 29-year-old, who appeared on season 14 of The Bachelor, was taken to University Hospital in New Orleans following a 'serious medical event,' according to a statement released by her representative.

A source confirmed to MailOnline early on Wednesday that Gia is on life support.

The details of the medical emergency are currently not known, as first reported by Radar.

Gia went on to find love after The Bachelor and has been dating NBA Basketball Player Ryan Anderson
of the New Orleans Pelicans.

The sports star and her mother have been by Gia's side in hospital since last night after Anderson made a mercy dash to be with her as soon as he heard the news.

Meanwhile a source at the New Orleans Pelicans, today told MailOnline: 'Ryan is with her now at the hospital. It's a tough situation for everybody to deal with and it was definitely unexpected.

'We don't know what exactly happened and we are hoping to speak to her doctors to find out.'

Gia's representative said: 'On behalf of the family, we kindly ask for privacy at this time.'

Melinda Farina, a friend of Gia, tweeted late last night that the model was 'on life support w [sic] little pulse and barely breathing ..cause unknown'. Next 48 hours critical please pray for Gia everyone.'

Then later she tweeted: 'I'm so sad about my best friend right now...how could this have happened to such an incredible person..she needs to come out of it!

'Everyone I will keep you posted if I hear anything further right now it's not good-we all need to stay positive though she's tiny but strong.'

She wrote on Instagram earlier today: 'Deep Prayers to my best friend @GiaAllemand who is in #ICU on life support right now.'

She also told one particular fan that the incident 'could have been an adverse reaction to something'.

But, the source who confirmed that Gia is on life support also said the unexplained event was not an adverse reaction.

Gia's rep said a statement would be released at some time today.

The 29-year-old almost made it to the final on the Jake Pavelka season of the hit ABC show, losing out to Vienna Girardi.

Jake tweeted last night: 'Please pray for @GiaAllemand... A dear friend and one of the sweetest women I know... #powerofprayer.'

Gia, a model and actress, later joined the cast of reality series Bachelor Pad in 2010 but only made it to the third episode.

She always maintained that she entered the reality show in the genuine hope to find true love.

'I truly went on the show to find love!' she told Emme magazine.

'A few months before going on The Bachelor my boyfriend broke my heart. I couldn’t date or meet anyone.  I was in such a rut so my friends submitted me for The Bachelor.'
