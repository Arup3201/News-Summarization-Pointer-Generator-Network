Prince William has further signalled he is likely to take on a senior royal role by the end of the year after agreeing to inherit one of his grandfather’s most cherished patronages.

The Duke of Edinburgh, 91, today announced he was retiring as president of Fields in Trust after 64 years in favour of 30-year-old William, who is expected to announce he will quit his job as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot later this month.

The organisation, formerly the National Playing Fields association, was one of the first patronages Prince Philip took on in 1947 when he married the Queen and is dear to his heart.

A spokesman for the charity, which was set up in 1925 by King George V, said: 'During this time, despite the continuing pressure to dispose of playing fields, the number of fields protected by Fields in Trust has grown from 430 sites covering 3,300 acres to 2,871 sites covering 28,865 acres. 

'This could not have been done without the support and help of His Royal Highness.

‘As with any organisation there have been difficult periods but His Royal Highness, with his unique knowledge of the organisation, has always been there to help and assist in many different ways: not least his valuable and constructive ideas which will be missed more than anything else.

‘Fields in Trust owes an enormous debt to His Royal Highness and it is very difficult to express properly the sense of gratitude and appreciation for all that His Royal Highness has done for the charity.

'Without his help and contribution the organisation could not have achieved what it has done if, indeed, it still existed as an independent charity.’

The spokesman said it was an 'honour' that Prince William – who spearheaded their Diamond Jubilee campaign, the Queen Elizabeth 11 Field Challenge - had decided to succeed his grandfather of the charity.

Chief executive Helen Griffiths said: 'The Duke of Edinburgh’s support during his 64 year presidency has been outstanding – from his appearance in a film to promote our work back in 1950 to his annual recognition of volunteers through the President’s Certificates – and we are immensely grateful for all he has done for us.

'We’re delighted that The Duke of Cambridge has agreed to succeed his grandfather as president, continuing the charity’s long association with the Royal Family, and are looking forward to being able to do even more to safeguard outdoor spaces for sport and play with his ongoing backing.’

A spokesman for the prince added: 'Following The Duke of Cambridge’s patronage of the very successful Queen Elizabeth II Fields Challenge, he is delighted to take on the presidency of Fields in Trust.

'The Duke of Cambridge shares The Duke of Edinburgh's passion to safeguard outdoor spaces for future generations.’

Today St James's Palace also announced that the Duchess of Cambridge, would undertake another royal first as she helps to name her first cruise liner.

On one of her last public engagements 
before she goes on maternity leave awaiting the birth of her first 
child, she will become 'godmother' of the Royal Princess at a naming 
ceremony in Southampton on Thursday, June 13.

The
ceremony will involve a blessing, the celebratory tradition of smashing
a bottle over the hull of the ship and a performance by the Royal 
Marines Band and the pipers of the Irish Guards.

The Duchess will also board the ship for a brief tour.

The Duchess of Cambridge will name a cruise liner in June, St James's Palace announced today

Kate will follow then lead of her mother-in-law Diana, Princess of Wales, who named a Royal Princess ship in 1984

The original Royal Princess luxury cruise liner was launched in in Southampton in November 1984  by the late Princess Diana.

The new floating stately pleasure-dome is the first of a new ‘Royal’ class  of vessel and has cost half a billion pounds to build – four times the £125million cost of the original Royal Princess – and includes 200 tons of marble.

At 1,083ft, it is longer than The Shard and has the world’s largest floating outdoor cinema and pizzeria as well as a bar serving 75 different Martinis.
