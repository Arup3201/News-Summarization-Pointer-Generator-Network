This is the shocking moment when a policeman shot an unarmed man during a traffic stop for not wearing a seatbelt. 

Sean Groubert, 31, who as a South Carolina State Trooper at the time of the incident shot Levar Jones on September 4 on Broad River Road, in Richmond County, Columbia.

Groubert ordered Mr Jones to show his driving licence. When he reached into his car to retrieve the document, Groubert started shouting and opened fire with his semi-automatic handgun.

Groubert shouted: 'Get out of the car', before discharging two rounds in quick succession. One of the bullets went through the side window of Mr Jones' car and continued through the front window of a nearby filling station. 

As Mr Jones retreated from the car, he raised his hands when Groubert fired two more shots, one of which wounded him in the hip. 

The video was shot from a camera mounted to the dashboard of Groubert's patrol car. 

Groubert told Mr Jones: 'Well, you dove head-first back into your car. Then you jumped back out. I'm telling you to get out of your car.' 

According to court documents released by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, Groubert has been charged with 'Assault / Assault and Battery of a High and Aggravated Nature'.

According to the arrest warrant: 'On September 4, 2014 while at 3004 Broad River Road, in the Dutch Fork Magisterial District of Richland County, the defendant did commit the crime of Assault and Battery of a High and Aggravated Nature because the defendant, a South Carolina State Trooper at the time of the incident, did without justification unlawfully shoot Levar Jones which produced great bodily injury or was likely to cause great bodily injury. Audio and visual recordings, as well as written statements, obtained are further evidence to indicated the shooting incident without justification.

According to a video, Groubert fires two rounds in quick succession towards Mr Jones at the gas station 

As Mr Jones retreats with his hands up, Groubert fires two more rounds before handcuffing him on the floor 

SCLED confirmed that upon conviction, Groubert faces up to 20 years in prison. 

However, his lawyer Barney Giese told WISTV.com that his client was pleaded not guilty to the charge, claiming that Groubert was justified in shooting Jones, who reached for his licence 'aggressively'.

Groubert was bailed after he posted a $75,000 bond and is expected to reappear in court on October 24.
