She's better known for her rock n' roll image but on the front of Vs. 
Magazine's newest issue Courtney Love turns cabaret star.

The singer, 49, appears dressed in vintage-style lingerie, high heels and a top hat in a seeming tribute to Liza Minnelli's racy character in the 1972 film musical Cabaret.

Demonstrating that famous rebellious streak, Ms Love tops off the look with bedhead hair, smokey eye make-up and a cigarette to hand.

Ms Love's Vs. Magazine cover, which carries the strapline 'playful', is one of four and all are set to hit newsstands this September.

Actress Eva Green stars on another of the covers, with her shot taking inspiration from the film poster for Stanley Kubrick's 1962 movie adaptation of Lolita.

She is seen gazing at the camera while seductively sucking on an 'I love you' heart-shaped lollipop.

And fellow supermodels Hailey Clauson and Luma Grothe pose together with their legs intertwined on the fourth cover.

Though most of the leading ladies were photographed in New York, Ms 
Green was snapped at the Musée des Arts Forains - a private museum of 
funfair objects - in her hometown, Paris.

Vs. Magazine, which describes itself as a 'curated & emotional view on fashion and culture', is known for its quirky aesthetic.

Paris Hilton, Eva Mendes, Kate Bosworth and January Jones, are among the celebrities to have appeared in its pages.
