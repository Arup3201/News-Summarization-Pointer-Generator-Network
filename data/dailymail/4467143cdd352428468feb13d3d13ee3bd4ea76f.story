A legal stoush between two of Australia's most popular social media personalities is over after the parties settled outside court.

Leanne Ratcliffe - better known as 'Freelee the Banana Girl - and her partner Harley Johnstone promised a court they will not disparage popular Instagram personality Kayla Itsines, 23, online. 

Ms Itsines, the 23-year-old behind the Bikini Body Guide fitness program, lodged an injunction against the pair in March after alleging the couple posted 'defamatory' remarks on YouTube last month.

In a fiery Facebook post addressed to her followers, Ms Itsines said she was taking court action because of 'false claims that my partner takes steroids' and 'claims I'm starving myself or other people'. 

She argued she was 'standing up for myself, friends and family' in bringing the lawsuit.

On Tuesday morning, lawyers told the South Australian Supreme Court that the parties had successfully reached a deal in the last week. 

Under the terms of the agreement, Ms Ratcliffe and Mr Johnstone will be barred from making disparaging statements about Ms Itsines in social, print or electronic media. 

After the court hearing Ms Itsines' lawyer, Mike Hayes from Lynch Meyer, told Daily Mail Australia the parties had agreed on amended terms of an injunction Ms Itsines had lodged on March 2.

Judge Brian Withers made the orders permanent this morning. He also scheduled a further hearing in May to ensure the orders were carried out. 

The case will not proceed to trial. Outside court, Ms Ratcliffe told South Australian newspaper The Advertiser that she would abide by the terms of the deal.  

'Recalling every detail of it (the settlement) is a little difficult, but I understand it and I will follow it,' she was quoted saying. 

More than a hundred Banana Girl supporters crowded outside court last week, reportedly chanting 'carb the f*** up'. 

In a YouTube video posted at the weekend, Ms Ratcliffe told her followers: 'I'm not stressed. I know good will prevail.'
