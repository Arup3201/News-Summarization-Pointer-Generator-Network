These are the amazing photographs when a giant crocodile eats an entire goose with one swift bite. 

The Egyptian goose was taking a drink at a watering hole inside the Kruger National Park in South Africa, completely unaware of the danger lurking beneath the water. 

Photographer Gideon Jordaan from Pretoria was following some hippos when the unexpected attack happened. 

In a fraction of a second, the crocodile pounced, capturing the goose between its powerful jaws, crushing the helpless bird.

The powerful crocodile began eating the goose head-first, chomping down on its body, crushing the unfortunate bird to death

Commenting on his good fortune, Mr Jordaan said: 'I didn't see the croc before the strike but once he had caught the goose there was plenty of time to snap away.

'As with most wildlife photography, your time is spent sitting and waiting at waterholes waiting for something to come down to the water to drink, and this day was no different.

'On this hot afternoon there was only a few Impala drinking and two Egyptian Geese feeding at the side of the water.

'I was photographing a pod of hippos in the middle of the dam when I heard a commotion closeby.

'I looked up from my camera's viewfinder only to see a massive crocodile with one of the Egyptian Geese in its jaws.

'After the croc had the geese in its massive jaws it started swallowing the bird and this gave me the opportunity to get some pictures.' 

After goose stops struggling, the photographs clearly show blood trickling down the side of the crocodile's jaw and into the water
