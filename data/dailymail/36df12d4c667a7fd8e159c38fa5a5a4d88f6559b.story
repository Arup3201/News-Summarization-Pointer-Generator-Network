Hundreds of victims of the civil war in Syria will be able to come to Britain as refugees in the coming months, ministers confirmed yesterday.

The offer will be targeted at the most vulnerable people including orphaned children, women and girls at risk of sexual violence, survivors of torture and those with disabilities.

Home Secretary Theresa May announced the resettlement scheme yesterday and Britain could be ‘proud’ of its support for Syrians facing ‘appalling violence and suffering.’

The deal was struck after weeks of talks with the Liberal Democrats about how to respond to the Syrian conflict which has raged for almost three years.

Nick Clegg said Britain had a ‘moral responsibility’ to help alleviate suffering in the region where more than 100,000 people have died and millions displaced from their homes.

Last week immigration minister Mark Harper claimed that resettling a small number of refugees was ‘token’ given the scale of the crisis, but yesterday Mrs May confirmed the government’s change of heart.

She said there was no specific target for the number who would be admitted but expected it to be several hundred. The United Nations will help identify the most traumatic cases.

Mrs May said: ‘Some of the worst abuses in the Syrian conflict involve the use of sexual violence including in regime detention centres. We will be providing emergency sanctuary to people who are most at risk including victims of torture and violence’.

The deal was welcomed by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees which has called on countries outside the region to take in 30,000 Syrians in the greatest need.

So far Western countries have agreed to take 18,000, of which Germany has agreed to take 10,000, France to take 500 and the United States has put no cap on the number they will take.

In response to pressure from Labour, the home secretary said Britain had already made a major contribution as the second largest aid donor to the region having given £600million.

more than 11.5million people inside Syria and those who have fled to 
neighbouring countries are in urgent need of food, shelter and medical 
treatment

Around 1,100 Syrians have already come to Britain as refugees last year under a different programme.

Mrs May added: ‘The greatest need is in the region and it is there that the United Kingdom can make the largest impact’. Britain is providing food, shelter and medical aid to hundreds of thousands of people in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon. 

Several MPs speaking in the parliamentary debate on Britain’s response to the conflict yesterday compared it to the Kindertransport scheme rescuing children from Nazi Germany in the months before the war broke out. 

But Tory backbencher Andrew Bridgen accused David Cameron of ‘political posturing’.

He said Britain had donated more in aid than the rest of the EU put together and that admitting a few hundred people would make little difference to such a vast refugee crisis.

‘I think that people can see the political expediency of the u-turn’, he told the BBC.
