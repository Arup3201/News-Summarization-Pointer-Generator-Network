Prince Harry enjoyed his first Arabian banquet tonight courtesy of the Omani royal family - many of whom joined him for the event.

The fourth-in-line to the throne was the guest of honour at a lavish dinner at the Ritz-Carlton Al Bustan Palace Hotel in the capital Muscat.

His host at the opulent venue, set in the shadows of the Hajjar Mountains, was His Highness Sayyid Haithem Bin Tariq Al Said, the Sultan of Oman's first cousin.

Charmed: The royal was introduced to a series of local dignitaries ahead of the banquet

After being introduced to a small group of royals and dignitaries, which included one woman - the under-secretary to Minister of Tourism, Sheikh Abdulmalik bin Abdullah bin Ali al Khalili - Harry was shown to the table, which was laden with flowers and silver cutlery.

On the menu was a vermicelli soup with garlic, fried fillets of sole, Omani-style local fish and several lamb dishes with bowls of dates and Middle Eastern salads.

Each place setting had a goblet of water and one of orange juice, but no alcohol was served.

The prince arrived in Muscat this morning for a three day official visit, after which he flies onto Abu Dhabi where he will play in a charity polo match on Thursday.

The smartly-dressed royal was greeted off his overnight scheduled flight from London by the Sultan's cousin.

The two men then posed for a brief photocall in typical Middle Eastern style, sitting on two chairs in an elaborately gilded lounge underneath the sword and dagger symbol of the Omani Sultanate.

Harry told his royal host: 'I send best wishes from Her Majesty. She is very well.'

He was offered coffee and a traditional sweet treat with almonds known as halwa, before leaving to meet staff at the British Embassy.

Harry is staying in the desert kingdom at the private invitation of Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said - a Sandhurst educated Anglophile - and had been due to attend a National Day celebration today in his honour.

Unfortunately the Omani leader is currently receiving medical treatment in Germany for an undisclosed illness, meaning the parade will now no longer take place.

According to Kensington Palace, The Diwan - the Royal Court - in Oman - was still keen for the royal visit to take place, however, and Harry will continue with his plans.

At the invitation of the Sultan he was taken on a boat trip in the afternoon to the picturesque Dimaniyat Islands Nature Reserve, 70 kilometres west of Muscat.

Royal welcome: Harry was met by HH Sayyid Haithem Bin Tariq Al Said at Muscat International Airport

Its nine islands features pristine white beaches and rare coral reefs, which are home to turtles, rare sea birds and dolphins.

Tomorrow Harry will also visit the historic Nizwa Fort, viewing local arts and crafts at a souq outside the gates before being greeted with a traditional sword dance inside the Fort's main courtyard.

He will also enjoy a guided tour around the historic ramparts of the Fort itself, which offer stunning views of Nizwa and the surrounding mountains.

Nizwa Fort was built in the 1650s by Imam Sultan Bin Saif Al Ya'rubi, although its underlying structure dates back to the 12th Century.

It is Oman's most visited national monument and a reminder of the city's significant role through some of the more turbulent periods in Oman's history.

On Thursday the prince will be taken to the stunning Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque in Muscat where he will be shown around by a member of the Diwan Higher Centre for Culture and Science.

The mosque was a gift to the nation by the Sultan to mark the 30th year of his reign and can accommodate a staggering 20,000 worshippers, including 750 women in a private musalla or prayer hall.

Formidable: Harry was met by an honour guard carrying traditional curved daggers

A Kensington Palace spokesman said: 'The Prince is travelling to Oman at the personal invitation of His. Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said. The visit reflects the close personal and respectful relationship that exists between The Royal Families of both countries.

'Despite The Sultan's unavailability to personally host Prince Harry on this occasion, both parties were keen that the visit still takes place given the direct and personal nature of the invitation.'

The aide added: 'It will be an opportunity for a Prince Harry to see and experience the country for the first time following recent successful and enjoyable visits by other members of his family.'

These include the Queen and Prince Philip in 2010 and Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall just last year.

On Thursday the prince will fly to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates where he will play in the Sentebale Polo Cup at Ghantoot Racing and Polo Club.

Afterwards Harry will attend a fundraising dinner and give a speech.

The match is in aid of the charity he set up in 2006 in memory of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, following a gap year visit to Lesotho. The name Sentebale means 'forget me not' in the local dialect, Basotho.

Tasty: Prince Harry was given coffee and a Middle Eastern sweet called halwa on arrival

Royal visit: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visited Muscat in 2010

Lesotho is a tiny, poverty-stricken and landlocked kingdom in Southern Africa with one of the highest HIV/AIDS rates in the world.

Sentebale supports the many thousands of children affected by the AIDS epidemic both directly and though losing their families to the disease.

Life expectancy for men and women in the kingdom is just 41 years, one in three children are orphans and there are believed to be more than 40,000 adolescents living with HIV.

The Sentebale Cup, which is in its fifth year, is helping to support the Mamohato Programme, which address the emotional and psychological needs of children living with HIV as well as working to reduce the stigma linked to the disease and helping to markedly improve their quality of life.

Harry, who plans to make a visit to some of the charity's projects in Lesotho next June, has said he hopes to expand its work to other countries in Africa.

It is understood that Harry plans to stay on in Abu Dhabi privately after the official elements of the trip have concluded on Thursday to watch the Formula 1 Grand Prix at the Yas Marina Circuit, which is on this weekend.
