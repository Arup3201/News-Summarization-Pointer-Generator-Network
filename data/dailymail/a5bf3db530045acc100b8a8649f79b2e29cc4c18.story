Gangster Darren Bowling who has been jailed after masterminding a £1million drug smuggling racket

A gangster nicknamed the 'Dodgy Don' has been jailed for 11-and-a-half years after masterminding a £1million international drug smuggling racket from a quiet Lancashire village.

Darren Bowling, 48, appeared to be a successful businessman who lived in a £500,000 former converted barn fitted with all mod cons in Barrowford, Lancashire.

He also owned a villa with a swimming pool in Marbella worth £1.2 million and drove a Lotus and a Porsche Cayenne with a personalised number plate.

But despite the wardrobe of Hugo Boss designer clothes and fancy holidays, police suspected he had never done an honest day's work.

Instead he used his storage company, car sales business and a share in a trendy wine bar as a front to import high purity cocaine and cannabis from Spain.

At Preston Crown Court, Bowling admitted conspiracy to supply a class A controlled drug, conspiracy to supply a class B controlled drug and money laundering.

He now faces having his 'significant property portfolio' across Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Cheshire and southern Spain seized under Proceeds of Crime laws.

Detectives acting on a tip off discovered Bowling had based his operations in the former textile village of Barrowford to peddle the imported drugs across the UK.

They began monitoring Bowling’s activities, which included him frequently heading to his properties in Spain to arrange for cocaine to be imported to the UK.

He would then meet up and talk with his co-conspirators to organise deals.

Officers eventually raided a number of properties connected with Bowling in January and seized more than two kilos of cocaine, 15 kilos of amphetamine, cannabis and £200,000 in cash.

Three other men were jailed for a total of 23 years whilst a fifth man fled to South Africa via Dubai and is still being hunted.

When police raided a number of properties connected with Bowling, they seized £200,000 in cash. Pictured is the £90,000 police found hidden at Bowling's Castle Packers warehouse in January 

In addition, police also seized £50,000 in cash from the back of his VW Golf as well as cocaine, cannabis and amphetamine

Today police said the break-up of the gang represented a ‘massive dent’ in the importation and selling of class A and B drugs in the UK.

Detective Inspector Martin Kane of Lancashire Police Serious and Organised Crime Unit who led the year-long investigation, said: 'In my experience of investigating organised crime, Darren Bowling was certainly one of those individuals that lived a fantastic luxury lifestyle from the proceeds of crime.

'From our investigation, we know that he owns property in Spain and Bulgaria and has a converted barn-style house and drove around in a Porsche. But we never saw him do a hard day’s work, despite him owning all these things.

Paul Bell, who worked with Bowling, was also jailed for his part in the drugs racket 

'There is no doubt Bowling has become a very wealthy man over the years from importing and supplying cocaine into the United Kingdom and Lancashire.

'Drugs like cocaine cause misery to communities. The amount of cocaine and the scale of the supply of it on the streets of Lancashire can never be underestimated.

'We are now continuing to investigate the properties and wealth Bowling has amassed over the years to support proceeds of crime proceedings later this year.'

One of Bowling's neighbours added: 'Everyone knew he was a drug dealer for years and you’d always see him out on town. His house is really smart and apparently he spent £40,000 on his kitchen with all the latest mod cons.

'He used to have loads of parties. He would go to bed and let people party on. He had a jacuzzi outside. He drove a black 4x4 Porche that had a private number plate with ‘BOW’.

'He always used to change his cars. He used to have designer clothes like Hugo Boss and he was always in and out of Marbella.

'He was nicknamed Dodgy Darren or the Dodgy Don. We’re just amazed he wasn’t caught sooner.'

The racket began after Bowling teamed up with Paul Bell, 49, who had just been freed from a 20 year prison sentence imposed for his involvement in another drugs plot.

Police mounted Operation Victor and watched Bowling as he cruised around in his Porsche.

Officers said Bowling worked with Bell and another man Michael Donnelly, to set up an underground drugs business.

Robert Wright, left, and Stephen Barton, right, were also jailed after both admitted conspiracy to supply drugs 

The investigation, which began in April 2013, looked into the importation and supply of cocaine, amphetamine, cannabis and money laundering across the North West.

The four were arrested in January after cross-county raids were carried out in Lancashire, Greater Manchester and southern Spain.

Bell, of Cheadle, Manchester, was jailed for 12 years and eight months after he admitted conspiracy to supply a class A controlled drug and conspiracy to supply a class B controlled drug.

Builder Stephen Barton, 42, of Blackburn, was found guilty of conspiracy to supply class B drugs and was jailed for four years and nine months.

During a police raid, they found cocaine and mixing agent within a yellow storage container at a yard on the M60 used by Robert Wright 

Robert Wright, 49, a self-employed landscaper, of Sale, Greater Manchester was jailed for five years and three months after he admitted conspiracy to supply a class A controlled drug and possession of cocaine with intent to supply.

Meanwhile Michael Donnelly, 42, previously of Barrowford is believed to have fled to South Africa via Dubai on a flight from Manchester on September 22, 2013.

He is currently being hunted and is believed to be in the run in Cape Town.

Robert Smith, senior crown prosecutor for the North West Complex Casework Unit said: 'This gang ran a well organised and extremely lucrative drugs supply operation throughout the North West of England.

Some of the cocaine seized from a drug deal by Wright, who admitted conspiracy to suplly a class A controlled drug and possession of cocaine with intent to supply 

'They were responsible for supplying significant quantities of cocaine and other controlled drugs and attempting to hide away from the authorities the large amounts of money they made from their criminal enterprise.

'I would like to reassure the public that the Crown Prosecution Service and police are dedicated to tackling drug and gang crime and will continue to target all those who wish to blight our communities with such criminality.'

In October 2013, Shaun McDonald, 37, of Manchester, a courier for Bell was jailed for three years and four months for possession drugs with intent and money laundering.

A seventh man, Mark Waring, 39 of Blackburn a courier for Donnelly, was jailed for seven years in December 2013 after pleading guilty to possession of class A drugs with intent to supply and producing cannabis.
