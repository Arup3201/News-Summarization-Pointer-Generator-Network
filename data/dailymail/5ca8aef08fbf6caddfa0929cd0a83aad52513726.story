Roberto Martinez is confident Everton have finally resolved the hamstring issue that has ruined James McCarthy’s season.

The Republic of Ireland midfielder had been Everton’s outstanding performer but he has spent much of the past two months on the sidelines.

He missed six games after being injured in a Europa League tie in Wolfsburg on November 27 but then returned for two matches against Stoke and Newcastle but was substituted in both.

Roberto Martinez is confident Everton have got to the bottom of James McCarthy's recent injury troubles

McCarthy has subsequently been ruled out of the defeat by Hull on New Year’s Day and the 1-1 draw with West Ham in the FA Cup and is unlikely to figure against Manchester City on Saturday.

Martinez, though, is satisfied that they have got to the bottom of the problem and he is predicting McCarthy will not be troubled by such injuries in the future.

Martinez said: ‘James is developing well. We need to make sure when he comes back he is 100 per cent ready for the second half of the season. It is making sure over the next three or four weeks we get everyone fit and ready.

‘We have got to the bottom of it and it will help him for the rest of his career. We have looked at his nutrition and how he recovers. He is a very peculiar profile of a midfielder as he is more of a sprinter. Midfielders are usually about stamina.

‘But James is a sprinter and those players need extra care. I think we have got to the bottom of it and now we have to make sure we manage it. I am sure when he will be back, he will be back for good.' 

Everton have not won since December 15 but manager Martinez is looking forward to taking on Man City

Everton have not won since December 15 but Martinez has no fear about facing Manchester City.

Martinez said: ‘We are looking forward to every game. We have strong characters and bravery. You see the players wanting to get on the ball and to be brave. Man City is the only game that matters, it is going to be a glamorous occasion and we want to show our best form.

‘A real determination of wanting to succeed. We defended well and we did not accept it was going to go away. That pleased me more than anything. The winning mentality is very strong and now we have to be at our very best to get something against City.’
