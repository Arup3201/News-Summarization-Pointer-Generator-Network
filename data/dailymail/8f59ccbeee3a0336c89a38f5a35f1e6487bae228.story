Fiddler: Ian Harrison's job at the Department of Work and Pensions was to investigate dole fiddlers and bring them to justice

Ian Harrison could never be accused of not wanting to take his work home with him.

His job at the Department of Work and Pensions was to make key decisions on benefit payouts and help root out fraudsters.

But the former policeman ended up in the dock himself for fraudulently claiming over £10,500 in disability benefits for a 'bad back' - the very swindle he was employed to prevent.

He claimed that a back injury suffered
 during his police career meant he could only walk 40 yards in three 
minutes and could not wash or shower properly.

However, colleagues in the DWP grew 
suspicious and mounted surveillance on him filming the 70-year-old 
walking his dog and going shopping.

He was soon arrested for fraudulently claiming £10,672 in Disability Living Allowance.

Huw Edwards, prosecuting for the DWP, 
told the court: 'In his job Harrison would look at people’s claims, he 
would take statements and give evidence in court against fraudsters.

'But, all that time he was claiming himself. The DWP started surveillance on him and had him covertly filmed.

'In addition to the video footage some
 twenty of his colleagues were asked about his condition at work and 
some said he had been moving around freely at work and did not need a 
stick.

'But none of them knew he was claiming
 Disabled Living Allowance at the higher rate and it was clear to them 
that he would not have been entitled to such benefits.'

The magistrates watched footage of 
Harrison walking with ease, pushing a shopping trolley and taking his 
dog on a lead on a trip to the Lake District.

Harrison pleaded guilty to failing to tell the DWP 
about a change in his circumstances - namely a change in his physical 
capabilities and that his mobility needs had decreased knowing that 
would have affected his entitlement to State benefits.

Allan Godwin, defending, said his 
client had suffered an injury while working as a policeman and had since
 suffered anxiety and depression.

The lawyer said: 'This is not all a 
figment of his imagination. He even had to have a specially designed 
desk at work to assist him.

'When he was working for the DWP he 
took time off work sick and his GP told him to get out and about more. 
He found his condition improved as a result. It is all a matter of 
degrees of improvement, but he does accept he should not have continued 
on the higher rate allowance.

'Over the time he got better when he thought he would get worse.

'He has put people in the dock and now he sits there himself thoroughly ashamed at getting his first conviction.'

Mr Godwin said that that Harrison - now retired - had paid back the money.

Sentencing Harrison to nine weeks 
imprisonment suspended for two years and an eight week curfew, chair of 
the magistrates Mrs Janet Boccaccio told him: 'In my seventeen years as a
 magistrate I have never come across a worse case than this.

'It was a gross breach of trust for a 
man in your work and it took place over a long period of time. You were 
within a whisker of going to jail.'

After leaving Lancashire Police Harrison joined the DWP anti fraud unit.

While investigating and exposing false claims on the State, married Harrison from Poulton-le-Fylde, near Blackpool, Lancashire, did exactly the same himself.

He started to claim benefits in 2006 magistrates in Blackpool heard.

But his role as an executive officer came under suspicion at the DWP national headquarters at Warbreck Hill, Blackpool.
