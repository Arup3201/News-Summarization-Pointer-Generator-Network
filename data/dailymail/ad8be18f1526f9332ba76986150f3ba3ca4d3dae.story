The shock of Paris Saint-Germain's 3-2 win against Barcelona on Tuesday is still reverberating around Europe, with the French and Spanish press continuing to react to the result.

In France, L'Equipe has reveled in the result - made all the more remarkable by the absence of captain Zlatan Ibrahimovic - and said the match ranks among the top 10 greatest victories ever for French clubs in Europe.

Others in the top 10 are Lyon's defeat of Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League in 2010, and Monaco's elimination of Los Blancos in the 2004 quarter-final.

Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo focused on Barcelona's failings, especially giving the ball away 54 times

Marca hailed Atletico Madrid's 1-0 win against Juventus, which got their Champions League campaign back on track

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo  focused more on Barcelona's failings, and particularly the Catalans' uncharacteristic wastefulness in possession.

Luis Enrique's men gave the ball away 54 times in total, resulting in them losing the control they ordinarily exert on a match.  

The Spanish clubs performed better in the Champions League on  Wednesday however, with wins for Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid.

Atletico got their European season properly started after losing their first match by beating Juventus 1-0 at the Calderon through an Ardu Turan goal. It was the first time the Italians had conceded all season.

Spanish and Italian newspapers both questioned Juventus's florescent green kit in their reports of the game. 

Atletico's city rivals Real also got a win as they laboured to a 2-1 victory away at Ludogorets. The Champions League holders fell behind early on but leveled through a Cristiano Ronaldo penalty and grabbed the three points when substitute Karim Benzema fired home with 13 minutes left.

The French striker had started the season slowly, with two goals from his first nine games, so the goal was a relief to him and his team. 

The Italian papers, as well as lamenting Juve's defeat in Madrid, also took a look at how its own players and managers got on for their respective clubs.

Corriere dello Sport went with the headline 'Liverpool and Mario Balotelli in crisis' following the Reds' 1-0 defeat by Basle, and summarised former Azzuri manager Cesare Prandelli's miserable night in charge of Galatasaray against Arsenal by saying 'Arsenal overwhelm Prandelli'.

La Gazetta dello Sport meanwhile hailed Italian forward Ciro Immobile's goal for Borussia Dortmund in the German club's 3-0 win against Anderlecht.
