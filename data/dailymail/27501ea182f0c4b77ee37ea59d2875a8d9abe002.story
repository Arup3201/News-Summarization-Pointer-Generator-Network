A Melbourne photographer has secured one of the most prestigious photography accolades in Australia, the National Photographic Portrait Prize from the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra.

Hoda Afshar, 31, was awarded $25,000 for Ali, an atmospheric and dreamy vision of a young boy wondering down a foggy pathway in a mountainous Middle Eastern village.

Ms Afshar beat 43 other finalists, selected from a record 2500 entries from across the country, in a unanimous verdict from the judges, who praised the dream-like quality of the work.

The Melbourne photographer returned to her native land of Iran eight years ago in the hope of documenting elusive walks of life. And that's exactly what happened when she stumbled upon a mysterious community living in the mountains.

'It exists above the clouds about three hours' drive up a mountain and you get to this heavenly, dreamy sort of village that I have to say is like a forgotten place, and there's no electricity, no technology, nothing – people have a different sort of lifestyle,' she told Sydney Morning Herald.

When she spotted the young boy wandering down the path, Ms Afshar captured the image on an old fashioned camera.

She told ABC that while she knew she had taken a great shot at the time, she had to wait to return to Australia to see the image in all its glory.

'It's a moment I think every photographer experiences,' she said. 'You know you have something special in there.'

Ms Afshar, who studied photography in Tehran before moving to Australia, plans to use the prize money to go abroad and show her works to a wider audience.

The judges praised the dream like quality of the work, deeming it to be deeply compelling. The panel also impressed by the runner-up, Barry and Alkirra, taken by Newcastle photographer Katherine Williams
