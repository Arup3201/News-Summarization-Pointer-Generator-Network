Sun-worshippers flocked outside in their droves today as temperatures across Britain soared to a balmy 18C (64F) – in what is a stark contrast to this day last year when inches of snow covered much of the United Kingdom.

The above average temperatures are a warm welcome for this time of year especially after last spring when the country experienced the coldest March for 50 years.

Today, temperatures reached 18.1C (64F) at Heathrow Airport and in Usk, South Wales. It was also a pleasant 17.6C (63F) in St James’s Park, London, and Pershore, Worcestershire.

It’s remarkably different from this time last year when blizzards left motorists stranded in 15ft snow drifts in Cumbria and temperatures plummeted in some parts of the country to -6C (21F).

Weather experts were forced to issue dozens of weather warnings across the country last March as snow, ice, heavy rain and high winds battered Britain.

Motorists spent the night in their vehicles in Sussex and Kent after the South East was hit by snow and, in Devon and Cornwall, heavy rain caused severe flooding prompting residents to evacuate their flood-hit homes.

However, 12 months on and Britain is continuing to enjoy the first mini-heatwave of the year – which was sparked by the hottest day of the year so far last weekend.

The highest temperature of the year so far was recorded as 20.5C (69F) in Gravesend, Kent, on Sunday and Met Office forecasters say the country could see similar temperatures this weekend.

Forecaster Tom Morgan said: ‘Temperatures in most places today are in the high teens. It’s very dry and there’s plenty of sunshine. It’s looking fairly fine tomorrow as well.’

He said temperatures could reach 19C in London and the South East on Sunday - well over double the March average of 9C (48F) - and said there would be a ‘good deal of sunshine’ across the country.

The unusually mild weather has caused bookmakers to slash the odds of the March temperature record of 25.6C (78F) being broken this year.

While the south of England is set to experience the best conditions this weekend, parts of Scotland may experience rain.

The unseasonably warm weather makes Britain hotter than parts of Europe and North Africa today - with temperatures in Algiers, North Africa, reaching only 16C (60F). Athens, Greece, is also reportedly colder than Britain today, with a recorded maximum temperature of just 15C (59C).

The weather was perfect for this year's Cheltenham Festival and spectators could be seen enjoying the sunshine at the four-day horse racing event which came to an end yesterday

Although the warm, dry weather is set to last for the remainder of the month, Met Office spokesman Dan Williams said Monday would be ‘fairly settled and dry’ but with more cloud cover and a maximum temperature of a cooler 16C (60F).

Conditions are set to become ‘more unsettled’ from Tuesday onwards though, he added.

Retailers have been taking advantage 
of the unseasonably warm weather. Asda said sales of shorts have jumped 
300 per cent in the past few days and even sales of swimwear have risen 
nine per cent.

Supermarkets
 said sales of burgers were up 121 per cent compared to this time last 
year, and sausage sales were up 38 per cent.

March 2013 was officially recorded as the coldest March for the last 50 years. On this day last year, motorists in Witham, Essex, pictured, were left stranded after deep floodwater hit the county

Meanwhile, the unusually warm conditions
 has meant that ripe English strawberries are in stock a week earlier than 
they were a year ago, prompting soft fruit sales at Waitrose to rise by 
12 per cent.

Garden plants 
sales are also up, and gardeners will have plenty of time to bed their 
new plants in as long sunny spells are forecast for most of Britain until 
Tuesday.

A Waitrose spokesman said: 'This 
weekend’s mild temperatures are reflected in our sales figures, with 
burgers up 121 per cent, sausage sales also up 38 per cent, and a 700 
per cent increase on our sales of garden plants compared to this time 
last year.'

Managers at 
Tesco said they were expecting a rush on sausages, ice cream and 
berries, while at Marks and Spencer they said ice cream sales had 
already doubled on this time last week.

Last year, residents in Crawley wrapped up warm and took to sledges to make the most of the snow which caused chaos across Britain and contributed to the coldest March on record for 50 years
