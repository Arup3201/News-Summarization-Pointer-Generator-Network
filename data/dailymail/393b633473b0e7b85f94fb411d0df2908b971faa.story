Daniel Chipchase, 20, has been given five life sentences for a string of child sex abuse crimes after the judge heard he showed 'sexualised behaviour' when he was just three

A man who began displaying 'sexualised behaviour' when he was just three years old has been jailed for life after admitting raping and abusing a string of young children.

Daniel Chipchase, 20, was ordered to serve a minimum of six years before he could be considered for parole after the judge at Lincoln Crown Court told him children were at 'significant risk of serious harm' from him doing the same again.

The court had heard that Chipchase had shown worrying signs of an unhealthy interest in sex from the age of three and four, when he drew indecent pictures and tried to assault other young children.

It also emerged that Chipchase had escaped custody for raping a 10-year-old girl several years ago before going on to rape and sexually abuse three more young children.

Chipchase, who was taken into care when he was five, was first referred to social services as a potential sex offender in February 1997, at the age of three, because of his 'sexualised' behaviour, the court was told.

The following year, when Daniel had started school, a teacher reported him for sexually touching another boy in class, Chipchase's barrister said.

Alexander Dunn said: 'Perhaps the most important mitigation is the background.  He has himself been subjected to serious sexual abuse and he has also witnessed abuse and violence perpetrated against his mother.

'It is clear that Mr Chipchase's formative years have had a profound and lasting effect on him. He is an extremely damaged individual. He was displaying sexualised behaviour from an extremely young age.

'He has also witnessed abuse 
and violence perpetrated against his mother.'

Mr Dunn added: 'In July 1997, at four, there was concern about sexualised behaviour as a result of drawings he made of genitals', and he said he used explicit language.

The lawyer said that in December 1997, when Chipchase was still only four, he was reported for trying to perform a sex act on another young boy.

'In 1998 a teacher noted an incident at school where Daniel had his hand on another boy's groin', he said.

In the same year Daniel was also seen trying to indecently assault a young girl.

Mr Dunn said that Chipchase appeared to regard such incidents as normal behaviour and added 'In some ways Mr Chipchase has never had a chance.'

He told the court that Chipchase was 
taken into care two days after his fifth birthday. He initially stayed 
with foster parents, but after his first conviction for rape he lived at
a specialised children's home where attempts were made to deal with his
sexualised behaviour.

Mr Dunn quoted a probation report 
which stated: 'It is clear that Mr Chipchase’s formative years have had a
profound and lasting effect on his well being.'

He added: 'He is sorry for what he has
done. It is clear from the psychiatrist’s report that what he needs is 
one-to-one counselling and help. That can be given to him in prison.'

Mark Van der Zwart, prosecuting, said
that Chipchase was convicted in 2007 aged just 13 when he was given a 
three-year supervision order after pleading guilty at Mold Crown Court 
to raping a 10 year old girl.

In October last year he was arrested 
again after raping a six-year-old boy in a public toilet on a caravan site at 
Mablethorpe, Lincolnshire.

Police were alerted by a holidaymaker who was shocked by what he overheard while using an adjoining cubicle.

Later further charges were brought 
after two young girls came forward in his native North Wales to report 
they had been sexually abused by Chipchase. One of the girls told how 
she had been raped aged five while the other girl was subject to a 
series of sex attacks starting when she was six.

Chipchase admitted raping and assaulting the six-year-old boy, and a string of rape and sexual assault charges involving two girls when they were aged between four and eight.

Lincoln Crown Court: Chipchase was given five life sentences after admitting a catalogue of sex abuse

Judge Sean Morris gave Chipchase five concurrent life sentences and placed him on the sex offenders' register for life.

Passing sentence at Lincoln Crown Court, he told Chipchase 'You have pleaded guilty to a catalogue of sex crimes...

'You represent a significant risk of serious harm to children from further such offending. I am of the view that if you were to be alone with any young child, male or female, your sexual urges would get the better of you and you would commit serious sexual offences against them.

'This is a case where there are multiple victims and multiple rapes. Life is the only sentence that will provide lasting and enduring protection for the public.'

Det Sgt Alison Smith of Lincolnshire Police said 'Daniel Chipchase is a predatory danger to children.'

'His future detention, supervision and monitoring will be of paramount importance.  It is frightening to think what might have happened to other children had his reign of terror and abuse carried on unchecked.'
