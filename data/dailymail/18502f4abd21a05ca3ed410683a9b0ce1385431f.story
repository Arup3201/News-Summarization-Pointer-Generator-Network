A tireless single mom got the shock of a lifetime last week when a kindhearted stranger paid for her family's dinner at Pizza Hut and left a three-page note applauding her 'loving' parenting.Â 

The mom, who asked not to be named, had taken her three kids - two of whom have special needs - to the pizza chain in Durham, North Carolina, last Friday when she saw a young man sitting alone in a nearby booth and went up to him to apologize for the noise her kids would no doubt make.

He told her not to worry, and that he had three little ones of his own so could relate.

Kind: A tireless single mom got the shock of a lifetime last week when a kindhearted stranger paid for her family's dinner at Pizza Hut and left a three-page note, pictured, applauding her 'loving' parenting

According to ABC11, the mom went back to her table, thinking nothing more of it as she worked hard to engage her four-year-old daughter whom she recently learned has bullying tendencies, and her six-year-old son who has Asperger's and ADHD, keeping them on their best behavior through-out the meal.

After the man finished up his pizza and left, a waitress came over to the family and told her the young man had paid the family's bill and left them with a Pizza Hut gift card.

The waitress also said he'd asked for some paper and a pen soon after the family sat down and then handed the mom the three-page letter he'd written.

With tears streaming down her face, the mother and the waitress, who was at this point also sobbing, read the note together: 'I do not know your back story, but I have had the privilege of watching you parent your children for the past 30 minutes,' the note read.

'I have to say thank you for parenting your children in such a loving manner.

'I have watched you teach your children about the importance of respect, education, proper manners, communication, self control, and kindness all while being very patient. I will never cross your path again but am positive that you and your children have amazing futures.

'Keep up the good work and when it starts to get tough do not forget that others may be watching and will need the encouragement of seeing a good family being raised. God bless! -- Jake'

Thankful: 'You just don't know what people go through,' the mom told ABC11. 'Here I've had the worst few years of my life and I never get recognition like this... I want him and his family to know that he's awesome

So moved by the gesture, the mom wrote to ABC11 to share the heart-warming story. She explained that the past few years had been very trying for her family, with a messy divorce, constantly moving house and her college student had to take a year off from school.

She said she was also the victim of domestic violence, which is why she didn't want to be identified.

'You just don't know what people go through,' she told ABC11. 'Here I've had the worst few years of my life and I never get recognition like this, I just do what I can to get by.

'I want him and his family to know that he's awesome. You never know who's watching you.'
