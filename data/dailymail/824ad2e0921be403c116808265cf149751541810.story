Freddy Adu, who made his professional debut aged 14, is again without a club having been released by Serbian side FK Jagodina.

The American hit the headlines in 2004 after signing for Major League Soccer's DC United but 10 years on, Adu has failed to live up to his star billing.

The 25-year-old forward was a member of the USA's 2008 Olympics team but was let go by Jagodina having failed to make an appearance during a six-month stint with the club.

Despite struggling for regular first-team action, it seems Adu is still able to enjoy the footballer's lifestyle if the former USA forward's Instagram account is anything to go by.

Adu, who trained with Blackpool in February, regularly poses with a bevy of blondes and recently shared an image of his brand new diamond watch.

Once labelled as 'the next Pele' during the early stages of his career, the Ghanian-born forward has played just 59 minutes of competitive football since the end of the 2012 MLS season.

In 2006 he moved to Real Salt Lake, before Portuguese giants Benfica signed him a year later. He dabbled in Ligue 1 after failing to hold down a first-team spot in Lisbon, joining Monaco on loan for the 2008-09 season.

The next season he was back in Portugal with Belenenses, before he moved to Greek side Aris in January 2010.

Thirteen months after that he joined Turkey's Caykur Rizespor, but that spell was short-lived and he returned to the US half a year later.

Adu finally appeared to be settled after spending two years at MLS side Philadelphia Union, only to suddenly join Bahia in April 2013.

He was released by Bahia in November and had trials with Blackpool in February and in June former US boss Bob Bradley offered him a chance at Norwegian side Stabaek.

Adu failed to impress Bradley enough to secure a long-term deal, which led to a trial with Eredivisie side AZ Alkmaar before his move to Serbia.
