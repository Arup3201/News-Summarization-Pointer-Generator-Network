A second grand jury has indicted a North Carolina police officer who killed an unarmed former Florida A&M football player by shooting him ten times last year.

Charlotte officer Randall Kerrick, 28, was indicted for voluntary manslaughter Monday in the shooting of 24-year-old Jonathan Ferrell last year. A separate jury declined to indict Kerrick last week.

Investigators say Kerrick shot Ferrell on September 14 as he looked for help after a car crash. The voluntary manslaughter charge carries a prison sentence of up to 11 years.

Georgia Ferrell, the victim's mother, told CNN that she is willing to be patient as the case travels through the justice system. 'I just feel like God's will will be done,' she said.

Charles Monnett, an attorney for the 
Ferrell family, said: 'With the strength of the evidence in this case, 
we're not surprised.

'We're
 all pleased and happy that the process is beginning now and that 
there's an end in sight. It is the first step towards justice,' Monnett continued.

The panel handed down the decision hours after a judge ruled the Attorney General's office could resubmit the case after the first grand jury declined to indict Kerrick.

Because
 the panel was four members short, Attorney General Roy Cooper decided 
to make a request to send the case to a second jury.

Kerrick's attorneys said that there was 'nothing irregular or improper' about the first grand jury.

Ferrell’s
 family claim that he was in a submissive position – either on his knees
 or lying on the ground – when he was shot, and filed a wrongful death 
suit against Kerrick two weeks ago.

An
 attorney for the family said the were 'disappointed, shocked, 
devastated' by the first decision not to indict Kerrick, as reported by WBTV.

Fatal: Ferrell apparently walked about a half-mile to the nearest house at the upscale Bradfield Farm community and was 'banging on the door viciously' to attract attention.

Ferrell had survived a car accident and banged on the door of a nearby house in the middle of the night looking for help.

Last Tuesday the grand jury decided not to indict Officer Kerrick on the charge and asked the prosecutor to submit a lesser charge.

But
 the state Attorney General's office issued a statement later in the day 
saying it would resubmit the case to a full grand jury after learning 
that the panel that heard the case was less than a full panel.

NBC News
 reported that the Mecklenburg County grand jurors submitted a 
handwritten note saying that there wasn't enough evidence to indict 
Kerrick on the original charge.

Kerrick's attorney, George Laughrun, said the officer felt like 'the weight of the world has been lifted from his shoulders.'

'He's extremely relieved that the 
grand jury members saw fit to keep an open mind and not listen to all 
the propaganda on all the things he did wrong,' Laughrun continued, as 
reported by the Charlotte Observer.

Chris
 Chestnut, the family's attorney, told the newspaper that the first 
grand jury's decision was 'highly suspicious and gravely concerning.'

The attorney said that the Ferrell family have been left out of the process throughout the investigation.

'There has been nothing to demonstrate that this case has gotten the attention it deserves and needs for the citizens of Charlotte and America,' Chestnut said.

'It's that important a case. This feels like they don't value Jonathan's life.'

Charlotte NAACP President Kojo Natambu told WBTV: 'This is one of the most despicable decisions I have ever seen made by human beings.'

The wrongful death lawsuit filed by the Ferrell family also alleged that despite him
 lying mortally wounded on the ground officers still deemed it necessary
 to handcuff him, according to NBC News.

The deadly encounter unfolded in Charlotte at about 2.30 a.m. on Saturday September 14 after Mr Ferrell had apparently been in an automobile wreck. A crash so severe he would have had to climb out of the back window to escape.

Ferrell apparently walked about a 
half-mile to the nearest house at the upscale Bradfield Farm community 
and was 'banging on the door viciously' to attract attention.

Thinking
 it was her husband coming home late from work, the woman who lived 
there opened the door. When she saw Ferrell, she shut it and called 
police. The authorities subsequently released a tape of her 911 call.

A
 sobbing woman can be heard pleading for police to ‘please hurry’ after 
telling a dispatcher that a man was breaking into her front door.

‘He’s still there yelling,’ the woman said as the 911 dispatcher told her officers were on their way. ‘He’s yelling. He’s yelling.’

The unidentified woman keeps repeating ‘Oh, my god! Oh, my god!’ throughout the call.

She also told the 911 operator that she had a baby in a crib and didn't know what to do. ‘He’s in his bed. I don’t know what to do. I can’t believe I opened the door,’ she said.

Later, she said the man was knocking on her door and ‘he's in my front yard yelling.’

When three officers arrived they claim that Ferrell ran towards them. One officer attempted to Taser Ferrell but that didn't work and investigators said Ferrell continued to run towards Officer Randall Kerrick who had his service weapon drawn.

Officer Kerrick fired 12 shots at Ferrell, striking Ferrell ten times. CMPD said officers on the scene thought Ferrell was a threat, but Kerrick was the only one who drew his gun and fired.

Ferrell's family said the former 
Florida A&M University football player moved to Charlotte about a 
year ago to be with his fiancee and was working two jobs.

He wanted to go back to school and eventually become an automotive engineer.

Ferrell's mother said Kerrick had no business being a police officer if he couldn't react properly to a man who needed help.

'I truly forgive him. I pray for him. And I pray that he gets off the police force,' Georgia Ferrell said.

His family painted a picture of a bright man with an 'infectious smile' who was always there for his brothers and sisters.

'He was a role model,' said his brother, Frank. 'He had so much love in his heart. And he was always concerned about his family.'

'He had dreams of being an automotive engineer. He wanted to design a car from the very last bolt to the interior,' his brother said.

He said he didn't know where his brother was going that night, or why he got into the accident. But he said his brother had never been in trouble before.
