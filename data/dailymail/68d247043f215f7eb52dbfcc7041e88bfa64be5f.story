In 2006, Marcus Lee was offered a job in Dubai, working for one of the country's largest property developers. He and his wife Julie, both accountants from Sydney, decided to take a chance on the offer and made the move to the United Arab Emirates.

Three years after they moved, Marcus was arrested for a crime he didn't commit and spent nine months in Dubai prisons, including two months in solitary confinement, and four years under house arrest as he fought to clear his name.

Marcus, 45, and Julie, 50, whose ordeal finally came to an end in January when they were able to return to Australia, have written a book about the experience.

The book, Trapped, consists largely of Marcus's diary entries from the time of his imprisonment. In the book he tells how the process of writing about his ordeal and the love notes smuggled to him by Julie on her prison visits were his 'lifeline'.

Marcus and Julie Lee went through a five year legal ordeal, which resulted in Marcus being imprisoned for nine months

After the couple relocated to Dubai, Marcus says 'Everything was going along happily for a few years' before he was hauled into a police station and questioned about a man he had never met and a payment his company had made to another company.

Marcus was able to fire off a text message to his wife, who had returned to Australia for her mother's 80th birthday, telling her to get back to the United Arab Emirates as it looked like the situation was serious.

Marcus would spend the next nine months in some of Dubai's most notorious prisons. For six months of this time, Marcus had not been charged with anything. Eventually, Marcus was charged with bribery and attempting to defraud his company Nakheel and Australia's Sunland Group, crimes for which he was eventually acquitted.

After receiving his panicked text message, it took Julie two weeks to find out where her husband had been taken.

'Julie got access to me after about two weeks; she had to first locate me. [When she finally found me] we were allowed five minutes in this meeting room, we couldn't really say anything… It was just a state of utter confusion,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'You go to work, you do your job, you're suddenly arrested, and there are these wild accusations. We're both pretty boring accountants thrust into horrific circumstance. We're not elite, we're not high-flyers, we're not connected, we're just accountants,' he said.

Marcus spent the first two months in solitary confinement, in a cell 1.5 metres by 2.5 metres in size, located in the national security headquarters with the 'terrorists and threats to state'.

He was allowed to leave his cell to go to the bathroom, as well as for three phone calls a week and a twenty-minute weekly visit from Julie.

After two months, Marcus, who by this point had become very ill as a result of the 'rancid food', stress and 'cold, musty, dirty' conditions, was moved to a police station with 200 other prisoners where he was kept for another two months, before being moved to the central prison in Port Rashid, where he spent the five months before he was finally granted bail.

Marcus contracted pneumonia while in Port Rashid, which he thinks may have killed him if Julie had not been able to visit and slip him antibiotics tablets. During the time he was imprisoned and under house arrest, Marcus's father, step-father and grandmother died and he was not able to fly home for the funerals,  which he said was a trauma that 'rippled through the whole family'.

Marcus and Julie were allowed to return to the country in January this year

'The visits and phone calls were the only times, other than using the bathroom, that I was allowed out of my cell. It was so claustrophobic in that tiny space, the walls seemed to get closer the longer I was in there. From time to time I would hear screaming echoing down the corridor. I never knew if it was the anguish of people who were being driven mad by solitary confinement or if they were being beaten or tortured.

'I am guessing that being a white westerner conveyed some level of protection other prisoners like the Indian or Pakistani ones didn't have. The Australian consulate would have raised an outcry if they saw me with bruises. I was never beaten or directly physically threatened, although many guards acted in a menacing, intimidating way. One of their favourite tricks was to bang on cell doors in the middle of the night, making wild accusations or threats.

'They would say things like, 'You've been telling your wife lies about us beating you, haven't you? You've been telling the consulate lies, haven't you? Do you want to be sent to Central Prison with the rapists and murderers? That's what will happen to you.'

'I was so vulnerable by this point that the threat of being thrown to the wolves in prison was completely terrifying, even worse than solitary. I suppose it's a version of the Stockholm syndrome that makes kidnap victims not want to leave their captors.

'They would also threaten to cut off the phone calls and the weekly visits. That sent stabs of fear through me: Julie was my lifeline. One particularly nasty guard had a favourite taunt: I had better tell them everything I knew, he said, because if I stayed in here my wife would leave me. I worried about how Julie was coping but I knew she would stand by me. I told the guard he obviously knew Julie better than me, but the sarcasm went straight over his head.'

This is an edited extract from Trapped by Marcus and Julie Lee, published by ABC Books

While in prison Marcus began writing as a form of therapy.

'There's no trauma counselling over there. A friend said "Just start writing your thoughts down". One page became, five became 10, 10 became 50.'

The journal, which forms the basis for the book written by Marcus and Julie, was smuggled out of the prison by Julie on her visits.

Marcus was allowed to write while in jail and was allowed to pass notes to his wife, but he knew that if one of his notes, which detailed the horrors he witnessed in the jail - including violence, rape, and terrible conditions - was intercepted he and Julie could be in a lot of trouble from authorities.

Julie began slipping messages to Marcus, writing messages, poems and love letters inside books that she was sometimes allowed to give him.

'On the rare occasion she could get a book in, she'd put a poem in the middle of the book, something to keep me going and remind me that there's something there.'

Marcus was eventually released on bail, on the condition he, Julie and an Emirati sponsor, sacrifice their passports and that they pay $300,000.

Marcus was kept under house arrest for four-and-a-half years until he was acquitted. Prosecutors appealed the acquittal, but in November 2013 the acquittal was upheld.

'It was a massive relief, but it didn't end there. We'd accumulated so much debt, I couldn't work, and we had to fight to get our bail bond back so we could pay back our debts.'

It was not until the plane took off from Dubai Airport for Sydney in January this year that Marcus and Julie really felt their ordeal was over.

They returned to the country asset-less, as they were forced to sell their family home in Sydney because they couldn't afford to keep up the repayments and Marcus has not returned to work, saying people treat him with an 'element of suspicion', despite his acquittal, because of his arrest.

For Marcus, writing the book is a way of telling his side of the story, which gained considerable publicity in Australia.

'When someone's arrested overseas, there's this immediate thought of Schappelle Corby, it's not always the case… You're trapped in the Middle East, you're a long way from everyone, a lot of wild speculation and spin, you're in a jail, and you can't counter it in any way.'

Another purpose for the book is to shine a light on the 'literally thousands' of other prisoners trapped in Dubai prisons who are waiting to be tried, or even charged.

'They're the forgotten ones… They typically come from poorer countries – India, Bangladesh, Pakistan. A lot of them are trapped there, there's a name for them in Arabic, kully wully, the literal translation is "doesn't matter", they're trapped in a never-ending cycle.'

Marcus feels incredibly lucky he had Julie and his legal team to fight so hard to free him and the couple have moved to the Gold Coast where they are settling back into normal life, with their 14-year-old dog Dudley.

'I pinch myself every day when I realise I don't have to go to court, don't have the threat of incarceration.'
