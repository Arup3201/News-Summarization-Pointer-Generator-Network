For many people with primary school children, their weekends are filled with football and cooking, laughter and games.

However, for some families, time away from school is filled with violence and the constant dread of being attacked - by their own children.

While incidents of domestic abuse against women by their partners is well known, violence against mothers by their children is still a relatively taboo subject.

Ten-year-old Robert kicks his mother Tracy at their home in Preston, Lancashire

One woman, Tracy, lives in perpetual fear of her ten-year-old son Robert and his vicious onslaughts which range from kicks to punches.

Indeed, she says sometimes his attacks are so violent, she's had to call the police to come and save her.

'I've got locks on my bedroom door - at the top and the bottom - so I've got somewhere safe to run away from Robert,' says Tracy, who lives in Preston.

'Sometimes it's just a clip around the head, other times it's a punch or a kick.'

In the past two years, Tracy has had to call the police on numerous occasions to intervene. 

'Once the police used riot gear to go up the stairs after him,' Tracy said.

'He used to throw a paddy when he was two and people used to say to me, "don't worry, he's going through the terrible twos, he'll grow out of it" but it didn't stop, it just got worse, and it hurts a lot more now.'

Robert sits in his bedroom and contemplates his behaviour having spoken to Ann Ramsden from the Rosalie Ryrie Foundation.

Robert can be seen attacking his mother on the Channel 5 show My Violent Child.

Tracy says her son was diagnosed with Attention  Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) at the age of five and he's now on the strongest dose possible.

'Robert can be full of life, full of energy, very loving and very caring,' adds Tracy.

'But the other side he can be violent and primarily nasty. I've had to put locks on my door so if Robert is getting violent I have somewhere safe to go.

'It's terrible having to have somewhere in the house that's safe for me - this is my home, I should feel safe all the time.

Tracy anxiously peers through the window wondering what mood her son will be in when he returns home

'He kicks, hits and throws things at the wall. When he's in a temper, he's got so much force behind him.

'I'm scared that one day he's really going to hurt me, and if it isn't me, it's someone else and then he will get into trouble for it.'

Robert's stepfather, Steve, said he's concerned about the escalating levels of violence.

'He can be evil at times and chased Tracy out of the house with two bread knives and we had to call the police.

Eight-year-old Bailey hates getting ready for school in the morning, lashing out at his mum Sarah 

Sarah says she has tried everything to stop Bailey attacking her and disrupting family life

'He's grabbing a knife more and more often. Is he going to use it or is it just a threat? We don't know.'

Elsewhere, Sarah and Chris are struggling to cope with the behaviour of their son, eight-year-old Bailey, on school days.

The eldest of three children, Bailey shouts and hits his mother and younger siblings, Kenzie, four, and toddler Millie.

'Sometimes he kicks me and punches me if I switch the television off or tell him to eat his breakfast or sit still,' said Sarah, who lives in Burnely. 'He punched me in the nose this morning and most mornings I don't think I will get him out of the door to school.'

Bailey, who has also been diagnosed with ADHD, now does kick boxing, which Sarah hopes will help him learn to control himself.

'I've tried everything,' said Sarah.

'I've taken time off work to go on a course about ADHD, I've tried different strategies. My kids are everything to me.'

On the show, viewers will see behaviour specialists Lorrine Marer and  also Ann Ramsden from the Rosalie Ryrie Foundation work with Bailey and Robert respectively, teaching the families different techniques and looking at the causes of each boy's actions.

My Violent Child will be shown on Channel 5 this Wednesday at 9pm.
