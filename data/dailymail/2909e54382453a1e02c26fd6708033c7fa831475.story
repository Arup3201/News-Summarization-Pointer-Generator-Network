A mother wept as she laid flowers at the spot where her 12-year-old daughter was run down and killed by a van whilst walking over a zebra crossing, less than a year after the council axed its lollipop ladies.

Annalise Holt was on her way to a pre-Christmas playdate with a school friend aged 11 after classes on Tuesday when she was hit by the Mercedes Vito vehicle.

Eyewitnesses told police she was trapped under the van after being dragged along the road. Both girls were rushed to hospital for treatment to serious injuries, but Annalise died five hours later.

The younger girl suffered severe bruising in the accident and remains in hospital.

Yesterday Annalise's mother Lesley Holt, 31, and her family laid flowers and looked at tributes to the youngster at the scene of the crash which occurred at 4.30pm on Tuesday during the evening rush hour.

She said: 
'Annalise was my beautiful angel princess. She was full of joy and 
energy, loud and outgoing. She was a kind 12-year-old girl, always 
willing to help others, old and young.

'She
 is the light of my life, my whole world. I love her more than words can
 say. She was everything to me. She was too young to be taken away. She 
was going to have a great life but it's not to be.

'I just want her back and everyone to remember her for the loud, helpful, kind, caring child she was.'

The road in the town of Shaw, near 
Oldham, Greater Manchester is a well-known accident black spot after an 
elderly woman died and her husband was severely injured as they crossed 
the same pedestrian crossing.

Up
 until earlier this year the crossing used to be patrolled by lollipop 
ladies and men but Oldham council axed the service in spending cuts, saying schools would have to meet the costs themselves.

The council has denied that the lack of a crossing patrol was a factor claiming there would have been no-one on duty when the accident happened shortly before 4.30pm because they would have finished at 4pm.

A spokesman for the council said in a statement: 'It is true that this crossing used to have a patrol for two local primary schools, but at the time of day when this incident happened the patrol would not, in any case, have still been on duty given that they finish at around 4pm.' 

Annalise's headmaster Dr Kevin O'Hagan at Royton and Crompton comprehensive said: 'Everyone was saddened to hear of the untimely and unfortunate death of one of our pupils in a road accident.

'Annalise was a very intelligent student who was making excellent progress in line with achieving the highest grades. She was a model student who set an example for others in all aspects of school life.

'She will be sadly missed by all staff and pupils at the school. Our thoughts and condolences are with Annalise's family and friends at this time.'

Locals have previously called for a 
pelican crossing with traffic lights to be erected at the site. The two 
girls were hit by the Mercedes Vito as they stepped out onto the 
crossing, opposite the Weaver's Answer pub.

Iltaf
 Hussain, owner of nearby Taff's newsagents said: 'The little girl was 
between the bonnet and the wheels. I said can we pick the van up and get
 the girl out but one guy said we shouldn't touch her until the 
ambulance arrived.

'The
 other girl was lying in the middle of the road. Two or three people 
were sitting and talking to her. It was a horrible scene - I feel for 
those poor families. How are they going to celebrate Christmas now.'

Friends of Annalise arrive with a bunch of flowers. A pensioner was killed at the same crossing earlier this year

He added: 'The crossing is very very 
dangerous. There have been 33 or 35 incidents there. They took away the 
lollipop lady this year. I didn't see what happened but the Vito van hit
 one of the girls and took her forward ten yards.

'It
 is very very sad. One week before Christmas and about this time last 
year it was the same thing happening with the elderly couple. They need 
to put up proper lights and signs. It is very sad.'

Local
 Liberal Democrat Councillor Mark Alcock said: 'it's absolutely 
terrible. This time of year to lose somebody so young and for another 
one to be injured is just awful.

'We
 have been campaigning as councillors for years to get this crossing 
fixed. After the last death less than two years ago all they did was 
repaint the white lines. It needs sorting now. This is another young 
life we have lost.'

Rev
 Lynne Connolly vicar of St James Parish Church said: 'Something needs 
to be done about the safety of the crossing. It need to be reviewed, 
maybe lights need to be put up.

'We said prayers last night and this morning for the two girls and we will continue to pray for them.'

Greater Manchester Police are appealing for witnesses.

Sgt
 Paul Higgins said: 'A young girl has tragically been killed and we are 
working hard to find out the circumstances of the collision.

'Our thoughts are with her family and we are supporting them at this difficult time.

'We would ask anyone who saw the collision to get in touch with us as soon as possible.

'In particular, a car that was behind the blue Mercedes Vito van left the scene before police arrived. We are very keen to speak to the driver and any passengers in that vehicle as they may have information that could help us with our investigation.'

Labour Councillor Dave Hibbert, Cabinet Member for Environment and Housing, at Oldham Council said: 'This is a particularly tragic incident that has cost a schoolgirl her life and shocked the local community. Our sincere condolences go out to her family and friends at this terrible time.

'Our thoughts and concerns are also with the youngster who was injured in this incident and we all hope that she will make a full recovery.

'We are working closely with the police to investigate this incident and as such we would like to ask any witnesses to come forward.

'It would be inappropriate to comment further without establishing the facts.'
