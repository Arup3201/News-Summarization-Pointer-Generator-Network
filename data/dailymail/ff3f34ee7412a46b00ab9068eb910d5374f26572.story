Visitors to this British beauty spot could be forgiven for thinking something has gone wrong with the seasons.

For amid the typical autumn colours of yellow, brown and orange are these swathes of distinctly summery bright blue hydrangea blooms.

The late warm spell means they, and some darker blue varieties, have stayed in flower well beyond the time when they normally start turning brown.

The blooms are a feature of hydrangea valley at Trebah Garden near Falmouth, Cornwall, where temperatures were still in the sixties – 60.8F (16C) – at the weekend.

Vistors to Trebah were fooled into thinking it was the height of summer rather than mid-October as Hydrangea Valley is still in full bloom as warm weather continues

Blooming: Hydrangea Valley basked in 16C today as the rest of the country descends into a winter chill. The forecast shows cloud for tomorrow but sunny spells later

The mop-head hydrangeas, which are native to Japan, owe their vibrant Oxford and Cambridge blue colour to Trebah’s rich acid soil.

And the blooms may last a bit longer yet – forecasters say today will be brighter and drier in many parts of the country.

Meanwhile, blustery weather sweeping in across the UK has led to stunning images of giant wind turbines that have been likened to a work of art.

The turbines off the coast of the holiday resort of Clacton, Essex, stand at 129 metres, even dwarfing a large tanker in the surrounding North Sea.

And with the blades in full effect from recent 40mph gusts of wind there will be plenty of power for the 125,000 homes they supply.

Photos of the blades taken from a head-on angle led to eye-catching images.

The turbines are part of the Gunfleet Sands Wind Farm, run by Danish firm DONG CORR Energy. The company has just installed two more giant turbines which stand at a whopping 148 metres.

Hydrangeas, which are native to Japan, owe their vibrant Oxford and Cambridge blue colour to Trebah's rich acid soil and may stay so during dry spells later
