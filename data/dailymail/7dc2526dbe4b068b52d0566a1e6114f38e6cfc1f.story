Muscling though crowds in a packed pub to queue up and order drinks at the bar can take the edge off a good night out.

But a new app allows you to skip the tedium of trying to attract the attention of bar staff and instead place an order on your phone.

Orderella allows customers at certain pubs to order and pay for their food and drinks at the touch of a button.

German researchers last year shared some tips on how to get served fastest at a bar.

They said that busy bar staff choose customers to serve if they are standing facing the bar or are directly in front of them, instead of whether they have cash at the ready or are snapping their fingers.

The scientists' study of body language is being used to develop a bartending robot that will be able to spot who really wants a drink and serve them in the fairest order.

Researchers from the Bielefeld University found nine out of 10 thirsty customers adopted the subtle approach of deliberately facing the bar, which is the most successful for getting noticed and served, according to the study.

By contrast, only one in 15 customers looked at their wallets to signal that they would like to place an order while fewer than one in 25 customers gestured at the bartender.

The study looked at recordings of customers at nightclubs in Edinburgh and Germany to analyse how their body language attracted the bar staff’s attention.

When their order is ready, it can be brought to their table or customers receive a message when they can collect it without any hassle.

Payments can be made through the app, so there is also no need to wait around for the bill either.

The app is currently being trialled by four pubs in Brighton, East Sussex, with the aim of rolling out to 37 InnBrighton pubs in the near future.

Gavin George, chief executive of InnBrighton, said: ‘Orderella is very appealing to the sociable, cultured, tech-savvy customers who enjoy InnBrighton pubs.

‘When 
you’re in deep conversation or soaking up the sun in a beautiful beer 
garden, it’s great to have the choice to order from your table and have 
your drinks brought to you.

‘We look forward to it becoming a key tool in our customer service kit.’

The app was the brainchild of five business executives with backgrounds in IT, finance, consultancy and law.

Dennis Collet, chief executive of Orderella, said: ‘We’re thrilled to be so widely available across Brighton.

‘It’s a town where people socialise, making Orderella the ideal app, as they can forget the queue and make the most of the beer garden weather.’

The app is available to download for free from the iPhone App Store and Google Play Store.
