Brighton may not have won for six games and are in desperate need for their strikers to start scoring, but Joe Bennett insists they can cause a shock at White Hart Lane.

The left-back, on loan from Aston Villa, got the goal to earn his team a draw against Rotherham in their last Championship game and believes a victory is close.

Bennett backs under-pressure manager Sami Hyypia and believes a good performance against Tottenham in the Capital One Cup can provide a catalyst.

‘I don’t see why we can’t go there and get a result,’ said Bennett. ‘It will be a tough game, you never know what team Spurs might put out.

‘People are saying we need to concentrate on the league but if we can get back to winning ways it will boost confidence and be a positive going into the weekend against Bournemouth. They’re on fire at the minute.’

Brighton are languishing 21st in the Championship table, having made the play-offs the last two years, with five draws and a defeat in their last six.

Bennett was the fourth defender to score this season, with Lewis Dunk on four league goals, Gordon Greer on two and Bruno with one.

Craig Mackail-Smith is the only striker to find the net in the Championship, once, while Sam Baldock and Chris O’Grady are yet to score.

‘In training they’ve been really good, they are all good finishers,’ said Bennett. ‘It’s up to the team as well, we need to create more chances for the lads to finish. It will come, I’m sure we’ll get moving up that table.

‘We’ve been playing some good football actually, I think we’re nearly there. The only thing that’s missing at the minute is goals. It’s about being clinical in the final third.

‘All the players are behind the manager. We’ve been drawing a lot. I came to Brighton to help the team get promoted and I think we’ve got a good chance, come the end of the season we’ll be there at the top of the table.’

Bennett took the bold decision to move away from Villa in the summer to ensure games and has impressed, offering an attacking outlet and defensive security.

He has one year left on his contract and would like the opportunity to re-establish himself under Paul Lambert once this season is over.

‘I’m focused on doing well for Brighton first,’ he said. ‘Over the last year or so I’ve improved and matured as a player, both mentally and physically.’
