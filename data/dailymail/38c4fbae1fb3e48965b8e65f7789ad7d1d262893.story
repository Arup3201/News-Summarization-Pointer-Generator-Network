A four-year-old girl grabbed her purple raincoat, slipped out of her house alone and hopped on a Philadelphia bus in search of a snack.

The only problem was, it was 3am. 

Bus driver, Harlan Jenifer, says the girl swung her legs in a seat as she chanted: 'All I want is a slushie!'

Authorities say the girl's family didn't know she had awoken and unlocked the backdoor to start her trek during a downpour early Friday.  

'All I want is a slushie!': Little Annabelle decided to go on a little adventure in Philadelphia on Friday morning

All aboard: She woke up, put on her raincoat, unlocked the backdoor and headed out in the rain for the bus stop four blocks away. The only problem was it was 3am, and she was alone

Thanks: As Annabelle hopped on the bus, helped by another passenger, the driver was understandably shocked and asked what she was doing and where her parents were. She said she was going to get a slushi

Independent: The confident Annabelle hopped aboard the bus all by herself at 3am Friday

Comfortable: Dressed up in her raincoat, Annabelle initially took a seat near the front

Wandering: Annabelle wandered around the bus for a while also, as the driver questioned what to do with her

Good times: Annabelle is seen in security footage from the bus swinging her legs and chanting: 'All I want is a slushie'

They found nothing amiss at the house and have no plans to file charges.

The bus driver is a father-of-three. 

He says he was scared for the girl but found her adventure funny. 

He says he knew she was in good hands.

He stopped the bus and called police. 

They took the girl to a hospital, where she was reunited with her mortified mother, who only realized Annabelle was missing when the hospital called.

Her father, Timothy Ridgeway, told 6 ABC that he keeps thinking how differently the situation could have turned out and how lucky his family is. 

My mind is wanting to go places, it's hard not to,' Ridgeway told the network.  

Mortified: Mom Jaclyn Ridgeway did not know her daughter had left the house until she received a call from the hospital saying they had Annabelle and that she was fine

Worried: Father Timothy Ridgeway says she keeps questioning what might have happened to Annabelle 

Ridgeway added: 'Thank God for the bus driver.' 

Annabelle's mother, Jaclyn, was just as grateful, and became emotional during the interview.  

'There are no words, (the bus driver) saved my daughter's life,' she told 6 ABC.

'I'll be forever grateful.'

The couple say they have reconfigured the locks on all their doors. 

Safe and sound: Annabelle was reunited with her parents, but never actually got her slushie
