Holidaymakers got more than they bargained for when on safari at a South African game reserve.

The tourists were given an uncensored view of wild animals in their natural habitat.

In dramatic footage taken by staff at the Londolozi ecotourism reserve, on the western border of Kruger National Park, tourists can be seen in a jeep watching a fierce stand-off between hyenas and lions over a buffalo carcass.

The pride of lions had been eating a buffalo carcass when a few hungry hyenas came to demand a share. 

Shortly after the big cats were located by the trackers, more hyenas arrived and the aggressive confrontation kicked off.

In the sometimes distressing footage, a tourist can be heard saying: 'I can't watch.' 

The larger big cats eventually scare the persistent cackle away and the lions were left to devour the remains of the buffalo.

The animals were tracked by Londolozi tracker Judas Ngomane and ranger Don Heyneke during a morning game drive.

The whole sighting lasted for around 45 minutes.

Rose Hipwood, founder of The Luxury Safari Company, which arranges trips to Londolozi, said holidaymakers 'dream' of seeing some good 'predator action' whilst on safari.

She added: 'The combination of Londolozi's unrivalled location, abundant wildlife and exceptional guides means that the game viewing here is second to none.

'An experience such as this, which the guide has positioned the guests perfectly for is truly once in a lifetime. These two giants of the African predators battle it out often, but never with such force of numbers or such drama.'
