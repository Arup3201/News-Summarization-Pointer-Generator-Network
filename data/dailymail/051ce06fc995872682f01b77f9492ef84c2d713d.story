For years they said Elmbridge was the closest place to paradise in the UK.

That exclusive corner of Surrey – dubbed ‘the Beverly Hills of Britain’ – offered everything from long life expectancy to low crime rates. Residents even enjoyed more sunshine.

But it seems there is now somewhere even brighter – and it’s sitting midway between the built up cities of Birmingham and Coventry.

Sitting between Birmingham and Coventry, Solihull has been named as the best place to live in the UK

Unlikely as it may seem to many in the South East, Solihull – the home to Land Rover’s main production plant – is now ‘officially the best place to live’.

With a population of just over 200,000 residents, known as ‘Silhillians’, the town is commonly thought to be named after the position of the church of St Alphege – on a ‘soily hill’.

It may not sound as glamorous as the Elmbridge towns of Claygate and Oxshott, but the bottom line is Silhillians enjoy everything from better pay to faster broadband than millions of other Brits.

Among its local heroes are Good Life actress Felicity Kendal, who was born in Olton, a suburb of the borough.

BBC newsreader Michael Buerk, former England rugby captain Martin Johnson and Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond were also all born in Solihull.

And Apprentice star and newly-appointed Government small business champion Karren Brady lives with her family in the nearby village of Knowle.

A standards of living report by price comparison website Uswitch.com examined every aspect of life in different parts of Britain – from the amount of sunshine to life expectancy, average earnings and crime rates.

While Scotland dominated the bottom of the league table, Solihull – where many people commute the ten miles to Birmingham city centre – came out on top.

The Uswitch report said: ‘People in Solihull pay high house prices, high energy bills and hefty council tax bills.

‘But these costs are outstripped by high average salaries, relatively high levels of disposable income, low mortality rates, high life expectancy and above average broadband speeds.'

The average Silhillian household has a disposable income of £17,359 per head. By comparison, those of both East and North Ayrshire, ranked the ‘worst’ places to live, have a disposable income of £14,430 a year.

The average weekly rent paid by a Silhillian is only £69, while a six-bedroom home can be bought for the price of a small flat in many parts of the South East.

Life expectancy in the town is calculated as 81 for men and 84 for women.

The annual car insurance paid by residents is £528 a year, which is cheaper than anywhere else.

In 1840, a description of Solihull by the anonymous author of Sketch of Solihull said: ‘[Solihull] is remarkably neat and rural in its appearance and justly excites the admiration of travellers.

‘Though the houses of the poor are inter-mingled with those of their richer neighbours, yet no painful disparity offends the eye or impels the beholder to invidious comparisons.

‘An air of comfort and respectability marks all alike and renders Solihull indisputably a delightful looking town.’ 

Solihull was the birthplace of BBC newsreader Michael Buerk, former England rugby captain Martin Johnson and Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond

Solihull is one of the most prosperous towns in the Midlands. Almost 70 per cent of the borough is designated as green belt and it enjoys superior communication links with the M40, M42 and M6 all close by.

The town was the subject of The Country Diary of an Edwardian Lady by Edith Holden, an artist and naturalist who lived in Olton.

Written in 1906, it was forgotten until it became an international bestseller when published in 1977, 57 years after her death.

While the Uswitch report showed that residents of West London are the richest in the country, typically getting a post-tax income of £32,823 each, it is also the most dangerous place with the highest crime rate.

Michael Ossei, a personal finance expert at Uswitch.com, said: ‘This is hard evidence of  the different challenges faced  by people depending on where they live.’
