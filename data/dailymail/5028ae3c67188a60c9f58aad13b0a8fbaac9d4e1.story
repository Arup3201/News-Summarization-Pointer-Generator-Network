This is the heart-stopping moment a driver narrowly avoided a head-on collision with a car travelling in the wrong direction on a dual carriageway.

Police have confirmed a 73-year-old man, from Burgess Hill in West Sussex, drove the silver BMW in the wrong direction for almost eight miles - but it appears no one was hurt.

The pensioner is now being assessed by health workers and the DVLA have been informed about the incident.

Sussex Police have confirmed the pensioner got on the dual carriageway shortly before 10am this morning after going in the wrong direction down a slip road at Hickstead.

A Sussex Police spokesman said: 'He then drove  along lane three of the northbound carriageway. 

'Vehicles heading north had to take evasive action to avoid him.

'We are investigating a report that a silver van collided with a telegraph pole as the driver swerved to avoid the BMW. There are no reports of any injuries.'

Road policing unit officers intercepted the BMW on the A23 to the north of the Mill Road roundabout in Brighton.

The spokesman added the driver stopped his car after seeing the marked police car travelling towards him slowly at the head of the traffic.

The driver was then taken by ambulance to be assessed by health workers.

Paul Germaine, 60, the managing director of a security firm, was travelling to work  when his dashboard camera filmed his narrow escape at around 10.13am this morning.

He said: 'I drive a powerful car but I am so glad I was only doing the regulation 70 miles per hour at the time - it could have been nasty.

'At first I thought there had been an accident and the car was stationary and pointing in the wrong direction.

'But then I realised it was actually pottering along at around 30 or 40mph. Luckily, there was a space between the two vans I was overtaking and I managed to slide between the two.

'I immediately called 999 from the handsfree and the operator said they had already had several calls and had dispatched cars who were trying to catch up with him.' 

Concerned motorists took to social media to talk about the incident - Sussex Police said they received a number of calls

Sergeant Mark Baker from Sussex Police said: 'We are very grateful to all of the drivers and members of the public who stopped and called us to warn us about the man's driving and for their attentive driving that enabled them to avoid a collision.

'We were able to react quickly and thankfully no one was injured.

'The man is now being medically assessed and we will be making the DVLA aware of the incident.'
