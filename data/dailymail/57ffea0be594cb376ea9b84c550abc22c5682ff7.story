A mother who set up a website for her murdered daughter ended up being stalked by an internet crank who travelled half way around the world to declare his love, a court heard.

Karen Downes, 48, started the site in memory of her 14-year-old daughter Charlene, who vanished ten years ago after being groomed by a child-sex gang.

But the court heard it led to her striking up a friendship with New Zealander Mark Bailey.

He then became so besotted that he saved up enough cash to travel to Britain, before demanding that Mrs Downes leave her husband and family to ‘be with me and  nobody else’.

When she refused, he attacked her and pulled her hair during a confrontation earlier this month.

Bailey, 27, was given a six-month restraining order and fined £75, plus a £20 victims surcharge, at Blackpool Magistrates’ Court.

Last night, Mrs Downes spoke of how the incident had left her terrified. ‘He wanted to see me but got me trapped in an alleyway,’ she said. ‘I became frightened and started to scream. He could have had a knife or anything and he was threatening me. He had shown an interest in my website – the Charlene case – and it snowballed from there.

‘When he told me he was coming over here I thought it would  not happen.

‘I was surprised when he arrived but he wanted me to leave my family and control me, but that was never going to happen.’

Mrs Downes’s daughter disappeared in Blackpool in November 2003. Police believe her body was put in a mincing machine and made into kebabs and burgers sold from a takeaway in the town.

Although two business partners were later tried for her murder, they were acquitted and no-one has ever been held responsible.

After setting up the site dedicated to her daughter and the investigation, Mrs Downes chatted to Bailey online for 12 months, Neil Cheesbrough, prosecuting, told the court.The New Zealander then arrived  at the seaside resort seven months ago. He claimed he and Mrs Downes were lovers, but she denied they were having a sexual relationship.

The court was told that Mrs Downes ended their ‘affair’ earlier this month and police warned Bailey not to harass her.

But two days later, the pair met in Cookson Street in the town. When they started arguing, he  grabbed her hair, which was tied in a bun.

Gary McAnulty, defending, said his client believed he was in a genuine relationship with Mrs Downes and had moved from New Zealand to allow it to flourish.

The lawyer added: ‘It was slightly bizarre because Mrs Downes is married and lives with her husband. After being warned by police he arranged to meet her to discuss matters and said he loved her.

‘I have had to explain to him she wants nothing more to do with him. It is a sad end.’

Police believe Charlene fell victim to child-sex gangs, centred on  takeaway restaurants in Blackpool, at the age of 12. They claim she  was sexually abused by as many as 100 men in the run-up to her death.

In 2007, Iyad Albattikhi and Mohammed Reveshi were tried for murdering Charlene but a jury failed to reach a verdict and a retrial collapsed. They later received six-figure compensation sums for false imprisonment.
