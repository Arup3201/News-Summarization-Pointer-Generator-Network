Time may be running out for Andrew Culliford. But ask him whether he'd rather meekly give in to the illness that's killing him or risk taking an unlicensed drug that might stave off its devastating effects, and his answer is unequivocal: he'd take the drug - without a second's hesitation.

The 37-year-old fire officer and father-of-one was diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND) in July 2011 at the age of just 34. He was told he had just two to five years to live.

There is no cure for the disease, which affects the motor neurons - nerve cells that control muscles - in the brain and spinal cord. The muscles gradually waste away, affecting the patient's ability to walk, talk, eat, drink, swallow and eventually breathe.

Within a year of his diagnosis, Andrew started losing the strength in his right arm and hand. His speech became slurred, and in 2012 he and Donna married while he could still say his vows.

'Now I have to feed Andrew because the muscles in his tongue and throat have weakened,' says Donna. 'His speech is very slurred so I often have to interpret what he says to other people. He can't use his arms and is starting to find walking more difficult.'

The only treatment for MND on the NHS is riluzole, which offers just three extra months of life after it's been taken for a year.

But there are other drugs that might help. Through his own research, in late 2012 Andrew came across aimspro, which was being tested for neurological conditions such as MND and multiple sclerosis. Former Rugby Union player Joost van der Westhuizen was taking it for his MND after travelling the world looking for a cure.

'We figured he'd be getting the best treatment for the disease, so Andrew wanted to try it,' says Donna.

New drugs undergo three stages of testing. In the first, the drug is given in small doses to healthy patients to check for side-effects; then it's given to a larger group of people who have the disease it's been developed for; finally, some patients are given larger doses, while others are unknowingly given a placebo.

Aimspro has undergone an 'open label' clinical trial, a version of this last stage, where patients know they are taking the real drug, not a placebo.

But it could still take ten years for it to be licensed and prescribed to patients - time that desperately ill patients such as Andrew do not have. What they want is access to drugs such as aimspro before they are licensed.

However, drug companies are reluctant to allow this, even to dying sufferers, for fear of being sued if patients experience adverse effects or die as a result of taking them.

Aimspro is available for 'named patient compassionate use', meaning a doctor can prescribe the drug where no other is available, although it is still considered experimental and has to be paid for privately.

Furthermore, the doctor bears the risk of being sued, so many are reluctant to do this.

Andrew was able to find a doctor who would prescribe the drug, but had to sign a disclaimer to waive his rights to sue if something went wrong. He's since spent all his savings and money raised by well-wishers - a total of £50,000 - having the £180-a-day drug injected.

'I was able to carry on working, albeit in a more administrative role, at the fire station. I even ran the London Marathon this year,' says Andrew, speaking through Donna.

But the drug could only slow progression of the disease, and by summer he couldn't use his arms, meaning everyday things such as making a cup of tea were out of reach. 'But he still believed the drugs were helping,' says Donna who lives with Andrew and their four-year-old daughter Isla in Poole, Dorset.

However, his money has now run out and he's had to come off the drug - and in the three months since he stopped taking it, he has gone considerably downhill.

'The muscles in my throat and tongue that help me speak have deteriorated,' says Andrew. 'My speech was slightly slurred before, but now it's worse.

'Walking isn't coming naturally any more - I have to concentrate on how to do it.

'We were recently at a wishing well and Isla threw a coin in and wished I had new arms.

'I'd love to pick Isla up and cuddle her - it's what I long for.

'It's been soul-destroying knowing there's a drug out there that would help me, but I can't have it.'

Now it seems that a new law could soon make Andrew's wish a reality.

Yesterday it was announced that a Bill which would allow terminally-ill patients to be given untested drugs had received government backing.

The Medical Innovation Bill, which will go before the House of Lords on Friday and is due to be considered by MPs in December, would allow doctors to treat people with terminal illnesses - and who have exhausted standard treatment options - with drugs that are unlicensed or have not been tested for their disease.

The Bill would give legal protection to doctors so long as they obtained agreement from another specialist to prescribe drugs or surgery which wouldn't normally be given for a patient's condition.

This would apply to NHS and private doctors, meaning that funding would come down to local health authorities, now known as Clinical Commissioning Groups, as is the case with standard treatment. If passed, the Bill could become law in England and Wales by March.

The Bill was proposed by the Conservative peer Lord Saatchi, who has led a campaign to change the law after his wife, author Josephine Hart, died from ovarian cancer, aged 69, in 2011. He argued that current rules are impeding medical progress, forcing doctors to stick to traditional treatments which don't always work.

'Doctors know if they divert from these well-worn treatment paths and attempt an innovative treatment, and then something goes wrong, they will be found guilty of medical negligence,' he has said. As he told Good Health yesterday: 'I want every patient who is facing a terminal diagnosis to be able to ask their doctor: 'Have you tried everything?' And for this Bill to allow doctors to say, confidently: 'Yes.'

'No patient should die thinking more could have been be done, but wasn't for fear of the law. No husband, wife, son, daughter, mother or father should be forced to say goodbye to a loved one with that doubt hanging over them.'

Donna Culliford says she and her husband, who have spoken previously in the Mail about the need for the law to change, 'support this Bill 110 per cent'.

'Doing nothing is not an option for us. Sitting here waiting for the Grim Reaper is not an option. We know aimspro works for Andrew, so that's the drug we want to try.'

Another patient who could benefit 'hugely' from the proposed legislation is six-year-old Jack Johnson.

He has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a terminal and incurable condition that causes muscles to weaken, and he is slowly losing the ability to walk and lift things.

His mother says there are 43 drugs in development for Jack's condition, but none has yet been approved. 'Jack will die from Duchenne, but he could have treatment,' adds Alex, 30, who lives with her husband Andy, 40, their two-year-old son James and Jack, near Chorley, Lancashire. 'This new Bill would change all that.

'I'm not some crazy parent. We want to discuss these untested drugs with doctors and make a decision together. We'd be willing to sign a waiver if they would just give us access to these drugs.

'As a mum, I see these promising drugs dangling in front of me and we can't use them. Jack has said to me: 'Mummy, when are my legs going to get better?' All I can do is tell him Mummy and Daddy are working hard to find new treatments.'

'I would try these drugs on Jack. I know that might kill him. But the risk, for me, is doing nothing. My son is going to die anyway.'

Yet some clinicians don't think the Bill is the way forward. Michael Baum, professor emeritus of surgery at University College London, said yesterday: 'Changing the law is not going to accelerate innovation in cancer therapy, but might, endanger our patients by uncontrolled experimentation.'

And Ammar Al-Chalabi, professor of neurology and complex disease genetics at King's College London, has warned: 'Licensed drugs have to go through rigorous trials. Even if an unlicensed drug works in some way, it might kill you in another way or cause problems.'

But many patients don't accept this argument. In August the World Health Organisation said people with Ebola should be allowed untested drugs; Andrew believes the same should apply to other people facing death. 'I know we can't compare having MND to the Ebola outbreak, but for those of us with a terminal illness, we're facing a crisis every day.

'I'd welcome being used as a guinea pig for untested drugs. It might make a difference to others and it would give me a sense of purpose, rather than just fading away.'
