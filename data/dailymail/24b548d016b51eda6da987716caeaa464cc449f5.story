Few managers can appreciate the loss of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge to Liverpool better than Burnley manager Sean Dyche.

While the two Liverpool strikers were tearing up the Premier League with 52 goals between them last season, Sam Vokes and Danny Ings were firing Burnley to promotion from the Championship with a combined total of 40 League goals.

Vokes has not played this season due to a serious knee injury, though the Wales international could finally return to the squad to face Liverpool at Turf Moor.

Ings was also missing for more than a month with a hamstring problem, and Dyche can fully understand why Brendan Rodgers’ side have suffered without their two main strikers.

‘With all due respect, Vokes and Ings are still learning to be Suarez and Sturridge-type players,’ said Dyche.

‘So if we’re missing them, it’s fair to say that Brendan Rodgers will miss two players like that from his side.

‘Liverpool without Suarez and Sturridge look a different unit. Still a good unit, but are they as good? The question remains.

‘Strikers make a difference. That’s why they all drive massive cars, that’s why there is a shortage of them, that’s why the world demands “Can we find a striker?” — because it changes the whole view of the team.

‘Rarely did your dad speak to you about the right back. I remember mine talking to me about Ian Rush and other Liverpool strikers. They make a massive difference to the way a team looks.’
