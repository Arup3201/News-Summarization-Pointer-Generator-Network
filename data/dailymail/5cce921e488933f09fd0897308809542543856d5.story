High-speed cameras have revealed how cats can manage to land safely even when falling from a great height.

Cats have long been renowned for their ability to land on their feet, and now a new documentary will show exactly how the pets manage to hold onto their nine lives as they twist and turn on their way to the ground.

Images filmed on a high-speed camera show how a cat's body will perform four manoeuvres in mid-air, including stretching out their legs to transform their bodies into a living parachute.

As part of new ITV documentary The Secret Life of Cats, the animals were filmed in a studio as they were dropped from a height of around 10ft

Slowed down, the footage shows how a 
cat will first straighten up so its body will eventually be parallel to 
the ground, turning on its head and then its tail.

It will then spread all four limbs to slow its fall and as it nears the ground, the cat will extend its claws to give it a good grip when it lands.

Finally the tumbling animal will flex its back to minimise any shock from landing.

Sir Patrick Bateson, emeritus professor of ethology at Cambridge University and president
 of the Zoological Society of London, said that a cat's legs give the 
animal air resistance which enables its body to spin around faster.

'They
 stick out their legs so that provides greater inertia, so that when 
they turn the body the bits that are sticking out don’t turn so 
rapidly,' he told the Sunday Telegraph.

'Then they repeat that with the other set of legs.'

Instinct: By the time a kitten is seven weeks old it will have already developed the instinct needed to survive a fall, known as the 'righting reflex'

According
 to the documentary, which airs tomorrow night, by the time a kitten is 
seven weeks old it will have already developed the instinct needed to 
survive a fall, known as the 'righting reflex'.

Sir Patrick said that one of his cats, Nelly, had fallen behind a wardrobe when she was a kitten, breaking her pelvis because the space behind the cupboard was too small for her to fully turn.

'She is fine now, but it was a clear demonstration of how if you prevent the animal turning and sticking its legs out, it cannot do the whole operation,' he said.

In 2012 it was reported that a one-year-old cat called Sugar had fallen 200ft from a nineteen storey window in Boston, USA, with just a bruised chest.

And a 1987 study of 132 cats taken to a vet in New York after falling from high-rise buildings revealed that 90 percent of them survived and one 37 percent required emergency treatment to save their lives.

One animal which fell 32 storeys survived with a chipped tooth and a collapsed lung, and was allowed to go home after just 48 hours.

Using new filming techniques to show cats as many of their owners will never have seen them before, the documentary also reveals remarkable stories including how one cat saved a couple from a gas explosion and the surprising relationship between a blind Labrador and the feline friend who acts as his guide.

One cat who features in the show is Basil, who turned up on Sue Roff’s doorstep unexpectedly 16 years ago.

Basil’s acute sense of smell prevented a potentially fatal accident for Sue and her husband one night in 2011.

'I’d done dinner, my husband had gone up to bed. I’d cleaned the cooker and then went up to bed,' said Mrs Roff.

However, she had accidentally left one of the gas rings on and asleep upstairs, neither she nor her husband could smell the leaking gas.

The pilot light on Sue’s central heating was due to switch on soon, and that would ignite the gas.

But as cats have a sense of smell 30 times better than that of a human, to Basil the smell of gas was intense and dangerous.

'At about 1.30am he came on the bed, patted my face and I pushed him away,' said Mrs Roff.

'An hour and a half later he came back, he was much more insistent. He came back and patted my face with one little claw. Then I knew there was something wrong.

I could smell something unpleasant; it literally filled the whole house. He could have literally just walked out the cat flap outside, but he didn’t. If he hadn’t have woken me up, it would have just gone kaboom. I’m really proud of him, he is my hero.'

The programme also tells the surprising story of the relationship between a blind dog, 14-year-old Labrador Terfel, and his best friend, a cat called Pwditat.

Terfel had been thrown against a wall as a puppy, causing his blindness, but Pwditat has been able to act as his guide cat.

'Terfel is much more confident when Pwditat is around,' said owner Ann Cragg.

'He relies on him to avoid bumping into things. Often when they’re out, they’re nose to tail. Pwditat in the lead and Terfel following him.'

Secret Life of Cats will be broadcast on ITV at 9pm on Monday June 2.
