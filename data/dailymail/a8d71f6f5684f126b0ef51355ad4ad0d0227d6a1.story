Are double Ds about to go the way of the dodo? That's what Jockey International is hoping, now that the company has introduced JOCKEY Bra, based on a brand new sizing system focused on breast volume rather than the rigid cup and band measurement system currently used in the industry.

Instead of the typical A, B, C, D, etc, cup, Jockey's Volumetric Fit System measures the volume and shape of a woman's breast plus an under-bust measurement, with the volumetric sizes running from 1 through to 10. The new system has 55 size combinations, and promises to address the long-bemoaned problem of ill-fitting bras.

Cup sizes currently are based on two measurements - the breast at its fullest point, minus the rib cage measurement. If it’s a one-inch difference, it’s an A cup; a two-inch difference, a B cup, and so on. Jockey International says this equation doesn’t account for volume and different breast shapes.

Good fit: Jockey's new Volumetric Fit System comes with 10 plastic cups, a measuring tape and instructions on how to find your perfect bra size

Bra sizes also vary widely from one manufacturer to the next, and from country 
to country, and women's bodies and breasts often don't conform to the 
arbitrary sizes offered by companies. These are the problems Jockey is seeking to solve.

'It took us eight years to develop the new Jockey bra and its revolutionary Volumetric Fit System,' said Sally Tomkins, Jockey's senior vice president of design, research and development.

'Through our research, and countless hours of testing and talking with women, we are confident we are answering women's desire for the perfect-fitting bra.'

Patented: The Double Lined Contour Bra (left) and the Classic Contour Bra are two of the options in Jockey's new JOCKEY Bra range and have a patented 3-D contour design that does away with underwires

Soft support: The Classic Soft Cup Bra (left) and the Double Lined Soft Cup Bra have 'unique 3-D Inner Sling Support for a revolutionary soft cup' that has no underwire and great support

The Volumetric Fit System can be ordered from Jockey.com for $19.95 which can be redeemed as a $19.95 discount off the price of a bra. It comes in a small mesh bag and contains 10 plastic molded cups in different sizes, a measuring tape and a booklet of instructions and bra styles.

Women using the system should select a cup that looks closest to their size and place it over their breast. The cup that fits is the one with the best coverage, with no gaps or 'spillage'

Cups runneth over: Jockey's new bra fitting system lets women measure themselves to find their perfect fit using 10 different-sized plastic cups - if there are gaps, it's too big, if there is spillage, it's too small

Next, use the color-coded measuring tape to take a direct measurement of the under-bust area. There are seven different band sizes (30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 or 42).

Price point: Like the entire JOCKEY Bra range, the Tailored Contour Bra retails for $60

The new measuring system would result in sizes such as 1-30, 7-36 and 9-42.

Jockey
says that in contrast with the 80-year-old alphanumeric measuring 
system which is a pure mathematical equation, the new system takes into
account the volume of a woman's breast rather than just her 
measurements.

Bra shopping is notoriously 
traumatic, with research showing 75 per cent of women have trouble 
finding a bra that fits properly and a staggering 85 per cent are 
wearing the wrong sized bra.

'Women
also dislike the bra shopping experience due to the overwhelming number
of bra choices, lack of attentive service, and complexity and variance 
of proper sizing,' says the Jockey website.

According to research on Jockey's website, 53 per cent of women have never been professionally fitted for a bra.

The JOCKEY Bras themselves come in five 
different styles so far: Classic Contour, Tailored Contour, Double-Lined
Contour, Classic-Soft Cup and Double-Lined Soft Cup and they each come 
in black, white and nude colors. Jockey has also pledged not to 
discontinue any of its bra styles.

The JOCKEY Bras come with a patented '3-D Contour support' replacing the underwire, which 'supports, cups and shapes the breast without any poking, giving women an exceptionally comfortable fit'.

Mission impossible: Many women dread bra shopping due to the 'overwhelming number of bra choices, lack of attentive service, and complexity and variance of proper sizing', according to Jockey International

Bra cup sizes as we know them were invented in 1932, and band sizes became popular in the 1940s. The sizes have barely changed since then, though the range has expanded along with the general population's weight.

The originator of the bra was Parisienne Madaleine Gabeau, who received a U.S. patent on 21 November 1911 for a bra with soft cups and a metal band supporting and separating the breasts.

With a price tag of $60, it remains to be seen whether or not the JOCKEY Bra and sizing system will catch on, but new adopters can rest assured that the company has a money-back satisfaction guarantee on its new bras.
