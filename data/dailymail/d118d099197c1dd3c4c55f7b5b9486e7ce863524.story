Ryan LaFlare faces one of the toughest challenges of his unbeaten career as he takes on perhaps the most decorated Brazilian jiu jitsu practitioner ever to grace the Octagon in Demian Maia.

Maia proved against welterweight title challenger Rory MacDonald last year that once he takes control from the top, there is no way out.

But while New Yorker La Flare acknowledges the tough test that lies ahead, he believes he will hold the advantage in the striking and wrestling departments.

Ryan LaFlare will be hoping to make it 12 from 12 when he takes on Demian Maia at UFC Fight Night 62

'The guy is one of the top guys in the world, you know, of course he's good,' he told Sportsmail.

'I'm just a little better. I think that his striking is maybe a little more basic for me. 

'I think I have a little bit more of an awkward, outside of the box approach to it and I think that that's something I can use. A lot of his wrestling is pretty basic and I've been wrestling my whole life, so that's another thing I can use.' 

Having been out of action for nearly a year after being struck down with a bone infection last August, Maia is reporting a clean bill of health ahead of the contest and the submission specialist is looking to impress his countrymen in Rio. 

'I am very proud to be here in Brazil again,' he said. 'I'm very happy with the opportunity the UFC has given me, to fight a main event here in Rio de Janeiro, a city I love - especially returning from an injury. I am 100 per cent now, I feel much stronger than I felt in my past camps.'

And when it comes to LaFlare's 11-0 record, which includes four consecutive wins under the UFC banner, Maia knows that he will have to be on top form to put the first blemish on the American's clean record.

'I will need to want to win the fight a lot more than he wants to,' he added. 'Because I know he has a lot of will power, but I need to have more than him.'

 Despite other fighters citing their reluctance to face off against a Brazilian opponent on their home turf, LaFlare believes that the crowd will offer Maia no advantage once the Octagon door shuts. 

'I don't think it makes any difference to me. Once the Octagon doors are shut, it's just me and him in the cage,' he said. 

'Some people could think differently but, for me, it's just me and him – just another day in the office.' 

The Brazilian Fight Night's co-main event packs a huge punch as well, as spectacular striker Erik Silva faces off against polarizing UFC veteran Josh Koscheck. Stepping in as a late replacement for Ben Saunders, this is a must-win situation for 'Kos' who is currently on four-fight losing streak in the UFC.
