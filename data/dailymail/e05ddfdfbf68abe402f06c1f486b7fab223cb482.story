French armed officers have revealed that they cut down the jihadi gunman who killed four hostages at a Paris supermarket in a hail of over 40 bullets.

The special forces team said they worked 50 straight hours before they launched their assault on Friday, fatigue diminished by the thought of avenging their colleague Ahmed Merabet.

He was killed in cold blood two days earlier during an attack by brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.

Eye-witness footage of the execution caused revulsion around the world.

French armed officers have revealed that they cut down the jihadi gunman who killed four hostages at a Paris supermarket in a hail of over 40 bullets

Amedy Coulibaly killed four at a Paris deli on Friday and was killed by police commandos in a hail of bullets

‘Sincerely, one of the things that most motivated us was that video of the odious assassination of our colleague Ahmed Merabet outside Charlie. We all had that image in our heads,’ Jean-Pierre, one of the members of the Raid police team that brought the deli siege to an end, told Le Parisien, according to the Daily Telegraph.

He said that the stand-off between the police and the Kouachi brothers at a warehouse in Dammartin-en-Goele acted like a shot of adrenalin, despite having been on duty for over two days.

He added: ‘When that attack begun, we were suddenly not tired anymore.’

Another member of the assault team, named as Stan, revealed that they had snipers training their sights on the supermarket, in the Porte de Vincennes area of the city, but couldn’t get a clean shot because there were advertising posters in the windows.

A third member of the team, named as Marc by the French newspaper, told how deli gunman Amedy Coulibaly was met with a wall of bullets when he charged at them.

The team placed explosives at the entrance to blast their way in, as Coulibaly had placed shopping trolleys across it.

But in the end the fanatic attacked them first. He fired his Kalachnikov at the police team, retreated back in to the supermarket, then came at them again.

Police had wanted to take him alive, but it was clear that this was a suicide mission for Coulibaly.

Marc said: ‘In front of us we had a man, ultra precise, well trained, who knew how to work his AK47. Then he threw himself at us.’

He described the counter-attack by the police as being ‘like a bomb going off’.

The description of the siege by members of the special forces team came as pictures emerged of shoppers hiding in a freezer during the stand-off.

Final words: Hostages quietly huddled around cardboard boxes, some texting goodbye messages to family they feared they would never see again. One of the trapped hostages even managed to joke: 'We’ll open a bottle of wine. Here, there are plenty'

Freedom: Some of those pictured inside the freezer later walked to safety outside the supermarket, escorted by armed French police

Coulibaly had killed four people as he entered the supermarket.

Hearing shots, shoppers at the back of the store fled downstairs to the storeroom where they huddled together in temperatures of -3C (27F). Fearing they would not escape alive, they made what they believed would be their last calls to family to tell them they loved them.

One man, known only as Ilan, was with his young son and quickly removed his jacket and wrapped him in it as they cowered in freezer for nearly five hours.

The pictures from inside the storeroom were made public as the hostages came forward to give dramatic accounts of their ordeal on Friday. 

Stories of incredible bravery and heroism emerged, including that of 22 year-old store worker Yohan Cohen, who was executed by Coulibaly when he tried to grab the fanatic’s gun, and Lassana Bathily who ushered the shoppers to the freezer, undoubtedly saving their lives. 

Mr Bathily, a Muslim of Malian descent, guided the terrified group of men, women and at least two young children, to the walk-in freezer in the basement. 

He said: ‘I turned off the lights and the fridge. I closed the door and told them to keep quiet.’ 

Mr Bathily then slipped away using a goods lift and was able to provide police with valuable information about what has happening inside the store.

Extremist: Amedy Coulibaly in a video released after his death in the standoff

Amedy Coulibaly began his terror rampage a day earlier than previously thought by shooting a jogger and planting a car bomb, it emerged yesterday.

The killer, who was shot dead by police after murdering four hostages in a Jewish shop on Friday, was thought to have struck first when he killed an unarmed policewoman last Thursday.

But now Paris prosecutors think he was responsible for seriously injuring a jogger in a suburb of the capital on January 7, the same day gunmen killed 12 during the Charlie Hebdo massacre.

A ‘martyrdom video’ of the fanatic, apparently filmed midway through the wave of terror attacks, appeared online yesterday. In it he urges Western Muslims to wage war against ‘enemies of Islam’.

The footage claims Coulibaly planted a bomb under a car on a Paris street, seemingly referring to an explosion on Wednesday night that authorities had not linked to the terror attacks.

Prosecutors said that tests on shell cases from the jogger shooting linked them to the weapon used at the kosher supermarket two days later.

The runner, who was attacked in the southwestern suburb of Fontenay-aux-Roses, has not been named but was left seriously wounded.

In the video, Coulibaly is shown sitting beside an AK47 and under an Islamic State flag as he declares that the terrorists’ actions were ‘completely legitimate’. ‘You cannot attack us and expect nothing in return,’ he says.

The slickly made film, which has been verified by intelligence experts, also shows the 32-year-old describing how he worked alongside the brothers who attacked Charlie Hebdo.

Separately, Coulibaly’s mother and sisters have condemned the atrocities and offered their ‘sincere condolences’ to the families of those killed.
