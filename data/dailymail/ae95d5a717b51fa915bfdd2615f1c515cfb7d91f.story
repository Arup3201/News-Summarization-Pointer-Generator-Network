Don’t get me wrong. Watching Amir Khan on a Floyd Mayweather card, in the wee small hours from Las Vegas, was a wonderful thing. However, Wembley Stadium, full house, local rivalry, and during pub hours… well that was something else entirely.

Sport-on-the-telly fans have been somewhat spoilt for choice for action from the FA’s headquarters recently. Culminating, you could be forgiven for thinking, with England’s parting shot before Rio. Not a bit of it, because Carl Froch and George Groves decided they would take their problem with each other outside.

It was, unfortunately, a double whammy if you wanted to see what the organisers did with the place in 24 hours flat. Firstly, you’d have to be someone who has bought into the principle of buying lots of your sport. And secondly, you’d have had to cough up extra to watch it live on Sky’s Box Office service.

I shall light that particular blue touch paper, and now gracefully retire from it. Because what is fundamentally important here is that between the channel and the event organisers, they put on a televisual experience that really said to me that the new Wembley has now arrived.

Those who didn’t go the whole hog and fork out £17 for the full night - and I imagine there were plenty of pubs, clubs and front rooms full of people who had all chipped in and did - were given a taste of what was to come for a tantalising 45 minutes on Sky Sports.

Johnny Nelson was tasked with being the host for the evening. Although he is clearly not a super slick live outside broadcast TV anchor, he certainly is a natural performer, with plenty of charm and, of course, tremendous boxing knowledge.

He was ‘pitchside’ for the night on a raised platform alongside Glenn McCrory and David Haye - whose silver grey suit positively shimmered in the resplendent late afternoon sun. What’s more, Anthony Joshua also stepped out into the sunlight and promptly delivered a perfectly-timed first-round win - a glimpse of what was to come before the action switched exclusively to Sky Box Office.

And as the sun started to set, so the scene was being set. As Kevin Mitchell was going about his business, the stadium began to fill up. But, more striking at that point than the sight of an enormous crowd, was the noise. There were still plenty of empty seats to be seen, but what could be heard was a hubbub that sounded like a torrent of rushing water. It was a maelstrom of excited chatter from tens of thousands of people all getting set for night to fall.

During the fight, the crowd were shown on the big screens the interview with Groves on arrival we were also seeing at home. A reaction that commentator Nick Halling described as a ‘mixture’. And he wasn’t wrong. It was a mixture of loud booing, and really loud booing.

Into the night then, and now we were presented with the full package. A stunning overhead shot captured the majesty of the moment. The bubbling cauldron that we could see through the roof, with spotlights dancing into the air, and the tiny hotspot of the ring in a sea of bodies. While outside, lamp posts and passing traffic gave the impression that the streets were apparently paved with gold.

Mind you, all the action wasn’t inside the ring. At around ten to 10, Groves was now running late and in danger of missing his bus. We saw a backstage shot of a rather flustered Sky Sports production assistant nervously explaining on his radio that he was unable to coax St George from his dressing room. Enter stage right Eddie Hearn who looked all set to go toe to toe with Groves himself.

Just as he was about to shout the odds, the door flew open, and out strode Groves, looking very much ready for business.

Knows how to put on a show! Groves' entrance for the bout was spectacular on a London bus

Earlier in the evening Froch had described the occasion as ‘proper gladiator days’.  And as he stood alone on a small stage, shadow boxing and soaking up the cacophony of sound from a dark abyss of people, the deal was sealed. Wembley burst out of the box. It had arrived.

And of course it got a fight, and a finish, that justified the build-up - worthy of the occasion itself.

Football is of course what Wembley is all about, but from what I watched in the corner of my room, this new incarnation of the stadium had just hosted a game of one-a-side that has rubber-stamped it as a sporting stage for something really special.

The package was worth the £17 charged on Box Office
