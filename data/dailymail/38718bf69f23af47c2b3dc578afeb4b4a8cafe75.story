One shows a group of 
children innocently playing chalk games in the street, one sees 
lightning fly across the sky above the recently-built Empire State 
Building and in another a shoemaker is smiling while eating his packed 
lunch.

Huge numbers of 
sheets and other laundry items are seen criss-crossing the gap between 
tenements, two men are photographed sitting by a relief in the Union 
Square park and the Brooklyn Bridge can be seen with a grey sky 
overhead.

These compelling portraits of everyday 
life between 1936 and 1951 drawn from the streets of New York City have 
been newly-released as part of an exhibit opening on Friday at the 
Jewish Museum in Manhattan.

 beach in Brooklyn and sailors are captured walking across Times Square.

The exhibition, called 'The Radical 
Camera: New York's Photo League, 1936-1951', recognises the role that an
 organisation of young, idealistic snappers played in seeing documentary
 photography as both an art form and a way to argue for social justice.

The photographers captured public and 
private moments, such as tenement balconies full of people angling for a
 good view of a passing parade, a woman gazing at a Bleecker Street 
bakery window and swing dancers in Harlem.

'The documentary photograph changed as
 a result of the really great teaching that distinguished the League in 
the form of (photographer) Sid Grossman,' said Jewish Museum curator 
Mason Klein.

‘(He) pushed his students to discover 
the meaning of their work, but also their relationship to it. That 
helped their work become more subjective and more poetic.'

Some images are beautiful and some are stark, with many commenting subtly on class, race and disparities of opportunity.

The League's darkroom, exhibition 
space, and its acclaimed newsletter 'Photo Notes' all drew photographers
 together in a space where they could socialise and exchange ideas. 
Women actively participated in the League where they found rare access 
and recognition.

'We were interested in the synergy of 
the League, that critical mass of artistry that resulted from the Photo 
League's panoply of activities,’ said Catherine Evans of the Columbus 
Museum of Art, which collaborated with The Jewish Museum on the exhibit.

Photographers Lewis Hine, Berenice 
Abbott and Paul Strand were mentors to the league while the younger 
generation included Mr Grossman, Morris Engel, Arthur Leipzig, Lisette 
Model, Ruth Sorkin, Walter Rosenblum, Aaron Siskind, W. Eugene Smith and many others.

The decade and a half of The Photo 
League's existence spanned the Great Depression, The New Deal, World War
 Two and, finally, the 'Red Scare' hunt for domestic Communists to which
 the League fell victim.

A December 5, 1947 front-page story in
 The New York Times: '90 Groups, Schools Named on U.S. List as Being 
Disloyal' proved the beginning of the end for the New York Photo League.

The League categorically denied the 
accusation in press releases, meetings, petitions, letters, articles, 
and even an exhibition - and for a while, the disclaimers worked, writes
 Houston photography curator Anne Wilkes Tucker in an essay in the 
exhibition's catalogue.

But as the blacklisting grew in intensity and reach, membership declined. The League dissolved on October 30, 1951.

'Fear killed The Photo League,' said 
Howard Greenberg, owner of a gallery bearing his name and an early 
collector and dealer of Photo League work. The blacklisting affected The
 Photo League even after it was disbanded.

'At least partly because of the 
suppression after the blacklisting, the significant role the League - 
and its teacher Sid Grossman - played in the evolution of the 
documentary photograph has not been fully recognized,' Mr Klein said.

'The subsequent generation of 
photographers was sort of apolitical. They were turned off to that idea 
of the documentary photograph as a political statement. And they were 
validated by the art world.'

The exhibit runs until March 25 next year and will then will travel to other U.S. cities.
