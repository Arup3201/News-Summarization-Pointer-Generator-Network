The heartbroken grandfather of the four children who burned to death during their mother's birthday party has left a poetic tribute at the scene.

Keith Smith, 56, left the poignant message for his loved ones after they perished in an attic room at the family home in Freckleton, near Preston.

The grieving man poured out his feelings following the tragic deaths of four-year-old twins Holly and Ella, two-year-old Jordan and their 19-year-old brother Reece, who died in a brave attempt to save his siblings.

Beautiful: The 56-year-old expressed his feelings in an achingly moving poem

Mr Smith, father of the children's inconsolable mother Michelle, addressed his note to 'Reece, Jordan, Ella, Holly.'

His poem reads: 'The time here you really shone/ A short lives you had/ Now your gone [sic].

'All my love was there to keep/ My life is broken all I do is weep.'

The bereft relative signs his message, in red marker pen, 'Grandad Smith, love you forever, till we meet again'.

His
tribute is propped against a white wooden fence placed outside the 
Lancashire home, on which someone has written: 'Please leave a message.'

Others have added: 'Your [sic] in my thoughts, sleep tight' and 'RIP'.

The wall is piled with flowers and teddy bears left by friends and family in tribute to the dead children.

Sobbing uncontrollably, Miss Smith returned to her converted bungalow last night accompanied by police officers, after the four children 
were pronounced dead at hospital.

Clutching a picture of her twin girls, all she could say was: ‘I have lost the lights of my life... Where can I turn?’

Investigation continues: Police confirmed there was a birthday party at the house, which remained sealed off yesterday

The full-time mother had invited 
friends round for a party on Saturday night when the fire apparently 
started in a loft conversion where the twins were sleeping.

Revellers spilled out on to the 
pavement in panic, before dialling 999 shortly before 11.30pm.

Yesterday
relatives described teenager Reece as a ‘hero’ after it emerged he went back 
inside the house to try to rescue the three children.

Miss Smith, who has three other 
daughters and two sons who live elsewhere, had also stayed in the home 
and had to be led to safety by firemen. She was unharmed.

Miss Smith’s father
said his blood ‘turned cold’ when he heard the story on the news early yesterday.

‘I rushed down here straight away, 
all the time wishing it wasn’t going to be true, but when I got here my 
worst nightmare came true,’ he said.

Outpouring: A teddy bear sits among piles of floral tributes outside the converted bungalow, with an envelope reading 'Angels' just visible. Other neighbours left notes expressing their sadness

‘I’m still trying to take it all in. They were smashing kids. The last time I saw them was at Christmas.'

They had moved into the house about two-and-a-half years ago and seemed very happy there. 
‘I’m still in shock. It is devastating news,’ he said.

Fighting back tears, he added: ‘It was 
Michelle’s birthday – I feel so sorry for her. They are cracking kids 
and she is a great mother.’

Police have begun an 
investigation into the tragedy and said they were keeping an ‘open mind’ as
to whether there were any suspicious circumstances.

Reports suggested the house had smoke alarms, but they were not working.

Miss Smith’s former partner, Colin 
Ostler, 42, said: ‘Michelle is in shock, she’s devastated, we all are, 
but it’s not really hit her yet. She’s too upset to talk about it, the 
enormity of what’s happened just hasn’t sunk in.’

Community in mourning: Tiny Ella, Jordan and Holly are believed to have only lived in the house for three months

'All hell broke loose': Neighbours said fire crews rushed to the scene where four of the Smith family lost their lives

Shocking: The twins' grandfather said he only heard of the tragedy on the news yesterday morning

Police and fire crews were confronted
with a ‘chaotic’ scene when they arrived, with many partygoers on the 
street in a distressed state.

Six firemen wearing breathing apparatus went inside the property and brought out the four children.

They were taken to the Royal Preston Hospital but declared dead.

Mr Ostler, who was in a relationship 
with Miss Smith for nine years and had three daughters, Bethany, 11, 
Jodie, ten, and Chloe, seven, with her, said Reece had died trying to save 
his siblings.

‘Reece died a hero,’ he said. ‘My 
three girls always stay with their mum on Friday nights and they wanted 
to stay on Saturday as well.

‘Thankfully, we said no and I took them home, otherwise who knows what could have happened.’ 

Mr Ostler, a part-time chef from 
Freckleton, added: ‘It is such a sad loss, it’s just horrendous, I can’t
get my head around it. Nobody should see their children die.’

Party: Police confirmed there was a gathering at the home which was attended by at least ten people

Big brother: Vibrant bouquets were adorned with messages to 'our best buddy and brother' Reece and a note from 'PippyJana and Grandad', saying the teenager would look after his siblings in heaven

Family friend Carolyn Milburn added: ‘It’s knocked us all for six. They were all lovely, all of them.

‘Lovely kids, well behaved, well brought up, always happy. Michelle is a good mum. She loves her kids.

‘I haven’t spoken to her yet but she and her mother, Christine, are both in a state.’

Detective Superintendent Andy Murphy, of Lancashire Police’s major investigation team, said they would be talking to a number of people who were at the house when the fire broke out.

‘We are keeping an open mind at this stage as to what happened,’ he added.

Tragic: Despite all four siblings being pulled from the home in Lytham Road, Freckleton, they were pronounced dead on arrival at the Royal Preston Hospital

Mourners: Friends and family left notes and gifts for each of the children individually
