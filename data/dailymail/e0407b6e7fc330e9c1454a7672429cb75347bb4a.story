A businessman's dream of sailing around the world ended in tragedy after he fell from a yacht he'd bought hours earlier and died in the cold waters of The Solent, a coroner heard today.

Hany Mustapha, 46, from Worcester Park, Surrey, had just picked up a 21ft sloop bought through eBay and set sail in strong winds from Poole, Dorset, running into trouble minutes later.

The yacht was discovered 'ghosting' hours later, running aground deserted on the Isle of Wight with its engine still running.

Tragic: Hany Mustapha, 46, with his wife Liz Brown. He died of hypothermia in The Solent after falling overboard from a yacht he'd bought just hours earlier as part of a plan to sail around the world

A major air and sea search was launched but Mr Mustapha’s body was not found until it washed up on a nearby beach, five days later.

The wealthy IT company director died from hypothermia rather than drowning, the island's coroner heard today. The inquest heard he was not as experienced as he believed and fell overboard just hours after buying the boat.

Mr Mustapha was a member of a local motor yachting club on the River Thames and had completed a one-week sailing course with his second wife, Liz, in Turkey in 2011.

He was also studying for his Master Yachtsman certificate in his spare time.

However, the coroner said he had 'over-estimated his ability' when he attempted to sail single-handed in The Solent on October 27 last year.

Cold winds were almost at gale force strength, throwing up 15ft waves as Mr Mustapha ventured out on his solo voyage aboard his new boat, Brigand, from Poole harbour.

He had bought the boat just hours before from airline pilot Sydney Mills, of Sherborne, Dorset, who had given him a 'comprehensive brief' of how to sail the boat, the coroner heard.

It was thought that the businessman had not got far out of Poole harbour when he fell overboard in the choppy seas.

He died of the cold within an hour 
after becoming stranded in sea temperatures of less than 12 degrees 
Celsius, the inquest heard.

The father of two was wearing a basic buoyancy aid instead of a self-inflating lifejacket at the time.

He
 was also wearing 'inappropriate' trainers instead of non-slip boating 
shoes and had not connected himself to the 'kill cord' which would have 
cut power to the engine when he fell overboard, the coroner heard.

Mr Mustapha’s body was discovered face down in the shallows of Sandown Bay on the Isle of Wight on November 1 last year. He had large bruises to his forehead and nose.

The inquest was told that the injuries may have been caused by the boom on the boat swinging around violently, knocking the 6ft 4ins tall father into the sea and leaving him stranded as his new yacht motored on ahead of him.

Coroner Caroline Sumeray recorded that the tee-total father’s death was a 'terrible and tragic accident.'

She added: 'Whilst it is clear Hany Mustapha had some experience of boats and some experience of marine qualifications, he I think over-estimated his abilities in respect of that trip he took in those conditions on that day.'

The London-based businessman had paid Mr Mills £900 for the small wooden sailing boat as a 46th birthday present to himself and had plans to sail around the world with his wife of 11 years.

Mr Mills said Mr Mustapha 'appeared very competent' and told him he was a Master Yachtsman - which was untrue.

However, the former Royal Navy aviator admitted to having 'concerns' after he noticed Mr Mustapha's footwear.

'It was the shoes he was wearing. He was wearing black trainers but they were not deck shoes as far as I was aware. They didn’t have a non-slip sole on them.

'There was just something niggling in the back of my head - it was the shoes and the lifejacket and all the kit he had was brand new.

'It was shiny and hadn’t been used. It was not scuffed - it was brand new stuff.'

However, he said Mr Mustapha had assured him he was a Master Yachtsman and he left him to set sail after he had given his buyer a 'comprehensive brief' of the boat.

Mr Mills said he walked to the mouth of Poole harbour and snapped a few photos and a video of the boat he had owned for 10 years as Mr Mustapha sailed out just after 10am.

He was the last person to see the businessman alive.

Mr Mustapha’s wife, Liz Brown, whom he married in 2001, told the coroner of the horror of receiving the call from coastguards that her husband had disappeared.

The alarm was raised after Brigand washed up at Grange Chine, Isle of Wight, at 5.20pm. It still had its engine running as it crashed into the shore.

Ms Brown said she had arranged to call her husband at midday and every two hours to check his progress but had struggled to get through.

'I just assumed he was in an area with no phone signal,' she said.

'As soon as I heard this guy say he was the coastguard I knew something awful had happened.

'He said the boat had been found off the Isle of Wight but Hany was not on it. My heart sank. It’s all a bit of a blur from there.'

Ms Brown, who said she met her husband while they worked for pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline in 1997, was co-director in their IT consultancy firm which they set up in 2000.

She said they had joined Thames Motor Yacht Club in Surrey in September 2011, and planned to travel together.

'The aim was to retire early and go around the world. It’s something he had discussed for quite a while,' she told the inquest.

Sad: Despite a major major air and sea search, Mr Mustapha's body was not found until five days after his boat when he washed up ashore face down in the shallows of Sandown Bay. His face was badly bruised

The day before picking up the new yacht, Mr Mustapha had celebrated his birthday at a Chinese restaurant in Surrey with his wife, his daughters from his first marriage, Nadia and Madeline, his Egyptian-born parents, his sister May, aged 47 years, and her three children.

He then caught a train from Surbiton, Surrey, to Poole, Dorset at 11pm and stayed in a Holiday Inn Express in the town that night before picking up the boat in the morning.

His daughter Nadia was not in court, but her younger sister sobbed as details of his death were revealed.

Mr Mustapha’s Egytian-born surgeon father, Nabil, was also at the inquest to hear the evidence and took notes throughout the proceedings.

Paying tribute to her husband at the inquest today, his widow said: 'He was quite a tall chap at 6ft 4ins and I think his personality matched his physical height.

'Everybody who met him remembered his character. He was a very friendly person, he would go out of his way to help anybody even if he didn’t know them. He was a very kind man.

'He was very intelligent - he had run his own company for a number of years. And he was always good company to be around.

'He was always the life and soul of the party.'
