A one-cent coin has sold at auction for $140,000 - 14 million times its original price.

An international bidding war erupted for the rare bronze coin dating from 1793, the year the United States Mint first opened.

The coin had been tipped to sell for around $4,560, but 10 keen bidders sent the price soaring at the Bonhams auction in London yesterday.

A coin collector struck gold with the sale of a rare one-inch bronze coin dating from 1793 for $140,000

Eventually an anonymous coin collector placed the winning bid - at more than 30 times the estimate.

John Millenstead, head of coins and medals at Bonhams, said: 'Although the coin is quite rare and in good condition, we are slightly bewildered that it went for quite so much.

'There was a real frenzy at the auction with six people in the room and four more on the phones all wanting the coin.

'The US in the 1790s was not the country it is now, and so the amount of cents produced would have been relatively few.

A highly competitive auction at Bonhams in Knightsbridge, London drove up the price to more than 30 times the expected sale price

In 1792 Congress called for the establishment of a national mint.

Because Philadelphia was then the nation's capital, it was built there and it started producing coins in 1793.

The one-inch coin features an image of Liberty on one side and a three leaf sprig on the other side.

In today's money, one cent is worth just 0.6 of a penny.

Mr Millenstead explained: 'Coins like this don't come up at auction very often and the fact it has survived all these years in good condition made it collectable.

'It seems sometimes when people set their heart on something they have to have it.

'It also goes to show that it is worth checking your old coins.'

Other big sellers at yesterday's auction in Knightsbridge included a collection of 19th and early 20th Century coins from China which went for $30,134, and a single gold Egyptian coin from the reign of Ptolemy VI in 180-145 BC that sold for $8,766.

The record price among American coins belongs to the 1933 Double Eagle, the only legal copy of a coin that never made it into circulation.

It sold at a 2002 auction for $7.6 million.
