After handing herself in early Lindsay Lohan has been released from jail after a mere 4.5 hours in custody.

LiLo enjoyed a last supper with friends before she checked into the Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood, CA , last night just before 9pm to begin serving her 30-day jail sentence.

She didn't need to pack an overnight bag though as she was released at approximately 1:30am and headed back to her rented home having spent almost as much time out eating sushi earlier in the evening as she spent behind bars. Her early release is thought to be due to overcrowding in prison.

Lindsay must now complete the remaining 53 days of her community service, including at least 12 days a month at the county morgue.

The sentence also requires Lohan to undergo 18 psychotherapy sessions and appear monthly at court hearings between December 2011 and March 2012.

Judge Sautner also said Lindsay can no longer leave the country and needs the permission of her new 'no-nonsense' probation officer to travel outside California.

Lohan will have to serve 423 hours at the county morgue, where for nearly two weeks she has been scrubbing floors, cleaning toilets and washing dirty sheets.

After jailing LiLo, Judge Sautner said: 'You are not to get house arrest or early release, except for that required by the law.'

The sentence marked her fifth jail 
term since her arrest in 2007 for drunken driving. After her sentencing, 
Los Angeles County Sheriff spokesman, Steve Whitmore said: 'It's 
possible she could be booked in and booked out the same day.

'It depends on the fluctuations of the day, what's going on in the jail.'

The 25-year-old was set to begin her 
30 day jail sentence after being found guilty of violating her probation
 and was ordered to check in to the Lynwood Regional Correctional 
Facility before November 9 but found time to tie up some loose ends 
first.

On Saturday night LiLo and friends went to Wabi-Sabi Sushi and Asian restaurant for a low key dinner.

She seemed in high spirits as she laughed in the bar, which is just a stone's throw from her home in the trendy enclave.

The actress has had a busy few days and reportedly stripped for Playboy on Wednesday.

It has just been revealed that in the tasteful shoot Lindsay will channel her idol Marilyn Monroe as she did in a 2003 shoot in New York magazine.

The magazine will also feature an interview with the troubled star.

But
 it is said the shoot was the second for Lindsay after Hefner decided he
 wasn't happy with the first set of photos and hired a new photographer.

Sources told RadarOnline: 'Lindsay 
was told that the Playboy executives wanted to go another direction with
 her shoot so they asked her to come back for a second time.

'There
 is never a guarantee that everyone will like the photos or that they 
will be of high enough quality to use for the cover, but Playboy wanted 
to make sure that Lindsayâ€™s pictures were exactly what they wanted.'

On Wednesday, Lindsay waived her 
rights at her probation violation hearing at the Los Angeles Superior 
Court Airport Branch and admitted the violation.

Judge Stephanie Sautner ordered the actress so surrender to the jail by Wednesday.

She was not immediately put behind bars because the judge decided to allow her time to complete her nude photo shoot for Playboy, according to TMZ.

The star's lawyer, Shawn Holley, is 
understood to have told the judge in chambers that her client had a 
$1million contract with Hugh Hefner's publication.

As
 well as serving the jail time the actress must continue her community 
service at the Los Angeles county morgue.But TMZ reported that she may 
serve just minutes behind bars.

A
 source within the Sheriff's Department told the website that if someone
 receives a misdemeanor sentence of 90 days or less, they are routinely 
processed in and then released.
