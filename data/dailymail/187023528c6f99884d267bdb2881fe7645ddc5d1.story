A suspected robber in Missouri learned the hard way that you don't mess with a bank president - especially one who's packing a Colt .380 pistol at all times.

David Thompson, 58, who has stood at the helm of Peoples Bank and Trust in the city of Troy for the past 36 years, turned the tables on a would-be robber wearing a Halloween mask by pulling a gun on him in the parking lot and detaining him until police arrived.

‘I didn’t have time to get scared,’ Thompson, a life member of the National Rifle Association who supports concealed-carry laws, told the St Louis Post-Dispatch.

Armed: Bank President David Thompson, 58, followed and restrained a robber who made off with $5,000 from his bank in Troy, Missouri

Scene of the robbery: The People's Bank and Trust in Troy, where David Thompson has been president for 36 years

Clear warning: A notice on the front door of the bank makes it clear that staff carry concealed weapons - as the would-be assailant found out to his cost

‘I was excited. Your adrenaline pumps. He robbed a bank, he menaced my employees, and I don’t allow that.’

Thompson later learned that the suspect who attempted to hold up the bank on Tuesday, identified as 58-year-old Donald Lee, was one of his customers.

The brave bank president said he was surprised that someone would try to rob the establishment since there is a notice on the front door clearly indicating that 'lawful concealed carry permitted on these premises.'     

Police said at around 2.30pm on Tuesday, a man in a Chucky mask walked into the bank at 430 East Wood Street and demanded that tellers hand him all the money they had.

Thompson was in his office when his receptionist alerted him to the situation playing out in the lobby.

When
the banker looked out, he saw a man wearing a heavy jacket and a mask 
walking away from the tellers carrying a red bag with $4,779 in cash.

That
is when Thompson, who has a black belt in martial arts, jumped into 
action, following the man outside and locking the door behind him so as 
not to put anyone else at risk.

Bank robber: Donald Lee, 58, was a customer at the bank. He walked in wearing a Chucky mask and demanded all the money in the bank. He made off with $4,779

Frightening: Lee, seen here on CCTV footage, pretended he was carrying a firearm and demanded money. It later emerged he was unarmed

Hold-up: The bank clerk handed over nearly $5,000. The robber was followed by bank president David Thompson, who restrained him at gunpoint until police arrived

There were about 60 employees in the three-storey building and a few customers in the bank at the time.

Thompson then drew his Colt .380 pistol and ordered Lee to get out of his car. When the 58-year-old suspect reached into his jacket as if he had a gun, Thompson told him: ‘Sir, you don’t want to do that or this will end badly.'

The quick-thinking banker grabbed Lee’s hand and got him out of the Ford pickup truck, after which he stood guard over the alleged crook and prevented him from fleeing.

By that point, another bank employee, who also had a concealed weapon on him, came out of the building and helped Thompson keep an eye on Lee until police arrived about a minute later.

Pursuit: Mr Thompson is seen following Lee into the bank's car park, where he restrained him with a Colt .380 pistol

Unfazed: Mr Thompson, an NRA member, said he didn't fear for his personal safety in pursuing the assailant

During the police search, Thompson found out that Lee had a debit card from Peoples Bank and Trust, which he received when he opened an account there six months earlier, according to the Lincoln County Journal. Police also revealed that he was not armed.

Lee has been charged with first-degree robbery, and his bail bond has been set at $50,000, cash only.

Peoples Bank and Trust was last robbed in the 1930s, but all the employees receive training on handing emergency situations like this one every year.

In the aftermath, Thompson praised his tellers for remaining calm and handling the robbery by the book.

The banker added that at no time was he worried for his own safety because according to him, the robber appeared ‘frail and slow-moving.’

Lee told police he’d gone to the bank only to trick or treat. According to a neighbor, the 58-year-old moved to Troy from Oklahoma about a year ago to live with his daughter and grandchildren, and he may be suffering dementia or Alzheimer’s.
