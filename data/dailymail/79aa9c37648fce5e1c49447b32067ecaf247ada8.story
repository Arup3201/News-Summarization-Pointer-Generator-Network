Shocking footage has emerged of AFL fans dragging, spitting on and verbally abusing street preachers after a football game at Adelaide Oval.

The video was taken on June 29 right outside the stadium following a Round 15 clash where the Adelaide Crows triumphed over Port Adelaide Power.

In the YouTube footage, uploaded by a group who call themselves evAngeliis, the unprovoked attack involves fans of both teams verbally abusing then physically attacking a trio of men spreading the word of God.

Adelaide Crows and Port Adelaide Power supporters are seen abusing street preachers outside Adelaide Oval

The footage shows fans dragging, spitting on and verbally abusing the trio

It is one of four videos on the channel where they are seen taking their gospel to the streets of the South Australian capital.

Just before the 23-minute mark, a man wearing a Port Adelaide scarf walks up to the trio - who are identified only as David, Daniel and Brad - and gives them the finger while yelling: 'F*** you, you c**ts. You f**king losers.'

Someone then throws a beer at them while the man walks away but not before he spits one of the preachers filming the incident.

Minutes later another man - this time wearing an Adelaide Crows jersey - approaches them and asks them: 'Why do you have to throw your [beliefs] in people's faces? Let them believe what they want.'

One of the men who approached the preachers yelled expletives at them and gave them the finger before spitting on them

The man gets increasingly aggressive and then starts pushing them, saying: 'F**k you' to each of the preachers.

One of the man's friends goes to shake the hand of the preacher holding the camera, but then attempts to knock the sign out of his grasp.

As the video continues, things start to escalate as more of the attacker's friends join in. At one point, one man says: 'God sucks, God is the worse' - attempting to grab the sign again.

The alleged instigator starts pushing them around and tells them to 'get out'.

One of his friends then drags two of the preachers down a slope while trying to wrestle a placard away from them.

Before it goes any further, a police siren sounds and officers intervene, while the attackers scatter.

Both sporting clubs have said they had not received any complaints about the incident.

Port Adelaide chief executive officer Keith Thomas condemned the actions of punters, saying the behaviour captured in the video was unacceptable.

'We take a very dim view of his actions,' he said.

'As a club, we have recently implemented a strict spectator code of conduct that encourages all our supporters to behave in an appropriate manner and refrain from hostile, intimidating and abusive behaviour of any kind.

'And this code of conduct applies to our supporters wearing our club colours both inside the stadium or on the way home.'

A spokesman for the Crows echoed Mr Thomas' response.

'We believe everyone has the right to come and go, and attend our matches, without abuse or harassment,' he said.

'Football should be fun and enjoyable for all patrons.'

The spokesman said the Adelaide football club also had a strict code of conduct for fans that needed to be followed.

'Breaches of this code can result in someoneâ€™s membership being cancelled,' he said.

A South Australia police spokesman said officers at the scene did not press any charges at the time as the preachers did not report the assault.

It was just a snapshot of some the abuse they were subjected to

South Australia police eventually broke up the scuffle after two minutes
