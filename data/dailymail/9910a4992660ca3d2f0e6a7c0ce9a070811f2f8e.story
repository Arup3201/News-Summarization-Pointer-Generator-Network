A stately home that has been owned by no less than three British monarchs since it was built nearly 1,000 years ago is for sale for nearly £5m.

Horton Priory, which was built in the early 1100s, was owned by King Henry I, King Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I, among other illustrious owners.

But they would be hard-pressed to recognise the Grade I-listed, 11-bedroom house now, complete as it is with cinema room, gym, heated swimming pool and four air-conditioned wine cellars.

House with a history: Horton Priory was owned by Henry I, Henry VIII, and Elizabeth I during its 900-odd year history

Spread over more than 20,000sq ft, Horton Priory is the size of 21 'average-sized' three-bedroom modern homes.

Quite understandably, the current owners of the stunning stately home near Ashford in Kent want to downsize, and have put it on the market with upmarket estate agents Savills with a price tag of £4.95m.

Given that it's one of the UK's oldest homes, it's no surprise Horton Priory has a history to match.

The Priory was owned by Henry I before being passed to the Roman Catholic Congregation of Cluny, whose monks ran it as Cluniac monastery for centuries until the 1500s.

Following the dissolution of the monasteries, Henry VIII seized ownership of Horton Priory from the monks, and he later passed it on to his daughter, Queen Elizabeth, before it was given to the Mantell family in 1570.

The Priory has 55 acres of land and has undergone an extensive restoration under the guidance of English Heritage.

Complete with medieval fishponds, Horton Priory also boasts a more modern heated swimming pool

Will Peppitt, a director in Savills country department, said: 'There are not many houses which date back as far as the 12th century, let alone that have been owned by three monarchs.

'Its charm and value lie in the fact that it is an imposing stately home but also a beautiful family property, too.

'Horton Priory has only been on the market for a week and three people have seen it, with two already very interested.

'The people who want a home like this appreciate it as a fascinating piece of architecture. It really is in the premier league of properties.'

Initially built as a Cluniac monastery , the house now boasts a stunning bespoke kitchen and four air-conditioned wine cellars

Horton Priory has fireplaces from the Tudor, Elizabethan and Edwardian eras, including this one in the panelled dining room

Whether that is a hint towards a celebrity footballer purchaser remains to be seen, but there's no doubting that despite its grandeur and history, Horton Priory has many of the toys wealthy footballers see as necessities in their homes.

As well as a heated swimming pool, tennis court, croquet lawn, putting green and golf driving range, the Priory boasts four air-conditioned wine cellars with double bins, a cinema, sewing room and table-tennis room.

It also has more traditional features, including a Tudor doorway leading into a vaulted area with ruins of the 12th Century church and priory buildings, and a wooden minstrels' gallery.

The priory, which was home to Roman Catholic monks for centuries, has been meticulously renovated

Horton Priory has a series of interconnecting reception rooms situated off a 'long gallery' including drawing, dining and sitting rooms with fireplaces from the Tudor, Elizabethan and Edwardian eras.

Outside there are sweeping lawns overlooking ancient pastures, with a ha-ha, ponds, orchard and kitchen garden with automated irrigation system.

The grounds contain the site of an earlier Iron Age settlement, pre-dating the Roman conquest and now designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument Site.

After the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII, the house passed from the King, via a short spell in the hands of Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, to Richard Tate.  It then passed to the Mantell family, before being owned by Elizabeth I, and then being passed back to the Mantell family who owned it for another 300 years.

The house - one of only a handful of Cluniac priories still standing in Britain today - also boasts the ruins of a Norman church in its grounds.
