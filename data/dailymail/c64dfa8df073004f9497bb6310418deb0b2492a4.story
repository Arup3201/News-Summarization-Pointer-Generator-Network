A stunned homeowner has filmed himself setting fire to highly flammable water gushing from his bathroom tap.

In the clip uploaded to YouTube, Jacob Haughney produces a intensely bright yellow fireball to erupt from a flowing tap by putting a lighter flame to the liquid.

Mr Haughney, who works on oil fields near his home in North Dakota, discovered the worrying phenomenon while in the shower.

'Just found out something out about the tap water we bathe in and that we use to brush our teeth and it's pretty weird,' he said.

He added: 'First time I did it there was a huge fireball - took up the entire sink - so that's why I'm a little jumpy going it. I don't want to blow up the bathroom.'

His video has been viewed more than 237,000 times since being uploaded to YouTube just over a week ago.

It has been speculated that the explosive tap water is the result of oil drilling nearby - specifically if it has anything to with hydraulic 
fracturing, which is popularly known as 'fracking'.

This
 is the process by which natural gas is extracted by using water, sand 
and toxic chemicals injected at high pressure into oil of methane gas 
deposits to fracture the rock above and release the liquid or gas below.

Fracking involves releasing natural 
gas trapped in shale formations by blasting a mix of water, sand and 
chemicals into the rock.

It has unlocked reserves that could 
supply the U.S. for 100 years, although environmentalists say that 
fracking can contaminate water supplies.

North Dakota, which is home to just 
700,000 people, is the centre of a fracking boom.

It
 is now the second largest oil-producing state in America, producing 
more than 911,000 barrels a day - largely due to the use of fracking 
technology.

Campaigners against fracking have previously documented flammable water.

Invented in 1949, hydraulic fracking involves drilling more than 7,000ft down into gas-bearing shale before pumping a mixture of water and sand at high pressure into the shale, causing tiny fractures which allow long-term release of gas.

In the US large-scale fracking since 2005 has caused energy prices to plummet, sparked economic recovery and cut greenhouse gas emissions to levels last seen in 1990.

However, survey by the Pew Research Center showed the public’s growing anxiety over fracking.

Almost half (49 per cent) of those polled in a recent survey opposed the increased use of fracking — up from 38 per cent people in a similar survey in March — while 44 per cent were in favour.

The skepticism comes as the industry is making concerted efforts to change the ingredients used in fracking fluids and focusing on recycling the water it consumes.

In
 2012, activist Sherry Vargson, from Granville Township, Pennsylvania, 
produced a video of her lighing water flowing from her kitchen tap.

Vargson
 and the 'Gas Drilling Awareness Coalition' claimed the water has become
 flammable because of increased methane levels in the surrounding rock 
which had been disturbed by the controversial fracking activity.

While
 Pennsylvania regulators did fine the Chesapeake energy Corp $900,000 
for contaminating the water supplies of 16 homes in Bradford County with
 methane, there has been no conclusive evidence that fracking was to 
blame.

But one commenter on Mr Haughney's video insisted there could be other reasons for the flames.

YouTube user shorefisherman said: 'It's completely natural, and is very common here in rural North Dakota where many people have a private well for their water source. 

'Many aquifers out here are what we call "gassy wells" there's areas underground where natural gasses like methane are trapped in the ground with the water and bubble up the plumbing when you turn a faucet on. 

'Been that way long before fracking ever started in this state﻿.'
