A mother who ordered her typical McDonald's sandwich got a shocking surprise when she found a swastika burned on the bun with butter. 

Charleigh Matice went to a McDonald's drive-thru in Morehead City, North Carolina earlier this month to pick up dinner for herself and her daughter. 

When she opened the McChicken sandwich to add mayonnaise, she was met with the offensive Nazi symbol.

Charleigh Matice was served a McDonald's McChicken sandwich earlier this month in Morehead City, North Carolina with a swastika burned onto the bun in butter 

Ms Matice, who went to the drive-thru to pick up food for her and her daughter, said that she was totally shocked and lost her appetite when she opened her food

Ms Matice told News 12 that her grandfather had served in World War Two and that she was shocked that someone could be so ignorant. 

She said: 'Many people died because of that symbol and it’s not something that should be taken lightly. It’s not something that should be thrown around.' 

She asked for a refund for the sandwich because she had lost her appetite. She then asked for the matter to be taken to the corporate headquarters to help improve training for staff. 

The employee who put the symbol on the sandwich has been fired. 

Dulcy Purcell, the local McDonald's owner in Morehead City, told MailOnline today: 'We are very sorry for the service that our customers received, and to be clear we have terminated the employee who was involved. 

'We do not tolerate that kind of behavior at McDonald's, and it's not what we stand for personally as owners. It is about providing the best level of service and care to our customers, and anything less than that is unacceptable to us.' 

Ms Macie said that she is a loyal customer of McDonald's and she plans to return to the restaurant.  

McDonald's apologized for the offensive gesture and said the employee who pasted the swastika on to the sandwich has been fired
