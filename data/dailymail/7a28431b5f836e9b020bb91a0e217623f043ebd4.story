Motorists watched in horror as a huge lorry careered onto the wrong side of a busy motorway, right into the path of oncoming cars.

The fully-laden HGV smashed through the central reservation of the M40, crushing a silver Mercedes E-class under its wheels in the rush-hour accident this morning.

Astonishingly the Mercedes driver escaped without serious injury after his £40,000 car was trapped under the jack-knifed lorry near Warwick.

Eyewitnesses said the lorry was travelling northbound between junctions 16 and 15 of the M40 near Warwick when it lost control and ploughed through the central reservation.

It destroyed the barrier before partially overturning, leaving one side jack-knifed in the air with the Mercedes underneath.

Remarkably neither driver was seriously injured in the crash, which occurred at 7.45am as motorists headed to work.

One driver said: 'I couldn't believe my eyes when the lorry went flying through the barrier.  It just smashed through the barrier like it wasn't there and collided with a few cars on the wrong side.

'It was just a mess, and then suddenly I looked again and there was a Mercedes stuck underneath the lorry.

'How nobody got seriously hurt I just don't know.'

Police warned motorists to avoid the area as 10 mile queues built up on the southbound M40 and the adjoining M42.

Officers said the M40 would be shut between junction 16 for Henley-in-Arden and junction 15 for Warwick for several hours.

A
 spokesman for Warwickshire Police said: 'There are not thought to be 
any serious injuries but the incident caused major delays.

'The lorry was fully laden and had collided with at least one car.'

West Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed one person involved in the crash had been taken to hospital with a leg injury and suffering back pain.
