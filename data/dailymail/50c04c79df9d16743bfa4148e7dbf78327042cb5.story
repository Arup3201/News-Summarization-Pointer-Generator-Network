TV presenter Fiona Phillips today hit out at the 'decline' of Britain's high streets after the shop where her mother worked closed down.

The former GMTV star said giants such as Tesco and Wetherspoon are wiping out traditional shops and pubs.

Ms Phillips told of her sadness after the small department store in her hometown announced it is shutting down after 103 years.

Fiona Phillips's late mother worked at Ocky White in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, which is closing after Marks & Spencer opened up on an out-of-town retail park

TV presenter Fiona Phillips today hit out at the 'decline' of Britain's high streets after the shop where her mother, Amy (pictured left with Fiona), worked closed down

The presenter's late mother Amy worked at Ocky White in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, which is closing after Marks & Spencer opened up on an out-of-town retail park.

Ms Phillips, 52, said: 'It is actually disgusting - our high streets and town centres are being destroyed.

'Haverfordwest has one of the prettiest high streets in the country but it smells of stagnation and decline.

'All the local pubs are closing down because chains like Wetherspoon are moving in.

'I was appalled when I saw Tesco come in. How is the high street supposed to compete with that?

Ocky White will close in the summer with the loss of 47 jobs, marking the end of an era. Fiona's mother died in 2006 after a long battle against Alzheimer's disease

'They do clothes, electronics, books ... everything. It's an absolute travesty.

'It's ruining communities. People meet, hang around in the square and there were lovely little coffee shops.

'Family businesses are so rare now and I am so sad to hear that the business will not be handed down.'

Mother-of-two Phillips said: 'Mum began working for the company's drapery business as a teenager. The staff there were amazing. It was like a huge family and they were wonderful to my mother'

Bookshops, electrical stores, men's fashion outlets and travel agents are all suffering from decline as customers turn to the internet for bargains.

Off-licences, bars and pubs are also being hit by the growing popularity of cheap supermarket alcohol, as household spending power continues to drop.

Tellingly, the stores that are bucking the trend and growing their presence on the high street include pawn brokers, credit unions and pound shops.

London fared worst in 2011, with 1,084 shops shutting and just 983 opening, according to a study by Pricewaterhouse Coopers and the Local Data Company last year.

Yorkshire and Humberside, North East and South West England, eastern England and Scotland also suffered.

Experts say part of the blame lies in firms having taken on long leases in too many locations during boom years.

Ocky White will close in the summer with the loss of 47 jobs, marking the end of an era.

Ms Phillips met up with some of her 
mother's workmates when she starred in Coming Home, a BBC Wales 
programme which traces the family history of celebrities.

Her mother died in 2006 after a long battle against Alzheimer's disease.

Mother-of-two Phillips said: 'Mum began working for the company's drapery business as a teenager.

'The staff there were amazing.

'It was like a huge family and they were wonderful to my mother.'

The store's managing director Jeremy White said: 'It's very sad for everyone involved with the business.

'I am particularly mindful of all the loyal and dedicated members of my staff who now find themselves without a job.'
