Police are solving less than a third of all crimes reported, with conviction rates varying depending on where people live. 

Figures released by the Ministry of Justice reveal that criminals are more likely to escape prosecution in London, where fewer than a quarter are caught.

On public transport conviction rates are even worse, with just 13 per cent of all crimes solved by British Transport Police.

New figures released by the Ministry of Justice show that police are solving fewer than one in three crimes 

Despite overall crime falling since 2004, conviction rates have remained at just 30 per cent, the Daily Mirror reported. 

In total, there were 3.5 million crimes committed in England and Wales during 2013/14, but only a million ended in a criminal being convicted.

Around 704,000 crimes were reported in London over the past year, but the Metropolitan Police managed to solve 169,000 of these cases - 24 per cent. 

In Wales the situation is more positive. In the last 12 months the force convicted 10,800 criminals for 18,600 - a success rate of 58 per cent. 

Police forces in Northumbria, Cumbria, Norfolk and Hertfordshire all have success rates of more than 40 per cent and appear in the top five in a list of conviction rates. 

The Metropolitan Police, appears in the lowest five forces for conviction rates. 

Warwickshire, West Midlands and Bedfordshire also appear in this group with low conviction rates - less than the average 29 per cent for England and Wales. 

British Transport Police, which covers crimes on railways and roads is at the bottom of the conviction rate league table - with a success rate of just 13 per cent. 

The figures include crimes where an offender has accepted a caution, or where a crime has been 'taken into consideration' as part of other proceedings.

A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said the force had 'introduced measures to bring more offenders to justice as part of our total war on crime.'

However, despite the low conviction rates, it is feared that the prison population could swell by 15 per cent by 2020 to almost 100,000 - leaving jails struggling to cope with a surge in violent and sexual offenders. The Ministry of Justice predicted the number of prisoners in England and Wales will rise every year until the end of the decade. 

It means thousands more prison places will be needed, because the current capacity is only 88,015. 

Sex offenders are also being jailed for longer, with average sentences increasing by 2.4 months to almost six years when compared to 2013.
