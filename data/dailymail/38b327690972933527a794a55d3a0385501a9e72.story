Two Russian policemen have been fired over the death of a comatose murder suspect after they dragged him out of a hospital's intensive care ward and tried to check him in as luggage on a flight back to the station.

The officers Fedor Moroz, 41, and Yuriy Koudinov, 45, had been alerted that the wanted man, 36-year-old Sergei Kozhemyakin, had been admitted to Balabanovskaya City Hospital in Western Russia's Kaluga Oblast.

Despite the fact that he was in a critical condition, they went to the hospital and dragged him out of the bed without informing hospital staff.

They then drove him to Moscow's Vnukovo Airport and tried to persuade staff from the UTair airline to accept the man as a passenger on a flight back to Stavropol.

When they refused on the grounds that he was unconscious, the officers then reportedly tried to have him declared as baggage and put him into the luggage hold.

Once again blocked by the airline, the officers eventually decided to handcuff the man to a chair, and spent the night in the airport departure lounge hoping to get a flight with a different airline the next day.

During the night, he appeared to have trouble breathing but they again refused to allow airport police to take the injured man to hospital.

Allegations: The man, Sergei Kozhemyakin, 36, was wanted on suspicion of murdering a mayoral aide

Dragged: They dragged him to the airport, tried to check him in as a passenger and then as luggage

He reportedly died while the argument was going on.

Kozhemyakin was wanted on suspicion of ordering the murder of Arkady Georgiadi, a mayoral aide in the Stavropol region town of Mineralnye Vody who was shot at point-blank range by two assailants in 2008.

The perpetrators were arrested soon after, though police had been searching for Kozhemyakin who had gone missing until he was discovered when he checked into the hospital in a critical condition.

It was not clear how he had ended up injured and in hospital and Russian police confirmed they are investigating the incident.

Eventually, they handcuffed him to a chair were he died that night. Despite being caught on camera, officers Fedor Moroz and Yuriy Koudinov, who have now been fired, claim they did nothing wrong

Meanwhile, the two officers, who were caught on video dragging the unconscious man across the floor at the airport, have denied that they did anything wrong.

'We asked a nurse and she told us that it was fine to move the man and he didn't need to be in hospital any more,' said Yuriy Koudinov.
