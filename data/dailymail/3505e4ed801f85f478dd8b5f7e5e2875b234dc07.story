For something that seems so harmless, paper is surprisingly capable of cutting through skin.

Now one designer has decided to use this ability, by harnessing the power of paper cuts for shaving.

San Francisco-based Nadeem Haidary has designed an origami razor concept that could one day be used in place of plastic disposal razors.

‘Paper Cut Razor takes a seemingly outrageous idea and makes it real,’ writes Haidary on his website.

The razor concept is constructed out of a sheet of water-resistant paper.

It has three slits that the designer believes could act like metal blades. 

The razors would be sold as a flat pack with users having to put them together by making a few origami folds. 

As the razor is made from paper, it can be recycled far more easily that its plastic equivalent. 

‘It’s a fictional product that playfully challenges two notions: that paper cuts are inherently evil, and that current disposable razors are truly disposable.’

The result is a razor concept constructed entirely out of a sheet of water-resistant paper that can be recycled after use.

Like multi-blade razors, the Paper Cut Razor has three slits that the designer believes could act like metal blades.

Haidary envisions selling these razors as a flat pack, with users having to put them together by making a few origami folds.

As the razor is made from paper, it can be recycled far more easily that its plastic equivalent. 

The artist has even created paper origami designs for other products including glasses, scissors and a toothbrush.

While the design is still an idea, Haidary has created an animation of the paper razor in action which shows how it might work.

‘When’s the last time a paper cut felt this good?,’ he asks.
