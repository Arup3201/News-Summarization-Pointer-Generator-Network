The former Tory Party candidate accused of having an affair with a married headmaster was seen yesterday for the first time since the story broke.

Keely Huxtable, 33, was reported to have been ‘found naked’ during school hours with Richard Tattersfield by his wife Janet.

Ms Huxtable was dubbed a ‘Cameron Cutie’ when she stood for election in 2010 as one of a dozen Conservative young female hopefuls.

But wearing a duffel coat outside the Birmingham house she used to share with husband Timothy, she looked far from her normal glamorous self.

Her husband has now moved out, while Mr Tattersfield, 45, is believed to have moved in.

Mrs Huxtable’s political hopes were dashed when she narrowly failed to capture the Northfield constituency she contested five years ago.

Last week she resigned as chairman of governors of Dame Elizabeth Cadbury Technology College in Bournville – where Mr Tattersfield is head – after the affair became public. Mrs Huxtable branded the claims as ‘rubbish’ and said she was the victim of a ‘witch hunt’.

The married head has now been suspended after his wife allegedly caught him sprinting from his bedroom in his boxer shorts with the naked Mrs Huxtable, who is the school's chair of governors, in his bed.

But Ms Huxtable - labelled a 'Cameron Cutie' after she became the youngest woman to be selected to stand for the Tories in the 2010 General Election -  branded the claims 'rubbish'.

She said the couple were fully clothed and 'working'.

She said: 'The school had been found to be weak around humanities and maths and we had to re-write the school's management plan, that's what we were doing.'

She added: 'She [Mrs Tattersfield] was there for five minutes, it is a load of rubbish.'

The alleged affair came to light after Mrs Tattersfield claimed she found the pair together in early December last year.

Mrs Huxtable's husband only found out about the incident when Mrs Tattersfield telephoned him to say that she had caught the pair in bed together  and that the affair had been going on since January last year.

Mrs Huxtable, pictured, had previously said her relationship with Mr Tattersfield 'was never about sex' 

He said his wife only admitted she had been sleeping with Mr Tattersfield after he confronted her in December.

He later discovered the pair had gone for a two-day luxury break at a hotel-spa over Valentine’s Day, claiming it was a ‘school conference’.

The couple say it is a 'witch-hunt' and they were working on 'strategic leadership planning' when confronted by Mr Tattersfield's wife, Jan.

Mrs Huxtable says that their relationship has 'never been about sex' and they became close because of a 'passion' for education. 

The headteacher was suspended on December 15 after Birmingham City Council launched an investigation into 'serious allegations'.

Married Mrs Huxtable, 33, resigned the following day as chairwoman of the governing body at the state school. 

Mrs Huxtable said: 'We only started a relationship properly after November, it's never been about sex.

'It's about two people with a shared massive passion for something [education] that have just got closer together.'

Probe: The headteacher is  suspended from duties at Dame Elizabeth Cadbury Technology College in Birmingham and Mrs Huxtable has resigned as chair of the governing body at the state school

Mrs Huxtable is not being investigated but it is understood  her relationship with the headteacher forms a significant part of the council probe.

It is understood the council investigation also relates to the management of resources and finances at the school. 

Sources claim the investigation includes an allegation the couple were found by the head's wife at a house he was renting after they separated.

It is claimed he was in his boxer shorts, while his chairwoman of governors was naked in bed.

The school was informed of the allegations the same day and the headmaster was suspended the following Monday. Mrs Huxtable quit her role as chair of the school governors the following day.

A Birmingham City Council spokesman said: 'On the basis of the seriousness of the allegations made, the head teacher was suspended in December, pending an investigation which is currently under way. The chair of governors also resigned in December.'

It is understood the school has received allegations that the headteacher had used the Cotteridge property to meet Mrs Huxtable on a number of Friday afternoons in November and December, during school hours.
