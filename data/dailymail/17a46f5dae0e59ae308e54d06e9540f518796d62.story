When a small business owner bought a storage container in a blind auction for $100 he hoped he might be able to double or even triple his money by selling its contents.

But inside he discovered one the world's most legendary film cars - and is now set to make at least 10,000 times what he paid for the container.

James Bond's Lotus Esprit submarine car, which featured in the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me, is going up for auction in London where it is expected to reach $1million.

Its owner, who has chosen to stay anonymous, found the car after buying the storage container in Long Island in 1989.

Movie star: The car was one of several Lotus Esprit's modified for use in The Spy Who Loved Me

Auction: Although the car has been exhibited before it is now up for sale for the first time where it is expected to reach $1million

It is believed the Lotus was left in storage by the production company which paid for the container for 10 years. But when the payment ran out and nobody came to collect it, it was put up for sale.

The man who bought it earns a 'very modest' living through his business which rents out construction tools.

He did not recognise the car, which is not roadworthy, for what it was as he had reportedly never seen a Bond film at the time.

When he pulled the covers off the car and found it had no wheels and a dented roof, he was less than thrilled with his buy.

But as he drove the car home on the back of a truck, other drivers who recognised the vehicle radioed him to tell him what it was, CNBC reported.

Back home he rented The Spy Who Loved Me on video, and realised how valuable his find was. 

The Lotus was nicknamed 'Wet Nellie' during filming and was built by a former Navy SEAL at a cost of around $100,000 - the equivalent to $500,000 today.

Although Roger Moore starred as Bond in the film, the submarine car was driven by retired Navy SEAL Don Griffin during underwater filming.

Specifications: James Bond's car was designed to convert into a submarine when underwater

There were actually several different Lotus Esprits used to film the sequence where Roger Moore and Barbara Bach escape the enemy by driving off a pier into the sea.

The car up for sale is the only one that worked as a self-propelled submarine.

Since its discovery the car has been exhibited from time to time but largely kept with its private owner.

Now it will go under the hammer at RM Auctions in London on September 9, after James Bond expert Doug Redenius tracked down its owner and confirmed the Lotus's authencity.

He told CNBC that he had told the owner to expect his fortunes to change 'dramatically'.

Rare find: The car is expected to reach $1million at auction in London next month

He said: 'I said "Come September 9th, be prepared for your life 
and your wife and your children—your life is going to change 
dramatically." And he said "well, how so" and I said "First of all, 
you're going to go down in history as the guy who found the James Bond 
car. But then if it sells for what we're hoping, that money will give 
you an opportunity to live very comfortably for the rest of your life."'

Max Girardo, managing director of RM Auctions Europe, said: 'Over the
years, millions of moviegoers have stared in awe as the Lotus 
transformed itself into a submarine, and now, perhaps one of them will 
have an opportunity to own it.'

The 1964 Aston Martin DB5 driven by Sean Connery in Goldfinger and Thunderball was sold by RM Auctions for $4.4million in 2010.
