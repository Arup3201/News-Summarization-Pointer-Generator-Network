Leicester captain Ed Slater is unlikely to play any part in England's autumn Test series after undergoing knee surgery.

The 26-year-old lock has been sidelined since captaining England's midweek side to a 38-7 victory over Super 15 outfit the Crusaders in New Zealand in June.

Leicester have ruled Slater out for 'several months', with England launching their autumn schedule by hosting New Zealand at Twickenham on November 8.

Slater would have been primed to battle Joe Lanchbury, Courtney Lawes and Dave Attwood for a second-row berth in head coach Stuart Lancaster's full England side.

'It's very disappointing for us and obviously for Ed because he was in such good form last season and has become an important member of our squad,' said Leicester rugby director Richard Cockerill.

'Ed's performances for Tigers have pushed his way into the England squad and I was very happy to be able to appoint him as Tigers club captain going into the new season.

'He is in good hands with our medical team, he's started his rehab from the surgery and we look forward to his return to training and playing in due course.'

Slater's injury absence to Leicester will be offset by the Tigers' summer recruitment of World Cup-winning former All Black Brad Thorn.

The evergreen 39-year-old was brought in to ease the loss of Steve Mafi, who has joined Australian Super Rugby franchise Western Force.
