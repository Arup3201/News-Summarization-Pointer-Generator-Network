South African President Jacob Zuma has been ordered to re-pay some of the 14million pounds tax payers money used for a lavish upgrade of his private home.

A damning report by the country’s top anti-corruption official described improvements at the residence used by Mr Zuma, his four wives and more than 20 children, as an 'unconscionable and excessive misappropriation of public funds'.

The report is the result of a two-year probe into a controversy which is largely responsible for a dramatic drop in the popularity of the 71 year old president, who was booed spontaneously by thousands of mourners at a memorial service for Nelson Mandela, in December. 

South Africa's public ombudsman said that non-security upgrades at President Jacob Zuma's private residence which cost the taxpayer $20 million were unlawful and he must repay part of the costs

The 400 page report by South Africa’s Public Protector concluded Mr Zuma had profited personally and acted 'unethically' during the process of upgrading his personal homestead, which saw neighbours being evicted to make way for facilities including a swimming pool, a visitors’ centre, helipads, football pitch and amphitheatre.

An earlier internal government probe into the renovations had found that the works were essential for the president’s security.

In plans, the swimming pool was described as 'a fire pool' required in the event of a blaze at the largely-thatched residence.

The report said that the president had inappropriately benefited from state funding but that he had done so by mistake, rather than intentionally violating the ethics code of his office

Yesterday’s eagerly-awaited report, entitled ‘Secure in Comfort’, established that while a personal clinic and house for police officers might reasonably form part of a security plan.

However, the amphitheatre, visitors’ centre and extensive new facilities for the Zuma family’s chickens and cattle could not. 

The scandal, known as ‘Nkandla’ after the nearest town to the sprawling property, has sparked massive resentment at the lifestyle enjoyed by the President and his extended family while millions of South Africans continue to live in poverty, despite the end of apartheid 20 years ago.

Mr Zuma is also no stranger to controversy, having faced rape and corruption charges before becoming president.

The country will go to the polls in a national election in May, which will be a further test of the popularity of Mr Zuma and the ruling African National Congress.
