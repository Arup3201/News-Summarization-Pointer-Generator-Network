Inquest: Alistair Bell who was shot dead by police officer after an armed seige where he shot and wounded a police officer

A gunman fired 34 bullets before he was fatally shot in the head by a police officer, an inquest has heard.

Three unarmed police officers went to the home of Alistair Bell, 42, in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, to arrest him when the man opened fire. One was wounded.

Firearms officers were then deployed to the address in the village of Kirkheaton as Mr Bell continued to fire shots out of windows.

He was gunned down at around 5am the following morning. He was taken to hospital and was pronounced dead shortly after arrival.

The jury heard the man fired a total of 34 shots throughout the night - meaning he must have reloaded four times.

Mr Bell was not licensed to own the pistol or a second unused firearm which was later recovered from the house.

The inquest heard a 'significant' amount 
of anabolic steroids was found in Mr Bell’s system on toxicological 
examination - with a small number of the population susceptible to 
'irrational' or 'aggressive' behaviour from heavy use.

The inquest at Bradford Crown Court is expected to continue for four weeks.

Outlining the case West Yorkshire Coroner Neil Cameron said: 'You will have to determine in what circumstances arising out of that incident the deceased came by his death.'

He said that police went to Mr Bell’s home on the evening of December 27 after a complaint made to them by a man who had a 'long-running dispute' with him.

Ian and Amanda Davidson, claimed Mr Bell had made threats of violence to them. Three unarmed officers were deployed.

Mr Davidson told police that it was a four-year disagreement between the former friends.

He said Mr Bell assaulted him with an axe on one occasion and he had a resulting scar to his head.

Mr Davidson claimed that threats had been made to his wife and children and he thought it was 'a real threat.' Mr Bell was said to have a known history of violence, jurors were told.

One male police constable 'cautiously' entered the house after Mr Bell opened and then shut his front door.

Mr Cameron said: 'Mr Bell was in the house. He opened the door briefly and then shut it again.

'One of the officers opened it and stepped in the house. He saw Alistair Bell inside holding a pistol and pointing at him.'

The officer told the 
inquest he was considering using his Taser but his 'blood ran cold' when
 he saw Mr Bell standing in the living room doorway with a gun pointed 
at him.

'I thought he was (either) going to shoot me now or I was getting out of here. He told me to ‘f*** off’, and I did.

'I ran out and shouted ‘Firearm, gun’ to one of my colleagues.'

Location: Police surround the West Yorkshire house of Bell shortly after the man was shot dead

He described 'a chaotic scene' as he heard gunshots which prompted officers to run from the house.

He later saw that a 
colleague, known as Pc A in the proceedings, had been shot and was 
sitting conscious on the ground near a bus shelter.

In a statement read out to the court, Pc A said he ran away from outside the house when his colleague shouted the gun warning.

He said he initially crouched behind a 4ft wall before he decided to run for better cover to a property facing opposite.

'I started to run and I heard a cracking sound. I felt something hit my back,' he said.

He managed to reach the opposite house where a female colleague confirmed he had been shot.

Scene: Bell  is said to have used this window to fire bullet at police officers

Pc A, who was wearing body armour, was treated for a wound near to his right shoulder blade.

He said he felt 'extremely lucky' that he did not receive more serious injuries.

Pc A said he did not see who fired the shot or the direction it came from.

Armed officers were then sent and surrounded the house, the coroner continued.

During the night Mr Bell fired a number of shots out of the window and he also made a number of phone calls and sent text messages to family members and friends, as well as a police negotiator.

The inquest heard Mr Bell eventually came downstairs and was shot by an officer who fired three rounds from a carbine.

One hit him in the crown of the head, which penetrated his brain, and another struck him to the left lower chest.

'The precise circumstances in which they were fired, what the officers saw and what Alistair Bell was doing, we shall hear about when the officers give evidence,' Mr Cameron said.

He added: 'Alistair Bell appeared to have fired a total of 34 shots from a pistol which meant he must have reloaded at least four times.

'Many of those appear to have been fired out of windows through curtains and blinds, or from positions where it was not possible to identify any specific targets.'

The only shots fired by the police were the three from the one officer, the jury was told.

The hearing continues tomorrow.
