A Georgia mother who claimed a group of armed robbers broke into her home, assaulted her autistic daughter and then 'stole Christmas' made up the elaborate tale, police said Thursday night.

Jordan Davis told authorities and even spun a story to the media that she and her disabled six-year-old daughter, Jade, were threatened, terrorized and robbed Wednesday night in their south DeKalb home.

But, after an extensive investigation Thursday, DeKalb County Police Capt. Steven Fore said there was no evidence to prove the crime ever happened and Davis later confessed to the hoax.

Hoax: Jordan Davis, pictured, claimed a group of armed robbers broke into her home, assaulted her autistic six-year-old daughter and then 'stole Christmas' but police said she made up the tale

'Evidence at the scene did not support the crime that allegedly took place,' Fore told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

'After speaking with her, (investigators) were able to determine that no one actually ever entered the residence and the child was never assaulted.'

Fore said Davis didn't reveal why she lied about the break in, though he suggested she may have been trying to take advantage of the generosity of the community around the holidays.

He said his office was bombarded with members of the community asking how they could help after the bandits apparently 'stole' the family's Christmas.

'We really don't have any definite motivation as to why she made up the story,' Fore said.

Husband: Jordan Davis and her husband, pictured, are expected to be charged in the hoax

'The outcry of support from the community has been overwhelming. This really, I would think, would hurt the good will of other people when they see stories like this.'

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also had an influx of readers asking how they could assist the family, the newspaper revealed.

Davis is being held at the DeKalb police headquarters as officials try to find a family member to care for her daughter.

The woman and her husband will be charged with crimes in the hoax.

Davis told police she and her autistic daughter were the victims of a group of thugs who broke into their home, beat up the child and then made off with all their Christmas presents.

She explained that the gang of masked men broke into her home by smashing through a dining room window with a cinder block about 7 pm -- just after her husband left to make a trip to the store.

Davis said she and Jade, who also suffers from epilepsy, were in an upstairs bedroom when the men stormed into their home.

'I heard a crash, and then I heard a boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,' 
Davis told WSBTV. 'It was the intruders coming up the stairs.'

As the men ransacked the house, Davis said her daughter - who is unable to speak - 'was of course crying.'

Davis said that at least one of the men had a gun and another had a knife during the attack, and that they forced her and the girl into a closet as they looked for valuables.

At one point, Davis said, one of the intruders kicked the young, disabled girl in the side and then 'picked her up by her hair and held a gun to her right temple and told me
to give them everything I have or he would kill her,' Davis said. 'It 
was real scary for everybody.

The armed thieves rummaged through the girl's room looking for valuables, Davis said, taking items including clothes, the girl's seizure medication and medical equipment the girl uses to communicate.Â 

Then, Davis said, they stole the family's Christmas presents and fled.

'They just stole Christmas from us,' Davis told Channel 2. 'It's sad.'

It was reported that Jade suffered bruised ribs in the attack and was examined at a local hospital before she was released Thursday. It's unclear how this occurred.
