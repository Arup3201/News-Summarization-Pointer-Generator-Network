Jenna Dewan Tatum has shared an inside look into her enviable life with husband Channing Tatum, once voted People's Sexiest Man Alive.

The 33-year-old actress, who is pretty in pink on the cover of Natural Health, is a mom to 13-month-old daughter Everly, and reveals one of the charming ways her husband pampers the mother of his first child.

'Chan and I will have a masseuse come to our house after the baby falls asleep,' she tells the publication. 'It’s awesome, and totally relaxing because Chan usually arranges it.'

Only yesterday, the couple were forced to release a joint statement on WhoSay addressing Star Magazine's recent report that their marriage was 'on the brink.'

'This is our world - where mags can concoct outright lies about real people in order to sell it to you as "journalism,"' it read. 'Hope we all think hard about what this means and start to demand better. I know we can. Love y'all.'

Mrs Dewan Tatum, an avid supporter of animal rights, also appears in a spread for the magazine; frolicking outside in a floral dress in one image, and clutching a large live chicken in another.

In a separate interview with The Humane Society earlier this month, she spoke of her passion for the welfare of animals, and how she incorporates it into her life.

'I definitely check to see if the treatments and products I use are humane,' she says. 'I also make it clear to wardrobe on any show or movie that I won’t wear fur.'

'I follow a clean vegetarian diet. That helps my skin out a lot, and I feel more energy as a result, too. Lots of green smoothies!'
