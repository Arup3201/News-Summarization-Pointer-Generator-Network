Roberto Mancini’s Inter Milan side crashed to a home defeat after Chelsea loan man Mohamed Salah sealed all three points for Fiorentina at the San Siro.

Both sides were in form and full of confidence after progressing to the Europa League round of 16 midweek, and Inter in particular after winning their past three league matches.

But they were undone in front of their own supporters thanks to the winger.

Salah scored the only goal of the game 10 minutes into the second half, following up after Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic fumbled at Manuel Pasqual's cross and only succeeded in parrying it straight to the feet of the Egypt international.

It was Salah's third goal in four Serie A matches since joining Fiorentina from the Blues, also netting against Tottenham Hotspur in midweek.

Inter, who had earlier hit the post through Fredy Guarin, went close to equalising on several occasions.

They weren’t able to make their numerical advantage count, however, after Fiorentina ended the game with nine men after Nenad Tomovic and Stefan Savic were both stretchered off with injuries.
