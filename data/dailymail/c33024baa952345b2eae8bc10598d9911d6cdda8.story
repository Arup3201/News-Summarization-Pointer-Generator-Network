A pair of Twitter trolls who threatened to kill and rape a feminist for campaigning to have Jane Austen on the £10 note were facing jail yesterday.

Isabella Sorley, 23, a binge-drinking college graduate, and John Nimmo, 25, a jobless recluse living on benefits, bombarded journalist Caroline Criado-Perez with vile messages threatening her with attacks ‘worse than rape’.

The threats started in July last year after the Bank of England revealed that the Pride And Prejudice author would replace Charles Darwin as the face of the £10 note.

John Nimmo (left), 25, and Isabella Sorley (right), 23, have admitted a charge of sending 'menacing' tweets to 29-year-old student Caroline Criado-Perez

The announcement was hailed as a 
‘brilliant day for women’ by Miss Criado-Perez, who had led a 
high-profile campaign on social media to ensure a female face would 
remain on banknotes after the Bank dropped social reformer Elizabeth Fry
 from the £5 note in favour of Winston Churchill.

But days later she began receiving a stream of abuse from 86 Twitter accounts.

Sorley,
 from Newcastle upon Tyne, has a degree in creative advertising from 
Leeds College of Art and is currently said to be working in an Asda 
supermarket in Newcastle.

But
 she deluged Miss Criado-Perez with menacing messages claiming that she 
had just been released from prison, writing: ‘I will find you and you 
don’t want to know what I will do when I do, you’re pathetic, kill 
yourself before I do.’

Other
 vile messages included: ‘I’ve only just got out of prison and would 
happily do more time to see you berried!!’ (sic) and ‘Rape?! I’d do a 
lot worse things than rape you!!’

Under the Malicious Communications Act 1988, any 'indecent or grossly offensive' message that causes 'distress or anxiety' to the recipient can lead to prosecution.

The maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than £2,500.

Since the 1988 law came into force before the widespread use of the internet, e-mail and social networking, prosecutors have used a number of different laws to charge Twitter trolls.

Student Liam Stacey, who sent a series of racially abusive tweets after footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed, was charged under the Crime and Disorder Act.

Two men jailed for inciting riots last summer were found guilty under the Serious Crime Act, and Paul Chambers, who joked he would blow Doncaster airport 'sky high' was charged under the Communications Act 2003.

Sorley later told police she was ‘bored’ and ‘off her face’ with drink at the time.

Defence counsel Sean Caulfield said Sorley had an alcohol problem and has 21 convictions for being drunk and disorderly.

She received a community order in December after assaulting a police officer and is currently on bail for four other offences.

Nimmo,
 from South Shields, also abused East London MP Stella Creasy when she 
tried to help Miss Criado-Perez, calling her a ‘dumb blonde bitch’.

The
 troll’s messages to Miss Criado-Perez included: ‘Ya not that gd 
looking. To rape u be fine,’ and: ‘Just think it could somebody that 
knows you personally. The police will do nothing its only twitter.’ 
(sic).

Westminster magistrates heard that Miss Criado-Perez had suffered ‘life-changing’ psychological effects from the abuse.

Prosecutor Alison Morgan said: ‘The messages involved extreme language and caused substantial distress and fear.’

Yesterday both defendants admitted sending by public communications network messages that were menacing in character.

District Judge Howard Riddle remanded Sorley in custody, warning she will ‘almost inevitably’ be sent to prison.

The banknote announcement was hailed as a 'brilliant day for women' by Ms Criado-Perez who led the high profile campaign

Nimmo was released on bail until January 24, when they will both be sentenced.

Following
 the hearing, Miss Criado-Perez said: ‘I hope this conviction will be a 
warning: online abuse is not consequence-free.’

Police are still investigating a number of other trolls.
