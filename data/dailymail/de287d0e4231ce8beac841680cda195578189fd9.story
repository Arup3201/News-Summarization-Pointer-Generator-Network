One lucky fan of the Clash will get to celebrate the birthday of their late lead singer Joe Strummer in roaring fashion - by becoming the new owner of his old classic car. 

The piece of rock 'n' roll history - his 1963 Chalfont Blue Ford Thunderbird - has appeared on eBay, and has already been bid on 70 times.

The price currently sits at $29,700, with the auction ending on Thursday - which would have been Strummer's 62nd birthday.

However, the price should rise steeply before it ends up in the hands of a lucky fan. 

The listing says Strummer initially purchased the California double black-plate Bullet body style T-bird for $4,200 in 1987.

According to sellers Beverly Hills Car Club, the car remains in pristine condition and spent several years in a climate-controlled garage.

'This is such a special car to me. I knew Joe Strummer as a boy growing up in London,' said Alex Manos, owner of the Beverly Hills Car Club. 'He was one of a kind, just like this car. Joe had an enormous love for American cars and I feel it's serendipitous that this beautiful 1963 Ford Thunderbird is coming to us for sale.'

The T-Bird was reportedly Strummer's preferred mode of transportation between his Los Angeles home and Baby O studios on Sunset Boulevard while he was recording his first official solo LP, Earthquake Weather.

While the car is in Beverly Hills, international and out-of-state buyers are welcome, and the Car Club will assist with shipping quotes and arrangements. 

The sky blue vehicle is a relic from Strummer's past, after the singer died from a heart condition in 2002

Strummer, born John Mellor, died from an undiagnosed congenital heart defect in 2002 after a career spanning 26 years.

He most famously spent ten years as The Clash's frontman and rhythm guitarist, releasing hits such as 'London Calling', 'White Riot' and 'Should I Stay Or Should I Go?'.

The explosive band were overtly political, singing about issues such as unemployment and racism, and were also notorious for getting in trouble with the law.

In 1977, he was arrested along with bandmate Nicky Headon for spray painting the band's name on a hotel room wall, and again in 1980 when he hit a member of the audience who was acting violently during a show in Hamburg, Germany.

After the failure of their 1985 album 'Cut the Crap', Strummer disbanded The Clash, and spent 13 years working on a solo career which also included appearances in films such as 'Sid and Nancy'.
