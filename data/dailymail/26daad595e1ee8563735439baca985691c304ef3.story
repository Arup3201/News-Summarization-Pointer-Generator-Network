Devastated: Leila Fowler was found stabbed to death in her California home last month

The 12-year-old brother of an eight-year-old girl stabbed to death at her California home has been charged with her murder.

The boy told police he found his sister Leila Fowler dead after an intruder broke into their home on April 27, sparking a 15-day manhunt in Valley Springs.

But Leila's brother, who has not been identified because he is a minor, has now been charged with second degree murder following his arrest on Friday.

Officers from the Calaveras County Sheriff's Office are yet to comment on the charges.

The 12-year-old is understood to be being held at a juvenile detention facility.

Attorneys Mark Reichel and Steve Plesser, from the firm representing the 12-year-old, have said he is doing 'as well as can be expected in these really difficult times', according to a report on abcnews.com.

They said they plan to ask the court to allow the boy to return to his family.

His father said earlier this week that he would believe his son was innocent until shown evidence to prove otherwise.

'Until they have proper evidence to show it's my son, we're standing behind him,' Barney Fowler said.

'If they have the evidence, well that's another story. We're an honest family,' he added.

The Fowler family had been due to provide a prepared statement to the media yesterday, but later cancelled the arrangement.

The unidentified boy has been charged with second degree murder with special circumstances for using a dangerous weapon in the crime.

The boy told investigators on April 
27 that he encountered a random attacker in the family home while his 
father was attending a Little League game. He described the man as tall 
with long gray hair.

The boy said the man fled on foot and he found his sister, Leila Fowler, bleeding.

Leila's death set off an intense manhunt in the rural community where some residents had moved to escape big city crime.

The Calaveras County Sheriff's Office spent more than 2,000 man-hours amassing evidence and searching door-to-door.

Residents
of the rural community began locking their doors and calling 
authorities when they thought they saw men who fit the description.

They also held fundraisers for the Fowler family and turned out by the thousands for a candlelight vigil in Leila's honor.

'We're thankful to the community and all they've done for my daughter,' Mr Fowler said.

He
echoed comments made earlier on Monday by his son, Justin Fowler, 19, 
who said the family was in shock and extremely sad about the boy's 
arrest.

Justin said the 
family is 'in a fog' over the boy's arrest that has rocked the 
community of Valley Springs.

The
arrested boy had appeared at a vigil for his sister on April 30, along with 
brother Justin, who was photographed with the name 'Leila' written on 
his forearm.

Aaron Plunk, a neighbor of the family, said the arrest was staggering but he could rest easier now.

He said he and his family had been extra vigilant about locking windows and doors, even though the street was being closely guarded by deputies.

‘I think we were the safest house in the county,’ Plunk told the Modesto Bee.

Calaveras Unified School District made counselors available on Monday at all schools.

Police released no information about 
what led them to arrest the unidentified 12-year-old for the April 27 
attack.

Following the crime, investigators did a door-to-door sweep of 
homes, storage sheds and horse stables scattered across the oak-studded foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Divers also searched two nearby 
reservoirs in search of clues.

Horrifying: Leila Fowler's 12-year-old brother was at their home with her in Valley Springs when he claimed he had encountered an intruder

Leila's brother told police he found 
his sister's body and encountered an intruder in the home while their 
parents were at a Little League game. He described the man as tall with 
long gray hair.

A neighbor told detectives she saw a man flee the home 
but she later recanted the story.

Police said there was no sign of a 
burglary or robbery. As part of the investigation, authorities seized 
several knives from the Fowler home, where Leila lived with her father, 
stepmother and siblings.

Calaveras County Sheriff Gary Kuntz 
said authorities spent more than 2,000 hours on the investigation before
they arrested the boy at 5:10 p.m. Saturday

Leila's brother was taken into custody at 5:10 p.m. Saturday and police hastily called a news conference to announce the arrest.

‘Citizens of Calaveras County, you can sleep a little better tonight,’ Kuntz said.

Authorities spent over 2,000 hours on
the investigation ‘to provide Leila Fowler's family answers to her 
death,’ the sheriff said.

Kuntz said at the time the investigation was ongoing. He declined to provide further details.

Several days after the killing, 
hundreds of people gathered at Jenny Lind Elementary School where Leila 
was a popular 3rd grader. Her mother, Krystal Walters, tearfully thanked
the crowd for the support.

The April 27 attack on Leila Fowler shook the tightknit Valley Springs community of about 7,400 people and set off a massive manhunt

‘I just want to thank the entire 
community and all of our family and friends for all the overwhelming 
amount of support you've given our family,’ Walters said at the time. 
‘It will never be forgotten. Thank you.’

Calaveras County Deputy Coroner Steve
Moore said the girl died from multiple stab wounds. They have not 
revealed how many times she was stabbed or where.

Violent crime is so rare in the 
community of 7,400 people that even law enforcement officers have to 
stop and think when asked about the last time there was a stranger 
killing in the area.

'Probably five years ago was the last one I can remember,' said Officer 
Rebecca Myers of the California Highway Patrol, who was assigned to 
block access to the neighborhood of one-acre ranchettes.
