Amazon has accidentally revealed a 7-inch tablet made by Acer and poised to take on Apple's iPad mini.

The Acer Iconia W3 - which appeared briefly on amazon.com before being removed  - is the first small tablet seen running Microsoft's Windows 8 software.

Microsoft is also believed to be developing its own tablet, based on the larger Surface, which is to be unveiled next month at the firm's Build developer conference.

Acer's W3 tablet: The Amazon listing said the W3 would cost $379.99 for the 32GB model, and come with a dual-core Intel Atom 
processors to do battle with Apple's iPad mini

The listing was quickly removed from amazon's US site

The listing said the W3 would cost $379.99 for the 32GB model, and come with a dual-core Intel Atom processor.

It will launch with a screen resolution of 1280 x 800, although there was no date specified on the listing.

Earlier this month French site minimachines.net revealed more pictures of the gadget, which is set to come with a keyboard addon turning it onto a laptop.

Microsoft is rumoured to be announcing its two small-screen Surface tablets at the Build Developers Conference in June.

According to French site minimachines.net the gadget will come with a keyboard add on to turn it into a mini laptop

One of these is expected to be its own -  a smaller version of its Surface tablet with a 7inch screen.

The tablets are expected to go on sale later this year, and will go head to head with Apple's iPad Mini, Google's Nexus 7 and the Amazon Kindle Fire in the lucrative small tablet market.

It is hoped the devices could reverse the disappointing sales of the larger Surface tablet which Microsoft launched this year.

The Surface tablet was unveiled earlier this year to a lukewarm reception - Now Microsoft is believed to be developing a smaller version to take on Apple's iPad mini

Samsung's new Galaxy Mega has a 6.3-inch HD screen - although the firm claims it is 'ultra-thin and portable enough to put into your pocket.'

The Mega comes with an enhanced 8 megapixel rear-facing camera with a 1.9 megapixel front-facing camera, and runs Google Android software.

'The software giant is developing a new lineup of its Surface tablets, including a 7-inch version expected to go into mass production later this year,', The Wall Street Journal said people familiar with the company's plans had claimed.

It claims the 7-inch tablets weren't part of the company's strategy last
year, but Microsoft executives realized they needed a response to the 
rapidly growing popularity of smaller tablets like Google 7-inch Nexus, 
which was announced last summer, and the 7.9-inch iPad Mini introduced 
by Apple last October, along with Amazon's Fire HD.

Separate reports have speculated the new tablet could be designed primarily as a games and media device, and be branded as an 'Xbox tablet' to accompany Microsoft's hugely successful games console.

It comes amid growing concern for the future of the PC industry as consumers move towards tablets.

PC sales have have gone into freefall with a 14 per cent drop last year - the biggest slump in history.

HP, the world's largest PC maker, saw the sharpest decline with 24 per cent fewer machines sold in 2012 compared to 2011.

Dell also saw an 11 per cent slump and even Apple, which saw a seven per cent fall, was unable to buck the trend.

Research firm IDC said it was the biggest decline overall since it began began tracking this data in 1994.

Analysts
said that ‘the days seem to be numbered for the humble PC’ and that in 
the future we would all be using portable devices.

Even
the launch of Windows 8 failed to stop the trend with some saying the 
negative response to the software may have exacerbated the trend.

PC
makers have in recent years tried a string of innovations to breathe 
life into the market including Ultrabooks which were poorly received.

How the competition stacks up

Experts say the success of the iPad and smartphone has led to the slump in PC sales, with people preferring gadgets they can carry with them

Windows 8 was also criticised for making too many changes and getting rid of the iconic start button.

The figures show that the late Apple founder Steve Jobs’ prediction that we are headed for a ‘post-PC era’ is coming true.

Bob
O’Donnell, program vice president for clients and displays at IDC, said
that what he called the ‘radical changes’ made to the PC in recent 
years had done it more harm than good.

He
said: ‘At this point, unfortunately, it seems clear that the Windows 8 
launch not only failed to provide a positive boost to the PC market, but
appears to have slowed the market.

‘Microsoft will have to make some very tough decisions moving forward if it wants to help reinvigorate the PC market’.

Microsoft also came under fire for the slump, with critics saying its Windows 8 software confused users

Some 350 million personal computers are sold each year, but the numbers are nothing compared to more portable options.

Some 919 million smartphones will be sold this year and 200 million tablets, taking their total comfortably over one billion.

Research firm Gartner also released similar figures which showed a 11 per cent decline in PC sales, the biggest drop since 2001.

The company has already predicted that by 2017 the main operating system for all computing devices will be Google’s Android.

Marcus Jewell of tech company Brocade said: ‘The days seem to be numbered for the humble PC’.
