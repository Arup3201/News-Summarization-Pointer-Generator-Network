British No 3 Naomi Broady fell at the first hurdle in qualifying for the Australian Open, losing in straight sets to Poland's Urszula Radwanska on Thursday.

Broady lost 6-4, 6-3 in breezy, overcast conditions in Melbourne to leave Johanna Konta as the only player able to join British No 1 Heather Watson in the main draw.

Watched by Fed Cup captain Judy Murray, Broady recovered from an early break of serve in the opening set to lead 3-2, but then lost her serve for a second time in the seventh game and Radwanska served out for the set with ease.

Poland's Urszula Radwanska comfortably saw off Broady 6-4, 6-3  on Thursday

A double fault from Broady gifted Radwanksa an early break in the second set and the world number 149 saved two break points in the eighth game to move within sight of victory.

That seemed to break Broady's spirit and the 24-year-old committed four unforced errors in the next game - including two double faults - to hand her opponent a second break and the match.

Konta also lost in straights to American Ann Tatishvili in a match featuring eight breaks of serve and complaints from both players about the standard of officiating.

The players swapped breaks of serve in the first two games of the match and Konta saved a total of five break points before gifting Tatishvili a 5-4 lead with a double fault.

Tatishvili served out to take the set 6-4 but Konta battled back in the second and was twice a break up, only to love her serve immediately both times. On the second occasion the world number 147 served three double faults and told umpire Jose Sierra 'We need to change you' after a crucial overrule.

Another debatable line call prompted Konta to tell Sierra 'You're shocking, you know that?' as she lost her serve once more in the 11th game and Tatishvili gratefully grabbed her chance to secure a 6-4 7-5 win.
