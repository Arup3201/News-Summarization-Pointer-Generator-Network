With the impressive Manhattan skyline as his backdrop, Jack Wilshere is stood reflecting on his previous visit to America.

Of course, we all know what happened the last time Wilshere was in the States. Las Vegas. Pool party. Smoking. Drinking. The infamous photographs from Wilshere’s boys’ trip to Sin City tells its own story.

And speaking publicly for the first time since those unsightly snaps emerged, Wilshere is hugely repentant. ‘Of course, I regret it,’ said the Arsenal midfielder. ‘I’ve been seen doing it before, I said then I made a mistake and I made a mistake again.

New leaf: Jack Wilshere says he will learn from his mistakes ahead of Arsenal's new season

Shame: Jack Wilshere was pictured smoking and drinking during a boy's trip to Las Vegas

‘People make mistakes. I’m young, I’ll
 learn from it. I realise the consequences it has and the effect on kids
 growing up. I have kids myself and I don’t want them growing up to 
think their dad smokes and it’s OK for a footballer to smoke because 
it’s not. It’s unacceptable and I will accept the consequences and I 
will move on.’

We have heard
 it all before, though. When caught smoking outside a  London nightclub 
in October, just days before a Premier League clash against West Brom, 
Wilshere was again apologetic.

At
 the time, he insisted he was not a smoker and that there would be no 
repeat of the episode. Nine months later, Wilshere is in the same boat, 
making the same mistake, making the same apology.

However,
 there is a sincerity about the 22-year-old this time — a sense that he 
truly has learned his lesson. Time, of course, will prove whether his 
latest remorseful pleas are as empty as the ones he made last year. But 
he is certainly going the right way about righting the wrongs of his 
trip to Vegas.

Wilshere 
returned to pre-season training four days earlier than planned and — 
ahead of Saturday night’s friendly against New York Red Bulls — he has been 
at the forefront of the Arsenal’s promotional campaign as they look to 
tap into the USA’s vast earning potential.

Of course, a couple of drags 
on a cigarette and a few glasses of champagne are unlikely to have a 
huge effect on Wilshere’s fitness. But it is the fact he has put himself
 in that position yet again that has infuriated manager Arsene Wenger, 
who is a staunch anti-smoker.

‘This
 whole thing does motivate me to try harder in training. It motivates me
 to improve because a lot of  people start to talk about me —  people 
who don’t know me but want to have an opinion and it is down to me to 
let my feet do the talking,’ said Wilshere. ‘I came back early to show 
people my commitment. I don’t like to talk about to it too much, but 
this is a big season for me.’

Stalled: Jack Wilshere is no longer guaranteed a starting place in Arsenal's first XI

Enter the dragon: Aaron Ramsey (L) has established himself as Arsenal's first choice central midfielder

Indeed.
 This is perhaps the biggest season of Wilshere’s fledgling career. Once
 hailed as the leader of  Arsenal’s next generation, the  England 
international’s career has stuttered over the past 18 months.

And
 with Aaron Ramsey now established as the club’s premier central 
midfielder, Wilshere is no longer a certain starter for Wenger.

Injuries
 have not helped Wilshere’s cause. But he is also honest enough to admit
 that he must start shifting through the gears if he is to fulfil his 
undoubted potential.

The 
£30million capture of Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona will make it even 
harder for Wilshere to secure a regular spot in the team next season.

He
 insists, however, that the club’s new talent — including France 
right-back Mathieu Debuchy — will only serve to make the team and 
himself stronger.

‘I think 
over the past few seasons I’ve had a few injuries. I’ve got going, had 
to stop and get going again,’ said Wilshere. ‘This season I’m looking to
 have a really great pre-season and get a really good base of fitness 
and take that into the season.

‘The
 new signings will definitely give us a lift. It has been different this
 summer. This year we’ve been really positive and gone into the  market 
and got a couple of really great players. We’ve got to really try to 
take that into the later stages of the season and be a bit more mature 
and maybe we can last the pace.’

A tad more maturity from Wilshere and he will certainly last the pace.
