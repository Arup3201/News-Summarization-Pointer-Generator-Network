A Minnesota teen paralyzed during a high school hockey game became the latest to take a celebrity to the prom when he showed up with ESPN’s Michelle Beadle.

Jack Jablonski, a senior at Benilde-St Margaret’s High School in Minneaoplis, asked the popular host of 'Sports Nation' to his prom during a recent radio interview – she said yes.

Jablonski was paralyzed three years ago when a player hit him into the boards behind the goal from behind, according to his personal website.

Beadle, 38, and Jablonski were both being interviewed by a local radio station last month when he asked her to the big dance.

She agreed to be his date and flew into Minneapolis the night before to have dinner with his family, according to WCCO.

The host spent her time in Minneapolis posting pictures of her and her date online.

‘I’m happy that the school actually allowed me because I know they’re very, they’ve got some really good rules here,’ she told the station.

Footage of the pair showed both laughing and enjoying the evening.

‘It’ll be fun. I get to go on a school bus. Hello, it’s going to make me young again,’ she added.

Beadle admitted being nervous for the prom but seemed at ease.

She also gave a high schooler a night he’ll never forget.
