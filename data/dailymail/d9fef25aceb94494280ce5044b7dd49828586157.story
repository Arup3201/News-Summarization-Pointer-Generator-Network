Real Madrid president Florentino Perez has defended his club's transfer policy after Cristiano Ronaldo spoke out about Angel di Maria's  £60million move to Manchester United.

The European champions also got rid of former Spain midfielder Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich for just £5m, much to the disappointment of Ronaldo, who openly criticised Perez's decisions.

But the Real president insisted there was no feud, saying: 'I know Cristiano Ronaldo very well. Cristiano is the best player in the world and his loyalty to Madrid is unquestionable.

‘If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,' Ronaldo said about Real's summer transfers.

'I have a very clear opinion but I can’t always say what I think.'

'I have listened to all the comments he made and as I know him, I know that he never questioned the club. My relationship with him is perfect, there are zero discrepancies. Cristiano is the best player in the world, it's obvious, and more so this year.'

Perez revealed Di Maria left Real no option but to sell him after the Argentina midfielder turned down an improved contract that would have made him the second-best paid player at the club.

'I've been here since 2000,' Perez continued. 'Since then a lot of players have come and gone and my experience tells me that the ones that leave are always the best and those that arrive are always questioned.

'My first (signing) was (Zinedine) Zidane and the last (before this summer's transfer window) was (Gareth) Bale. We made the best offer that we could to Di Maria and he didn't accept it.

'Hence, we brought in James (Rodriguez), one of the best players at the World Cup and the Golden Boot award winner. Di Maria and all of those that have left have our gratitude and respect.

'A player that is under contract and leaves is because he wants to. Real has always respected contracts. Di Maria had financial requests that I considered legitimate but we couldn't satisfy them. I reiterate that we made him the best possible offer.

'With the exception of Cristiano, Di Maria would have been the highest paid at Real Madrid. Had we accepted his financial demands it would have created an unbalanced treatment that would have put the club's stability in danger.

'Di Maria left to Manchester for a fee that we considered fair and that is why the transfer was completed. We wish Di Maria the best professionally and personally.'

Perez also spoke of Alonso's unexpected move to Bayern  on a two-year deal.

'Xabi came to us and told us that he wanted to leave,' he said. 'He thought it was the best for him and for the club. Our relationship with Xabi is excellent and we accepted his proposal.

And Carlo Ancelotti's decision to not sign Radamel Falcao had a heavy influence on Perez, who admits Real considered signing the Monaco striker before his one-year loan deal with United. 

'We considered signing Falcao,' Perez said. 'But in this club we follow a sporting-economic equation which (former club president Santiago) Bernabeu taught us, and we decided not to do so.

'The coach's opinion was also important in us turning it down.'
