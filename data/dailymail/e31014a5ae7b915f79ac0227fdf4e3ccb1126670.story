A desperate mom who posted an appeal for a kidney donor in the rear window of her car has found a donor after a stranger saw the message and offered to help.

Christine Royles was 23 when she learned she had two autoimmune diseases, lupus and ANCA vasculitis, leading to kidney failure, the Portland Press Herald reported.

The South Portland woman went on the national waiting to find a donor, but chose to go a different route, according to the newspaper.

Plea: Royles wrote this message on the back of her car looking for for assistance

Needing help: Christine Royles, seen left with her fiance Dominick Morrilly and right with her son Talan, scribbled a want ad for a kidney on her back windshield after going on the national waiting list for a donor

The Portland Press Herald reported that Royles painted an appeal for a donor on the rear window of her car, along with a phone number.

The message read 'Looking for someone 2 donate me their kidney! Must have type O blood :) (you only need one kidney.)' 

Josh Dall-Leighton, 30, saw the message on a trip to the Maine Mall with his family, according to the newspaper. 

The father-of-three, who works as a corrections officer, called.

He told the Portland Press Herald 'I just looked at my wife and said, "I have to try." I think it was the fact that I have three kids of my own, and that really resonated with me. 

'If (my wife) needed a kidney and I couldn't provide for her, I would hope that somebody else would kind of step up and help her out.' 

Meeting for the first time: Christine Royles and Talan met Josh Dall-Leighton and his son Christopher last Tuesday 

Treatment: Royles posted a photograph to Facebook showing her two-month dialysis supply. She reportedly spends 10 hours on a dialysis machine when she gets home from work

The Windham stranger has been classified as a potential match and the surgery is set for May, according to the newspaper.

Royles, 24, told the Portland Press Herald:  'The fact that someone with a young family is going to take time off work to help some random person is unbelievable to me.'

The newspaper reported that Royles spends 10 hours on a dialysis machine upon returning from her Applebee's job.

WGME reported that the South Portland Applebee's will host a fundraising pancake breakfast on behalf of Dall-Leighton next month. A GoFundMe page is also seeking donations.

The GoFundMe page says 'Two of his sons are twins that were born at 29 weeks in 2014. They need a lot of care and have special needs.' 

Royles explained to WGME 'He's going to be out of work for a month or maybe two months, so I just wanted to make sure he has a bit of money for his family.'

Family: Ashley Dall-Leighton and her husband Josh-Dall Leighton are seen with two of their three sons, Christopher and Mason 

Embrace: Josh Dall-Leighton, Christine Royles, and young Christopher are seen together
