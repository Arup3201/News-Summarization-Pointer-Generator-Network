People living in the port city where a U.S. ship is docked ahead of its mission to destroy Syrian chemical weapons say they are worried about potentially dangerous leaks.

Residents of the town next to the southern Italian port of Gioia Tauro say they have been kept in the dark about the chemical weapons being shipped in.

Despite official reassurances, they fear the potential impact that any leaks may have on their health or the environment and accuse the government of lumbering them with the consignment.

Mayor of San Ferdinando Domenico Madafferi: He said local people had been kept in the dark over the hundreds of tons of chemical weapons being transported to their city from Syria to be decomissioned

The MV Cape Ray arrived in Gioia 
Tauro today for the unprecedented transfer and destruction of about 
1,300 tons of Syrian chemical weapons.

The
 648ft U.S. government cargo ship has been fitted with two machines 
designed to neutralize the most toxic chemicals, including mustard gas 
and the raw materials for sarin nerve gas.

The chemicals were handed over by the Syrian government as part of a deal with the international community to destroy its chemical weapons.

The most dangerous chemical weapons will be transferred from the Danish vessel Ark Futura to the Cape Ray, which will move into international waters for the destruction.

Other material will be taken to toxic wastes sites in various countries for disposal.

But on the eve of the ship's arrival, residents and officials from Gioia Tauro and nearby towns voiced concern about potential environmental contamination as a result of the transfer.

They also complained that they hadn't been told what exactly would be taking place near their homes.

'We live this situation with uncertainty and resignation because for the last four months we continued to ask for information about it but they didn't give it,' said Domenico Madafferi, mayor of the nearby town of San Ferdinando.

He told Italian paper La Stampa: 'People are fed up and it’s not true that they support it.

'We’re not even sure about the materials being transported…Some people speak about the lethal impact of iprite [mustard gas] and sarin, others are even claiming that the entire load of weapons is ready for use.'

He accused the Italian government of 'making it rain on the heads' of people on Calabria, which is one of the country's poorest regions.

While the disarmament process is risky from beginning to end, those in charge have insisted that equally hazardous chemicals are neutralised on a daily basis around the world.

But the claims are scant reassurance to residents aware that Albania, Norway, Belgium and France had all refused to host the stockpile before their own government accepted it.

Destroying chemical weapons at sea is unprecedented, but U.S. officials told the Associated Press that the process is a proven, safe way to neutralise toxic chemicals.

The officials said no vapour or water runoff will be released into the atmosphere or sea as a result.

Mission: The US cargo ship MV Cape Ray after it arrived docked at Gioia Tauro early this morning

Bolted into the Cape Ray's cavernous cargo hold are two machines called Field Deployable Hydrolysis Systems.

They consist of mazes of tanks, tubes, cables and electronics that will mix the Syrian chemicals with heated water and a cocktail of other chemicals in a titanium reactor to render them inert.

More than 60 experts needed to operate chemical destruction machinery, as well as security and support staff, are expected to be on board to oversee the process.

The operation marks the first time the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has overseen the destruction of a chemical weapon stockpile in the midst of a raging civil war.
