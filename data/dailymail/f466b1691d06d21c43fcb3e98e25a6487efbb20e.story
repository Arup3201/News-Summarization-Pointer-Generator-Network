Russian police are seeking to arrest two more alleged members of the female Pussy Riot punk group who eluded them in the controversial cathedral protest against Vladimir Putin.

‘The criminal case is ongoing and a search is under way,’ disclosed a spokesman for the Interior Ministry yesterday. 

The move to open a new front against the balaclava-clad group - which has brought international outrage against Putin - came as chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov also faced questioning on a police claim that he 'bit' an officer arresting him.

But in another development a top member of Putin's government yesterday gave the strongest hint that the two year sentences for hooliganism aimed at inciting religious hatred for Yekaterina Samutsevich, 30, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 22, and Maria Alyokhina, 24, could be reduced on appeal.

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, one of Russia's most respected figures in international circles, blasted Western criticism of Russia for their ‘tantrum’ over the case, but gave the clearest indication yet that the three women could be released early.

'Hysterical' reaction: Lavrov said protestors should not interfere with the verdict which could see the women serve two years in a prison colony

‘You may personally agree or disagree with the verdict. But it is unacceptable to interfere with the court,’ he said in Helsinki.

Working on appeal: After Miss Tolokonnikova was sentenced with the other members, their lawyer began preparing an appeal

Warned against 'hasty conclusions and hysterical reaction', he said: ‘There is always the appeals option.’

With the group's lawyer's now working on an appeal, Lavrov stressed Putin had recommended leniency for the group members during his London visit for the Olympics. 

‘A similar stance was taken by the Russian Orthodox Church,’ he emphasised.

His statement ahead of an expected appeal is the most decisive statement from a top member of the Russian government since the women were jailed. 

But Alexei Navalny, a whistle-blowing anti-corruption campaigner who is emerging as the opposition's most prominent figure, warned yesterday: ‘Putin has decided to put all his opponents behind bars.’

He urged: ‘We have to take to the streets in great numbers. Foreign countries should impose sanctions against Putin's corrupt network. But we'll probably wait in vain for that to happen.’

He claimed the Pussy Riot case highlighted the seriousness of the problem faced by Putin foes. 

‘When men are arrested without any legal basis and for political reasons, it's merely a routine, everyday occurrence in Russia, and hardly anyone has any sympathy,’ said Navalny who is facing charges which could jail him for a decade. 

‘But until recently, everyone deluded themselves into thinking that the Kremlin wouldn't dare put women behind bars. The women from Pussy Riot have also become symbols partly because this cliche has been shattered.’
