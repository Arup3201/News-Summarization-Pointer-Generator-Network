New pictures of paedophile DJ Jimmy Savile surrounded by vulnerable children have fuelled rumours he chose to be buried in a particular spot because it overlooks three schools.

The late TV host is seen with dozens of pupils from Woodlands Special School in Scarborough 45 years ago, which still stands just below Woodlands Cemetery, his final resting place.

The Top Of The Pops presenter's final wish was to 'see' the sea when he died, but the 45 degree angle he is buried at also allows his body to face the mixed-sex Graham School in Scarborough, which teaches pupils from between the ages of 11 and 16.

However, there have been no allegations that the alleged sexual predator targeted any past or present pupils at the Graham School or the Woodlands Special School.

Savile is accused of abusing more than 120 people, including children, over a 50 year period.

It came just a week after Savile was left in an 
unmarked grave after a dead-of-night operation to remove his £4,000 
headstone at the request of his family.

young schoolgirls from Woodlands Special School, Scarborough, taken in 
July 1967. There is no suggestion any of these children were abused

Claims: Savile pictured with Woodlands students, also in July 1967 and his grave looks down onto this school

Undertakers
 worked in the dark to rip out the giant memorial and have said it would 
'be broken up, placed in a skip and used as landfill'.

Meanwhile,
 more black and white photos emerged today showing a little more about 
the life he led in Scarborough, where he lived and died.

Savile is shown running and cycling around various areas of the town, often in bizarre poses.

Mr Johnson, now aged 67 years, was among family members who decided to remove the headstone from the former Radio 1 star's grave after the allegations of sex abuse came to light

There are also pictures of him in his flat with his mother Agnes, who he called the Duchess.

Meanwhile Gary Glitter was spotted for the first time since the Jimmy Savile scandal broke.

Convicted paedophile Glitter raped a girl of 13 in Sir Jimmy Savile’s BBC dressing room, it was claimed.

The attack in the 1970s allegedly took place as Savile was himself groping a 14-year-old in the same room.

Spotted: Paedophile Gary Glitter arrives back at his London home today - the first time he has been seen since he has been linked to sexual abuse allegations with Jimmy Saville

Last week the gates of Woodlands Cemetery were 
locked at around 11pm and police stood guard for the two-hour
 operation to remove Savile's Scarborough grave.

His 
loved-ones did not attend and while they had ordered the removal of the 
grave they were not aware of the undertakers’ decision to do it in the 
middle of the night.

They
 were to wait until 7am before removing the six foot wide by four 
foot tall  headstone with Savile’s now inflammatory epitaph: 'It was 
good while it lasted.'

All its inscriptions will be ground away before the stone is destroyed.

Below
 it is Savile's body, encased in concrete at a 45 degree angle, so he 
could 'see' the sea and Scarborough castle - his dying wish.

The Savile family said in a statement: 'Members of the family of Sir
Jimmy Savile have decided to remove his headstone from the grave in 
Scarborough.

'The family members are deeply aware of the impact that the stone 
remaining there could have on the dignity and sanctity of the cemetery.

'Out of respect to public opinion, to those who are buried there, and to
those who tend their graves and visit there, we have decided to remove 
it.'

The Savile family feared the grave could
 become the centre of a media circus and could have been attacked and 
gave funeral director Robert Morphet a free hand to carry out what he 
called 'a discreet' operation.

Veteran broadcaster Mike Harding has launched an astonishing attack on BBC bosses after he was sacked from his Radio 2 folk show over the phone.

The Manchester musician and funnyman, who scored an unlikely hit with The Rochdale Cowboy, was given the bullet from his weekly programme after 15 years.

Mike, right, said: 'Jimmy Savile interfered with kids on the BBC's premises and got away with it. Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand joked about having sex with Andrew Sachs' grandaughter on the BBC and got away with it.

'I present a folk show for 15 years, build the audience from 70,000 to 860,000, and get the sack - and it's me that's supposed to be the comedian."

Mike, 67, will make way for Manchester City fanatic Mark Radcliffe.

He added: 'I got a two-minute phone call from the controller of Radio 2 [Bob Shennan] which is the first time I have heard from the bosses in 15 years

'I'm in the dark and have no idea why they have done it. You get sacked from the BBC for two reasons. One, financial - and it can't be that because I've not had a rise in 15 years. And two, declining audience figures - and mine haven't. They have sold the folk world down the river.'

Mike, who lives in Manchester city centre, said Mr Shennan had refused to go into details about reasons behind the decision.

He said: 'He [Mr Shennan] said I wasn't "live" - I wasn't aware I was dead. I am not bitter I just don't understand it. It's a specialist folk music show and I am a specialist in folk music.'

Mr Shennan said: 'I'd like to thank Mike Harding, who has spent 15 years at the top of his game, delighting fans with his expertise and rooting out the very best folk music. On his watch, folk has enjoyed a huge surge in popularity and Mike has been key in supporting the genre and introducing Radio 2 listeners to a broad range of new artists. We very much hope to work with him again in the future.'
