Putting on weight has a damaging effect on the heart - even if you are not overweight, new research suggests.

For every five units of body mass index (BMI) increase in women, the risk of heart disease increases by 23 per cent - the equivalent of ageing two and a half years.

The University of Oxford researchers found that the chance of coronary heart disease (CHD) increase not just with age, but with BMI too, with a rise in weight carrying the same risks as getting older.

The findings held true even in women not considered obese, with small increases in BMI all contributing to the increased risk, the study found.

BMI is a height to weight ratio, measured in units. The WHO gives a 'normal' rating to a BMI of between 18.5 and 25.

The researchers followed the health of 1.2 million women in England and Scotland for more than a decade.

The findings, published in journal BMC Medicine, showed that the occurrence of CHD went up by 23 per cent for each five unit increase in BMI.

This was the equivalent to ageing two and a half years.

One in eleven lean middle aged women - with an average BMI of 21 - will be admitted to hospital or will have died from CHD between the ages of 55 to 74. 

But this risk progressively increases with BMI, and it reaches one in six, for obese women, with an average BMI of 34.

Study author Dr Dexter Canoy said: 'The risk of developing CHD increases even with small incremental increases in BMI, and this is seen not only in the heaviest but also in women who are not usually considered obese.

'Small changes in BMI, together with leading a healthy lifestyle by not smoking, avoiding excess alcohol consumption, and being physically active could potentially prevent the occurrence of CHD for a large number of people in the population.'

Other recent research found that office workers could be risking their health simply by sitting at their desk for hours at a time.

It found people who spend more than four
 hours a day sitting down are at greater risk of chronic illnesses such 
as cancer, diabetes and heart disease.

Those sitting for at least six hours were significantly more likely to have diabetes.

The research involved 63,048 middle-aged men but US scientists say the findings are likely to also apply to women.

Professor Richard Rosenkranz, who led the study at Kansas State University, said the more people sat, the bigger the health problems.

He said ‘We saw a steady stair-step increase in risk of chronic diseases the more participants sat.

‘The group sitting more than eight hours clearly had the highest risk.’ The latest study follows research last year on 222,000 people which found sitting down too long increases your risk of dying within three years, even among the physically active.
