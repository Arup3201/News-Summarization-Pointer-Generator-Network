WBA and WBO light welterweight champion Danny Garcia ensured he'd make the headlines after knocking out Rod Salka in devastating fashion in the second round of their non-sanctioned fight in Brooklyn on Saturday.

The American made light work of Salka with the latter forced to retire after a stunning left hook knocked him out cold.

The decision not to sanction the fight by either the WBA or WBO was vindicated, with Salka - usually a lightweight fighter - looking well out of his depth.

It only took Garcia two rounds to finish the job as he twice knocked his fellow American to the floor before the crucial intervention.

After the fight Garcia said: 'I came here to purge. I told everybody tonight was going to be the Danny Garcia show. No matter who I fought tonight they were going to get beat. I was going to purge.

Trainer Angel Garcia echoed his fighter's views adding: 'He did what he was supposed to do. Salka came here to fight. But that's what Danny's supposed to do with these kinds of guys. I'm not talking about Salka. I'm talking about anyone.'
