Hull manager Steve Bruce kept his counsel over whether summer signings Robert Snodgrass and Tom Ince would make their full debuts in Thursday's Europa League third-round qualifier against AS Trencin.

The attacking midfielders, recruited from Norwich and Blackpool respectively, ran out for the Tigers for the first time as substitutes towards the end of last week's goalless first-leg draw in Slovakia.

Bruce has no injury concerns after winger Robbie Brady recovered from tonsillitis, but recently-recruited defenders Andrew Robertson and Harry Maguire are not eligible.

New boy: Tom Ince could be in line for his full debut as Hull attempt to get past AS Trencin

Firepower: Robert Snodgrass has been brought in to add incision to the Hull attack this season

McGregor, Harper, Jakupovic, Rosenior, 
Dudgeon, Meyler, Davies, Elmohamady, Chester, McShane, Boyd, 
Huddlestone, Long, Sagbo, Snodgrass, Quinn, Livermore, Aluko, Brady, 
Jelavic.

Honduran centre-back Maynor Figueroa has been permitted to take an extended holiday following the World Cup.

The Tigers were unable to secure a first leg lead after Tom Huddlestone missed a penalty before blazing the rebound over the bar in Slovakia.

However, Bruce's side are favourites to progress to the Europa League play-off round where they could be drawn against the likes of Inter Milan on Villarreal.

Disaster: Tom Huddlestone missed a penalty and then blasted over the rebound in Slovakia

Preparing: Bruce has kept his cards close to his chest as he decides whether to start his new signings
