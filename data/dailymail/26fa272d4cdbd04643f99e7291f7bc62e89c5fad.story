Victoria's Secret sales associates have been accused of plus-size and age discrimination by disappointed and dejected customers.

After a redditor wrote an open letter addressed to Victoria’s Secret, accusing its staff of sending plus-size women to Lane Bryant for bras despite sizes going up to 40DDD, other customers have come forward to share their disappointment in the lingerie retailer.

'I am plus-sized and came in looking for some lingerie for a special occasion and the seventeen-year-old, size three sales associate, while looking down her nose at me, told me that I'd be better off going to Lane Bryant and that her store had nothing for me,' commented Sara Crow on Styleite.

Another women admitted that this happened to her twice, at two different stores in different states.

'I don't go in there anymore even though I know they have my size,' wrote Humorless Feminist.

'I am tired of the world being full if presumptuous jerks who think that because they like a particular aesthetic they're entitled to treat people who fall outside of it with disrespect.'

Meanwhile Alara Morningstar said she doesn't shop at Victoria's Secret anymore because she is a 'big girl'.

'I've gone to many stores, not even shopping for myself, and gotten the "we don't have anything for people like you."'

And a woman by the name of Mary W, who wears a size 40C, says she has been turned away by Victoria's Secret saleswomen.

'I searched their racks for my size only to be told that they don't carry my cup size that big and to go to Lane Bryant.'

Victoria's Secret does, however, carry bra sizes in 40C. The largest bra size the retailer goes up to is 40DDD, and the largest underwear size is XL.

The redditor who penned the original accusations believes that Victoria's Secret employees are discriminating against certain women, refusing to sell them bra that they have in stock.

In her letter, the woman identifies as a Soma lingerie employee. 

'Far too often we hear horror stories about women, or once even a husband looking for a nice gift for his wife, being told they are "plus sized" and "in the wrong store."  

A dismissive sales associate told another woman she was 'too old,' and sent her to Lane Bryant and Soma, writes the redditor. 

'I would like to take the opportunity to use this woman's story to remind you, that here in the real world, where we don’t all look like Adriana and Behati, we still want to feel beautiful. Our job as women is to build up other women,' she explains.

Customers have no problem with Victoria's Secret bra sizes (they go up to 40DDD), but rather with staff who turn plus-size and 'older' women away
