Johnny Carson's ex-wife Joanna has vehemently denied that she stars in an alleged sex tape with the legendary talk show host

Johnny Carson's third ex-wife has denied that she is the woman featured in the talk show host's recently outed sex tape.

Former model Joanna Holland, 78, is outraged that she has been drawn into the sordid home movie scandal which allegedly features a dark-haired woman performing oral sex on the legendary Tonight show host by a swimming pool.

The tape then reportedly cuts to a 20-minute bedroom romp.

Ms Holland told the National Enquirer that she was not in the sex tape and could not be sure who was - but whoever sold the video should be ashamed.

She added: 'I do believe itâ€™s likely that a sex tape with Johnny does exist and 
was probably shot sometime in the â€™60s.'

Six-time Emmy winner Carson was married four times. In 1948, Carson married Jody Wolcott but the union ended in divorce in 1963.

He married Joanne Copeland in 1963 but divorced her in 1972 before marrying his third wife, Ms Holland that same year.

The
 legendary host was a well-known lothario. In between his four 
marriages - at least one of which was blighted by infidelity - Carson 
was a committed ladies man.

According to the biography Johnny 
Carson, written by the star's longtime lawyer and confidant Henry 
Bushkin, during
 his third marriage to Ms Holland, Carson showered 
her with gifts, including an apartment at The Pierre, a Rolls-Royce 
Corniche, and diamonds galore, as compensation for his many 
indiscretions.

'Joanna 
discovered a film of Johnny in flagrante with a comely young lady,' 
Bushkin wrote, 'after which she furiously shattered every vase, every 
picture frame, every single thing made of glass in her living room, 
creating such a dangerous mess that a hazmat team had to be hired to 
clean up.'

Holland received $20 million in cash and property in New York and California in the coupleâ€™s divorce in 1985.

The person who claims to be in possession of the X-rated tape is shopping the video around to private collectors.

According to TMZ,
 the owner of the video, which dates from the late-1970s, tried to sell 
it to the Johnny Carson estate last year but was rebuffed.

The executors of the estate threatened to sue the owner of the video if was ever released.

However,
 the video is now being touted to private collectors for an undisclosed 
sum. For legal reasons the video cannot be sold to a porn distribution 
company.

Carson passed away in 2005 at the age of 79. He is survived by his fourth wife Alexis Maas Carson.

There is no word yet on a buyer for the video.
