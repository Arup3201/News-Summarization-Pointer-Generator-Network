An acid attack victim who was horrifically scarred in a random attack wept with joy after having cosmetic surgery to restore her eyebrows.

Naomi Oni, 21, had acid hurled over her face, head and body as she made her way home to Dagenham after her shift at Westfield's Victoria's Secret store last December.

The acid burned off the skin on her face and scalp and left her temporarily blinded. She lost her eyelids, eyebrows and some of her hair in the assault.

Joy: Naomi Oni, 21, said today it 'feels so good' to have her eyebrows back after her face was badly damanged in a random acid attack

Since then, surgeons have painstakingly 
rebuilt her features including taking skin from the back of her ear to 
make new eyelids for her. But her eyebrows remained permanently damaged.

Before the incident, Naomi described 
herself as a 'girly girl' who would spend three hours getting ready to 
go out in the evening.

Having already suffered so much from the attack, knowing her eyebrows would never grow back was yet another blow to her confidence.

Now, ten months on, her skin has healed enough for her to have her eyebrows restored.

Naomi had a sophisticated semi-permanent make-up treatment that tattoos on the eyebrows as individual hairs, mimicking the effect of real brows.

Delicate technique: Semi-permanent make-up expert Debra Robson pencils in the brow before using the tattoo needle to ensure the shape is right

The cosmetic procedure was carried out by the expert Debra Robson LDN clinic on Harley Street.

Debra Robson said she had loved 
working with Naomi. She said: 'We recreated Naomi’s brows with my FAME 
technique, which builds up the brow at microscopic level, hair by hair.

'First we pencilled in the brow and got the correct shape for Naomi’s face.

'When she was happy with the shape, we
 began to build up her brows and as you can see from the pictures, the 
results were perfect.

'The key is to simulate the appearance of the natural hair – so that you can see the individual hair strokes in the new brow.

'Colour is implanted into the skin – it is very sophisticated form of cosmetic tattooing.'

Debra
 Robson, who also worked with Katie Piper after her acid attack, also 
specialises in scar and skin camouflage and areola reconstruction – for 
breast cancer sufferers who have undergone mastectomies.

Naomi's semi-permanent brows will last between nine months and a year before she requires a top-up.

She says: 'They are beautiful – I’m so pleased I had it done.'

Pioneering technique: Debra Robson has developed a technique to draw on hairs individually to mimic real brows. She uses a similar technique to recreate areola on women who have had mastectomies

Now, in her first public appearance since 
February, when she movingly described on breakfast show This Morning how
 her life was turned upside down when she was doused in sulphuric acid, Naomi 
reveals on camera the extent of her suffering - and how she has managed 
to rebuild her life.

Naomi faces further intricate laser surgery as doctors strive to lessen
 the impact of her scars and reconstruct her face, using the same 
methods used on Kate Piper.

She said: 'It has been very difficult to come to terms with.

'My doctors have been brilliant but it will take years of laser surgery to repair my face.

'There is only so much you can do at any one time – then there is long healing process before you can undergo the next stage of the treatment.

'It is only now that I had been able to have semi-permanent make-up on my face.

'Girly girl': Before the attack Naomi said she would spend three hours getting ready for a night out

'I loved having the treatment – it feels so good to have my eyebrows back.

'What
 I loved about the treatment was its intricacy – it is a form of 
cosmetic tattooing.  It is the closest you can get to mimicking the 
appearance of the original brow.'

In
 the video below, Naomi can be seen having the treatment in video – as 
well as the moment she weeps for joy when she sees her new brows.

Naomi
 smiled: 'I did get a bit emotional when I saw them. It’s the first time
 I have seen myself with eyebrows for almost a year.'

Naomi
 is on leave from her job at Victoria's Secret lingerie store at 
Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, East London, while she recovers.

She eventually plans to return to work and pursue her dream of becoming a make-up artist.

Naomi, from London, is still at a loss to explain why she was targeted.

She said: 'I asked, "why me?" I work hard, I’m a good person.

'I’m the same person now but stronger.

Brave: Naomi, who last night won an award for bravery at the Women of Inspiration awards, said of her attacker, 'They can burn by skin but they can't burn my soul'

'I want to say to my attacker, "You can burn my skin but you can’t burn my soul."'

Naomi was on the phone to her boyfriend after returning from work when she was attacked in Dagenham, Essex, on December 30 last year.

She said: 'I felt a splash – that’s when I thought, someone’s out to kill me.

'I just started running straight home. I knew it was acid. It feels like something is eating way at your skin. I felt it most on my scalp, more than my face.'

She arrived at her home shouting and banging on the door, screaming ‘acid, acid.’

Her family came to the door thinking she was excited about something.

Then when her mother opened the door, Naomi said everyone’s faces ‘just dropped.’

Naomi was last night honoured for her bravery with a prize at the Inspiration for Women Awards at Cadogan Hall in Chelsea.
