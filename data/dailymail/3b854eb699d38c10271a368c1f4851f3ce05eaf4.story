Commons Speaker John Bercow and wife Sally enjoyed the Royal Box at Wimbledon

Freebie-loving MPs have cashed in on corporate hospitality, enjoying junkets worth £120,000 in the past year.

As well as receiving free tickets to major sporting events, they were also treated to pheasant shooting weekends, seats at awards ceremonies and even the use of a Jaguar.

Commons Speaker, John Bercow, a keen tennis fan, was at Queen’s tennis club to see Andy Murray win the Aegon Championship on June 16.

Mr Bercow registered the value of the seat as £1,070. He was also given two Centre Court tickets to Wimbledon worth £148 for June 29 by the Lawn Tennis Association.

Harriet Harman, Labour’s deputy leader, received two tickets to Wimbledon in the Royal Box and lunch for two. The £2,790 bill was picked up by the All England Club.

In total, 77 MPs received freebies last year, according to the register.

Former Justice Secretary Ken Clarke shared a £6,346 trip to the British Grand Prix at Silverstone with Tory MPs Ben Wallace and Mark Garnier and Labour’s Peter Hain and Richard Burden.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson took his wife to Royal Ascot as a guest of online gambling firm Betfair, which paid the £1,000 cost.

Labour business spokesman Chuka Umunna was given tickets worth £3,060 to the Baftas and Mobo awards, while Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright was loaned a Jaguar XRG so he could go for a spin.

The gift was worth £790.

Tory MPs Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, Edward Garnier, Graham Brady, Bill Wiggin, Sir Gerald Howarth and Simon Reevell enjoyed a lavish shooting weekend at Catton Hall estate in Derbyshire at a cost of around £800 each, paid by the British Association for Shooting and Conservation.

Mr Garnier also accepted tickets to the Chelsea Flower Show from tobacco giant JTI.

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith (left) took his son to see Tottenham Hotspur play Arsenal, with Spurs paying the £2,400 bill. MP Chuka Umunna was given tickets to the Baftas and Mobo awards, together worth more than £3,000

Peter Luff, a former defence minister, accepted a day’s shooting in Gloucestershire worth £2,000 from weapons manufacturer QinetiQ.

Although thousands of British sports fans missed out on Olympic tickets, many MPs were more fortunate. Labour leader Ed Miliband declared that he and his wife were guests of organiser Locog at both the opening and closing ceremonies.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith took his son to see Tottenham Hotspur’s match against  Arsenal, with Spurs paying the £2,400 bill.

Arsenal lavished £1,200 on Tory MP Michael Ellis and his aide, who attended a Champions League game with Montpellier.

Another Tory, Nigel Adams, received two tickets to the Grand National at Aintree worth £900, paid for by John Smith’s brewery, while Labour’s Steve Rotherham enjoyed hospitality there worth £800

Labour’s Nia Griffith and Huw Irranca-Davies and Tory John Penrose were guests at Six Nations Rugby matches.

Although the MPs have not broken any rules, provided the hospitality was declared in their register of interests, the junkets dismayed campaigners.

Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Anyone who feels their MP has spent excessive time living it up at someone else’s expense can remember it when they vote.’

Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, said: ‘MPs should not be living the high life while workers struggle.'
