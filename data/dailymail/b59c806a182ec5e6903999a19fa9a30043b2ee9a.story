An artificial pancreas, a smart bed that massages you to sleep, and washing up gloves with a built-in soap dispenser are among the 20 shortlisted inventions of this year's British Inventor's Project. 

Other finalists include the Kikka Digga, a
 clip-on device that makes digging in the garden easier, and the 
Hydroguard, designed as a portable flood defence system.

The project's finalists will be showcased at the Gadget Show Live in April and visitors will be able to use the products that have been specifically designed to help with everyday tasks.

A total of 20 inventions have been shortlisted as part of the British Inventors Project, including the Wi-Fi enabled bed from Balluga, illustration pictured. It is a smart interactive bed with adjustable firmness, climate control and a built-in vibro massage system

All of the finalists will also present their products live on stage in the Innovation Theatre throughout the show, and one will be crowned British Innovation of the Year 2014.

The artificial pancreas, currently going through pre-clinical trials, was designed by Renfrew Group with support from researchers at De Montfort University.

It automatically regulates glucose levels using a so-called polymeric gel that manages the delivery of insulin into the peritoneum. It does not rely on the kind of electronic controls used in current artificial organs.

The Artificial Pancreas is an implantable device which has been designed specifically for sufferers of Type 1 diabetes - a large proportion of which are at risk of over or under medicating with current treatment methods, according to the inventors.

The HydroGuard invention, pictured, is a reusable flood protection device that can be quickly put in place by homeowners. It fits any door type and is expandable, meaning the unit expands to fit any door size. It works by sealing the door and prevents water from being able to get through

The Kikka Digga device, illustration pictured left, is an invention designed to 'overcome the laborious task of digging.' It attaches to any garden fork or spade, pictured right, and has a step that's used to place more evenly spread pressure and force to the digger. The product is currently at final prototype phase

The Commuter X4 rear lighting system for cyclists, pictured, was designed to give them better protection and make them more visible on the road at night

'We have reached a critical point in the development of a device which could ultimately immeasurably improve lives,' said researcher Professor Taylor.

The Balluga Bed is a smart interactive bed with adjustable firmness, climate control and a built-in vibro massage system, all with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.

This project has so far been funded privately but inventors from Balluga are set to launch an Indiegogo crowdfunding project in the coming weeks.

Artifical pancreas: Developed by medical scientists form the Renfrew Group and DeMontfort University, the device automatically regulates glucose levels using polymeric gel that manages the delivery of insulin into the peritoneum. It does not rely on the kind of electronic controls used in current artificial organs.

Balluga Bed: A smart, interactive bed with adjustable firmness, climate control and a built-in vibro massage system, all with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.

Commuter X4: A rear lighting system for cyclists to give better protection and make them more visible on the road at night.

Doorjammer: A portable door-stop for use in hotels to give travellers additional security and peace of mind.

Roam folding bike: A folding bike which can be packed away and towed easily like a wheelie suitcase.

Rotite: A clip that joins two surfaces together.

Kikka Digga: A device which clips on to a garden fork or spade and makes light work of heavy digging.

Move It Furniture: A range of flat-pack cardboard furniture that is light to carry, but durable when assembled.

Plume Mudguard: A retractable mudguard which clips to any standard bike.

Splatform: A freeform construction toy for modellers.

Hummingbird Corkscrew: A new design for an easy way to open wine bottles (pictured above).

Marxman Pen: A simple way to mark up walls and ceilings for drilling which can be operated with one hand (pictured below).

Retrack: A device that clips to the back of a helmet and records bike rides and skateboard jumps from various angles. It then produces a 3D animated action replay on a smartphone that shows different angles, showing your speed, angle of descent and the movement.  

Sq-easy Glove: A washing-up glove with an in-built refillable soap dispenser.

Hydroguard: HydroGuard is a reusable flood protection device, which can be quickly put in place by homeowners. It fits any door size and type, and seals entrances to prevent water entering the home.

All Product Design: A
 matchbox-sized device that powers garden lights, for example, using 
radio waves and mobile signals. All Product Design has also invented a 
device that collects power from 'flat' batteries to extend their life by
 around three weeks.

Mini Rigs: High-volume, battery-operated speakers (pictured above).

Tappy: A bath tap protector for small children that also transforms into a hand puppet.

Beachbag Plus: A beach bag that folds out over a beach lounger with cool bag, wet pockets and secret pockets for valuables (pictured right).

Pinstar Putting Cup: Designed for golfers, this putting target can be used indoors and outdoors, on any carpeted or smooth grass surface, for putting practise.

IT-Tub: Technology for sealing tubs and pots that is easy to lock and open again as well as being airtight and watertight when closed.

Its inventors claim it 'splits the ground like a hot knife through butter' and was designed with developing countries in mind, 'for those that cannot afford a plough or need help in growing both large and small scale - agriculture and horticulture.'

At the moment the product is currently at final prototype phase and should be ready for production 'very soon.'

Elsewhere, the HydroGuard is a reusable flood protection device, which can be quickly put in place  by homeowners. 

Sq-easy Gloves, pictured, are another finalist. They are washing-up gloves with an in-built refillable soap dispenser

It fits any door type and is expandable, meaning the unit expands to fit any door size. It works by sealing the door and prevents water from being able to get through.

HydroGuard has produced the first full-scale prototype, which will be launched at the Gadget Show Live and will be followed by a Kickstarter campaign.

Another finalist is the Sq-easy Gloves - washing-up and cleaning gloves that are fitted with an in-built, refillable soap dispenser.

As wearers wash up, they can squeeze a small capsule of liquid to produce more suds. Sq-easy Gloves has also developed a family range for parents to use while bathing their children - removing the need to hold the child in one hand and use shampoo in another.

The firm is finalising a contract with a manufacturer based in China, once this is done they will pay for tooling equipment and then go on to receive production samples. After this stage they plan to go to full production and have the product available later in the year.

Meanwhile, the All Product Design is a matchbox-sized device that powers electronics, such as garden lights, by harnessing radio waves and mobile signals.

All Product Design has also invented a device that collects power from 'flat' batteries to extend their life by up to three weeks - depending on the device.

Mark Sheahan, inventor in residence at the British Library's Business and IP Centre, and a British Invention Project finalist with his It-Tub technology, said: 'Itâ€™s fantastic the Gadget Show Live is helping to shine a much-needed spotlight on British inventors and innovation.

'Itâ€™s not that we donâ€™t have the creativity and talent in the UK, but we do struggle when it comes to attracting the funding and investment needed to both make that initial leap required to take a design to market.'

Other shortlisted inventions include the BeachBag Plus - a beach bag that folds out over a beach lounger with cool bag, wet pockets and secret pockets for valuables.

The bag is now on sale online with Bunker Bound and the inventor is talking to distributors and retailers in the UK who have agreed to take it this year.

These include The British Garden centres and the Oldrids group based in Grantham.
