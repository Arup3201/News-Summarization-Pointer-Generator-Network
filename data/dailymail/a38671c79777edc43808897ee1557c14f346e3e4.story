Cabin crew trainees have reportedly hit out at the cost of training and work conditions at a company that supplies Ryanair with staff.

Ireland-based Crewlink charges trainees nearly £2,000 in tuition fees for a course that will help them get work at the airline company.

Staff are reportedly too afraid to speak out about their working conditions directly, because their contracts state they must not speak to the media.

Trainees have criticised the cost of training and work conditions at a company that supplies Ryanair

The news comes after Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said he wanted to reform his company's culture and help lose its 'macho' image.

The Irish airline promised an overhaul of its bedside manner over the next six months, in a charm offensive that runs contrary to its existing strategy.

It will operate ‘quiet flights’ before 8am and after 9pm, bringing an end to repetitive adverts for scratchcards and music played over the aeroplane PA.

Passengers will also be given a 24-hour grace period to change bookings.

Many Ryanair cabin crew are reportedly supplied by Crewlink, which takes peopl on after they have completed six weeks of training.

It offers its own training, but also accepts trainees from St James Management Services, which is based in Cirencester, Gloucestershire.

The St James course costs trainees £1,650 in one payment, or £1,800 in installments. Those who choose to pay in installments have £150 taken off their salary a month to cover the cost of the course.

But according to the Observer, many who go on the course are rejected during a probationary period and still have to pay the training bill.

Crewlink told the paper that more than 95 per cent remain in the company’s employment after six months. But the report said St James ‘routinely’ tells trainees it will instruct a debt-collecting agency to pursue outstanding fees.

The Crewlink contract, meanwhile, makes clear the training does not guarantee a Ryanair job. The paper says the contract explains there are no provisions for sick pay and crew must pay £30 a month for their uniforms for the first year.

Crewlink employees are reported to be paid £13.39 an hour in flight pay and can be transferred between Ryanair bases with no compensation.

Staff are also expected to work a number of standby days where they must be available within one hour of being called.

Crewlink declined to comment on 'inaccurate claims' about its contract and told the paper staff were free to leave the company if they were unhappy with terms and conditions.

A Ryanair spokesman told MailOnline: ‘We don’t use 3rd parties to train our staff. Like many other airlines, we only recruit fully trained and qualified cabin crew.

‘Once cabin crew start working for Ryanair, we pay for all their recurrent training, which is exactly what other airlines do.’
