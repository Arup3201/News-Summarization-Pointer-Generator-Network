The trilby - a hat synonymous with celebrities Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake - is risky enough as a fashion statement.

But now the headpiece has foiled an armed robbery, after a trilby-wearing gunman gave up on his heist when staff refused to take him seriously.

The botched robbery began when the man entered a Seville, Spain, pharmacy shortly before closing time.

He approaches the counter before he pulls out the gun from his coat pocket

He then reveals the gun and waves it in the face of a pharmacist, who refuses to give him any money

As an assistant went to help a couple of customers with a baby, the man wearing glasses and a beard is seen approaching the counter.Â 

He then pulls out a gun and points it at pharmacist Amaru Barrios Ruiz, 27.

Mr Ruiz said: 'He demanded money and I just told him simply he wasn't going to get anything.

'He looked completely dumbfounded and repeated the demand pointing the gun at me again. So I pushed it away and told him no.'

As the botched robbery was being played out only a few feet away customers and other pharmacists carried on their business completely oblivious to the scene unfolding beside them.

Customer Bianca Sierra Lozano, 34, said: 'I was vaguely aware of the man at the counter but wasn't the slightest bit interested in what he wanted.'

After he is unable to frighten Mr Ruiz into handing over money, the frustrated crook walks over to the other pharmacist who also tells him to go away.

Unsure what to do, he stands in an aisle looking at the customers and pharmacists, before he finally gives up and walks out.

Mr Ruiz said: 'It was pretty bizarre really, both for us and I guess especially for him. He wanted to rob us and more or less got ignored.'

Although they clerks' refusal to hand over money ended without incident, a police spokesman said the staff were lucky.

He said: 'I think they were quite lucky and we urge anyone who sees someone with a gun to alert the police at the earliest opportunity, and not to [deal with the situation] themselves.'
