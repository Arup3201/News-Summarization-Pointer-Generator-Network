New look: Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema

The Portuguese forward was joined by 
Xabi Alonso, Sergio Ramos, Iker Casillas, Marcelo, Bale and Karim 
Benzema in modelling the Champions League winners' new look.

Real had released a teaser video 
starring Bale which hinted that they would be wearing pink, and they 
confirmed that suggestion on Monday.

Not only is Real Madrid's away kit all pink, but their home kit also features pink trim down the sides and along the back.

Both kits are available to order from the Real Madrid online store.

British fans will get a glimpse of either one of the new strips when Real Madrid take on Sevilla in the European Super Cup in Cardiff at the beginning of next season.
