A 12-year-old boy left critically injured following a deliberate house fire in South Yorkshire has died from his injuries, police confirmed.

Jack Sykes died in hospital last night, less than a week after his father Darren, 44, and brother Paul, nine, died in the fire in Penistone in Barnsley, South Yorkshire.

Police investigating the tragedy said evidence confirmed that the fire was 'started deliberately' and that an accelerant was used.

Police confirmed the fire last Wednesday was started deliberately with an accelerated and officers stressed they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. Pictured: Mr Sykes with his two sons

Officers stressed that they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident and it is feared that Mr Sykes – who recently separated from his wife and mother of the two boys – was behind the incident.

The youngster's heartbroken mother Claire, 42, was at her son's bedside when he passed away.

Neighbours said flames suddenly swept through the semi-detached house at around 6.30pm last Wednesday.

The boys were staying with their carpet salesman father, and firemen found all three occupants on the first floor after they entered the building wearing breathing apparatus.

Neighbours added that they heard no screams or cries for help from inside.

Post mortem examinations confirmed that the victims' injuries were 'consistent with being involved in a fire'.

Barrie Hall, 73, a retired security officer, said he was returning from a nearby park when he saw 'acrid smoke coming out of the house'.

He said the 'fire brigade came and started sorting it out' and police told local residents to go inside.

The fire which ravaged the semi-detached house in South Yorkshire was started deliberately with accelerant

He said: 'We didn't know until later that anybody was in there It was a shock. It's terrible. It just blows you away.'

Mr Hall said the family had lived there together until the boys left with their mother at some point in the past few months.

'Mr Sykes lived there on his own, I believe they were separated,' he said, adding that Mr Sykes adored his children.

'He loved his kids. You'd hear him playing with them all the time. I would say was he was a bigger kid than his kids.'

South Yorkshire Police today confirmed Jack had succumbed to his critical injuries. 

A spokesman said: 'A 12-year-old boy left critically ill following a house fire in Penistone has died as a result of his injuries.

'Emergency services were called to a house on Tennyson Close at around 6.30pm on Wednesday, October 22. A man and his two sons were rescued from the property by firefighters.

'Darren Sykes, 44, and his nine-year-old son Paul Sykes both died as a result of the fire.

'His older son Jack Sykes was taken to hospital in a critical condition but lost his fight for life last night.

Flowers were attached to nine-year-old Paul's school gates with the message: 'You will be sadly missed'

People arrived at the scene in Penistone, South Yorkshire, to leave flowers for Mr Sykes and his sons

Police officers cordoned off the quiet cul-de-sac last week while an investigation into the fire was launched

'Detectives investigating the fire have confirmed it was started deliberately and that an accelerant was used. Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.

'The investigation continues on behalf of the coroner.'

Jack attended Penistone Grammar School and Paul was a pupil at Springvale Primary School, also in Penistone.

After Paul's death, headteacher Andy Platt said: 'Following the recent tragic events in Penistone, all of us at Springvale Primary School wish to offer our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Paul Sykes at this very difficult time

'Paul was an outgoing, popular boy who was blossoming into a fine runner and cornet player. He will be greatly missed.

'The pupils and staff at Springvale are being very well supported, both by an experienced team of specialists from Barnsley Council and members of the wider community.'
