These are the roads that offer a 'doorway' into Britain's past.

From Roman streets to bustling 20th century markets, these 50 have been named the most historically important in the country.

House historian Melanie Backe-Hansen compiled the list from thousands of candidates across England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland.

Picturesque: The Street in Castle Combe in Wiltshire has been named in a list of the most important historic roads in Britain and is the favourite of historian Melanie Backe-Hansen

Preserved: The history of Eastgate Street in Chester dates back to Roman times when it was first planned

Opulent: Belgrave Square is one of the grandest of 19th-century London. It was laid out by property contractor Thomas Cubitt for the 2nd Earl Grosvenor in the 1820s and most of the houses were occupied by 1840

She says she wanted to delve beneath the surface of roads that people walk past every day without knowing their historical importance.

The 50 streets that made the list in her book Historic Streets and Squares span hundreds of years.

The oldest are Steep Hill in Lincoln and Eastgate Street in Chester, which were originally planned by the Romans.

The 50 also includes an array of medieval lanes, Georgian crescents and Victorian squares.

Historic: Richmond Green in Richmond has been surrounded by houses for over 400 years

Retained: Merrion Square in Dublin was laid out in 1762 and was largely completed by the beginning of the 19th century and is considered one of the city's finest surviving squares

Important: Kensington Square in Kensington was founded in 1685 and is thus the oldest in London

Ms Backe-Hansen said she wanted to show 
how the streets, squares, crescents, avenues and lanes of our cities 
reveal much about our past.

She told Mail Online: 'I was essentially highlighting the history behind the streets. Many people walk along these roads and not blink an eyelid.

'I wanted to look behind what we are used to.

'It was not just looking at architectural styles but why they were built and the type of people who lived there and look beneath the surface.

Famous faces: Great Pulteney Street in Bath was home to William Wilberforce and the mistress to the King

Stately: St Ann's Square in Manchester was built after a 1708 Act of Parliament granted the erection of a church and also stipulated that a space 30 yards wide should be reserved for the fair

Upmarket: Park Circus in Glasgow, filled with large townhouses, is considered one of the most prestigious addresses in the city

'I lot of these roads are among the 
most well known in the country, like Portobello Road, but people won't 
know how it got like that.'

The book also reveals some of the stories behind the residents of these famous streets.

Great Pulteney Street in Bath boasts a notable string of past residents including anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce, and the mistresses of George IV and Admiral Nelson.

College Street in Winchester was the home of Jane Austen.

But Ms Backe-Hansen said her favourite is The Street, in Castle Combe, Wiltshire, the former home of Sir John Falstaff.

Architecturally important: Sussex Square in Brighton is filled with classic Regency houses

Internationally famous: Charlotte Square in Edinburgh is part of the New Town, which is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
It was named after King George III's Queen and first daughter and the first phase of the build was completed in 1820

She said: 'It is beautiful. It has been retained in its historic form and is pretty special.'

The historian hopes many of the unprotected but historically valuable streets and squares in the country can be protected.

She said: 'I am a traditionalist so I would like to see them preserved but I realise that is not always possible.

'There are still streets all over the country that have special historical elements but may not be protected.

'I would prefer to see them as they are now.'
