Murder victim Rachel Manning, who was found dumped near a golf course in Milton Keynes

A restaurant worker was responsible for strangling a teenage girl and dumping her body 12 years ago, a jury heard today.

Shahidul Ahmed, 41, murdered shop assistant Rachel Manning, 18, after she made a late night call from a public phone box in Milton Keynes, then drove her body to a golf course where he left it in the undergrowth, it is alleged.

After killing her he disfigured her face with a car steering lock, it is claimed.

Today, Ahmed, of Bletchley, 
Buckinghamshire, went on trial for the murder, which was alleged to have
happened on Sunday December 10, 2000.

The Bangladesh-born defendant denies 
the charge. Russell Gumpert, prosecuting, said DNA found on the steering
lock matched the accused's.

The lock was discovered by the road 
'on the direct route between the spot where the body was hidden and 
Shahidul Ahmed's home in Bletchley'.

Luton Crown Court also heard Ahmed sold his 
car eight days after Miss Manning, who had been to a fancy dress party 
then a nightclub, was murdered.

The jury of seven women and five men 
heard that Ahmed came to police attention in May 2010 when he was 
arrested for an unrelated matter.

It was at this point officers matched
his DNA to the unsolved murder, the jury was told. Mr Gumpert said the 
victim was strangled with a soft ligature.

'Her body was deposited in the 
undergrowth at Woburn Golf Club about eight miles from the centre of 
Milton Keynes,' said the barrister.

'The prosecution case is that she was 
murdered by Shahidul Ahmed and that he attacked her close to a telephone
box in Milton Keynes from which she had just made a call, before 
driving her body to the golf club and disposing of it.

'There is no evidence which points to 
any particular motive, although it seems likely that the impulse to 
attack her would have been a sexual one.

'Whether he always intended to kill her, or only did so because she was not willing to comply with his demands is unknown.'

Bangladesh-born Shahidul Ahmed, 41, is on trial at Luton Crown Court for murder

Miss Manning's boyfriend Barri White was convicted of her murder in 2002. His conviction was later quashed on appeal and he was acquitted at a retrial in 2008.

Miss Manning had been to a 70s' theme party with Mr White and her friends on Saturday December 9, 2000.

They went on to Chicago's nightclub and left at about 2.15am, with Mr White walking to stay at a friend, Keith Hyatt's, home. Miss Manning walked off alone, to catch a taxi.

She phoned her home in Wolverton from the phone box at 2.43am and spoke to her flatmate to say she was upset.

The flatmate, Chris Gardiner, phoned her back but the call failed. She then phoned Mr White and said she did not know where she was.

The pair, who had been drinking, agreed to meet at a Blockbuster video store and he and Mr Hyatt would pick her up. When they arrived at 3.13am in Mr Hyatt's white van she was not there.

The prosecutor said it was likely that she was already dead. Mr White went out again later on foot and called to see her at work the next day. When he heard she had not shown up he alerted the police.
