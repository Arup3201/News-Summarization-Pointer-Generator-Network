Painful: Sam Smith from Litherland,  Merseyside, who suffered second degree burns after spilling a McDonald's hot chocolate over her groin. She is pictured with all the dressings the hospital gave her

A 22-year-old woman has threated legal action against McDonalds after she spilled a cup of hot chocolate on her lap when she went for a drive-thru meal.

Sam Smith, of Litherland, Merseyside, says she was so severely injured she may now require plastic surgery after the trip to the Switch Island branch of the global fast food firm.

The estate agent suffered second-degree burns from the 85C drink and says going to the toilet is 'torture'.

She claims the cup was over-filled, the lid was not attached correctly and the cup holder was not adequate to hold the two beverages.

McDonalds is now investigating her claims.

Ms Smith told the Liverpool Echo: 'They were too full, and there was a sharp bend and a speed bump in the drive-through, for some strange reason.

'I can't walk properly now, and shuffle around like a frog. Going to the toilet is excruciating.'

The area affected is covered in blisters, even though her mother Alison immediately doused her daughter's lap with a bottle of water.

Ms Smith had to be treated at a specialist burns hospital in nearby Whiston.

She is now considering legal action against McDonalds.

Her mother added that she is thinking of starting a campaign highlighting the dangers of hot drinks from drive-throughs.

A spokesman for McDonald’s said: 'We are sorry to hear that Mrs Smith’s daughter sustained an injury following her visit to our drive-through restaurant and we hope she makes a speedy recovery.

'The safety and wellbeing of our customers and employees is our first priority and all of our restaurant crew are trained to serve hot drinks in a safe manner, with lids firmly secured.

'We have launched a full investigation and our customer services team will be in touch with Mrs Smith.'

Stella Liebeck, 79, suffered third-degree burns when she accidentally spilled hot coffee in her lap after buying it from a McDonald's restaurant in 1992.

The grandmother was hospitalised for eight days while she underwent skin grafting, followed by two years of medical treatment.

Although the case was presented as frivolous in media reports, it had important and long-lasting implications for civil law in the U.S.

A jury awarded her $200,000 in damages, later reduced to $160,000 because it found she was 20 per cent at fault. It also awarded her $2.7 million in punitive damages.

The judge later reduced the punitive award to $480,000, even though he criticised McDonald's conduct.

Since Liebeck's case, McDonald's has not reduced the service temperature of its coffee. McDonald's policy today is to serve coffee between 80–90C.

Experts testified that coffee at that temperature, if spilled, causes third-degree burns in two to seven seconds. Typical at-home coffee machines brew their drinks at about 30 degrees lower.

Ms Liebeck died at the age of 91 in 2004.
