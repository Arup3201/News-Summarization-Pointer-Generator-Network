Real Sociedad announced David Moyes as their new manager, despite the Scot insisting he is 'slightly surprised' with the club's announcement.

Though the 18-month deal is yet to be confirmed by those in the Moyes camp, there have been a fair few British managers try their luck abroad. 

Here, Sportsmail look at how other British managers have fared abroad throughout history.

SIR BOBBY ROBSON

Perhaps the most successful British coach to have managed abroad. 

After guiding England to the semi-finals of Italia '90, Robson moved to PSV Eindhoven, where he replaced Guus Hiddink. Despite struggling to curb Romario's party antics, Robson led PSV to back to back Eredivisie titles. 

After an unsuccessful spell at Sporting Lisbon, Robson won successive Portuguese titles at FC Porto before landing one of the top jobs in European football - that of Barcelona manager. Robson won the Cup Winners' Cup and the Copa del Rey during his first season at the club, but that did not save him from the sack.

Jose Mourinho and Andre Villas-Boas, who both worked with Robson, owe a huge debt of gratitude to the late Englishman, as does Pep Guardiola, who played under him at Barcelona. Robson coached some of the best players in world football, including former Brazil striker Ronaldo, who described his old coach as 'a father figure' during their time together at Barca.

JOHN TOSHACK

Another man to have been in the hot seat at Sociedad. Toshack in fact managed Sociedad on no fewer than three occasions during a management career that has taken the Welshman to eight countries.

Toshack guided Sociedad to their second Copa del Rey in history 27 years ago and then went to Real Madrid. Toshack won the Primera Division in his first year after a team containing the likes of Bernd Schuster, Emilio Butragueno and a young Fernando Hierro scored 107 goals.

He was sacked just 11 games into the 1990-91 season, though, and returned to Sociedad. Madrid came calling for Toshack again but he lasted just one season after criticising his players.

Toshack also managed Deportivo La Coruna, Besiktas, St Etienne, Catania, Real Murcia, Macedonia and Khazar Lankaran in Azerbaijan. Now he manages Moroccan side Wydad Casablanca.

ROY HODGSON

Another multi-lingual coach who has travelled the length and breadth of the world. 

Hodgson started his career in Sweden, winning the title on two occasions with Halmstad. He then won the Allsvenska five years in a row with Malmo before moving to Switzerland where he managed the national side after a spell with Neuchatel Xamax.

After leading the Swiss to their first major championships in 28 years, Hodgson departed for Inter Milan where he coached the likes of Javier Zanetti, Youri Djorkaeff and Paul Ince to a UEFA Cup final in 1997, which they lost to Schalke. 

Hodgson managed Inter again and had spells in Finland, Norway and the United Arab Emirates before returning to England.

TERRY VENABLES

After tasting success at Crystal Palace and QPR, the Barcelona board handed Venables the manager's job at the Nou Camp upon the recommendation of Sir Bobby Robson. 'El Tel' as he became known, spent three years at Barca. 

He won the league in his first year at the Catalonian club and guided them to the 1986 European Cup final where they lost to Steaua Bucharest in a penalty shootout.

Despite the arrival of Gary Lineker and Mark Hughes, Barcelona could not win and lost out to Real Madrid by one point in '87 and Venables was dismissed soon after.

Venables resigned in shame from his only other role away from Britain, that of Australia coach. The Socceroos had led 3-1 in their World Cup play-off against Iran, but conceded two late goals and therefore missed out on France '98 despite extensive backing from the national football association.

STEVE MCCLAREN

The current Derby manager went to Holland to rebuild his reputation following a disastrous spell in charge of England. 

The move paid off as he led Twente to their maiden Eredivisie title in his second year in charge.

He was then appointed Wolfsburg coach, but was sacked just nine months later. McClaren returned to Twente for a second time but lasted just over a year before resigning due to supporter unrest.
