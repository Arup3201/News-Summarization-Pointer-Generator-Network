Graeme Ross, 39, from Whishaw, Glasgow, has lost a staggering 6st to go on to compete professionally as a body builder.

At his heaviest Graeme weighed 18st 9lb, and a 40in  waist.

Unable to climb stairs without becoming breathless and embarrassed of his body, Graeme still struggled to curb his addiction to junk food.

Junk food addict Graeme would sometimes eat several take-aways in a single day 

He commented; 'I knew my eating was getting out of control when, to my shame, I once called the local chip shop three times in one night, firstly to order a steak pie supper, second to order a black pudding supper and then again to order a fish supper.

'I knew I was gaining a lot of weight but I couldn't stop eating and drinking. Some nights I would go to McDonalds at 2am in the morning for a Big Mac Meal, nuggets and a McFlurry! I was out of control.

'I could barely climb the stairs, I would get so breathless and the sweating was something else. I wouldn't go swimming or ever change in front of anyone. People stare at you when you're bigger.'

The moment of realisation came for Graeme when he went shopping for a new pair of jeans. 

He believed he was a size 36in waist but after trying a few pairs on he noticed that he had fluctuated to a size 40in waist. 

From that moment on, Graeme cut out all sugar from his diet, stopped drinking and joined his local football team.  

Graeme's size was taking a toll and he was shocked that he had gone up four sizes before he began his diet (left). Now he eats a strict six meals a day of low fat, high protein foods to achieve his physique (right)

As a result he lost 6st in the first 5 months and started regularly going to the gym.

It was here that he met some advanced bodybuilders who inspired him to start weight training. 

Since then he has undergone a complete body transformation and has started competing professionally as a middleweight body builder.

Adopting a regimented diet plan of six small meals a day Graeme now starts his day with rolled oats and PhD chocolate protein, followed by five meals of either rice or sweet potatoes with grilled chicken and vegetables. 

'The guys at the gym recommended I start taking protein supplements to help me gain muscle mass, so I tried the PhD pharma whey shake and loved it!

From being too embarrassed of his body to go swimming, Graeme is now confident posing in front of thousands in just a tiny pair of pants 

'I add it to my porridge first thing in the morning, and use their protein chocolate bars as a treat in between workouts.

'The meal plan is strict but you get used to it. I get up and make all my meals for the day so I'm ready.' 

Now Graeme, who recently won the title  Scottish middleweight champion in the British National Bodybuilding Federation competition, not only has a new body but a new passion in life which has changed his outlook completely.

'I love everything I'm doing now.

'I can stand on stage in front of thousands of people in a tiny pair of pants and feel confident. It is so different to how I felt before.'
