Riot police faced off with students at the University of Kentucky last night as disappointed fans lit fires and hurled liquor bottles after their team lost the NCAA final.

Drunk fans took to the streets of Lexington in large numbers, clutching bottles of whisky, burning team jerseys and smashing street furniture as police in hard hats fought to contain the disorder.

One student at the college was pictured being led away with blood streaming down her face after being struck by a liquor bottle thrown with abandon.

The agony of defeat: Kentucky's losing party continued until late in the night

The violent scenes came as fans of the winning team at the University of Connecticut smashed windows, broke street lights and trashed furniture in celebration of their team's triumph.

Thousands danced in the rain in the campus plaza where college officials had hired a DJ and soundsystem in a vain effort to keep students under control.

But while many enjoyed the moment with good-natured celebration, others hung from trees and light poles or hurled firecrackers. At one point, a firework burst just above the boiling crowd - sparking screams and panic among those below.

Uconn campus police had made 30 
arrests by the early hours of this morning, while state police had made 
others and more were expected over the outburst of rowdy celebrations 
across the college grounds.

'A
 lot of it was alcohol-related,' said university spokesman Tom Breen. 
'There was breach of peace, destruction of property, and we had a 
fireworks charge.'

Most of the property damage was minor, he added, and no serious injuries had been reported.

Despite
 the rowdy scenes, Uconn Police Chief Barbara O'Connor said that 'by 
far, most of our students have conducted themselves safely and 
responsibly.'

Bread and circuses: More than 10,000 UConn students had shaken the stands inside the Pavilion, before erupting in cheers and storming the floor as the Huskies beat Kentucky 60-54 in the NCAA title game

Jubilation: Students waited in line for up to four hours to get a seat inside the arena just to watch on three big screens as their team played 1,700 miles away in Arlington, Texas

More than 
10,000 UConn students had shaken the stands inside Gampel Pavilion, 
before erupting in cheers and storming the arena floor as the Huskies 
beat Kentucky 60-54 in the NCAA title game.

The victory gave the university its fourth national championship - and its second in four years.

'I'm
 just so happy to be a Husky right now,' said Mike Butkus, a 21-year-old
 senior from Naugatuck. 'So much pride. The last 20 years, you'd be 
hard-pressed to find a program more successful than us.'

UConn's Shabazz Napier was named Outsanding Player as his team took the NCAA Championship

Napier scored 22 points in the game as well as taking six rebounds

This was Napier's last game as a college student

Napier told the crowd they were the 'Hungry Huskies' after being banned from the postseason last year due to academic failures

Students
 waited in line for up to four hours to get a seat inside the arena just
 to watch on three big screens as their team played 1,700 miles away in 
Arlington, Texas.

The arena was filled a half-hour after the doors opened, and hundreds more fans were turned away.

'It's
 my first year of college, you've got to go big,' said Ryan Massicotte, 
an 18-year-old freshman from Naugatuck who was sporting a fuzzy Husky 
dog hat and sunglasses with the dog logo on each lens. 'You've got to 
show it off the right way.'

Connecticut point guard Shabazz Napier, left, with head coach Kevin Ollie, said he sometimes can't afford food as a student athlete

Napier is hopeful efforts to form a student athlete union at Northwestern will lead to unions at other schools

The
 students sang the national anthem, chanted 'Let's go Huskies' before 
the tip, roared when the home team was introduced and booed the Kentucky
 players.

The stands shook 
every time Shabazz Napier made a 3-pointer. The pep band and school 
dance team entertained the crowd during timeouts.

They jumped up and down chanting 'I believe that we will win' as the Huskies struggled through a second-half rally by Kentucky.

A
 few minutes later, as the final seconds ticked off the clock in Texas, 
they pushed their way on the floor, turning it into a giant mosh pit as 
their belief became a 60-54 reality.
