David Luiz trained with his new PSG teammates for the first time after returning from this summer's difficult World Cup campaign in Brazil.

The 26-year-old looked to be in good spirits as he joined international colleagues Thiago Silva and Lucas Moura in their first training session before the new season.

The Brazilian defender was purchased by 
the French giants in a record £50million move from Chelsea before the World 
Cup, and reported for action for the first time after the tournament.

Luiz was shown around the training 
facilities at PSG on Tuesday before being given a first chance to show 
why the French champions splashed so much cash bringing him to Paris.

The defender's World Cup in Brazil can be best described as up-and-down. Forming a solid partnership with Thiago Silva at first, when the captain was injured, the hosts fell to a 7-1 defeat by Germany in the semi-final.

The 26-year-old took the brunt of the criticism, with many questioning the decision to spend such an amount of money on the defender.

Luiz brought his calm and relaxed mood to the training ground at once, though, posing next to many club posters.

He also revealed he played his first European game against club legend Pauleta.

Argetina forward Ezequiel Lavezzi was also back in training for the first time since the World Cup.

Lavezzi has been linked with a move away from PSG this summer, with Liverpool thought to be interested, but seemed glad to be back with his club team-mates.
