Racing at speeds of up to 35mph with a skateboard in tow, Candy is a star in the world of extreme horse sports.

But just five years ago this daredevil pony was found abandoned in a muddy field in East Sussex.

Luckily, Candy - one of thousands of horses abandoned  in the UK each year - was found a new home in Norfolk by charity World Horse Welfare.

Barely able to canter, she could not do showjumping or dressage, but after learning horse boarding, in which a rider tows a skater on a board around a complex course of obstacles and turns, she no longer struggles.

New owner Rachel Simington, 25, said: 'The horse boarding has helped her become a confident young mare. We compete in horse boarding at shows all over the  country and nothing worries her now.'

The Mail on Sunday has worked to highlight the nation's 'horse crisis' and it is hoped Candy's story will inspire more people to consider rehoming these abandoned animals.

Miss Simington added: 'It has given me a bond with my pony that I could only ever have dreamt of.'
