Homicide detectives are investigating a possible sighting of Melbourne schoolgirl Siriyakorn 'Bung' Siriboon on the day she went missing three years ago.

Police revealed today on the third anniversary of the 13-year-old's disappearance that they received information a young girl was spotted in a car at Boronia, east of Melbourne, between 8.30am and 9am on the morning Bung went missing.

Bung was last seen by a neighbour leaving her Elsie Street home in Boronia and heading towards Albert Avenue shortly after 8.30am in her school uniform on June 2, 2011.

Siriyakorn 'Bung' Siriboon was last seen by a neighbour leaving her Elsie Street home in Boronia and heading towards Albert Avenue shortly after 8.30am in her school uniform on June 2, 2011

She was wearing her blue and white school uniform when she disappeared.

Police are now investigating information Bung was spotted in the rear passenger seat of a white EA to EF model Ford Falcon station wagon on Boronia Road between 8.30am and 9am on June 2.

The female was described as being of Asian appearance, in her early to mid teens and was wearing a light-coloured, collared shirt and a dark blue v-neck jumper.

The man driving the car was Caucasian, in his late 50s or early 60s, wearing a blue singlet, with a tattooed left arm and a 'rock and roll styled hairdo'.

'The witness stopped at the traffic lights next to the car and found the scenario 'odd', according to police.

Police said the car was sighted at traffic lights in Boronia Road, facing east at the intersection of Floriston Road, just east of Dorset Road. It was then seen travelling east along Boronia Road and continued straight through the roundabout at Albert Road.

Homicide Squad Detective Inspector John Potter said that while investigators have not been able to confirm the girl in the car was Bung, it's a lead police are desperate to follow up.

'The sighting may well be completely innocent, but it is relevant to us and we need to investigate it,' Det Insp Potter said.

He said police had known about the car sighting for some time, but had chosen to publicly release it on the third anniversary of Bung's disappearance to jog people's memories.

'Itâ€™s now been three years since Bung left home and failed to arrive at school that day and has not been seen or heard from since,' he said.

Monday marks the third anniversary of Bung's disappearance. She was last spotted wearing her blue and white school uniform when she disappeared

More than 1,000 homes were door-knocked and at least 1,200 leads closely examined as police tried to solve the mystery.

But Taskforce Puma, which was set up four months after her disappearance, was shut down last year as the leads dried up.

Det Insp Potter said police were 'desperate' to provide Bung's family with some answers.

'We continue to hold grave fears for her safety,' he said.

Bung is described as being of Thai origin, approximately 154cm tall, thin build with long dark hair and brown eyes.

A $1 million reward is on offer for information leading to her being found.

Anyone with fresh information about the disappearance of Bung Siriboon is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or visit www.crimestoppers.com.au.

Bung's parents Vanidda Siriyakorn and Fred Patterson announced a $1 million reward for information leading to an arrest
