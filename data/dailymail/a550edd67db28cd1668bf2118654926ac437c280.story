Adam Gemili lined up in the 100 metres final at the Commonwealth Games, shook his shoulders and threw the crowd his trademark beaming smile, in the middle of a row of bulging biceps and straining sinews.

The camera panned to his right where the towering Jamaican Kemar Bailey-Cole, standing a head taller than Gemili at 6ft 4in, clapped his hands and pointed to the name on his stomach. Next along was Jason Livermore, another Jamaican with a chest like a Greek god.

In a field of raw muscle — poised to create an explosion of power — the British sprinter looked, well, small at 5ft 11in.

Adam Gemili won two Commonwealth silver medals and two European Championship golds this summer

‘No Abs Adam is one of my nicknames among the British athletes,’ Gemili jokes, as we discuss his successful summer which saw him win two Commonwealth sprint silver medals and two European Championship golds.

‘It was an in-house joke with my training group and then others started making comments. We started training in hot countries and everyone takes their tops off, or on the physio beds, you start to notice who has abs and who hasn’t. Some of the GB guys who sprint — Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, Dwain Chambers, James Dasaolu, Richard Kilty — they’re ripped and I’m not, really.’

During the photoshoot preceding this interview, Gemili messes around by pulling the skin tight around his stomach. And in an Instagram account video that Gemili posted to show him taking part in the Ice Bucket Challenge to raise money for the Motor Neurone Disease Association, he drew on abdominal muscles with a marker pen before pouring the freezing water over himself.

Does it bother him that his fellow sprinters are often much bigger?

‘They are beasts,’ he admits. ‘For some people their size can matter a lot. I could very well get on the start line, look at the other guys and think, “Oh my god. They’re much bigger and more powerful than me”. But I’m able to move my body the speed that I move it being this size and I think as I get older I’ll get bigger and stronger — maybe not as big as these guys are naturally, but I’ll be able to run quicker.

‘Physically, I’m not a stereotypical sprinter. I’m not big with biceps bulging everywhere.’

What Gemili does possess, however, is a glorious technique, one which he is still honing in the pursuit of sprint glory.

He burst on to the sprinting scene just before London 2012 by winning the World Junior Championship 100m, but it is the 200m where he is now progressing at a faster rate.

Gemili became only the second British sprinter to run under 20 seconds when he recorded 19.98 in the 2013 Moscow World Championships semi-finals and he now has in his sights John Regis’s 19.87, the British record set 20 years ago.

Sprint legend Michael Johnson, the former 200m world record holder, described Gemili’s technique as ‘phenomenal’ and ‘almost perfect’ when he was just 18.

Three years on and the Briton at times mirrors Johnson’s upright style, straight back and legs pumping rapidly. ‘As a sprinter there are a couple of different types of ways to run,’ Gemili explains. ‘My natural endurance comes from football. I’m not the biggest of guys and I haven’t got the biggest stride length, but my turnover is good so I can keep my legs moving and that’s how I run.

‘That’s how Michael Johnson ran. He was very relaxed and kept his legs turning over. He’s got a unique style. I try to get myself tall, it’s what you’re meant to do. If people are comparing me to Michael Johnson that’s not a bad comparison to have. I don’t mind that at all.’

Gemili still has a long way to go before surpassing the American’s previous world record of 19.32 and even further to get within touching distance of current champion Usain Bolt’s 19.19. 

Yet spectators often forget he is still only 21 and sprinters do not usually reach their peak until at least their mid-20s. The two European Championship golds in Zurich — in the 200m, where he matched his personal best, and 4x100m relay — and Commonwealth silvers in the 100m and 4x100m relay in Glasgow, are stepping stones on that path.

Gemili adds: ‘When I ran 19.98 at the European Championships it was cold, 10 o’clock at night, into a minus 1.6 wind. All in all, if you flip that wind around and make it a nice sunny day, I can see that time being a tenth of a second or more quicker.’

That is still, in sprinting terms, light years away from Bolt’s world record but, although Gemili may lack the abs, he certainly does not lack the confidence to be a world-class sprinter.

‘If you never think you can reach those levels, you shouldn’t be a sprinter,’ he says. ‘If you come to the sport thinking you’ll never run near to those times, why are you bothering? You’ve got to have that belief.

‘Bolt is unique. There won’t be anyone like him for a long time, but he’s set the bar and it’s up to us to try to touch it. That’s what I’m doing, trying to stick to him as closely as I can, then maybe one day beat him.

‘He has been beaten. Justin Gatlin has beaten him, Tyson Gay has beaten him, Yohan Blake has beaten him. Everyone is human.’

But Gemili, who is funded partly by the National Lottery, will do it his way. In the sprint cauldron of muscle, tension, flexing, swaggering and testosterone, he is merely concentrating on himself.

‘In the off-season I’ve got to be more careful because if I even so much as look at a cake I put on a pound of fat,’ he says bursting into laughter.

It is nice to know that some athletes suffer the same woes as the rest of us.

As well as funding the Road to Rio athletes, every week, National Lottery players raise over £33 million for arts, heritage, charity, community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities. Find out where your money goes at www.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk.
