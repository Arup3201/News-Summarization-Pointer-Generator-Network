A police force is suing its former chief constable for nearly £500,000 after he was sacked for gross misconduct.

Cleveland Police is trying to reclaim salary and bonuses paid to Sean Price, who was dismissed last October after being found guilty of asking a colleague to inquire about a job for the former police authority chairman’s daughter and subsequently lying about it.

Mr Price was the first chief constable to be sacked in 35 years.

Months later his wife, Heather Eastwood, 41, resigned as a detective chief inspector with the same force after failing to tell superiors she had been arrested on a drunk and disorderly charge.

Now court papers reveal that  Mr Price, 55, is facing a claim that some payments he received after  his appointment in 2003 until his suspension in 2011 were unlawful.

They say some parts of the salary package were, in effect, illegal because they breached Home Office guidelines on police pay.

When Mr Price started the job, Cleveland Police Authority – which has since been disbanded – approved a salary of £125,000, making him  one of the country’s highest-paid police chiefs.

By the time he was suspended,  Mr Price’s remuneration had risen  to nearly £200,000, with allowances including a £50,000 ‘retention package’ and a £24,000 ‘honorarium’ for cutting crime.

When he was fired, he took a pension pot thought to be worth about £60,000 a year.

The force is seeking to claw back £330,000 from wages and bonuses paid, plus interest amounting to more than £100,000 from when the claim was first submitted to the High Court in Leeds.

Mr Price, who has strongly denied the claims, is currently on police bail as inquiries continue into corruption allegations linked to the former police authority.

In March, Cleveland’s former deputy chief constable Derek Bonnard was dismissed for gross misconduct on six counts, including obstructing a criminal investigation and misusing public funds.
