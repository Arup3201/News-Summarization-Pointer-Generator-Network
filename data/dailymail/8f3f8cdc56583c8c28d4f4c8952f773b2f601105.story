David Ospina has posed in his new all-black Arsenal goalkeeper's strip after finalising the £3.2million move to the Emirates that he describes as a 'dream come true'.

The 25-year-old goalkeeper cemented the interest of Arsene Wenger after impressive performances for Colombia as they reached the quarter finals at the World Cup.

He then completed the transfer from Nice on Sunday and will be in north London long-term after signing a four-year deal.

Number to come: Ospina will be pushing for Wojciech Szczesny's starting spot

Long-term: Ospina signed a four-year deal at the Emirates after impressing for Colombia at the World Cup

Colombian goalkeeping legend Rene Higuita took to Twitter to congratulate his young countryman on his arrival in the Premier League.

'I know you and I know you will do an excellent job @Arsenal What great news brother,' Higuia wrote.

Ospina is set to push Wojciech Szczesny for the No 1 shirt this season with Wenger confirming he is not the Poland keeper's support act and will start if he proves he's the best man for the job.

The new man in is showing due respect to his team-mate and training partner Szczesny.

'He is a great goalkeeper, very skilful,' Ospina told Arsenal.com. 'He has been a regular at a top side like Arsenal, so he is quality. We also have the Argentine goalkeeper Damien Martinez. They are both young players but very experienced.'

After the deal was completed Wenger said: 'David Ospina is an excellent goalkeeper, with good experience and a proven record of performing with Nice and Colombia.'

'He will add strength to our squad and we are very pleased that he will be joining us.'

The keeper is expected to take the field for his new club during next weekend's Emirates Cup friendly tournament in which the Gunners face Benfica and Monaco.

After his signing, Ospina posted: 'The race closes with a wonderful Nice cycle and a dream fulfilled upon arrival at Arsenal. Thank you Nissarts, Go Gunners'.
