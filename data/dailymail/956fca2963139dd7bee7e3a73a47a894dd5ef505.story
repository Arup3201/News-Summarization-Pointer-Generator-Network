Victim: Delfino Mora, 62, was found unconscious in an alley in Chicago last Tuesday. He died in hospital the next day as a result of blunt head trauma

Three teenagers were playing a game called 'Pick'em out and Knock'em dead' when they beat a father of twelve to death then posted the footage on Facebook, prosecutors said today.

Delfino Mora was found unconscious in an alley in Chicago, Illinois, last Tuesday morning. He died in hospital the next day as a result of blunt head trauma.

Malik Jones, 16, Nicholas Ayala, 17, and Anthony Malcolm, 18, have each been charged with first-degree murder and robbery.

Jones had spotted Mr Mora and decided to attack him, State Attorney Terry Clancy told a bail hearing today.

The teen is said to have told his friends: ' 'I think I'm gonna knock out this ******' and started recording on his phone.

Police claim that Ayala and Malcolm took turns using a mobile phone to record the fatal assault on Mr Mora, who didn't have full use of his right arm after a workplace accident 15 years ago.

The footage was then uploaded to Jones' Facebook account, it is claimed.

Jones, a suspected gang member who is being charged as an adult, appeared in court yesterday and was ordered to be held without bail. His preliminary hearing is scheduled for later today.

While prosecutors did not identify his two accomplices by name, they detailed how the attack allegedly took place.

Jones is said to have have handed his 
phone to his co-defendants and then approached Mr Mora in an alley in 
the Des Plaines area of the city at around 5am last Tuesday.

He ordered his victim to empty his pockets and then punched him in the jaw, prosecutors said. Mr Mora fell and hit his head on concrete.Â 

Jones told police he had hit Mr Mora, who is originally from Mexico, the court was told.

A passer-by found Mr Mora with blood on his face and vomit next to his head about three hours later.

The attack was recorded on Jones' mobile phone and the footage was placed on his Facebook account.

A witness who knows Jones watched the video and passed it on. It eventually reached a co-worker of Mr Mora's son, who called the police.

Jones was arrested on Saturday, while Ayala and Malcolm were apprehended yesterday and are due in court for an initial hearing later today.

Mr Mora's youngest child Angelica, 17, told the Chicago Tribune: 'It feels to us like they're making fun of my dad because he couldn't defend himself.

'They think posting a violent video makes them tough. It's like they want to get famous.'

Mr Mora was father to six girls and six boys, who range in age from 17 to 40, and was also a grandfather.

The family is planning to take his body back to Mexico to be buried later this week.
