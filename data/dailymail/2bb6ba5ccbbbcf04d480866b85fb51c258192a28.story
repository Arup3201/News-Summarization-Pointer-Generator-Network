Rarely a week goes by without Katie Hopkins lashing out at an unsuspecting member of the public. 

This time, the reality star has taken aim at the newsreader Kate Silverton in her column for The Sun. 

The journalist has recently given birth to her second child and mentioned in the media some of the problems her female friends had been having with getting pregnant in their early forties.

Kate told the Evening Standard: 'There is a huge amount of pressure for the modern couple. 

'You are going to have it even tougher because you will see what has happened with women who delay having children because we have been working so hard or haven’t found the right partner that you will think, ‘hang on a minute, is it better to have my children older or younger?'

'A lot of women I know are having huge difficulty trying to conceive.' 

The 44-year-old hasn't returned to full-time work since the birth of her second child Wilbur in June, preferring instead to make the most of her time with her young family as possible.

But in the same interview, Kate mentioned that she had previously been so tied to a job commitment that when her husband was unable to come home to look after her their daughter Clemency one night, she took the child with her to the event she was giving a speech at. 

She said: 'I probably create a load of havoc in my wake bringing my children to work but if you are calm the baby is calm — it can be done. It challenges this perception that children should not be seen.' 

The television presenter used the example to question what needs to be done in order for women to feel they can juggle having children at an earlier age with a career. 

Katie claimed that Kate's job is nothing like the work commitments of the normal working woman

But Katie Hopkins this morning took offence to these comments in her newspaper column for The Sun. 

The 39 year old claimed that Kate's job is nothing like the work commitments of the normal working woman and that it would be extremely difficult for many workplaces to allow children. 

Katie said: 'This is all very well if your job is turning up to show off your impressive teeth and angular jaw.

'How about your local GP? Her three-year-old in the surgery may not be as welcome.

'I love it when mums start handing out advice and I look forward to seeing Kate reading the news with a yelling baby on her lap and a bit of milky sick on her shoulder.' 

It isn't the only time in recent weeks that Katie has hit out at a celebrity over topics relating to motherhood. 

In September she poked fun at Katie Price's decision to call her daughter Bunny. 

Katie tweeted: 'Bunny? BUNNY?! Makes sense I guess, given your dad was going at it like a rabbit with all of mums mates.'
