The world's ocean floor is littered with around 3 million shipwrecks according to the United Nations.

But one of the most captivating is in a pool of water much smaller - the bottom of an Ontario lake.

Shimmering in the clear blue water just twenty feet below the surface lies the Sweepstakes, a 19th century boat.

Haunting: The hull of Sweepstakes lies just twenty feet below clear blue water of Ontario lake where it sank in 1885

Ending: She was towed to the head of Big Tub Harbour to be repaired in September of 1885 however it was determined that the damage was too extensive to be repaired

Despite sinking in 1885, she still holds an attraction for divers and tourists in the Fathom Five National Marine Park.

Sweepstakes was a Canadian schooner built in Burlington, Ontario in 1867.

At 218 gross tonnes, she was 119' long with a 23' beam and a 10' depth of hold.

The end came for Sweepstakes in the summer of 1885 when she was hauling coal near Cove Island and her hull was damaged.

Damaged: The Sweepstakes sustained hull damage on shoals near Cove Island, off shore of Tobermory while hauling coal late in the summer of 1885

Sunk: A decision was made to sink her and she was stripped of anything of value before being allowed to travel to the bottom of the seabed

Protection: Metal bars are now throughout the inside of her hull, these have been installed by Parks Canada to reinforce the hull and deck

Draw: Despite sinking in 1885, she still holds an attraction for divers and tourists in the Fathom Five National Marine Park

Discovery:  She is considered one of the best preserved 19th-century great lakes schooners to ever be discovered

She was towed to the head of Big Tub Harbour to 
be repaired, but the damage proved too extensive to make a repair economically viable.

A decision was made to sink her and she was stripped of anything of
 value before being allowed to travel to the bottom of the seabed.

Although she deteriorates more each year she is considered one of the best preserved 19th-century great lakes schooners to ever be discovered

Metal bars are now throughout the inside
 of her hull, these have been installed by Parks Canada to reinforce the
 hull and deck.

There is also a wire fence to stop divers going into the wreckage in an attempt to preserve the shipwreck.

10. RMS Rhone: The RMS Rhone was a British packet ship owned by the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. She was wrecked off the coast of Salt Island in the British Virgin Islands on 29 October 1867 during a hurricane with the loss of approximately 123 lives.

9. SS Thistlegorm: In 1941, this British Merchant Navy ship was sunk by a German bomb in the Egyptian Red Sea. Trucks, motorcycles, rifles, and many other items can be found when exploring the ship’s holds.

8. SS Yongala: This 110 metre long ship is one of the 
largest shipwrecks and is visited by over 10,000 divers every year due 
to the vast array of marine life. When this passenger ship got hit by a cyclone on March 23, 1911, it sank and all 122 passengers perished in the waters off the coast of Cape Bowling Green, Australia. 

7. Rainbow Warrior: This Greenpeace-owned ship was intended to lead a protest against French nuclear testing in French Polynesia. However, on July 10, 1985, French intelligence agents sabotaged these plans by detonating two bombs and sinking the ship.  The wreck of the Rainbow Warrior was refloated on 21 August 1985 , but was too damaged and the vessel was scuttled in Matauri Bay in the Cavalli Islands, New Zealand in 1987.

6. SS President Coolidge: This 199 metre long luxury ocean liner sunk in 1941 when it hit a mine in the South Pacific, off the coast of Vanuatu. Coolidge is the largest, most intact and accessible wreck of World War Two.

5. Fujikawa Maru: Truk Lagoon in Micronesia is the home to many shipwrecks, including this Japanese freighter that was sunk in 1944 by a torpedo. Divers come to see the hold full of Zero fighter planes and the other assorted artifacts, including fossilized sake bottles.

4. USS Oriskany: Nicknamed Mighty O, The O-boat, and Toasted O this was one of 24 Essex-class aircraft carriers completed during or shortly after World War II for the United States Navy.  In May 2006, it was deliberately sunk in the Gulf of Mexico, 37 km off the coast of Pensacola, Florida. At 275 meters long, it is the world’s largest artificial reef.

3. L.R. Doty: This wooden steamship disappeared near Milwaukee, Wisconsin on October 25, 1898, during a violent storm on Lake Michigan. It was discovered 112 years later, on June 25, 2010.

2. Skeleton Coast:  A treasure trove of shipwrecks, this section of the Atlantic coast in Namibia is littered with the remains of thousands of ships that have wrecked due to the heavy surf and even heavier winds.

1. Whydah Galley: This 31 metre long galley was the flagship of the pirate Sam “Black Sam” Bellamy - it sank on April 26, 1717,  off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts during a storm.  The wreck was discovered in 1985, along with the thousands of artifacts on board.
