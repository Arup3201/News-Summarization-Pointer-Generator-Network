Jean Charles de Menezes, who was mistakenly shot dead by anti-terror police in July 2005

The family of the Brazilian mistakenly shot dead by anti-terror police were allegedly spied on by undercover Scotland Yard officers.

Members of the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) gathered information on relatives who were campaigning for justice following the death of Jean Charles de Menezes, 27.

His family are reported to be among at least 12 spied on by officers from the now defunct unit.

They include relatives of Cherry Groce, whose shooting by police triggered the 1985 Brixton riots, and relatives of an Asian man called Ricky Reel, 20, who died in mysterious circumstances after falling into the Thames in south west London in 1997.

The scandal-hit police unit also collated sensitive details about the family of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence during their justice campaign in the late 1990s, it emerged earlier this year.

Details of the alleged intrusion suffered by Mr de Menezes’s relatives are expected to be outlined in a hard-hitting report to be published today. It will attack undercover police units for gathering and keeping information about black justice groups that ‘served no purpose in preventing crime’.

According to Channel 4 News, Mr de Menezes’s family had their privacy breached by undercover Met officers in the aftermath of his death at Stockwell Tube station in south London in July 2005.

The electrician was shot seven times in the head by officers who mistakenly thought he was a terrorist. An inquest jury later found the Met guilty of health and safety failings.

Mr de Menezes’s family received about £100,000 compensation from the force and depending on the level of intrusion by undercover officers, could now be in line for a further payout.

Scotland Yard declined to comment last night. Channel 4 News claimed at least 12 families have been contacted by the Met to say they appear in reports and notes kept by the SDS, which was disbanded in 2008.

Today’s report by Derbyshire Chief Constable Mick Creedon will say that neither the families nor their campaign were the target of undercover officers, but that information about them was reported and retained, when it should have been discarded. Labour MP Diane Abbott said that the spying claims concerning the de Menezes family ‘fatally undermine confidence’  in the police.

Sukhdev Reel, the mother of Ricky Reel, told Channel 4 News: ‘Rather than them helping us pick up the pieces trying to find out what happened to us they were spying on us. I don’t understand it, I just feel I’ve been stripped of my dignity… I feel really angry.’

Mr Creedon was called in to lead an inquiry after a series of allegations were made about the SDS, including that officers used the identities of dead children without permission and tricked women into serious sexual relationships.

He said last night: ‘My report is very clear that criticism must be levelled at the Metropolitan Police for keeping information, which had been gathered by undercover officers, which served no purpose in preventing crime or disorder.’

A spokesman for the Jean Charles De Menezes Family Campaign said last night: ‘It begs the question – what exactly were they spying for?

‘We can only assume they were gathering information in an attempt to discredit the family’s campaign for justice in order to deflect accountability for their own failings.’
