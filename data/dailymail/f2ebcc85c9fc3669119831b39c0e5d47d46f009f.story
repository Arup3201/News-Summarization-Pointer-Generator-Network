Tiger Woods showed up at Royal Liverpool on Sunday and looked and sounded like a man with something to prove at the 143rd Open Championship this week.

One analyst after another has been pouring scorn on his preparations with their thoughts all contributing to a premise previously considered unthinkable: has the fire gone out?

Well, the fact he was in town a day earlier than expected might be considered something of an answer in itself.

But it was the sight of Tiger 
pain-free and clearly enjoying himself in the afternoon rain at 
Hoylake, and the optimistic noises he made afterwards, that might cause 
those who are ready to write him off to pause for breath.

Woods
 arrived at almost exactly the same time he did on the Saturday before 
the Open at Hoylake in 2006. Is he secretly superstitious?

Eight
 years ago he was coming off his first missed halfway cut in a major, at
 the US Open, as he came to terms with losing his father, Earl.

We
 all knew what the response would be by the time he got to Hoylake. Back
 then, the fire was overpowering, and he duly won it for his dad with 
one of the great exhibitions of links play of all time, and wept 
unashamedly on the 18th green. It was the start of seven tournament victories in a row. He was 30 and appeared invincible.

Now,
 two-time US Open champion Curtis Strange is so scornful of his chances 
he says Woods is ‘kidding himself’ if he thinks he can win.

Major concern: Tiger has endured a six-year drought since his last Major

Sir Nick Faldo is just one of 
many who wondered why he did not play in this week’s Scottish Open, 
since he has only played two competitive rounds in four months following
 his surgery.

Certainly, 
the idea Woods would rush back to play before he was ready, simply to 
appease a sponsor, as he clearly did at his own tournament in Washington
 two weeks ago where he missed the cut comfortably, would have been 
ludicrous  during his glory years. And Faldo would probably have been 
taken up on his very reasonable suggestion to play the Scottish as well.

So
 a different Woods will  undoubtedly be on show this time. During those 
eight years he has been battered by injuries, wounded by divorce, 
damaged irrevocably by scandal and blessed with two  children. How could
 things not be different?

But is there anything wrong in a 38-year-old easing his way back into competition?

Why
 wouldn’t Woods think long-term after his recent surgery and look on 
this tournament as the first major of the rest of his life?

Comeback: Woods spent months on the sideline this year after undergoing back surgery

‘This is how I used to feel when I 
played,’ beamed Woods on Saturday. ‘I had good weeks and bad weeks before 
my back surgery, but now they are all good. And it’s good to be back 
here.

'I remember some of the holes but it’s much more green this time. I
 have been out here trying to hit the ball again and as the weeks go on,
 I am only going to get stronger. I was at a point where I could not do 
anything because I could not get out of bed, and now I am completely 
pain-free.’

One thing’s for
 sure, and that is he will be given a raucous welcome by the locals, who
 are thrilled he is beginning his major comeback at the place where he 
created such indelible memories last time.

Liverpool
 is currently in thrall at the prospect of something known as the Giant 
Spectacle, an amazing show on the city’s streets that is expected to 
draw more than a  million people next week.

Thousands
 will flock to Hoylake to see Woods, but the game itself, as well as his
 fans, should welcome him back. Rather than dwelling on what’s missing, 
shouldn’t we just be glad to see him fit and healthy at this stage and 
leave the critical analysis for later?

Raring to go: Woods is determined to put in a good performance at Hoylake after months out through injury

Woods could not play last week, he 
said, because he had a vacation pre-planned with his kids. Are we really
 going to slaughter him for that?

By pure chance, I was there by the clubhouse when he got his first look at Hoylake last time.

‘Where’s
 the first tee, bud?’ he asked, cheerfully. So alongside old coach Hank 
Haney and his former caddie Steve Williams, my eight-year-old son and I 
accompanied him to the first tee.

Woods
 pulled out a three-wood on the opening hole, struck it beautifully — 
and was dismayed to see it disappear into a fairway bunker.

The
 same thing happened at the second hole. And so the strategy that would 
startle everyone at  Hoylake that week began to take shape. Over the 
parched links, Woods would use his driver just once all week.

On
 occasion he would be 70 yards behind his playing partners but he wasn’t
 to be moved from his strategy of taking the fairway bunkers out of 
play. It was a stunning demonstration of strength of mind and skill and 
it earned him a two-stroke  triumph on a total of 18 under par.

The test might be greener this 
time but even so, two-time Open champion Padraig Harrington, who visited
 Hoylake recently, sees no reason why the winning score should not be 
similar.

‘Normally, if you
 shoot a 72-hole score of a few digits under par you won’t be far away 
but that might not be the case here,’ he said. ‘This is one of those 
majors where you need to make a fast start, because a 73 or 74 will 
leave you with an awful lot of catching up to do.’

Two
 of the favoured names this week are recent winners Justin Rose and 
Graeme McDowell, who have both made their reputations winning on tough 
courses where the winning score is close to par.

If they are to prevail at  Hoylake, therefore, it might require a change of modus operandi.

A
 good weather week will surely play into the hands of the strong US 
contingent. Down the generations, Royal Liverpool has been good to the 
great Americans, with victories for Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones, as 
well as Woods.

Trouble ahead: The four hardest holes at Hoylake that could decide The Open

There would probably have been wins 
for Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson as well but for the course’s 39-year 
exile from the Open rota from 1967.

And still we haven’t mentioned the best player in the world, Adam Scott.

Is
 there another sportsman in his position who has perfected the art of 
staying under the radar quite as well as the gentle Aussie?

Scott
 has not played since the US Open a month ago, but he pulled the same 
trick before winning the  Masters last year, so no-one should have too 
many concerns in terms of rust.

The
 last three winners of the Claret Jug — Darren Clarke, Ernie Els and 
Phil Mickelson — were all aged 42 or 43 at the time of their wins and it
 would come as no surprise if the trend continued.

Warming up: The 2013 US Open winner Justin Rose will fancy his chances at Hoylake

Focused: Rory McIlroy will be one of the favourites when The Open starts on Thursday

And 41-year-old Lee Westwood will be the fervent hope of many.

At
 the other end of the career scale, 25-year-old Rory McIlroy will 
probably start favourite, and deservedly so after showing at Royal 
Aberdeen — on Thursday at least — how much he has learned about links 
golf.

But the start of the
 week, at least, will be dominated by one man who turned up early at 
Hoylake  on Sunday, as if to show he means business.

Yes,
 it’s true, he’s not the Tiger Woods of old. But he’s still Tiger Woods,
 and that alone is enough to give this major championship the frisson of
 anticipation missing from the Masters and the US Open.
