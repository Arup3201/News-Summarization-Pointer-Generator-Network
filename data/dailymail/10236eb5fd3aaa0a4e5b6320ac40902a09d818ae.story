North Korea has urged Panama to release a ship and its crew caught smuggling arms from Cuba to the secretive state.

Panama stopped the ship last week and seized missiles and fighter jets found buried under bags of sugar after a stand-off with the North Korean crew.

The 35 men, who have been charged with trafficking undeclared arms, tried to resist arrest while the captain had a heart attack and attempted to slit his own throat.

North Korea has demanded that the Chong Chon Gang and its 35-strong crew be released from Panama, where the ship was stopped and found to be carrying military equipment

Cuba has said that the military equipment found buried under sacks of sugar on the ship consisted of 'obsolete' weapons that were going to be repaired in North Korea and returned to the island

Panama has called in the United Nations for help in examining the cargo

Authorities discovered missile 
equipment, MiG fighter jets and other arms aboard the Chong Chon Gang, which was stopped in the Panama Canal.

Cuba admitted it owned what it called 'obsolete' Soviet-era weapons and said they would be returned to the Caribbean island once they had been repaired.

'This cargo is nothing but ageing 
weapons, which are to send back to Cuba after overhauling them according
to a legitimate contract,' said a North Korean foreign ministry spokesman, according to state news agency KCNA.

Panama has called in the United Nations Security Council, Colombia and Britain to help search the ship, with five U.N. investigators expected to arrive in the country next month once the vessel has been unloaded.

North Korea is barred by U.N. sanctions from importing sophisticated weapons or missiles
for flouting measures aimed at curbing its nuclear weapons program.

Ban Ki-moon, U.N. Secretary-General, yesterday praised Panama for its actions and said the sanctions committee would take up the issue.

The 14,000-tonne ship is being searched by 350 police and border patrol officials.

The crew set the vessel's electrical system on fire to disable it, which means the unloading process could take up to ten days, a Panamanian foreign ministry spokesman said.

Military equipment was found inside containers on the Chong Chon Gang, which is being searched by investigators

The ship's cargo, bound for North Korea, included missiles, two MiG-21 jet fighters and 15 spare engines

The Chong Chon Gang could take up to ten days to unload, officials said, with the task made more difficult because the crew burned the electrical system before their arrests

Two more containers with suspected arms have been found on the ship in addition to the two already discovered.

Access points to the ship's storage 
areas were all 'completely blocked' in breach of international 
regulations when Panamanian officials boarded it, security minister Jose Raul Mulino said.

Cuba said the weapons on the 
ship included two anti-aircraft missile batteries, nine disassembled 
rockets, two MiG-21 fighter jets, and 15 MiG-21 engines, all Soviet-era 
military weaponry built in the middle of the last century.

North Korea would breach the arms embargo imposed by the U.N. by carrying out repairs.

Britain's U.N. Ambassador, Mark Lyall Grant, said the ship appeared to have violated the U.N. arms embargo.

One senior U.S. lawmaker called the matter a 'grave violation of international treaties', while officials said Washington would be speaking to Cuba about the ship.

North Korea said the 'ageing weapons' were to be repaired and returned to Cuba under a legitimate contract

Panama's president Ricardo Martinelli announced the ship had been detained through Twitter

Robert 
Menendez, a Democratic lawmaker and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said: 'Weapons transfers from 
one communist regime to another hidden under sacks of sugar are not 
accidental ... and reinforces the necessity that Cuba remain on the 
State Department's list of countries that sponsor state terrorism.'

Talks between the two countries on migration went ahead as planned yesterday. The U.S. has been asked to provide technical assistance by Panama.

Panama's foreign minister Fernando Nunez Fabrega said his country has no problem with Cuba but was obliged to inspect the North Korean ship under U.N. rules.

A 2009 resolution says the embargo applies to 'all arms and related material, as well as to financial transactions, technical training, advice, services or assistance related to the provision, manufacture, maintenance or use of such arms, except for small arms and light weapons.'

Panamanian President Ricardo 
Martinelli tweeted a photo showing a green tube that appears to be a 
horizontal antenna for the SNR-75 'Fan Song' radar, which is used to 
guide missiles fired by the SA-2 air-defense system found in former 
Warsaw Pact and Soviet-allied nations, said Neil Ashdown, an analyst for
IHS Jane's Intelligence.

Controversy: Cuba has said missiles found buried under sacks of sugar on a ship bound for North Korea were being sent to the secretive state to be repaired

Speaking out: The Caribbean nation admitted last night that it owned the military equipment and said it was due to be returned to the island once repairs had been completed

'It
is possible that this could be being sent to North Korea to update its 
high-altitude air-defense capabilities,' Mr Ashdown said.

Martinelli
said his officials originally thought drugs could be aboard the ship 
and tried to contact the Chong Chon Gang's crew, who did not respond.

'Panama
being a neutral country, a country in peace, that doesn't like war, we 
feel very worried about this military material,' he said.

IHS Fairplay, a maritime news publication which monitors vessels' movement, said it had found that another ship bearing the North Korean flag had made a similar journey last year.

The O Un Chong Nyon Ho docked in Havana last May, it said.

Hal Klepak, a history professor at the Royal Military College of Canada, said Cuba's weapons and equipment were 'of staggeringly old vintage'.

He said the Pentagon had long since written off the island as a military threat.

Since Cuba's military doctrine was designed to deter any attack, it needs to maintain the arms it has, he added.

'Cuba cannot afford to buy anything newer and does not have repair facilities of its own for such needs,' he said.

'Thus if it is not to scrap, for example, the aircraft entirely, it must repair and potentially update them in some areas.'

In early July, a top North Korean general, Kim Kyok Sik, visited Cuba and met counterparts on the island.

The
Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma said he was also received by 
President Raul Castro, and the two had an 'exchange about the historical
ties that unite the two nations and the common will to continue 
strengthening them.'

The meetings were held behind closed doors, and there has been no detailed account of their discussions.

'After
this incident there should be renewed focus on North Korean-Cuban 
links,' said Hugh Griffiths, an arms trafficking expert at the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute.

Griffiths said his institute told the U.N. this year that it had 
uncovered evidence of a flight from Cuba to North Korea that travelled 
via central Africa.

'Given 
the history of North Korea, Cuban military cooperation and now this 
latest seizure, we find this flight more interesting,' he said.Â 

The Chong Chon Gang has a history of 
being detained on suspicion of trafficking drugs and ammunition, 
Griffiths said.

Lloyd's List Intelligence said the 34-year-old ship, 
which is registered to the Pyongyang-based Chongchongang Shipping 
Company, 'has a long history of detentions for safety deficiencies and 
other undeclared reasons.'

Griffiths
said the Chong Chon Gang was stopped in 2010 in the Ukraine and was 
attacked by pirates 400 miles off the coast of Somalia 
in 2009.

Griffiths' 
institute has also been interested in the ship because of a 2009 stop it
made in Tartus - a Syrian port city hosting a Russian naval base.
