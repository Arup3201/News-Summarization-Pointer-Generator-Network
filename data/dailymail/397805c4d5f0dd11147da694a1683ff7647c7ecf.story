Sir Richard Branson last night attacked an advert for Virgin Mobile US that appears to make light of rape.

The online advert shows a man standing behind a woman and covering her eyes with his hand before giving her a small present. The caption reads: ‘The gift of Christmas surprise. Necklace? Or chloroform?’

The advert provoked a furious reaction from Twitter users, who described it as ‘disgusting’ and ‘totally unacceptable’.

Joke: The advert featured a picture of a man behind a woman with his hand in front of her eyes, giving her a small red box, and the caption read: 'The gift of Christmas surprise. Necklace? Or chloroform?'

Virgin Group founder Sir Richard, 62, wrote on his blog: ‘Having just seen, for the first time, the Virgin Mobile US advert which has upset many today, I agree it is ill-judged.

‘Although I don’t own the company [it is owned by a US  firm, Sprint Nextel], it carries our brand.

‘I will speak to the team there, make my thoughts clear and see what can be done about it.’

He later added: ‘They acknowledge a dreadful mistake was made. The advert will be withdrawn within the hour, never to be seen again.’

Sir Richard - a father-of-two who was 
born in 1950, founded Virgin in 1970 and has a net worth of £2.6billion -
admitted to his 2.7million followers on Twitter that the advert was 
'pretty ill-judged'.

Twitter users roundly criticised the 
advert, describing it as 'disgusting' and 'a publicity disaster waiting 
to happen' - and @Becca_DP said on the website: '"Ill-judged" is a 
bit of an understatement'.

People had earlier been campaigning for 
the company to take down the advert, with journalist Sally Churchward 
saying on Twitter: 'Is a rape "joke" really part of your Christmas 
campaign?'

Charity project worker Sue Conway added: 'Using rape or domestic violence jokes to sell products (is) totally unacceptable'.

Chloroform is an obsolete anaesthetic, although it is still available and used as an industrial strength cleaner - and has been employed by criminals in the past to knock out victims.

A 35-year-old husband was jailed for eight years October 2011 after using chloroform to knock out his virgin wife - a Bangladeshi immigrant who was 21 at the time - and rape her in east London.
