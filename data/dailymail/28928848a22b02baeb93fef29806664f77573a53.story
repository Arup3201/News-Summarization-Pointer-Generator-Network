Britain's former ambassador to Afghanistan yesterday spoke of his ‘heartbreak’ at the sight of wounded soldiers taking part in the Paralympic Games’ opening ceremony.

Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles accused the Government of ‘betraying’ those who served in Afghanistan, because its plan to pull out troops in 2014 would hand large parts of the country to the Taliban.

He said it was painful to watch the soldiers bear their horrific injuries so bravely.

Eight wounded servicemen and women are in Britain’s Paralympic team, and several others were involved in the torch relay.

Sir Sherard, who was Britain’s ambassador in Kabul until June 2010, said that he had been particularly moved by the high-profile involvement of Captain Harry Parker and Marine Joe Townsend, who both lost both legs in separate bomb blasts in Afghanistan.

He said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘What breaks my heart is when I saw Captain Harry Parker running down Whitehall carrying the Olympic flame last night and Marine Joe Townsend going into the Olympic stadium also carrying the torch.

‘We are betraying them because we – the diplomats, the politicians, the civil servants – have failed to accompany a perfectly sensible military tactical campaign with a serious political strategy.’

Sir Sherard said politicians on both sides of the Atlantic had failed to use the results of the military effort to develop a lasting peace process in Afghanistan.

He said there was a real danger that the fragile gains made in the country would quickly evaporate when British and American troops leave in 2014.

He added: ‘What we are doing, 
essentially, is cultivating an allotment in a jungle, and the question 
is what happens when the gardeners leave?’

Sir
Sherard said that al Qaeda had been ‘virtually eliminated’ in 
Afghanistan but that politicians had failed to invest the will and 
resources needed to ‘finish the job’.

He
said British troops had done a superb job, but added: ‘We’re in danger 
of betraying their legacy, betraying their courage, unless the 
politicians, the diplomats, do their job, which is to broker a serious 
solution inside Afghanistan and involving all the countries of the 
region.’

Barack Obama and David Cameron have both committed to withdrawing all combat troops from Afghanistan by 2014.

Critics,
including some in the military, accuse the two leaders of acting for 
domestic political purposes and warn that premature withdrawal from 
Afghanistan will hand control over large parts of the country to the 
Taliban.

Sir Sherard called on the US to broker talks with all the main parties in Afghanistan, including the Taliban, along with talks involving the country’s neighbours, particularly Pakistan.

But he conceded this was unlikely ahead of November’s US elections as there were ‘no votes in being portrayed talking to the Taliban’.

Ministers insist that by 2014 the Afghan security forces will be fully trained and capable of dealing with the Taliban by themselves.

But Colonel Richard Kemp, a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, also yesterday accused politicians of failing to match the commitment of the troops.

He said that soldiers did not talk of ‘betrayal’, but added: ‘I think there have been some very serious shortcomings politically.’

Colonel Kemp said the West had failed to prevent the Afghan government sliding into the ‘depths of corruption’.

And he said it was extraordinary that Pakistan had been allowed to supply ‘such strong levels of support to the Taliban’.
