Two British brothers were attacked by a knife-wielding holidaymaker in a row over sunbeds at a five-star hotel in Turkey.

Danny and Ben Slade, from Ashford, Surrey, were left needing hospital treatment after the incident during a family break at the Isis Hotel and Spa.

The row broke out after they reserved sunbeds at the hotel in the popular tourist resort of Bodrum.

Moments before the attack, the man shouted at brothers Ben, 22, and Danny, 26, and girlfriend Lauren Anshaw, 24, who were on a break with their parents Daniel, 50, and Mary, 49.

Ben told the man to take two of the sunbeds as he was causing such a disturbance – and his father alerted the hotel security.

The attacker then returned with a knife, stabbing Ben in the arms and legs – before Danny jumped in to save him, and got stabbed in the chest.

The man screamed ‘I'm killing you’ in front of horrified sunbathers and children.

Ben had to undergo life-saving surgery for wounds to his arms, legs and feet, and Danny narrowly escaped death as the knife missed his heart and lungs by just 2cm.

Quick-thinking Danny leaped in the hotel pool to escape, while Ben hid in a bush.

Ben said: ‘I had laid down on the sunbed after the guy walked off when I heard my brother's girlfriend screaming my name.

‘I opened my eyes and looked up and saw this knife glinting in the light.

‘I had never been in any situation like that in my life.

‘I then fell over another sunbed and he stabbed me in the leg. While this was going on he was telling me “I'm killing you”.

‘My brother saved my life without a doubt. I got stabbed five times.’

Architect Danny said: ‘It was like being in a horror film. I feel lucky to be alive.’

The family has now returned home, where Mary said: ‘We had a right time of it, it's just something you would never expect to happen.’

‘Seeing my children like that was just my worst nightmare. I just went into shock.

‘I saw Danny first of all, there was blood everywhere. He told me “I think he's killed Ben”. It was terrible.

‘It's going to stay with us for the rest of our lives.’

The Isis Hotel and Spa declined to comment and a man was arrested and bailed by local police.
