A mother with postnatal depression killed her two babies because she had delusions that they would be seized by social services, a court heard yesterday.

Jewellery designer Felicia Boots, 35, suffocated her ten-week-old son Mason and 14-month-old daughter Lily days after the family had moved into a new £1.4million home in an area known as Nappy Valley because it is popular with young, rich families. She has been detained in a mental hospital after the judge said prison would be 'wholly inappropriate'.

Today a family friend revealed Boots tragic history as he told how her brother had committed suicide four years ago.

George McRae, who lives near Boots’ parents Dave and Debbie Sinclair in Ontario, Canada, said there was a history of depression in the family. He said: 'Something should have been done to help her sooner. You notice things about people, you know something is wrong.'

McRae, who lives near Boots’ parents Dave and Debbie Sinclair in Ontario, Canada, said her brother Scott Sinclair had apparently hanged himself four years ago after moving to Toronto and abandoning his religion.In a tragic twist, he said Boots had branded the act “selfish” at the time telling them: 'Now my kids will never know their uncle.'Mr McRae told the London Evening Standard: 'Felicia told us that he had killed himself. She said he didn’t like having this religion jammed down his throat.'He added that Mr Sinclair had also suffered from depression and was on medication before his death.Boots had also had to deal with the break-down of her first marriage to Dale Morgan.The couple had married while she was still a teenager and it did not last long, but she was reportedly devastated after the split.

Yesterday Mrs Boots wept as she admitted two charges of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Her not guilty plea to two murder charges was accepted by prosecutor Ed Brown QC.

Her
 husband, who was in court, is standing by his wife. Mr Brown said Mr 
Boots had written ‘a moving statement supportive of his wife in very 
sympathetic terms’.

Boots' husband Jeffery, an investment
 banker, returned home that evening to find the house in darkness and 
his wife sitting on the stairs, hugging herself.

She
 had tried to kill herself but inflicted only superficial damage to her 
neck. Woman suffering postnatal depression has admitted killing her two 
babies who were then discovered dead by their father at the family's 
home.

He ran upstairs and found their children lying side by side on the floor of a walk-in wardrobe in the master bedroom of the semi-detached house in Wandsworth, south-west London. They had apparently been strangled with one of his ties, the Old Bailey heard.

Mr Boots, 35, was heard wailing: ‘My lovely son, my beautiful daughter. They have gone. Help me, help me, help me.’

His wife had been diagnosed with postnatal depression after the birth of both children. She had been prescribed antidepressant medication and her condition outwardly appeared to be improving.

Hours before she killed her children she sent a photograph taken on her mobile phone of Lily to her husband, who took this as a sign that she was feeling better.

He was unaware that she had stopped taking the medication because she was worried about its side effects while breast feeding despite reassurances from her doctor.

Computer records show she made a series of Google searches about her concerns in the preceding weeks.

Felicia Boots counsel read a letter to the court from the mother, who said that she would never forget the events of May 9 - the day she killed her children.

It read: 'May 9, 2012, is a day I will be eternally sorry for.

'It should never have happened.

'It troubles me more than anyone will
 ever know.

'Part of me will always be missing.

'I am a good person.

'I am a
 good mum and I never meant any of this to happen.

'I am truly sorry.'

In a note found next to the bodies she ‘questioned how she could have done such a thing’. She wrote how ‘she was scared and sorry’ and that her ‘life started to fall apart a few weeks before’.

Her husband called the emergency services but paramedics were unable to save the children.

His wife, who was ‘unsteady and weak on her feet’, was arrested.

Mr Boots told officers at the scene that his wife was a good mother and he ‘could not believe that she would do such a thing’.

Mr Justice Fulford said a prison sentence would be ‘wholly inappropriate in this case’. He ordered that she be detained at a mental health unit until doctors deem her fit for release. ‘This is an almost indescribably sad case,’ said the judge.

‘Although the roots of Mrs Boots’s actions were profoundly tragic given the loss of two such young lives, what occurred was not what most people would regard as criminal activity.

‘I unreservedly accept that what the defendant did to the two children she and her husband loved and nurtured, was solely the result of psychological and bio-physiological forces that were beyond her control.

Mr Justice Fulford said: 'I unreservedly accept that what she did 
to the two children, that she and her husband loved and nurtured, were 
the results of physical and biological factors beyond her control'

‘This has always been a happy family. This is someone who delighted in 
being a mother and she was good at it.

'This case is the polar opposite 
of the appalling incidents of child neglect and cruelty that sometimes 
come before the courts.’

Canada-born Mrs Boots had married a fellow Jehovah’s Witness shortly 
after she left high school but the marriage failed when she left the 
church.

She married Mr Boots in August 2007 and the couple moved to the 
UK in 2008.

Although most women have the ‘baby blues’ for a short time, one in ten 
goes on to suffer full-blown clinical depression which is unlikely to 
improve without treatment.

Four women in every 1,000 giving birth have to be admitted to hospital,

Jeff Boots and his wife Felicia Boots were a 'contented couple'. Mrs Boots had begun to suffer from depression and left a note saying she could not explain why she had killed her children

Postnatal depression typically develops in the first one to two months after childbirth, but can develop several months later.

Low mood, believing you are unable to cope and difficulty sleeping are all common symptoms of the depression.

Mood changes, irritability and tearfulness are all common after birth but normally fade shortly after birth.

If the symptoms persist, it could indicate postnatal depression.

As long as postnatal depression is recognised and treated, it is a temporary condition you can recover from, the NHS assures patients.

It is very important to seek treatment as it is unlikely to 'cure' itself.

Treatment for postnatal depression includes self-help advice, cognitive behavioural therapy and antidepressant medicine.

PND is thought to be the result of several things including physical and emotional stress of looking after a newborn baby, hormonal changes and social problems inclduing anxiety over money.

Women deemed more at risk of PND are those who have a previous history of depression.
