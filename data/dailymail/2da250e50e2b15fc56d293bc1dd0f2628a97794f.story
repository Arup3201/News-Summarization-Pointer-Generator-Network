She survived Graham Norton’s notorious red chair after sharing her hilarious story about going home with an Irishman who got up in the middle of the night to urinate in her shoes.

But what Brittany North, from Invercargill in New Zealand, forgot to mention on The Graham Norton Show was the happy ending to her sleepover horror - she’s still dating the man three years later.

‘I absolutely regret not telling the show that we’re still together,’ Ms North told Daily Mail Australia.

‘It dawn on me when I was going home and I’m gutted – it’s definitely the first thing I’d like to clear up. I was building up the story so I could make that point but then I got all flustered.’

Appearing on The Graham Norton Show, Brittany North shared a story about the night she met her boyfriend

But her story was enough to keep the British comedian and celebrity guests Sir David Attenborough, Jessica Chastain, Gary Lineker, Harry Hill and McBusted  from pulling the chair flipping-lever.

Mr Norton was already left in stitches when the 27-year-old, who is currently working as a nanny in London, opened up her story about having a few drinks with a friend at a bar called The Kiln in Invercargill.

‘I was out one night for a friend’s birthday when we ran into a couple of very cute Irish brothers,’ Ms North told the show.

‘So a few drinks later, one thing lead to another, and I actually went home with one of the brothers – the younger brother.

‘But I was rudely awoken in the middle of the night and he was standing in the corner peeing.

‘So I sort of woke up and went: “what are you doing, what are you doing?” He got a fright and sort of think [sic] he was half asleep – went to the toilet. All was well.

'Woke up in the morning and went OK this is where it gets awkward. Do I tell him – what do I do? Thought I'm never gonna see this guy again. So I went “do you remember peeing in the corner last night?” And he went “no, no I didn't” and was all embarrassed.

‘So went over and checked the corner and there was nothing there. It was dry. Went “oh I've dreamt it, what actually happened?”

‘Anyway he was dropping me off home, thought I'd get dressed. Went to put on my shoes and realised he'd peed in my shoes. I didn't actually tell him. I carried on home and threw the shoes out when I got home.’

The 27-year-old said she was flustered and forgot to tell Graham Norton that the man is still her boyfriend

Her boyfriend Danny gave Ms North the thumbs up to share his hilarious antic on the UK national show

Mr Norton was seen covering his mouth in disgust as he says: ‘I’m saying she should walk. That’s a good one’ as he asks his guests what Ms North should do before saying: ‘Brittany, you can walk!’

‘I was very excited because not many people get to walk away from the chair,’ Ms North told Daily Mail Australia.

‘One of the biggest highlights was speaking in front of David Attenborough – he’s one of my heroes.

‘It’s a great story to tell about the night we met and it’s all for a laugh. I pre-warned everyone, including my family and friends that the story will appear on TV and everyone loved it.

‘My family in New Zealand are getting together for a reunion on Friday – they’ve been looking at all the stories and interviews online so they’re very excited.’

Her boyfriend Danny Dowling, who is currently living in Ireland, gave Ms North the thumbs up to go ahead and share his hilarious antics on the night of their first encounter.

‘He sees the funny side of it and we didn’t realise it was going to get this big,’ Ms North said.

'I didn't tell Danny about the incident until six months into our relationship.

‘Danny’s family owns a pub in Ireland and on Friday night, they had a band playing but when my story was screened, they got the band to stop so they could watch my two minutes of fame on all three TVs at the pub.’

Despite her boyfriend's hilarious antic taking off on a light note, Ms North added that some were disappointed with Mr Norton’s comment when he suggested that she was ‘not paying any tax’.

‘I couldn’t hear what he was saying at the time because I was focussing on talking to the celebrities but I did wonder what they were laughing at,’ Ms North told Daily Mail Australia.

‘It wasn’t until I watched the segment with my boss that I'd realised what he'd said. She loved my story and she was disappointed by his comment.

‘I definitely pay my taxes.’

The red chair segment sees an audience member sit in the iconic chair and tell a humorous anecdote - only to be flipped backwards if they fail to tell a compelling story on the show.
