She has become the inspiration for women everywhere wanting to lose weight after shrinking from a size 20 to a svelte size eight in just one year.

And now Big Brother winner and Bristol resident Josie Gibson is flaunting the body she has worked so hard to achieve.

Following the launch of her first fitness DVD (and several steamy lingerie shoots), the bubbly blonde has turned her hand to designing, releasing her debut collection of clothes for online fashion retailer Goddiva....and modelling it all herself.

But the super slimmer has revealed that, although she is relishing her slim new body, she is absolutely terrified about putting the weight back on.

Showing off her hard work: Josie Gibson, who shot to fame on Big Brother, is showcasing her svelte new figure in her debut clothing line for Goddiva

Before and after: Josie shed an amazing amount of weight after seeing photographs of herself in a bikini and says she is terrified of going back there

She said: 'It's a lot of pressure, imagine if I put weight on. I'm terrified of going back there. I've got to do it because I'm not just doing it for me anymore, I'm doing it for everyone.

'I was so worried about putting the weight back on I didn't buy any new clothes but I've put all my old clothes on eBay now,' she admitted.

In May 2012 Josie was horrified when 
she saw unflattering photographs of herself in a bikini on the beach, 
which led her to lose the excess pounds.

Not
 only did the TV personality lose a staggering amount of weight, she did
 it in record time, dropping three stone in three months - and a total 
of six stone in just one year.

A healthy new diet helped her slim down from 16st 7lb and a size 18 to 10st 2lb and a svelte size eight.

'I did put my heart and soul into it. 
It's always going to be my life now because I'm one of those people who 
always has to watch what they eat and make sure I train it off; I'm not built petite, I'm built bigger,' she said.

Speaking about her healthy new diet, 
she explained: 'I eat all the time but little snacks. Sometimes I eat 
eight times a day but the right stuff.

'I love eating healthy, I love popping 
down to the farm shop and buying all the good stuff. But I've eaten 
cakes today so I feel bad now.'

Bubbly: Josie was chosen to turn her hand to designing because of her fun-loving personality, which they wanted to echo through her clothes

Josie explained that exercise forms a 
vital part of her new health plan and she trains four or five times a 
week, with high intensity training serving as the most effective method 
of weight loss for her.

One type of exercise she would love 
to try out is Yoga. She said: 'I can be quite highly strung sometimes 
so I think yoga would be good, 
maybe Bikram Yoga, which apparently makes you better in bed.

'I think 
my exercise has made me better in bed!'

Ever since debuting her new body, Josie has been hot property and been snapped up to pose for a number of magazines and lingerie shoots.

'It's such a fickle world that we live in, the offers have been rolling in since I lost weight,' she said.

Health kick: After seeing photos of herself on the beach Josie adopted a super healthy new lifestyle and now loves eating all the right kinds of food

While she is relishing all the opportunities that come her way, the Bristolian is adamant that she won't get 
caught up in the fickle world of fame and fortune.

'It's like I'm not living in a 
reality, I keep thinking I'm going to wake up. I've been like that since
 I came out of Big Brother.

'I can't believe that all this is 
happening to me, I am just a normal girl who goes home and cleans up poo on a farm, I 
prefer the normal life.

'I don't really have any celebrity friends, I like normal people. I love Cheska Hull from Made in Chelsea, I love all those Chelsea lot.

'I thought Pete Burns was going to be vile but he's actually the loveliest bloke and John McCririck is a really nice guy.'

Girly glam: Prices range from £42-£55 and her dresses are ideal for a girl's night out

She is also a big fan of Davina McCall, who she became close with during her stint on Big Brother.

She has since knocked Davina off the top of the exercise video charts with her debut fitness DVD, 30 Second Slim, but she is assured that the presenter would be proud of her.

'It's a lot of pressure, imagine if I 
put weight on. I'm terrified of going back there. I've got to do it 
because I'm not just doing it for me anymore, I'm doing it for everyone'

'I felt guilty at first. I do think she would be proud of me, I hope so anyway,' she said.

And to celebrate her hot new body, Josie has joined forces with online fashion retailer Goddiva to create the Josie Gibson for Goddiva collection, a range of glamorous evening-wear.

The 28-year-old was approached by 
Goddiva due to her entertaining, flirty personality, which they were 
keen to integrate into a new collection.

The team formed in mid-2012, before Josie's remarkable weight loss, when the label was keen to create a collection for 
women of all shapes and sizes.

Josie

 follows in the footsteps of Made In Chelsea star Louise Thompson, whose
 
two collections for the online retailer were a sell-out success, and the
 ex-BB housemate hopes her own range will be a similar hit.

Big loser: Josie went from 16st 7lb and a size 18 to 10st 2lb and a svelte size 8, and what better way to show it off?

The Josie Gibson for Goddiva 
collection combines Josie's love of fun prints, bodycon dresses and 
flattering maxis, making it an accessible collection for women of all 
ages and sizes.

From a fitted monochrome dress with 
bling embellishments, to a vibrant green number with a revealing cut out
 panel, Josie's collection of dresses are perfect for any glamorous 
night out.

Prices range 
from £42 to £55, and her dresses also include a trendy animal print 
dress reminiscent of Moschino's spring/summer 13 catwalk look.

The collaboration will see Josie 
interacting with fans and Goddiva customers with online competitions and
 giveaways, as well as providing weekly style advice, creating online 
links between her own website and Goddiva's.

And while she is currently occupied with promoting her new collection and sticking to her healthy lifestyle, the star has big plans for the future.

'First I want to help other people lose 
weight and then do a second collection with Goddiva. Now that I've lost weight I want to design some midriff baring dresses,' she said.

Josie Gibson for Goddiva is available now at Goddiva.co.uk
