A man wearing just his underpants and high on drugs managed to board an empty German government jet used by Chancellor Angela Merkel. 

Clutching a bag full of marijuana and ecstasy pills, the 24-year-old danced on the wing of the plane, sprayed foam around and pushed buttons in the cockpit of the jet in Cologne Airport.

The bodybuilder, believed to be of Turkish descent and named only as Volkan T, even released the inflatable emergency slide of the Airbus 319 on July 25.

It took four hours for officials to remove the intruder from the plane.

According to reports, the plane's emergency exits were accessible and the cockpit door was open.

It was also carrying up to eight tons of fuel.

Cologne state prosecutor Ulrich Bremer ruled out terrorism as a motive.

Angela Merkel was only hundreds of kilometers away at the opening of the Wagner opera festival

He told Spiegel Online: 'The investigation is focused on the charges of dangerous interference in aviation but also trespassing and damage to property. 

'As part of that probe it's of interest how the accused got onto the site and into the plane.'

It is believed the intruder may have had an argument with his girlfriend before driving from his home in Cologne to the airport.

He then blagged his way past security claiming he was going to a wedding reception in the officers' quarters before climbing a barbed wire fence and climbing onto the plane's left wing.

While playing with the buttons in the cockpit, he triggered an alarm.

Merkel was only hundreds of kilometers away at the opening of the Wagner opera festival in Bayreuth.

At least 100,000 euros of damage was caused to the plane which needed a new carpet, new coat of paint on its wing and a new emergency slide.

The jet is also used by other top state officials including President Joachim Gauck.

It has a private office, a conference room for 12 people and a main cabin with room for 32.
