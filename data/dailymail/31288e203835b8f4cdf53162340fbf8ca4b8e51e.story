They are the proud host nation of the 20th World Cup tournament and the odds-on favourites to lift the trophy in a month's time.

And before their opening game with Croatia, the doors were opened to the Brazil dressing room at the Arena de Sao Paulo to reveal their tools of the trade.

There were dozens of shiny new boots laid out in neat rows down the middle - some garish orange and yellow, others plain old black and white - waiting for their owners to claim them and lace up.

True colours: Brazil strips laid out neatly in the home dressing room at the Arena de Sao Paulo ahead of the opening World Cup match with Croatia

Boot room: The squad's boots are laid out in neat rows in the centre of the changing room, ready to be picked up by the players

Protection: Some of the personalised shinpads worn by the Brazilian team are lined up in the dressing room

Souvenir: The pennant Brazil captain Thiago silva will exchange with his Croatian counterpart ahead of kick-off

Famous yellow: Neymar's shirt pegged in the changing room

The shinpads, too, were arranged in immaculate lines, many customised in the image of their wearer.

Dante has the Brazilian flag printed on his, Fernandinho adds the Manchester City crest, while Maicon's are plain yellow with his name scribbled on in black marker pen.

On each peg along the side, that immortal yellow, blue and white strip folded beautifully for each of the 23 men who will attempt to deliver the nation's sixth World Cup.

Personalised: The boots to be worn by Victor during the opening match with Croatia

Golden boy: Similar personalisation on the boots of Chelsea star Oscar

Bright: Neymar's boots, complete with his name and national flag printed on the side

True blue: The boots worn by Hulk during the tournament

And next to that of Thiago Silva, the captain, the ornate pennant to be exchanged with his Croatian counterpart Darijo Srna, ahead of the kick-off.

Made of blue silk with a yellow surround, it bears the Brazilian crest and full details of the fixture.
