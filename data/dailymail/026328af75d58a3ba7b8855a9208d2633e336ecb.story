The 11-year-old boy walked free from court yesterday after pleading guilty to eight crimes - his mother blames his school for the boy's anger issues

The mother of a one boy crime wave blamed for a fifth of all crime in his home town has claimed his bad behaviour is the fault of his school - as they have not offered him anger management classes.

The 11-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, yesterday walked free from court after telling magistrates he wants to be a bank manager.

His mother, speaking after the hearing at youth court, said: 'He gets bored and frustrated which can make him more upset, destructive and angry.

'For me as a mother this stress is awful -  there's no anger management, no counselling.

'There's limited school support - that's why it's taken so long, lack of funding.'

The child, who was accused of exposing himself in a Carphone Warehouse and abusing customers with foul language in Costa Coffee, appeared before Yeovil Magistrates in Somerset on Friday.

He was previously given a conditional caution for two counts of violence against a person, arson, two counts of criminal damage, theft and handing stolen goods. 

After being told to pay attention and take his hands out of his pockets, the schoolboy told magistrates he wanted to work in a bank as he was good at maths.

Having arrived with his grandfather, the court was adjourned for two hours while police officers looked for his mother.

Upon his return he entered the court grinning to hear accusations of exposing himself to a girl in public and using profane language towards mothers and children in a coffee shop in Shepton Mallet. 

Police said the boy caused a spike in the number of crimes reported in the sleepy rural village - with 10 out of 50 crimes being attributed to him.

Describing the latest offences, Judith Morris, prosecuting, said: 'The offences took place on November 11 last year at around 3.30 pm at the Townsend retail park in Shepton Mallet.

'[He] was there, he walked into Costa Coffee and shouted various swear words when inside.

'In the store was mostly mums with children or elderly people. They were alarmed and distressed.

'After running out, a few minutes later he was outside a Carphone Warehouse. An 11-year-old girl was there.

'He called to get her attention and then he pulled down his trousers and pants exposing his genitals. She went home and told her mother.' 

But the court heard how the child had 'impressed' his solicitor as a 'nice, well behaved boy'. 

His grandfather told the court the boy was very clever, but had recently got in with the wrong crowd.

Ray Peters, defending, said: 'I have to say, over the short period of time I have spent with him, he has impressed me as being a nice, well behaved and intelligent boy.

'His mother has tried to get him on the straight and narrow. She tells me he has several issues, particularly with anger.

'Recently, he made contact with his biological dad who he has never had contact with.

'He left when his mum was three months pregnant. He said that he wanted no contact with the boy.

'He was taken out of mainstream education for a time and was well behaved. He then attended a placement.

'That placement came to an end because of the powers that be and he had to return to mainstream education.

'So far as these offences are concerned, I think they can best be described as showing off in front of older boys who he is clearly better off staying away from.'

After pleading guilty, the 11-year-old was told he could put his crimes 'behind him'.

Sentencing, Chair David Phillips said: 'I'm sure now it has all taken place you can appreciate how frightened people were. You realise that is wrong.

'We have heard consistently you are an intelligent boy. In terms of age, you are. You will now be given and opportunity to put this behind you.' 

Speaking outside the court yesterday his mother added that her son had not had sufficient support since he left a specialist school where his behaviour was 'impeccable'.

He returned to a conventional school, where he was expelled, a and is now waiting to be re-enrolled at his original school.

She said: 'A lot of people have been supporting me and saying they have been let down by authorities.

'The problem was they moved him from the school too early to go back into mainstream school, because academically he's clever.

'We're waiting for the [boarding] school to do a risk assessment which is just holding things up.' 

Magistrates handed the boy a three month referral order.
