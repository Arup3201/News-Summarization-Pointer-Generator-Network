If it’s not broken, don’t fix it - then again if you have £60million to spend, why not?

On Tuesday, Real Madrid added James Rodriguez to an abundance of attacking talent that includes Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema.

Last season they won the Champions League, breaking the record for goals scored, now manager Carlo Ancelotti has the enviable task of finding room for the winner of the Golden Boot at the World Cup.

The Colombian scored six goals in five games in Brazil, declared an immediate preference for Real Madrid over Barcelona and having just turned 23, he has his best years ahead of him. As galacticos go, he ticks all the boxes.

Thousands of supporters packed into the Bernabeu on Tuesday evening to welcome the former Monaco midfielder, who has signed for six years and will earn about £110,000-a-week.

For Madrid, signing the Jorge Mendes-managed player and dealing with Monaco owner Dmitry Rybolovlev has been far easier than Tottenham’s chairman Daniel Levy, who made them sweat until the end of last August for the services of Bale.

Real president Florentino Perez addressed supporters in the Bernabeu and had his name chanted as if he were another of the club’s cast of superstars.

The rest of football was left asking how Real manage the annual outlay and how Ancelotti will now manage to keep all his players happy.

The answer to both questions will, in part, be in the sale of players.

Just as last year the transfer of Gonzalo Higuain to Napoli and Mesut Ozil to Arsenal helped finance the capture of Bale, so this year Sami Khedira, Angel Di Maria and, if the right offer arrives, Isco, will help pay for the new arrivals.

Incoming Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas will require the departure of Diego Lopez or Iker Casillas.

Money raised in the transfer market, along with Madrid’s shared stranglehold over La Liga television revenue with Barcelona, has long helped keep them on top of football’s rich list, although before the arrival of Ancelotti they were unable to convert that dominance into European trophies.

Now the Italian, who in Lisbon last season guided them to their first Champions League in 11 years, will have to accommodate Rodriguez, who operates best as the No 10 in a 4-2-3-1.

If Ancelotti opts for that system, the new boy will be flanked by Ronaldo and Bale behind Benzema in attack, and Xabi Alonso or Luka Modric will partner last week’s £24m signing Toni Kroos in midfield.

Ancelotti is the master pragmatist and could also play 4-4-2 with a diamond midfield that has Rodriguez at the top and Alonso at the base with Modric and Kroos either side and Bale and Ronaldo up-front at the expense of Benzema.

Neither system accommodates Di Maria, Khedira or Isco, who must now be wishing he had followed his former boss Manuel Pellegrini to Manchester City last summer instead of moving to Madrid.
