Gareth Bale marked his return to the Real Madrid starting line-up by scoring after just nine minutes in a convincing 5-1 win over Rayo Vallecano that gave Carlo Ancelotti’s team their 13th straight victory.

The Welshman, who also hit the crossbar in the second half, has seen Madrid win their last seven games as he recovered from a Gluteus injury and some supporters have made no secret of the desire to seem the team left unchanged but he came in for Isco on Saturday night at the Santiago Bernabeu and helped Real to yet another comfortable win.

Cristiano Ronaldo played Toni Kroos in behind the Rayo Vallecano defence and the German midfielder crossed from the left for Bale to swoop at the back post and convert the centre for the opener.

Host commentator

A clinical display by Real Madrid restores them to the top of La Liga with 27 points from 11 points - two clear of their eternal rivals Barcelona. Ancelotti's side have now won 13 games in a row, scoring 52 goals and it is the fifth time they've netted five or more strikes in their last eight league matches. Meanwhile Ronaldo has 18 goals in 10 league appearances this season.That's all from me for tonight, but Sportsmail will be back soon with more top level football action.

The referee blows full-time on proceedings and Real record their ninth successive win in La Liga in convincing manner.

91 mins: Quini is booked for a mistimed challenge on Ramos.

90 mins: Medran nearly makes it six but sees his shot saved by Alvarez.

85 mins: And with that goal Carlo Ancelotti makes his final changes of the match as Benzema and Bale are replaced by Alvaro Medran and Javier Hernandez.

After making a brilliant save, Alvarez will want to forget this goal. Real pour forward with Ronaldo being found inside Rayo's penalty area from Isco's pass. The Portugal star cuts inside on his right foot before hitting a tame shot that goes through the grasp of Alvarez and into the net for his 23rd goal of the season in all competitions.

79 mins: Fantastic save by Alvarez once more. A long punt up field is headed away by the Rayo defence but only into the path of Bale. The Welsh wizard takes one touch before unleashing a swerving 25-yard left-footed strike that Alvarez does well to tip onto the crossbar.

Navas is trying too hard perhaps, knowing this is a rare chance to impress as he comes for a cross that he was never going to get on the end of. Real get away with it though and are still in total control.

74 mins: Navas has been shaky at times in goal for Real tonight and he nearly lets Rayo score once. The ball is whipped into the box and the goalkeeper comes rushing out to punch, but is beaten to the ball by Abdoulaye Ba who's header just goes past the post. A let off for the hosts.

73 mins: Rayo make their third and final change. Baptistao comes off for Manucho in a like-for-like swap.

70 mins: Well what can you say about Real? They've had less possession (45-55) than their opponents but are devastating when in attack. Ronaldo nearly makes it 5-1 bar a great save from Alvarez. With 20 minutes remaining more goals certainly look to be on the cards.

68 mins: Rodriguez comes off for Isco. One playmaker for another to add to Rayo's woes.

61 mins: Rayo make their second change of the night with Roberto Trashorras replaced by Jozabed.

The game looks done and dusted now. Pepe marches forward with the ball and finds Ronaldo on the right hand side of the Rayo penalty area. The 29-year-old drills the ball across goal and Benzema bundles it home. Replays show that the France international was offside though.

Tito is booked for a nasty challenge on Bale in the build-up to the goal.

What a beautiful strike by Kroos. Ronaldo weaves his way into the Rayo box before toe poking the ball back on the edge of the area to Kroos. The German international caresses the ball into the bottom corner of the net from 20 yards for a sumptuous goal.

 

Just 10 seconds earlier it could have been 2-2. Baptistao finishes neatly past Navas but is marginally offside. The outlook of this match could have been so different...

54 mins: The one criticism of Luka Modric is that he doesn't score enough goals and that is evident once more as Real attack. Bale's intended pass for Nacho finds Modric inside the Rayo box but he curls his right-footed effort past the post.

52 mins: Over five minutes into the second half and both sides have failed to trouble each other so far...

We're back underway at the Santiago Bernabeu...

Real came close to scoring a third before half-time when Gareth Bale's free kick just clears Alvarez's crossbar. As it is though it's 2-1 at the break. Ancelotti will be furious with the way his side conceded their goal - a strike that will give Rayo some belief after the interval.

Or is it? Terrible defending by Real Madrid to let Rayo back in the match. Navas throws the ball out to Rodriguez. Turning into danger the Colombia international inexplicably tries to play a pass back to the goalkeeper but it intercepted by Rayo. Bueno rounds Navas before tapping into an empty net.

And now it is. Bale sees his cross cleared behind for a corner. Rodriguez's set piece is whipped into the box and Sergio Ramos meets it with glancing volley that appears to come off his shin and loop into the net. That's his 50th goal of the club and a long way back for Rayo.

38 mins: Great save by Alvarez! Rodriguez collects the ball from 30 yards out and runs at the Rayo defence before unleashing a blistering left-footed drive that is brilliantly stopped by Alvarez for a corner. From the resulting set piece Benzema hits the top of the crossbar with a header. So nearly 2-0 for Ancelotti's side.

35 mins: Bit of magic from Bale. Having already scored, he collects the ball on the halfway line and turns his marker before running at the Rayo defence. Unfortunately for the hosts though he over hits his pass intended for Ronaldo.

33 mins: The game has started to settle down after a fast start following Bale's goal. Rayo have come into the match more as the game has grown but Real look dangerous every time they attack.

26 mins: Rayo boss Paco is already forced to make a substitute at 1-0 down as left-back Insua pulls a muscle and is replaced by Quini.

23 mins: As Rayo show some fight, Real hit them on the break with Ronaldo bursting clear. The Portugal star is stopped in his tracks unceremoniously by Rayo midfielder Mohammed Fatau and no foul is given - to the annoyance of the home supporters. On second evidence it should have been a free-kick and a yellow card to Fatau as Emiliano Insua was there to cover.

21 mins: Rayo are starting to show some fight. Leo Baptistao and Bueno both test Navas.

18 mins: It's wave after wave of Real pressure at the moment. It's early days but Carlo Ancelotti's side are playing brilliantly. Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez link up neatly before finding Ronaldo inside the box. However, the 29-year-old blazes over a great opportunity over the bar with his left foot.

It didn't take long did it. Ronaldo slips in a pass to Toni Kroos who whips in a low cross for Bale to tap into an empty net from close range. Things are already looking ominous for the visitors.

Rayo fans making plenty of noise; they have not had far to travel... Rayo a club club from the Vallecas neighbourhood of Madrid. 

6 mins: Real's confidence is oozing following their amazing run of 12 successive wins and it's showing following the opening stages of the match. Navas hasn't had to make a save yet as Real are starting to build some momentum.

2 mins: We have our first shot of the match and who else has it? Yes that man Ronaldo cuts in from the left and hits a dipping right-footed effort that is saved by Cristian Dario Alvarez.

The hosts get the game underway...

All the facts point in favour of a Real Madrid win. They've scored 37 goals in La Liga so far, sit top of the division and have won their last 12 games in all competitions. Can Rayo stop the Spanish giants juggernaut?

What can more you say about Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portugal superstar has scored 22 goals in all competitions and will be hungry to add to his tally against a Vallecano side who conceded 28 goals in their last nine visits to the Bernabeu.

Half a chance for Rayo tonight as Real Madrid play with their second keeper. Shame it's Keylor Navas who made more saves than anyone else in La Liga last season.

As boss Carlo Ancelotti guaranteed in the build-up to the match, Gareth Bale starts for the Spanish giants. The Wales international had missed the club's previous five games due to a muscle injury, before coming on as a substitute in their 1-0 win against Liverpool in the Champions League on Tuesday.Real Madrid XI: Navas, Nacho, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo, Kroos, Modric, Bale, Rodriguez, Ronaldo, Benzema.
