Investigators are coming closer to capturing a prolific child porn distributor who has evaded authorities for more than a decade - and still can only be identified through this one, blacked-out photograph.

'John Doe' is being hunted by  the Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Crimes Center using the latest technology which hones in on tiny clues.

An arrest warrant has been issued for John Doe in California, following the arrest of an alleged co-conspirator, but investigators say he could be anywhere in the world.

Hunted: John Doe, who has only ever been seen in this picture, is one of the most prolific child porn dealers in the world, according to investigators in Fairfax, Virginia

Danielle Bennett, spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), told MailOnline on Thursday that the black circle masking the wanted pedophile's face had been placed on it by those making the video.

Although details on the pedophile remain sparse, ICE and fellow law enforcement agencies are hoping that the arrest of a co-conspirator in January will tighten the net around him.

Letha Mae Montemayor Tucker, 52, was arrested outside a San Fernando Valley apartment complex in California on January 4.

The 52-year-old, who is nicknamed 'Butterfly', was indicted last month on federal charges of producing child pornography and child sex trafficking.

If convicted, she faces life in federal prison. She is currently being held without bond.

Montemayor was suspected of making and appearing in child porn photographs a decade ago.

She
faces charges of producing child pornography and conspiracy, officials 
said. Each charge carries a minimum 15-year prison sentence.

In the incriminating photos, the woman believed to be Montemayor, appears to be molesting a young girl.

The victim is now working with investigators to help find John Doe, an ICE spokeswoman told MailOnline.

Abuser: Letha Montemayor Tucker, who uses the nickname 'Butterfly', has also been charged with child trafficking

Forensic
experts believe the shots were taken around 11 years ago in San 
Fernando Valley. A phone book and calendar are visible which 
gave clues to the time frame.

The
images were first discovered by ICE agents in Chicago in 2007. A man 
was also seen in the photos.

The
woman in the photos had several distinctive tattoos, including a 
butterfly on her hip and a curled-up cat on her right shoulder.

Montemayor is thought to have been working with John Doe but not married to him or in a romantic relationship.

Experts delve into the horrifying 
world of child pornography to track down the pedophiles. Even the 
smallest clue, such as a plug socket, can bring them closer to making 
arrests.Â 

The team, based in Fairfax, Virginia,
works with law enforcement agencies all over the world to track down 
the sexual predators.

Year on year, the number of arrests 
have piled up. In 2010, 912 pedophiles were arrested by Homeland 
Security but by 2012, that number had almost doubled to 1,655 predators.

John Doe, Montemayor's co-conspirator, is still being sought and his identity and whereabouts remain unknown.
