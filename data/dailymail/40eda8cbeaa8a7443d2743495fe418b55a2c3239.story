A woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half to three years in prison after admitting to stealing almost $500,000 from a charity established to help victims of the Boston Marathon bombing.

Audrea Gause from Troy, New York gave most of the $480,000 she received from the One Fund to a contractor to build a new home according to prosecutors.

Prosecutors had sought a sentence of up to five years, but the judge granted a defense request for the lower sentence after Gause, 27, pleaded guilty in Suffolk Superior Court, MassachusettsÂ  to larceny over $250, according to the Boston Herald.

'It is disturbing that this defendant would attempt to steal from the real victims of the marathon bombing through fraud and deceit,' Attorney General Martha Coakley said in a statement. 'This defendant will now serve time in state prison for her actions.'

Ms Coakley added that all of the money had been recovered and will be returned to the charity.

Gause was arrested last July when she used $377,500 for a down payment on a house in Clifton Park, not long after receiving the money from the charity, according to prosecutors.

She submitted a claim to the fund, including several pages of false medical records indicating she was treated at hospitals in Boston and in New York for a traumatic brain injury suffered in the the bombings.

The claim 
alleged Gause sustained a brain injury from the bombing and experienced 
long-term memory loss, impaired speech and loss of some motor function.

Police
 said she had written on Facebook about the money, while they were also 
tipped off she had not even been in Boston at the time of the bombings.

The fund was created after the bombing and has collected more than $64million for victims, many of whom lost limbs.

Two bombs placed near the finish line of the April 2013 marathon killed three people and injured more than 260 last April.

 bombings, died following a shootout with police several days later.
