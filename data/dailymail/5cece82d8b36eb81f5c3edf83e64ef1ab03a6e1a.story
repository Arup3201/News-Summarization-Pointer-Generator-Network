Cassidy Stay, the lone survivor of a Texas shooting that claimed her parents and four younger siblings, broke down today as she saw their six white coffins being carried from their funeral.

The 15-year-old, who heroically called 911 despite being grazed by a bullet to warn authorities that the gunman was on his way to kill her grandparents, was comforted by friends and family outside the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Houston.

Her family - mother Katie 
Stay, 34, father Stephen, 39, and siblings, Bryan,
 14, Emily, nine, Becca, seven, and Zach, four - were remembered at an emotional funeral service on Wednesday afternoon.

A program 
for the service showed the slogan 'Families can be together forever' 
along with a picture of the victims, who were shot dead in their Houston 
home by a former family member a week ago.

Inside the church, the caskets were arranged with a large photo of each victim set up behind each one. Organ music filled the air, NBC reported.

Family members spoke at the service to paint a touching picture of the close, religious family, whose mother always loved to celebrate, and whose father always put his family first.

Stephen Stay's brother Jeff added that Cassidy wanted everyone to know that her father loved the drums, while her brother Bryan was obsessed with his tablet and brother Zach adored sea life.

Katie's 
sister, Aubrey Westwood, added that Cassidy said her sister Emily loved 
Hello Kitty, and Rebecca's nickname was Becca Boo.

Bishop Scott McBride told the surviving teen that her family would always be with her, NBC added.

'You have a family of guardian angels looking over you,' he said.

Before the service, Cassidy had been seen waving to her supporters and smiling before heading confidently inside the church with her uncle at her side.

Friends had said they were wrestling with the loss of what one called an 'anchor family', whose home was the place where neighborhood kids gravitated.

'I
 don't know if you ever prepare yourself for something like this because
 you don't expect this,' Don Guthrie, 57, a family friend and fellow 
church member, said before the funeral.

'This is a shock. This is incomprehensible.'

'They
 were the people, despite the chaos of life, who were always looking for
 happiness and looking to do something better,' said Tom Mixon, 47, a 
scoutmaster to one of the Stay boys.

'Katie
 Stay was adamant about teaching her kids to do better every day and to 
treat people better every day. And because of that we all wanted to be 
better and wanted to be around them.

'It's hard to wrap my head around it, when somebody that's so ensconced in your life like that is suddenly gone.'

Ronald Haskell, 33, has been charged with capital murder in connection to the massacre.

Authorities
 have said he was searching for his ex-wife, Katie Stay's sister 
Melanie, when he came to the Stays' home last week.

Injuries: Cassidy lost a finger in the incident, and on Wednesday, her finger bandage could be seen

He tied up
 the family and put them face-down on the floor before shooting each in 
the back of the head, according to investigators. The family had refused
 to say where Haskell could find his ex-wife.

Investigators
said Cassidy Stay suffered a skull fracture from a bullet 
graze but survived by playing dead to call 911 and warn police that 
Haskell planned to shoot other relatives.

Haskell was eventually cornered in front of the home of Cassidy's grandparents and taken into custody.

Those
 who knew the Haskells have said that the couple had a rocky marriage, 
and that Melanie was desperate to get away from her husband who 
allegedly beat her in front of their children.Â 

Haskell's
 lawyers have said they will focus on his mental condition and whether 
he was legally responsible for the carnage. Prosecutors haven't yet 
decided whether to seek the death penalty.

Cassidy, whose head was grazed by a bullet, was discharged from Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital 
Friday in good condition after being treated for injuries to her finger.

With her grandfather Robert Lyon, she attended a 
celebration of life organized in Spring to remember the slain loved 
ones at the weekend.

After
 taking a deep breath, a smiling Cassidy mounted the stage to address 
more than 400 people who came out to pay tribute to her parents and 
siblings, Click2Houston reported.

'I'm feeling a lot better 
and I'm on a very straightforward path to a full recovery,' she said.

'I know that my mom, dad, Bryan, Emily, 
Becca, and Zach are in a much better place, and that I'll be able to see
 them again one day.'

Revenge plot: Investigators say Haskell, pictured here with his ex-wife and three of their four children, went to his sister-in-law's home to try and get her to reveal the whereabouts of Melanie Haskell

Before the
 event at Lemm Elementary School, Cassidy helped release 600 colorful 
balloons into the air - 100 for each slain member of her family.

Those
 who wish to help with the victims' final expenses and Cassidy's medical
 bills can do so by donating money to the Cassidy Stay Fund on GoFundMe.com.

So far, more than 4,300 people have given more than $340,000. The goal now is to raise $375,000.
