If you think you give your workout gear a run for its money with punishing sessions of Bikram and British Military Fitness, spare a thought for the likes of Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, the stars of Hunger Games: Catching Fire, the second in the trilogy, released later this month.

They're not just sweating in yoga studios and doing press-ups in the mud, they're throwing swords, shooting arrows and generally trying to stay alive in the most inhospitable environment ever.

When the film's costume designer, Trish Summerville was trying to find the right sort of clothes for the tributes to wear in the arena, she googled 'futuristic sportswear'.

What popped up was high-end sportswear brand, Lucas Hugh, the brainchild of Anjhe Mules, who had spent 15 years designing swimwear - for her own label, as well as with Speedo, Marc Jacobs and Alexander McQueen.

'Everything we do is about the future,' explains Anjhe, who developed the line after feeling that there was a gap in the market for designer-style sportswear that was attractive, functional and wearable outside of the gym.

But the hostile setting of the arena is quite different from the yoga studios of West London, how could Anjhe be sure that her designs would stand up to the rigours of the Hunger Games?

'Everything we design is created for extremes of movement, so that you can do anything and your top won't ride up, or twist.

'All our seams are glued so that they 
don't rub, and the fabrics have compression technology to support your 
muscles, and are antibacterial and designed to wick away moisture,' says
 Anjhe.

'All the pieces in my collection are 
tested by professional sportspeople - I know a lot of personal trainers 
so kit really gets put through its paces to make sure it really is fit 
for everything from running and weight-lifting to pilates.'

While many of the outfits - such as the Prince Albert jacket (£320) and the Dial capri pants (£165) which you'll see Katniss wearing while training for the Quarter Quell - translated directly from the main collection to the film set, one aspect that was slightly more challenging was menswear.

'I'd never designed menswear before and initially I thought I knew exactly what I wanted but at the first fitting it became clear that certain things just didn't work,' says Anjhe.

Extension of the collection: Jennifer Lawrence adorns a similar style 'Prince Albert' jacket which can be currently brought online at lucashugh.com

'There were - um - certain bits that needed to be concealed,' she laughs.

While all the womenswear looks that are showcased in the film are available to buy at LucasHugh.com, any men who fancy emulating Peeta will have to wait a while.

'Designing menswear for the film has inspired me to create a menswear line alongside the existing womenswear collection, but that won't launch until next Autumn,' reveals Anjhe.

And, it seems that Jennifer Lawrence was so taken with the Lucas Hugh kit, that when the cameras stopped rolling, she didn't want to take it off.

'I'm good friends with Jennifer's personal trainer and I have it on good authority that she still wears it and loves it,' beams Anjhe.
