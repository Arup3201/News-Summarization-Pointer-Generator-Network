The Bank of England risks being dragged into a criminal investigation into how it propped up ailing lenders during the financial crisis, it emerged last night.

The central bank supplied high street lenders with emergency funds in 2007 and 2008 through so-called money-market auctions to stop the banking system freezing up as the credit crunch intensified.

But it last year instructed a leading barrister to look into whether any of its staff knew of, or even participated, in attempts to rig the auctions.

The Bank has since passed on the results of the inquiry by Lord Grabiner QC to the Serious Fraud Office which is now examining the findings.

The SFO said it was ‘investigating material referred to it by the Bank of England concerning liquidity auctions during the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008’.

It is thought that the probe could lead to a full-blown criminal inquiry – although it is unclear whether such an investigation would focus on Bank officials or traders outside the central bank.

An official criminal investigation would be a blow to the reputation of the Bank following a series of scandals that have rocked the financial sector.

Senior Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, who chairs the Treasury committee in the Commons, said the bank was right to refer inquiry to Serious Fraud Office

In a statement last night, the Bank said: ‘Following the confirmation by the SFO that it is investigating material referred to it by the Bank of England, the Bank can now confirm that it commissioned Lord Grabiner QC to conduct an independent inquiry into liquidity auctions during the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008.

‘Following the conclusion of that initial inquiry, the Bank referred the matter to the SFO on 20 November 2014.

‘Given the SFO investigation is ongoing, it is not appropriate for the Bank to provide any additional comment on the matter at this time.’

Senior Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, who chairs the Treasury committee in the Commons, said the central bank was right to refer the findings to the SFO.

He added: ‘We must now await the outcome of the SFO’s work. The sooner their findings are published the better.’

The Bank launched the money-market auctions during the financial crisis in an attempt to ensure that high street banks could continue to lend to households, businesses and each other. The investigation into the auctions comes as the central bank faces increased scrutiny over its governance and oversight of the financial system.

A separate inquiry by Lord Grabiner into the rigging of the foreign exchange markets cleared Bank officials of any wrongdoing.

The Bank revealed on Tuesday it has uncovered 50 instances of market manipulation and that 42 of them have been handed to the Financial Conduct Authority.
