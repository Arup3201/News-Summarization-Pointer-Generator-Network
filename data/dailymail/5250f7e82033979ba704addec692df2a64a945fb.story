The pressure mounted on Chris Cairns yesterday after claims that the ex-wife of Lou Vincent had warned the New Zealand all-rounder about his involvement with match-fixing.

New Zealand TV channel One News revealed that Elly Riley last year told anti-corruption investigators that ‘Chris was going to pay (Lou) $50,000 a game for fixing’ at the Indian Cricket League in 2008.

Cairns was captain of the Chandigarh Lions in the privately run ICL, which was played between 2007 and 2009.

Vincent was one of the team’s five overseas players.

Riley claims she confronted Cairns in Manchester in 2008.

I told you! Chris Cairns was warned about match-fixing, according to Lou Vincent's ex-wife Elly Riley

‘I said that you’re involving so many 
players — you’re involving the whole team and by doing that you’re 
getting greedy,’ she said. ‘I just can’t see how information on the 
fixing is not going to leak out to others and you’re not going to get 
caught.

‘Chris said that I was right, but told me not to worry as he had it all under control. Chris just sort of laughed it off.’

Cairns
 continues to deny involvement in corrupt practices, yesterday posting a
 tweet in which he said he was ‘not rejecting I am Player X … it’s the 
allegations I reject’.

He 
also tweeted: ‘Thanks for all the support out there and to all those who
 understand that there are bigger forces at play here...chat 
soon...cheers.’

Those 
allegations, first reported by Sportsmail, include claims by Vincent 
that he was acting on behalf of Cairns while fixing matches, and by New 
Zealand captain Brendon McCullum that he was twice approached by Cairns 
in 2008 to fix games — approaches McCullum claims he turned down.

McCullum
 is said to be furious that his testimony to the ICC’s anti-corruption 
unit was leaked, and that Cairns subsequently accused him of lying.

Place in the sun: Lou Vincent is alleged to have tried to invest money from spot-fixing in Dubai property

Meanwhile, it has emerged that Vincent attempted to invest the money he made from fixing in property in Dubai.

A
 claimed contact of Cairns is alleged by Vincent to have helped set up 
the purchase in the Jumeirah Beach Residence, but Vincent had to ‘pull 
out’ because money he was allegedly expecting from Cairns did not 
materialise.

Vincent, said 
to be in hiding in New Zealand for fear of reprisals, believed Cairns 
was ‘working with someone else in arranging fixing in the ICL’.
