David Cameron was yesterday forced to deny Britain will place Army ‘boots on the ground’ in Mali.

Ministers were ordered to the Commons to stress that UK troops would not ‘undertake a combat role’ in the crisis in West Africa, amid fears they could be sucked into a long, bloody conflict

The Prime Minister has offered logistical air assistance to France, whose troops have joined government forces in fighting Islamic fanatics in its former colony.

Mr Cameron fears the country’s 
insurgent-held northern desert could become a haven for terrorists to 
plan and launch international strikes.

Two RAF C-17 Globemaster  aircraft 
have been deployed to  transport French military vehicles, kit and 
supplies to their war-torn former colony.

The giant planes will fly to the capital Bamako and the deployment is scheduled for seven days.

But Defence Minister Andrew Robathan 
alarmed critics by admitting that this ‘could increase’ - prompting 
accusations that they are risking ‘mission creep’ with any escalation of
 UK involvement in the military operations against the rebels.

Britain has offered transport plans to help the French government, which last night bombed targets near the northern Malian city of Gao

Ministers confirmed that a detachment of around 10 British military personnel were in Bamako to meet the aircraft.

And it is understand that UK Special Forces have also deployed to the conflict zone.

In the Commons, Shadow Foreign 
Minister John Spellar said: ‘Is this viewed as a one-off British 
contribution, or does this mark the beginning of a phased engagement 
which could see further British capabilities play a part in future?’

Support: English soldiers listen to a colleague as they load French material in an aircraft. David Cameron has decided to send troops to support an offensive by Mali government forces against Islamist rebels

Africa Minister Mark Simmonds (pictured left) said Britain is 'only providing limited logistical support'. The action comes as French intelligence agent Denis Allex (right) is feared dead

Labour’s Peter Hain, a former Cabinet 
minister, warned that Britain risked being dragged into a ‘long drawn 
out and difficult morass’. Mr Cameron told Radio 4’s Today programme: 
‘There is a very dangerous Islamist regime allied to Al Qaeda in control
 of the north of that country.

‘So we were first out of the blocks, 
as it were, to say to the French “we’ll help you, we’ll work with you 
and we’ll share what intelligence we have with you and try to help you 
with what you are doing”.’

France launched its air offensive after al-Qaeda rebels made advances in the key Mali city of Konna

He agreed to free up the RAF transporters after speaking to French president Francois Hollande on Saturday.

In a statement to Parliament, Africa 
Minister Mark Simmonds said: ‘We must not allow northern Mali to become a
 springboard for extremism.’

Britain is also considering sending 
Army officers to train Malian soldiers to fight against the Islamists 
and coordinate training, logistical and intelligence support for a 
3,000-strong African peacekeeping force.

Military action: French Mirage 2000 D aircraft fly over Mali, after taking off from the French military base of N'Djamena, in Chad

Forced to act: A fighter jet refuels above the skies of Mali. French President Francois Hollande has said he had to take action against the terrorists who 'show a brutality that threatens us all'

Mr Cameron was speaking on the fourth day of France’s intensive bombardment against militant positions.

France deployed around 550 soldiers to
 Mali and began a wave of ferocious air strikes to thwart an advance by 
Islamist rebels on Friday following a request from the country’s 
president.
