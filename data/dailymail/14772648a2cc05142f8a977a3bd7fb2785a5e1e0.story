X-Men director Bryan Singer has been accused of committing a new sexual assault against a man in his 20s in New York City last year, according to the New York Police Department.

The criminal complaint was filed with the NYPD on May 9, 2014, alleging that Singer forced the man into a sexual act in New York against his will on March 23, 2013 according to Buzzfeed.

However, while no charges have been filed against the well-known Hollywood director, law enforcement officials said an investigation has been launched.

Allegations: Bryan Singer has been accused of committing a  sexual assault against a man in his 20s in New York City last year

It’s not the first time that the hit movie maker has faced allegations of sexual assault against boys.

Two civil lawsuits alleged that Singer had sexually assaulted teenage boys – but both have recently been dropped.

The first, filed in May, by an unnamed British man known as ‘John Doe 117’ claimed that Singer had drugged and sexually assaulted him in a London hotel when he was a teenager.

The man withdrew the case in July 2014.

The second case against Singer was filed in April by former aspiring actor Michael Egan, 31, in which he accused him of sexually abusing him during trips to Hawaii when he was 17.

Accuser: Michael Egan III, dropped his lawsuit against director Bryan Singer on Wednesday

But he dropped the case on Wednesday after reportedly being unable to find a lawyer who would represent him.

In 1997, a
 14-year-old extra accused Singer of asking him and other minors to film
 a shower scene in the nude for the film Apt Pupil.

A lawsuit was filed but dismissed for insufficient evidence.

According to Singer’s Twitter feed, he was in New York and Jersey on March 23, the date the most recent assault is alleged to have taken place.

He tweeted: 'Reviewing previs on way back to Montreal. Got out of NYC before the storm,' from what appears to be to be a private plane.

In another tweet he was pictured outside a Denville Dairy and wrote: 'In Jersey, visiting the folks.'

The complaint filed against Singer is described as a ‘criminal sexual act.’

Under New York law, a ‘criminal sexual act’ usually relates to an adult having sex with someone who is underage.

Singer’s lawyer, Martin Singer, told Buzzfeed: ‘Neither my client nor any of his representatives have been contacted by the NYPD, or anyone else about an alleged criminal investigation of my client.

‘My client did not engage in any criminal or inappropriate behavior with anyone in New York or elsewhere.’

He added: ‘False investigations are filed all the time and no action is taken by the authorities.’

Singer is a prolific filmmaker and has directed big budget Hollywood films which include Superman Returns and The Usual Suspects.

His most recent film, X-Men: Days of Future Past, was released in May and has grossed more than $744 million worldwide.
