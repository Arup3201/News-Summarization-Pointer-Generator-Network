The proportion of people living in northern England has slumped to its lowest level in 200 years, as millions flock to the south in search of work.

A new study today revealed just 27.9 per cent of people live in the North West, North East or Yorkshire and Humber. The last time as smaller share of the population lived there was in 1811.

It also shows the northern economy is underperforming, with less growth, lower productivity, more reliance on the public sector and shorter life expectancy.

Young people move to the north to study at university, but flock south in their twenties in search of graduate job opportunities

Chancellor George Osborne this week vowed to build a 'Northern Powerhouse' between the great cities of the north.

And tomorrow Deputy PM Nick Clegg will host a Northern Futures Summit in Leeds to asses how the area can 'compete with the biggest cities and regions in the world'.

But the data from the Office for National Statistics shows the scale of the challenge, with the north slipping behind the rest of England.

It means millions of especially young people leave each year to find a job and a better life.

The proportion of people living in north peaked in the early 1900s, at the height of the industrial revolution, but has been falling since.

The ONS said: 'Historically, the North’s share of the English population has been declining since the early 20th century. 

'During the industrialisation of the 19th century the North’s share of the population grew, meeting the labour requirements of the factories and mills in the North of England.'

Since 1997, average annual economic growth has been higher in the rest of England than in the north, even when London is excluded

The north is more reliant on the public sector than the rest of the country, and has suffered more with the impact of public spending cuts

There are fewer business per 10,000 people in the north, with the economy struggling to keep pace

Men and women both have lower life expectancy in the north than in the rest of the country

The north’s share of England’s population peaked around 1911 at 36.5 per cent. Since 1911, the population share has fallen and in 2013 was 27.9 per cent, a return to the share last seen in 1821.

Today 15.1million people live in the north, up 762,000 since 2001, but the population of the rest of country has grown more quickly.

Northern universities attract students from the rest of England but after graduating the gains are reversed when they head southwards in their twenties. 

In 2013, 11,623 more people aged 18-20 moved to the North from the rest of England than journeyed the other way, the ONS said.

In the 21-30 age group, 23,831 more moved southwards than northwards. 

This is in part the result of 'less favourable labour market conditions', in particular a lack of job opportunities for graduates in the North.

Unemployment has been higher in the north for the last two decades, and was harder hit by the downturn

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today announced £15million to boost tourism to the north of England

The employment rate in the north has been lower than the rest of the country for the last two decades, with the north’s labour market being 'hit relatively harder by the downturn'.

The ONS added: 'When compared with the rest of England, the latest data show that the North underperforms on several economic and social indicators. 

'Its shares of economic output, jobs and household income fall below its share of the population. It has lower labour productivity. 

'Life expectancy is shorter and average reported happiness is slightly lower than the rest of England.

'The North also experienced slower economic growth than the rest of England over the 1997 to 2012 period.'

However the economic powerhouse of London distorts the figures. Excluding the capital, the gap between growth rates in the North of England and the other English regions was smaller.

Today the government announced an extra £10million to draw up a tourism strategy for the north.

Mr Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, said: 'It’s absurd that our great north is missing out on visitors when it boasts such stunning countryside, history and culture. 

'Through the Northern Futures project, I asked people what our northern cities needed in order to compete globally, and to grow.'
