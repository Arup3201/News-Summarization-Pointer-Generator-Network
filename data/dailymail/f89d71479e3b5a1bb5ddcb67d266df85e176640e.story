Feel under pressure by your family and friends to do something you really don’t want to do? Researchers have found if you wait three days you will assert yourself again.

Researchers at Chinese universities asked 200 men to rate the attractiveness of 280 young adult Chinese women on an eight point scale. The students were brought back to the lab to rate the faces again after either a day, three days, seven days, or three months had passed.

The researchers found that their initial marks could go up or down in the first three days when they learned how their fellow students had voted but after that period they stuck with their initial assessment.

They were shown the same faces again after one day, three days, one week or three months and asked to rate again.

Psychological scientist and study author Rongjun Yu of South China Normal University said: ‘Our findings suggest that exposure to others’ opinions does indeed change our own private opinions — but it doesn’t change them forever.

‘Just like working memory can hold about seven items and a drug can be effective for certain amount of time, social influence seems to have a limited time window for effectiveness.’

The research is published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science.
