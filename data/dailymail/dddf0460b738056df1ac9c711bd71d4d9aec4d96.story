Sitting on long wooden benches in a dimly-lit hall, rows of men  - scruffy and unwashed - look grimly at the camera as they ready for another night in the shelter.

Every one of them has paid one penny - roughly 32p today - for a space on the bench or on the floor. Their night will be spent sitting up, or leaning against a cold, dank wall.

This shelter in Blackfriars, London, was set up by the Salvation Army in the early 1890s - one of a number of places that provided temporary housing to thousands who were poor or homeless.

The bleak scene is just one of the images included in an upcoming museum exhibition that seeks to explore the places inhabited by London's most deprived at the turn of the last century.

Home for the night: Each man in this photo paid one penny - roughly 32p today - for a space on the bench or on the floor of this London shelter

Benefits: While this scene of a workhouse mealtime might look bleak, reports suggest that some men were simply grateful for food

Through photographs, paintings and first-hand accounts, Homes of the Homeless: Seeking Shelter in Victorian London, which opens at The Geffrye in London, shows what it really meant to be poor.

While today the term can describe Britons who live comfortably, 110 years ago it covered the men, women and children who only had a few pennies to their name - if any. 

But despite their poverty, their experiences were not always the desperate tales immortalised in Dickensian novels, explained Hannah Fleming, a curator at The Geffrye.

Your fate depended on who you were, where you stayed - and how much you could scrape together. 

Beginning in the 1840s, the exhibition charts how, as the century wore on, the problems of accommodating London’s poor became more acute. 

Slum clearance and the demolition of housing to make way for the railways pushed the poor into ever decreasing areas. Rents soared and living conditions plummeted. 

The exhibition starts with the street, looking at where the homeless slept rough in the city. 

This, said Fleming, drew some interesting comparisons to the present-day, with many of the same 'hotspots' for homelessness remaining today.

It then looks at where the destitute, or those who were able to make only a precarious living might seek shelter. 

'Coffin beds': These cramped bunks weren't particularly comfortable, but they did offer visitors a dry and clean place to sleep

While popular accounts of the shelters and workhouses, often by middle-class observers, make them seem bleak and uninhabitable, they are often seen in a more favourable light by their lower-class visitors. 

One of the sketches in the collection, for example, illustrates a group of men settling in for a night in so-called 'coffin boxes' - wooden bunks that were barely long enough to fit a body. 

This scene shows life inside Medland Hall, in the former London borough of Ratcliff. 

The establishment opened in 1893 and, by the early 1900s, attracted hundreds of men hoping to secure a stay in one of the 450 bunks.

While the cramped and uncomfortable conditions might provoke shock in middle-class Victorians and modern-day viewers, the 'coffin beds' - clean, dry and sheltered from the elements - were a welcome sight for most homeless Victorians.

And a meal in one of these shelters - captured in another depressing image that shows men sat side-by-side at long tables - meant food and a roof over their heads.

A night at one of these shelters, which were often run by charitable or philanthropic organisations, would cost one penny. Visitors also had the option of completing a work task to earn their keep.  

But shelters weren't meant as long-term solutions, said Fleming, so those who ran them had to keep them from feeling too inviting. 

She said: 'They didn't want to be seen to be encouraging homelessness so they implemented things like mandatory washing with shared bathwater when you entered.'  

Those who had slightly more money - perhaps earned from intermittent work - could pay threepence for a room in a common lodging. 

These simply-furnished rooms, situated in houses owned by private landlords, would include not much more than a simple bedframe, but they did offer more privacy than a shelter or workhouse.

For sixpence, one could afford a bed in a model lodging house - with private rooms and slightly more luxury. 

The dirty and cramped conditions in these lodging houses excited both sympathy and disapproval from contemporary observers.

Later in the century more efforts were made to provide housing for the poor, for families and for single men living by themselves, as well as specialist accommodation for children.

Experiences also varied greatly on whether you were a man, woman or child, explained Fleming. 

Records of meals and sleeping arrangements reveal that slightly more care was given to the most vulnerable - 'invalids', women and children - while fit, working-aged men often had the worst deals.

While our way of measuring - and handling - poverty and homelessness might have changed since the Victorian era, the issue remains a contemporary one. 

That is why a parallel exhibition will run along side Homes for the Homeless, one that engages with contemporary homelessness in London. 

Homes of the Homeless: Seeking Shelter in Victorian London opens at the Geffrye, London 24 March - 12 July 

Now

The main measure used by the Government to define poverty in the UK today is whether or not the household income is below 60 per cent of the median income. This is calculated Before Housing Costs (BHC) such as council tax and rent are taken into consideration.

The UK's average salary, as of January 2014, is £26,500. The latest figures on poverty from 2012/2013, released by the Department for Work and Pensions in July this year, shows the average household income Before Housing Costs is £440 per week. 

Based on that figure, the report found 15 per cent (9.7m) of Britons are living in poverty.

There have also been other types of poverty introduced which are recognised by the Government. These include fuel poverty and material deprivation, the latter of which refers to the 'self-reported inability of individuals or households to afford particular goods and activities that are typical in society at a given point in time'.

The Government also recognises 'persistent poverty', seen as those living in households where income is less than 60 per cent of median household, for at least three out of the last four years.

In 2011, each person's disposable income in the UK was around £14,000.  

The 60 per cent measure is criticised because it is relative to the current economic state of the country - meaning there could effectively be 'less people' living in poverty during a recession.  

Then 

During the 1800s, a great proportion of Londoners lived in terrible poverty. Victorian cities were overcrowded, filthy and bleak. But it was often not known exactly how many were 'poor' - and how they should be classed. 

Charles Booth, a successful businessman, thought social reformers had exaggerated London's poverty levels, which were said to be about a quarter. In 1886, he decided to find out the truth. As part of his research Booth lived with working-class families for several weeks at a time. It revealed the level of want was even worse than generally thought: as many as one third of Londoners lived in poverty. 

He took into account a wide variety of subjects including working conditions, education, wage levels, workhouses, religion, and police.

Booth's work was instrumental in establishing the old age pension, an idea which had been around since Thomas Paine's Rights of Man in 1791. The first pensions were paid on 1 Jan 1909 (2 January in Scotland). 

The census also provided some information on the country's most deprived
