Gethin Jenkins has been promoted from substitute to captain as Warren Gatland names a new-look line-up for Saturday’s Test against Fiji.

The Kiwi coach was expected to make wholesale changes and, as reported by Sportsmail, experienced loosehead Jenkins returns to the starting XV after his impressive impact from the bench against Australia.

Jenkins is joined in the tight-five by second rows Bradley Davies and Luke Charteris, of Wasps and Racing Metro, as well as Ospreys hooker Scott Baldwin.

Sam Warburton (centre, applauding), Wales' regular captain, has been rested for the Fiji clash

Inside centre Jamie Roberts is one of just seven players who keep their place after the Australia defeat

Liam Williams (Scarlets), Alex Cuthbert (Cardiff Blues), Scott Williams (Scarlets), Jamie Roberts (Racing Metro), George North (Northampton Saints), Rhys Priestland (Scarlets), Mike Phillips (Racing Metro), Gethin Jenkins (Cardiff Blues, CAPT), Scott Baldwin (Ospreys), Samson Lee (Scarlets), Bradley Davies (Wasps), Luke Charteris (Racing Metro), Dan Lydiate (Unattached), Justin Tipuric (Ospreys), Taulupe Faletau (Newport Gwent Dragons).

Replacements: Emyr Phillips (Scarlets), Nicky Smith (Ospreys), Rhodri Jones (Scarlets), Alun Wyn Jones (Ospreys), James King (Ospreys), Rhodri Williams (Scarlets), James Hook (Gloucester), Cory Allen (Cardiff Blues).

‘We have made a number of changes, but we are going out there with what we think is a strong side to take on Fiji,’ said Gatland.

‘The whole squad has been working very hard and were pushing for selection last week so it’s an opportunity for them to start.

‘We were pleased with the performance last week and we will be looking to build on that and get the result we want this weekend.

‘We have made some changes, some have been enforced due to injury but we don’t feel it weakens the side.’

Samson Lee, Dan Lydiate and Taulupe Faletau are the only forwards to keep their place in the pack. Justin Tipuric, the British and Irish Lion, comes in to replace captain Sam Warburton, who is rested.

The return to fitness of centre Scott Williams allows George North to move back to the wing, partnering Alex Cuthbert and Liam Williams in the back-three.

Taulupe Faletau will continue at No 8, but only three of the Welsh pack will start both games 

Alex Cuthbert, who scored Wales' second try last weekend, retains his place on the wing for the Fiji clash

Defensive captain Jamie Roberts keeps his place at inside-centre, playing on the shoulder of a new half-back combination of Mike Phillips and Rhys Priestland. James Hook is named on the bench after being drafted into the squad on Sunday night.

Wales are hoping for their first win of the series after Saturday’s 33-28 defeat by Australia at the Millennium Stadium. Gatland’s side have won just one of their previous three Tests against Fiji, who are boosted by the return of Leicester wing Vereniki Goneva and Ospreys centre Josh Matavesi.

‘Josh Matavesi has rejoined the squad following injury and Vereniki Goneva has also joined the squad,’ said Fiji coach John McKee. ‘Goneva was unable to travel to France last week due to late issue of his visa.’
