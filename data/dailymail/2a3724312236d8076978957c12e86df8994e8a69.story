The White House has released its photographic look back at 2014, proving it has been quite a year for President Obama and those closest to him.

On the political front, there was his meeting with Ebola survivor Nina Pham as well as a terse moment between him and Russian president Vladmir Putin.

On the family front, a photo shows him and daughter Sasha sharing a quiet moment while another has him, Malia and Michelle as they enjoy a trip to the National Portrait Gallery.
