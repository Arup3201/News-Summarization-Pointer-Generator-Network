A Gay policeman is suing Scotland Yard claiming he was taunted for ‘having sex with Michael Barrymore’.

PC Dan Lichters said he was embarrassed when fellow officers asked if he had relationships with ‘any other celebrities’.

The constable said he became friends with the TV entertainer in 2001 following his arrest after a man’s body was found in his swimming pool.

Gay policeman Dan Lichters is suing Scotland Yard for discrimination, harassment and victimisation and claims he was taunted for ‘having sex with entertainer Michael Barrymore’

The 34-year-old, a serving policeman at Barkingside Police Station in East London who was commended for his bravery during the London riots, claims he was repeatedly victimised for his sexual orientation. PC Lichters is suing the Met over claims of discrimination, harassment and victimisation.

He told an employment tribunal he met Barrymore when he was out with friends and, following the entertainer’s arrest, he had offered him emotional support. He had informed his bosses about his friendship and claims rumours about him being involved in the death of Stuart Lubbock at Barrymore’s home were spread.

PC Lichters, who joined the Met in 1999, told the tribunal in London: ‘Because of my sexual orientation, for years I have been harassed and discriminated against by officers and management on many occasions.

‘In one incident, two PCs questioned me about Barrymore and asked me if I had sh***ed any other celebrities. I was very embarrassed and affected by the comment.’

In 2008, after he joined the dog unit, he said he suffered more abuse after his four-month-old police puppy Oscar was attacked during a walk by a pit bull. His version of how the dog received its injuries was questioned by senior officers. They began an investigation, which PC Lichters described as ‘disproportionate’.

He said fellow officers spread ‘salacious rumours’ that he had invented the dog attack. He told the tribunal: ‘There were rumours, including I had been gay cruising on Hampstead Heath with my dog and, due to me neglecting it while having gay sex, it had been injured.’

The officer claimed he was also told: ‘We don’t want queers in the dog section.’

Louise Chudleigh, representing the Metropolitan Police, said the investigation had been necessary as the ‘puppy incident’ called into question his honesty and integrity.

She told PC Lichters: ‘Anything that calls into question the integrity of a serving police officer should be looked into thoroughly.’

She put it to him that he had been treated the same as any other officer. The Met denies acting improperly, and the tribunal continues.
