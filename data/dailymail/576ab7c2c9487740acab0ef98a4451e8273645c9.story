A Florida man has been sentenced to 105 years for preying on girls aged between 13 and 18 in what may be the  largest sexual extortion case in the history of the United States, authorities say.

A Jacksonville federal judge gave the lengthy sentence to 31-year-old Lucas Chansle, who pleaded guilty to nine counts of producing pornography. 

Each count carries a sentence of 15 to 30 years as well as a $250,000 fine, New York Daily News reports. 

Over the course of three years, Chansler reached out to more than 300 minors in 26 states on Facebook and MySpace, concealing his identity behind more than 60 different screen names, Daily News reports.

Prosecutors say he approached the girls on social media pretending to be a friend or acquaintance, he would gain the girl's trust then persuade them to expose themselves on video chat. Unbeknownst to them, he recorded it. 

News4Jax reports that Chansler would ask the girls, usually between the ages of 13 and 18, to video chat and would stream a video of a teenage boy masturbating to entice them. 

Once the girls exposed themselves, he would blackmail them into showing more, saying if they did not comply he would show the recorded video chat to their friends and ruin their reputation. 

Of the 350 targeted, the FBI confirmed that 103 were positively identified minors. The FBI reports that a search of Chansler's computer showed 80,000 images and videos, many of which depicted child pornography. Of the 3,000 videos the FBI found, 200 of those contained child pornographic.

Targeted: Chansler targeted more than 300 girls in 26 states over the course of three years using 60 different social media accounts

He told the FBI that he targeted underage girls because adult women were 'too mart' for his schemes.

Chansler was arrested in 2010 after the FBI used information given by the parents of one of Chansler's victims and worked with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to locate Chansler's St. Johns County residence, the FBI reports.

The sexual extortion occurred from 2007 to 2010. 

In multiple videos uncovered by the FBI, many of the victims cried and begged Chansler not to make them continue. 

Chansler has been in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service since 2010, according to Daily News, but has not stood trial up until this year because his attorney questioned his competence, saying he suffered severe anxiety and depression, News4Jax reports. 

But, over the years, several psychologists have examined him saying he's very intelligent. He was even in a Master's program for pharmacy.
