The glamorous Ukrainian assistant who stole nearly $1million from Nicky Hilton's ex-husband was jailed today for up to three years.

Renata Shamrakova, 28, appeared at Manhattan Supreme Court on Thursday where she was sentenced after pleading guilty to felony grand larceny.

She smiled as she strode into the building wearing a fur-lined coat, tight jeans and black heeled boots. However once inside the courtroom, she dropped the glamorous appearance and changed into a pair of Champion sneakers as she prepared for life behind bars.

She wrapped a beige cardigan tightly around her and placed a copy of Emily Giffin's novel Heart of the Matter on the defense table.

During sentencing, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Jill Konviser said: 'I don't find her to be either remorseful or contrite in any way shape or form.'

Shamrakova's legal team asked that she serve her sentence at Rikers Island but the judge refused and sent her to a prison upstate.

Shamrakova embezzled $821,000 from financier Todd Meister while working as his personal assistant in 2011. She had been ordered to repay half the money by today but was unable to do so. 

Her parents had frantically tried to 
sell their upstate New York home so their daughter could avoid jail.

She also made an attempt to raise the money through a social media campaign, which was met with vitriol, abuse and a grand total of $335.

In March, the former PA confessed to taking out 
two American Express cards in Meister's name and spending $900,000 
traveling to Aruba, Canada, France and Italy.

The Ukranian-born swindler spent the 
money while working as his assistant between March 2011 and January 2012. She also claimed to have had an affair with the millionaire.

According to the New York Daily News, in a statement read out by prosecutors today, Meister said: 'She lives in a make believe world, completely unable to discern fact from reality, from fantasy.

'I have never had any relationship outside of work with Renata.'

When she appeared at Manhattan Supreme Court in November to update a judge
 on her progress with the restitution, the 28-year-old revealed that she 
was engaged to mystery man she described only as 'Jewish' and 'with 
dreamy blue eyes'.

'I’m passionately in love,' she told the New York Post. 'I’ve met my match and couldn’t be happier.'

Explaining that her fiancé is in fashion she took a dig at Meister.

'He’s not in finance. I wouldn’t make 
that mistake twice. He is a family man and very devoted. He stuck by me 
through this and I’m so grateful.'

The wedding she was planning in East Hampton will need to be put on hold until she finishes her jail term.

In addition to the credit card fraud,
 Shamrakova also bought thousands of pieces of jewelery which she then 
sold online for cash and paid off the credit cards by writing checks 
from her lover's JPMorgan account without his knowledge.

She
 also tried to spend some of the stolen money on starting up a jewelery 
curating business called Karat & Ice which she called a 'trusted 
carrier of authentic quality designer merchandise'.

In
 previous court appearances, she tried to argue that she was in a relationship with Mr 
Meister, but he denied that, saying: ‘The women I date are far more 
highly educated.’

Meister 
married hotel heiress Nicky Hilton - the younger sister of Paris Hilton -
 when she was 20 and he was 33 years old in Las Vegas after dating for 
three months. The marriage was annulled after 85 days.

Todd Meister was briefly married to Nikki Hilton, the younger sister of Paris Hilton, in 2004
