Hearts cleared the final hurdle to exiting administration and immediately set about fighting their way back to Scottish football’s top level.

Foundation of Hearts chief Ian Murray hailed supporters for rallying round to keep their club from dying - but warned that plenty of hard graft will be required to bring long-term stability to Tynecastle.

The completion of millionaire businesswoman Ann Budge’s £2.5million takeover means the Foundation  - funded by monthly pledges from punters - are now legally committed to raising £1.4m a year towards operating costs.

Done deal: Ann Budge has completed her takeover of Hearts, the Foundation of Hearts has confirmed

Finally something to smile about: Relegated Hearts have new owners and have been taken out of administration

They plan to eventually take ownership 
of the club, but have to repay within five years the ‘capital loan’ 
Budge has issued to fund a CVA at a club left close to extinction by 
former owner Vladimir Romanov.

‘It’s a great relief for supporters,’ 
Murray told Sportsmail. ‘They are the ones who have constantly put their
 hands in their pockets, supported the club and the Foundation.

‘Every
 single Hearts supporter who has done that should congratulate 
themselves. But the hard work starts now for the Foundation because, 
essentially, we have financial commitments to be able to keep the club 
afloat with working capital – and we have to pay Ann back as well.

‘So the key task for the club is to get into a stable financial position and prepare for the Championship next season.’

Starting
 with a completely clean balance sheet, and with the Foundation 
providing funds on top of ticket sales and commercial revenues, it is 
anticipated Hearts will be in a strong position to challenge Rangers for
 the Championship title.

But Murray said: ‘Let’s take on those challenges tomorrow. Today we’re over the line and we’re delighted.’

Battler: Gary Locke's Hearts side has endured a tough season on the pitch

Manager Gary Locke, out of contract in a matter of weeks, has yet to be given any assurances about his future.

Admitting
 that any decision will be entirely down to Budge and her advisers, 
Murray insisted: ‘That’s an unfair question to ask today. Ann will come 
into the club on Monday and start doing the job she needs to do.

‘I’m sure she’ll be having discussions with various people, meeting all the staff and players. That is day one of her new job.

‘Right now we’re just celebrating that everything is done and dusted – and the Lithuanians are no longer involved in Hearts.’

Budge
 also warned of the workload ahead in a statement released on Friday night, 
declaring: ‘I am truly delighted to be able to confirm that I am now the
 proud majority shareholder in Hearts Football Club. It has been a long 
hard struggle to get to this point but together we have achieved our 
goal.

‘The next few months - even years - won’t be easy as we work 
hard to rebuild our club. However, let’s not think about that today - 
let’s just enjoy! I have absolutely no doubt that together we will 
succeed.

‘As the days and weeks unfold we will, of course, share our 
plans for the future. However, as you will all know, we are now into the
 process of making a formal offer for the remaining shares in the club 
and while that process is in train, there are some restrictions on how 
much we can say publicly. So...no press conferences yet, I’m afraid.

‘However, in the meantime, enjoy the moment. This is a great day in the history of our club.’
