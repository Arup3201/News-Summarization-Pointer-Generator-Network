A nationwide manhunt has been launched today to find a teenager who breached a 'gang-bo' injunction.

Leevon Birchall, 19, was one of the first people to be given a 12-month gang injunction in Greater Manchester, which banned him from contacting known associates following a police investigation into into a vicious tit-for-tat gun war.

However, just 48 hours after the court order was imposed, Birchall posted snaps of himself posing defiantly with a teenage friend named in the legal papers.

Taunt: Birchall last took to Twitter on November 14, pictured, where he said he had been across the country despite being subjected to a curfew

Birchall, who was also placed under curfew and barred from contacting any individuals linked to the city's criminal underworld, posted messages taunting police such 'we live the diamond life' and 'f*** the system'.

In the latest message, posted on November 14, he wrote: 'I'm all over the country been wales warrington blackpool and now im on my way to london.'

In another he posted to his 940 followers he wrote: 'police just take the ****out of my life.'

And a third reads: '****** police are scumbags trying to say I wasn't in my house at ten when I was the ******.'

At a hearing on Monday, Birchall, from Salford, Greater Manchester, was sentenced to 84 days imprisonment in his absence and is now wanted by police.

Officers say they are closing in on the fugitive.

He was initially arrested in September along with three other men following a zero tolerance campaign by police against two feuding gangs.

It came after six underworld shootings on homes and cars in just 20 days.

On
October 10, Birchall and Jacob Harrison, also 19, plus other suspects 
Kane Stafford, 21, and Carne Thomasson, 22, were barred by a judge from 
venturing onto the turf of gangland rivals under the terms of a civil 
order.

Hunt: Leevon Birchall has taunted police through Twitter with messages such as 'f*** the system' and posts bragging he has been travelling freely across the country

The injunctions are not criminal convictions but anyone caught breaching the injunction faces up to two years in prison.

Detective Chief Inspector Chris Downey from Greater Manchester Police said today: 'The whole purpose of the injunction is to ensure communities stay safe, by restricting people’s ability take part in any gang-related activity.

'He has breached this civil order and been sentenced for it so he needs to be taken to prison to serve his time.

'We know Birchall has links across Salford and I need to remind people that anyone helping him evade capture may be arrested for perverting the course of justice.

'We also know that Birchall has a large number of followers on Twitter so he needs to know that we will be appealing to them to tell us where he is.'

The turf war broke out in September following a petty dispute between the two gangs which is thought to have arisen out of a minor 'respect' argument.

A window of a car was shot at in a suburban street and later armed police were called to two separate shooting incidents when bullets were fired into houses.

Gang-bo:  Carne Thomasson, 22, left, Kane Stafford, 21, centre, and Jacob Harrison, 19, right, were also subjected to the gang injunction after a zero tolerance campaign by police against two feuding gangs.
