Dramatic new footage released by police shows in greater detail how a four-hour long police chase which travelled across the border between two states came to a head last Thursday.

The video looks like something from an action movie, and shows two men who took officers on a terrifying chase as they hijacked multiple vehicles along the way.

The two men were charged with attempted murder after allegedly stealing three vehicles at gunpoint and hitting a police office with a car during their dramatic dash for freedom across south-east Queensland on Thursday.

The pair were arrested in Tweed Heads following the four hour pursuit from Caboolture to Brisbane, the Gold Coast and into NSW.

New police footage shows the dramatic moment a bare-chested tattooed man emerged from a stolen car and allegedly fired shots at police following a high-speed pursuit across Queensland on Thursday afternoon

Spanning 150 kilometres the chase came to a dramatic end when one of the men jumped out of a blue car and fired shots at police

Spanning 150 kilometres the chase came to a dramatic end when one of the men jumped out of a blue car and fired shots at police.

The other can also be seen leaping from the car and pair make a dash across multiple lanes of traffic, weaving in between cars in an attempt to escape.

The man with the gun appears to fire again at a passing car before his erratic behaviour causes one vehicle to slam into the back of another.

He also caused this crash between another two vehicles when one driver slammed on their brakes

He continued to run across the motorway after being hit by a black car, still fleeing from police

After a bungled attempt to hijack yet another car, the gunman is mowed down by an oncoming car, which also flings the gun from his grip.

Without his weapon he continued running away from police before he is finally pinned down by police, while another officer arrests the second man. 

NSW police, who had been alerted to the men's impending arrival, used road spikes to initially stop their car on the Pacific Motorway near the Tugun tunnel.

The man with the gun was eventually apprehended by police

His younger accomplice was also arrested and the pair were due to front court on Friday

A Queensland police helicopter tracked the men in a blue Mitsubishi Lancer as they travelled down the motorway.

Police say when the car stopped, a 32-year-old man got out armed with a semi-automatic handgun and fired a shot at an officer.

'He then allegedly fired a number of shots at a passing car,' NSW police said.

The gun was knocked out of his hand when he was struck by a car and the officer was able to arrest him.

Police say the car's other occupant, aged 20, was arrested without incident.

The two men have been charged with shooting with intent to murder, discharging a firearm to avoid arrest, attempted carjacking and Skye's Law, which relates to the police pursuit.

Both men have been refused bail an appeared at Tweed Heads Local Court on Friday.

The men are alleged to have begun their crime spree in Caboolture on Thursday morning when they were pulled over by police in an allegedly stolen car

Police say the men fled, hitting an officer's leg with their vehicle. The pair then allegedly stole two more vehicles at gunpoint before driving through the streets of Queensland at high speeds

The men are alleged to have begun their crime spree in Caboolture on Thursday morning when they were pulled over by police in an allegedly stolen car.

Police say they fled, hitting an officer's leg with their vehicle. The men then allegedly stole two more vehicles at gunpoint.

The second vehicle, a 4WD, had a woman and a young child inside, with the gunmen reportedly demanding the woman remove the child before they drove off.

They are believed to have ditched the 4WD after realising it was low on fuel and stole a third car, the Lancer, then began their high-speed journey south.
