Hong Minh Truong, who is accused of sending more than 500 hoax letters containing white powder to schools and government offices around the U.S.

A Texas man accused of sending more than 500 hoax letters over a six year period containing a white powder to government buildings in the U.S. and around the world has been arrested.

Hong Minh Truong, from Rowlett near Dallas, was detained on Monday and made an initial appearance in Dallas Federal Court after he was charged in a criminal complaint with false information and hoaxes.

It is alleged he sent more than 500 hoax letters with terrorism threats that contained the powder, which recipients may have thought was anthrax, to schools, government offices and day care centers.

In addition he is accused of mailing letters to cities across the U.S. and to American embassies abroad.

More recently some of the letters were sent to hotels in the vicinity of this year's Superbowl, which was held at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey.

It is alleged that the 66-year-old sent 15 batches of letters containing the hoax threats from the Dallas area starting in 2008 and in all but two batches, the powder was sent too.

According to Fox News, in one letter, he is accused of writing that he would hijack a plane at Dallas Love Field airport to hit the NASA Center or the Empire State Building.

One of the letters from May 2012 contained the statement: 'Al Qaeda back! Special thing for you.

'What the hell where are you Scooby Doo, Counter Intelligence, CIA, you do not know how to catch the triple dealer spy in your law enforcement. What the hell where are you Scooby Doo, Internal Affairs, FBI, you don't know how to arrest the bad cop in your law enforcement.

'You all flaming idiot, ignorant and arrogant, know nothing! How to protect this country! U.S.A

'We are Al Qaeda, U.B.L FBI, Al Qaeda, SS Nazi FBI, working in your agency. We claim everything.'

In one of the letters, it is alleged Truong said he would hijack a plane at Dallas Love Field airport and hit the Nasa Center or Empire State Building

Investigators focused on Truong after an IP address associated with him was identified after 28 public schools in Boston received letters in June 2013, according to the complaint.

It is thought Truong was then tracked to a post office in the town of Garland, after it was found he had used the same type of envelopes, same style of writing in the letters and positioned the stamp in the same place.

In a statement Diego Rodriguez, special agent in charge of the FBI's Dallas office said: 'While it was determined that the mailings did not contains toxins or poisons, each incident required a field screening of the letter's contents, which cost taxpayers dollars and diverted first responder resources.'

A judge ordered that Truong should be held in custody until a detention hearing on August 4.

His attorney did not immediately return a message on Monday.

If he is convicted he could face up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
