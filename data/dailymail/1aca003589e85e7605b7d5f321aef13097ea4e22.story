Jack Colback, Calum Chambers, Danny Rose and Fabian Delph are included in a new-look 22-man party.

Tottenham winger Andros Townsend returns to the squad after missing the World Cup through injury and there is also a place for Everton's 20-year-old defender John Stones.

Fresh: Calum Chambers has been named in the England squad after an impressive start to his Arsenal career

England face Norway in a friendly at Wembley on Wednesday before travelling to Basle to kick off their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign against Switzerland on September 8. 

Chambers has caught the eye at Arsenal since his £12million move from Southampton and has earned a call-up despite the concerns of Gunners boss Arsene Wenger.

Rose has been rewarded for his good early-season form with Tottenham and Delph comes into the squad because of his progress at Aston Villa.

It is Colback's call-up which comes as the biggest surprise.

In black and white: Jack Colback has been drafted into the England squad following a series of injuries 

The Newcastle midfielder, who hasn't represented his country at Under 21 level, has rarely been mentioned as a possible candidate for England duty, but Hodgson's hand has been forced by a series of injuries.

Despite being tipped to join the new batch of youngsters, Southampton starlet James Ward-Prowse missed out.

Kyle Walker (pelvis), Ross Barkley (knee), Theo Walcott (knee), Glen Johnson (thigh), Luke Shaw (hamstring), Michael Carrick (ankle), Jon Flanagan (knee), Adam Lallana (knee), Chris Smalling (groin), Kieran Gibbs (hamstring), Jay Rodriguez (knee) and Andy Carroll (ankle) are all missing through injury.

And with Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole having now retired, there is an obvious lack of experience in the squad, which is set to meet on Sunday night. 

Welcome along: Fabian Delph and Danny Rose have been named in the squad to face Norway and Switzerland

Goalkeepers: Fraser Forster (Southampton), Ben Foster (West Bromwich Albion), Joe Hart (Manchester City)

Defenders: Leighton Baines (Everton), Gary Cahill (Chelsea), Calum Chambers (Arsenal), Phil Jagielka (Everton), Phil Jones (Manchester United), Danny Rose (Tottenham Hotspur), John Stones (Everton)

Midfielders: Jack Colback (Newcastle United), Fabian Delph (Aston Villa), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), James Milner (Manchester City), Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Arsenal), Raheem Sterling (Liverpool), Andros Townsend (Tottenham Hotspur), Jack Wilshere (Arsenal)

Forwards: Rickie Lambert (Liverpool), Wayne Rooney (Manchester United), Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool), Danny Welbeck (Manchester United)
