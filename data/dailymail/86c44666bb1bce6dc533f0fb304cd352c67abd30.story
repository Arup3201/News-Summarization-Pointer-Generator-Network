Nearly half of children have reached the age of 11 without using public transport - and most children now have mobile phones

Today's children are so cosseted that nearly half have never set foot on a bus or train, a major study reveals today.

The research paints a picture of a gadget-obsessed generation who spend hours in front of screens but enjoy limited freedom.

It found 48 per cent had reached the age of 11 without ever travelling on public transport – even with an adult.

But more than one in six spent at least three hours a day watching television or DVDs on a computer.

For the most heavily addicted, the daily time spent in front of a screen could add up to seven hours.

The findings come from the state-funded Millennium Cohort Study, which is tracking 13,000 British children born in 2000, 2001 or 2002.

A snapshot taken when the participants were 11 shows the extent to which childhoods have changed in half a generation.

Three-quarters now have their own mobile phone and six in ten have a television in their bedroom.

Contact with friends is just as likely to be via technology – either mobile phone calls or social networking sites – as it is to be face-to-face.

‘Social media undoubtedly plays a central role in the lives of most of these children,’ the study said.

‘With the evolution of social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, friends have become redefined as not only those they see but virtual friends.

‘Communication with many of them exists solely in a virtual world.’

Despite this, not all children were constantly using social media. The study found 46 per cent of boys and 31 per cent of girls never messaged their friends. Researchers asked parents were how much freedom they gave their children to make journeys on their own around the local area.

‘The survey clearly showed the ever-greater reliance on the family car for all journeys,’ the report said. ‘Very few children had travelled on public transport on their own (four per cent), while a surprisingly high proportion (48 per cent) had never even travelled on public transport with an adult.’

More than one in six spent at least three hours a day watching television or on a computer, a study revealed

Just over half of boys and 44 per cent of girls were allowed to make journeys on their own on foot. Boys were also more likely to be allowed to play unsupervised with their friends.

Fifty-one per cent said they did so most weekends compared to 43 per cent of girls. Around a quarter of parents did not allowed their children any unsupervised time with friends.

The study also shed light on tensions within the family. Twenty-nine per cent of parents said they had ‘frequent battles’ with their 11-year-old.

And around one in ten disciplined their children by sending them to their bedrooms or denying them treats.

Previous research has suggested the emergence of a ‘sensible’ generation.

The Millennium Cohort Study echoed these findings, saying the behaviour of 11-year-olds ‘was giving little cause for concern’.

Seventy-six per cent said they had been bullied by a sibling and 58 per cent reported being picked on by another child.

But around half – 52 per cent – rated themselves as being ‘completely happy’.
