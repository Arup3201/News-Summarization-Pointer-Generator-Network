A prolific pool of 500 British sperm donors is responsible for fathering more than 6,000 children, new fertility figures have revealed.

All have sired at least 10 children - while 15 have fathered 20 or more. But none of the men are obliged to give their identity to the children, as all of them were born before 2005, ahead of a change in the law requiring donors to reveal themselves if are asked.

The so-called 'super-dads' offered the 
only hope to infertile couples, said the Human Fertilisation and 
Embryology Authority (HEFA), which is looking for more volunteers to 
come forward.

Donors are not the legal father and have not rights or obligations unless they provide sperm through an unlicensed clinic.

They are only allowed to give their 
sperm to ten different women.

The topic has recently been brought into focus by new Hollywood movie Delivery Man, starring Vince Vaughn, who finds out he has fathered hundreds of kids.

They petition the sperm bank to find out his identity and he has to decide whether to tell them.

A spokeswoman for HEFA said that, while the number of donors is increasing in Britain, more are needed.

'Donation is an altruistic act,' she said. 'Sperm from donors can only be used to create to up to ten families and the recruitment process is and will remain a rigorous one.

'Clinics subject all samples to extensive genetic testing.'

The figures reveal that exactly 500 anonymous donors have fathered ten or more kids each â€” a total of 6,111.

Of these, eight have fathered 20 children and seven even more.

About 2,000 children are born every year in the UK using donated eggs, sperm or embryos.

Sperm donors are also used to promote advances in the treatment of infertility and increase knowledge of serious diseases.
