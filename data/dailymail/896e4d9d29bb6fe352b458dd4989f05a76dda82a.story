Gemma Sheridan, who unwittingly became the centre of an internet sensation after her name was used in a story about a castaway on a desert island

A woman who supposedly survived on a desert island by drinking rainwater from coconut shells and killing a goat with a clam shell for food, has revealed that the whole story was a hoax.

Gemma Sheridan's story of rescue went viral when her image was posted online and shared and retweeted hundreds of thousands of times.

The accompanying story claimed that she and two friends set sail from Merseyside to Hawaii in 2007 but hit a freak storm in which her friends were blown overboard and died.

But the tale was merely a prank, played upon the 26-year-old by her friends, mocking her comparatively simple lifestyle to the internet fantasy they had concocted for her.

According to the story, posted on news-hound.org, Miss Sheridan, from Widnes, Cheshire, was eventually rescued when she made a giant SOS sign on the beach and it was spotted by 'a kid from Minnesota on Google Earth'.

The article has since been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.

'The people behind the website are just good friends with a strange sense of humour and busy brain,' she said.

'They posted the story then messaged me saying they were going to make me famous. I thought the story was a good one and it made me laugh.'

Referring to the goat-killing story, she said: 'I can't kill a spider never mind smash a goat's head in.'

She added: 'I thought it would get a few likes but didn't expect this.

'A surprising amount of people thought it was real. I feel bad disappointing them but it's just a laugh.'

The story claimed Miss Sheridan, from Widnes, had been marooned on a desert island near Hawaii for seven years and that her SOS sign was spotted on Google Earth by a 'kid in Minnesota'

Miss Sheridan, a saleswoman, said her real life with her boyfriend and dog was far from her internet castaway adventure.

'My
 friend at news-hound had been skitting me about how happy I was with my
 simple lifestyle, which is probably another reason behind them writing 
such a ridiculous story about me.

The
 original story - 'Google Earth Finds Woman Trapped on Deserted Island' -
 claims Miss S makeshift SOS message was finally found thanks to Google 
Earth.

But the tale was merely a prank played upon the 26-year-old by her friends (who also superimposed this picture of her onto the body of a castaway), mocking her comparatively simple lifestyle to the internet fantasy life they had concocted for her

In reality, the image is from a 2010 Amnesty International report on violence in Kyrgyzstan - the uncropped picture shows buildings in the background.

Adding to the hoax, the details of her survival are not only fake but plagiarised - with huge chunks lifted from the survival experience of actual explorer Ed Stafford.

For the record, Miss Sheridan has no sailing experience and no imminent plans to recreate her fictional adventure.
