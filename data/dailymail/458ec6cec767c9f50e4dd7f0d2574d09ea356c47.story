Scientists have discovered a prehistoric species of armoured predatory fish with 'legs' in a 370million year old fossil.

Archaeologists uncovered the ancient creature while studying sandstone deposits in a section of road in north central Pennsylvania.

It is believed to be from the late Devonian period, at a time 
long before dinosaurs walked the Earth – but, geologically speaking, not
long before the very first species began to walk on land.

Fossils of armored fishes like this one, a phyllolepid placoderm, are known for the distinctive ornamentation of 'leg-like' ridges on their exterior plates.

Using a method more familiar to crime scene investigators, Dr
Ted Daeschler, of Drexel University, managed to create a copy of the 
fossil with a rubber cast made by pouring latex into its natural 
impression in the rock.

Placodermi is an extinct class of armoured prehistoric fish, known from fossils, which lived from the late Silurian to the end of the Devonian Period.

Their head and thorax were covered by articulated armoured plates and the rest of the body was scaled or naked, depending on the species.

Placoderms were among the first jawed fish; their jaws likely evolved from the first of their gill arches.

A 380-million-year-old fossil of one species represents the oldest known example of live birth

This placoderm, named 
Phyllolepis thomsoni, is one of two new Devonian fish species presented by Daeschler in the Bicentennial issue of the Proceedings of the Academy
of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.

The other new species is a lobe-finned fish discovered in northern Canada.

Once the latex hardened, Dr Daeschler peeled it out and dusted its surface with a fine powder to better show the edges of the bony plates and the shapes of fine ridges on the fish's bony armor – a lot like dusting for fingerprints to show minute ridges left on a surface.

Dr Daeschler and colleagues were then better able to prepare a detailed scientific description of the new species

Dr Daeschler has dug for Devonian species in Pennsylvania since 1993, and in northern Canada since 1999.

His work helps to explain how the first vertebrate species with limbs evolved.

The Phyllolepis thomsoni,species has been named in honor of Dr. Keith S. Thomson, a colleague of Dr Daeschler.
