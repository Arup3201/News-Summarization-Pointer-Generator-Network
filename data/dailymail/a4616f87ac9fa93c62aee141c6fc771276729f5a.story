Large numbers of migrants living in the UK cannot speak fluent English -  placing huge strain on schools and the NHS.

Official figures found that up to a third of people from the biggest migrant communities in Britain cannot speak English well.

Analysis of information from the  2011 census of England and Wales  showed that migrants are less likely to have good health if they do not speak English well.

Concerns: Large numbers of migrants living in the UK cannot speak fluent English -  placing huge strain on schools and the NHS. This picture was taken in Boston, which has seen an influx of migrants

The figures also highlighted the extra burden schools face in teaching children who speak different languages.

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Paul Kenny, the mayor of Boston Borough Council, which has
seen a huge influx of Eastern European migrants in the area, said: 'I am mindful 
that it can put a strain on resources. About five years ago, our schools
 were really struggling.

'They are better equipped to deal with 
these issues now, but I think we’ve still got a long way to go with the 
issue of trying to make sure that we get more integration, and teaching 
English as a second language is vital.'

The figures revealed those who speak Polish as their main language make up the largest group other than native English speakers.

Worrying: Highlighting the additional strain placed on the NHS, third of migrants unable to speak English fluently were in poor health

However, more than a quarter of that population group, said their English was either not good or non-existent.

For people whose principal tongue was Urdu or Gujarati it was a similar figure.The census also showed that nearly a third of native Punjabi and Bengali speakers also could not speak English fluently.

Highlighting the additional strain placed on the NHS, a third of migrants unable to speak English fluently were in poor health.

The figures showed that for 92 per cent of people aged three and over, English was the main language.

A total of 726,000 people in the UK cannot speak English fluently with 138,000 who unable to speak it at all.

In the UK there are 88 main languages spoken other than English . Polish is the largest group with 546,000 speakers.
