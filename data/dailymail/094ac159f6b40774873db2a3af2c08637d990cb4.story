Tributes have been paid to a 'kind and caring' private school pupil who has been found dead at her home.

The death of Sophie Parkinson, 13, has left pupils and staff at her school in Dundee 'stunned and saddened' after police were alerted on Saturday morning.

A friend of Sophie suggested in a message posted online that she may have been bullied before her death, however her family say they do not believe this to be the case.

Dr John Halliday, rector at the High School of Dundee, also said he does not believe bullying in the school had taken place or been a factor in the tragedy.

The second year pupil, who was a talented young actress, died at her home in Liff, just outside Dundee.

Police have said there are no suspicious circumstances and a report would be submitted to the procurator fiscal.

Dr Halliday today said support was being provided to the youngster's classmates and teachers.

He said: 'Sophie was a popular and talented pupil, kind and caring, with a loyal group of close friends.

'Her huge smile and generous personality left an indelible mark on all those she encountered.

'Her vivid imagination meant she was particularly able in English, but she also loved cooking, achieving success in a local chef competition, and was a talented young actor, amongst many other things.

'We will all miss her hugely. Sophie will live long in our hearts and minds.

'Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with her family and friends at this very difficult time.

'We are doing what we can to support them, and have also set up a system for supporting our pupils and staff as they come to terms with this tragic news.

'Given the situation we would ask that everyone outside the school respect the family's request for privacy at this time.'

Dr Halliday said he did not believe bullying had taken place in the school.

He said: 'We cannot control what appears on social media. However, the school has well-established, rigorous and effective pupil welfare policies in place and we do not believe that bullying in the school environment has taken place or been a factor in this awful tragedy.

'The happiness and welfare of every 
single pupil is our first priority and we go to great length to get it 
right for every child.

'We
 treat any suggestion of bullying with the utmost seriousness and it is 
our practice to review our policies and procedures regularly and in 
particular when a terrible tragedy such as this happens.'

Parents of children at the school received notification of Sophie's passing in letters from the school.

The school's flag is at half mast and a book of remembrance has been set up.

Sophie's friends have also paid tribute on social networking sites, which appeared to include a suggestion she had been bullied.

One friend wrote: 'Heaven gained an angel. Sophie Parkinson 2000-2014 March 1. Never forgotten.

'RIP. Three words... bullying ruins lives.'

Another said: 'Rest in peace Sophie Parkinson. Heaven's gained another angel. Sleep tight.'

A police source has said that there was nothing to suggest bullying was a factor but that inquiries were continuing.

Sophie lived in the hamlet of Liff, Angus, a few miles north-west of Dundee, with her mother and elder brother.
