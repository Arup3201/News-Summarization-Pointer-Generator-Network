Jose Mourinho and his trusted backroom staff have a habit of badgering fourth officials and sparking touchline bust-ups with opposing benches.

As Mourinho continues to create a siege mentality inside the Chelsea dressing room, there's little doubt that his inner circle will be backing every move the Blues boss makes.

Here, Sportsmail discloses everything you need to know about Mourinho's sidekicks as they fight another battle against the rest of the Premier League.

RUI FARIA 

Rui Faria is a fitness coach with whom Mourinho worked closely at Porto, and took to Inter Milan and Real Madrid following his first spell at Stamford Bridge.

The Portguese hired his compatriot Faria as a coach and video analyst when he was with minnows Leiria and the two have been inseparable since.

Faria's responsibilities far exceed that of a traditional fitness coach, and he is often spotted out with Mourinho and even driving him around.

Faria is alleged to have been the member of staff illegally communicating with Mourinho when the manager was banned by UEFA from a Champions League game against Bayern Munich in 2005.

Mourinho is said to have snuck into the stadium and given instructions to Faria via a headset, before being wheeled out in a laundry trolley.

The 39-year-old is known for being Chelsea's biggest pest to fourth officials and opposing dugouts. Only last week, after a 2-1 victory against Aston Villa, did Paul Lambert accuse a member of Mourinho's team - believed to be Faria - of being verbally abusive.

Faria was hit with a six-match ban after Chelsea's 2-1 defeat against Sunderland last season following an angry outburst towards referee Mike Dean.

STEVE HOLLAND

Holland was appointed reserve team manager in 2009 and has worked his way up to being an assistant first-team coach.

Usually a calm and personable character, Holland has been accused of sinking to Mourinho's level with certain actions on the touchline in recent weeks as the the Chelsea boss continues to create a siege mentality. 

Holland worked under Andre Villas-Boas, Roberto Di Matteo and Rafael Benitez before Mourinho's return in 2013. 

Faria allegedly gave Holland a briefing on how to help Chelsea beat Barcelona during the Champions League campaign last year, while Mourinho sent several players good luck texts.

SILVINO LOURO 

Goalkeeping coach turned assistant first-team coach Silvino Louro, who was the man between the sticks for Benfica in the 1988 and 1990 European Cup finals has also been at the Special One's side at every club he has managed.

With Christophe Lollichon taking charge of the goalkeepers' coaching, Louro's role largely involves player interaction and specific training drills.

Louro is clearly heavily involved in Chelsea's set-piece practice as Mourinho praised his colleague following Oscar's brilliant free-kick against Crystal Palace last October. 

The 55-year-old also seems to be Mourinho's calmest lieutenant and is rarely at the forefront of a touchline bust-up.

CHRISTOPHE LOLLICHON

Lollichon joined in 2007 from Rennes, where he had previously worked with veteran Blues stopper, Petr Cech.

The Frenchman did not play at the top level, but has seen huge success during his time in west London.

There were rumours that Lollichon, a close friend of Cech, would leave during the summer as Thibaut Courtois began his career as Chelsea's No 1. 

Despite being in Mourinho's matchday dugout to assist the goalkeepers, Lollichon is often very quick to harass the fourth official. Perhaps one of the worst touchline tantrum offenders alongside Mourinho and Faria.

CHRIS JONES 

Jones is the club's first-team fitness coach, and was named by Mourinho as staying at Stamford Bridge ahead of his second spell at Stamford Bridge.

He works alongside Faria on the conditioning of the team after being promoted to his current role when Villas-Boas was sacked as manager in 2012.

After graduating from Loughborough University with a sports science degree, Jones moved to Chelsea in 2006 after spending three years at neighbours Fulham.

He began working with the academy and youth teams under Mourinho, moving up to first-team duties upon the arrival of Carlo Ancelotti in 2009.

Jones, who has also worked with England U19s and U21s, joins a line of British Mourinho graduates at Chelsea following Steve Clarke, the former West Brom boss now at Reading, and Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers.

MICHAEL EMENALO 

The former Nigeria international joined Chelsea in 2007 when Avram Grant was manager. Grant recruited the former defender from the Tucson Soccer Academy in Arizona, where he had been in charge of the Under 12s girls’ team for little more than a year.

Emenalo’s first job at Chelsea was as head opposition scout but he was promoted to the first-team coaching staff last year and has made a positive impression on key figures at the club, including owner Roman Abramovich.

In 2011, the 49-year-old then became Chelsea's technical director and has since been key to the majority of Chelsea's transfer dealings.

There has been a debate that Emenalo's close relationship with Abramovich has unsettled previous Chelsea managers, but the Nigerian seems to have a good relationship with Mourinho and will often be spotted sitting just behind the Chelsea dugout at Stamford Bridge.

EVA CARNEIRO AND JON FEARN

Chelsea first-team doctor Eva Carneiro studied medicine at Nottingham University before working in emergency surgery in the Highlands. She studied in Australia, did an MSc in London and a thesis at West Ham.

After working at the British Olympic Medical Institute, helping athletes at the Beijing Olympics, and with the England women’s football team. She joined the Blues in 2009 as reserve-team doctor before Andre Villas-Boas brought her into the first-team fold in 2011.

Carneiro is clearly having an effect on the Blues squad as Mourinho has been able to name his first-choice XI for the majority of the season. 

First team physiotherapist Jon Fearn joined Chelsea in 2010 from Reading and now occupies a place on the bench alongside Carneiro.

Fearn spent eight years with the Royals under Alan Pardew, Steve Coppell and Brendan Rodgers.
