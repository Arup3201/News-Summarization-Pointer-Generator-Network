If someone suggested you spent a well-earned holiday in a garden shed, you'd perhaps politely decline.

But now more and more people are opting to spend their precious time off in £2,000 a week luxury 'boltholes' - which are strikingly similar to the humble garden shed.

Hundreds of the boltholes have been built in some of the country's most rural areas to cater for the rise in people staying in the UK for their holidays - known as 'staycationers'.

Many of the charming rooms, some just a 
few metres wide, are being rented to for up to £2,000 a week and some 
are bringing in as much as in £100,000 annually.

A specialist website that handles the converted timber shacks says it is struggling to keep up with demand, - with most of the quaint holiday homes now let-out for most of the year.

The site, Unique Home Stays, lists 37 two-man boltholes, around half of which are located in the popular tourist areas of Cornwall and Devon.

Others are dotted around Britain in picturesque areas such as the Peak District, Shropshire, the Isle of Wight and the Scottish Highlands.

Claire Ray, spokeswoman for the company, said today: 'We have special properties of all sizes but the ones that do the best are the sleeps-two boltholes.

'People are tripping over themselves to book them.

'These romantic boltholes come from the most unlikely of beginnings, from run-down sheds to old beach huts.

'They are turned into luxury hideaways and they are proving a real hit because they offer couples privacy, seclusion, luxury and romance in unique settings.'

What started out as a showroom for her interior design company ended up becoming a real money maker for mother-of-two Kerrie Griffin-Rogers.

She spent just £10,000 turning a roofless, disused garage at her house in Shropshire into a £3,200 a month retreat.

The 46-year-old had found herself struggling to pay the bills and her large mortgage.

But now the income from the renovated garage, called Turtledove Hideaway in Shropshire, pays the £300,000 mortgage on her 136-acre estate - and more.

Speaking outside the bolthole, Mrs Griffin-Rogers said: 'I was using the garage to store products for my interior design company but it didn’t have a roof and birds were making a mess in there.

'I decided to renovate the garage and use it to show off my products.

'I did most of the work myself and didn’t skimp on anything - it is all the best you can get.

'The house was featured in a few magazines and they suggested I looked into letting it out through Unique Home Stays.

'It went onto their site in the middle of May and the first booking came in five days later.

'Bookings have been coming in thick and fast since then.

'Each month I’m getting about £3,200 just from letting out the hideaway which is double my mortgage.'

It cost Adam Wooler just £6,500 to buy a ramshackle timber shed perched on the top of a 300ft cliff overlooking Whitsand Bay in Cornwall.

Adam bought the derelict shack while at university 25 years ago, and it remained unused for long after.

But now he and wife Katherine have invested £100,000 into turning it into a luxury, cosy bolthole that has a kitchen, lounge, bedroom, shower room and sun terrace.

The chalet, called The Edge, is booked up until the end of summer and costs up to £1,500 to hire for a week, pictured in its current glory below.

Mr Wooler, 47, who runs a marine services business, said: 'I worked as a lifeguard on the beach below and bought the leasehold for the chalet for £6,500.

'I just bought it to live in it while I was at Plymouth University.

'It was nothing more than an wooden shack on a cliff with one room and an outside loo. It was three metres by two metres and nothing more than a shed.

'I lived in it for 18 months and nearly got blown away with it a few times.

'I left it as it was for 25 years and couldn’t really afford to do anything with it.

'It has only been the last 18 months that we managed to get the funding and planning permission in place that we could really do something with it.

'We are delighted with how it has turned out and has been designed to make the most of the views. It is really romantic getaway.

'People are happy to pay the rental price for it because of the views and the high standard finish.'

Former TV producer Jan Bright, right, spent £150,000 doing up three decrepit 600-year-old barns on her Cornish farm - and now rakes in £81,000 a year in revenue.

Mrs Bright, 61, was among the first to list a property with Unique Home Stays after buying the 2.5 acre Grade II listed Drym Farm near St Ives in 2002.

Her three renovated eco-homes - Quillet Cottage, the Apple Store and Lofty - all pictured after and before renovation below, cost up to £900 a week to rent.

She is now planning the renovation of two more barns on the site which would take her income from the lettings to £135,000.

Mrs Bright said: 'I bought the farm with the pure intention to renovate the barns.

'They were beautiful stone buildings but they were totally derelict.

'I was adamant I wanted them to retain their rustic charm and still look like 600-year-old barns.

'It took a lot of work, made harder because the buildings are listed, but it was worth every second.

'Each cottage brings in around £27,000 a year. I’m delighted and my accountant is too.'
