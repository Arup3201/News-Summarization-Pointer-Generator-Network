Arsenal have deployed chief scout Steve Rowley to watch Tyrone Mings as they plot a move for the Ipswich left back.

Mings has flourished this season after the departure of Aaron Cresswell to West Ham and is attracting strong interest from the Gunners, who also had scout Pat Holland run the rule over him at their match against Watford at the weekend.

But they face stiff competition from Manchester United, Everton and Newcastle, who are all understood to have had him monitored.

The 21-year-old came through the youth ranks at Southampton with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain but was released by the club in 2009 and has worked his way back up from non-League.

He first moved to Yate Town before joining Chippenham Town, where Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy plucked him from for just £10,000 in 2012.

But Ipswich could be set to cash in with the club thought to now want up to £10million for the player who won Championship player of the month in September.

Mings, who can also play right back and could develop into a centre half, has only just signed a three-year contract with Ipswich, tying him to the club until the summer of 2017.

Mings has developed a reputation for his charitable acts.

When he changed his shirt number to three, taking over from Cresswell, in the summer he refunded fans who had just bought shirts with his old No 15 on their back.

And last year he gave away two tickets to a fan who tweeted that he could not afford to watch a game at Ipswich's Portman Road.
