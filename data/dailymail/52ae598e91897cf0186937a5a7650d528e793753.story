A man fatally shot his estranged wife in the parking lot of a parochial school in northwestern Indiana and later killed himself at his home after a police officer confronted him, police said.

Officers responding to a report of shots fired outside St. Mary's Catholic School about 4:30 p.m. Monday found Nina Castro, 42, lying in the parking lot with a gunshot wound, Griffith Police Chief Greg Mance said.

She and her 16-year-old daughter had been collecting her 14-year-old son from an after-school program, Mance said. The shooting took place in front of the couple's two teenage children, he said.

Remanard Castro, 55, fled the scene on a motorcycle and headed to his home in the neighboring city of Gary, Mance said.

Gary Police Chief Wade Ingram said an officer found Castro with a handgun in the garage of the house and ordered him to drop the weapon, but Castro shot himself.

'The Gary officer made contact with Mr. Castro. After disobeying the officer's command, Mr. Castro turned the gun on himself and administered a fatal self-inflicted wound,' said Chief Greg Mance, Griffith Police Department.

The Rev. Theodore Mens, pastor of St. Mary's, said Castro's son helped with the after-school religious program and that the daughter, who used to attend the school, is now a sophomore at Bishop Noll Institute in Hammond.

'This tragedy indicates that all of us, individually and as a society, have to make better decisions than we do in general,' Mens said.

The couple was divorcing, with a final hearing scheduled for June 10, according to Lake County court records.
