House prices in Britain will not return to their pre-recession peak until the end of the decade, making this the longest slump in the property market since records began.

A report by a leading estate agent said the price of the average home peaked at £183,959 in 2007 but has fallen so dramatically it will not return to this level until 2019.

The 12-year recovery period could be the longest since records began in the 1950s.

The report said that once the impact of inflation is stripped out, average prices will not return to 2007 levels until 2031 – an incredible 24 years after they peaked.

In contrast, house prices in the most expensive areas of central London have already clawed back all their losses and are now at record highs as rich Brits and foreigners plough money into the capital.

Grainne Gilmore, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, which produced the report, said: ‘Some five years after the start of the financial crisis, the housing sector in the UK still does not bear the hallmarks of a fully functioning market.’

In the previous market crash, prices peaked at £62,782 in 1989 and did not reach that level again until 1998 – a nine year slump.

Miss Gilmore said the current downturn was even worse in part due to the sharp fall in transactions triggered by a shortage of mortgage lending.

‘Transaction levels have roughly halved since the last market peak in 2007, and are 35 per cent below the 20-year average, as first-time buyers and those further up the housing ladder struggle with tighter mortgage lending rules,’ she said.

House prices fell by around 15 per cent as the financial crisis struck in 2008 and have barely recovered since then.

Knight Frank said prices fell two per cent last year and predicted another two per cent fall this year before a meagre one per cent rise in 2014.

Prices are expected to fall in every region of the UK in 2013 with Scotland and Wales suffering declines of more than three per cent.

Miss Gilmore said: ‘We do not see average prices reaching their 2007 peak again until 2019 – which would mark the longest period between price peaks in more than 60 years.

'Once inflation is stripped out, average UK house prices are unlikely to hit 2007 levels again in real terms until 2031.’

However, the report painted a different picture in central London where ‘prime’ house prices –those worth around £2million or more – rose 8 per cent last year following a 12.1 per cent jump in 2010. 

Prices in upmarket areas such as Mayfair and Kensington are expected to be flat this year before rising by another 4 per cent in 2014, according to Knight Frank.

A report last week named Egerton Crescent in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea the most expensive street in Britain – with the average house price topping £8million.

Liam Bailey, global head of residential research at Knight Frank, said: ‘As always the average position across the UK has disguised the performance of different submarkets, and none has been more different than the central London market.

‘Prime property prices in central London have bucked the trend of the wider housing market in the UK over the past few years.

‘The demand for luxury London homes from overseas buyers looking for a safe-haven for their money, as well as a slice of London life has helped drive price increases.’

Billionaires' row: Despite house values falling across the UK, values in London's most expensive area are at record highs. A report last showed that Egerton Crescent is the most expensive street in the UK with the average property costing over £8million
