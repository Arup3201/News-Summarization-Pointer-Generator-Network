A man ended up in court after branding another man a paedophile on Facebook.

Joseph Griffin, 43, of Hartlepool, County Durham, updated his Facebook status with an offensive comment directed at his victim and also posted the man's name and address on the social networking site.

Hartlepool Magistrates heard yesterday how the post was displayed for about an hour and a half before being removed.

Hauled before court: Joseph Griffin, 43, from Hartlepool, branded another man a paedophile on Facebook

Prosecuting, Alan Davison said: 'Mr Griffin has a Facebook account and he updated a post upon that account by making a remark for the world to see, effectively.

'He called him a paedophile and made threats to him.

'He then went on to type his name and address.'

He added: 'Mr Griffin told police that he had a Facebook account and admitted he had put comments on about this man because he was angry and frustrated.

'He has no previous convictions in the last 10 years.'

The slur was posted on Facebook along with the man's address

Mr Griffin pleaded guilty to sending by public communication network an offensive, indecent, obscene, or menacing message or matter, namely a Facebook status, on August 17.

Mitigating, Andrew Blair told justices: 'He is currently unemployed but carries out voluntary work in the community and lives with his wife and six children, two of his own and four of his wife's.

'He accepts he's posted this particular comment on Facebook.

'It was up on Facebook for an hour-and-a-half before it was removed.

'It's a single message which has been posted and removed fairly quickly.'

Chairman of the bench Peter Heron fined Griffin £50, ordered him to pay £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
