Builder Len Chandler feared that he was going to lose his foot after doctors told him that he had a hole in his heel.

The 71 year old, from Rutherglen, Victoria had a rare form of cancer in the calcaneus, which had eaten through the heel of his foot and caused him difficulty walking.

Thankfully for Len, it hadn't spread any further.

'It'd been annoying for about 6, 7 years,' he said.

'I went to so many different specialists, physiotherapists, podiatrists and acupuncturists and I was just about to give up.'

Melbourne-based implant manufacturer Anatomics was brought in and created a mirror-image design to help in the creation of a new heel, the CSIRO used its state-of-the-art Arcam 3D printer to build the implant from titanium

Finally, after an x-ray at a local hospital he was referred to St Vincent's Hospital surgeon Professor Peter Choong in Melbourne, who was at the time developing techniques with 3D printing. 

Dr Choong offered him the chance to save his foot from being amputated as most people with this type of cancer often lose the leg below the knee because it is difficult to replace the heel bone.

'I was prepared to lose it but this fantastic machine offered me the chance to save it,' he said. 

He then underwent a pioneering procedure using a titanium heel made in a 3D printer, what's believed to be a world first of it's kind. 

'I never knew the operation would be this successful or this important,' says Mr Chandler.

'I thought it might be the first time this had been done in Victoria.'

'I didn't realise it would be the first time in the world.'

'Other poor blokes that have had this cancer have probably had their foot off,' he said. 'But I'm still going and it looks quite alright.'

A team led by Prof Choong used scans of Len's left heel bone to create a 3D image of his right one.

Melbourne-based implant manufacturer Anatomics was brought in and created a mirror-image design to help in the creation of a new heel.

The CSIRO used its state-of-the-art Arcam 3D printer to build the implant from titanium.

Prof Choong, St Vincent's Director of Orthopaedics, is internationally recognised for his expertise and research in bone and soft tissue cancers.

'It's very exciting,' says Dr Choong.

'This is a great example of how advances in science and technology and research can be directed towards meeting a patient's needs.'

Dr Choong says he's spent years dreaming about this type of procedure.

'The idea is one of those things we often fantasise about - can I make something that's exactly like the patient? Anyone in my field constantly thinks about that.'

'Then you see the technology and it clicks.'

'In this particular situation it was very helpful, because that bone that was removed was very complex in its shape and also its function.'

'So having something that replicates that made a world of difference as to what we could actually achieve.'

Andrew Batty from Anatomics said the 3D heel was manufactured from titanium but at a reduced weight to work better for the doctors and the patient.

'The implant was a reduced weight by a range of techniques,' he said.

'Once we had a design prototyped out of plastic we then sent it to the CSIRO to have it machine printed, we got a rough copy back and then we processed it in our laboratory.'

'Now there's a lot of work to be done to start bringing this technology to everyone.'

Len Chandler (pictured) says his foot is pretty good and he has no pain and has praised Dr Peter Choong for helping to develop his custom titanium heel on a 3D printer

CSIRO's John Barnes says these type of projects have been increasing in the last 12 months, but this particular one was the first of it's kind worldwide.

'First time I'm aware of a custom titanium implant,' he said.

'We have the only machine in Australia and we want industry to come and use it, we want people to understand the technology.'

Mr Barnes says this type of technology can benefit a number of patients suffering possible amputation and it has a quick turnover.

'We can make 15 of these ankles in one run, it's a huge benefit of technology.' 

'It's like a stack of cards that has shape, there is an internal support structure and it's easier for doctors to work on.' 

For Len it's done wonders, who is still in awe of the operation that he had to replace his heel and it has given him a better quality of life. 

'Pretty good, no pain, I'm increasing my weight (on the foot) now up to 50%, not travelling too bad,' he said.

The last three weeks have made a difference, I'm confident by Christmas I can give up the sticks, the walking sticks.'

Praising Dr Choong for his hard work in bringing the technology which saved his foot.

'He was outstanding, I didn't realise he was top of the range but he's not a normal person.'

'Lucky to have a man as smart as he is.'
