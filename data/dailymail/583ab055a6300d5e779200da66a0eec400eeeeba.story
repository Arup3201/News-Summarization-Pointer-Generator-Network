The high-profile prosecution of a man suspected of
mugging the husband of millionaire Tamara Ecclestone has been abandoned.

Jay Rutland, 32, was left with nasty cuts to his face
when he was ambushed by two men after stopping his black Ferrari.

The former jet-setting playboy was robbed of a £50,000
Rolex and £20,000 bracelet by at least two thugs.

Case abandoned: Jay Rutland, 32, pictured here with pregnant Tamara Ecclestone in Switzerland, was left with nasty cuts to his face when he was ambushed by two men. The case against a suspect has now been dropped

It later emerged that the isolated petrol station
forecourt is a notorious spot for drug dealers and the entire fracas was caught
on CCTV.

But now, the Daily Mail can reveal the case was dropped three months
after the 21-year-old suspect was arrested and charged.

The prosecution was quietly discontinued without a public
hearing when lawyers wrote to the defence to say they would offer no evidence.

This was despite the fact several court hearings had
already taken place, including one in which the defendant pleaded not guilty.

The suspect was originally traced after dropping his
mobile phone during the scuffle and the victim picked it up and handed it to
police.

But prosecutors said this was the only evidence linking
him to the crime and it would not have been enough to secure a conviction.

Abandoned: The case against one of Tamara Ecclestone's husbands suspected attackers has been ditched because of a lack of evidence

Mr Rutland failed to identify his attacker when he
attended a police identity parade and investigators said the CCTV footage was
of poor quality.

The robbery took place in July last year as Mr Rutland
drove back into Central London along the A12 from Essex.

CCTV footage showed him driving on to the entrance of a
repair shop before a scuffle took place in Wanstead, East London.

The attack took place in a poorly lit area behind a
petrol station that forms part of its forecourt. Minutes later a figure could
be seen searching the ground with a torch.

Mr Rutland said he was driving home when his fuel gauge
started flashing, so he stopped. He went to relieve himself in a corner when he
was approached by two men.

He said they threatened, assaulted and robbed him,
leaving him with a cut above one eye that required medical treatment.

Motor repair shop owner Dave Dodds, 69, whose camera
captured the fracas, said at the time: ‘It's a drug drop-off area at night.

‘I've come back here late when I've forgotten something
and found people here. I've even got video of a gun being handed over.’

A 21-year-old man, of Manor Park, East London, spent
three months on remand after being charged with robbery and possession of a
knife.

The robbery happened in Wanstead in East London last summer as Mr Rutland drove along the A12 from Essex

Mr Rutland said two men threatened, assaulted and robbed him, leaving the 32-year-old with a cut above one eye that required medical treatment

Prosecutors said the only evidence linking the suspect to the crime was a mobile phone, which would have not been enough to secure a conviction

A spokeswoman for Mr Rutland said: ‘Mr Rutland respects
the decision of the CPS. Clearly he is disappointed that the proceedings didn’t
result in a conviction.’

Mr Rutland and Miss Ecclestone, 29, daughter of
billionaire Formula One mogul Bernie, are expecting their first child in the
spring.

A Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) spokesman said the
suspect was charged last July pending evidence that lawyers expected to become
available.

But the case was abandoned in October because there was
‘insufficient evidence to continue’.

He said: ‘With the exception of a mobile phone found at
the scene, there was no substantial evidence that could have linked the suspect
to the alleged offending.

‘The mobile phone, while significant, could not (in the
absence of any other evidence) conclusively establish who had been present.

‘There was no CCTV or automatic number plate recognition
evidence that could identify the suspect and he was not selected by the
complainant during identification procedures.

‘In light of this, we decided to discontinue the case.’
