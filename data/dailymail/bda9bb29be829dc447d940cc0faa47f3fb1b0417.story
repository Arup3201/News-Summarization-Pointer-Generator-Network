Thousands of people are being duped into paying fees to copycat websites which appear to belong to government departments (stock picture)

Thousands of people feel they are being duped into paying fees to copycat websites which appear to belong to government departments such as the Passport Office, the DVLA and the taxman.

Private companies are using web names that link to sites which appear to be an official government service.

They are paying internet search engines, such as Google, to ensure they appear on the first page when consumers carry out searches. It is the domain names of the websites - TaxReturnGateway.com, for example, as opposed to the official Gateway.gov.uk - that suggest they might be official.

However, these firms then charge people huge fees to fill out forms which they could download and fill in themselves for free.

Just
 last week, an elderly couple from Lincoln complained after three £69 
charges - £207 – were taken out of their bank account by what they 
thought was the HM Passport Office.

In fact, it was a private firm that simply filled in a passport application form with information they supplied online.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has upheld complaints against a number of websites which have misled consumers.

However, it has no power to block, fine or take legal action against the culprits. The sites themselves are not acting illegally.

The
 issue came to a head recently following concerns about the 
TaxReturnGateway.com website, which many people have been fooled into 
believing is part of HMRC.

People filling in tax return forms on the site have been told they must pay charges, often running to more than £500, to allow the tax return to be formally accepted.

In reality, these sums relate to a fee being charged by the company involved , which is called Who4 Ltd, rather than any tax payment.

A Who4 spokesman has said: 'It is made absolutely clear on our client's website, specifically the home page, that it is not associated with HMRC, DWP or another government body and further, that it will levy a charge for the service it provides.'

These problems represent just the tip of the iceberg. Other websites relating to passport renewal, driving licence renewal, the supply of the European health card (Ehic), US visas and London’s Congestion charge are also under suspicion.

Chief executive of the Citizens Advice Bureau, Gillian Guy, said: ‘These businesses are nothing more than opportunistic rip-offs and serve little or no purpose for consumers.  They are cashing-in on everything from tax returns to passport applications, and land registry to congestion charges.

‘People who use these websites feel utterly duped after they realise they have paid for something they can do for free elsewhere or have forked out extra costs on top of standard charges.  As households across the country continue to feel a squeeze on their finances they can’t afford to be paying over the odds for services.

‘These firms need to be upfront with people about the service they offer, including the costs they charge and be clear they are not the official website.’

She said Government departments should do more to help consumers find their official websites, while search engines such as Google also have a responsibility to ensure people are not misled.

‘The internet offers endless opportunities to make day to day tasks much easier but consumers can come across difficulties.  Search engines should be striving to ensure customers can make informed choices about the websites they use,’ she said.

The ASA said it is doing all it can to tackle the problem, but it admitted its powers are limited.

A spokesman said: ‘We have been taking action against ads for, and claims appearing on, ‘copycat’ websites.

‘We have been working to secure amendments to the individual sites and ads we’ve received complaints about.  Where needed that can involve working directly with the search engine providers to remove or amend problematic search engine ads.’

However, the organisation admitted: ‘There is no direct action which the ASA can take to prevent these websites from operating all together.

‘The legitimacy of this kind of business practice, while questionable to many, is a matter for Government and Trading Standards to tackle.’

He said the ASA has commissioned some consumer research to understand the extent of the problem, before deciding on future enforcement action.

A Government Cabinet Office spokesman said the Government does takes the issue ‘very seriously’ and has set up a task force to tackle the problem.

He said: ‘We have commissioned a cross-government group to evaluate the problem posed by misleading websites to our customers and the best way to address the issue. As part of this, we are engaging with internet search engine providers to mitigate the risks posed.

‘We’ve streamlined the myriad of government websites into a single domain, GOV.UK, which is built around the needs of users and provides one secure place where most government services can be accessed.’

An elderly couple were charged hundreds of pounds by a private company to fill in their passport forms

A couple in their seventies thought the website ‘passport-uk.co.uk’ was a simple and quick way to renew their passports.

It
 was only later that they realised that the firm was simply a private 
business that filled in an application form – something they could have 
done themselves - rather than part of HM Passport Office.

The couple,
 from Lincoln, are so embarrassed about being taken in that they do not 
want to give their names. However, they are among a large and growing 
group of educated people who have been misled.

Mr K said: ‘I did an 
internet search and this website came up on the first page. It looked 
perfectly genuine and I thought I was dealing with the passport office.

‘I filled out all the details, once for myself and then again for my wife. I could see the fee was £69 for each of us.

‘It
 was only later that I discovered I was not dealing with the passport 
office at all and this fee was for just filling in the form.’

In fact
 the correct basic fee for renewing a passport through the post is 
£72.50, which would have had to be paid on top of the £69 service charge
 applied by the website.

People can renew their passport themselves 
by simply filling in the form on the official website, which can be 
found using the www.gov.uk portal.

Mr K said he subsequently 
discovered that the company had taken the £69 fee out of his bank 
account three times, rather than twice.

‘I trusted the website and 
believed it was official. In my opinion they are clearly trying to fool 
people. I think it is very wrong,’ he said.

The website is owned by 
IQ Channels, which insists there is clear information to show users it 
is not an official passport office portal. The first page of the website
 carries a disclaimer stating: ‘We are not affiliated with Post Office, 
HMPO or any government body.’

A spokesman said all three charges have now been refunded.
