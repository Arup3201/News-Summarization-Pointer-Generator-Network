A model who was a guest at former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's infamous bunga bunga parties today told a court she knew of incriminating sexual photographs showing him with a teenage belly dancer.

Imane Fadil, 26, described how she had heard that the pictures showed twice-married Berlusconi, 74, with his head resting on the stomach of then 17-year-old belly dancer Karima El Mahroug.

He is accused of paying the teenager for sex, as well as dozens of other women, who were guests at the debauched parties he hosted where guests dressed as nuns and police officers before performing pole dances.

Miss Fadil confirmed to the court in Milan rumours that have been circulating in Italy for months that incriminating pictures of a sexual nature showing Berlusconi and Miss El Mahroug exist.She said that 'a friend of a friend' named Gigi told her at a party last month that his girlfriend Michelle Conceicao had pictures of Ruby and the billionaire media tycoon who resigned from office last November.

Miss Fadil added:' 'He said that he had seen them.

'He told me they were of a sexual nature and several of them showed Berlusconi with his head on Ruby's stomach.'

Other rumours circulating in Italy are that pictures also exist of Berlusconi kissing female guests at the party full on the month.

Brazilian model Miss Conceicao, said in an interview last month with an Italian magazine that Berlusconi had paid Miss El Mahroug, also known as Ruby the Heart Stealer, 5,000 euros to sleep with her 'because she was so young'.

Berlusconi’s lawyers, Piero Longo and Niccolo Ghedini, have previously ridiculed Miss Conceicao's account, saying it was 'completely baseless' and contradicted by Miss El Mahroug's statements and by what Conceicao has already told authorities in Milan.

Miss Fadil also said that she had seen photographs of Miss El Mahroug sprawled 'naked as mother nature had intended' on Berlusconi's desk in the office of his home at Arcore near Milan, which was the venue for the parties and that he had asked her as recently as last month not to tell the truth when she testifies.

Miss Fadil told the court how another Brazilian model Iris Berardi stripped down to a thong and fondled herself while wearing an AC Milan jersey and a Ronaldinho mask.

This hearing in Milan involves regional councillor Nicole Minetti, TV news anchor Emilio Fede and showbusiness agent Lele Mora, who are accused of procuring the girls for Berlusconi's parties.

Berlusconi himself is accused of paying to sleep with Miss El Mahroug - in Italy the age of consent is 14 but paying a woman below that age is seen as under age prostitution and it carries a maximum three-year jail term.

Prosecutors say Berlusconi had sex with 33 prostitutes at his villa over the course of several evenings but he has stressed that the parties were merely 'convivial evenings' and that nothing untoward happened - a sentiment echoed by Miss El Mahroug.

Berlusconi is said to have touched and fondled the women as well as having a statue on display which they were encouraged to perform a sex act on.

When details of the allegations emerged he joked 'three women in two months is too many evenfor someone who likes pretty girls, like me,' adding that once again he was the victim of left-wing biased prosecutors out to get him.

In the same trial, Berlusconi is also accused of abuse of office, with prosecutors claiming he had Miss El Mahroug freed from police custody when she was arrested for theft in May 2010 by wrongly telling officers she was related to the then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak.

The Ruby trial, which opened 14 months ago and resumes on Monday, is expected to run for years, with dozens of witnesses called by the prosecution and defence including George Clooney and soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo.
