Claims that almost one  million people have had to resort to emergency supplies from food banks in the past year were dismissed as ‘misleading and emotionally manipulative’ yesterday.

The row came after the Trussell Trust, a charity that runs more than 400 of Britain’s food banks, said rising numbers were turning to the charity because their incomes have been ‘squeezed’.

It claimed more than 913,000 people received three days’ emergency food in the past year – almost a threefold rise on the previous 12 months – with over half blaming changes or delays to their benefit payments.

The Trussell Trust who runs more than 400 food banks was accused  of 'misleading the public' on the issue of food poverty

A letter signed by 36 Anglican bishops and more than 600 church leaders from all major dominations also called for urgent action from ministers to tackle food poverty.

But senior figures in the Government yesterday accused the Trust of ‘publicity seeking’ to benefit its own ‘business’, pointing out that the growing number of food banks inevitably leads to people seeking out free food if it is available.

The Department for Work and Pensions added that a recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development actually found that food poverty has gone down under this government.

The proportion of those in the UK who said they are finding it difficult to afford food dropped from 9.8 per cent in 2007 to 8.1 per cent in 2012.

One senior Whitehall source described the food bank issue as 'fairly misleading and emotionally manipulative publicity seeking'

But the Trussell Trust’s chairman, Chris Mould, said: ‘In the last year we’ve seen things get worse, rather than better, for many people on low incomes.  It’s been extremely tough for a lot of people, with parents not eating properly in order to feed their children and more people than ever experiencing seemingly unfair and harsh benefits sanctions.’

In a highly political intervention, he also called for the Government to drop sanctions against benefit claimants and increase the minimum wage.

But a senior Whitehall source accused Mr Mould of ‘fairly misleading and emotionally manipulative publicity seeking’.

The source added: ‘It’s not entirely surprising given Chris Mould is effectively running a business.’

Another official said: ‘The Trussell Trust have a stated aim to have a food bank in every town in the country, suggesting that they view food banks as a positive feature of a “big society”.

‘It’s slightly confusing to hear them condemning increased use at the same time as aggressively marketing their services.’

The Department of Work and Pensions said fewer people were struggling with their food bills according to a recent OECD report

Tory MP Nigel Mills, a member of the work and pensions select committee, criticised the Trust’s views on benefits.

‘For those in genuine need, the benefits system gives people a decent level of help,’ he said. ‘I don’t think any of my constituents are clamouring for us to increase benefits.

‘There are nothing like a million people in this country who can’t afford to put a meal on the table.’

A DWP spokesman said: ‘Even the OECD says there are fewer people struggling with their food bills compared with a few years ago, benefit processing times are improving and the Trussell Trust’s own research recognises the effect their marketing activity has on the growth of their business.’
