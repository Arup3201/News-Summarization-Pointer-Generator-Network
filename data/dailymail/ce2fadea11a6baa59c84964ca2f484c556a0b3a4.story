Greek police fired water cannons and fought running battles with protesters hurling petrol bombs outside its parliament today, during the biggest rally in over a year against spending cuts the country must approve to avert bankruptcy.

Nearly 100,000 Greeks waving flags and chanting 'Fight! They're drinking our blood' packed the square outside parliament as lawmakers neared a vote on unpopular budget cuts and labour reforms that the government is narrowly expected to win.

Violence erupted when a handful of protesters tried to break through a barricade to enter parliament, prompting riot police to respond with teargas, stun grenades and - for the first time in an anti-austerity protest - water cannons.

More chaos reigned inside the assembly, where the session was briefly interrupted when parliamentary workers went on strike to protest against a clause that would have cut their salaries.

In a humiliating about-face, the government was forced to cancel the measure to allow the session to resume.

'Today we vote on whether we will remain in the euro zone or return to international isolation, meet complete bankruptcy and end up in the drachma,' Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said in a final plea to lawmakers to back the cuts and unlock aid.

Outside, loud booms rang out through the evening as hooded protesters hurled molotov cocktails and rocks at police. Billowing smoke and small fires dotted the square and streets next to parliament.

At least 35 people were detained. There were no reports of serious injuries but at least four protesters suffered breathing problems, police said, as protesters dispersed in pouring rain.

Challenge: The vote on the deeply unpopular austerity measures represents the toughest challenge yet for Greece's fragile coalition government

The 13.5 billion euro package is expected to scrape through parliament despite its unpopularity

The anti-austerity rally appeared to be the largest in Athens since summer last year.

'These measures are killing us little by little and lawmakers in there don't give a damn,' said Maria Aliferopoulou, a 52-year-old mother of two living on 1,000 euros a month.

'They are rich, they have everything and we have nothing and are fighting for crumbs, for survival.'

The vote on the painful austerity measures necessary to keep the country afloat represents the sternest test yet for Greece's fragile coalition government.

The 13.5billion euro (£10.8billion) package is expected to scrape through parliament, following a day-long debate.

But any defections or abstentions could severely weaken the conservative-led coalition formed in June.

Greek lawmakers were locked in a fierce debate today ahead of a vote on a new austerity package needed to unlock international aid and stave off imminent bankruptcy. Outside, crowds gathered to protest against the measures

The Greek parliament has to approve the package of spending cuts and tax increases agreed with the country's international creditors so that it can continue receiving vital bailout loans.

The next loan installment of 31.5billion euro (£25.3billion) out of a total of 240billion euro (£192billion) is already overdue and without it, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras has said Greece will run out of euros on November 16.

If the country cannot raise any more funds from elsewhere, it would quickly find it impossible to pay its debts. The government would then be forced into issuing its old currency, the drachma, to pay bills and wages.

As well as pushing the country out of the 17-country group that uses the euro, this could trigger a nightmare of bank runs, hyperinflation and currency depreciation that would vapourise savings and put even the most basic goods out of the reach of many Greeks.

If the country was forced into a default and began printing its own currency, the entire eurozone's finances would become increasingly shaky as markets would assume other countries in the eurozone might be the next to go.

Investors would begin to pull their money out of the region or demand higher returns to keep it there.

The package is expected to scrape through Parliament, following a hasty one-day debate

'We must vote in favour of the measures,' conservative New Democracy lawmaker Constantinos Tassoulas urged Parliament at the start of the stormy debate. 'It is our duty.'

The measures being debated include new deep pension cuts and tax hikes, a two-year increase in the retirement age to 67, and laws that will make it easier to fire and transfer civil servants.

The country is suffering a deep recession set to enter a sixth year, and record high unemployment of 25 per cent.

Opposition parties accused the 
government of trampling on Greece's constitution with the proposed cuts 
in pensions and benefits, and complained that the several hundred 
pages-long bill was too complex to be debated in a single session.

'This is blackmail,' main opposition Radical Left Coalition MP Zoi Constantopoulou said.

Mr
Samaras' small Democratic Left coalition partner has said it will not 
back the measures, while a handful of lawmakers from the third coalition
party, the Socialists, are expected to vote against the austerity 
package.

The government combined has 176 of Parliament's 300 seats, and needs a simple majority of those present to pass the bill. Without the Democratic Left, Mr Samaras' conservatives and the Socialists control 160 votes. However there is still a threat of more dissenters.

While Mr Samaras has been facing increasing pressure at home, the other members of the 17-country eurozone have been doing what they can to ensure Greece stays in the currency group.

Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, for example, has softened her previous tough stance toward Greece - paving the way for a deal to let Greece take more time to meet loan conditions, including painful budget cuts.

Even if Parliament approves the draft legislation, it is not clear whether Greece will receive the next bailout installment in time for Mr Samaras' November 16 deadline.

The payment was expected to be approved at a meeting of European finance ministers on Monday November 12.

However the ministers' vote hinges on a report by the so-called troika of austerity inspectors from the European Union, IMF and European Central bank - which may not be ready in time. In this case, the EU or ECB may have to step in with some interim financing.

The vote in Athens comes on the second day of a 48-hour general strike which has shut down the public administration, left hospitals functioning on emergency staff and closed schools and tax offices.

All ferry and train schedules have been cancelled until Thursday, flights will be disrupted by a four-hour air traffic controllers' strike and Athens will be without public transport for most of the day.

Two separate anti-austerity demonstrations are expected to converge on Parliament this afternoon, at the height of the debate on the new cutbacks.

On Tuesday, more than 35,000 people marched through central Athens to express their anger at the new belt-tightening.
