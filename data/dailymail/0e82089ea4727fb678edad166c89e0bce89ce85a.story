This is the first glimpse of £170,000-a-week footballer John Terry’s lavish new £10million home - built in his old back garden.

The Chelsea star was given permission to demolish the house he had built for his mother-in-law Sue Poole, beside the house he shared with his wife Toni, and replace it with the nine-bedroom mansion.

The 32-year-old defender’s new sprawling home was pictured today from the A3 in Oxshott, Surrey.

The development, which would look more
at home in Beverley Hills than the Surrey hills, was clearly nearing 
completion, after builders started work in December 2011.

As
well as its nine bedrooms, the stunning white building, which is a 
short drive from the Chelsea training ground in nearby Cobham, boasts an
impressive eight bathrooms and eight dressing rooms.

A
33x40ft indoor swimming pool was also believed to have been built on 
the site, complete with a jacuzzi, steam room and changing facilities.

Architects’
plans for the home had also revealed that should father-of-two Terry 
need some time on his own after a game, he could chill out in one of the
ground floor’s 19 rooms.

Or he could relax in front of a DVD with his seven-year-old twins Georgie John and Summer Rose in the cinema room or the snug.

Staff were also due to be catered for 
in an accommodation wing and should the Terrys have people to visit, 
they could sleep over in an annexe in the opposite wing.

Parking
should not be an issue, with seven spaces put aside in plans, as well 
as a disabled space outside the grey-roofed home, which also features 
various gables and romantic archways.

In
April last year keen angler Terry was given permission to build a 
fishing lake next to his new home - despite it being on green belt land.
Then in December he was allowed to move a 28x16ft water feature.

Former
England captain Terry, who was born in 1980 in Barking, east London, 
has made 383 career appearances for Chelsea and won three Premier League
titles. He married his wife Toni in 2007.

It was claimed in January 2012 that 
Terry remortgaged his old mansion for a fourth time, taking his home 
loan to a staggering £4.65million - more than twice the amount he paid 
for the house.

He bought the home for £2.25million in 2003 and carried out the most recent remortgage in 2011.

Terry remortgaged with Northern Rock 12 
months after first buying the house. Then he did so with Queen’s banker 
Coutts - through whom he bought the house - in March 2006 and yet again 
in 2009.

It was also claimed that Terry 
remortgaged Mrs Poole’s home in a move apparently to generate cash to 
build the new vast luxury estate from scratch.

He bought Mrs Poole her mansion next 
door to his own for a reported £3.15million in August 2007, but 
remortgaged on June 7 2011 - the same day he remortgaged his own place 
for the fourth time.

Months earlier he had won planning permission to turn the site into the super mansion.

Terry has had a controversial career, and was last year banned for four matches and fined £220,000 after being found guilty of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers player Anton Ferdinand by the FA.

The case also went to court last July, but Terry was cleared of a racially aggravated public order offence against Ferdinand at Westminister Magistrates’ Court.
