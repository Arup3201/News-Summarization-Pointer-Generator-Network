Ross Pearson is ready to put the worst performance of his UFC career behind him when he takes on Sam Stout at UFC 185 in Dallas on March 14.

Pearson suffered a shock defeat to Al Iaquinta in Sydney to put a dent in his hopes of working towards a lightweight title shot.

But he is confident he has corrected the problems and is ready to shine against Stout.

‘It was an up and down year,’ Pearson told Sportsmail. ‘I had my best performance in the UFC and then my worst, back to back.

‘As soon as I walked out of the Octagon, I knew what was wrong.

‘I wasn't mentally up for it and I was disappointed in myself.

‘I made mistakes in training camp but I will learn from them, I had to swallow a bitter pill.

‘I know I am up there with the best and I’m ready to make a statement.’

Pearson fought three times last year, including a win over Gray Maynard, but he admitted he had to make changes to his regime.

Pearson admitted his defeat in Australia was the worst performance of his UFC career 

He added: ‘I've been to see a sports psychologist. I always thought I’d just get up for a fight but as you get up the ladder there’s a lot to think about.

‘I got married and there were a lot of things going on outside the Octagon. I was a little bit worn out but I don’t want to make excuses.’

Pearson, who will fly out to his San Diego training at the end of the month, has long had his sights on Stout.

‘I've always wanted to fight Sam Stout,’ he said. ‘We've fought on the same cards and I like his style of fighting.

‘He comes forward and takes risks and he doesn't back down.’
