A pensioner who stored his entire life savings in a drawer at home has lost everything after being burgled.

Phil Newton, 81, has been putting money into the drawer at his home in Burnage for over 70 years, starting with a single shilling when he was seven.

But the tens of thousands of pounds Mr Newton amassed were taken from him when three men broke into his house last week.

Phil Newton, 81, had his entire life savings stolen when three men broke into his home in Burnage and stole tens of thousands of pounds from a drawer in home

The former RAF pilot avoided putting the money in a bank account for fear it would affect the amount of pension he received.

Instead, he regularly put envelopes filled with £5 and £10 notes into the drawer in his house.

'I've been saving since I was seven. Over the years I would just put aside what I didn't need to live on,' he said.

'Sometimes I would use the money to buy non-essential things like a new suit or when I got my CD player, but I wasn't saving for something specific like a house.

'On the day of the burglary I came 
home from the shops on my bike, and when I tried to open the front door 
the chain was on from the inside.

'It was then I got a feeling something wasn't right so I went round the back and the back door was open.

Detectives believe the burglars could have been watching Mr Newton's house until he went out.

'As I walked to the stairs three men ran down shouting "we're the police" and ran off down the road.

'I saw the bag in one man's hand but didn't think anything of it at the time.

Mr Newton had been saving money since he was seven years-old, starting with a single shilling in 1938

'I only realised they had the money when I went upstairs. It's awful that it's gone.

'I'm not a harsh person but if they are caught I'd like to see them birched. But there's no use for moaning or for tears over these things.'

Police are appealing for anyone who may have seen the men running down Kingsway at 11am on Monday 19 August to contact them. 

One of the thieves is described as white, 6ft and wearing blue jeans. The other two were also white and around 6ft 5ins.

Detectives wish to hear from anyone who notices someone suddenly spending or trying to change large amounts of cash, particularly £5 or £10 notes.

Sgt Richard Thompson, from West Didsbury police station, said: 'We want to strike a chord with the community and appeal to them to help us find these offenders. 

'This man, vulnerable because of his age, has been targeted and lost his life savings.

'If anyone sees someone they know going on spending sprees that they wouldn’t have been able to afford before, or with large amounts of cash, we would like to hear from them.'

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
