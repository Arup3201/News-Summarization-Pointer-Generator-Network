Prosecutors attempting to convict a man for allegedly killing his wife during a scuba diving trip on their honeymoon clashed with the judge presiding over the case today.

Judge Tommy Nail barred testimony from two witnesses as he questioned defendant Gabe Watson's alleged motive in open court.

Watson is accused of turning off Tina Watson's air supply and attempting to cash in on her death by selling her possessions and collecting on a $130,000 insurance policy after she drowned in Australia in 2003.

He is facing a life sentence without parole.

As ABC News reports, Don Valeska called funeral home director Sam Shelton to testify in the Alabama court of how Gabe Watson retrieved his wife's engagement ring from the casket, when Nail interrupted the testimony.

'I took my grandmother's engagement ring when she was buried. I think it's quite common,' he said, asking the witness if that was in fact true.

Shelton said the practice was 'quite common'. He noted Gabe Watson asked his wife's wedding ring be left on.

Nail ordered the jury out of the courtoom and proceeded to question Valeska's argument.

'You mean to tell me that [Gabe 
Watson] bought the engagement ring, married her, he and his family paid 
for a wedding, he planned and paid for a honeymoon halfway around the 
world, all so he could kill her to get an engagement ring he bought in 
the first place?' the judge asked.

Judge
 Nail also barred testimony from from Alanda Thomas that the defendant 
said he and his wife discussed her funeral preferences on the flight to 
Australia, calling it hearsay.

Today's testimony followed an emotional day in court on Tuesday as Tina Watson's sister, Amanda Phillips, Mrs Watson's maid-of-honour, took the stand.

Ms Phillips recounted a bizarre remark Gabe Watson made when he viewed his bride in her coffin, allegedly saying: 'At least her breasts are perky', as the pair paid their last respects at the wake. .

Following the funeral, Ms Phillips said 
her suspicions were aroused by Watson's actions.

At his home after the 
service, he reportedly showed pictures of his late wife next to a sign which read 
'Caution: Drowning'.

Ms Phillips said her best friend had broken up with Gabe Watson in the months before their wedding
 after she fell for another man. However she later returned 
to Watson, reported the Courier-Mail.

Ms Phillips said initially she had been convinced that her friend's death in the Great Barrier Reef, 11 days after she 
married, was a tragic accident. 

The defence contends Mrs Watson's death was an accidental drowning.

Gabe Watson served 18 months in prison in 
Australia after pleading guilty to a manslaughter charge in his wife's 
death but that charge involved negligence, not an intentional killing.

The accused's allegedly odd remarks about his dead wife came to light as another witness testified today that the diving firm violated its own rules in
 preparing the woman for the fatal trip in 2003.

Wade Singleton, who was dive master on the 
trip, said 26-year-old Tina didn't get a 
private briefing or an orientation dive before going into the water with
 her husband - despite policies that require both.

Mr Singleton admitted that he and 
other crew members didn't ask a number of questions of Mrs Watson - a 
novice with only 11 previous dives.

Government
 regulations in Australia required professional diving teams to make 
in-depth, individual assessments of divers' skills.

However employees on the boat, the Spoilsport, didn't perform all the checks on Tina Watson or other divers, Mr Singleton said.

Defense lawyer Brett Bloomston asked: 'Were you not aware that she had never been in the ocean in an open water dive?'

Mr Singleton, who now works as a paramedic, said: 'No, I was not.'

The
 former dive master said Mrs Watson's new husband Gabe was considered an
 experienced diver because he had 55 previous dives, including more than
 a dozen in the ocean.

Both he and his wife declined an orientation dive on the Great Barrier Reef site with an expert.

The prosecution asked Mr Singleton: 'You can't make them take the dive if they don't want to take the dive?'

I said she looked pretty in her dress. Gabe said, 'At least her breasts are perky.'

Amanda Phillips' exchange with Gabe Watson at his wife's funeral

He responded: 'No, I can't.'

The
 jury of eight women and six men have previously looked at a haunting 
underwater photo taken by another diver of the death scene.

It
 showed Tina sprawled in deep water as Watson swam to the surface. 
Prosecutors appeared to attempt to cast doubt on Watson's version of 
what happened.

They believe 
Watson turned off his wife's air supply while both were underwater and 
held her in a bear-hug until she lost consciousness - before turning the
 air back on and letting her sink.

Tina Watson's father, Tommy Thomas, left the courtroom in tears today as an Australian medical examiner showed jurors autopsy photos. 

Dr David John Williams said an examination determined the woman drowned and he ruled out other factors including a heart problem that she'd had several years earlier.

Prosecutors contend Watson killed his wife in hopes of collecting $210,000 in insurance benefits.

Caesar Lamonica, a manager at the store where Tina Watson worked, testified that Watson came in less than a month after her death asking about a life insurance policy.

The defense has argued that Watson did not stand to make financial gain because Tina Watson's father was the beneficiary of her life insurance policy and a travel insurance policy only covered expenses.

The trial continues.
