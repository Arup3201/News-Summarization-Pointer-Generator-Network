It has been dubbed the most luxurious cruise ship ever built and at a cost of $450million (£297million) it is certainly costing enough to build.

The Regent Seven Seas Cruises Explorer will come in at 732ft in length, but will carry just 750 guests in total and every room will be a suite.

With gourmet dining throughout, marble floors, crystal chandeliers and one 'residence' that is almost four times bigger than the average house in the UK, the vessel is certainly set to take the luxury ship market by storm.

The Penthouse on the Seven Seas Explorer will offer luxury and importantly decent amount of space for guests to relax

There are already two dining rooms built on board the Seven Seas Explorer, with plans for more to be constructed before first sail

The Seven Seas Explorer is still under construction, but already the plans for rendering are spectacular 

At 56,000 gross-registered tons (around 51,000 tonnes), the all-suite, all-balcony ship will boast one-of-the-highest space ratios in the cruise industry and an exceptionally high staff-to-guest ratio.

The ship is designed to be the most luxurious ship ever built, with the one-of-a-kind, opulent 3,875-square-foot Regent Suite, extravagantly designed lounges and showplaces, and lavish gourmet restaurants. 

The average size of a house in the UK is around 1,042-square-feet, so the top suite is almost four times the size of this. 

'We meticulously designed every detail aboard Seven Seas Explorer in order to make it the most luxurious ship ever built, and we are thrilled by the overwhelmingly positive response from our past guests and travel partners,' said Graham Sadler, managing director of Regent Seven Seas Cruises UK.

The living area inside the Regent Suite, that measures in total almost four times the size of an average UK house, oozes class and style

'Our booking experience echoed that of our offices in the US and with the maiden voyage nearly sold out and demand for the inaugural season being extremely strong, it underscores the global excitement surrounding the world's most luxurious ship.'

The world's most luxurious ship is already surpassing expectations, as Regent Seven Seas Cruises reported both single-day and first week record bookings for the line's new flagship Seven Seas Explorer.

The ship went on sale exclusively to members of the line's loyalty programme, the Seven Seas Society, on January 19, and reservations made that day surpassed the line's previous single-day revenue record by nearly three times.

The welcome on board the luxury cruise ship is sure to leave guests wide-eyed with anticipation of what to expect next

The lounge on the Explorer can suit any mood; you can quite easily relax with a nice cocktail on an evening, or have a morning pick-me-up

The Observation Lounge abroad the Explorer is sure to be a favourite haunt, catching glimpses of sunsets and sunrise

The new level of grandeur offered on Seven Seas Explorer generated strong demand for the ship's inaugural season, resulting in a new weekly sales record for Regent Seven Seas Cruises that more than doubled the previous high. 

Currently, reservations for Seven Seas Explorer are limited to past cruisers with the line and will become widely available from  February 4.

Scheduled to set sail in the summer of 2016, Seven Seas Explorer's maiden voyage will be a 14-night sailing from Monte Carlo to Venice on 20 July 2016. The inaugural season highlights a variety of iconic locations throughout the Mediterranean including Ibiza, Barcelona, St. Tropez and Venice.

Regent Seven Seas Cruises is setting a new standard for luxury cruise holidays with the launch of Seven Seas Explorer.
