Junk food companies are getting around a ban on children’s TV advertising by interacting with them on Facebook, an investigation has revealed.

Channel 4’s Dispatches found manufacturers of sweets and sugary breakfast cereals were talking to children on social media.

Undercover reporters posing as an 11-year-old were wished ‘happy birthday’ by the sweet brands Chewits and Swizzels Matlow, which then went on to promote their products.

The companies are exploiting a loophole in the law which bans advertising unhealthy food to children on the television – but not on the internet.

Marketing: This is a screen grab from an 'advergame' created by Coca-Cola and apparently aimed at children

Academic research has shown that young children are especially vulnerable to it as they do not have the critical faculty to recognise they are being advertised to.

Some brands, including Oreo, Cadbury's and Coca-Cola, are also advertising their wares via games available for children as young as four which are free to download online.

Experts said the disturbing new trend would contribute to the country’s obesity crisis and called for the Government to step in.

Dr Julian Hamilton Shield, a specialist in diabetes at Bristol University, said: ‘If your product happens to be not particularly good for you and you’re pushing it and it’s got a child friendly message, then surely you’re trying to encourage children to eat poor food.

‘The state needs to have some control over this. It will bankrupt the country eventually, as we won’t be able to afford all the health consequences.’

Gerard Hastings, social marketing professor at the University of Stirling, added: ‘This is about subterfuge to get into the kids’ lives to get into the family life and thereby access to the parent’s pockets.

‘You’ve got a product that might sell, all they’re concerned with is selling it.’

Promotion: The game features a McDonald's restaurant despite the ban on advertising junk food to children

Advertising unhealthy food during children’s television programmes was banned by Ofcom in 2007 in a bid to curb childhood obesity.

The measure followed Food Standards Agency research which found a direct link between overweight children and the impact of TV advertising.

However, the ban does not cover the internet, meaning many brands have simply switched to targeting youngsters while they play on their computer, tablet or smartphone.

Facebook rules stipulate that you must be at least 13 years old to have a profile, but many children lie about their age.

The Dispatches undercover team created a profile using the birthday of a 16 year-old, but posted messages online saying they were 11 years old.

They identified six brands which they found to be interacting with children on Facebook, and posted messages on their walls about an up-coming 11th birthday.

Some of the brands responded by commenting on the post.

Chewits wrote back: ‘Happy Birthday for Saturday! Well, we now have chewmix bags which have a random mix of core and Xtreme flavours in them and later this month we will be announcing a very exciting new product so keep your eyes peeled. KEEP CHEWING!’

Swizzels Matlow sent a smiley face and promoted its 'Squashie' gum sweets by writing: 'Did you manage to get those squashies for your party?'

Brands including Chewits wished children 'happy birthday' on social 
media sites, before pushing their products

Kellogg's Krave, a sugary cereal laced
 with chocolate, also indicated that they ‘liked’ one of the child’s 
messages posted on Facebook.

Many
 brands are now also producing ‘advergames’ for children which they can 
download onto their computer or smartphone from an online App Store.

Programme
 researchers found games by Coca Cola, Oreo and Cadbury's that were made
 available with a 4+ age on the parental control rating.

All three of these brands have previously pledged not to advertise sugary and fattening products to anyone under the age of 12.

In
 one example highlighted by the programme, Coca-Cola has produced a game
 in collaboration with McDonald's called Crabs and Penguins.

It features a McDonald's restaurant as part of the scenery, and the game involves getting a crab to collect cola bottle tops.

Chewits also has a game featuring a Chewitsaurus, while Swizzles Matlow also have one themed around their sweets, Squashies.

Dr
 Jennifer Harris, marketing expert at Yale University, told the 
programme: ‘The way that companies market to children online is really 
very sneaky. Advertising really is most effective when people don’t 
think of it as advertising, when they’re thinking of the game they’re 
playing.'

Ian Barber of 
the Advertising Association added: ‘It’s absolutely the case that 
advergames are less easily identifiable as an advert than something that
 interrupts the programme you’ve just been watching for the last half an
 hour. The fundamental point is, is it appropriate?’

When approached for comment, all the companies mentioned said they do not target children with advertising.

A
 Kellogg’s spokesman said: ‘As soon as we noticed the age we unliked it,
 reported the post to Facebook, and sent a note to the girl and her 
parents.

‘The post 
mentions that it was her eleventh birthday and we accept that this is 
something that should have been identified earlier.’

Coca-Cola,
 Oreo and Cadbury’s all said their games were aimed at over 12s, with 
the latter two saying the 4+ rating had been imposed by the App Store.

As a result of the investigation, both Kellogg’s and Chewits have said they will review their social media policies.
