The decision to slash more than 1,400 jobs at Britain’s last train-maker after the Government’s award of a major contract to Germany was met with uproar yesterday.

The axing of posts at Bombardier in Derby sparked a renewed ‘British jobs for British workers’ row as ministers conceded more needed to be done to create ‘a level playing field’ with EU rivals.

Unions condemned the move as ‘the ultimate stupidity’, ‘a scandal’ and ‘a tragedy’ at odds with the Government’s pledge to make ‘made in Britain and created in Britain’ its watchword.

Devastated: Bombardier staff arrive at work this morning where they were told the firm was shedding 1,400 jobs. The decision comes after the Government's decision to award a lucrative carriage contract to Siemens of Germany

Local MP Chris Williamson said the decision was the equivalent of reading the last rites to the British rail industry.

Labour business spokesman John Denham called it a ‘body blow’ for British manufacturing.

But Transport Secretary Philip 
Hammond blamed Labour for the decision to award the order, part of the 
£6billion Thameslink project in London, to Siemens of Germany.

He 
claimed the way in which the last Government had drawn up the 
procurement contracts to comply with EU trade rules had put British 
interests at a disadvantage.

He noted that ‘French governments 
routinely award contracts for trains to French builders and the Germans 
award contracts for trains to German builders’.

Mr Hammond and Business Secretary 
Vince Cable have written to the Prime Minister urging a change in the 
way contracts are awarded to give UK manufacturers ‘a level playing 
field’.

Under EU rules, the British Government cannot discriminate 
against bidding companies from other member states.

But in their joint letter, Mr Hammond
and Mr Cable say other EU countries ‘appear to manage their public 
procurement processes with a sharper focus on domestic supply chains 
than we have hitherto’.

Blame game: Bombardier in Derby say the 1,400 job cuts are directly as a result of the Government's decision, a claim denied by ministers

It says the UK must, in future, play 
the same game as our EU rivals, helping our domestic companies as far as
possible while still staying within the rules.

The Siemens bid was chosen because it
gave ‘best value for money to the taxpayer’. The Government said it 
would create up to 2,000 UK jobs at the Siemens factory in Hebburn, Tyne
and Wear, and two planned maintenance depots.

Bob Crow, general secretary of the 
RMT transport union, accused the Government of ‘colluding with the EU in
a policy of industrial vandalism that would wipe out train building in 
the nation that gave railways to the world’.

Transport Secretary Philip Hammond (right) says the job cuts are not 
fully the result of the decision to hand the contract to Siemans

Just four months ago, David Cameron dragged the whole Cabinet to Derby, centre of British engineering excellence, to extol the virtues of rebalancing the economy away from finance towards high quality manufacturing.

Today, the Prime Minister has to confront the hugely embarrassing fact that one of Derby’s key businesses, train-maker Bombardier Transportation, is preparing for its demise in Britain because Cameron’s Government has awarded the biggest new contract to make rolling stock in years to German rival Siemens.

It really beggars belief that Bombardier could have lost out to the Germans for the £1.4billion Thameslink contract to build 1,200 carriages for the route between Bedford and Brighton.

Yet the behaviour of the Government in this travesty, which will lead to the loss of 1,400 skilled jobs in Derby, has been utterly pusillanimous.

Transport Secretary Philip Hammond, portrayed before the 2010 election as a likely future star of a Tory government, suggests lamely that the decision is the fault of the Labour government.

Business Secretary Vince Cable, the minister who has placed himself at the heart of the ‘growth agenda’, has responded by setting up what he terms an ‘Economic Response Task Force’.

No one should kid themselves this means the Coalition is going to try to save the jobs or to reverse the ‘preferred bidder’ status given to Siemens – indeed, Philip Hammond has said this is not possible. All it means is that a group of quangocrats has been asked to look at ways of ‘mitigating’ the economic impact of the disaster.

Past experience – from, for example, the closure of MG-Rover under Labour in 2005 – suggests that resources are made available to help those made redundant find jobs, but after the initial furore dies down the assistance vanishes into the mists.

The real tragedy of the Thameslink decision is that it would never have happened if Britain had put the national and public interest first, as our Continental counterparts do.

As a country we remain honourably committed to free and open capital markets. But this has allowed overseas firms not only to pick off our best companies but also to win open tenders for valuable contracts – and often with the help of their own governments.

Our competitors across Europe and the world do not operate on the same basis of free and open trade. Economic patriotism, looking after home-based industry and making sure it is first in line for important national contracts, is the priority in Paris, Berlin and even Washington.

There is no better example of how Britain has lost control of its own economic destiny than the loss of our train manufacturing capacity.Bombardier would have been delighted to receive the Thameslink contract. But because it is a minor subsidiary of a huge Canadian-based outfit which also makes planes, winning a contract in Britain, on the outer fringe of its empire, would be considered relatively unimportant.

The tragedy is that we in Britain once led the world in train-making.

In the 1990s, GEC-Alstom (part of the late Lord Weinstock’s General Electric Corporation) was one of the most successful train manufacturers on the planet. Operating out of the Midlands, it was a world leader in high-speed locomotives and train systems.

But Weinstock’s successor, Lord Simpson, wasn’t interested in old-style manufacturing and invested in telecoms instead. The company’s half-share in GEC-Alstom was sold to its French partner and, as night follows day, train production went with it.

This left Bombardier as the sole representative in the UK of British train-making skills.

I have no doubt that Bombardier did its best to win the Thameslink contract. But the best for a relatively small, anonymous subsidiary of a Canadian-based company is simply not good enough.

Weinstock was often criticised for being too cautious. But when it came to winning UK government contracts for GEC and preserving engineering and manufacturing jobs in Britain, there was no one better.

He and those who worked alongside him believed big British engineering and manufacturing contracts should always go to UK companies.

As a result, Weinstock developed an extraordinary network of contacts inside government and the civil service to make sure this happened, and he would take his case personally to the Prime Minister of the day. Such hard work and patriotism paid off. He also recruited as his chairman former Tory minister Lord Prior, who became a super salesman for British industry overseas.

Job cuts: Commuters crowd onto a Thameslink service in London, whose new carriages will now be made by a German company, leading to the cutting of 1,400 jobs at British manufacturer Bombardier

Weinstock was, quite simply, the greatest of advocates for Britain and its high-tech and engineering capabilities.

But when great UK companies are sold overseas, leaders like him are lost. However committed they might claim be to the British market, foreign companies ensure their own domestic interests come first.

That is why we should be so disturbed that a series of great companies with the word ‘British’ in their name, including British Oxygen, British Energy, British Steel and Associated British Ports, have ended up in foreign hands.

What really matters when a firm is plundered by an overseas buyer or when a contract is awarded to a foreign competitor, is that it is not just the jobs at the central company, like Bombardier, that are lost but those down the supply chain.

For every coach built by a train-maker there are hundreds of manufacturers making each component part. If you cut the main contract, tens of thousands of more jobs right down the line are sacrificed as well as the skills to do them.

In the case of Bombardier, it is pathetic for the Government to claim that the decision to buy German-made rather than British trains cannot be reversed.

Chancellor George Osborne has declared he wants the words ‘made and created in Britain’ to drive the economy forward. He and his fellow ministers now have the opportunity.

With the right amount of willpower, as the great British industrialists of the past demonstrated, governments and civil servants can be persuaded – and even ordered – to favour home-grown engineering and industry.

Failure by the Government to reverse the Thameslink decision will mean this nation will be doomed to import all of our railway rolling stock forever more, and will signal that we are giving up the ghost on being a world-class manufacturer.
