Beards may have seen a resurgence over recent years, but they have been used as status symbols for millenia.

The discovery of a 4,000-year-old blade in Russia, said to have been used for shaving and trimming, reveals the importance of looking well-presented during the Bronze Age.

Archaeologists explained that the thin bronze plate had been sharpened on both sides and added that it may have even doubled up as a knife.

Vyacheslav Molodin, the deputy head of the Siberian Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography, told The Siberian Times: 'The site was long ago classified as belonging to the developed Bronze era but the bronze object was the first found there. 

'It is a thin bronze plate, sharpened on all sides [and] was a more universally-used tool.'

Mr Molodin found the blade during an expedition to a site of ancient settlement in the Vengerovo region of Novosibirsk.

The oldest razor ever found is believed to date back to 18,000 BC. 

Early implements were made from clam shells, shark teeth and flint sharpened on rocks.

They rose in popularity during the Bronze Age, when they were made of metal and were oval. 

In particular, they are often linked with members of an early Celtic culture called Hallstatt, that spanned Iron and Bronze Ages.

Men used razors as status symbols, and many were personal to their owners. 

Some were elaborately decorated, and often buried with their owners. 

Straight razors were introduced during the 18th  century and became common place in barbers, before double-edge and safety blades were manufactured by King Camp Gillette in the early 1900s.

Following World War I, men had to shave daily so their gas masks would fit, and safety razors become standard issue during the WWII.

They rose in popularity during the Bronze Age, where they were made of metal and curved or oval in shape.

In particular, they were often linked with members of the Hallstatt-culture, which spanned the Iron and Bronze ages. 

It was one of the earliest Celtic cultures and was named after the town Hallstatt in Stiermarken, Austria. 

A number of oval blades with small finger holes have been found across Europe, believing to date back to this period.

They have also been uncovered during excavations in Egypt, while Roman leaders were sometimes depicted with razor-style tools in drawings and manuscripts.

Following World War I, men were required to shave daily so their gas masks would fit, and disposable razors become standard issue during World War II.

The area of Novosibirsk has been a popular site for archaeologists.  

Other bronze items were found during a second archaeological expedition in the Krasnozersky district of the region.

Vladimir Sumin, head of the archaeology department of the Novosibirsk Region Cultural Heritage Centre, added: 'We found a Scythian burial mound, of which there are only a few in the region. 

'There we found bronze bells and parts of a harness from the early Scythian time.'
