Islamic State terrorists last night released another propaganda video featuring British hostage John Cantlie, who warns of an impending third war in the Gulf.

In a video clip posted online, the abducted photojournalist, who describes himself as the 'British citizen abandoned by my government', accuses the western media of being complicit with America and its allies in trying to drum up support for a ground war against ISIS.

He said: 'Obama is terribly busy insisting US ground troops won’t be going back into Iraq. Thus even the Pentagon admits airstrikes are a stop-gap military measure that will not disrupt the Islamic State actvities'

He added: 'Meanwhile, America puts 1,200 troops into Baghdad to protect their embassy and the airport. Surely sounds like boots on ground to me… The rise of the Islamic State give Obama a chance to look tough in the media just as midterm elections approach.'

In tonight’s professionally-produced video, the 43-year-old captive from Surrey – wearing a Guantanamo Bay-style orange jumpsuit – said Obama's use of the plight of the Yazidi minority, which has suffered greatly at the hands of ISIS, as justification of military force is disingenuous.

He said: 'Since when has America cared about the fate of a minority in the Muslim lands?

'Modern history is sadly littered with religious minorities being crushed and neither the U.S.  nor anyone else said anything.'

Mr Cantlie, a photojournalist who was kidnapped in Syria two years ago, also said the public is wrong to support the airstrikes.

Mr Cantlie, a photojournalist who has worked for newspapers including The Sunday Times, has featured in several propaganda videos released by the Islamic extremists in recent weeks

He said: 'They say the public has a short memory, but the ink has not even dried on the written orders to pull out of Afghanistan and here we are, gearing up for Gulf War 3.

'They (IS) have grown exponentially  so that even the U.S. military, the policeman of the world, are not able to contain them. "So we have spent a few trillion dollars on failed wars in Iraq and Afghanistan", is the unwritten message.

'"Isn't it worth spending a few trillion more to avoid the spectre of another 9/11?"' 

In an article published last week in an IS magazine Mr Cantlie claimed he wrote the scripts for the videos, although this could be propaganda put out by the militant group.

'Frustrating': Two days ago Jessica Cantlie urged the Islamic State to 'restart dialogue' with the family

Two days ago Mr Cantlie's sister  urged the terror group to 'restart dialogue' with his family.

In an emotional appeal, Jessica Cantlie said that the family had been in contact with the terrorists, but that recent messages have been ignored.

Ms Cantlie said it was 'frustrating' that their line of communication had been cut off and 'strongly' challenged the group to return to 'their previously opened channel'. 

Referring to her brother's appearance in the videos and article, Ms Cantlie said his 'words are powerful and have huge resonance'. 

Speaking directly to camera, Ms Cantlie said: 'We, John's family, want to address Islamic State, who are holding him. 

'It is not true to say that there has been no attempt to engage with IS. It is simply not accurate.

'This is frustrating for all parties, including those who are trying to assist us. We had previously been in contact through a channel started by you, but then this stopped for reasons best known to you. 

Earlier this month Mr Cantlie's sick father issued a heartbreaking plea from a hospital bed for his son’s release.

In a direct televised appeal to Islamic State, Paul Cantlie, 80, who has throat cancer, asked his jihadist captors to return him home safely to those who love him.

He said his efforts to communicate with the militants had only been met with silence and he could only hope they had received them.

Speaking about watching the original footage of his son, he said: ‘For the first time in almost two years, we saw John when he made a televised broadcast during which he told viewers that he was still a prisoner of the Islamic State and that maybe he will live and maybe he will die.

‘As a family we experienced great relief seeing and hearing John and knowing that he is alive. This was followed by the feeling of despair and helplessness.’

Addressing his son’s captors, he said: ‘To those holding John: please know that he is a good man, he sought only to help the Syrian people and I ask you from all that is sacred, to help us and allow him to return home safely to those he loves and those who love him.’
