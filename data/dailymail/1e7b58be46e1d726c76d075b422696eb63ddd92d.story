It was a gimmick proving to be quite a draw for diners at a restaurant in New York.

Traditional Iraqi cuisine served on the very dinnerware used by the Butcher of Baghdad himself was being sold in an upmarket Upper East Side restaurant for $38 a head.

However, now diners who were eating from Saddam Hussein's dinner plates will have to return to more run-of-the-mill tableware.

Spoils: Guests were eating off the gilded fine china that once served Saddam Hussein for $38 - but not from now on

He's not using them: Saddam Hussein, executed in 2006, kept several opulent palaces. The Park Avenue Autumn restaurant, right, was using some of his china

The gold-plated crockery, which was 
plundered from the dictator's palace, is to be repatriated to the Iraqi 
administration by the U.S., New York authorities have confirmed.

The items were illegally smuggled 
into the country and were later sold on eBay for about $3,000 to an art group
in New York City called Creative Time.

Some of the plates were used in an art exhibit and some ended up in the Park Avenue Autumn restaurant.

Iraqi-Jewish Chef Michael Rakowitz 
served up an Iraqi-style meal of venison and date syrup - called 
'Spoils' - which arrived on a plate that the 'Butcher of Baghdad' once 
ate from, customers were told.

Loot: Artefacts from Saddam's palaces are for sale all over Iraq

A spokesman from Manhattan's U.S. 
Attorney's Office, said: 'After being advised of the illegal status of 
the Iraqi plates Creative Time agreed to voluntarily relinquish them.'

It is thought that the plates were 
sold to U.S. troops by an Iraqi that was invited on a military base. It 
is believed the sellers on Ebay were an Iraqi refugee in Michigan and an
American soldier.

Federal prosecutors also announced on
Wednesday that stolen china that belonged to King Faisal II also was 
turned over to Iraqi diplomats.

US authorities had learned in November that the items had been discovered in the restaurant.

The Iraq dictator was captured by US forces in 2003 and executed in 2006.
