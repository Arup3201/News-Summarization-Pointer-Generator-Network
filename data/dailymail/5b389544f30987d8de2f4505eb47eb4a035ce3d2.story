Trainer Mick Channon will be looking for a longer race for Daily Mail colt First Class Mail after he failed to beat a rival home in his fourth career start at Leicester.

Hopes were high that our chestnut, who started at 7-1, would run respectably in the six-furlong Bulmer Cider Nursery. But having lost ground at the start, First Class Mail was unable to launch any sort of challenge as he trailed in 18½ lengths behind winner and 9-2 favourite White Vin Jan.

It was the worst performance of First Class Mail’s embryonic career and illustrated the ups and frequent downs of racehorse ownership.

Lack of a suitable opportunity meant he had to run at six furlongs and jockey Charlie Bishop said: ‘It is disappointing but we know he is better than that. We definitely have to go seven furlongs now.’

‘He jumped at the start and lost three lengths and then was never going. He was flat out all the way. The visor he wore didn’t seem to make any difference.

‘He was racing on his own and never had any other horse around him to help him.’

It will also be hoped that the official handicapper will reassess the rating he has given the colt in the light of this latest run.
