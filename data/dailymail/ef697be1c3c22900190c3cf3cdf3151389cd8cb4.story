Slaughtered: Marmite the micro pig, pictured, was loaned to a school because he was lonely at home

A woman who loaned her beloved micro pig to a local school to stop the animal getting lonely was shocked to find out her pet had been sent to slaughter.

Ria Dell, 21, was given Marmite as a present, but 'loaned' him to a local infant school so he would no longer be stuck in the house and could meet other pigs.

Miss Dell, who works in a sweet shop, would visit her 'docile' porcine friend several times a week in his new home at West Rise Junior School in Eastbourne, Sussex - but one day he was no longer in his pen.

When she investigated Marmite's fate, the school revealed that they had sent the animal off to be killed because of his 'aggressive' behaviour. It is claimed he bit a school site manager and even tried to attack a pupil.

Miss Dell, who says Marmite was only loaned to the school, was 'devastated' by the news, and says they had no right to kill her pet.

However, officials from the school have claimed they were within their rights to take the drastic step, consulted a vet first and even asked Miss Dell to take the pig back.

Beloved pet: Ria Dell, pictured with Marmite, maintains the school had no right to send her pig to die

Vegetarian Miss Dell said: 'I have loved pigs since I was a child and they were always my favourite animal.

'My parents bought me Marmite as a present for my 21st birthday and I was ecstatic. I treated him very much like a pet rather than livestock and he lived in the house with us as a member of the family.

'He was so soft and domesticated that he
 would sit on my lap in front of the TV, and let me stroke him. He would
 even give me kisses and cuddles. When you called his name, he would 
recognise it and come running like a dog.

'Unfortunately, it became clear he was a little lonely and I thought he would benefit from socialising with other pigs.

You would not be alone in thinking that Marmite seems on the large size for a micro pig.

However the animals, which shot to popularity because of their pint-sized reputation, are only truly tiny when they are piglets.

Adult micro pigs can easily grow to knee-height, and some shocked owners have had to content with the beasts growing even larger and causing chaos at home.

'I contacted West Rise school because I knew they had other animals and they said they would be delighted to take him.

'They had a female pig they wanted to mate and they said Marmite would make the perfect stud.

'I took him to the school on the understanding he would be boarding there. I wasn’t giving them ownership. I thought he would have a dream new start in life with some other pigs to keep him company.'

Marmite was placed into a pen with two other pigs in January this year, and within two months he was dead.

Miss Dell said: 'I visited him at the school three times a week and my mum would drive past every day.

'You could see him from the pathway outside the school, so I never needed to go in. However, one day we realised he had disappeared, which was extremely worrying.

'The school told us he had been aggressive towards the other pigs and moved to a separate pen. However, he was so docile and half the size of the ones they had.

'The school’s other male was older than Marmite and even had tusks.'

Miss Dell said she offered to take Marmite back or help to find him another home, though the school disputes this.

But she also claims the school then sent him to slaughter at Tottingworth Farm in nearby Broad Oak without letting her know.

She said: 'When I found out Marmite had been killed I was devastated. I couldn’t believe it and I was just screaming. The school had no right to kill my pet, who I loved so much. People should imagine how they would feel if somebody did that to their dog.'

The school said it removed the pig upon the recommendation of a vet and attempted to find suitable housing for him on another site.

Headteacher Mike Fairclough said: 'After a few weeks the new pig became extremely aggressive and attacked our two other pigs. It also bit the site manager and tried to bite a child.

'We contacted our vet and were advised to remove the pig from our site for the health and safety of the children and the other animals.

'The previous owners were contacted by the school to notify them of this development, but at no point did they offer to have it back or to help rehouse it.

'Our farm manager approached as many local farms as possible to rehouse the pig, but nobody wanted it because it was a boar.'
