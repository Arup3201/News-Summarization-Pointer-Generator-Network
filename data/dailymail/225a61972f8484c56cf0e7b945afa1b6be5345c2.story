It may only be the size of a matchbox, but it could pose a big threat to our native wildlife.

A baby terrapin spotted in a British canal has sparked fears among conservationists that they may have been breeding during the hot summer.

Their natural habitat is the hot, humid swamps of the US, so British waters are normally too cold for them to breed.

But the Canal and River Trust says this year’s scorching weather could have provided ideal conditions for the reptile to multiply – which it says would be ‘a disaster’ for wildlife.

In the wild, the reptiles eat native species such as frogs, fish, and ducklings.

The charity said the young terrapin was discovered last week in Regent’s Canal near Marylebone, Central London.

It is urging people to report any other sightings to establish whether they are breeding.

The popularity of terrapins as pets peaked during the late Eighties and early Nineties thanks to the hit children’s TV cartoon series, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

But many were dumped in rivers and canals after growing too big for the fish tanks in which they were kept.

The EU banned the importation of terrapins to member states in 1997 over concerns of their impact on indigenous species when released into the wild.

Adults that have been freed by their owners can be seen in British inland waters, but it is highly unusual to see a hatchling.

They can be kept as pets, but are only bred in captivity in Europe.

Ecologist Paul Wilkinson, of the Canal and River Trust, said: ‘This could be bad news for conservation.

'We’ve been concerned that increasing temperatures associated with climate change would give terrapins the conditions they need to breed, something which could be a disaster for some native wildlife.

‘We’ve heard anecdotal reports that eggs had been laid.

'Now we’ve found this juvenile, the hunt is on to see if there are more, especially if they are displaying their egg teeth – a sign that they are recent hatchlings.’

He said towns and cities, which tend to reach higher temperatures in hot weather, were the most likely places to find any offspring, adding: ‘Terrapins need extremely warm, sustained weather, something we obviously experienced over the past few months.

‘It’s particularly noticeable in towns and cities which can become “heat islands” in the summer – which could explain this finding.

‘We’d be keen to hear from anyone who has spotted a match-box-sized terrapin. It would help us to determine that they are breeding.’

The baby was spotted by biology graduate Kevin Jarvis, who lives on a boat and has nicknamed it Ninja.

He said: ‘We have quite a lot of wildlife by the boats, including about 20 adult terrapins, but this juvenile really stood out.

'You often see it basking on a piece of wood. I’ve been looking to see any more, as it’d be a sign of hatchings.’
