You might have tried everything for dry eyes.

But one Bosnian grandmother claims she has a new miracle cure: her tongue. 

Hava Cebic says she can cure all manner of eye problems with just one lick, sweeping away anything from a splinter of wood to the sticky sleep caused by a conjunctivitis infection. 

Grandmother Hava Cebic, 77, from Bosnia, says people from all over the world are flocking to her small village for her unique method to cure eye problems

Mrs Cebic, 77, has been helping her neighbours and friends with their eye problems for 40 years.

But she now claims people from nearby towns and villages are flocking to her, hoping her tongue can help with their ailment.

She claims a quick dab of her special saliva can cure allergies, dry eyes and conjunctivitis - and can even reduce the symptoms of more serious conditions like cataracts.

Recently, a Japanese craze for eyeball licking was said to have resulted in a plague of eye chlamydia, styles and conjunctivitis.

But Mrs Cebic reassures the squeamish that she always douses her tongue in alcohol before and after an eye-lick, which may prevent infection.

She discovered her tongue's mysterious healing properties when she was a little girl growing up in the small village of Crnjevo in northern Bosnia.

As a joke she pinned down her brother and licked his eyeball after he complained of dry eyes.

He told her he'd been able to see better after that.

We've all heard about people doing strange things for love, but Japanese students are taking love-induced madness to a whole new level - and putting their health at risk in the process.

The latest craze sweeping through Japan is ‘oculolinctus’ – eyeball licking as an expression of affection between young lovers.

However, it has led to a surge in cases of eye infections and can even cause blindness, doctors have warned. 

The bizarre fetish, which is also known as ‘worming’, was uncovered by the Japanese website, Naver Matome, which revealed that videos of eyeball licking have been posted on YouTube. 

So she turned her hand – or rather, her tongue – to more serious ailments.

There are times when she is able to provide a cure, when even hospitals have failed, she said.

One man had a terrible pain in his eye for which doctors said there was no cure.

Mrs Cebic was able to help him with just a single lick, she claims.

Her husband is now a convert, after his dutiful wife swept away his splinter – with her tongue.

She told Oddity Central: 'At first my husband was very confused and didn't want me to do it.'

'But one day he got a piece of wood in his eye and after I licked it out he agreed that I had a gift, and I should help others.'

She added that she has a rare 'gift' and that it is a 'miracle'.

'Now, whenever anyone has something stuck in their eye or whatever, they come to me' she said.

The procedure only takes a minute or two, and she has recorded all the names of the people she has helped over the years.

She never asks for a fee, but people often give her money to express their gratitude.

People plagued by eye problems have come from as far as Sarajevo, Zenica, Tuzla, Kaknja, Croatia and other cities in Bosnia.

She worries that her children cannot take over her work after her death, and hopes her tongue will be cut off after she dies so that it can continue its work of healing the eyes of the sick.
