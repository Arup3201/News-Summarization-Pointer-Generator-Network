A stunning Georgian townhouse which was once the home of romantic British poet Lord Byron is to be restored to its former glory – a £45million eight-bedroom mansion.

The Grade II-listed building, which is called No.139 Piccadilly and is situated in London's Mayfair, was home to Lord Byron in 1815 and it was where he wrote some of his famous works including Parisina and The Siege of Corinth.

However, in the 20th Century the elegant townhouse was converted into office space and original fittings were replaced with modern décor.

Now, after years of being used by office workers, the building is to be transformed back to its original state, with the addition of a swimming pool, sauna, gym, roof terrace and staff quarters. 

The Grade II-listed building, which is called No.139 Piccadilly and situated in London's Mayfair, was home to Lord Byron and was where he wrote some of his famous works including Parisina and The Siege of Corinth

In the 20th Century, the elegant townhouse was converted into office space and original fittings were replaced with modern décor. It will now be converted back into an eight-bedroom £45million mansion

The project will be carried out by billionaire property investors David and Simon Reuben, who already have an impressive property portfolio across the capital, including five office and residential properties in Mayfair and Battersea Heliport.

The brothers, who were born in Bombay, have a fortune of more than £7billion and are among the top 10 richest people in the UK.

Westminster City Council approved the conversion and granted planning permission on the condition that the brothers pay £500,000 towards the council's affordable housing fund.

As well as the instalment of a swimming pool and gymnasium, the works will also see the building extended to a total of 17,800 square feet.

Daniel Smith, of Motcomb, who is an architecture working on the conversion, told The Telegraph: 'There are some magnificent rooms there. We will be undertaking a careful, considered, scholarly restoration of the interior and exterior.'

The property has had a host of famous owners, most notably Lord Byron and the Duke of Queensberry.

Lord Byron, who became an overnight star thanks to his lengthy poem, Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, lived in the property in 1815 when he married and later separated from Annabella Milbanke, with whom he had a daughter.

Following the split, and Lady Byron running off with their child, he wrote: 'The moment that my wife left me I was assailed by all the falsehoods that malice could invent or slander publish; ... there was no crime too dark to be attributed to me by the moral (?) English, to account for so common an occurrence as a 'separation in high life.' 

Inside the property is a grand marble staircase, leading to to the first floor (left) while a huge skylight allows the sun to shine through on a bright day (right)

The house was given modern-decor in the 20th century but retained some features such as the fireplace (left) and the detailing around the doors (right)

The house still has Georgian detailing around door frames but it is due to be restored to its full former glory

'I was thought a devil, because Lady Byron was allowed to be an angel!'

In 1816, less than a year after the split and amid rumours surrounding his suspected relationship with half-sister Augusta, the poet fled England and never returned.

No. 139 Piccadilly was later owned by the Duke of Queensberry, who was better known by his nickname 'Old Q.'

It is believed that he used to sit on a balcony of the property and watch women as they passed by.

Lord Byron was an English romantic poet

Lord Byron, born George Gordon Noel in 1788, was an English romantic poet who wrote some of the most famous works in history.

The sixth Baron Byron, born in London – who inherited his title at just three-years-old, when his father died – shot to fame almost overnight in 1812 when his lengthy narrative of 'Childe Harold's Pilgrimage' was published.

Lord Byron, who spent his early years in Aberdeen, attended Harrow School and Cambridge University before spending two years travelling around the Mediterranean in 1809.

He returned to England two years later and it was within 12 months that the first two parts of 'Childe Harold's Pilgrimage' were released – making his name.

Following his fame, more of his works were published including The Giaour, The Bride of Abydos (1813), Parisina and The Siege of Corinth (1815).

The poet's life was not without controversy, however, and in 1814 his half-sister Augusta gave birth to a daughter – rumoured to be his.

He also indulged in an affair with Lady Caroline Lamb, who famously called him 'mad, bad and dangerous to know'.

A year later he married Annabella Milbanke, with whom he had a daughter, but the couple split in 1816.

The same year, following the separation, rumours surrounding his suspected relationship with half-sister Augusta and amid claims of debt, Lord Byron fled England and never returned.

He travelled to Belgium and then on to Switzerland before moving on to Italy, where he lived for more than six years.

During his time in Venice, he wrote some of his most notable works, including 'Don Juan' (1819-1824), but was also plagued by rumours of several affairs.

Mary Shelley, with whom he shared a house in Italy for a time, was said to be appalled at his behaviour, after he worked his way through countesses, chambermaids and aristocrats' or cobblers' wives.

After his time in Italy, Lord Byron chose to move to Greece, where he joined insurgents fighting against the Ottoman Empire.

He paid for the refitting of the Greek fleet and refunded part of the ragged revolutionary army after arriving in Greece in 1823.

Lord Byron was eventually buried  near to his ancestral home – Newstead Abbey, Nottinghamshire (above)

He died a year later of pneumonia in Messolonghi in western Greece, where a cenotaph is said to contain his heart.

His support for the Greek cause helped inspire young men from Britain, Italy and the United States to join the uprising.

Greece won its war of independence in 1832 following the intervention of the Great powers: Britain, France and Russia.

Though Byron enjoyed hero status in Greece, he was shunned in Britain.

Westminster Abbey in London refused to bury his remains in its Poets' Corner because of his Bohemian lifestyle.

His body was instead buried near to his ancestral home – Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire.

In 1938, the vicar of Hucknall, worried by persistent rumours that Lord Byron's grave in Hucknall churchyard in Nottinghamshire was empty, gained permission to open it. Inside he found Byron's perfectly embalmed body.
