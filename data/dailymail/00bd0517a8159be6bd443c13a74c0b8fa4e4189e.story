Referees are ready to clampdown on the dark arts highlighted in Sportsmail’s ‘Hands Off In The Box’ campaign.

After another weekend blighted by grappling in the penalty area, this newspaper has called for tough action on wrestling, grabbing and shirt pulling.

Premier League bosses privately agree that this escalating problem needs to be tackled. Sportsmail has been told the issue will be discussed with Professional Game Match Officials Limited, the body representing the country’s referees.

The clampdown is likely to take the same course as the approach to diving and two-footed challenges, with senior referees and their bosses first discussing how best to deal with the problem.

They are then likely to inform managers and players how they plan to interpret the rules.

Sportsmail highlighted the issue after recent inconsistency towards blatant foul play at corners and free-kicks.

Phil Dowd’s failure to penalise Manchester United players for challenges against Chelsea came a week after Stoke’s Ryan Shawcross was punished with a penalty against Swansea for a similar offence.

‘Because it’s not a change of law this is something the PGMOL can do almost immediately,’ explained former referee Graham Poll. ‘It’s simply a change of emphasis.

‘It’s just a case of establishing some consistency with all 16 of them. Do they agree it’s a yellow card, or a penalty or so on?

‘Once that is established they would contact the clubs and inform them that the players will be punished accordingly in future. When it’s as obvious as this you have to take action.’

Chelsea’s Gary Cahill has become the first defender to back our campaign. He said: ‘There’s a difference between touching the player, getting your arm across, and grabbing hold of somebody. The Ryan Shawcross one got punished recently so maybe it’s one the referees are looking at.’

John Terry, Chelsea captain

'Me and Branislav Ivanovic were double headlocked at every corner.'

Colin Pascoe, Liverpool assistant manager

'Grappling. That is the new word is it? It is the referees' interpretation and we'll leave it to them. That's what the referees and the officials are paid for. They make decisions. So whatever they decide is grappling, or holding, it's in their hands really. Did I do it as player? No, I was a winger and didn't have to mark anyone.' 

Ian Wright, Ex-Arsenal striker

'There should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set-pieces. It was like UFC in the United area.'

Graham Poll, Former top referee

'Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned. Once fans, managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims.'

Martin Keown, Ex-Arsenal defender

'Defenders are checking, blocking, holding, grappling, using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place.'

Micky Mellon, Shrewsbury Town manager

'In a congested area how can you judge if someone's been blocked? It's part of the game and some people are good at it. It's football. A local Football League referee came in and he was asking me about it. 'Can you show me some blocking techniques?' That was great, he was trying to find ways of detecting it. The confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free-kicks, but the same won't be given as penalties. There has to be consistency.'

And the readers of MailOnline...

'It's more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves. It's about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players.' Willdajack, Neath

'To those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties, that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop. I've been watching football since the Sixties and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst I've ever seen.' Sir Miles Platting, Manchester
