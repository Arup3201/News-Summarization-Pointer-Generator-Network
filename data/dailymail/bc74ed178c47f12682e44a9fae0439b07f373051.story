She was blasted during the 2011 season of X Factor by Simon Cowell who said it looked as if she'd had  five gallons of hair spray spritzed onto her tresses before standing in the middle of a hurricane.

Never one to take Cowell's criticism lying down, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has returned to top sartorial form on this year's show - and she has a carefully curated 'dream team' of experts to thank.

One of the most important is Paul Percival - one half of hair styling power duo, Percy & Reed. Their client list includes Sophie Dahl, Diane Kruger, Agyness Deyn, Anna Friel - and now Cheryl.

Only the best for Chez: Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has called on Paul Percival, a fashion favourite and celebrity hairdresser, to work his magic on her X Factor hair

Paul, who also tends to the tresses of Rita Ora and Mark Ronson for their VIP appearances and magazine shoots, works backstage with the singer every weekend and is on hand between takes.

His signature clean, modern style has made him a backstage fashion week favourite and Cheryl has benefited. 

Cheryl, who, according to Paul, is very much involved in the creative process, opted to channel French actress and model Brigitte Bardot on Sunday night's show.

Speaking about the 60s style chignon she sported, Paul said: 'For Cheryl's look, we decided to complement her beautiful structured dress with a modern twist on my hair hero Brigitte Bardot's iconic style.'

Now and then: Back on 2011's X Factor, right, Simon Cowell described Cheryl's hair as 'the equivalent of five gallons of hair spray and then standing in the middle of a hurricane'. She swiftly called in a new style squad to give her today's look, left

So how can you get the look at home? 'Find your side parting and apply Percy & Reed Abundantly Bouncy Volumising Mousse through damp hair to give bounce and texture before blow-drying the hair with a round brush,' says Paul, sneakily working in a plug for his own brand of haircare.

Spot Paul! He works backstage with Cheryl every weekend and is on hand in between takes to ensure her mane is coiffed to perfection

Next, he suggests sectioning off the crown of the head and inserting three large rollers. 

'Warm with the hair dryer, mist with L'Oreal Paris Heat Protect Styling Spray in 3 Day Wave and leave until they are completely cold to touch,' he adds.

Next, section off hair from behind each ear to the back of the head in a horseshoe shape and mist with some volumising spray before lightly back brushing.

He continues: 'Once you have an even padding around the crown gently brush the top layer of hair smooth to cover back brushing. 

'Take the remaining hair to one side and secure in a low pony with a hook band. Spray with hairspray to finish.'

His top tip? 'When back brushing don't hold the end of the hair too tight as you will break your hair. 

'Pull hair down gently all the way to the root to ensure you create a strong base for your style.'

Paul, who says he aims to create products with personality and a comfortable salon where egos are left at the door, added: ‘Working with Cheryl is such a pleasure. She is never afraid to try new things and it’s a real collaborative partnership.’
