The widow of a New Jersey police officer killed in a violent shoot out has heard his heart beat again four years after it was donated to a Vietnam war vet.

Don Zolkiwsky, who says he thinks of his donor every day, has finally met the family who helped give him the gift of life.

For Mary DiNardo, it was an emotional experience, as she hugged the war vet and said: 'This is the heart that fell in love with me.'

Her husband, Marc DiNardo, died the day before his 38th birthday after being shot in the face and neck and his Swat team tried to arrest a couple of armed robbers.

Despite several attempts to resuscitate him, the father-of-three died a few days after the deadly shootout in July 2009.

The cop, who had spent ten years on the force, had two daughters aged 4 and 1, and a son aged 3Â  when he died.

'It was two nights before they finally 
took him to surgery to harvest his organs,' Mary DiNardo told CBS News. 'I'm hoping to be able to hear that 
heartbeat again.'

The cop, who was promoted to detective after the shooting, was remembered as a selfless man adored by his colleagues.

'He had a personality you could never
forget. When he walked into a room, we all loved him,' New Jersey 
police officer Michelle Bartholomew told the Star Ledger after the incident.

After receiving the donated heart, Mr 
Zolkiwsky wrote to Mrs DiNardo to try to express his gratitude and 
explain his feelings of survivor's guilt.

'I can't explain it, but there is a deep
sense of comfort and connection with the donor whom I've never met,' he
wrote.

'Saying "thank you" in person will lift some of the guilt that I
carry as the survivor.'

Contact between donor families and recipients is becoming more common and can sometimes bring comfort, according to USA Today.

After surgery both families are told basic details about the others' circumstances and, if either side wants to send a letter, health workers act as a go between.

For Mr Zolkiwsky, he wanted to be able to thank the family who helped him.

He told CBS he couldn't stop thinking about the man whose death gave him a second chance at life, after his own heart deteriorated because of a virus.

I've had dreams consistently about 
the episode with the shootout.

'I could almost
sense what it must have been like to be in a room with a gun battle 
going on. That had to be horrific,' Mr Zolkiwsky, who was awarded a purple heart in Vietnam, said.

'He is like a 
buddy through the service,. It's a bond, it's a friendship 
that I can't describe how the feeling is, but it's an intense one.'

For Mrs DiNardo, just knowing her husband's heart is still beating has brought her some comfort.

'Marc's still living. You know, a piece of him is living inside this man,' she said.
