Flying ants ready themselves for take-off: The first major UK survey of the creatures' aerial habits has revealed there is no one 'flying ant day'

The UK's first major study of 'flying ant day' has revealed not one but two flying ant days, and indeed large numbers of ants were reported over two flying ant weeks.

When the UK’s garden ants took to the air this summer, the Society of Biology received over 6,000 reports from members of the public as part of its first flying ant survey.

Professor Adam Hart, an ecologist and insect expert at the University of Gloucestershire, presented the results of the survey at a Biology Week awards ceremony last night.

He said: 'Each year males and virgin queens take part in remarkable mating flights. So-called "flying ant day" is one of the rituals of our summer, and this year we turned anecdotal evidence into a scientific study.

'We found a relationship between flying ant swarms and weather conditions, which we expected, and geographical variation, which we didn’t expect.'

About one-in-five sightings happened on Tuesday 24th July, and another one in five came two weeks later on Wednesday 8th August.

These peaks were extremely striking, but still these two flying ant days accounted for fewer than half of the records.

In fact, flying ants were a common sight for the days in July and August around the two peaks.

The time between the two peaks was a period of low pressure, which is usually associated with clouds, wind and rain. This suggests that the weather had a large role to play in determining when the ants flew.

Swarming: The most common flying ants seen around Britain are black garden ants - Lasius niger

What scientists don’t yet know is 
whether these two peaks happened because the first peak was interrupted 
by bad weather, or whether this is a common pattern.

The survey will continue over the next few years to explore this question further.

Interestingly, there was no evidence 
of a trend across the UK, with no difference in timing between the north
and south. The geographical pattern was in fact very complex, and it is
likely that local conditions played an important role.

'Even
over a small area, emergences happened on different days, suggesting 
that local synchronisation is not as precise as is widely believed,' 
said Professor Hart.

Flying ant day outbreaks occur when male ants and females - potential queens - head to the skies to find a partner.

By far the most common flying ants are the black garden ant, Lasius niger. The ants we see throughout the year are workers (sterile females), but flying ants are males and new queens undergoing their nuptial flight.

Sadly for the males, they die soon after, while the females go on to build new colonies.

Queens can live for around 10-15 years and only mate once. Having mated, a new queen will drop her wings then start her own colony.

Once she has dug a nest she will lay her first eggs, and use her wing muscles for energy until the first workers are ready to forage.

Over the next few years she will keep laying eggs and her colony will typically reach 5,000 workers, but some grow to have 15,000.

Despite its miniscule size, the black garden ant has a huge impact on our countryside, from improving soil to pollination and pest control.

They are also an important source of food for many other creatures; many people are alerted to the presence of flying ants by the sound of feasting gulls.

'This 
is a clear example of the value of turning anecdotal evidence into a 
scientific study.

'It will be fascinating to see whether this holds true 
every year.'

One factor which was very consistent was the time at which the ants emerged: normally between 4pm and 6pm.

This suggests that, although weather affects whether ants swarm that day, it doesn’t affect the time of day they fly.

'Mid-afternoon
flights make sense: this gives them just enough time to find somewhere 
to hide, but not too much time for exposure to predators,' said 
Professor Hart.

'They can’t risk flying at night because they can’t see and it’s too cold, so the afternoon is a good way to hedge bets.'

Dr
Mark Downs, Chief Executive of the Society of Biology, said: 'These 
results show the power of data collected by volunteers.

'By looking out 
for flying ants and taking a few minutes to fill out our survey they 
have allowed us to do research which scientists couldn’t possibly do on 
their own. Thank you to everyone who submitted their results.'

Creatures of habit: The decision over whether to take to the skies seemed to be correlated with the weather. One factor which was consistent was the time at which the ants emerged, normally between 4pm and 6pm

Professor
Hart added: 'I’m really pleased with the data that everyone has helped 
us to collect. We are going to be able to find out much more about this 
natural phenomenon that seems to fascinate and appal people in equal 
measure every summer.'

Christina
Catlin-Groves, a PhD student at the University of Gloucestershire, 
said: 'These findings are just the tip of the iceberg.

'At
the moment we just have one year’s worth of data and with the unusual 
summer we have had we really need more years to let us build up the 
bigger picture.

'It will be exciting to see what next year brings so please keep an eye out for Flying Ant Survey 2013.'
