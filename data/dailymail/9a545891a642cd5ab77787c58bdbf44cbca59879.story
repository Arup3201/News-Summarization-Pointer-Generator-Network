Thankful: Ali Stunt is a pancreatic cancer survivor who owes her life to a locum GP

Ali Stunt was bent double with crippling pains under her ribcage when she went to her GP.

‘I’d already been to the practice three times in as many weeks because it was so intense,’ recalls Ali, 47, a former geochemist who lives with her husband Phil, 49, a financial IT director, and their two sons, James, 19, and Nick, 16, in Haslemere, Surrey.

‘The pains had started in the centre of my back above my bra strap four weeks earlier. I couldn’t sit back in a chair or get comfortable in bed.

‘There was no lump sticking out as such, but it felt like I had a tennis ball in between my shoulder blades. The pain gradually moved round to my front under my rib cage and was much worse after I’d eaten.

‘I completely went off food and lost a stone in just a few weeks. I was also suffering from bouts of diarrhoea which I’d never had before. I was really worried.’

One of the regular GPs told her she had indigestion and prescribed the antacid Gaviscon. When the pain got worse and Ali went back a week later, she was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and prescribed an anti-spasmodic drug.

On her third visit, Ali told a third GP the pain had shifted from her back to under her ribcage. He said it was probably stomach irritation caused by the anti-inflammatory painkillers she’d been prescribed previously, and gave her codeine instead. ‘But this didn’t touch the pain,’ says Ali.

‘On my fourth visit, I saw a locum GP. She was a lot more thorough than the other doctors had been and asked me lots of detailed questions. She even phoned the local hospital’s A&E surgical specialist to get a second opinion.

‘I sensed the locum had a hunch it was something serious, as she urged me to go to A&E if the pain worsened.’

She went to A&E, but it was a Bank Holiday and no scans were being done. Ali was sent back to the GP.

‘I saw the same locum again and she looked very concerned and insisted I needed an urgent referral. She referred me to a pancreatic surgeon, which probably saved my life. Had I been sent to a different type of specialist, such as a gastroenterologist, it might have been too late.’

Scans taken two days later by the specialist revealed a 5cm cancerous tumour in the middle of Ali’s pancreas. She had been just weeks away from being inoperable as the tumour was growing next to major blood vessels.

‘I’m alive five-and-a-half years later because a locum made the right call. My own GP admitted to me after my surgery that he’d never have picked up my cancer because I was young and otherwise healthy,’ says Ali.

‘You hear so many negative things about locums missing things — but I think the fact that I was seen by someone who was looking at me through a fresh pair of eyes, and who was perhaps more up-to-date in their knowledge, saved my life.’

There are an estimated 15,000 GPs working as locums in the UK. They make up a quarter of the general practice workforce and see 36 million patients a year. A locum is a fully qualified doctor who provides temporary cover to fill a vacancy or cover sick leave, staff holidays or training commitments.

Many newly qualified doctors work as locums to gain experience. There are also older doctors who want more flexibility and doctors from overseas, as well as retired doctors, who take up locum posts.

‘I’ve seen a jump in the number of GP partners leaving their regular practices mid-career to become locums, mostly from the sheer burden of extra paperwork and clinics they have to do,’ says Dr

Richard Fieldhouse, a GP locum and chief executive of the National Association of Sessional GPs. ‘Also, many more GPs these days are female. Working freelance as a locum can offer those with families a much better work-life balance.’

However, even though locums are trained to the same level as other doctors, many people are unwilling to see the ‘stand-in’. 

This is partly because locums tend to make the headlines only when things go wrong. For instance, German GP locum Dr Daniel Ubani was struck off by the General Medical Council in 2010 after being found guilty of serious clinical failings. One of his patients was given a fatal tenfold overdose of diamorphine.

While the General Medical Council doesn’t collect figures about complaints against GP locums, experts say public perception is that numbers are high.

‘This idea that locums are somehow second-rate doctors is unfair,’ says Dr Fieldhouse. ‘I hear so much about patients wanting continuity of care — which is true — but with continuity can  sometimes come complacency. If a GP is seeing a patient repeatedly about a problem, it can sometimes be hard to spot what is wrong because the changes creep up over time.

‘A locum might walk in and spot it straight away. They may also find it easier to say difficult things such as the patient needs to lose weight or give up smoking.’

Dr Richard Vautry, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s General Practice Committee, agrees that sometimes seeing a different doctor, whether from within the practice or elsewhere, can be a good thing.

But he adds: ‘The patient doesn’t have the same relationship of trust with a locum that they have with their family doctors and if a consultation doesn’t go the way they were expecting, they can be more likely to make a complaint.’

Shehnaz Somjee, a surgeon and chair of the Locum Doctors’ Association, a professional body representing 4,000 locums, says stand-in doctors are often subject to more rigorous scrutiny than regular GPs. ‘Locums have to prove themselves in every job. When you start a new post, all the other staff eye your work through the microscope. If any slight mistake is made, it creates immediate alarm.’

Miss Somjee says a locum’s varied experience can stand them in good stead. ‘I know one locum who, because of his wide experience in different general practices, was able to spot an adverse drug reaction when the patient’s own doctor failed to do so.’

Like Ali, Catherine Jones, 28, a charity worker from London, also owes her life to a newly qualified doctor at a university practice.

‘I saw my family GP in Hampshire several times over a period of a year about a mole that had appeared in the middle of my back. It was getting bigger, it was raised and was changing colour and I worried about it constantly,’ says Catherine.

‘But he just kept saying it was nothing to worry about and sent me away repeatedly. When I started university in Sheffield, I went to the university practice and saw a locum GP.

‘Far from fobbing me off as my GP had done previously, this doctor took one look at it and made an urgent referral for me to see a dermatologist.

‘A week later, I was seen by the specialist who told me that it was malignant melanoma — the  worst and most aggressive type of skin cancer.’

Catherine had her operation to remove the cancerous mole a week later — luckily before the cancer could spread to other parts of the body. ‘It was the vigilance of the locum doctor that made that timely referral.

‘My GP was older, in his 50s, and had practised in a small rural town — maybe he had just got complacent and too set in his ways.’

Ali has since made a full recovery and set up the charity Pancreatic Cancer Action. ‘I never saw that locum doctor again — but it’s because of her being so diligent and making the referral to exactly the right specialist that I’m still here today.

‘I owe her a big thank you. Seeing a locum really did save my life.’
