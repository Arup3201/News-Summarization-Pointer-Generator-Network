Furious: Charities are angry George Osborne is planning to cap tax relief on donations

Charities went to war with Downing Street last night after wealthy donors were branded tax dodgers.

No 10 said many are giving money to bogus charities, some of them abroad, to claim income tax relief and wipe out their liabilities.

But furious charities said the accusations – for which Downing Street has produced no evidence – were a desperate attempt to justify George Osborne’s plan to cap tax relief on donations. 

More than 800 charities, including Cancer Research UK and Macmillan Cancer Care, have signed up to a campaign called ‘Give it Back George’ to persuade the Chancellor to drop his plans, outlined in the Budget.

They warned that the cap, set at 25 per cent of a donor’s income if he or she is giving more than £50,000, will hurt already struggling charities.

Last night Dame Stephanie Shirley, who has given away £60million herself, accused the Government of ‘a cack-handed assault on philanthropic giving’.

Dame Stephanie, who runs a group called Ambassadors for Philanthropy, said the charity sector would lose ‘hundreds of millions of pounds’ a year.

In an open letter to David Cameron, she said: ‘These plans are already discouraging major giving, with donors informing charities privately of their intention to put on hold plans to give five-, six- or even seven-figure sums.

‘They will, if enacted, significantly hamper the work of many charities, large and small, as almost half of all giving comes from just 7 per cent of donors.’

The Government’s claims that there is a widespread problem with the wealthy  funnelling cash to bogus charities was quickly shot down by the Charity Commission.

The watchdog, which registers charities and investigates claims of wrongdoing, said it had never been contacted by the Treasury about the issue.

The ‘charity tax’ is the latest public relations disaster to hit the Government as a result of the Budget, following the unpopular ‘granny tax’ to freeze tax allowances for pensioners and the ‘pasty tax’ to put VAT on hot snacks.

David Cameron's official spokesman accused major charitable donors of 'exploiting' the system to pay less tax

The Chancellor went on the attack yesterday, saying he was ‘shocked to see that some of the very wealthiest people in the country had organised their tax affairs so that they were regularly paying virtually no income tax.’

David Cameron’s official spokesman 
then accused major charitable donors of ‘exploiting’ the system to pay 
less in tax than the average family.

‘In certain instances they may be 
giving to charities and those charities don’t, in all cases, do a great 
deal of charitable work,’ the spokesman said.

Government
 officials said the Chancellor had been shown examples by Revenue and 
Customs officials of wealthy people who have thrown lavish ‘footballers’
 wives’ style parties and then claimed that they were charitable 
fundraisers to get tax relief.

Taxpayers may claim relief on donations made to any charity based in the EU. 

But
 charities and critics said that if the Government wants to stamp out 
abuse it should close loopholes rather than impose a blanket cap that 
will hurt some of Britain’s best-loved charities.

John
 Low, chief executive of the Charities Aid Foundation, said: 
‘Philanthropists who make large donations give away far, far more than 
they could ever claim in tax relief.

‘We should recognise and celebrate them,  not brand them wealthy tax dodgers.’ 

The foundation said the biggest 100 donors, who will be hit hardest by the plans, handed over £1.67billion last year, an average of £17million each.

Charities, including WaterAid, claim they will suffer under the cap, which will leave them struggling to survive

Chris Bain, director of Catholic charity Cafod, said: ‘Mr Osborne is using a sledgehammer to crack an over-exaggerated nut.

‘It cannot make sense to punish the vast majority of honest charities and philanthropists for the supposed actions of a minority.

‘It is insulting for the Treasury to brand Britain’s many great charitable givers tax avoiders. We hope the Chancellor will listen to reason and rethink this ill-judged, ill-designed tax.’ 

Laws introduced only last year already crack down on ‘tainted donors’, tycoons who funnel money into charitable trusts that ultimately benefit them.

Another law imposed a ‘fit and proper test’, meaning that if a donor wants to claim tax relief for a charity abroad, it has to be rubber-stamped as a genuine charity by the UK authorities.

John Hemming, chairman of Charities Tax Group, which advises charities on tax, said: ‘If this cap has been designed to tackle abuse, I’m surprised they don’t feel comfortable with the legislation they have only recently implemented.’ The Treasury has promised to discuss how to minimise the effects of the plan on charities.

More than 800 charities have put their names to the Give it Back George campaign

But Treasury minister David Gauke held meetings with charities last week and sources said he ‘did not budge one inch’.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘Reliefs exist for good reason but it is not right that wealthy individuals can use them without limit to reduce their income tax bills to close to zero, often year after year.

‘There will still be tax relief for donations  to charity. 

‘We remain committed to supporting philanthropy, which is why we are proactively exploring with philanthropists ways to ensure this new limit will not significantly impact upon charities that depend on large donations.’
