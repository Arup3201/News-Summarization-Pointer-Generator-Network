The family of a two-year-old diagnosed with a rare brain tumour say they have been forced to beg for their daughter's life – after she was refused NHS funding for treatment.

John Paul Bevan and his wife Katherine say the Welsh NHS is denying their daughter a 'chance at life' by refusing to fund proton beam therapy.

The desperate couple say the pioneering treatment is the best chance that their daughter Freya has at beating her rare but deadly, primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET).

They now need to raise £250,000 to fund the treatment – which is only available abroad - as they believe it is less invasive than radiotherapy, which can have devastating side effects.

The family of two-year-old Freya Bevan, who has been diagnosed with a rare brain tumour, say they have lost their dignity in begging for their daughter's life

Mr and Mrs Bevan want to take Freya to the U.S. for proton beam therapy, but have been turned down for funding from the Welsh NHS. Mrs Bevan said: 'The Welsh NHS haven't given her a chance of life. It's absolutely disgusting'

Proton beam therapy is an advanced form of radiotherapy that targets tumours with great precision.

It is not available in the UK, but the NHS sometimes offers funding for some patients to go abroad if their care team thinks they are ideally suited to receive proton beam therapy. 

Mr and Mrs Bevan - who have both work for the NHS - fear they may have to follow in the footsteps of the parents of Ashya King who rejected NHS advice and took their own children abroad for the treatment when the NHS refused to fund it.

Mrs Bevan said: 'The Welsh NHS haven't given her a chance of life.

'It's absolutely disgusting. We've both worked for the NHS for a long time, but now we want something back, but they can't help us.

'They have made us lose our dignity and beg for our daughter's life.'

Freya was diagnosed with the tumour in May last year and has since fought through numerous operations and sessions of chemotherapy - coming back from death more than once.

Mr and Mrs Bevan, who live in Neath, South Wales, want to take her for specialist proton beam therapy in America to save her life.

The family has already raised £80,000 to pay for accommodation across the pond, after receiving support from the Welsh rugby team and ex-Arsenal star and cancer survivor John Harston.

They applied to the Welsh Health Specialist Services Committee but were turned down.

Now they need to raise a further £170,000 to cover the cost of the treatment - and they face a race against time as the tumour could grow at any moment.

Freya was diagnosed with the tumour in May last year and has since fought through numerous operations and sessions of chemotherapy. The family need to raise £250,000 for the proton beam therapy treatment, and have so far raised £80,000

If they can't raise enough money for treatment, Freya will have to have radiotherapy — which has a high chance of leaving her unable to live an independent life.

Mr Bevan highlighted the case of Ashya King's family, and said: 'Ninety per cent of me wishes we had done what they did.'

Ashya's family removed him from Southampton Hospital, taking him to Europe last year, for the pioneering treatment, which was later paid for by the NHS.

The family had raised similar concerns about radiotherapy.

A Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee spokeswoman said proton beam therapy is only commissioned on a very limited basis, and clinical guidelines define which cancers the therapy is an effective treatment for.

Swansea City are set to wear special wristbands to raise awareness of Freya's plight when they take on Manchester United tomorrow.

Proton beam therapy is an advanced form of radiotherapy that targets tumours with great precision.

The radiation that uses beams of protons - small parts of an atom - rather than high energy X-rays, used in conventional radiotherapy.

Unlike an X-ray, the proton stops after striking the target rather than continuing to travel through the body.

It enables therapists to direct the beam at a tumour more precisely.

Proton beam therapy is an advanced form of radiotherapy that targets tumours with great precision. It is not available on the NHS, but sometimes the health service funds patients going abroad for the treatment

The beam can be more finely controlled, in both its width and its depth, so higher doses of radiation can be more safely delivered to tumours, with less risk to healthy tissues. 

The therapy is not available in the UK, though the NHS will fund sending patients abroad if their care team thinks they are ideally suited to receive proton beam therapy.

Around 400 patients – mostly children – have been abroad since 2008.

The NHS choices website says: ‘Some overseas clinics providing proton beam therapy heavily market their services to parents who are understandably desperate to get treatment for their children.

‘Proton beam therapy can be very costly and it is not clear whether all children treated privately abroad are treated appropriately.

‘It is important not to lose sight of the fact that conventional radiotherapy is, in most cases, both safe and effective with a low risk of complications.’
