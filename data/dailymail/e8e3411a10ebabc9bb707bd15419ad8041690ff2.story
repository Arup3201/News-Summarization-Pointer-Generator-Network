A mother has filmed the moment her five-year-year girl decided to give her a telling-off about the 'mess' in their house and her brother's bad behaviour.

Saige, five, who's from the US, concludes the passionate rant by declaring she will move out and stay with her mum's best friend: 'I'm moving on, I'm going to Jenn's!' 

Unfortunately for her, her mother refuses to take the threat seriously and just laughs at her daughter, responding: 'No you're not.'

'I'm MOVING!' says five-year-old Saige, who has had enough of living with her mother for five years

In the video titled, 'Saige is mad and she's moving on', the determined little girl, gives her mother a stern nod and replies: 'Yes I am!'

When her mother - who hasn't revealed her name but posts videos under YouTube channel Fourth St. James - asks her why she has to move out, Saige says she's been in the house 'way too long... for, like, five years'.

She tells her mother what's behind her bad mood, explaining: 'I need to move on sometimes'.

Saige then adds: 'I will make Jenn's house as clean as I can make it.

Her mother replies: 'Why can't you make my house clean?'

'Because I don't love you,' says Saige, 'This is way dirty, it has no space. My room is a disaster, it has no room and I can barely have room to put my stuff.'

'If Tanner wants me to move, I'm moving!' says Saige, who is upset with her brother for throwing dirt at her

Her brother Tanner - with whom she is 'mad' - teases: 'What are you going to do at Jenn's house?'

Defiant Saige says: 'I have lots of stuff. I'm moving on!'

'I'm going to miss you!' says mum.

'If Tanner wants me to move, I'm moving!' says Saige.

She says she doesn't care if her mum is sad, and that she will move to Jenn's 'probably after tomorrow'.

Her brother throwing dirt at her is also partly to blame.

The state of the house is also a problem. 'This is way dirty, it has no space. My room is a disaster,' says Saige
