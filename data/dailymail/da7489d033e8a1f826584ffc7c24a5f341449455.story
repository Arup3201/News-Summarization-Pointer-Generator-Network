Controversy: Shilpa Shetty has become embroiled in a betting row over matches in the Indian Premier League

Celebrity Big Brother star and Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty has become embroiled in a betting scandal over matches in cricket's richest league.

Shilpa, who co-owns Indian Premier League team Rajasthan Royals with her husband Raj Kundra, has been accused of placing bets on matches that her own team played in.

The allegations were made by Umesh Goenka, an alleged bookmaker who is a witness in an investigation into a spot-fixing scandal that has hit the league.

Delhi police chief Neeraj Kumar said that Shilpa's husband Mr Kundra had admitted to betting on his own team and lost 'huge sums of money' in the process, according to the BBC.

Officers have now confiscated British national Mr Kundra's passport and told him he must stay in India.

Police may question Shilpa too after Mr Goenka claimed that she had placed a bet on a Rajasthan Royals game against the Kolkata Knight Riders, reports India Today.

She told Headlines Today that her and her husband have done nothing wrong.

Shipa shot to fame in 207 after her appearance on the fifth series of Celebrity Big Brother.

The bollywood star met Kundra after her appearance on Big Brother, which saw her allegedly racially abused and tormented by fellow contestants Jade Goody, Danielle Lloyd and Jo O'Meara.

Despite the controversy, she went on to win the show.

Last month three Rajasthan Royals players, S Sreesanth, Ajit Chandila and Ankeet Chavan, were all arrested by police and accused of spot-fixing, a practice which involves rigging parts of a match such as timing the delivery of a no-ball to benefit gamblers.

Sreesanth has protested his innocence and the families of the other two players have denied that they were involved.

The players have been suspended by both the Rajasthan Royals and the IPL.

They remain in police custody.

The biggest names in international cricket have flocked to take part in the IPL's Twenty20 tournament.

The league is regarded as the richest cricket tournament in the world.
