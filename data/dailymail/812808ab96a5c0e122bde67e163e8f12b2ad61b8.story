Fraudster: Emma Charlton, pictured at an earlier court hearing, admitted to using her mother's bank card to buy £823 of goods, including Apple products

A serial fraudster who faked terminal cancer so her boyfriend would propose, and has posed as a children's doctor and even the editor of Vogue, has been convicted of conning her own mother.

Emma Charlton, 30, used her mother's bank card to order goods from the internet worth £800, which she ordered under one of her many aliases.

In her former guises she would wear designer clothes and even carry around a toy miniature dog to create the impression of being a high-flyer.

She pleaded guilty to one charge of fraud at Newcastle Magistrates' Court this week - the latest in a long series of deceptions, often involving her lovers and close family members, which have totalled hundreds of thousands of pounds.

Charlton, who was born Emma Golightly, and has also used the names Amelia Chadwick and Jamie Taylor, had only recently been released from prison, where she was serving an 18-month sentence for previous charges of fraud.

In her most audacious gambit, in 2008 she told a previous lover, Neil Lupton, that she was the African-born daughter of a judge, and a photographer whose work had featured in the fashion magazine Vogue.

Under this pretence she duped her boyfriend, who believed her fake backstory, into thinking she was suffering from terminal cancer.

Aged just 25, she said that her dying wish was to be walked down the aisle in a lavish white wedding.

Plans were made for an £80,000 ceremony at Edwardian Slaley Hall Hotel in Northumberland, with Charlton deciding they would need to book out every room in the hotel. When a £10,000 deposit was request, she produced a cheque for the amount - which had been stolen from her grandmother.

Incredibly, she also chose this point to substantially upgrade her phoney career, telling staff that she was in fact the editor of Vogue. She told the lie despite bearing no obvious resemblance to the long-serving chief of the fashion magazine, Anna Wintour.

However, her fantasy unravelled when a £10,000 cheque she had provided as a deposit - which had been stolen from her own grandmother - bounced.

A court later heard how Mr Lupton - who at first refused to believe that his fiancée had lied so comprehensively, 'had been thoroughly and totally conned.'

The judge at the hearing told Charlton: 'It was a cruel thing you did to him.' Many of the cheques, stolen from Mr Lupton and her grandmother, were not honoured, but Mr Lupton and various financial institutions were left with a £40,000 bill for those that were.

Earlier in her false life of fashion photography, Charlton hit a bump in the road when a £2,800 cheque she paid to the Hilton Hotel in Gateshead for a fashion event in aid of cancer charities was cancelled on the day.

She claimed the event had to stop because the clothes for the models had failed to turn up.

In this most recent case the victim was again a member of her family. The most recent court hearing was told how Charlton had made the fraudulent purchases on her mother's card in July 2013, using the name Jamie Taylor.

Three purchases were made, totalling £823,65.

Claire Thomasson, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant obtained her mother’s bank details and charged a number of high-value items to her mum’s card.

'Her mum doesn’t discover anything until she goes to a cashpoint and checks her bank balance.

“She realised a number of Apple items had been purchased from John Lewis, as well as other items and groceries. These were purchases she had not made. Further inquiries reveal the goods have been sent to someone called Jamie Taylor.

'The defendant’s mum knew the defendant was in the process of changing her name to that, so she made the connection. The police were then called.'

Charlton, who has five convictions, for 46 offences, including 39 for fraud, wept as she listened from the dock.

Liz Dunbar, mitigating, said the offence had been committed soon after she’d been released from prison when she was 'not in a good place'.

She said: 'She was recalled when this offence came to light. She has since got her life back on track. She is seeking assistance in the form of counselling. She has recently started blacking out and she has an implant to monitor her heart.

'She has now found employment as a barber and has a new partner, who knows about her record.'

Incredibly, the court was told that her mother, Lynn Golightly, was continuing to support Charlton through the case.

After pleading guilty to one charge of fraud by false representation, Charlton, from Newcastle, was given an 18-month community order.

Charlton has been given a total of three prison sentences for her series of frauds. She has conned a total of six men - three of whom offered to marry her after believing her story about dying from cancer.

2004: Emma Golightly - as she was then known - runs up a £7,000 bill on her mother's credit card. When challenged she leaves the family home in disgrace.

2007: Golightly is jailed for conning five men, her mother, grandmother and brother out of £254,000. Two of the men had fallen for her cancer story and agreed to marry her.

2008-2009: As her romance with Mr Lutpon progresses, Charlton steals cheques from her grandmother and boyfriend totalling £150,000. They were made up of 19 cheques from her grandmother, totalling £126,387 and nine cheques from Mr Lupton, worth £28,402. Not all of them were honoured.

Early 2009: Charlton tells Mr Lupton she's dying of cancer, prompting their ill-fated plans to wed at Slaley Hall Hotel, where she tells staff she is the editor of Vogue.
