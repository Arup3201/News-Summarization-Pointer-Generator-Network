It's not uncommon for guests to leave with towels, dressing gowns and toiletries when they check out after a stay in a hotel.

But staff at the Heavitree Gap Outback Lodge are actually encouraging visitors not to walk away empty-handed if they stay for a weekend in November. 

The motel, in Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory, wants you to take a complimentary bed, fridge, TV and microwave when you leave because the complex is being redeveloped.

If that's not enough, owners of the soon-to-be-refurbished resort also want you take the  table, chairs, curtains, clock, beds, linen -  and even the carpet - as you check out.

It has been called the 'motel mayhem' deal and is available for couples on the weekend of November 14 and 15 for $350 per room.

'You can take everything!' assistant manager Sharon Roberts told Daily Mail Australia.

'We're getting rid of everything because our motel is getting a redevelopment.'

But the deal excludes plumbing and anything electrical that is hard-wired.

'But if guests pay an extra $300, we'll throw in a split system air conditioner and we'll provide degassing by a qualified electrician and removal from the wall inside the motel unit,' she said.

You won't go hungry, either, with the motel offering 25 per cent off meals during the sale.

'Come in, there's plenty of beds, fridges, TVs, linen and furniture to go around for everyone.'

All left over items will be put to auction for the public on November 15 at 3pm. 

The hotel also offers  a truly unique outback experience with spectacular views of some of Australia's most famous natural wonders, including the MacDonnell Ranges, Standley Chasm and Simpson's Gap.

The resort offers more than just some cheap used furniture. Guests can also enjoy a relaxing paradise
