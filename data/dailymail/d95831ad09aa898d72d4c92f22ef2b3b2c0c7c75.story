BDanny Cohen has unveiled a range of measures after admitting bloated management structures at the BBC can 'stifle creativity'

It probably seemed like a good idea at the time going 'back to the floor' to reconnect with rank and file BBC staff.

But the reality of working as a 'runner' on a frantic Saturday night live show maybe quite a lot trickier than £300,000-a-year director Danny Cohen imagined.

The BBC’s Director of Television has announced that he will start work as the most junior of assistants on Strictly Come Dancing this autumn in a bid to address the corporation's overly 'hierarchical structures.'

He will also send his fellow senior managers to take up in junior roles on other shows to gain direct experience of the production process.

Cohen's decision to run errands on the Saturday night entertainment show, which has just begun its eleventh series is part of a wider shake-up in BBC culture designed to 'give more status and seniority' to creative people and revitalise the often criticised bloated ranks of management.

Despite his illustrious career with the corporation Mr Cohen admitted that he had never before held the unglamourous role of 'runner' which in many cases amounts to that of a general dogsboddy.

Nevertheless the former BBC3 chief said he was excited at the prospect of trying out the role for the first time.

He said: 'I didn’t do running because I started in documentary programmes and so I started as a junior researcher, I'm really looking forward to it.'

Mr Cohen has also voiced concerns that the BBC's existing structure can 'stifle creativity' as those who involved in production are perceived as less valued than the organisation’s managers.

And his initiatives to re-address the balance could not come any sooner as the BBC faces a crisis over its senior management structure and salaries.

Just last week the payoffs awarded to departing executives became the subject of sharp criticism by the National Audit Office and the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee.

Speaking to the Independent, Mr Cohen said he wanted his highly paid managers to have a 'closer understanding' of how things actually work in production.

He said: 'I think we senior managers should have a closer understanding of what it’s like on the ground in production, at the coal face, making the programmes and I’m going to encourage all my senior team to be runners and do similar things in the next few weeks.

Re-connect: Mr Cohen believes his plan to work as a runner on the popular show is the best way for senior staff to identify with those working 'at the coal face'

'Up until now in the BBC to get status and seniority you have had to become a manager and I want to break that philosophy and give more status and seniority to the most creative people without burdening them with everything which goes with management which can be distracting and is not the best use of their time.

'It’s a way of giving higher profile to creativity and ideas development and benefiting people who don’t want to become managers but are crucial to the future of the BBC because they are some of our strongest creative. That’s quite a big change in philosophy for us really.'

The plans follow in a similar vein to one of the corporation's own TV shows 'Back to the Floor', in which business figures including Ann Summers boss Jacqueline Gold and former Millwall chairman Theo Paphitis, are filmed returning to junior roles in their own companies.

Mr Cohen also announced that he wants to assemble a team of half a dozen senior creative figures to re-energise certain parts of the organisation.

But critics point out that the BBC already has a Creative Director in Alan Yentob, who is paid £183,500, plus a second salary for presenting the landmark arts strand Imagine.

The new roles will be called 'Creative Labels' and will be based in a new unit called 'Development Central.'

They will be tasked with bringing new creative energy to under-performing areas across BBC networks and the Director says he hopes the roles will help encourage individuals from outside the BBC to join the organisation.

Oxford graduate Mr Cohen, 38, was appointed director of television in April with a salary package worth £327,800.

Previously he spent three years in charge of BBC Three before moving to BBC One, where he has commissioned popular shows including Call The Midwife and The Voice.

He has repeatedly voiced his concerns that the broadcaster has become over-reliant on middle-class  viewers and is at risk of losing touch with the rest of society.

And it seems this insistence on re-connecting will remain a common thread in his approach to his new leadership role.

Reflecting the much criticised management structures of the corporation he admitted that 'current structures can stifle the energy and creativity of individuals.'

He added: 'We have been too siloed before and have risked having too hierarchical structures and the changes I have been trying to make are about releasing creative energy from those siloes and hierarchies.'

In a further effort to shake up the big wigs an encourage those further down the corporate ladder to contribute, BBC staff who come up with ideas for programme formats will now see their names on the credits at the end of those programmes.

In the past senior executives and producers have claimed credit for shows on behalf of their more junior staff.

Mr Cohen said: 'Everyone who develops an idea will get a credit, we haven’t had a consistent pattern of development credits and we are going to introduce development credits to ensure that that crucial stage in the development of a programme is properly recognised.'

Cohen’s initiative, though admirable, could have been timed better coming as it does alongside an announcement by director of news and current affairs, James Harding, that the BBC was to axe 75 posts in its news division.

In a cheerless memo to staff, he said the job losses would 'add to uncertainty after what has been a trying year.'

He said: 'I also appreciate the concern the cost savings come at a time that so many people are working hard to make the most of new technologies and striving to deliver the best journalism in the world.

'The reality is that we have to live within the terms of the licence fee settlement.'
