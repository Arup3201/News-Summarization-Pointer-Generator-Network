The last Boston bombing victim still in the hospital has finally been discharged - exactly 100 days after the devastating blast left him needing 49 surgical procedures.

Marc Fucarile grinned as he left Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital on crutches on Wednesday morning with his fiancee and their son, while doctors and therapists gathered to say goodbye.

The 34-year-old roofer lost his right leg, broke his left, suffered severe burns and still has shrapnel lodged near his heart after the second of two bombs exploded near him on April 15.

He spent 45 days at Massachusetts General Hospital before transferring to 
Spaulding for 55 
days. He has gone to the operating room 16 times, where he has undergone 49 surgical procedures.

Relief: Marc Fucarile, followed by his fiancee and their son, left hospital on Wednesday - 100 days after the bombs detonated in Boston, claiming one of his legs and leaving him with shrapnel near his heart

Strength: He used crutches as he spoke to the media with his fiancee Jen and their son Gavin

But despite his immense battle and life-changing injuries, he was upbeat as he left the hospital.

'What's the first thing I'm looking forward to doing? Just sit down because my foot's hurting,' he joked as he spoke to the press before he left on Wednesday.

'Just to be with my boy,' he added. 'I know I have the rest of my life - thank you to the people that were there that day. I'd go through 100 more procedures just to be able to go home with him.'

His fiancée, Jen Regan, said she was looking forward to having him back home after everything they've missed together.

'Just
 the simple things you brush aside, like family dinners,' he said. 'Gavin hasn't 
had his dad home for dinner in 100 days. Movie nights, cuddling… I'm 
excited, it's really good.'

Grateful: Speaking before he left, he thanked those who saved his life on the day of the bombings

Joy: He said he was looking forward to being home for his son, Gavin, whom he is seen touching on the head

Road to recovery: He sits with his fiancee back at his home as he shows his amputated leg

Fucarile still faces further procedures but has been undergoing physical therapy to strengthen his arms, and was able to leave the hospital on crutches.

'Just because I’m going home today, 
by no means is that road over,' Fucarile said. 'Boston, please do not 
forget about that day, or the people who need you.'

Mr Fucarile was watching a friend take part in the marathon with four boyhood buddies from Stoneham, Massachusetts when the bombs went off.

After the first 
bomb detonated, brothers Paul 
and J.P. Norden huddled with Jarrod Clowery, James 'Bim' Costello and Fucraile, not realizing they were inches away 
from the second device.

When it exploded, both brothers and Fucarile 
lost a leg, while Clowery suffered burns and shrapnel wounds and 
Costello was hospitalized with serious injuries.

Spaulding officials say Fucarile is the last person injured in the explosions to leave a hospital.

A firefighter rushed to put a tourniquet on his leg and he was taken to  hospital in a detainee van because no ambulance was
 immediately available.

In an interview with NBC News in May, he recalled how he pleaded with the firefighter.

Relief: He is finally returning to his son Gavin, left, and his fiance Jen, right, for the first time since April 15

Strong: Fucarile has undergone weeks of physical therapy at Spaulding and faces further procedures

'I'm like, 'I don't want to die,"' he recounted. '"I 
got a little boy and I got my fiancée. I don't want to die." 
He's like, "Just think of them. Just think of them. Keep them on your 
mind. Just hang in there".'

It wasn't until a week after the April 15 attack that Mr Fucarile opened his eyes for the first time.

He has been constantly surrounded by family - including his fiancée Jen Regan and their son Gavin - who have taken off whole weeks from work to be by his side.

Despite their support, Fucarile has previously said his injuries kept him isolated.

In
 an interview from his hospital bed in May, Mr Fucarile said he 
struggles with anxiety and paranoia, aside from the physical pain.

Support: His step mother Andrea and father Edward, who have spent weeks in the hospital with him, are pictured after updating the media about his condition just a week after the blasts

Emotional: Jen is surrounded by relatives as she reads a statement at Massachusetts General Hospital in April detailing his injuries, including the amputation, broken leg, burns and shrapnel near his heart

He told the Globe: 'I haven’t really talked to anybody because I don’t want to say the wrong thing being on medication like I am. To heal all the wounds I have. It’s pretty crazy.'

His father, Ed Fucarile, was among those who attended the arraignment of bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on July 11, and wore a Boston Strong T-shirt with his son's name on it.

The suspect has pleaded not guilty to 30 counts - including killing four people - in connection to the bombings that he allegedly carried out with his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev.

Tamerlan was killed after a shootout with police in Watertown, Masachusettes on April 19, after their images were released to the public. Dzhokhar was captured later that day.
