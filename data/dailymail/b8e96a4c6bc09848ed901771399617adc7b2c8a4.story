The radical preacher accused of recruiting two Austrian teenage girls to join ISIS has now been blamed for a husband and wife taking their three young daughters to join the terror group.

Unemployed benefits claimant Ebu Tejma, 33, was arrested in Vienna in December over claims he is a terror mastermind who helped more than 160 local people join ISIS - including the young jihadi 'poster girls' Samra Kesinovic, 17, and Sabina Selimovic, 16.

It was alleged that he had targeted attractive young women in particular so they could become brides for the militants fighting under the Islamic State's chilling black banner.

Now Ebu Tejma, whose real name is Mirsad Omerovic, is accused of helping a family of five travel to Syria and join ISIS after relatives reported them missing shortly after the preacher's arrest.

Austrian police believe they have now established a link between Ebu Tejma, who remains in custody, and a local family of five who have disappeared and are believed to now be in Syria.

Self-employed carpenter Enes Skalic, 35, his wife Michaela, 36, and their three daughters Sarah, 11, Ajla, 9, and Enisa, 2, were reported missing by Michaela's sister after they disappeared from their home in the town of Bregenz in western Austria. 

Police believe the family may have joined the terrorist group Isis after uncovering the father's links to Islamic extremism.

According to local media, Skalic who has Bosnian roots is known to Austria's counter-terrorism agency, the BVT, for being part of a 'West Balkans fighter' circle which has links to Tejma.

Skalic's wife converted to Islam after they married and just before disappearing their middle daughter wrote an entry in her school diary in which she said she wanted to make a pilgrimage to Mecca and wear a headscarf. 

The family were described by local major Helmut Kriegel as 'very discreet' but were struggling to make a living and had put their house up for sale last autumn.

Interpol has now issued an international arrest warrant.

It is claimed they both later wanted to return home but one was killed and the other vanished

Ebu Tejma was arrested in December, with prosecutors claiming he had recruited hundreds of young people on behalf of the Islamic State terror group.

It was claimed that Ebu Tejma had specifically targeted middle class young women of Balkans origin like Kesinovic and Selimovic as prospective brides for the militants.

Kesinovic was just 16 and her friend Selimovic 15 when they vanished from their homes in Vienna in April last year. They later posted images of themselves online, showing them both in Syria branding Kalashnikov rifles, and in some cases surrounded by armed men.

It is though they first flew to the Turkish capital Ankara before travelling on to southern Turkey. Security officials believe there is a large network of ISIS activists operating in the south of the country helping would-be jihadis to cross into Syria along well-trodden smugglers routes.

In December, UN counter-terror officials said intelligence suggests that one of the girls is likely to have been killed, although it wasn't clear which one. The other girl is believed to have gone missing.

Vanished: The Austrian girls disappeared one day and just left notes to their parents in their bedrooms. 'Don't look for us, we have gone to fight in the holy war', they read

Security experts said that Tejma, 33, who lived with his pregnant wife and five children in a council provided flat in Vienna, specialised in targeting young women like Kesinovic and Selimovic.

He is accused of standing outside mosques asking men if they had daughters of marriageable age which could be provided to good young men as wives.

A security insider also said that ISIS was promising parents with daughters much better social security payments under ISIS than they would get if they remained in Austria.

The insider said that with anti-terror activists from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ebu Tejma not only recruited the two girls who became the public face of jihad, but was also involved in a further 166 defections of youngsters from Austria to fight for the Islamic State.

This is in addition to his alleged fundraising activities that provided a significant sum of money for the terrorists' coffers.
