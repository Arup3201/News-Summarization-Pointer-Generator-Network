The Duchess of Cornwall has welcomed home the latest troops to return from Afghanistan by awarding medals and greeting their families.

The 4th Battalion The Rifles arrived home from a six-month tour in Helmand province in October.

Today the troops, who trained Afghanistan's security forces, paraded around Salisbury town centre.

Colonel: The Duchess is Royal Colonel of the battalion since 2007 and takes her role very seriously. She visited them in January before deployment to bid them farewell

Camilla, the Battalion's Royal Colonel since 2007, was greeted at the Ward Barracks in Bulford, Wiltshire, by Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel Tom Bewick before watching the festivities.

Later, she gave a speech in the barracks' forecourt and awarded operational service medals to the soldiers.

Sarah Stirling, whose son is an officer with the battalion, met the Duchess after the parade.

Proud: The Duchess told the soldiers and families they made her proud to be British and listened intently to stories of their experience in Helmand province

Admiring: The Duchess was full of admiration as she stood back to watch the troops parade through the court into a line before handing them their medals of service

'The whole family is here today to watch this very special moment,' Mrs Stirling said.

'The Duchess was very friendly - a lovely lady. We really enjoyed talking to her. We feel extremely proud.'

Meanwhile, Camilla's husband Prince Charles is preparing to fly to South Africa to represent the Queen at Nelson Mandela's funeral.

It is not the first time she has awarded troops from this battalion medals. In 2011, the Duchess honoured soldiers from the seat of a mobility scooter

Conversation: The Duchess spoke to each serviceman before pinning an Operational Services Medal on their uniform

The
 Duchess, who will not accompany her husband, spent today speaking to 
children and parents of the troops about the long-awaited return, and 
hearing from the soldiers about their journey.

She visited the troops before their deployment in January to watch their training.

Greetings: After, the Duchess stops to chat with Sgt Bill Jowah and his six-year-old son, Bill, to hear about the experience and how it feels to be home

She was taken around the training ground in a Husky-armoured vehicle and given a briefing on what they expected to achieve in Afghanistan.

In 2011 she led a medal-giving ceremony at the Bulford barracks from the seat of a mobility scooter having fractured her leg weeks before on a walk in Balmoral.

The Duke of Edinburgh is the Colonel-in-Chief of the Regiment whilst each battalion has its own Royal Colonel, which include The Duke of Kent, The Earl of Wessex, Princess Alexandra, The Countess of Wessex, The Duke of Gloucester and The Duchess of Gloucester.
