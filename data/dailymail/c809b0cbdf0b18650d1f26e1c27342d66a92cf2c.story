Victor Dubuisson insists he’s ‘just a normal person’. When pressed about his life he says ‘I’m just… nothing special, you know’.

Let’s reappraise that modest statement. He is a normal person, but one with an outside chance of winning The Open at on Sunday. And, despite his protestations, he is very special indeed.

Dubuisson gatecrashed the top of the leaderboard at Hoylake after a third round 68 left him in fifth, eight shots behind Rory McIlroy with 18 holes to play. But whether or not the fairytale victory comes, Dubuisson is set for a year to remember.

Talent: France's Victor Dubuisson is now a near-certainty to qualify for Europe's Ryder Cup team

The 24-year-old from Cannes has now announced his talent to the world. A former amateur No 1, Dubuisson’s first big victory came over Tiger Woods and a quality field in Turkey last November, and his short-game magic mesmerised in the final of the WGC Accenture Match Play in February.

Dubuisson is now proving he can challenge at major championships and is now a near-certainty to qualify for Europe’s Ryder Cup team at Gleneagles.

But, first things first, can he lift the Claret Jug today?

‘I’ll just try to do my best,’ he says. ‘If the putts go in, it can be a good day.’

Battle: Jimmy Walker and Victor Dubuisson can expect to go head-to-head at Gleneagles

He says he can handle the pressure on the biggest stages, whether at Hoylake or in Perthshire this autumn. ‘If the crowd is big, it’s not really a big difference,’ he claims. ‘I really focus on my game on the course.’

As chance would have it, Dubuisson played alongside Jimmy Walker, who is nailed-on to be a rookie on the American team in September.

Walker had a flying start, but no birdies in his closing 13 holes mean the 35-year-old Oklahoman is out of the running.

‘I’m pretty bummed about the way the round finished,’ he admitted.

Disappointment: Adam Scott slid down the leaderboard after a birdieless front nine on Saturday

He has formed the basis of a friendship with his European counterpart over the past few weeks, having played together at the US Open. ‘Victor’s a nice guy, he’s quiet, I enjoy playing with him,’ said Walker.

Of course, that will be forgotten in the maelstrom of intercontinental matchplay, as Walker coldly insists: ‘I’m confident taking anybody on.’

Adam Scott, their playing partner, slid down the leaderboard after a birdie-less front nine and looked disconsolate after a double bogey on the 10th.

But a birdie on the 11th and four more on the back nine lifted the spirits. Scott needs a miracle but is still fighting at six under par.

Dubuisson, at eight under par, still has hopes of a maiden major. This small battle has been won by Europe, but there are plenty more in store at Gleneagles.
