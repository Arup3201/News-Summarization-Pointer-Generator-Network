Most men enjoy a good pint of lager or real ale while they are watching football or relaxing with friends.

Very few would dedicate themselves for more than two decades to the world's longest pub crawl.

But six friends from the West Midlands have embarked on a special quest to drink in a different pub every Saturday night - and have done so for 28 years.

Peter Hill, 56, his father John Hill, 81, John Drew, 48, Kelvin Price, 34, Richard Hill, 30, and Gary Mountain, 54, make up the Black Country Ale Tairsters (BATs) and have been to a total of 16,337 pubs, hotels and wine bars.

Living the dream: BATs have visited a new pub every Saturday night for 28 years, they've been to more than 16,000

Originally a team of 20 when it started in 1984, the BATs have now slimmed down to half a dozen men on a serious mission.

They have vowed to visit very single pub in the West Midlands even going as far as fashioning a rather fetching uniform out of beer towels.

While it may seem as simple as walking into a pub and ordering a pint, there’s a strict science behind holding the longest bar crawl world record, as organiser of the group Peter, from West Bromwich explains.

Stylish: They group were so dedicated that they decided to make their own uniform fashioned out of beer towels

He said: 'We have our own score cards which we fill in and give to the pub we go to.

'We write the number of the pub on the card, and ask the landlord to sign the book we have which has information in from every pub we go to.

'We also keep a record of the pubs we go to by taking a photo of the pub, inside and out and make a note of anything special about the place.'The men believe they hold the title for the world’s longest pub crawl, and have kept thousands of souvenirs to prove it.

Including 130 box files full of beer mats and menus and 35,000 photos.

Stamp of approval: The BATs legendary commitment has turned them into real ale connoisseurs

Lads: Peter, John and Kelvin are three of six that make up the mighty Black Country Ale Tairsters - there used to 20 members when the club was founded in 1984

Every pub they visit is rated, photos are taken and information is noted down and BATs approval is a recognised accolade in the local pub trade.  

Their almost obsessive hobby demands a certain amount of patience from their partners who sometimes accompany them to the pub - but are strictly banned from the BATs regular four-day boozy weekends away.

Girlfriend Crystal Tromans, 24, from Tipton, West Midlands, spoke of her six year relationship with Kelvin Price. 

She said: 'When I started going out with Kelvin, it was clear from the start that beer was part of the package.

'They have done it for so long, you know what you’re getting into - you can’t complain.

'He enjoys his hobby and he lets me do what I want to do, plus it’s nice to get some time to myself!

'I do sometimes go to the pub with him on a weekend if they’re meeting nearby, as some of the other partners do but we’re not allowed to go on the lads’ weekends - that’s definitely more of a man thing!

'When we go away I can’t keep him away from new pubs and breweries - he’s always trying to hunt out some real ale.

'Kelvin wants me to learn to drive so that I can ferry him about on his pub trips - good try.'

Dedication: The BATs keep a detailed log of pubs they have visited - their approval has become something of an accolade in the local pub trade

The BATs raise money for childrens’ hospitals along their way by asking each pub landlord they buy beer from to donate £1 to a deserving cause, so far raising over £15,000.

They have also made trips to pubs right across Europe but they say these pubs don't count because they are not in the UK.

The Tame Bridge public house in Great Bridge, West Bromwich, West Midlands is one of the team’s favourite local pubs.

Local: The BATs allow their wives and girlfriends to come for a drink in the week but they are strictly banned from the boozy weekends away

Owner, David Parsons, 67, said: 'These men are incredible - they are such a presence in the pub here.

'They have changed this pub, we used to serve a lot of lager but since they started coming with the knowledge they have of real ales, we sell a lot of the stuff.

'We get a different crowd in here now, and I love being educated about what they know about real ale.

Calling card: The group invested in personalised beer mats - which they leave in every pub they visit

Pub number 15,440! The Old Moseley Arms in Birmingham - the BATs have visited 16,337 and have vowed to drink in every pub in the West Midlands

'What they don’t know about beer, no-one does!

'I don’t think their quest will ever end, they will always find new territories when it comes to beer.'

The BATs latest quest is to have been to every pub in the Midlands by the end of 2014.

Sunshine: The Bats were lucky to have a good weather when they visited pub number 15,499 The Paddock, Penally

Rain: The boys endured summer showers to visit pub number 15,520 - The Cresselly Arms, Pembrokeshire

Historical: Pub number 15,491 The Charlton, Pembroke Dock, looks staunchly traditional from the outside

Peter added: 'It’s great to have made it to many milestones, and exciting to think of what we have to come.

'It’s hard to think of a hobby which is so much fun.

'When we’ve finished our current quest, we will just move on to another county. I’ll be doing this for as long as I can - I intend to visit every pub I can.'

Beer there and everywhere: BAT member Peter Hill has even written a book about his many experiences
