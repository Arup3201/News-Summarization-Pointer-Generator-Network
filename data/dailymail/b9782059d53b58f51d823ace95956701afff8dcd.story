A fraternity at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee is being investigated on suspicion of giving girls 'date rape' drugs at a party.

Three women and a man were hospitalized and suffered black-outs after a Tau Kappa Epsilon party last Friday.

Reports claim members of the fraternity had drawn red Xs on the hospitalized girls' hands - and the man who was treated had sipped from one of their drinks.

Probe: Tau Kappa Epsilon has been suspended by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee after a party at the fraternity's residence (pictured) where three girls and a man are believed to have consumed Rohypnol

The group, which was investigated over sexual assault claims last year, has now been suspended by the university as police search the frat house for drugs that cause memory loss 'and other intoxicating effects'.

One of the girls who went to the hospital told officers 'she had a weird feeling and sensation prior to blacking out which she had never felt before,' according to the warrant read by CNN.

It continued: '[The student] stated she feels victimized by TKE and that she is sure some sort of drug or other intoxicant was given to her against her will and unbeknownst to her.'

According to the student, the fraternity had a reputation for putting 'roofies' - or, Rohypnol - into women's drinks but 'she thought it was all in the past'. 

Another hospitalized girl said 'you have to be hot' to get an $8 access card from the fraternity leaders which warrants free drinks.

A third told police someone poured her a drink then moved 'the cup under the bar out of sight; after a few moments the male pulled the cup back on top of the bar and gave her the mixed drink.'

Just over 30 minutes later, she blacked out. 

Rohypnol, a tasteless drug, is colloquially referred to as 'the date rape drug' as it sedates users who then fail to remember what happened during the time that they were under the influence.

Police said students could barely stand or walk when they visited the residence three times between midnight and 1.30am on Saturday 13. 

Warrant: Police are now searching the residence for drugs that cause 'memory loss' following the party 

They found 42 people under the age of 21 in the basement with either red or black Xs marked on their hands, CNN reported. The fraternity refused to explain what the Xs or colours signified.

The university suspended the fraternity while the investigation is under way, said Tom Luljak, vice chancellor of university relations and communications.

'We are deeply concerned about these allegations because the safety of our students is our number one priority,' he said. 

'Our police are aggressively pursuing this investigation to determine exactly what happened and who may have been involved.'

The university noted that no sexual assaults were reported in connection with the party.

Alex Baker of the Tau Kappa Epsilon International Fraternity said: 'These alleged actions do not align with our values of love, charity and esteem.

'We have temporarily suspended the Zeta-Zeta chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon. We are currently working with university officials and local authorities to ascertain all of the information of the incident.'
