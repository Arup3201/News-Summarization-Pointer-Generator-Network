Furious: Transsexual Katrina Harte, 50, of North Shields, has accused North Tyneside Council of discrimination after a worker refused to believe that she is a women

A transsexual has accused a council of discrimination after a member of staff wouldn't accept payment for a parking fine - because the worker wouldn't believe she was a woman.

Katrina Harte has complained to North Tyneside Council after the worker told her that she was a man and not the owner of the car at fault.

The 50-year-old, who underwent an NHS-funded sex change operation and put herself in £4,000 of debt paying for breast enlargement surgery, said: 'I was furious, I burst into tears.'

'Aren't they supposed to have a policy where they don't discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual people?

'I lodged a complaint there and then.'

North Tyneside Council is refusing to discipline the worker involved as they say she never meant any deliberate offence.

Katrina's car was caught on camera back in October as she parked for a few moments in a bus stop in North Shields. North Tyneside.

Because she had been doing a friend a favour, Katrina, who is awaiting a tracheal shave to remove her Adam's apple, contested the ticket with the council by filling out a mitigation form.

But she was ordered to pay the fine anyway so phoned the authority's parking control department.

She said: 'A woman answered and I gave her my name and address.

'Then she said she couldn’t accept my payment because the car is registered to a female and I’m clearly a man.

'It was like a smack in the face and I burst out crying.

'She apologised when I put her right, but the damage was done and she should never have said those words.

'I’ve had letters from North Tyneside Council telling me they won’t be taking disciplinary action because the words weren’t intentional, but that’s not the point.

'I want a full apology from them.'

Katrina, who has three children from her previous life as a man, says the upsetting incident demonstrates just how essential it is that she has the tracheal shave.

Apology: North Tyneside Council has apologised for the incident involving Ms Harte but says it will take no disciplinary action against the member of staff as no intentional offence was caused

However, health bosses last year refused to bankroll the surgery, saying it is considered to be a cosmetic procedure.

The former engineer had planned to save up the £2,000 needed to pay for the op privately, but is struggling to save the cash.

A spokesman for North Tyneside Council said: 'Good customer service and equality matters are both taken very seriously by North Tyneside Council.

'We are disappointed that Ms Harte feels these standards have not been met and we again reiterate our sincerest apologies, as already expressed to her on this matter, both by individuals concerned and through our formal complaints procedure.

'Our in depth investigations into the incident, through the corporate complaints process, have confirmed that a member of staff made a genuine error with no intention to cause any distress.'
