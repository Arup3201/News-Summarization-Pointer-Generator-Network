Britain’s North-South divide even applies to the rate of climate change, new research shows.

Scientists have discovered that the climate in the South of Britain is warming much more quickly than that in the North of the country in summer.

However, winter temperatures are increasing more quickly in the North.

The hottest five per cent of summer days in the UK have become hotter since 1950. The greatest increases in temperatures have been in the South. Summer temperatures in the North have not risen as quickly

The researchers also discovered that some of the hottest days and coldest nights in parts of Europe have warmed more than four times the global average since 1950.

The new paper by researchers at the University of Warwick and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, revealed that the hottest five per cent of days in summer have warmed fastest in a band from southern England and northern France to Denmark.

In this band, the hottest five per cent of days have got hotter by more than 2°C in many places.

By contrast, the average and slightly hotter than average days have warmed most in regions further south in France and Germany.

In eastern Spain and central Italy there has been broad warming across all types of days, but in most places those days which are cooler than average have not warmed so much.

Most regions of Europe have seen little change in the temperatures of the coolest summer days although in eastern Spain and central Italy these days have warmed along with all other types of summer days.

Image estimates changes in daytime summer temperatures that have occurred over a 43 year period. Plot A shows the change in the five per cent of hottest summer days. Plot C is the change in the average temperature. Plot E
shows the change in the five per cent of coolest summer days

Average temperature days in these regions of eastern Spain and central Italy have warmed by more than 2°C in many locations.

The results show little warming in summer daytime temperatures for most locations in Norway and Sweden, for all types of summer days – hot, average and cool.

In Europe, the coldest five per cent of winter nights have warmed most in eastern France, western Germany and Belgium where changes of more than two or even 2.5°C are not uncommon.

The coldest five per cent of winter days have not changed as much in these regions but in northern Italy and the Balkans changes of over 1.5 or 2°C are seen in the data.

In Spain and much of Italy there has been little change in winter night time temperatures of all types – warm, average and cool.

In Norway and Sweden many regions have seen large changes in winter night time temperatures for average and colder than average nights.

Warmer than average nights in this region have warmed less.

In the United Kingdom the frequency of nights which fall below zero has decreased most substantially in the north east where reductions of at least 10 per cent are seen in the observations for some locations.

The researchers translated observations of weather into observations of climate change using a gridded dataset of observations stretching back to 1950.

The paper points out that some locations and temperature thresholds have seen little change since 1950. 

The authors suggest that the results highlight the scale of the difference between global change and the local climate changes felt by individuals.

Dr David Stainforth, the lead author of the paper, said: ‘Climate is fundamentally the distributions of weather.

‘As climate changes, the distributions change. But they don’t just shift, they change shape.

‘How they change shape depends on where you are.

‘In Britain, climate change will feel very different if you live in Northumbria to if you live in Oxfordshire - different again in Devon.’

He added: ‘Our results also illustrate that the international goal of limiting the increase in global average temperature to 2°C would involve far greater changes for some places and for some aspects of climate, and therefore for particular individuals, communities and industries.’

Professor Sandra Chapman of the 
University of Warwick said: ‘It is common to discuss climate change in 
terms of changes in global average temperatures but these can be far 
from people’s perceptions of climate change.

Image estimates changes in night-time winter temperatures over a 43 year period. In the UK, the largest changes can be seen in Plot E which shows the very coldest five per cent of winter days. These have warmed by more than 1.5 degrees, with these changes focused mainly in the North East

‘The results in this paper begin to provide a picture of how local climate has been changing across Europe. It is a picture which is closer to that experienced by individuals.’

Dr Stainforth concluded: ‘Changes in local climate pose challenges for decision makers across society not just when preparing for the climate of the future but even when planning for the climate of today.

‘We need to design buildings so that they don’t overheat, decide which are the best crops to plant, and even plan for variations in large scale productivity.

‘These would all benefit from knowledge of how the climate distribution has changed at particular locations. This work begins to provide such information.’

In the South the hottest 5% of days have got up to 2°C hotter

In the North, the hottest days are not getting hotter so quickly

@highlight

In northern areas the number of nights during which temperatures fall below
 zero has decreased most substantially - by at least 10%
