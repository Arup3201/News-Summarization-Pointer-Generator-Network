Five people have been killed and thousands have fled their homes as terrifying floods hit cities in Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic.

Officials across central Europe issued disaster warnings and scrambled to reinforce flood defences today as rivers swelled by days of heavy rain threatened to burst their banks.

Nine people are also missing in the extreme conditions as offices, schools and homes are all left deserted or completely under water. The historic city of Prague in the Czech Republic is on high alert and the zoo has been evacuated.

The Danube in the southeast German city of Passau is expected to rise to its highest level in 70 years today and a spokesman for the city's crisis centre said the situation has become 'extremely dramatic'.

In Prague, almost 2,700 people have been evacuated from low-lying areas as the country sees its worst flooding in a decade.

The historic centre is under threat from the rising water and metal walls are being erected in an attempt to keep them at bay. 

Animals at the city's zoo have been moved to higher ground. Keepers had to tranquilise tigers in order to safely move them.

The zoo is situated on the bank of the river Vltava and in 2002 134 animals were killed during the worst floods the city has ever seen.

More than 1,000 animals were evacuated when the water rose by 10 metres.

Czech police said this weekend at least five people had died in this spate of flooding. Firefighters evacuated homes in western regions and in villages outside the capital today and yesterday, rescuing 200 people.

Czech officials said the waters of the
 Vltava river could reach critical levels in Prague and that special 
metal walls were being erected to prevent flooding.

The Charles Bridge - normally packed with tourists at this time of year - was closed to the public as were some other popular spots near the river at the foot of Prague Castle.

billions of dollars of damage in the Czech Republic.

declared a state of emergency for most of the nation on Sunday and 
pledged 300 million crowns ($15.11million) for relief efforts.

barriers in place in Prague and volunteers helped pile up sandbags in 
areas popular with tourists in the ancient centre. The landmark Charles 
Bridge was closed and workers evacuated parts of Prague zoo.

Levels on the Vltava river that cuts through Prague's centre continued to rise today.

Earlier, a woman was killed in the same town after a summer cottage collapsed in the raging water.
