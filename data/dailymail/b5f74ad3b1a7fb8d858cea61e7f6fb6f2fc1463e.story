Detroit Red Wings star Darren Helm was looking to get a little sleep on Sunday night after an impressive overtime win by his team.

That was not to be however, as shortly after midnight his girlfriend, Devon Englot, informed him that she was in labor.

And this was a quick delivery, so quick in fact that the two did not make it to the hospital in time and Helm had to step up and deliver his daughter Rylee in the back of his car.

The Red Wings report that Helm started gathering their things when he got the news that the baby was coming, phoning the hospital from his home as he loaded the car. 

Englot however, who is also the mother of another child, the couple's 3-year-old daughter Reece, started to feel things moving a little too fast.

'Devon kept on saying that she had the urge to push,' Helm said. 

And Helm realized what that meant. 

'They said when the baby’s ready, the baby’s ready. She can’t really control much about it. We tried to make it there. She tried to hold her back,' he said.

'They’ve always told us the second one comes quicker, but we didn’t expect it to be that quick.'

Mom, dad and big sister are all doing fine now

The couple were a mile away from the Providence Park Hospital in Novi, Michigan, when Helm got in the backseat and delivered their baby. 

'It came on so quick. We thought we had lots of time to get to the hospital and things just took a turn and the baby was ready to come out to say hello and that’s what she did,' he explained.

Five minutes later, they were back on their way to the hospital with their new passenger.

'We got to the ER and they kept assuring us that things were going to be OK after they got a good look at the baby and Devon was feeling good,' said Helm. 

'After that things slowly calmed down. It took us awhile to kind of get over what happened, but things are moving along pretty well.'
