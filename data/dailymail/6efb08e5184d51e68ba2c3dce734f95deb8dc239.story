When widowed Jean Bailey moved into a new home, she set about transforming  a boggy wasteland into a pretty garden with a pond, shrubs and flowers.

It soon became a haven for wildlife, populated by frogs, newts, birds and insect life.

The labour of love took several years and cost the best part of £10,000, but was worth every penny to Mrs Bailey, 74, who looked on it as a memorial to her husband, a keen gardener, who had died of cancer.

Devastated: Jean Bailey  breached greenbelt planning regulations when she created her landscape garden

Nature: The garden is home to fish, frogs, newts, birds, insects and a variety of plant life

Determined: The grandmother said she would rather go to prison then lose her 'pride and joy'

Now she is facing heartbreak, as 
council officials have ordered her to tear up the garden, and return 
part of it to the muddy state she found it in.

Ironically, their reason is that she has developed part of the garden on greenbelt land.

The work was done without planning 
permission and, say officials, it ‘erodes the character and quality of 
the area’ in Harriseahead, Staffordshire.

‘You must return the land to agricultural use and character, removing all garden paraphernalia,’ they have told her.

The retired florist has been warned 
that if she does not comply, council workmen will do the work and she 
will face a hefty bill.

Expense: The pensioner spent around £10,000 creating her 'pride and joy' in Harriseahead, Staffordshire

Extra: The land the garden was built on was bought by Mrs Bailey's daughter along with their house

Threats: The council have told Mrs Bailey she faces legal action unless the land is returned to 'agricultural use'

The issue dates back to 2006 when Mrs
 Bailey’s daughter and son-in-law bought the cottage and she moved into a
 granny flat extension.

As part of the deal, the sellers threw
 in an adjoining plot to create a bigger garden. Mrs Bailey said: ‘If I 
knew it was greenbelt land I would not have built on it.

‘But these greenbelt laws are there for a reason: to protect against big developments and  safeguard wildlife.

‘I’m protecting wildlife with my little pond and I’ve used up 10ft  of greenbelt land which was  an eyesore before.

Room with a view: A view of the field from Mrs Bailey's home before the landscape gardeners arrived on site

Costly: The council said it  will send its own workers to do the job and leave Mrs Bailey with the bill

'It’s really upset me. The garden reminds me of my husband, John, who died in 1994 – it acts as a memorial to him.

‘It is my pride and joy and I would rather go to prison than lose it.’

Councillor Eddie Boden, the cabinet 
member for planning at Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council, said: 
‘Planning requirements have to be obeyed.

‘No special circumstances exist to justify what has to be considered to be inappropriate development within the greenbelt.’

Bureaucracy: Letter sent to Mrs Bailey from the council, right, and the field before its was developed, left
