A footballer claims paying a £25,000 fine from his club for sleeping with Katie Price was worth it.

But Katie Price has strenuously denied the ex-footballer's claims.

She wrote on Twitter: 'Fernando is a beautiful man and it is devastating to hear of his illness.

'We both had a great night all those years ago but we did not have sex'.

Fernando Ricksen, who used to play for Rangers, claims he took the glamour model for a private dance with two strippers and then had sex with her at a hotel, the Sun reports.

The ex-Rangers player, who has recently revealed on Dutch TV that he has just five years to live after being diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease, wrote the confession in his new book.

He claimed: 'The sex was amazing - it was a once-in-a-lifetime I will never, ever forget.'

Katie Price, 35, who was known as 
Jordan at the time, hadn't got together with Peter Andre at the time and
 newly-single Ricksen, 37, wrote he was 'on the prowl' after splitting 
with his wife. 

The pair met at a party in Glasgow ten years ago when Katie sat on Ricksen's lap, he wrote.

He took her to a strip club before they spent the night at the £450-a night luxury hotel, he added.

Soon news reached his bosses and, as Ricksen writes, they were far from happy.

He
 said: 'I was all over the front pages and looking back shagging Jordan 
was only going to have one result but I took the club fine - happily.

'My night of passion with Jordan cost me £25,000 - it was worth every penny. '

Ricksen, who had been warned about his behaviour by the club before, says he was applauded by his teammates.

'They were cheering and yelling. The next thing I saw was the front page of the papers, they were waving them in the air.

'They were stuck on my locker. Everywhere.'

Ricksen, originally from Holland, writes about the encounter in his book Fighting Back: The Fernando Ricksen Story.

'I was having problems with my ex-wife Graciela and we'd split up. I was on the prowl again. That night I was damn proud of myself - banging Jordan was one hell of an achievement.'
