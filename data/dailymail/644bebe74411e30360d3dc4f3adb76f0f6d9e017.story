The mother of Aaron Hernandez's alleged victim left court sobbing on Thursday as the prosecutor's opening statement revealed details of her son's murder.

Ursula Ward later returned to court this afternoon as proceedings got underway in the former New England Patriot player's murder trial  in Fall River, Massachusetts.

Hernandez, dressed in a sharp, dark suit, stared straight ahead and rocked from side to side, chewing gum as images of his friend, Odin Lloyd, flashed on a screen in front of him. He has pleaded not guilty to the murder. 

Hernandez's fiancée and mother of his young daughter, Shayanna Jenkins, sat behind him in court alongside his brother DJ and mother Terri. Mrs Hernandez was also seen wiping tears away in the courtroom.

Miss Jenkins' sister Shaneah sat with the victim's mother and other friends who wept at details of Lloyd's death. Shaneah was Mr Lloyd's girlfriend at the time he was shot in the head and torso and dumped in a pit at an industrial park in June 2013.

Prosecutors said Hernandez and two friends, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, picked Lloyd up at his home in Boston on June 17, drove him to the industrial park and shot him dead.

Prosecutors have not said who pulled the trigger but said Hernandez orchestrated the killing. 

Ortiz and Wallace have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. 

In opening statements on Thursday, District Attorney Patrick Bomberg took jurors through what he said was the sequence of events that led to Lloyd's killing. 

He played before-and-after footage that Bomberg said showed Lloyd getting into a car driven by Hernandez, then video taken shortly afterward at the NFL player's home, without Lloyd in the car.

The prosecutor also presented an image taken off Hernandez's video surveillance system that showed Hernandez standing outside his basement, holding what Bomberg said was a gun.

As the prosecutor showed jurors a photo of Lloyd's body, his mother was overcome and had to leave the courtroom briefly.

He told the jury that Hernandez and his fiancée were the only people that Mr Lloyd knew in North Attleboro where his body was found.

He said Hernandez was unhappy with the victim, called up his friends and then contacted Lloyd using other people's phones before trying to conceal that he had done so. 

He then claimed that Hernandez 'drove the victim to a secluded area and participated in killing and covered up the killing'.

The jury was shown a photograph of Odin Lloyd's body which was found by a high school student jogging home on June 17, 2013 in North Attleboro, Massachusetts

The prosecutor also said that a blunt - a marijuana cigarette - was found at the scene of Lloyd's body which had Hernandez's DNA on it. 

Defense lawyer, Michael Fee, began his remarks on Thursday just before 1pm, announcing: 'Aaron Hernandez is an innocent man.'

The attorney said that Hernandez had been targeted by police and prosecutors in a 'sloppy' investigation because he was a celebrity and a Patriots player.

'Aaron never had a chance' Fee said. 'They locked on Aaron and they targeted him.' 

He said the evidence would show that Hernandez did not kill Lloyd and did not ask anyone to do so. He said authorities could offer no motive for the killing.

'The investigation was sloppy and unprofessional. What about the facts that showed Aaron's innocence?' he said. 'The evidence will show that they were ignored.'

Fee admitted that Hernandez and Lloyd liked to smoke marijuana together and go out on the town to pick up girls. 

He claimed that friends were desperate to hang out with Hernandez because of his NFL status and how he picked up the tab and was so generous - often hiring cars for his friends to use.  

The defense attorney also claimed that two nights before his murder, Hernandez gave Lloyd the keys to a rental SUV after partying all night with two women. The keys were later found on Lloyd's body.

Fee claimed that the Pats player had contacted his friend Odin on the night of his death, only to see if he wanted to party - and not for any other reason.

Noting that Hernandez had long-term football contract, a new house, a fiancée and a seven-month-old baby, the defense attorney said: 'In June of 2013, Aaron Hernandez was planing a future, not a murder.'

Evidence that Hernandez was at the scene is not enough to convict him, Fee said.

'Mere presence is not enough. We can't be convicted of a crime just because we hang with the wrong people or are in the wrong place,' he told the jury.

On Thursday afternoon, the prosecution called Odin Lloyd's former employer who said Lloyd had failed to turn up for work on June 17 and the following day.

The employer said that he had called or texted Lloyd but received no response. Later that day, he learned that Lloyd, whom he employed at his fertilizer company, had died. 

The prosecution then called 17-year-old Matthew Kent to the stand. The high school student was the first to report finding Lloyd's body as he took a shortcut on his job home through a construction site.

The teen testified that Lloyd was lying on his back and did not respond when he twice asked if he was alright. The boy then ran to a nearby business for help where a man called 911.

The teen described the scene, saying that a red baseball hat was lying above the man's head and a white rag near his feet. 

Mr Kent also said that there were tire tracks for about 30 feet close to the body.

The prosecution then entered into exhibits two images of the victim's body, lying face up on the dirt. 

Hernandez often leaned forward in court, paying close attention to opening statements and witness testimony, including the account of Matthew Kent.

The swearing-in began on Thursday morning after some brief delays involving jury issues.

One juror was late getting to court, and another juror sent a note to the judge.  Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh then began individually questioning jurors. 

A jury of 13 women and five men was seated by Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh on Monday after more than two weeks of jury selection. 

Six of the 18 jurors were randomly selected as alternates just before deliberations started.

Garsh instructed jurors not to talk to anyone about the case or share details of the trial with anyone in any manner, including through social media. 

The murder trial gets underway just days before Hernandez's former team plays in the Super Bowl.

Sunday's Super Bowl will be the Patriots' first appearance since 2012, when Hernandez caught a touchdown pass in Super Bowl XLVI.

At the time he seemed to be a man with a bright future.  

At age 23, he had a Super Bowl appearance under his belt and a $40 million contract as a star tight end with the team. 

He and his fiancée had started a family and were living in a mansion in the Boston suburbs with their 8-month-old daughter. 

But at the opening of the trial, prosecutors have started to paint a different picture of Hernandez as a killer who orchestrated the shooting of semiprofessional football player Lloyd. 

At 23 Hernandez had a Super Bowl appearance under his belt and a $40 million contract as a star tight end with the New England Patriots, but then he was arrested in June 2013 and charged with murder

Hernandez was arrested on 26 June 2013, just days after Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found in an industrial park near his North Attleboro mansion. 

The Patriots cut him less than two hours after he was arrested. 

Prosecutors have listed Shayanna Jenkins as a possible witness and this month petitioned the court to grant immunity to her. That could compel her to testify. 

The court has not said whether it was granted. Thursday was the first day since the petition was heard that Jenkins appeared in the courtroom. 

Hernandez, now 25, has also been charged with killing two men in Boston in 2012 because he felt disrespected after one of them spilled a drink on him at a nightclub.

He pleaded not guilty after being charged in those shootings in May, and the case has not yet gone to trial.

Prosecutors have said Hernandez may have showed Lloyd the spot where a 2012 double homicide took place in Boston.

Prosecutors suggested Lloyd's knowledge of the 2012 killings was a possible motive in his slaying.

The judge has ruled that prosecutors will not be allowed to tell the jury about the 2012 Boston killings.
