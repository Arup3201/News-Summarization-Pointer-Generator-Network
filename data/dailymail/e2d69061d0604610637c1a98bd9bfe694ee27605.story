Ed Miliband was criticised last night for failing to stop a ‘petty and spiteful’ bid by Labour chiefs to sack veteran MP Ann Clwyd after she spoke out against the Labour-run Welsh health service.

Party officials secretly decided last week to force 75-year-old Ms Clwyd to take part in a ‘Labour beauty contest’ merely to win the right to stand at next year’s General Election in the South Wales seat she has held for 30 years.

The move follows Labour anger with Ms Clwyd for demanding reform to the NHS in Wales, controlled by the Labour-dominated Welsh Assembly. 

Ann Clwyd pictured with her husband Owen. He died in a Cardiff hospital in 2012, with Ms Clwyd claiming he was 'left to die like a battery hen' 

She claimed her husband was left ‘to die like a battery hen’ in a Cardiff hospital in 2012.

Ms Clwyd announced in February, following an illness, that she intended to stand down as Cynon Valley MP. Labour chiefs imposed an all-women shortlist, provoking fury in her local party which threatened to ‘go on strike’ and refuse to pick a successor.

After recovering from her illness, and being urged locally to stay on, Ms Clwyd said in July she had changed her mind and planned to carry on as an MP.

It was expected she would be allowed to contest her seat like other sitting MPs – without facing a challenge.

But Labour’s ruling national executive decided last week that she will have to enter an all-women selection contest – just like a novice candidate.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has been criticised for failing to stop Ms Clwyd for having to face a contest to merely win the right to stand at the next election 

A fellow MP said: ‘This has the hallmarks of a petty and spiteful act and it is hard to imagine it is not connected to Ann’s courageous stand on the NHS in Wales. 

'Senior figures are annoyed because they wanted the all-women shortlist to get a new young Labour woman candidate.’

Ms Clwyd said nurses showed ‘resentment, indifference and even contempt’ towards her husband Owen Roberts, who died of hospital-acquired pneumonia in 2012, aged 73.

But her calls to improve the Welsh NHS prompted a fierce counter-attack from her party.

Labour last night denied she was being punished, saying: ‘Everybody in Labour has great respect for Ann. 

'Nevertheless, established procedures dictate that the selection will go ahead as an all-women shortlist.’
