An Olympic hopeful rower repeatedly punched a high-flying City lawyer in a dancefloor brawl at a celebrity nightspot frequented by the likes of Prince Harry and Kate Moss, a court has heard.

Sean Corrigall, 23, is said to have hit commercial specialist lawyer Edward Dyson, 28, four times on the dancefloor at Mayfair cocktail bar Mahiki.

Mr Corrigall, of Sutton Green, Surrey, who was enjoying his first trip to a nightclub at the time of the alleged incident in March, denies assault and claims that Mr Dyson is exaggerating claims in order to put in a compensation claim.

Hammersmith Magistrates' Court heard 
Mr Dyson, an employee at Clifford Chance, claim that Corrigall and his 
three friends refused to move on the club's landing at 1am on March 31 
as he tried to make his way to the toilet.

He
 claimed that he managed to push his way past and added: 'They laughed 
at me, it was childish, nonsensical. They said something about my mother
 and I said: "Don't be so childish' and laughed at them.

'I went to the urinal and moments later someone threw a drink on my back.'

Mr
 Dyson, who strongly denied claims that he had taken drugs at the time, 
said that later a 'large gentleman' hit him on his left ear on the 
nightclub's dancefloor.

He 
said: 'It was with a fist, a punch. It clipped my jaw and hit my ear and
 he then went for my head and clipped my the right side of my jaw with a
 right-hand uppercut.

'I 
was hit four times, including the back of my neck and to the lower 
torso. If I had been hit in the teeth or nose I would have broken teeth 
and a broken nose.

'After the punches had been landed I was put in a headlock by the male and went down.'

Mr
 Dyson, 28, claims that he was left with a whiplash-type injury and says
 that the punches have worsened his pre-existing tinnitus - caused by a 
separate nightclub assault eight years earlier.

He said: 'It's worse than it ever was, it is just so loud now, like alarm bells and car horns constantly.

'There is no treatment for tinnitus. I have seen an esteemed consultant, but unfortunately there is nothing I can do.

'I have these noises, noises that are deafening and I cannot sleep again.'

'Is this not a precursor to a personal 
injury claim? It is all part and parcel of you trying to make a claim 
and show yourself as the victim and not the aggressor.'

But arguing tht Mr Dyson was the 
agressor, Mr Corrigal's lawyer claimed that the claims have been 
exageratted in order to win compensation.

Michael
 Stradling said: 'Is this not a precursor to a personal injury claim? It
 is all part and parcel of you trying to make a claim and show yourself 
as the victim and not the aggressor.

'You were aggressive for whatever reason, either through too much alcohol or some sort of substance abuse.

'You were recklessly aggressive and made violent attempts to butt Mr Corrigall.

'You
 went a little bit too far and you realised that and that is why you 
went to every effort to call the police to save your position, your 
status.'

Mr Dyson denied he
 was 'arrogant and aggressive' adding: 'This is a slight on my 
character. I have never taken any illegal substance and would never do 
so, my career is too important.

'In my life, my role, I have to be whiter than white.'

Corrigall
 told the court that Mr Dyson barged into his group aggressively and 
reacted angrily when the defendant suggested he should have simply said:
 'Excuse me.'

He added: 'He 
came towards me quite aggressively and attempted to bite me on the nose.
 I had to move back, quite dumbfounded, and he then tried to do it a 
second time.

'It was like a dog snapping, you could hear his teeth and one of my friends said he seemed highly intoxicated through drugs.'

Corrigall,
 who rows with Molesey Boat Club, said that he and a friend went to the 
toilet, where he says Mr Dyson deliberately barged into them, spilling 
the drink his friend was holding over all three of them.

'He
 said: "You don't know who you're f****** messing with. I own half of 
this nightclub and I'm going to get you c**** banned for life",' said Mr
 Corrigall.

He added that Mr
 Dyson complained to a club bouncer and Corrigall's friend was removed, 
prompting the defendant to seek him out on the dance floor, where he 
says the lawyer assaulted him.

He
 said: 'He struck me on my head with his head and then he lunged towards
 me with his head and struck the bottom of my cheek and I felt I had to 
restrain him with a headlock.'

The pair fell to the floor and 
Corrigall, who had consumed one cider and one beer during the night, 
told the court Mr Dyson said: 'I am going to sue you for everything 
you're worth.'

Mr Dyson conceded from the witness box: 'If you assault a solicitor it is not the best idea, because I will call the police.'

Staff were unwilling to call 999, but 
Mr Dyson, who staff pinned to the wall at one point, did and officers 
arrested Corrigall outside after he was wrestled to the floor.

Corrigall
 won has won four golds at the last two Scottish Indoor Rowing 
championships, where he broke his own national record last year, and won
 two golds at the Metropolitan and the Marlow Regatta and the gold cup 
for the 2,000 metres at the Henley Town Regatta.

Orkney councillors gave Mr Corrigal the money for a custom-made boat, which he launched on the model boat lake on Saturday.

The rower had been unable to reach his full potential with standard sports equipment.

He has offered to work with schools in Orkney to promote sport and healthy living.

The trial continues.
