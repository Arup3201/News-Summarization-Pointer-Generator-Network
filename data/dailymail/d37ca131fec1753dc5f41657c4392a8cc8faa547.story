New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo beat Mayor Michael Bloomberg in a whitewater rafting race on Monday down the Indian River in the Adirondacks.

The governor's office said his team beat the mayor's by 18 seconds, running the course in 18 minutes, 31 seconds to 18:49 for Bloomberg's raft.

Cuomo and Bloomberg, both wearing shorts and t-shirts, emerged from their rafts soaking wet after the race, which was held on the second day of Cuomo's inaugural 'Adirondack Challenge' - a publicity event that cost taxpayers $175,000.

Cuomo and a host of other state and 
local officials and business leaders participated in paddling events 
starting Sunday in the Hamilton County village. Cuomo said the event was
designed to draw attention to the recreational opportunities in the 
Adirondacks and to boost tourism.

On Sunday, the Governor's Invitational whitewater race packed 25 rafts with state officials and members of the media. The governor's team also won that competition, beating state Senate and Assembly teams.

Sunday's activities included flatwater paddling races on Indian Lake and a festival in a village park showcasing Adirondack brewers, winemakers, distillers and food producers.

Also on Monday, Cuomo said that state will begin airing a TV ad Tuesday to promote recreation in the Adirondacks and the North Country.

Cuomo admitted to reporters that the 'Adirondack Challenge' was a publicity stunt.

'Yeah, that's what it is,' Cuomo said, according to the Adirondack Daily Enterprise. 'But that's what we needed. We needed to get people to see it and enjoy it. It's the exposure through the media.

'You're not going to get thousands of people to drive up on one day to a rafting race. But you can have a race that exposes the area to 50 million tourists in New York City. We have to just get part of that market north.'

Unlike Cuomo, who sat at the front of his raft, Bloomberg chose to sit in the middle
