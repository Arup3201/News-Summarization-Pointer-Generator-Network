As excuses for bad performance go, it's up there with the classics.

But whether it will be enough to satisfy one of the world's most notorious dictators is another matter.

North Korean coach Kwang Min Kim last night blamed the defeat of his women's World Cup soccer team by the United States on fact that five of his players were struck by lightning.

He claimed some of them were hospitalised with electrocution after a training match almost three weeks earlier.

And Kim has all the more reason to come up with a convincing excuse - his men's team counterpart was sentenced to hard labour after he came home from the 2010 World Cup having lost all three games.

Jong-Il was then particularly displeased with a 7-0 thrashing by Portugal.

But Kim told a press conference after the game last night: 'When we stayed in Pyongyang during 
training our players were hit by lightning, and more than five of them 
were hospitalised.'

'Some
stayed in hospital and then came to Germany later than the rest of us.

'The goalkeeper and the four defenders were most affected, and some 
midfielders as well. The physicians said the players were not capable of
participating in the tournament.

'But
World Cup football is the most important and significant event for a 
footballer, so they don’t want to think about anything but football.

'The fact that they played could be called abnormal, the result of very strong will.'

Lauren Cheney and Rachel Buehler scored in the second half of the match to secure victory in their opening World Cup game.

Cheney scored in the 54th minute, taking a long cross from Abby Wambach right in front of the box and nodding the ball past goalkeeper Hong Myong Hui to set off a raucous celebration by the two-time World Cup champions.

Buehler hit the second goal of her career with a  strike from 11 yards in the 76th minute. Hong dived, but the ball rolled beneath her outstretched hand.

When the final whistle sounded, the U.S. reserves ran onto the field to celebrate while the North Koreans stood just beyond midfield, watching. It was the fourth straight time the teams had met in group play at the World Cup, and the Americans have won all but one of the games.Still, the victory isn't likely to end the questions about the Americans, who have been uncharacteristically inconsistent lately. After going more than two years without a loss, they dropped three games in five months, and looked decidedly unsettled against the North Koreans for much of the first half.

'It's always good going forward,' U.S. coach Pia Sundhage said. 'Two great goals, and we're moving on.'

The Korean outfit already have a 
mountain to climb in Group C, grouped with hotly-tipped Sweden as well 
as the USA and Columbia.

They are also the youngest team in the 
tournament with only two of their squad boasting World Cup experience, 
and just five have made more than 10 appearances with the senior 
national team.
