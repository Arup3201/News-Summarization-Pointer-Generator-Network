Would your marriage work better if you lived separately?

Claire and David Burke, a married couple from from West Yorkshire, argue yes. They've been together 14 years and never lived under the same roof.

The perks (they say) you too could have if you live separately from your spouse: You don't take each other for granted, you spend more quality time together rather than drift off to different parts of the house to text, read or watch telly and you have better sex because it's easier to see each other as sexual beings when you're not over-familiar.

It has been argued that by living in a separate house to your partner could mean you make an effort spend quality time together and don't become over-familiar

There isn't a long-term couple alive who won't deny there's a part of them that stirs and thinks 'Hmm. That could work!'

A part of him thinks 'Brilliant! I could invite my mates over whenever I fancied it, drink on Monday nights, watch porn 24/7 in my pants and vest, sleep in late, eat crap without being lectured about my high cholesterol, never make the bed or do the dishes.'

A part of her thinks 'Brilliant! No more picking up his sodding socks, pretending to like his mates and that I don't know that 'catching up on emails' in the office at 10pm means he's watching porn. I'd have more time to read and I bet I'd stick to that 5:2 diet if I didn't have to watch him scoff bangers and mash when I'm starving.'

Of course, when most men think it through, they realise not only would they be living in a pigsty, they'd closely resemble a bleary, bloated pig with any motivation for anything simply sliding under the sofa and seeping into the floorboards, lost forever.

She soon realises the 5:2 diet is even more dreary when there's no-one around to see how good you're being, that she actually quite likes the 'crap' TV he 'makes' her watch and doesn't really relish having that needy, clingy girlfriend who stays away because 'the man of the house' wouldn't want her dropping in announced, permanently parked on the sofa.

There are huge sexist, generalisations there but I'd suggest women do motivate men and lots of men provide a sensible sounding board for our insecurities.

Well-matched couples provide the 'yin' to each other's 'yang' regardless of which sex plays the traditional 'female' role of nurturer or fulfils the logical 'male' relationship function.

Quite apart from the fact that most couples couldn't afford to maintain two homes, most couples choose to marry and live together because it works. It's a balancing act.

You give each other kicks up the bum when you need it. Dispense cuddles and soup and sympathy when it's TLC that's required.

Tracey says that well matched couples balance one another out in the home

Independence is healthy in relationships but commitment and intimacy are higher on the list.

If your partner's sick, are you going to feel comfortable waving goodbye and jumping in your car to go 'home' when they're feverish and talking in tongues?

What about when you're both old and doddery and something as simple as having a shower becomes risky?

Living together might just save your lives.

Yes it's tough sharing your life and your space - especially at the start.

Everyone thinks it's all going to be lovey-dovey and you can't wait for them to arrive and then the moving van pulls up and all their stuff is plonked in your living room and everywhere you go and turn, they're there and instead of it being romantic you feel like an animal that's been cornered and trapped.

Those first few weeks and months are hell, even for compatible couples, because it's absolutely true that it's not until you live with someone that you truly know them.

We're weird creatures, human beings - we all have our little secrets that no-one really should see.

Fishing the half-eaten chocolate bar out of the bin, drunk at 2am, and polishing it off. Sitting on the sofa picking our toe-nails and lining up the bits on the coffee table.

Things that make you go 'Ewwww' are in abundance at the start.

But then so are the endearing things.

The super-confident career girl who can't sleep without her teddy. Him reaching his foot out to touch yours in the middle of the night 'just to check you're there'.

Is there anything nicer than snuggling up to someone you love on a cold winter's night or waking up from a heart-stopping nightmare to someone cuddling you and telling you 'It's OK, it's just a dream'?

If you don't live together, you not only don't develop the skills to negotiate challenges, I'd suggest you don't actually know each other.

Don't get me wrong, I've had plenty of relationships where the thought of living apart was mighty appealing and plenty of circumstances (working day and night) when it felt necessary.

But now I'm with the right person, a home without him in it would feel cold, lonely and soulless.

A major study recently revealed that the two key factors to long-term couple happiness were kindness and generosity.

You need buckets of both to make living together work but if you're getting it back by the bucketload, isn't that rather a nice place to be?
