High life: Stuart Broad with girlfriend Bealey Mitchell

Playing cricket for England has made him a millionaire and given him the jetsetting lifestyle of an international sports star.

So critics may say it’s a bit rich that Stuart Broad has claimed those on minimum wage should ‘stay humble’.

The 28-year-old, who reportedly earns a basic salary of £700,000 a year, was forced to apologise last night after facing a public backlash for his ‘hypocritical’ and ‘arrogant’ comments.

Broad, currently in Australia with the England team preparing for next month’s World Cup, wrote on Twitter: ‘I’ve heard if you earn minimum wage in England you’re in the top 10% earners in the World. #stay #humble.’

The fast bowler, who was educated at Oakham School where fees for boarders are up to £30,000 a year, has since deleted the tweet. He apologised on the site, insisting the remark was meant to serve as a reminder to himself rather than an instruction to the public.

But the comment had already provoked the ire of fans, sports journalists, and charities, with several accusing him of being ignorant and out of touch.

Piers Morgan, who has been a social media cheerleader for ousted batsman Kevin Pietersen, wrote on Twitter: ‘Great irony of Stuart Broad’s comment is that he’s never stayed humble in his life. Makes KP [Kevin Pietersen] look like Mother Teresa in humility stakes.’

Sports journalist Owen Gibson tweeted: ‘Wonder if Stuart Broad has worked out how many humble Sky subscriptions or Ashes tickets you can afford on the minimum wage.’

A full-time employee working 40 hours a week on the UK minimum wage of £6.50 would have an annual income of around £13,500. An estimated 5.28million people earn less than the living wage, which is £7.85.

In contrast, Broad is one of 16 England cricketers on a lucrative contract awarded by the England and Wales Cricket Board. The ECB does not reveal the exact pay package but the basic salary is understood to be £700,000 a year, plus four-figure sums for each appearance.

In 2011, the Sunday Times reported Broad was among a clutch of professional English cricketers to hit the £1million earnings mark for the first time.

Mubin Haq of anti-poverty charity Trust For London, told the Evening Standard: ‘It doesn’t take a huge amount to be in the top 10 per cent of earners in the world … But whilst a minimum wage income would be enough to live on in places like Mumbai, it’s certainly not sufficient to survive in London. The costs of living we face here are significantly higher and this is why Stuart Broad’s comments are causing offence, whether he meant it or not.’

Apologising last night, Broad wrote: ‘Clarifying my earlier tweet, I merely wanted to emphasise my amazement at just how big the world is. No offence meant and sorry if any taken. The hashtag was aimed at myself.’

But the criticism continued. Twitter user John Ingamells, 53, wrote: ‘I welcome opportunity to hear just how stupid, ignorant + out of touch some professional sportsmen appear to be.’
