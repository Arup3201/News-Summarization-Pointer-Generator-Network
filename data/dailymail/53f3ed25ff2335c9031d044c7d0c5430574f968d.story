HANDS OFF IN THE BOX is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box.

Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating.

And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League.

For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that.

So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees.

We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it.

Sportsmail has launched a campaign to stop exponents of the penalty box dark arts getting away with blatant cheating.

Hands Off In The Box aims to put an end to the increasing amount of wrestling, grappling and shirt pulling that goes on  throughout the Premier League.

Those who commit these offences are quite simply denying the football-watching public more goals.

And although this has been going on for years in the Premier League, the sight of Manchester United's Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo manhandling Chelsea's John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic on Sunday was a new low.

It was more reminiscent of a wrestling match than a top-flight football game as the Chelsea duo were grappled to the ground with a combination of headlocks and pull downs.

More astonishing was the fact that referee Phil Dowd did nothing to stop them, waving away claims to what seemed to everyone else to be an obvious penalty.

Now, the key point here is that Manchester United are no worse than any other team for committing these offences, it's just that Sunday's grappling was so high profile.

Sportsmail has decided that enough is enough.

John Terry, Chelsea captain

‘Me and Branislav Ivanovic were double headlocked at every corner.’

Colin Pascoe, Liverpool assistant manager

‘Grappling. That is the new word is it? It is the referees’ interpretation and we’ll leave it to them. That’s what the referees and the officials are paid for. They make decisions. So whatever they decide is grappling, or holding, it’s in their hands really. Did I do it as player? No, I was a winger and didn’t have to mark anyone.’ ian wright Ex-Arsenal striker

‘There should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set-pieces. It was like UFC in the United area.’

Graham Poll, Former top referee

‘Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned. Once fans, managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims.’

Martin Keown, Ex-Arsenal defender

‘Defenders are checking, blocking, holding, grappling, using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place.’

Micky Mellon, Shrewsbury Town manager

‘In a congested area how can you judge if someone’s been blocked? It’s part of the game and some people are good at it. It’s football. A local Football League referee came in and he was asking me about it. “Can you show me some blocking techniques?” That was great, he was trying to find ways of detecting it. The confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free-kicks, but the same won’t be given as penalties. There has to be consistency.’

And the readers of MailOnline...

‘It’s more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves. It’s about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players.’ Willdajack, Neath

‘To those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties, that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop. I’ve been watching football since the Sixties and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst I’ve ever seen.’ Sir Miles Platting, Manchester
