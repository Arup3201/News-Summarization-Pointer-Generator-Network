Astronauts on board the International Space Station will celebrate New Year's Day 16 times as it repeatedly crosses the globe. 

The 'official' New Year starts on the space ship at midnight GMT which is also known as the Universal Time Clock. 

However, Expedition 42 crew, who are travelling at 17,500 miles-per-hour will pass a point on the earth at the stroke of midnight today a staggering 16 times.

Commander Barry “Butch” Wilmore and his crew, which includes NASA’s Terry Virts, Russian cosmonauts Elena Serova, Alexander Samoukutyaev and Anton Shkaplerov, and European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti, say they plan to celebrate with fruit juice toasts. 

The crew are scheduled to have New Year's Day off. 

However, they have been busy with a range of experiments and are preparing for the next delivery of supplies on January 6.  

Commander Wilmore will use a 58-foot robotic arm to grab the resupply space craft by its tail and bring it into the space station's dock where it will be unloaded of its 3,7000 pounds of scientific experiments and supplies. 

The current experiments onboard the ISS include one which looks at the long term effects of space travel on the human eye. 

A second looks at the effect of environmental disasters on the earth's surface.  

This year has been highly successful for the ISS with what is quite possible the world's best selfie
