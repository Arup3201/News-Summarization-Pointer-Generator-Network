A new book about business mogul Sir Richard Branson claims his bold plans for a space tourism company are in danger of turning into an expensive 'white elephant'.

Branson Behind The Mask, by Tom Bower, claims Virgin Galactic hasn't got a powerful enough rocket to take customers into space and no licence from American aviation chiefs to do so, despite the billionaire's confident claims that flights will begin in Autumn.

'Virgin Galactic is in danger of turning into a white elephant,' he told the Sunday Times. He added that Branson had so far only managed to 'fire a primitive rocket for 20 seconds in the Earth's atmosphere'.

During a test flight in California, Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo reached a top speed of Mach 1.4. But the author says more needs to be done to get tourists into orbit

So far Virgin Galactic has accepted more than £42million in deposits from approximately 580 individuals, according to its website. It has also applied for a licence from the US Federal Aviation Administration.

The news comes as it emerged that Chinese nationals have been banned from boarding Branson’s space flights – in case they steal the rocket technology.

Tycoons from China have been told they cannot be among the space tourists because of anti-espionage regulations in the US, from where the British firm’s first commercial flights are due to take off later this year.

A spokesman for Branson said Virgin Galactic had made good progress, adding: 'Our scheduling has always been predicated on doing it the right way, not the fast way.'

Virgin Galactic, owned by Sir Richard’s Virgin Group and and an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm, aims to be the world’s first commercial spaceline.

New spaceships (SpaceShipTwo, VSS Enterprise) and carrier craft (WhiteKnightTwo, VMS Eve) are being developed for Virgin Galactic’s vehicle fleet by Mojave-based Scaled Composites.

Last week SpaceShipTwo reached its maximum velocity of Mach 1.4, which is equivalent to approximately 767mph at sea level.The speeds during this third test flight also helped the aircraft reach an altitude of 71,000ft.

Bower, a journalist and investigative historian, has previously published a book on Branson and has also written books about Robert Maxwell, Mohamed Al-Fayed, Gordon Brown and Simon Cowell.

In 2003, Bower won the William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award for Broken Dreams, an investigation into corruption in English football.
