Livingston were hit with an SPFL transfer embargo on Tuesday night after admitting making undeclared cash payments to players.

And the troubled Championship club are also the subject of a fresh SFA investigation – just days after major shareholder Neil Rankine was accused of breaching fit and proper person regulations.

Currently being sued by former chief executive Ged Nixon for £311,892, the West Lothian outfit wrote to the Hampden authorities blaming Nixon for making ‘improper’ payments worth £10,500.

Nursing debts of £1.7million, the club claim they discovered the payments and other irregularities after calling in forensic accountants before immediately declaring them to the SPFL and SFA before they came out in court.

Last night, 50-per-cent shareholder Neil Rankine accused Nixon of placing the club’s future at peril, telling Sportsmail: ‘This morning we were hit with a transfer embargo based on a self declaration from the club to the SPFL and SFA dated July 31.

‘The club has declared its findings into its own investigation into a £311,000 claim against the club by the former chief executive Ged Nixon.

‘We dispute that claim and in his own loan account he has made £10,500 worth of unauthorised cash payments to players.

‘In 2010 and 2011, we believe Ged Nixon made improper cash bonus payments to players – unknown to any other directors of shareholders.

‘I don’t think there is any hiding that. We expected that to come out in a court case now rescheduled for next March and the club felt it had to make a declaration of our findings to the necessary authorities.

‘We have that declared in the list of monies he is suing us for. It’s on his own list of cash due.

‘The club has now made these declarations to the relevant authorities and the first response has been from the SPFL, who have informed the chairman Gordon McDougall that the club is under a transfer embargo until the matter is fully investigated.

‘The full consequences of Ged Nixon’s actions are as yet undetermined. Those are for the SFA to determine.

‘But in my opinion there is no one guilty here except Ged Nixon.

‘I do take my share of responsibility in this because I spotted this guy’s shortcomings and tried to have him removed in 2011.

‘But Nixon survived on a casting vote in November 2011.’

The latest wrangle marks another chapter in the tempestuous history of a club enmeshed in controversy and financial strife during the Dominic Keane and Angelo Massone eras.

‘Livingston has continually had people who live beyond their means,’ added Rankine.

‘Mr Nixon came in here, in my opinion, as Mister Big Shot and got involved in offering inducements to players unknown to any other players or officials.

‘But I have a track record of investing and saving clubs and I intend to see Livingston out of this.

‘My position at the moment is that of an unpaid consultant.’

Rankine also faces an SFA fit and proper person over claims he failed to act ‘in the best interests of association football’ by failing to declare a financial involvement in East Fife and Dumbarton. The action could now force him to hand his shares in Livingston over to fans and walk away.

‘That complaint surprises me,’ he continued. ‘In 2000, East Fife were close to going out of business and I encouraged a family I did business with in the antiques trade to club together and pay the money off as a nice wee investment.

‘I was wrong about that because they put in £400,000 and now can’t give it away.

‘All I tried to do was help them to keep the club afloat. I have no shares, never have had and never will have any financial interest in East Fife FC.

‘With Dumbarton, I sold the club in 2008 for £1.7m and the owners still owe me £200,000.

‘Is that a conflict of interest? The SFA must think it is and if it is then I have the choice of either suing Dumbarton for the £200,000 or disposing of my shares in the holding company of Livingston which have a trading value at the moment of zero.

Distraction: On the pitch Livingston had a disappointing start to the season, losing 2-1 to Hibs 

‘It may now be in the best interests of Livingston FC for me to stand down from Livingston 5 (the club’s parent company) and try to accelerate a deal Supporters Direct are trying to push forward for community ownership.

‘But I will be astonished if there is any case to answer, because I have no financial interest in East Fife.

‘The SFA investigated this is 2004 and found no case to answer then. I don’t know what’s changed now.’

A spokesman for the SPFL said: ‘The SPFL has been provided with information by a Livingston Football Club director which indicates a default in relation to HMRC payments.

‘Under SPFL rules, an embargo on the registration of professional players is automatic in these circumstances.’

When contacted by the media yesterday, Nixon declined to comment on the matter because of the ongoing legal case.
