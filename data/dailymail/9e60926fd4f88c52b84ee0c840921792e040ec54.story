Purses, handbags, pocketbooks: no matter what you call them, you can forget about carrying them with you to your next pro-football game.

The National Football League is tightening stadium security starting this preseason, limiting the size and type of bags fans can bring to the game.

And since the rule includes standard sized purses, lady fans will soon be crying foul.

Scroll down for video...

Clearly: The NFL, in the name of public safety, has banned standard sized purses at all NFL stadiums. Only 'hand-sized' clutches and clear totes are now allowed

With the exception of medically necessary items, only clear plastic, vinyl or PVC bags no larger than 12 inches by 6 inches by 12 inches will be allowed.

One-gallon clear plastic freezer bags also will be OK, as will small clear plastic bags approximately the size of someone's hand, with or without a handle or strap.

One of those clear bags and a small clutch bag will be allowed per person.

The NFL says the restrictions are designed to enhance security while speeding up entry into stadiums, but women say feel they’re being targeted. And some say they may even just skip the upcoming season because of the new rule.

‘I don't like this at all,’ Colts fan Cheyenne McMurray told ABC News.
 ‘I don't want everyone to see what's in my purse. They're still going 
to have to search the plastic bag. It's just going to make everyone more
 upset.’

Banned items 
will include purses larger than a clutch bag; coolers; briefcases; 
backpacks; fanny packs; cinch bags; seat cushions; luggage; computer 
bags; and camera bags or any bag larger than the permissible size.

Female football fan site TheFootballGirl.com is also unhappy with the rule. They write:

'What
 the league considers an improvement to public safety, I consider a 
setback for all fans, particularly women. Women carry purses...mostly 
because of the functionality. By asking women to leave their purses at 
home ...the league is disconnecting from a fan base they are supposedly 
working so hard to expand.'

Awfully specific: No purses are allowed, but clear plastic totes, which the NFL conveniently licenses, are allowed under strict parameters. Non-licensed totes are also allowed so long as they fit the parameters

Instead of a purse, the NFL is recommending fans take with them clear totes. Conveniently, a line of such totes are licensed to carry the logo of every NFL team.

An NFL committee on stadium security recommended these measures in May and the owners have approved them.

The NFL ramped up security at the draft in late April, its one major event since the Boston Marathon bombings.

Recently, the NFL has done pat downs and bag checks and also used metal detectors to upgrade security. The new policy announced Thursday has worked well at colleges such as Penn State, Michigan and Michigan State, which do not permit any bags in their stadiums. Boston's TD Garden allows only clutch bags.

Pack light: Large purse loving women will now have to switch to clutches that fit within very specific parameters if they want to see a live pro football game

‘Our fans deserve to be in a safe and secure environment,’ Jeffrey Miller, the NFL's chief security officer, said. ‘Public safety is our top priority. This will make the job of checking items much more efficient and effective. We will be able to deliver a better and quicker experience at the gates and also provide a safer environment. We appreciate our fans' cooperation.’

Binoculars, cameras, and smartphones also will be permitted.

The league is encouraging fans not to bring any bags to games.

A secondary buffer area well outside the stadium will be established where security personnel will check for prohibited items or bags being carried toward the ballpark. Fans with prohibited bags will be turned away until they dispose of those bags. Stadium personnel are being encouraged to have approved bags on hand to give to fans, or to have a place outside the restricted areas to check items, so that fans can reclaim after games.
