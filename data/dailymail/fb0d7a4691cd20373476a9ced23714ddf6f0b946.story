The Liberal Democrat conference grew increasingly stormy today, as delegates in Glasgow were battered by high winds.

The main entrance to the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre was closed to activists, who arrived with a warning to Nick Clegg that they want a power-sharing deal with Labour after the next election.

However the Lib Dem leader hinted he would prefer a power-sharing deal
with the Tories, arguing he wants the chance to 'finish the job' of repairing the economy begun in partnership with David Cameron.

The first full day of the conference proved hair-raising for some

The Lib Dem leader insisted he had not held secret talks about forming a government with either of the main parties - but then saved his biggest economic criticism for Labour.

But it risks infuriating his party members demoing the Lib Dems to forge a power-sharing deal with Labour after the next election.

Mr Clegg has ordered his ministers ‘lift the veil’ on private battles with the Tories in government, including policy fights over welfare, employment law, immigration and climate change.

But challenged over the role the Lib Dems would play working with either party in 2015, Mr Clegg appeared to favour the Tories.

He claimed Labour left to run the country alone would 'wreck' the economy, but suggested only that the Tories would not be quite as fair.

He told BBC1's Andrew Marr programme: 'It is my genuine belief that if you go  back to the bad old days, not of coalition and balanced politics, but either the left or the right dominating government on their own, you will get a recovery that is neither fair nor sustainable.

'I think Labour would wreck the recovery, and under the Conservatives, who don’t have the same commitment to fairness that we do, you’d get the wrong kind of recovery. 

'So our message is: coalition is good; what the Liberal Democrats have done in government is good. Let us finish the job, but let us finish it fairly.'

The Independent on Sunday published a 
poll conducted by the website Liberal Democrat Voice, which found that 
39 per cent of activists questioned would prefer a Lib Dem-Labour 
coalition after 2015, compared with just 15 per cent who favour another 
coalition with the Conservatives.

A further 15 per cent of those 
questioned said that, in the event of a hung parliament, Mr Clegg's 
party should forge a "confidence and supply" agreement with Labour, 
under which Lib Dems would not enter coalition but would undertake not 
to bring down the minority government or vote against its Budget.

Just 6 per cent wanted an arrangement of this kind with Tories.

Mr
Clegg predicted more coalitions in future, suggesting Labour and the 
Conservatives will have to draw up a ‘shopping list’ manifesto, with a 
handful of key policiies and others which could be haggled over during 
coalition talks.

He said: 
‘In my view it is going to more likely than not that in the future 
you’re going to get more coalitions, it is less likely that you’re going
to these slam-dunk results when one or the other of the two major 
parties always get a majority.

‘I
think it is incumbent on all political parties to be up front with the 
British people – as we were  last time – about those issues which you 
really will die in the trench for, and those which clearly will depend 
on political and economic circumstances.’

In the pink: Nick Clegg boasted that his party was making a difference in government

He
said his focus was on returning to the Lib Dems to power in 2015, and 
hinted at a desire to continue working with the Tories on the economic 
plan which is already underway.

'Our
message to the British people in 2015 will be essentially this: we will
say: we’ve done very good things in government, but let us finish the 
job and finish the job fairly.

'Because
there are millions of people in this country who have made huge 
sacrifices, we’ve gone through this very difficult time over the last 
two or three years – that would be squandered if you had a single-party 
government of either the Labour [party] or the Conservatives in 2015.

'I
think Labour would wreck the recovery, and under the Conservatives, who
don’t have the same commitment to fairness that we do, you’d get the 
wrong kind of recovery.'

Prediction: The Lib Dem leader told Andrew Mar there would be more coalitions in future - and all parties had to prepare for talks

Damning: Vicky Pryce says it is a 'myth' that taxing high value property could be a source of income for the Government

Nick Clegg stepped up calls 
for higher taxes on the wealthy, as he signalled soaking the rich will 
be a key demand of the Lib Dems at the next election.

He said the party's commitment to a mansion tax on properties over £2
million, raising £2 billion, sent a signal that 'even though we are 
committed to deficit reduction' that would not be achieved entirely 
through spending cuts.

He told the BBC: 'Taxes and particularly taxes on people 
who can afford it, have to play some role in the ongoing effort to 
making sure that we complete the job of filling the black hole in the 
public finances.

'If the Conservatives don't want to do 
that then they need to tell people, and that's part of the debate we 
will have to have over the next year-and-a-half, what they will cut - 
schools or hospitals or pensions or police or the armed services - to 
make up that £2 billion.'

However Mr Clegg's plans for a ‘mansion tax’ have been savaged by Vicky Pryce – former wife of disgraced Lib Dem MP Chris Huhne.

Ms Pryce says it is a ‘myth’ that taxing homes worth more than £2 million will be a ‘magic source of income’ for the Government.

Ms Pryce, who will attend the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, dismisses the whole idea of a 
mansion tax, which has been blocked by the Conservatives.

In
an article for today’s Mail on Sunday, she says: ‘It is a tax that is 
set at an arbitrary level with no  economic justification for that level
or the rate imposed – except to raise a certain amount of money’ and ‘a
mantra for those who feel there is a hidden reservoir of taxes just 
waiting to be tapped’.

Ms 
Pryce also pointedly disagrees with her friend Vince Cable, the Business
Secretary, who has raised fears that Coalition plans for low-deposit 
mortgages could lead to a new house price bubble.

‘There are concerns over a housing market bubble – expressed by Vince Cable no less – but I don’t share them,’ she says.
