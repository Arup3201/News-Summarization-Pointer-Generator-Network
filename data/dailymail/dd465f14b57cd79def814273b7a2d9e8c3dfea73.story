A squalid rat-infested home that had an estimated 40 years’ worth of waste crammed inside as high as the ceilings has been discovered, taking a team of six people a month to clear.

The authorities were alerted to the state of the privately owned home in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, by a neighbour who had noticed rats entering her home from the adjoining property.

Once inside the house, dubbed a 'DIY landfill site' they found rotting rubbish and food packaging, which took a month to clear with the team working every day to clean up the waste under a warrant issued by Grimsby Magistrates’ Court under the Public Health Act 1936.

The mammoth clearing operation, which began in August, saw 144 tonnes of waste removed - roughly the same weight as a blue whale or a small jumbo jet.

John Waite from North East Lincolnshire Council Community Pride said day-to-day waste including food packaging had begun to decompose after an estimated 30 or 40 years.

He said the waste gave off a 'tremendous heat' and that the foundations left below the property had started to decay, needing substantial work to repair them.

Inside the overgrown garden of the property were two vehicles, one was hidden in weeds, the other , a 4x4 that was used a dump, while inside the house rubbish was piled as high as the ceiling in some rooms.

Maggots and rats had 'infiltrated' neighbouring properties and the gas meter, installed in 2007, had never been used.

Neighbours, who identified the occupier of the house as a single elderly man, were shocked to hear about the squalor next door and claim the occupant is usually smartly dressed but his messy home is obscured by a large hedge.

The mammoth clearing operation, which began in August, saw a team of six people work to clean up the house, which had been occupied by a retired accountant in his 70s

One neighbour, who would not be named, said the occupant, a retired accountant in his seventies, had lived in the house for at least 40 years.

He said: 'He is a very private man and I am shocked because he always dresses well and would always stop to tip his hat and exchange pleasantries in the street. We had no idea what was going on. It is very sad.'

Another neighbour, who would not be named, added: 'He bought the six cats recently to help with the rats and mice.' 

Meanwhile Mr Waite described the inside of the house as 'putrid' and that there had been moves to clear the house without the intervention of the council.

He said: 'There were thorough enquiries made and attempts to resolve it with authority intervention but sadly those attempts failed and the authority had no choice but to serve a notice under the Public Health Act.

'We obtained a warrant from Grimsby Magistrates’ Court to enter the grounds and the property for the purpose of removing filthy and verminous items. The owner-occupier is currently being cared for by partner agencies.

A warrant was issued by Grimsby Magistrates’ Court under the Public Health Act 1936 to enter the house, which gave off a 'tremendous heat' due to the waste inside 

'It’s putrid. There’s decomposed rubbish. It’s day-to-day (waste) that the owner hasn't cleared and then it has started to decompose.

'The team had to clear the outside and that took a number of days just to get to the front door to enter. Only then was it safe to commence the operation.

'Everything that comes out has to be logged. It’s likely that it won’t be habitable for some considerable time.

'A situation like that is not good for the occupier but also surrounding residents and whilst we accept that everyone is entitled to a lifestyle, when that starts to impact on adjoining properties – which it did in this case – we must intervene,' he added.

A council spokesperson said: 'The works to clear the house have now been completed and a full survey has been undertaken to assess all requirements to bring the property back to a lawful, habitable condition. This will, of course, take time.

'Pest control, in and around the boundaries, will take place over the next two weeks.'

According to the local council, the foundations are beginning to decay below the property, which now needs substantial work to bring it back up to standard 

Concerns were also raised about the health of a number of cats belonging to the owner and were living in the house but the local council say they are being cared for on a daily basis 

Concerns were also raised about the health of a number of cats belonging to the owner of the house.

The council added: 'The cats belong to the owner occupier and will be removed into the care of a personal friend during all further works. 

'We have no concerns relating to their current condition or ongoing care and they have been fed and watered on a daily basis.'

A spokesperson for the RSPCA said: 'The cats have not been abandoned and are being attended to.

'We are also in touch with other agencies who are also attending the property regularly.'
