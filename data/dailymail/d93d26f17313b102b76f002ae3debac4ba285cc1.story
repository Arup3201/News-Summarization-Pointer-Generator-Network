Bubba Watson has celebrated his second Masters win in two years with a trip to Waffle House.

The down-to-earth golfer, who graciously claimed his win was down to 'luck', uploaded a photo to Twitter showing him and his wife at the restaurant, writing: 'Champ dinner @WaffleHouse! #hashbrowns #covered.'

It came just hours after the 35-year-old overtook 20-year-old Jordan Spieth to claim the green jacket.

After his spectacular win, Watson celebrated on the green with kisses from his wife Angie and their two-year-old son Caleb.

It seems that Caleb is somewhat of a good luck charm for the Florida-born golfer; he won his first Masters title in 2012, just weeks after the couple adopted the baby boy.

And after that win, the self-proclaimed 'small town guy' had a familiar subject on his mind: Waffle House.

The Golf Channel asked what the Champions Dinner would be at Augusta National the following year.

'I love Waffle House - a grilled cheese from Waffle House and hash browns,' he said.

In this year's competition, Watson had trailed Spieth by two shots after seven holes of the final round, but birdied the eighth and ninth as Spieth bogeyed both.

His lead was cut to a shot by a bogey on 
the 10th, but a massive drive on the par-five 13th set up a birdie that 
gave the left-hander a three-shot cushion over the closing stretch.

Only
 a handful of players have won more than one Masters title, including 
the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Nick Faldo, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, 
but Watson was not about to accept the label of an elite player.

'No,
 no,' Watson said. 'Again, I just got lucky enough to have two green 
jackets. I'm just trying to keep my tour card every year and if people 
say that I'm a good player, that's great.

'I'm
 trying to play golf for a living. I'm not trying to play golf for 
everybody to tell me how great I am or I'm one of the greats of the 
game. I play golf because I love it, I love the game, I want to grow the
 game. The game has brought me everything that I've ever owned in my 
life.'

Watson crucially 
matched Spieth's birdies on the fourth and sixth - the former after 
Spieth had holed out from a greenside bunker, but felt his birdies on 
the eighth and ninth were vital.

'Eight and nine were really the 
turning point where momentum kind of went my way,' he added. 'Then the 
group in front of us and other groups, you could just tell, just nobody 
really caught fire. There wasn't too many birdies after number 10 I 
don't think.

'I don't 
remember the last few holes, I just remember hanging on, making pars. 
Somehow I did and walking up 18 was a little easier this time.'

Watson,
 who beat Louis Oosthuizen in a play-off two years ago, added: 'This one
 is a lot different. The first one is almost like I lucked into it, this
 was a lot of hard work and dedication and I got back the green jacket 
after giving it away last year.'

As defending champion last year, Watson presented the green jacket to then-winner Adam Scott. On Sunday the roles were reversed.

'I told Adam we should just keep switching it back and forth,' Watson joked.

As well as sharing his Waffle House selfie on Twitter, Watson took a moment to thank his fans online after his win.

'Wow. I can't believe I have another @The_Masters green jacket!' he wrote on Twitter. 'Such an honor. #Rejoicing.

'I
 want to thank everyone for the support, encouraging words & 
congrats that have poured in this week! I feel incredibly blessed # 
awesomefans.'

Spieth, 
who was looking to become the youngest ever Masters champion, carded a 
closing 72 to share second place with Sweden's Jonas Blixt.

Disappointment: But Spieth, from Dallas, Texas, struggled on the back nine and missed out on the jacket

'It was so much fun, even if I did not show it on the back nine,' he said. 'Although it stings right now I will be back and I can't wait to be back. That's what's on my mind because it's tough being in this position.

'I've worked my whole life to lead in the Masters on Sunday, I had it in my hands and could have gone forward with it and didn't quite make the putts and that's what it came down to.

'I wanted to get into contention and that's what happened but I can take a lot of positives away. My game held up and I feel like am ready to win a major. It's just a matter of time and maybe a little bit of course knowledge.

'Ultimately hats off to him. He's a 
deserving Masters champion this year. He played some incredible golf to 
make his pars down the stretch.'
