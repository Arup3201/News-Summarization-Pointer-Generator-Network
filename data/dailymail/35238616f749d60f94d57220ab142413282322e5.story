That Cyril Smith was a paedophile is known. But in a devastating book - serialised in the Mail this week - Labour MP Simon Danczuk exposes the industrial scale of his debauchery and how the Establishment, Liberal Party, police chiefs and even MI5 covered it up.

Today Danczuk, MP for Smith’s old Rochdale seat, reveals how the 29-stone monster was saved from prosecution time after time...

After spending many months wading through abuse, despair and wretched politics in pursuit of Cyril Smith, I had just about gone as far as I thought possible.

I wasn’t sure if I had the stomach to deal with much more — when a key piece of the jigsaw I’d almost given up on finally turned up.

I got access to the police files on Cyril Smith.

No more lies: In his new book, Labour MP Simon Danczuk exposes how the Establishment, Liberal Party, police chiefs and even MI5 covered up Cyril Smith's sexual abuse

I was in a restaurant in London when I
 first got sight of them. They were placed in front of me by a 
journalist, and I put the menu down and started to devour every word.

There
 was plenty there that I already knew, having pieced it together from 
other sources; but there was one section that quickly grabbed my 
attention.

Henry Howarth had succeeded Cyril as mayor of Rochdale in 1967 and was the leader of the Rochdale Liberal Party.

During the police investigation into Cyril at the end of the 1960s, he was interviewed by Detective Sergeant Jeffrey Leach.

Howarth offered some robust advice to the police regarding the prospect of charging Cyril with child abuse.

Protected: Cyril Smith, pictured with fellow Liberal Democrats Jo Grimond, David Steel and Jeremy Thorpe, was 'allowed' to continue his abuse despite police trying to investigate

‘May I offer a personal opinion,’ he 
began. ‘I sincerely hope that this matter is not prosecuted before the 
court. In my opinion, as a Justice of the Peace, it is not court worthy.

‘The
 prosecution can do no good at all, and the backlash will have 
unfortunate repercussions for the police force and the town of Rochdale.
 It is no secret that Cyril and I are buddies, and not only 
politically.’

In other words, the leader of the 
local Liberal Party was threatening the police. Notes from Detective 
Sergeant Leach underneath this account acknowledge as much.

‘The veiled threats and innuendoes contained therein,’ he remarks, ‘reflect Howarth’s general attitude to this inquiry.’

I’d
 already known that Cyril was leaning hard on the police, but I didn’t 
know that the local Liberal Party was doing the same. What ‘unfortunate 
repercussions’ for the police could Howarth possibly have had in mind as
 he tried to bully them into dropping their investigation?

'The door was open': His victim says he will never forget how Cyril Smith, pictured with then Liberal leader David Steel in 1977, abused him in the House of Commons

Reading on, it quickly becomes 
apparent that Leach has doubts about Rochdale police. Referring to 
evidence of Cyril’s abuse given by the council’s children’s officer, 
Lyndon Price, Leach casts doubt on whether Rochdale’s Chief Constable 
Patrick Ross ever acted on it.

‘It is quite feasible,’ he notes, ‘that Mr Ross would keep it to himself because of the status of the man involved.’

As he found he could get away with his abuse, Cyril Smith began to take more risks, as Ron Foynes testified.

A member of the Royal Military Police based at Rochester Row in Westminster in the late Seventies, Ron got in touch to share what was an open secret at the time.

‘Cyril Smith was into young boys, we all knew that,’ he said. ‘We heard plenty of stories about him.’

These stories would be shared at the Corporals Mess bar where Ron and his fellow RMP officers socialised with the Royal Parks Constabulary, whose police station was in St James’s Park.

‘The Parks officers explained how they carried out observations and arrests in the male public toilets in the park, close to the junction of Marlborough Road and the Mall,’ he said.

‘These toilets were a regular meeting place for homosexuals and young male prostitutes after dark.’

On a number of occasions police officers had detained Cyril Smith after he was caught ‘in acts of gross indecency with young lads’ at these toilets.

On each occasion, they’d been told by those higher up the chain of command to discontinue their inquiries due to the status of the individual concerned.

How many times had Cyril Smith been arrested or pulled in by police only to be released as soon as the phone call from high office was made?

I wondered if he actually got a thrill out of being caught — knowing they couldn’t pin anything on him because he was a protected man.

The files also offered clues to the defence that Cyril was prepared to give if the matter went to court. Under questioning, he tried to claim he was in loco parentis where the boys abused at local schools and hostels were concerned.

They were on his property, and in all matters medical and relating to general discipline, Cyril claimed the boys had signed off legal responsibility for him to care for them. In other words, he could do whatever he wanted.

Detective Inspector Leach knew only too well that no court in the land would buy this.

‘In my opinion,’ he wrote, ‘it is without merit. It will not withstand even superficial examination.’

Concluding, Leach seemed confident of a prosecution. Under questioning, Cyril ‘had difficulty articulating, and even the stock answers he offered could only be obtained after repeated promptings by his solicitor’.

Unfortunately, the Director of Public Prosecutions did not share the same confidence.

In a letter to Lancashire Police in 1970, DPP Sir Norman Skelhorn said he did not consider there to be a reasonable prospect of a conviction. Referring to the statements by Cyril’s victims, he said: ‘The characters of some of these young men would be likely to render their evidence suspect.’

It may as well have said that as long as a high-profile politician decides to abuse boys of lowly social status, then there is zero chance of him being prosecuted. It more or less outlined a code of conduct for abusers. Stick to vulnerable people from broken homes and the law will give you a wide berth.

The injustice contained in these words is as strong now as it was then. It was a loophole so huge that even someone as gargantuan as Cyril could skip through.
