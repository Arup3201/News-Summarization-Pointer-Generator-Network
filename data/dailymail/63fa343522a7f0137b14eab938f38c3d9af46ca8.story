'What a real mum looks like': Kate cradles her post-baby bump as she and William show off their newborn son outside St Mary's hospital yesterday

Her hair was perfectly styled, thanks to the attentions of her personal stylist.

She had applied her customary black eyeliner, her cheeks glowed with good health – and her smile threatened to outshine the hundreds of flashbulbs on the pavement outside.

But for the mothers watching around the world as the Duchess of Cambridge walked out on to the steps of the Lindo Wing yesterday, the real delight was her ‘mummy tummy’.

That neat bump was the only thing which gave away the fact Kate had given birth to an 8lb 6oz boy just a day earlier.

And the glowing duchess clearly felt no need to hide it, a decision praised immediately by mothers’ groups.

Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said the duchess had dispelled the ‘myth that all mothers should be perfect postpartum’.

‘In a couple of minutes on the steps of the Lindo Wing Kate has done more for new mums’ self-esteem than any other role model,’ she said.

‘Sadly, too many celebrities often have ultra-fast tummy tucks or strap themselves down to emerge in tiny size six jeans, leaving everyone else feeling inadequate.

‘Kate shows what a real mum looks like – and natural is beautiful.’

She continued: ‘Undoubtedly over the coming weeks the duchess will work hard to regain her figure, but tonight she’s proved herself a healthy role model for real mums around the world.’

Many mothers took to Mumsnet to share their delight, describing Kate as a ‘role model’ for showing off her mummy tummy.

One user wrote: ‘Oh just so lovely … I think she is fantastically brave to not hide her post birth shape. What a great role model she is.’

A second wrote: ‘I loved that Kate didn’t hide her remaining bump. That is what a postnatal woman looks like folks!’

Another added: ‘They both looked fab, and I was also impressed that she didn’t hide the belly, good for her!’

A fourth wrote: ‘I’ve got tears in my eyes here. So glad Kate didn’t try to hide her bump like so many celebrities do. Good for her.

‘I think my own squishy belly was the first immediately post-natal one I’d ever seen. Well done Kate!’   

A neat bump: Mothers' groups were delighted at the Duchess's decision not to hide her bump, with Netmums' founder Siobhan Freegard saying she had dispelled the 'myth that all mothers should be perfect postpartum'

The sight of Kate still carrying a bump after childbirth will have gladdened the hearts of new mums under pressure to regain their figure.

It takes around ten days for the womb to contract back to its normal size, and the Duchess looks ‘completely normal’, according to Clare Byam-Cook, a child care expert.

Providing there is not excessive weight gain, most of the pounds gained during pregnancy disappear with the arrival of the baby. The shedding of the placenta – the baby’s life support and nutritional system in the womb – and amniotic fluid also help the body regain its shape.

Breastfeeding further  helps weight loss and  assists the womb to contract more quickly.

Miss Byam-Cook advised new mothers to relax and enjoy their baby. ‘The weight will, in most cases, take care of itself,’ she said.

Twitter was also dominated by women praising Kate for refusing to hide her figure.

Stacey Cook said: ‘Nice to see Kate still has a mummy tummy! Not like these skinny celebs who come out stick thin.’

Ju Lincoln wrote: ‘Beautiful royal baby and lovely to see that Kate still has a mummy tummy like all us normal women … I’m still trying to lose mine!’

Indeed, the general agreement last night was that the Duchess of Cambridge looked ‘utterly fabulous’ as she presented her new son to the world.

Kate, whose style over the last nine 
months has already become a by-word for pregnancy chic, did not 
disappoint with her choice of dress. Her bespoke blue polka-dot Jenny 
Packham frock looked cool and chic, its empire line cut perfectly 
displaying her ‘mummy tummy’.

Her
 choice of print seemed to be a nod to the dress worn by Princess Diana 
on the day she left hospital with Prince William in 1982.

She posed on the same steps with her first-born son, wearing a green polka dot dress.

'Utterly fabulous': Women writing on Twitter also hailed the duchess for her choice of dress which revealed the bump

A nod to Diana? The late Princess of Wales posed on the same steps with her first-born son, Kate's husband Prince William wearing a green dress with similar polka dots to the one worn by Kate yesterday

But where Diana appeared nervous and bewildered by the attention – and was said to have burst into tears as soon as she got in the car – the radiant duchess smiled broadly and spoke assuredly to the ranks of camera crews.

And while Charles wore a formal pinstripe suit and tie, William opted for a casual shirt, the blue perfectly matching his wife’s dress.

And, naturally for this very hands-on new father, the sleeves were rolled up.
