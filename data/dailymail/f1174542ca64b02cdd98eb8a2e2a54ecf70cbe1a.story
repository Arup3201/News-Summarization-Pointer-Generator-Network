Two former Indiana cops who are married to each other have been arrested and charged amid allegations of being involved in one of the country's biggest-ever drug busts.

Jason Woods, 44, and Teresa Woods, 34, were booked into the Boone County Jail on Thursday on two counts of possession of a synthetic drug or synthetic drug lookalike.

Police allege the arrests are linked to an illegal 'Spice' ring headquartered in central Indiana that was shut down last year, leading to over 12 arrests.

Indiana State Police called it the largest operation in state history and one of the largest in the nation, according to Fox 59. 

Busted: Teresa Woods, 43, and her husband Jason Woods, 44, have both been charged with two counts of possession of a synthetic drug or synthetic drug lookalike

Charged: The couple were fired from their positions as Hendricks County deputies earlier this year for being found in possession of thousands of dollars in missing money

Over 500 pounds of synthetic drugs were seized in New Palestine as part of that operation.

Police now say they have been onto the Woods since the bust. 

'The Woods’ name came up in the course of that investigation,' Captain David Bursten, Spokesperson for Indiana State Police, told Fox 59.

The Woods were caught with over 100 grams of synthetic drugs and $80,000.

The family of Theresa Woods are believed to have dobbed in the couple, calling police to say the drugs and money were being kept in a safe.  

The couple were arrested at the Indianapolis office of Homeland Security Investigations on charges of possession of a synthetic drug.

No comment: Jason Woods would not talk to the media after bonding out of Boone County jail

Scene: Over 500 pounds of synthetic drugs were seized in New Palestine, Indiana, as part of a Spice ring raid in 2013 that was one of the biggest-ever in the country

'We were able to get a search warrant,' Burstein told Fox 59.

'From that, we found inside over 100 grams of synthetic drugs and we also found $80,000 in cash.' 

The two have not been charged in relation to the 2013 Spice ring.

It is not known whether they will face charges in relation to that bust. 

Warrant: The Woods allegedly had about 100 grams of drugs and $80,000 cash locked in a safe at this home

In March the pair were suspended and later fired from their positions as Hendricks County deputies.

They were allegedly found in possession of thousands of dollars of missing money.

The Woods' had said they were keeping the money for a friend.

They were accused of not following the department’s policy as well as not reporting a crime they knew about.
