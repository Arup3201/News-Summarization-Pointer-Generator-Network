A patriotic forklift driver was sacked after he turned up for work in an England flag hat - on St George’s Day.

Adam Lawson, 32, wanted to celebrate England's national day at his job at South Marston Distribution Centre (SDC) in Swindon, Wiltshire.

But the father-of-three was ordered to remove the red and white flat cap because it was not part of the official uniform.

Forklift driver Adam Lawson, from Swindon, Wiltshire, was sacked after refusing to take off a England flag cap at work on St George's Day

The 32-year-old believes St George's day is a proud tradition and said he was not offending anyone with his novelty cap

Mr Lawson refused - and was later told never to come back.

Mr Lawson, who is also from Swindon, said: 'I was told that I couldn’t work while I was wearing it as it did not match uniform standards.

'It is ridiculous, it was St George’s Day and it was a little thing that I wanted to do to celebrate it.

'St George’s Day is part of English culture, I didn’t want to offend anyone or cause malice and I don’t believe I did.

'I’m disgusted as I’m a patriotic guy and to me it is wrong that I wasn’t allowed to celebrate English culture and was deterred from doing so, as I wasn’t doing any harm.

'I think it is a sad state of affairs if we are stopped from acknowledging our culture.'

South Marston Distribution Centre (SDC), where Mr Lawson had worked for eight months, said Mr Lawson was asked not to return because he had 'an issue with the dress code'

Mr Lawson had worked at SDC, which stocks Honda parts, for eight months through the agency Pertemps, He had handed in his notice one day earlier because he had a new job.

But he later received a phone call from the recruitment company, apparently telling him SDC did not want him to work through his notice period.

Mr Lawson, who lives with partner Sam Gregory and three children Paige, six, Lexi, four, and one-year-old Jamie, believes his colleagues are on his side.

He said: 'When I was leaving, a lot of my colleagues came up to me and said they had sympathy for me.

'I got the phone call at about 4pm telling me they didn’t want me back which was a shock as I’d worked really hard there.

'I’d handed my notice in on Tuesday and I think - with all the redundancies going on at the minute - this was just an excuse to get rid of me a few days early.

'I have three children to provide for so I’m pretty annoyed.'

Anne Wilkes, operations director at Pertemps, in Swindon, said: 'The employee did attend work with SDC with a hat on.

'He was asked to remove the hat by a team leader and refused.

'He was asked a second time to remove it, and failure to remove would be that he would be sent home.

'The reason for that is it isn’t part of the personal protection equipment for working on site. Any manufacturing company, including SDC and Honda, have a strict uniform policy.

'He’s been released from assignment at SDC but he’s not been sacked.

'It’s a shame. We’re very very sorry to hear that he had been released.'

Bosses at South Marston Distribution Centre said Mr Lawson was asked to leave the company because he would not comply with uniform requirements.

Steve Gopal, director of operations said: 'The issue from our point of view is relatively simple.

'We have a definite dress code in the business and in this instance the individual was asked to remove the cap because it's not part of our uniform.

'He then stated that rather than take his cap off he would rather go home. We didn't ask him to go home.

'The individual has an issue with the dress code. As a result he was requested not to return.'
