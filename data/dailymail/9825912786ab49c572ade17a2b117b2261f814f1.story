A young British man has been arrested in Bangladesh on suspicion of recruiting would-be jihadists to fight for Islamic State terrorists in Syria and Iraq.

The man, who police named as Samiun Rahman alias Ibne Hamdan, is understood to be of Bangladeshi origin and was arrested near the Kamalapur Railway area of the capital city Dhaka.

He is also suspected of having attempted to recruit militants in the northern city of Sylhet - where he is understood to have relatives - having reportedly first arrived in the country about six months ago to scout for potential extremists.

The arrested man has been identified as Samiun Rahman, sources at the media wing of Dhaka Metropolitan Police told local newspapers. 

He is believed to have arrived in Bangladesh in February and used social media websites including Facebook to sound out local men about their interest in joining ISIS, according Monirul Islam - joint commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police - who was speaking at a press briefing today.

He targetted Muslims from Myammar as well as Bangladesh, Mr Islam added, before saying: 'He also went to Morocco and Mauritania but we are yet to know the reason behind his trips'.

'From his passport we came to know that he went to Syria in September last year and took part in the demonstration against Bashar al- Assad,' the DMP spokesperson went on to say.

The news comes just days after a 22-year-old university student - who also had links to the northern city of Sylhet - was arrested in Dhaka on suspicion of recruiting would-be fighters for ISIS.

Hafizur Rahman, who was studying at Sylhet's Tibbiya Government College, was arrested in the capital's Purana Paltan area of Dhaka on Thursday after being reported for recruiting militants.

Just one day before Hafizur Rahman's arrest, local police detained Asif Adnan, 26, and Fazle Elahi Tanzil, 24, who were allegedly travelling to join ISIS militants in Syria, assisted by an unnamed Briton.

It is understood the suspected would-be jihadists were planning to travel to a Turkish airport popular with tourists, before travelling by road to the Syrian border and then slipping across into the warzone.

Samiun Rahman's arrest came just two days after Bangladeshi detectives revealed they were searching for a London-based ISIS agent who had recruited several young men arrested in recent weeks, according to the Telegraph.

Three alleged recruits were arrested last week, including the son of a retired judge and the other the son of a senior civil servant.

They had been told they would travel to Syria via Turkey posing as followers of Tabligh Jamaat - an Islamic religious study group not affiliated with any terror collective.

Officers first learned that a 24-year-old British man from East London had been enlisting ISIS fighters when they arrested seven young Islamic extremists, the newspaper added.

Among those arrested were an associate of Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis - the 21-year-old student behind the failed 2012 attack on New York's Federal Reserve Bank.

RAF jets flew armed sorties for a second day over Iraq yesterday – but again failed to locate any suitable targets for their weapons.

Defence chiefs insisted that the flights by Tornado GR4 fighter-bombers were invaluable for gathering intelligence on the Islamist jihadists who have swept across large swathes of Iraq and Syria, carrying out massacres.

But the failure to unleash any firepower has fuelled concern that Britain is failing to pull its weight in the international coalition against Islamic State. 

It came as military commanders warned that Britain should brace itself to be dragged into a ground war in Iraq to crush IS, which is also known as Isis and Isil. 

Former top brass also warned that the air campaign would be futile unless the UK could target the terrorists in Syria.

While the Ministry of Defence confirmed that the RAF's third mission had – like on Saturday – failed to locate any targets, US-led coalition aircraft targeted four makeshift oil refineries under IS control in Syria, as well as a command centre.

The mobile refineries generate up to £1.2million a day for the militants. 

The news comes amid reports of fierce fighting in the Baghdad suburbs where ISIS militants are trying to seize control of the Iraqi capital - despite ongoing Western airstrikes against them.

The fighting is taking place just one mile to the west of the city, with government forces desperately trying to hold off the militants, who allegedly killed up to 1,000 soldiers during clashes yesterday.

ISIS have held a number of towns and villages close to the Iraqi capital since earlier in the year, when government troops melted away following a lightning advance in the west of the country - enabling the terrorist group to seize further swaths of territory for their so-called caliphate.

Reports that ISIS militants are now just one mile from Baghdad came from the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East - an organisation supporting the work of Canon Andrew White, vicar of the city's St George's Church, the only Anglican church in Iraq.

In a message posted on Facebook, the group said: 'The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad. They said it could never happen and now it almost has.

'Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be hear a very short while to know they can do very very little,' they added.

The claims were backed up by Canon White himself, who shared the message just hours after he had earlier suggested the group were approximately six miles from Baghdad.
