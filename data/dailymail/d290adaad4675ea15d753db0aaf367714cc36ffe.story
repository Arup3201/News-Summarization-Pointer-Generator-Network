David Cameron was ambushed by one of his parliamentary candidates yesterday to be told she was defecting to UKIP.

Victoria Ayling, left, who was within 714 votes of becoming Tory MP for Grimsby at the 2010 General Election, claims the Prime Minister ‘lost his temper’ when she told him she was joining Nigel Farage’s party.

Mrs Ayling cornered Mr Cameron after he 
spoke at the Conservative spring conference and told him she was leaving
because the Tories are ‘no longer the party of aspiration’.

Victoria Ayling, who defected to UKIP from the Conservative party, said that the PM lost his temper with her, twisting her hand in the process

She claims Mr Cameron, who had been holding her hand, ‘twisted’ it in anger when he heard her news – a claim categorically denied by No 10.

The Prime Minister’s aides could be seen holding Mrs Ayling back as she tried to explain why she was leaving the party.

Speaking afterwards, Mrs Ayling said: ‘His face dropped like a stone, and he couldn’t get away fast enough, twisting my hand in the process.

Senior Conservative sources said that Mrs Ayling is using this as a stunt to garner attention to her defection

‘I hope that it was not deliberate. But he clearly lost his temper.’

A senior Conservative source said last night: ‘There was no physical contact. This was obviously a stunt to get attention for her defection.’
