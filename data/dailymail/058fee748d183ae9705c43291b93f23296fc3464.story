Women in Kuwait could be banned from wearing bikinis after plans were approved to outlaw 'nudity' in public places.

Tourists and residents would be barred from wearing the two-piece swim suit under proposals for a ban at swimming pools and hotels.

The crackdown was approved by the head of the Kuwaiti National Assembly committee, MP Hamdam Al-Azemi.

Al Arabiya News reports that the Islamist lawmaker has not given a definition for the term ‘nudity’ but, according to the Kuwait Times, issued a statement ‘strongly criticising women dressed in bikinis at some swimming pools, on beaches and in hotels’ adding that the term ‘also includes revealing or improper dress’.

The newspaper added that any proposal must be accepted by the government as well as by the Assembly.

A separate proposal to ban bikinis was thrown out by a parliamentary committee as unconstitutional in 2011, the newspaper reports.

It would have meant a ban on revealing bathing suits and clothes with ‘deep cleavage’ at the beach and suggested fines and jail terms of up to a year for offenders.

It comes a day after reports that Qatar has issued a decree advising tourists that leggings are not considered pants and are not modest enough to wear in public.

Leggings have been singled out in pamphlets distributed by the Gulf state as inappropriate attire for tourists in the notoriously strict Islamic country.

The Reflect Your Respect campaign, launched by the Qatar Islamic Cultural Center, has listed some advice and tips for tourists on how to dress modestly in preparation for the 2022 Football World Cup it is hosting.

LEGGINGS ARE NOT PANTS: The Gulf state has issued its stance on leggings as part of its modesty drive

The pamphlets ask visitors to help preserve Qatar's culture and values. They state: 'If you are in Qatar, you are one of us. Please dress modestly in public places.'

It then adds: 'Leggings are not pants.'

The campaign uses social media to help get its message across, including the use of its own Twitter account.

There are a range of other recommendations included in the campaign that visitors need to be wary of if planning to travel to Qatar.

Public displays of intimacy and affection are strongly discouraged in Qatar

The campaign has received a mixed reaction online.

One person responded: 'If this campaign ran in the UK it would be blasted for being "racist". Why is it suddenly acceptable elsewhere, regardless of religious or cultural beliefs? Basic human rights should be accepted globally, not just where some see fit.'
