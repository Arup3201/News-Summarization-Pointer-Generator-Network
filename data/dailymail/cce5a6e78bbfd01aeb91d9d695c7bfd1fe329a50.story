Sportswear guru: Sports Direct owner and Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley

Two thousand shop staff at Sports Direct were celebrating yesterday after landing a shares windfall worth on average more than £43,000 each for beating sales and profits targets.

Sports Direct, founded by former squash coach Mike Ashley 29 years ago, has hit its target for the second year in a row, with profits up 25 per cent for the year ending this April.

This means its staff are set for a shares windfall worth more than twice their average salary of £20,000. 

It is believed to be the largest shares bonanza of its kind ever to be handed out to shop staff in Britain. 

While other high street stores are struggling, the company - whose boss also owns Newcastle United - has surged ahead with its business.

Staff at the discount sportswear chain, which also owns Sports World, Lillywhites and brands including Slazenger, Lonsdale and Dunlop, who are entitled to the share pay-out are those that have been on the payroll for two years. 

Each will receive an average £30,960 share payout, and in addition will net a bonus payout for meeting the previous year’s target, which means they will each pocket an average total of £43,860.

The company’s share price has more than doubled in the past 12 months.  The firm grew its retail sales by 6.6 per cent, with revenues up 10.2 per cent.

The only drawback is that they will have to wait until July next year if they want to cash in their shares. 

The company has revealed underlying profits of £200.4 million in the year until April - topping its target of £195million. 

Mr
Ashley, who set up his first shop in Maidenhead, Berkshire in 1982 and 
now has approximately 350 around the UK, devised the scheme two years 
ago to help improve the chain's trading performance. 

The
company's shares scheme is said to be more generous than those run by 
rival chains such as John Lewis, Tesco and Asda, who offer cash bonuses.

But executives say it is partly the reason why they have become so successful.

Sports Direct’s chief executive, Dave Forsey, told the Independent: ‘This has been an excellent year of growth for the group in what has been a challenging retail environment.

‘Key to this growth has been the success of our employee bonus share scheme, which we introduced to focus on the whole group on our ambitious growth targets.’

An analyst at Singer Capital Markets, Matthew McEachran, said the boost in sales of between £15 million and £20 million in the last year was partly influenced by the World Cup.

Sports Direct plans to open or relocated 15 to 20 outlets over the next year in the UK, including one at the Westfield Shopping Centre in Stratford – conveniently close to the London 2012 Olympic site.

It also currently has eight stores throughout continental Europe and plans to expand that number to 17 within the next five years.

Mike Ashley, a former county squash coach, opened his first sports shop in 1982. Twenty-nine years later, he controls the UK's dominant high street sports retailer.

Although Sports Direct is now a publicly traded company with annual revenues brushing £1.5billion, Ashley still holds around 71 per cent of the stock, making him one of Britain's richest men.

Ashley's rise to wealth has been achieved by a mix of hard work, business acumen, and ruthless operating. As a banker said of him before Sports Direct's debut on the London Stock Exchange: 'He [Ashley] likes to park his tanks on peoples' lawns.'

Ashley's business with a single store in Maidenhead in the early Eighties, trading as Mike Ashley Sports. As the decade progressed, he opened several more sports and ski shops around London, reaching three outlets by 1990.

Funded by the profits from these shops, an injection of private money and a 'pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap philosophy', the chain expanded quickly.

By the end of the Nineties, with 100 UK stores rebranded as Sports Soccer, Ashley finally made the switch from sole trader and incorporated the business as a limited company.

A perennial outsider, in 2000, Ashley turned whistleblower on industry rivals. He handed the Office of Fair Trading evidence of meetings held by sports retailers to fix the price of football shirts.

According to reports, at the meeting Dave Whelan, the founder of JJB Sports, told Ashley: 'There's a club in the north son, and you're not part of it.'

Allsports, JJB, JD Sports and Blacks Leisure were later fined millions by the OFT.

He then embarked on a series of takeovers which shot his business into overdrive. In 2002, he bought prestigious Piccadilly Circus sports shop Lilywhites, and was accused of turning it downmarket.

Uncowed, he moved into sportswear manufacturing two years later, buying Dunlop Slazenger for £40million, closely followed by acquisitions of outdoor gear manufacturer Karrimor, iconic hat maker Kangol, boxing brand Lonsdale and tennis brand Donnay.

His acquisitions, mainly at hefty discounts from distressed buyers, showcased his ruthless business style, but broadened the scope of his sports retail empire.

Deals with Umbro, Matalan, Blacks and even archrival JJB helped Ashley cement the Sports Direct brand and give it a firm foothold in the consciousness of sporting consumers.

Ashley's parent company, Sports World International, finally debuted on the London Stock Exchange on February 27, 2007, valued at £2.5billion.

A year later, it was revealed that Ashley also held a 12 per cent stake in John David Group, parent of JD Sports. He is thought to hold stakes in a number of his rivals.

Last week, Ashley signalled an attempt to take Sports Direct upmarket with an announcement of a tie-up with fashion retail chains USC and Cruise.

The company agreed to take an 80 per cent stake in the chains, run by Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter, for £7million.

Both stores specialise in expensive designer leisure brands like Ugg boots, Adidas Originals and the £300-a-pair True Religion jeans.
