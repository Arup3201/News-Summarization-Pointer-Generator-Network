The Fifty Shades Of Grey trilogy became such a publishing phenomenon that women weren't ashamed to be seen reading the books while commuting or have them proudly on display on their shelves at home.

But the erotic fiction by E L James may never have become so acceptably mainstream if it wasn't for sales first taking off via eBooks.

Launching on this platform gave the novels a massive sales boost with readers who wanted to indulge in the saucy content - but didn't want anyone else to know what they were reading.

Discreet: With an eBook reader, people can download porn and erotic fiction without fear of anyone else knowing

Surge in popularity: The 'Fifty Shades effect' has made erotic fiction more acceptable to read

And now the same effect has led to a boost in popularity in other sexually explicit novels on Amazon - where it seems anything goes from incest to 'monster sex'.

No sneers or leers: EBooks allow readers to buy porn without being embarrassed

And it's not just downloading of the books that has increased, more are being written and shared - many by women using a pseudonym - via Amazon's self-publishing service.Â 

One such writer is 'Venus Santiago' whose titles include 'From Assassin to Sex Slave' and 'Accidental Milkmaid'.

She told The Atlantic that she had to stop buying pornographic books from shops in the Nineties because of the sneers - and leers - of shop assistants. But now she, and other women like her, can read what they please without anyone being any the wiser.

She said: 'The beautiful thing about buying porn on Kindle is that nobody sneers at you. It's just you, Amazon, and your personal mobile device.

'You can read it on the train or subway, at home, wherever, and no one has any idea what you're ogling. Which removes most of the outside negative social pressure that prevents a lot of women who are interested in porn from buying it in the mainstream places.'

While books like Venus's are becoming more popular thanks to the discretion of eBooks, she, and other writers like her, believe their sales would be even higher if Amazon would promote them more.

However, in line with them being seen as a family-friendly, accessible-to-all retailer, the brand are not keen to promote novels of a pornographic nature.

As a result, titles like those written by Venus cannot be found on their homepage or in their 'items to consider' suggestions. They also filter their search function so these books will never appear unless purposefully sought out.

In fact, their rules on self-publishing state that the do not accept any pornographic content at all.

They state on the website: '(We) do not accept pornography or offensive depictions of graphic sexual acts... what we deem offensive is probably about what you would expect.'

This has left writers such as Venus and another under the pseudonym 'Kinukitty' frustrated that their sales could be even higher if promoted more on Amazon.

Self-published porn: Amazon state they do not accept pornography but these are some of the explicit books currently on sale via their website

Kinukitty told The Altlantic: 'Erotica, as a genre, has been Amazon's dirty little secret from the beginning, driving sales of the Kindle to astronomical numbers. Does Amazon really believe that it was all the free copies of 'Huckleberry Finn' and 'Moby Dick' ... that drove readers to buy Kindle devices? Nope, sorry. It was erotica. It was 'porn'.'

However, while the writers may not be happy, The Atlantic argue that it is Amazon's reluctance to embrace and promote the genre that is appealling to porn consumers.

They write: 'Women (and men, too) who want to read porn on the Kindle don't want to be buying their porn from some place that screams porn! Amazon's advantage as a seller of porn is precisely that it sells lots of things that aren't porn, and that it is known primarily for selling things that aren't porn.'
