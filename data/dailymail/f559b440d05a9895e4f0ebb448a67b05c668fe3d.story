Detectives are waiting to interview a 71-year-old man about the murder of a churchwarden who was found strangled at her farmhouse.

The suspect is understood to be the husband of Julia Thurgarland, whose body was found on Friday by paramedics called to her home in Maplebeck, near Southwell, Nottinghamshire.

Nottinghamshire Police said the 71-year-old man was placed under arrest in hospital on Saturday after being found with life-threatening injuries at the farmhouse.

He has yet to be questioned by  officers and remains in a serious but stable condition. Police have not revealed the nature of her husband’s injuries or how they were incurred.

Discovered: Mrs Thurgaland was found dead at her home, in Maplebeck, on Friday

In a statement issued today, the force said: 'Detectives continue to wait this morning to interview a 71-year-old man in connection with the murder of Julia Thurgarland.

'The 71-year-old man, who has been arrested, was found in the house on Friday afternoon suffering from injuries.

'He was taken to Lincoln Hospital, where he remains in a serious but stable condition. Detectives will question the man when he is deemed fit to be interviewed.'

Last night residents spoke of how the 
murder had shaken their community. Mrs Thurgarland was a churchwarden at
St Radegunds Church in Maplebeck, a quiet village of just 96 residents.

Neighbours said she and her husband, who had been married for 46 years, had farmed in the village for decades before retiring.

Retired local vicar Eddie Neale said: 
‘There is an enormous sense of shock, obviously, in the whole village 
and in the wider community that such a thing could happen here.

‘They were much-loved people. He had 
been one of the local farmers here and looked after quite a large area. 
She had been involved in all sorts of organisations around the place.’

Cordon: Police have today continued investigations at the house where Mrs Thurgaland and the injured man were found

Inquiries: Police carrying out the investigation are continuing to appeal for information into the incident

Pillar of the community: Mrs Thurgaland was a churchwarden at St Radegunds Church, in Maplebeck

The couple’s three children – David, 41, Ann, 39, and Jane, 37 – are being supported by specially trained officers.

Prayers were yesterday being said at a
service at the local church. The Reverend Richard Seymour-Whiteley 
said: ‘Our prayers are with them all [the family], along with all those 
who knew Julia well.’

One villager, who did not want to  be 
named, said: ‘We are a very  small and tightknit community. Mrs 
Thurgarland was well known and very popular.’

Another villager added: 
‘The whole village is in shock, it’s just tragic. It’s such a small 
community, everyone knows everyone.’

Maplebeck is situated in the  
mid-Nottinghamshire countryside, near the ancient minster town of 
Southwell. A post-mortem examination found that Mrs Thurgarland had been
strangled.

Commenting on the inquiry, Detective Chief Inspector Tony Heydon, who is leading the investigation, said: 'The inquiries undertaken throughout yesterday make me quite certain this is an isolated incident and we will interview the suspect as soon as possible to determine the circumstances leading up to Mrs Thurgarland’s death.'

Speaking yesterday, the Rev Richard Seymour-Whiteley, the priest-in-charge of a cluster of churches which includes St Radegund, said: 'There has been a tragic incident in Maplebeck in which our churchwarden at Maplebeck, Mrs Julia Thurgarland, has died and her husband is in hospital.

'We wish to respect the family’s privacy at this time and our prayers are with them all, along with all those who knew Julia well.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
