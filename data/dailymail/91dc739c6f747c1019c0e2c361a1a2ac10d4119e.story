Gary Lineker swapped a night of Transfer Deadline Day coverage for a night of glitz and glam with his wife Danielle.

And who can blame him?

The Match of the Day host couldn’t stop smiling as he attended the InStyle and EE Rising Star Party in association with Karen Millen, with his stunning partner at the Ace Hotel on Monday night.

Sky Sports and BT Sport went head-to-head for viewers as transfer moves continued to gain momentum before many came to a shuddering halt.

But Gary’s ear-to-ear smile showed onlookers he was clearly enjoying his decision to have a night on the town.

There was even an appearance from comedian and talk show host Jonathon Ross at the bash as the 54-year-old stole a kiss from Danielle in front of the cameras.

But London born Ross didn’t have it all his own way as Gary photobombed the duo with champagne in hand.
