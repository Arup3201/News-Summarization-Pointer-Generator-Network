Team news

Shrewsbury

Chelsea

Manager Jose Mourinho looks set to ring the changes for Chelsea's visit to  League Two side Shrewsbury in the Capital One Cup.

The likes of Petr Cech, Nathan Ake and Mohamed Salah could feature in the fourth-round tie, but striker Diego Costa, who missed Sunday's game at Manchester United as a result of illness and a hamstring injury, is unlikely to be risked.

Loic Remy (groin), Cesar Azpilicueta and Branislav Ivanovic (both suspended) are unavailable, but midfielder Ramires, who has been out for over five weeks with a groin problem, could return.

Provisional squad: Courtois, Cech, Luis, Fabregas, Zouma, Ake, Oscar, Hazard, Drogba, Mikel, Salah, Matic, Willian, Cahill, Terry, Christensen, Boga, Baker, Schwarzer, Solanke, Ramires.
