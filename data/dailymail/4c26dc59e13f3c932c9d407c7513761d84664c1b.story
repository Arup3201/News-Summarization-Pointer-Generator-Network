According to court documents,  Adrian Peterson may have admitted to smoking marijuana.

The disgraced football star has been forced to undergo drug testing as a condition of his bond in his child abuse case in Texas, and he reportedly informed an employee at the facility during a recent visit that he might not be clean.

He allegedly told the employee that he had recently 'smoke a little weed.'

Poor choice: The Minnesota Vikings running back allegedly made this admission to an employee while undergoing his court-mandated drug test

Now, prosecutors are gunning to throw the Minnesota Vikings running back in jail.

TMZ reports, 'prosecutors say that is a direct violation of the terms of his bond -- and have asked the court to order he be arrested.'

It is uncertain if Peterson would have to fail the test for the prosecutors to follow through on this, or if the admission alone is enough.

The judge is not expected to rule on this matter until next week.

In other news, Peterson was in a Texas courtroom for the first time since being indicted on a felony child abuse charge last month just yesterday.

More troubles: Peterson (above with one of his sons) was in court yesterday to try and get an early hearing date on his upcoming felony child abuse case

Some good news: Peterson (seen yesterday with wife Ashley Brown) secured an early hearing, but this new development could land him in jail regardless 

With his wife Ashley Brown by his side, Peterson's lawyer was able to convince the judge to allow his client an early court date for his upcoming case.

Peterson was hoping this would possibly allow him to get back on the field for the Vikings this season, but should he be arrested for smoking, that could be in jeopardy.

Making matters worse, is how the NFL might respond to this news.

Cleveland Browns player Josh Gordon was suspended for a year after testing positive for smoking marijuana earlier this year, just before the season began.

Peterson has yet to comment on these recent claims.
