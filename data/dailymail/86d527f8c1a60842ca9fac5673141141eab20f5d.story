The victim, Japanese-born Setsuko Itawa, was suffocated with duct tape and hanged from her shower by her builder Toni Hidayat

Indonesian
police today arrested a builder suspected of suffocating a female 
client because he was 'annoyed' at being scolded over his work on 
renovations at her home.

Toni
Hidayat, 39, suffocated 67-year-old Setsuko Itawa with duct tape at her
Jakarta home on Sunday, East Jakarta police chief Saidal Mursalin told 
reporters.

He said 
Japanese-born Itawa was beaten in the face and tied up before being 
dragged to the bathroom and suffocated with duct tape plastered over her
mouth and nose.

'She was 
weak but conscious (after the beating) and then he decided to kill her 
by plastering duct tape over her nose and mouth,' Mursalin said.

'He hanged her from the bathroom shower and then took her mobile phone and bank card before escaping,' he added.

He said Hidayat was doing renovation work on the victim's house.

'He
told us he had murdered the victim because he was annoyed at being 
scolded by her many times for no apparent reason,' Mursalin said.

The
Japanese embassy in Jakarta, where Itawa worked part-time at the 
consular department, said she had given up her Japanese citizenship after 
marrying an Indonesian.

The embassy said it did not know when she had changed her nationality.
