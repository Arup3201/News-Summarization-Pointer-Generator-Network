Criminals are abusing so-called 'right to be forgotten' rules in a bid to cover up their past crimes, it emerged today.

A European court ruling has ordered that search engine Google remove links to webpages which people claim are no longer relevant.

The move - which has seen the company inundated with nearly 100,000 requests to remove search results - has been widely criticised as unacceptable censorship of the internet.

It has now emerged that criminals are exploiting the new rules by lying to Google in a bid to cover up their past wrongdoing.

It has emerged the criminals are abusing so-called 'right to be forgotten rules' to hide their past wrongdoing

The revelation came in a letter from Google lawyer Peter Fleischer to a working party set up by Brussels to police data protection across Europe.

Google is currently looking into requests by  91,000 people across Europe, who want 328,000 allegedly 'irrelevant or outdated' web links removed from the web.

But Mr Fleischer revealed that because Google only have  people's 'take-down requests' to go by, they are only getting one side of the argument.

In the letter, reported by The Times, he wrote: 'Some requests turn out to have been made with false and inaccurate information.

'Even if requesters provide us with accurate information, they understandably may avoid presenting facts that are not in their favour.'

He gives the example of criminals who apply to have links to news reports about their convictions removed, without mentioning they have since committed similar crimes.

The new claims emerged in a letter sent by Google lawyer Peter Fleischer to a Brussels group investigating the fallout of the European Court ruling

News organisations, including MailOnline, have been notified of links to perfectly accurate reports which have been wiped from the internet after applications to Google.

Stories about a Scottish referee who lied about a penalty incident, and an airline accused of racism by a Muslim job applicant were among those censored.

An article about a millionaire banker blamed for helping cause the global financial crisis was among the first to be hidden, because someone was embarrassed about comments they had left at the bottom of the story.

Links to the referee story, which included no suggestion of any criminality, were later reinstated following public pressure.

Astonishingly, the Brussels group monitoring the move has questioned whether news organisations and websites should be informed of the removals at all.

But, in his letter, Mr Fleischer informed them it was essential to ensure the system was not abused.

He gave the example of unscrupulous businesses who may try and get links to their competitors' websites removed so customers can't find them on the internet.

The latest revelations came in the same week that a House of Lords Committee said the new rules were 'unreasonable'.

Baroness Prashar, chair of the Lords Home Affairs EU Sub-Committee, said: 'We also do not believe that individuals should have a right to have links to accurate and lawfully available information about them removed, simply because they do not like what is said.'
