Amazon could be forced to hand over billions in unpaid taxes after the deal it struck with Luxembourg in 2003 was deemed illegal.

The European Commission has ruled the company paid tiny rates of tax in comparison to other organisations in the country, in a way that technically 'constitutes state aid'.

It's particularly embarrassing for the Commission's president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who was Prime Minister of Luxembourg when the  deal was agreed.

The country entered into a number of highly controversial tax deals with multinational firms during his premiership of the Grand Duchy between 1995 and 2013.

Up to 340 multi-national companies were given help to avoid tax during his 18 years in office, it has been alleged. 

The deal between Amazon and Luxembourg regarding how much tax the online retailer should pay was reached after just 11 days - which the Commission deems a 'very short period of time'.

It has previously been accused of minimising tax payments in Britain by diverting revenues through its holding company in Luxembourg, which MPs have branded 'immoral'.

Now it's emerged the company could also be passing money between companies registered inside Luxembourg to bring down its own tax bill within the country.

The commission said that Amazon had been allowed to funnel profits between holding companies, resulting in a tax bill of almost nothing.

Amazon has several weeks to reply to the ruling and an eventual fine could be more than a year away because of the lengthy process and discussions between the company, EU regulators and the Luxembourg government. 

Juncker has been further weakened by claims that he acted like a 'business partner' to the US company.

Amazon's former head of tax, Bob Comfort, has reportedly said  the Luxembourg government 'helped solve problems' for the company, to smooth its passage when originally setting up its operation in the country. 

In order to minimise its tax payments in the UK and across Europe, Amazon has based its headquarters in the Grand Duchy where it operates a skeleton crew of around 1,000 staff.

It deems this as the 'beating heart' of its operation, even though it has warehouses and employs more than 15,000 workers in Britain alone.

Tax accountant Richard Murphy at Tax Research UK said: ‘Amazon is at a significant financial risk and it is possible that the eventual bill could run into billions.’

He added: ‘There’s a real prospect that Amazon will end up paying more tax in the UK if international law changes come in.’ 

Amazon paid just £42million in corporation tax in UK last year,despite sales of around £4.3billion.

Tax accountant Richard Murphy at Tax Research UK said: 'Amazon is at a significant financial risk and it is possible that the eventual bill could run into billions.

'There's a real prospect that Amazon will end up paying more tax in the UK if international law changes come in.'

The investigation is part of a multi-pronged clampdown on international tax-dodging by the commission.

It is investigating similarly 'sweetheart' deals done by Google in Ireland, Starbucks in the Netherlands and Fiat in Luxembourg.

The OCED is investigating ways to update international tax rules to take account of internet companies, which have been accused of using loopholes in existing legislation to avoid taxes by basing themselves in offshore havens. 

A spokesman for Amazon has said: 'Amazon has received no special tax treatment from Luxembourg - we are subject to the same tax laws as other companies operating here.'

According to the Financial Times, Luxembourg said it was 'confident that the allegations of state aid in this case are unsubstantiated'.
