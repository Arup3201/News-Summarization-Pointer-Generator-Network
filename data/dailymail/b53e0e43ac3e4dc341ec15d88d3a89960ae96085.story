At 16 her gangly beauty saw her become the face of the 1960s.

Fifty years on, Twiggy’s still very much in fashion.

At 65, the model and Marks & Spencer designer has been named as the latest ambassador for L’Oreal.

This time her enviable blonde locks will be the focus of the adverts for the brand’s Professionnel line of hair products.

Her appointment comes after the French cosmetics giant signed up Dame Helen Mirren, 69, as a representative on a reported £9million deal in October last year. Jane Fonda, 77, has also fronted the company’s campaigns.

Actresses Jennifer Lopez, 45, and Andie MacDowell, 56, have also represented the more mature woman.

However, much younger celebrities usually star in L’Oreal commercials, such as pop star Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, 31, and actress Blake Lively, 27.

And, at 65, she is more than twice the age of other celebrity representatives Cheryl and Blake. 

Twiggy said: ‘I am absolutely delighted. I truly believe in the skill of the professional hairdresser and am so proud to represent the brand.

'I hope to inspire women to be confident in their personal style and never to be afraid of trying something new.

It is not Twiggy’s first signing for a cosmetics company – she has also been the face of skincare brand Olay.

Twiggy was first recruited by M&S to front an ad campaign in 2005 and has also turned her hand to designing her own collections.  

Twiggy, born Lesley Hornby but given her nickname for her slender build, was one of the world’s first supermodels appearing on the cover of British Vogue and Elle in the 60s.

She has also appeared in a number of movies including The Boy Friend (1971) and was briefly a co-presenter of ITV’s This Morning in 2001. 

Talking about being the face of the Sixties at 16, she told an interviewer: ‘The thing is, when you’re 16, you don’t feel young. 

'At the time you think you’re quite grown up. 

'It wasn’t until much later, when I had a daughter and she got to be 16, that I looked at her and thought, “Oh my God, I was that young when it happened”. 

'It’s amazing, really, that I didn’t go stark raving bonkers.’
