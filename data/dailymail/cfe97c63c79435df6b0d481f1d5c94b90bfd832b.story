In its day, it was seen as a celebration of multiculturalism and racial harmony.

But when a BBC DJ played Blue Mink’s 1969 hit Melting Pot he admitted beforehand its lyrics might now be seen as inappropriate

BBC Three Counties Radio presenter Iain Lee warned listeners: ‘I think it might be a little bit racist now.’

But less than half a minute into the song, after hearing the words ‘yellow Chinkees’ he stopped the track and apologised, adding: ‘At least we know you cannot play that song any more. It’s a different world.’

Listeners heard only the first six lines of Melting Pot: ‘Take a pinch of white man, wrap him up in black skin, add a touch of blue blood and a little bitty bit of Red Indian boy. Curly Latin kinkies, mixed with yellow Chinkees...’

They did not hear the chorus, which includes the lines: ‘What we need is a great big melting pot. Big enough to take the world and all it’s got.’

In 1969, the song was seen as a statement against racial intolerance by a five-piece British band fronted by black American singer Madeline Bell.

It reached No 3 in the singles chart and spent 15 weeks in the Top Ten. There have been several cover versions but the most recent, by Boyzone in 1996, changed ‘yellow Chinkees’ to ‘Oriental sexy’.

Good intentions: Pop act Blue Mink (pictured) said racial integration was a 'beautiful dream' 

Mr Lee’s producer told him she had not checked the lyrics before he played it on Three Counties, which covers Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire.

After stopping the track, he said: ‘I humbly apologise. The intention was good, the way it was phrased was very poor. If anyone was offended by that you have my sincerest apologies.

‘You know it’s not our intention to offend anybody on this show.’

Mr Lee had to apologise in August after he told his producer to ‘go and do the black and Asian show’ during a pretend on-air row. The BBC described the exchange as banter, but said the comments were unacceptable.

Yesterday the BBC said Melting Pot had been played shortly after 8.50am on Friday after it was mentioned during an on-air discussion about the impact of immigration on the NHS.

A spokesman added: ‘It was clearly not played to cause offence. The production team have been reminded of their responsibilities to ensure this doesn’t happen again.’

The programme, including the song, was still available to listen to on iPlayer yesterday.

Ofcom said that if it receives a complaint it will see if broadcasting rules were broken.

The regulator’s website states that ‘Chink’ is a ‘term of racial offence/abuse’.

Last April veteran BBC Radio Devon DJ David Lowe lost his job after playing a 1932 version of The Sun Has Got His Hat On, unaware that it included the N-word. He was later offered his job back but declined.
