It's been a tough autumn for England but I am delighted and much encouraged that they saved their best for last and emerged as convincing winners in what, let’s face it, was a must-win game.

If Stuart Lancaster’s men continue to play to their strengths and improve, they are going to be a massively difficult team to beat at Twickenham in the World Cup.

With that pack at full tilt, nobody is going to relish playing them and they need to show that again when they next pull on the white shirt, against Wales in Cardiff in their next fixture on February 6. What an interesting Friday night that will be.

Brad Barritt: I’ve always seen Brad Barritt as an inside centre but I thought he was magnificent at 13 on Saturday and his bloodied face summed up England’s effort. On days when they are playing a more limited game-plan, he can be very effective indeed at outside centre.

Make no mistake, the pressure was on England on Saturday and pretty much across the board everybody stepped up to the plate.

It wasn’t always pretty but wins against world-class rugby sides aren’t always things of beauty. It was, however, a very well thought out and crafted performance and England made sure they played to their strengths for as long as possible.

The single biggest improvement from the New Zealand, South Africa and Samoa matches was in England’s kicking game, which was unrecognisable from earlier this month.

England were intelligent. George Ford enjoyed another fine game and kicked well while Ben Youngs really came to the party, launching a number of high balls and box kicks landing just outside the 22 or deliberately keeping the ball in play to maintain pressure on Australia.

There was even at least one good old fashioned ‘up and under’. Execute them well and they always cause problems. This much improved kicking was backed up by a well organised kick-chase game with Jonny May and Anthony Watson using their pace to hound the Wallabies and challenge for the high ball. If you do those basics exceptionally well you are always going to give yourself a chance.

England must not rest on their laurels here. Their kicking game earlier this month was very poor and they need to reproduce Saturday’s quality on a regular basis. They need to fully appreciate that a complete kicking game is an important attacking weapon, not a negative tactic.

It was a pretty impressive defensive effort as well because Australia, who badly needed a win themselves, definitely turned up to play and there is no more dangerous back division in world rugby when they go hunting for tries.

The official stats show that England made 158 tackles to Australia’s 48 and though I don’t remember them being under the pump to quite that extent, a stack of tackling had to be done at key times.

We saw the true value of Brad Barritt in organising the defensive line behind the scrum and with the way he put his body on the line. The Saracen centre had one of his finest Test displays and though midfield is clearly an area where England have yet to find a settled combination he stated his case strongly.

Elsewhere, it’s difficult to look beyond the England pack. They have been formidable over the past four weekends and it is worth emphasising they were unable to consider six Lions forwards from 2013 - Alex Corbisiero, Tom Youngs, Dan Cole, Mako Vunipola, Geoff Parling and Tom Croft. I also consider Joe Launchbury to be right up there in terms of quality.

I am a great believer in not making injury excuses - go with your best available team and get judged from that. But what a strong position to be in come the Six Nations if four or five of those are fit again. This pack will only get stronger and should give England a rock solid foundations going forward.

WINNERS 

1) JOE MARLER (PROP)

Has come of age this November and stormed through four tough Tests with flying colours. Strong scrummager, good around the park. Still young but Quins captaincy has matured him.

Joe Marler (centre) impressed for England this autumn and has really improved and matured

2) GEORGE FORD (FLY HALF)

Along with Danny Cipriani, the best attacking option England have at fly-half. Has made a very accomplished start. Needs to build on that - beginning against Wales in Cardiff.

Ford (left) has established himself as one of the most exciting No 10s in England right now

3) BEN MORGAN (NO 8)

Missed out initially to Billy Vunipola but has taken his chances well. Morgan is a big and dangerous ball carrier who knows where the try-line is and now fit enough to make that count for 80 minutes.

Morgan was extremely impressive and is a very dangerous ball carrier for England 

LOSERS 

1) OWEN FARRELL (FLY HALF)

I’m a big Farrell fan, I love his abrasiveness and big-match goal-kicking - but he is a 12 now for England. Didn’t look match-fit going into the autumn and maybe shouldn’t have been picked. 

Owen Farrell (right) has been out of form and low on fitness and is now a No 12 option for England

2) DANNY CARE (SCRUM HALF)

Still one of the best two scrum-halves in England but took a backward step this month. Must get back into the groove with Quins and ‘go again’. At his best, an important player for England. 

Danny Care is still one of the best two scrum halves in England but he needs to find his form again

3) BILLY VUNIPOLA (NO 8)

A considerable talent but not fit and fast enough yet to make an impact at elite level. England’s backrow lacks a little pace and they can not afford another slow unit. Must work on his conditioning. 

Billy Vunipola has lost his place in the England side and needs to improve his fitness to get it back
