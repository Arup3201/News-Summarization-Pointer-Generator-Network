It sounds like a job for Larry the Downing Street cat - or maybe not.

Just two days after reports of a lion on the loose in Essex, commuters at one London Underground station have been warned about a gang of rampaging mice which have apparently been 'attacking' their feet as they wait for trains.

The problem has got so bad that a message appeared on a whiteboard at Farringdon Station yesterday urging passengers to 'tuck the bottom of their trousers into their socks'.

The sign, handwritten on a whiteboard in black pen, informed passengers of the 'attacks' and said they should 'avoid being a victim'.

Warning: TfL says the sign was not written by any of its staff and it's believed to be a joke by a member of the public urging passengers to 'avoid being a victim'

It comes as David Cameron's cat Larry caught his first ever rodent today - more than a year 
after the five-year-old moggie was brought into help curb the mouse 
problem at No 10.

The reluctant mouser was finally spotted playing 
with the dead mouse this morning before 
he proudly dumped its body on the grass.

However, the problem at Farringdon station could be too big a challenge for Larry, who, like his owner, is known to enjoy long periods of time 'chill-axing' instead of stalking the corridors of power for vermin.

This afternoon Transport for London, which is in charge of the station, denied any of its staff wrote the note.

A spokesman said: 'It wasn't a TfL message, it's been removed and we don't believe it was written by a member of TfL staff.

'We are not aware of any mice at the station.'

The spokesman said the sign was removed overnight.

However,
it still raised a few eyebrows among passengers who spotted the sign and posted pictures of it on Twitter. It has now been
viewed by thousands of people.

packet of mini cheddars as mouse bait #Farringdonmice'

Another Twitter user said: 'Hey, it would be worse. There could be a lion on the loose.'Â
