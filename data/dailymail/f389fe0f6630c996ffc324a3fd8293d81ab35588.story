Practicing in a pink t-shirt emblazoned with the slogan ‘One Hot Drop Shot’ it’s clear to see how Eugenie Bouchard is making an impression at Wimbledon.

The 20-year-old is named after a princess and is fast becoming the queen of Centre Court.

She is now in with a genuine chance of winning the women’s singles as existing Wimbledon royalty are guillotined in rapid succession.

With model good looks, the 20-year-old Canadian is named after a princess and is fast becoming the queen of Centre Court

The Canadian had expected to face her childhood heroine Maria Sharapova in the quarter finals, but the former champion suffered a surprise defeat in the fifth round following earlier upsets for top two seeds, Serena Williams and Li Na.

Instead Miss Bouchard, whose namesake is Princess Eugenie, spent yesterday on the practice court  on the All England Club preparing for her match against German ninth seed for a place in the final four.

And Miss Bouchard said she is relishing the chance to wow the Wimbledon crowds again in the country she considers her second home.

Her parents named all their children after royalty – her twin sister is Beatrice and she has a brother called William.

She said: 'Maybe it looks like my parents were royal obsessed, it makes me feel a little bit more at home in England among my fellow royals.

'When I was young my Mum gave me a magazine with the two princesses in it and I still keep it on my bedside table, my brother is Prince William. I think they are just nice names that they liked.'

This week she performed in front of royalty as she appeared under the Centre Court roof in front of a Royal Box boasting the Duke of Kent and the Countess of Wessex.

And she confesses to certain airs and graces befitting her name.

'I can be a princess. I can be moody in the morning and my fitness trainer carries my tennis bag around, ‘ she said.

'But that's so I don't get tired because I want to save all my energy for the match.

‘I can demand a few things once in a while, but I do it with love.'

With her Hollywood looks and dazzling skills, even before her appearance at this year’s tournament she had attracted a worldwide fan base knows as the 'Genie Army'.

At other tournaments the adoring supporters throw cuddly toys at her, although she says Wimbledon spectators are ‘too proper’ to behave that way.

Miss Bouchard is rumoured to be in a romance with Canadian ice hockey star Alex Galchenyuk, but keeps her tennis contemporaries at a distance.

She was close to British star Laura Robson, but it has cooled recently and Miss Bouchard said last month: ‘I don’t think the tour is the place to have friends.’

It is a clear sign of the single minded determination of the young woman who started playing tennis aged five in the English speaking Montreal suburb of West Mount.

She said: 'Ever since I was young, whatever I did I wanted to do it to the best of my abilities.

'When I came home from school I would be the one doing my homework while my siblings would be watching TV and putting it off until later.

‘I was always very determined, and to excel at this sport you have to be really disciplined and motivated.

'I asked my parents if I could play more so they put me in groups where there was more actual tennis and it went from there.

‘Nine is very young to decide what you want to do in life but that is pretty much when I decided.'

'Meanwhile my twin retired at age six. We are very close but opposite in many ways. I never needed to be pushed.'

He's coaching top seed Novak Djokovic, but it looks like Boris Becker may have cut back on his own training.

The ex-Wimbledon champion looked a tad portly on the practice courts yesterday – and committed a fashion faux pas by teaming black socks with white trainers.
