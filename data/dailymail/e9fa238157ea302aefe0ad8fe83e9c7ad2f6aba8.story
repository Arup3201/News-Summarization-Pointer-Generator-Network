Rev Al Sharpton was in an oversharing mood Wednesday when he denied fathering the troubled teenage son of a prominent City Hall official who had worked for him in the past.

Sharpton made the unprompted remarks during a press conference about his tax debt troubles.

A report published by the New York Times suggested that the 60-year-old Mr Sharpton and his non-profit businesses owed as much as $4.5mllion to the Internal Revenue Service in unpaid state and federal taxes.

After blasting the Times' front-page piece about his financial foibles as 'misleading' because it failed to emphasize that much of that figure stems from penalties and back taxes that are steadily being paid down as part of settlement, Sharpton unexpectedly brought up Rachel Noerdlinger.

Noerdlinger, 44, the chief of staff to Mayor Bill de Blasio's wife, announced Tuesday that she would be taking time off following the Friday night arrest of her 17-year-old son, Khari, on a trespassing charge.

The civil rights activist and MSNBC host, who is married with two children, told the assembled reporters that he has reached out to Ms Noerdlinger, his former press secretary, to talk to her about her son.

'I’m concerned, I watched him grow up,’ Sharpton said, according to the New York Post.

‘Ironically, about eight months ago, a reporter was running around trying to prove that I was Khari’s father. You remember that.

Off topic: Sharpton made the comments about Noerdlinger, his former employee, while addressing his alleged IRS troubles concerning $4.5million in liens  

‘We’ve been through all of this before. I’ve gone from you know being too close to politicians, to being too close to entertainers and people’s father that I’m not.’ 

After Sharpton's news conference at the National Action Network headquarters, Ms Noerdlinger sent the New York Daily News an email saying that she first met Rev Sharpton only in January 1999.

'Khari Noerdlinger was born on December 20, 1996,' she noted.

On Monday, Ms Noerdlinger, a single mother, announced she would be taking a leave of absence after Khari was arrested for allegedly trespassing in a building which is known as a drug hot spot in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan.

He was apprehended with three friends, two of whom were in possession of small amounts of marijuana, law enforcement sources said.

The indefinite leave from her $170,000-a-year job is unpaid, according to a City Hall source, reports the New York Post.  It wasn't immediately clear when, or if, Noerdlinger would return.

'Today I am announcing that I have decided to take a leave of absence to spend more time with my son,' Noerdlinger said in a statement.

'These past two months have been extremely difficult for both of us, and his arrest on Friday heightens the need for me to devote my full attention to Khari, my number one priority.'

She added that her son 'has been subjected to attacks' which she said had nothing to do with 'public interest, and everything to do with derailing this administration.

In response to her statement, Rebecca Katz, a special adviser to Mayor de Blasio said: 'The Mayor and first lady thank Rachel for her service.'

'She has been a great asset to the administration and the people of New York City over the past year, and everyone wishes her all the best during her leave.'

Khari, who made headlines recently after he posted explicit messages about cops and women on his Twitter page, was taken to court on Saturday - a day after his mother's 44th birthday.

'While he is still a teen, he is entering into adulthood, and he must take responsibility for his actions,' Noerdlinger said in a statement. 

'This issue is now a family matter that we will address privately at home.' 

Noerdlinger has been in a serious relationship with ex-convict Hassaun McFarlan, 36, since 2010.

Last month, he sparked a controversy after reportedly leaving explicit comments on a hip-hop blog touting his love for violent sex. 

McFarlan's criminal history includes drug-trafficking and driving offenses, and in September he was linked to distasteful and explicit posts on a music blog, in which he allegedly solicited women to talk about violent sex with him.

The comments, posted on the Hip Hop News 24-7 blog, asked female users whether they are 'turned on when a man plays rough with you'. the New York Post reported.

Another post complained about the sexual abilities of black women.

It said: 'Trying to find the right black woman with a mean [sex act] game is like trying to find a black woman with good credit.'

The words were posted in 2011 under the pseudonym 'stop end frisk'. 

They have since been deleted but can be seen in search engine data for old versions of the pages.

Noerdlinger has denounced the comments - which she acknowledged as coming from her boyfriend - describing them as 'reprehensible'.

The chief of staff joined Mayor de Blasio's team in January as an aide to Chirlene McCray, and has attended high-level NYPD meetings. This has raised some eyebrows given her live-in partner's attitude towards police, whom he has described as 'pigs'.

His criminal past, dredged up recently by DNAInfo, goes back to his first arrest at age 15 for shooting to death an older boy in a dispute over a goose-down jacket in Harlem.

Most recently, he got in trouble with the law last year when he nearly ran over a New Jersey state police officer while driving his girlfriend's Mercedes-Benz, according to court records obtained by the news site.

Two of McFarlan's five arrests on charges ranging from driving on a suspended license to drug trafficking took place while he was dating Rachel Noerdlinger.

The 43-year-old chief of staff got her start as a publicist representing attorney Johnnie Cochran and prominent civil rights leader Rev Al Sharpton, who later hired her as a public relations adviser for his organization the National Action Network.

All the while, Noerdlinger's live-in boyfriend has been raving against police officers on social media.

In one post, which has since been removed along with McFarlan's Facebook account, he reportedly wrote: 'I cant come outside without the pigs f***ing with me in the hood.'

When asked whether the bombshell revelations could result in her dismissal, de Blasio's spokeswoman Rebecca Katz said: 'Rachel's not going anywhere.'

Katz, however, pointed out that 'no one at city Hall condones criminal behavior or disparagement of the NYPD, including Rachel.'

The spokeswoman went on to say that Ms Noerdlinger, a single mother of one, was 'a strong and independent woman' whose core values and believes are in line with the de Blasio administration.

Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch, however, expressed concern regarding Noerdlinger's access to sensitive police information and called into question the aide's judgement.

'It raises serious questions about her judgment and character and the quality of the counsel she provides to City Hall,' he told the Post. 'She should not be in that position.'

Attorney Jeffrey Lichtman, who represents Hassaun McFarlan and Rachel Noerdlinger, hit out at her critics saying that she performs her duties as a chief of staff without any input from her boyfriend.

'To her credit, she's a loyal woman and a strong woman and she would not put her career ahead of people she cares about,' said Lichtman.

When approached over the comments, McFarlan refused to respond.
