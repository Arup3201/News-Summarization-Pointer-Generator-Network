For a man so incredibly quick with his feet, Jefferson Montero was hardly rushing to follow his father into the family business.

Banana farming in the plantation surrounding his home in Ecuador was one outcome he desperately wanted to avoid. ‘It’s hard, hard work,’ says the Swansea winger. ‘Long days and hard. For sure, that would be me now if I did not play football.

‘I worked in the farms for a while but I was lazy. I just wanted to play football. Always, all I wanted was football.’

Jefferson Montero is one of 41 players, coaches and directors named in a match-fixing investigation in Spain, relating to a fixture between Levante and Real Zaragoza in 2011. 

Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera is also among the players named. 

A Swansea spokesman said: ‘We have had no contact from any authority regarding this matter.’ 

It’s what he would say to the teachers who confronted him over his truancy. And to one of his early clubs, which he left after four days because they insisted on 5am alarm calls to kick-start a series of daily chores. It’s also what he said to the numerous suggestions that he was just too small to be any good.

‘I had the same hormone treatment as Lionel Messi when I was young,’ Montero says. ‘I’d probably be 10cm smaller if I didn’t.’

At 5ft 7ins and 25 years old, the little boy from Ecuador has grown up in a number of ways.

Going into Saturday’s match against Hull, Montero has emerged as one of Swansea’s biggest threats. His demolition of Calum Chambers was central to Arsenal’s defeat at the Liberty Stadium last month; his match-up against Everton’s Tony Hibbert in September’s Capital One Cup fixture was even more one-sided.

There were also prolonged moments against Crystal Palace’s Joel Ward, QPR’s Nedum Onuoha and Tottenham’s Kyle Walker when the first impression was underlined — he is a fantastically entertaining left winger who, on form, can turn games. His deliveries require work, but his pace, feints and flair make him one of the most effective dribblers in the Premier League.

The statistics show he has four assists in 11 starts — most recently against West Ham this month — and on average will beat a man three times a game, the sixth highest tally in the Premier League behind Eden Hazard.

It is why he has seemingly overtaken Nathan Dyer in the Swansea pecking order in the past six weeks and why, in Ecuador, they call him ‘Turbine’.

‘I have always liked to run at defenders,’ Montero says. ‘It is a part of the game I love. My family name is Montero, my mother’s name is Mercedes so some people at home call me a Ferrari. That makes me laugh.’

Home for Montero is Babahoyo, a city of 153,000 people in the centre of Ecuador. Agriculture is the main industry and bananas are the family trade.

His house is down a long, narrow dirt path in the heart of one of the plantations. ‘I come from a very modest family,’ Montero says, speaking via a translator in his first major interview in Britain. ‘My family have always worked really hard. They have always worked in agriculture. My dad was on the farm and my mother was in the home.

‘I have a brother and a sister but they don’t play football. My dad used to play with me when I was little and he tells me his father used to play for Barcelona in Ecuador.

‘In school all I wanted was football. I used to get grants for schooling because of my football in the local teams, but I used to turn up maybe 10 days per month and the teachers would get unhappy and say, “Stop playing all this football. You need to study because football is not going to give you anything”.

‘I used to pass every year but football was what I wanted. I watched football whenever I could — I used to like Arsenal. Robert Pires was my favourite.

‘My dad used to support me. My mum was complaining that I shouldn’t choose football but I always wanted to play only football.’

It was that mindset that led him to quit a club as a 16-year-old. ‘I was at a team in Ecuador and they used to wake up at 5am to work and only afterwards would we play football,’ he says. ‘We would spend hours cleaning. After four days I told them I was leaving and I went to Emelec, a big team in Ecuador.

‘It is a big rival of Barcelona, who my dad supports. He said: “Do not go there” but when I was 16 I realised I could do something with football.’

From Emelec, Montero joined Independiente in the Ecuadorian second division and then went on loan to a Mexican side before heading for Villarreal in Spain in 2009.

‘In my first-team debut, I came on as a substitute for Pires. I used to watch him so closely and then I was coming on for him. It was very strange but amazing.

‘I also played with Santi Cazorla for a couple of years and I never knew what foot was his strong foot. He was amazing with both.’

Montero went on loan to Levante and Real Betis before joining Morelia in Mexico in 2012 and almost headed to a different part of Wales a year later.

‘I was close to joining Cardiff,’ he says. ‘I was desperate to come to the Premier League but everything happens for a reason. Maybe the reason was I had to be at Swansea.

‘I am grateful Cardiff wanted to sign me. It was not a decision from me (to turn Cardiff down) and I don’t think it was a decision from Cardiff. It was a decision from my ex-agent.’

Montero stayed in Mexico and went on to start all three of Ecuador’s World Cup games before finally getting his move to the Premier League for £4m this summer.

‘Antonio Valencia from Manchester United told me this was the best league and I love it,’ he says.

‘After going to the World Cup as well I would say this is maybe my best year. I play great players every week. (Pablo) Zabaleta was probably the hardest full back – he was very clever.

‘I have been able to help my family which has always been my dream. My father doesn’t have to work any more.’

The banana industry’s loss has been Swansea’s gain.
