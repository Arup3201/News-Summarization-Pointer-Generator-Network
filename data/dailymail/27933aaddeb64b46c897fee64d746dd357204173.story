A mother-of-three who fell into the path of a van following a row with another woman outside the school gates has now died. 

Robyn McHale, 28, was airlifted to hospital after she fell in front of the van outside Forres Primary School in Hoddeson in Hertfordshire. 

Friends and relatives have claimed that Miss McHale, a former beauty queen, had previously complained she was being bullied outside the school gates. 

Miss McHale suffered head injuries after the accident and was airlifted to the Royal London Hospital last Monday afternoon.

Dean Patient, chief inspector for Broxbourne, said at the time they had been 'aware of a brief exchange between the injured woman and another woman'.

He said: 'This will be an extremely difficult time for the woman's family and friends and our thoughts are with them.

'An investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident was undertaken and this has now been reviewed by detectives from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit.

'Following this investigation and review, the two people arrested yesterday, a woman and a teenage girl, will face no further action as there is no evidence to suggest that the two arrested have any criminal liability for what happened.'
