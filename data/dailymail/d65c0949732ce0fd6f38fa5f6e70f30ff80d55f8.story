A former record-breaking athlete was forced into prostitution by a lesbian madam who ran a 'ruthless' sex ring in London, a court has heard.

The Bulgarian woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, sobbed as she told a jury how she came to Britain for a 'better life' but was made to work for a ‘high class’ escort agency.

Tatiana Shmyrova, 45, exploited the former runner after she had a holiday romance with her son Artyom, Southwark Crown Court heard.

After she was encouraged to come the UK and promised a 'well paid' job as a tour guide, the group took her money and forced her into prostitution, it was alleged.

Shmyrova is said to have advertised the 
sex workers on a website operated by Natalia Cannon and her estranged 
husband William, 52, who used the earnings to fund a lavish lifestyle.

The ring is said to have included Michael Poole, pictured, who was hired by Shmyrova as a 'fixer' to ensure that prostitutes were ready and willing to carry out clients' demand, the court heard

The ring is said to have included Michael
 Poole, 28, who was hired by Shmyrova as a ‘fixer’ to ensure that 
prostitutes were ready and willing to carry out clients’ demands.

Giving evidence from behind a screen, the Bulgarian woman who had been a promising athlete securing a national long distance record as a teenager said: 'When Artyom started to talk about London, I said I never wanted to work as a prostitute.

'For me, it is not important to have money and all those things like that, I prefer to have a normal job, so I can feel proud in myself, not feel ashamed in myself like now.'

The woman, 34, told the court that before her flight in November 2012, she gave all her money including her savings to her lover Artyom.

She said: 'He said I don't need any money when I come here, so when I arrived in London I did not have a penny even - I was vulnerable.

'I was scared, I didn't know what is going to happen because he did not explain anything to me.

'I told him many times I am not going to work that kind of job. I repeated that many, many times. I remember, I will never forget that.'

On the profits of the sex ring Natalia Cannon indulged in shopping binges at Harrods, splashing out on designer brands such as Versace and Prada, as well as Cartier jewellery, the court heard.

The 34-year-old, who is accused of conspiracy to control prostitution for gain, also lived in a £1.5million Chelsea Harbour apartment that she rented for £2,200-a-month.

Russian-born Shmyrova was said to be a central part of the lucrative business that ‘bartered in human beings and human bodies’.

She housed sex workers in a number of leased properties, using a network of employees to organise the ‘prostitutes’ diaries and lives’.

One such colleague was her ‘partner in love and work’, Irina Bespalova, 32, who arranged photo shoots of the working girls.

The madam used the internet to advertise the sex workers, having arrangements in place with a number of websites, including the Cannons’s site.

Southwark Crown Court heard that those 
involved in the sex ring were behind a conspiracy to traffic women to 
the UK from countries such as Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Russia.

A boarding school-educated Bulgarian woman, 34, who was told that she would be ‘working in a legitimate job’ after moving to the UK, is one of the group’s alleged trafficking victims.

The 34-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was a promising athlete as a teenager and secured a national athletics record aged just 16.

Having passed up the opportunity to train in America, she finished her studies at home but fell into debt after breaking her leg and struggling to pay for treatment.

Shmyrova’s son Artyom , who is believed to be residing in Russia, convinced the woman to move to the UK after they enjoyed a holiday romance in Bulgaria, it was claimed.

The woman was ‘excited by the prospect of coming to London’, believing she would be working as a tour guide, but was eventually ‘pushed into prostitution’.

Prosecutor Riel Karmy-Jones said: ‘She was told that she would be working in a legitimate job, that she would be well paid, well treated and looked after.

‘She was persuaded by promises that it would change her life for the better.

‘However when she arrived, she found herself in the hands of people who operate a network of so called ‘high class’ escort agencies across London, mainly based in Kensington and Chelsea, Mayfair and other affluent areas.

Shmyrova, who lives in a gated residential block in Fulham, South West London, is said to have taken 50 per cent of the girls’ earnings, as well as charging them rent and a fee for being driven to hotels by chauffeurs.

Describing Shmyrova as a ‘modern day madam’, Miss Karmy-Jones said: ‘She lives her life through prostitution – but organising prostitutes through largely the mechanism of the internet.

‘This was not an insignificant enterprise, and she also employed others to do this work - fixers to assist with the controlling of prostitutes diaries and lives.’

Co-defendants Ryzard Goreki, 37, was employed as a driver while Jerzy Molczun, 26, worked as a receptionist and ‘heavy’, jurors heard. 

The alleged sex ring was exposed after police launched an undercover sting in February last year.

Miss Karmy Jones said: ‘This case involves a sustained conspiracy, or agreement, to traffic a young woman, for the purposes of exploitation, namely to use her as a prostitute in this country.

‘The rationale behind this is an obvious one - to make money for those involved in this enterprise, including these four defendants, who the Crown say ruthlessly pursued that objective, without any thought for those they exploited to get it.’

Shmyrova, Natalia Cannon and William Cannon all deny conspiracy to traffic persons into the United Kingdom for sexual exploitation.

Both Cannons and Michael Poole deny conspiracy to control prostitution for gain, while Natalia Cannon denies possessing £13,899.79 in criminal property and a further count of failing to comply with a disclosure in relation to a four digit code for an Apple iPad.

Bespalova, Gorecki and Molczun have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to control prostitution for gain and will be sentenced at the conclusion of the trial.

The trial continues.
