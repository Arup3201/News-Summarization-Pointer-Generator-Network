Princess Diana was 'uneducated' and the older royals are 'boring' according to Princess Michael of Kent. 

The astonishing outburst happened during an interview with disgraced newspaper tycoon Conrad Black - who used to own the Chicago Sun-Times and was jailed in the United States for fraud - to promote her new book on Canadian TV.  

Princess Michael, who celebrated her 69th birthday recently, is dubbed Princess Pushy.

The interview began with the Princess saying she could not talk about Britain's Royal Family. 

But when asked about William and Kate, she said: 'Of course we're thrilled to have a beautiful young married couple with a baby.

'Let's hope there are more marriages soon because I think to have that young generation is terribly good for the people. 

'The people love to see happy young people and I think the older generation are a bit boring for most people.'

Black then quizzed her about Princess Diana. 

She said: 'She was my next door neighbour at Kensington Palace and I must say I was very fond of her, very attached to her.

She had an enormous amount of goodness in her.

Controversial: Princess Diana was 'uneducated' and the older royals are 'boring' according to Princess Michael of Kent (pictured)

'Like probably many people of little education who find themselves, like pop stars or film stars, suddenly lauded by the whole world, it is very difficult if you have not had a mother bringing you up who was quite stern and strict.

'She did not have a mother bring her up and she did not have much education, so it is much harder to cope with eulogy.'

Princess Diana became a nursery teacher after leaving school with no O-levels.

Princess Michael, a divorcee from Bohemia, married the Queen's cousin Prince Michael in 1978.

She is the author of a number of books including her latest historical novel The Queen of Four Kingdoms.

However, her comments have sparked outrage however among royal circles.

Lady Colin Campbell, the royal biographer, described the remarks as 'rubbish'. 

While Ashley Walton, co-author of Prince Philip: Wise Words And Golden Gaffes, told the Sunday Express: 'Philip is 93 this year but he is anything but boring.

'In many ways he and the Queen are far more interesting than the younger royals because of what they have experienced in their long lives.'

Black, a convicted felon in the U.S., was perhaps a curious choice to conduct the interview.

The Canadian-born 69-year-old controlled Hollinger 
International, once the world's third-largest English-language newspaper
 empire, which published the Chicago Sun Times, other major 
international titles such as The Daily Telegraph in the UK and hundreds of community newspapers in North 
America.

In
 2004, a shareholder-initiated prosecution of Black began in the U.S. 
over $80 million in assets claimed to have been improperly taken 
or inappropriately spent by Black.

He
 was convicted of three counts of fraud and one count of obstruction of 
justice in a U.S. court in 2007 and sentenced to six and a half years' 
imprisonment.

In 2011,
 two of the charges were overturned on appeal, and he was re-sentenced 
to 42 months in prison on one count of mail fraud and on the one count 
of obstruction of justice. Black was released from prison on May 4, 
2012.
