Oxford created Varsity Match history at Twickenham as they crushed Cambridge 43-6.

The Dark Blues' landslide success was Oxford's biggest winning margin since the fixture began in 1872.

It was also Oxford's fifth successive Varsity Match victory - the first time for them to achieve such a feat.

First-half tries by scrum-half Sam Egerton and centre Alexander Macdonald put Oxford in charge as they built a 17-6 interval advantage, before scoring 26 unanswered points after the break.

Egerton, who was sent off in last year's game following an incident in a ruck, set the tone by claiming a brilliant solo try after just 10 minutes, and Macdonald crashed over on the stroke of half-time.

Fly-half George Cullen converted both tries and kicked a penalty, while Cambridge replied with two Don Stevens penalties, although Stevens was then carried off injured early in the second period.

And it did not get any better for Cambridge as they saw a second player carried off - wing George Smith - after Oxford had made the game safe through further tries during a four-minute spell in the third quarter from lock Tom Reeson-Price and prop Ian Williams.

Oxford were in no mood to let up, though, and with Cambridge out on their feet, Cullen and flanker Gus Jones claimed touchdowns to complete the rout.

Cullen finished with a personal points tally of 18, and Cambridge did not even enjoy the satisfaction of a consolation try as Oxford retained a vice-like grip on proceedings before once again getting their hands on the trophy.
