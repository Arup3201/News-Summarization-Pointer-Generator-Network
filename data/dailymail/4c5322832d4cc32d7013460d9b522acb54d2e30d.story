Inter Milan are hopeful of concluding a loan deal for Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah.

Sunderland and Atletico Madrid have also made contact over a temporary deal for the Egypt international, who has made only six appearances this season and 17 overall since his £11million transfer from Basle last January.

Chelsea's Egyptian winger Mohamed Salah could join Italian giants Inter Milan on loan

Salah has only made 17 appearances for Chelsea since joining from Basle last January

The Italian giants have also spoken to Arsenal about a deal for Lukas Podolski. 

Roberto Mancini’s side are willing to offer £7m for the Germany forward — or take him on loan — but Arsenal would prefer to loan them 21-year-old French striker Yaya Sanogo. Talks will continue on Sunday with Inter director Piero Ausilio in London.

Podolski has expressed his frustration at spending most of the time on the bench and is demanding answers from Arsene Wenger over his future.

The German said: 'I am not 20 or 21 years old, I cannot afford to wait for a chance. I'm 29, and I want to play.

Inter Milan have also spoken to Arsenal about a possible £7m deal for Lukas Podolski 

'What more can I do than what I'm already doing? I scored two goals in the Champions League [against Galastasaray] and ended up on the bench right away.

'I do not know what else I have yet to prove. In the coming days I will speak with the club.

'I have to understand their intentions towards me. Arsene Wenger is not blind, he sees what I give.'

When asked about the Inter Milan interest, Podolski said: 'There is nothing certain. First I have to figure out what he wants to do with me at Arsenal.'

Meanwhile, former Arsenal midfielder Lassana Diarra is due to have a medical at Inter after turning down the chance to speak to QPR.
