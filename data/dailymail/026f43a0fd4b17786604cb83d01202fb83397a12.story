With sunbathers dressed in bikini tops enjoying the good weather and tourists punting down the river, it looked like a pleasant summer’s afternoon in Cambridge.

But as those making the most of the heat wave relaxed at the water’s edge on Jesus Green yesterday, two people lay dead on the opposite river bank.

As families and tourists sat in the park by the River Cam, the bodies of a man and woman were left on the sun-scorched grass covered by orange and white blankets.

Police sealed off the area with blue and white tape after the man and woman, said to be in her 40s,  were found collapsed shortly after midday.

Two pairs of discarded shoes and empty alcohol bottles lay strewn on the grass beside them.

The man and woman were declared dead at the scene and a second man was taken to the city’s Addenbrooke’s Hospital for treatment.

It is believed all three had been drinking by the riverside as part of a group since the previous evening and had taken drugs, though it is not known what substance was involved. 

Police said there were early indications the deaths were drug-related but officers refused to rule out the searing 29C heat as a contributory factor. 

The deaths are not thought to be the result of overdoses.

Detective Inspector Billy Bremner said: ‘We are aware that two people have died and a third was taken ill at about the same time. We are in the early stages of investigating these tragic deaths and are keeping an open mind as to the cause.

‘At this stage we can say that the three people involved are believed to have taken drugs in Cambridge shortly before becoming ill. We would urge anyone who has any information about the supply of drugs in the city to call police.’

One line of inquiry is that a contaminated batch of an illegal substance may be circulating in Cambridge, but the incident is not being linked to recent ecstasy-related deaths in Scotland. 

The deaths of seven young people in Scotland in the last two months are being linked to a batch of fake ecstasy tablets thought to contain toxic chemicals.

An 18-year-old woman from Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire, was the latest to die when she collapsed last Tuesday morning after taking a pill she believed was ecstasy.

Police have warned that the suspect pills are green in colour and stamped with a Rolex crown logo, and that some have been found to contain the dangerous stimulant paramethoxyamphetamine, also known as PMA.

The substance causes extremely high body temperatures, hallucinations and convulsions. Officers have also warned of a white pill with the Mitsubishi logo imprinted on it, found to contain the chemicals 5IT or AMT, and a yellow tablet with a star logo.

Jesus Green, on the edge of the River Cam, is popular in summer with both residents and visitors.

The river will this week play host to the Cambridgeshire Rowing Association Bumping Races. The event sees a number of crews racing at the same time on the narrow stretch of water. 

Rather than beginning side by side, the boats are lined up end to end, with one-and-a-half boat lengths (about 90ft) of clear water between them.
