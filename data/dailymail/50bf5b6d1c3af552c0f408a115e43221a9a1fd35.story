Under pressure: Trade minister and former HSBC boss Stephen Green faced serious questions last night over an email and Ed Miliband says he should face Parliament

Trade minister Lord Green faced demands to explain to Parliament what he knew about money laundering at HSBC when he was chairman of Britain’s biggest bank.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said the former bank boss must appear in the House of Lords to answer questions after documents came to light suggesting he was warned about money laundering when he ran HSBC.

An email published as part of a US Senate probe confirmed that Lord Green was made aware of serious allegations of wrongdoing in January 2005 by HSBC’s former compliance chief, David Bagley.

Mr Bagley, who quit on Tuesday, told Lord Green that staff in the bank’s Mexican subsidiary forged paperwork designed to help prevent money laundering.

Mr Miliband said: ‘What happened at HSBC is shocking. Lord Green must come to the House of Lords and answer questions, frankly, about what he knew and when he knew it.’

On Wednesday, Labour failed in an attempt to force Lord Green to come to Parliament to answer questions.

An urgent question tabled by Labour’s leader in the Lords, Baroness Royall, asking for a statement in the House of Lords about the Trade minister’s activities at HSBC, was rejected by Lords Speaker Baroness D’Souza.

But Labour sources said that they would  try again.

The Labour leader added claims of wrongdoing at the London-based banking giant, where the peer was chief executive and chairman before being brought into Downing Street by David Cameron in 2010, had 'appalled' people.

Lord Green is facing pressure to quit 
because he was chairman of Britain’s biggest bank when it was doing 
business with drug gangs and banks linked to terrorism.

Mr Miliband pointed out today that, although the Commons is now in recess, the House of Lords was still sitting so could grill him.

Labour's leader in the second chamber was writing to her opposite number Lord Strathclyde insisting that Lord Green should come to face peers, he added.

Mr Bagley has raised allegations that 
‘senior persons within the compliance function fabricated records of 
certain mandatory anti-money laundering meetings’.

The
forgeries were designed to hoodwink local regulators into believing the
division’s safeguards were stronger and more efficient than they were.

Mr
Bagley also warned that HSBC’s American division had accepted 
$2.9million (£1.8million) from clients in the military dictatorship of 
Burma, in contravention of US sanctions.

He said there was ‘little doubt’ that this breached sanctions and warned of a ‘significant risk of a financial penalty’.

The email is censored, preventing disclosure of who the transaction was for.

Lord
Green asked Mr Bagley on several occasions to investigate what measures
the bank’s subsidiaries were taking to prevent wrongdoing.

But weakness in the bank’s oversight, particularly in its US and Mexican subsidiaries, persisted for years afterwards.

US regulators were so alarmed by HSBC’s inability to prevent money laundering that in October 2010 they ordered it to improve ‘multiple aspects’ of controls to prevent money laundering.

HSBC has been linked to  terrorist organisations al-Qaeda, Hamas and the Taliban and is also accused of violating US sanctions on Burma, Cuba and Syria.

Labour said Lord Green, who left HSBC in 2006 and is now one of Chancellor George Osborne’s closest advisers on banking, had ‘serious questions’ to answer.

Chris Leslie, the shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, called on Lord Green to explain what he knew about the scandal, set to cost HSBC up to £640million in fines.

He said: ‘Stephen Green . . . has serious questions to answer about what he knew and when.’

The wording of the statement is a pointed echo of Mr Osborne’s controversial comment that Labour’s Ed Balls had ‘serious questions to answer’ over the Libor rate-rigging scandal.

A senior Downing Street source said David Cameron was standing by Lord Green.

The source added: ‘There is no appetite for him to cease being a trade minister.’
