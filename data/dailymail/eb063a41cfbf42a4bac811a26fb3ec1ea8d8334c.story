A trial against a Detroit police officer accused of shooting dead a seven-year-old girl ended in a mistrial after the jury became 'hopelessly deadlocked.'  

The jurors   were unable to reach a verdict in the case  against Officer Joseph Weekley who was accused of shooting Aiyana Stanley-Jones during a raid on a house for a murder suspect in Detroit.

Judge Cynthia Gray Hathaway  declared a mistrial in the case for the second time after the first trial ended in a hung jury in June 2013.

Death: Happy-go-lucky seven-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones was shot and killed on Sunday, May 16, 2010, by a  Detroit police officer during a raid to arrest a murder suspect

Shooting: Detroit Police Officer Joseph Weekley testifies during his first trial in Wayne County Circuit Court in Detroit, Michigan, his second trial was declared a mistrial on Friday

Judge Hathaway told the jurors: 'These things happen.’

But the little girl's distraught uncle Londell Fields said: 'I don't understand how we can go through this again and have all this evidence brought forth and there not be a verdict either way.'

'I don't think it's fair because he's a police officer that he gets to get away with this again. That's wrong to me.'

At the beginning of the case, jurors were asked to decide the officer's fate.

Yet the group of 12 was almost split down the middle over whether to acquit or convict Weekley on a misdemeanor charge of careless, reckless or negligent use of a firearm causing death.

‘This was an emotional case,’ the jury foreman told the media afterward. 

‘There were tears in this room.’

But race, the jurors said, never played a role in deliberations, despite the fact that Weekley is white, and Aiyana was black.

On the night of the shooting on May 16, 2010, police and the Special Response Team went to an address in Detroit's east side to carry out a search for a murder suspect.

They were accompanied by a camera crew from a TV reality show called 'The First 48, but the midnight raid was recorded from the outside, not the inside where Aiyana was shot. 

A stun grenade was thrown through a window to confuse anyone inside.

Then, officers stormed the house and once inside, a round from Weekley's sub-machine gun struck Aiyana in the head while she slept on a couch.  

The trial featured a multicultural jury made up of eight women and four men, four of whom were African Americans.  

The jurors, asked that their names not be made public as they explained what happened over four days of deliberations.

They said that they never agreed unanimously, but  listened to each others view points, took three votes and had some jurors shift sides. 

The jury foreman, a pastor said: ‘This has not been an easy case.’

During the last vote, the panel was split 7 to 5, with seven voting not guilty and five saying Weekley was guilty of the charge.

One of the most important questions that jurors needed to answer was whether the discharge of the weapon was a result of the defendant's carelessness, recklessness or negligence.

Some jurors felt Weekley, should not have allowed his gun to discharge because of his training as a member of the Special Response Team, while others could not determine what happened

‘It really came down to defining negligence,’ the foreman said.

During the trial, Steve Fishman, Weekley's attorney, told jurors that the officer mistakenly pulled the trigger during a struggle with Mertilla Jones, the girl's grandmother.

But Jones denied this.

Prosecutor Rob Moran argued: 'His training says, keep your finger off the trigger. ... All he had to do is follow his training and we wouldn't be here.' 

After the mistrial, Dominika Stanley, Aiyana's mother stayed in the courtroom, wiping away tears as she shook her head and held onto a tissue.

Meanwhile, Weekley released a statement shortly before the mistrial was declared.

It said: ‘No matter the outcome of any jury's decision, I have already been devastated and my life has been ruined irreparably by the events that occurred on May 16, 2010. 

'There has not been one single day that has gone by since that day where I have not thought about the loss of Aiyana and I will be haunted by this tragedy for the rest of my life.'

‘I have nothing but sympathy for the family of Aiyana ... I know in my heart and before God that what transpired that day was out of my control, but I will still have terrible grief weigh upon me every day for the rest of my life,’ his statement said.

But Aiyana's great-uncle Fields added that he thought Weekley should apologize and say he made a mistake.

‘The justice system did not work in this case,’ he said. 

‘I don't understand how we could go through this again and have all this evidence brought forth and there not be a verdict, either way.’ 

Weekely could still face a third re-trial.
