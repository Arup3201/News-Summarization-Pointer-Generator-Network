A teacher who told parents and colleagues he was changing sex and coming back to school as a woman has been found dead at home.

Lucy Meadows, 32, a Year Six teacher at St Mary Magdalen's Church of England Primary School, in Accrington, Lancashire, had changed her name from Nathan Upton after deciding to undergo gender reassignment surgery.

Last December, a newsletter was sent out by the school saying Mr Upton should be addressed as Miss Meadows when classes returned following the Christmas holidays.

Each class at the 169-pupil school - whose motto is 'Reaching our potential together in Christ' - was spoken to about the the schoolmaster's sex change.

This week, police went to the teacher's home in Accrington and found her body inside. The cause of death is not known but officers confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances.

The matter has been referred to the coroner.

News of the tragedy was broken today by the school's headteacher Karen Hardman, who posted a message on the school's website saying: 'It is with great sadness that I have to inform you of the death of Miss Lucy Meadows.

'Our staff will be working closely with bereavement teams and are here to offer the children and yourselves any support in any way we can.'

Lancashire Police said: 'At 4.45pm on Tuesday, March 19, police were called by the ambulance service to a report of a sudden death at an address in Accrington.

'On arrival, they found the body of a 32-year-old woman. There are no suspicious circumstances and a file will be prepared and passed to the coroner.'

The newsletter which was hand-delivered to parents, said: 'Mr Upton has made a significant change in his life and will be transitioning to live as a woman after the Christmas break. She will return to work as Miss Meadows.'

It said the school was fully supporting him throughout his 'transition' and added: 'We are proud of our commitment to equality and diversity among our staff and children.'
