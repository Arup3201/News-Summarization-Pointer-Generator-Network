An historic pub in Scotland that offers one of the best views for tourists trying to spot the Loch Ness Monster has been put up for sale. 

The Dores Inn is located at the north end of the famous Loch, eight miles from Inverness, and overlooks one of the most iconic landscapes in the Highlands.

The inn's current owners, Quintin and Michelle Stevens, have run the pub since 2008.

But now the couple, who also own the Storehouse of Foulis - a farm shop and restaurant - in Easter Ross, are calling time on their association with Dores and have put the inn on the market for £750,000.

In 2011, the Stevens revealed plans to close the inn and build a new tourist attraction in its place.

It was intended to be in a similar vein as their Easter Ross venture but the plans never came to fruition.

Listed in Lonely Planet earlier this year as one of 50 'undiscovered and overlooked' destinations in Europe, the pub has also proved popular with VIPs at the RockNess festival in previous years.

The pub's net turnover for the year ending March 31, 2014, was £847,322.

Selling agent Euan MacCrimmon, of Strutt & Parker, said: 'The sale of the Dores Inn provides a fantastic opportunity to purchase a successful bar and restaurant located on the shores of the iconic Loch Ness.

'The business has been trading extremely well over the past five years and there remains real potential to expand the business and take advantage of its highly scenic position with loch frontage and its close proximity to the popular city of Inverness.'

The full Lonely Planet entry reads: 'While tour coaches pour down the west side of Loch Ness, the eastern shore is relatively peaceful.

'Here you will find Dores Inn, a beautifully-restored country pub with a garden that even has its own Loch Ness Monsterspotting point.'

A full-time Loch Ness Monster hunter who has spent nearly quarter of a century looking for the elusive beast set up home in the pub's car park.

Steve Feltham, 51, left his job fitting security cameras and his home in Dorset to move to the banks of Loch Ness and devote his time to searching for the legendary monster in 1991.

He bought an old mobile library for £1,500, parked it in the Dores Inn's car park, and has lived there ever since.

A bachelor, he spends his days studying the waters of the loch and making models of the monster which he sells to tourists to fund his simple lifestyle.

He said: 'This is my passion and exactly what I want to do with my life.'

Mr Feltham said that he had seen the Loch Ness Monster once in 23 years - but didn't have his camera on him at the time.
