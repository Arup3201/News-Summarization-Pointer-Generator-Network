Dads struggling to find clean and safe places to change their youngsters' nappies are advocating to have baby change tables put into male public toilets.

Sparked by a number of fathers' groups in Melbourne, Victoria, the aim of the campaign is to have more accessible areas for male parents to change nappies. Most baby change tables are found in the female bathrooms.

The debate comes just weeks after Ashton Kutcher posted on Facebook about his struggle to find anywhere with men's baby changing facilities in the US.

Australians dads, such as Jason Cranage, 39, pictured here with daughter Bella, 2, are campaigning to have baby change tables put into male restrooms

George Kanjere, 31, is the primary carer for his nine-month-old daughter Ottalie and said he struggles to find public facilities where he can change her

'I don’t see any negative to it; it’s just about creating an opportunity in an ever changing society,' Jason Cranage, founder of Dads of Newport and Surrounds (DONS) told Daily Mail Australia.

'People within our dads group have voiced their opinion that there’d be no down side to it,' he continued.

Mr Cranage, father to Andy, 8, Paul, 6, and Bella, 2, said as his kids have grown up he has struggled to find places to change them, and had to settle for some less than ideal locations.

'Anywhere from the backs of cars to under trees, anywhere you can create a soft environment,' the 39-year-old said.

'Re-configuring the inside of your car, or even laying down the front seat.

'I've had to take my jumper off and use it as a pillow,' Mr Cranage revealed.

Earlier this month American actor Ashton Kutcher took to social media to vent his frustrations about the lack of male-friendly facilities

'I've had to take my jumper off and use it as a pillow,' Mr Cranage revealed, speaking of difficulties he's faced trying to find a place to change his kids' nappies

He said he and other dads within the group, based in Melbourne's south-west, have struggled with the issue for some time, which is even more prevalent for fathers who are primary carers.

'I don’t think men would feel that comfortable going into a female toilet to change a baby’s nappy,' Mr Cranage said.

The father-of-three said they would like to see businesses get on board and install something as simple as a plastic change tray like the ones installed in most female restrooms.

George Kanjere, a member of Northern Dads Group, also in Victoria, is the primary carer for his nine-month-old daughter Ottalie.

Mr Kanjere said it is difficult when his daughter Ottalie needs changing when they're our in public, and often changes her in the park or on a bench

He said there needs to be more accessible facilities for dads everywhere

He said the lack of facilities has been a problem since his daughter was born, but has become more prevalent in recent months after his partner went back to work.

'It’s been an issue the whole time, but more recently it’s become an issue when I became the primary carer,' Mr Kanjere told Daily Mail Australia.

The 31-year-old, from Prestons north of Melbourne, said he makes sure he is always fully equipped when he leaves the house, but was most surprised when he discovered his university didn't seem to have a family room.

He said that it was not only difficult for him, but unpleasant for those around him should he need to change Ottalie in public. 

Mr Kanjere also said other dads he knew were forced to change their children's nappies on the floor of the men's toilets because they had no other choice

Mr Kanjere also said other dads he knew were forced to change their children's nappies on the floor of the men's toilets because they had no other choice.

'I don't really think it’s that expensive to install one of those change tables that screw into the wall.

'(And) I don’t want to go into the women’s bathroom because that’s the women’s space,' the dad added.

Both men agreed that the shift needed to be made to keep up with changing roles of men and women in society, and the implementation of the change tables had no negatives.

'I think this could benefit everyone,' Mr Kanjere said, adding that while some places had family and parents' rooms, there were not nearly enough available.

'It’s all just about creating new opportunities,' Mr Cranage said.
