A mother has spoken of her anger after her daughter was excluded from classes because she dyed her hair ginger.

Shaunni Barker, 15, coloured her blonde hair dark red over the weekend and was shocked to be told by a teacher that her hair broke school rules.

She was removed from classes and told to do her work in an isolation room at Skegness Academy, Lincolnshire, until the washed the dye out.

Mother Sharon, 42, has demanded that her daughter, who she described as a ‘good and studious student’, be allowed back into class.

‘I’ve taken her home now because she will get no work done without her teacher to help her,’ she said.

‘Ginger is a natural colour really. It’s disgusting a student can be sent home or put isolation because of the colour of her hair.

‘How does the colour affect how you learn? She’s a good kid.’

She added: ‘I might be able to understand it better if she turned up to school with pink hair but ginger, or deep red, is a recognised colour.’

Shaunni was put into isolation when she turned up to the academy, which teaches 1,190 pupils aged 11-19, on Monday. She used £5 L’Oreal Performance colouring kit to dye her hair.

Her mother said she had dyed her hair ginger because she wanted to look 
like her grandmother - who is currently in poor health - when she was 
younger.

Her
 mother, who works at a discount shop, said: ‘My mum Janet Potts had 
lovely ginger hair when she was younger and Shaunni has always loved the
 colour.

‘She found the right hair dye and used it because she wanted
 to look like her gran because she's ill at the moment and Shaunni 
thought it would be a nice gesture.’

Her mother said Shaunni wanted to dye her hair ginger in order to look more like her grandmother, Janet

She explained that Shaunni, who 
aspires to be a photographer, had to work in a small office near the 
head of year and wasn’t allowed into the playground for breaktime. She 
was also told she had to eat lunch alone.

Her mother added: ‘It's 
like she's a prisoner in the school because she's decided to have ginger
 hair. It's appalling. No one deserves to be treated like this.’

Yesterday the school defended the policy on hair colour.

Executive Principal Emma Hadley said: ‘Our pupils are ambassadors for the academy and we expect them to represent us in the correct manner.

‘We want our pupils to present themselves smartly as we believe that the self-discipline this requires is an important lesson to learn as pupils will find that there is often a dress code in most places of work.

‘We provide very clear guidance to parents in our prospectus.’
