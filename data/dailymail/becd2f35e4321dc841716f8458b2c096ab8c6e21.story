A teenage girl will be charged with a drug-related offense after she handed out marijuana-laced lollipops to her classmates at Enfield High School in Connecticut this week, according to police.

Enfieild police said the girl from Connecticut confessed that she had given her classmates the pot-laden candy, making some students ill and leaving one in hospital.

Police Chief Carl Sferrazza said the student admitted that she had shared the lethal lollipops, laced with tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, an active ingredient in marijuana earlier this week.

The girl told detectives that she had received the candy from California. 

The incident only  came to light when a school resource officer became aware of a 16-year-old female student going to the hospital according to NBC Connecticut.

Chris Drezek, deputy superintendent of Enfield Public Schools, said that a student had gone to the nurse's office and the school nurse first thought that she had developed an allergic reaction.

However, the schoolgirl was later sent to hospital and stayed overnight on Monday.

Meanwhile, during the initial investigation, the suspect told police that said she distributed the marijuana lollipops to certain people in the school but not to the victim.

The police said that the case will remain under investigation.
