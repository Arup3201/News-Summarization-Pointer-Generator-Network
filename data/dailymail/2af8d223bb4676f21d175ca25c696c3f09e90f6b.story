A retired New York City police officer living in Bennett, Colorado, came home earlier this week to a scene of carnage, discovering five of her rare pet parrots brutally murdered and dismembered.

Cherie Morales, 55, said someone broke into her 12-by-16-foot backyard aviary and slaughtered most of its feathered inhabitants, among them Greater Vasa parrots.

‘When I saw that gate open, I immediately thought, “Oh no,”’ Morales told ABC7. ‘Then, I started seeing bodies and bodies without heads.’

Slain: Murphy the Greater Vasa parrot was among the five birds found brutally killed inside Cherie Morales' backyard aviary

Break-in: Morales said someone opened the gate of her enclosure while she was out and deliberately killed only her rare Greater Vasa parrots

Carnage: A neighbor described a horrific scene similar to a battlefield with the birds' tiny bodies strewn about the yard

Three of the birds were killed by decapitation, while the other two had their necks broken.

‘The three birds who were the sweetest of all of them had their heads ripped off from the neck,’ she said. ‘Their wings were pulled off. These birds had been brutalized past that.’

Neighbor David Lewis, who helped Morales pick up the birds’ tiny corpses, said one on the first things he saw in the yard was the head of one of the parrots on the ground and feathers everywhere.

‘It was really gruesome…like the aftermath of a war scene,’ he said.

Survivor: Of the seven Greater Vasas, only two birds survived by fleeing the aviary, and one of them later returned

Beloved pet: Morales is looking for the other surviving Greater Vasa parrot named Matisse who she believes is still in the area

‘It looked like a battle had happened
and then the bad people left and left all this aftermath of dead little
bodies,’ Lewis told ABC7.

Heartbroken: Morales, a former New York City cop, is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to an arrest

Two African gray parrots who were also
in the aviary were left unharmed, leading Morales to believe that 
whoever did this targeted the Greater Vasas because everyone knew they 
were her favorites, according to ABC News.

Of the seven rare birds that were in the enclosure, two managed to escape, but one of them later returned. Now, Morales is searching for the other surviving Greater Vasa parrot that goes by the name Matisse.

Morales said she has heard his bird call and believes he is still in the area.

‘These birds are so easy, so trusting,’ the 55-year-old said. ‘I have always prided my house on being a sanctuary for whatever person or critter need to come in.’

Morales posted a $1,000 reward on Craigslist for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the killings. 

The Adams County Sheriff's Department said it is investigating the case.
