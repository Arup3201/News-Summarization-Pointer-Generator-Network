A woman whose three-month-old daughter was allegedly poisoned and suffocated by a 10-year-old girl has blamed the child's mother, who was babysitting at the time, for the infant's death.

The elementary school student, from Fairfield, Maine, was charged with manslaughter yesterday after allegedly feeding Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway her attention-deficit disorder medication then smothering her, leaving her black and blue on July 8.

But Nicki Greenaway has hit out at the girl's mother -- a work colleague -- who she said was specifically told not to leave her baby daughter alone with the 10-year-old.

The Bangor Daily News of Maine reports that three-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway of Clinton died July 8, and the Maine State Police declared the death a homicide Wednesday

Nicole Greenaway, the infant’s mother, 
told The Bangor Daily News medication was found in
 her infant’s system which was the very same medication taken by the 
10-year-old girl

'I feel a little bit of relief that 
they're charging her (the babysitter's) daughter at this point, but the 
mom really needs to be responsible,' Greenaway said. 'She's the one I 
left my daughter with.'

The 10-year-old, who is not being 
identified, is the youngest person to be charged with manslaughter in 
Maine in at least 25 years. She is due in juvenile court in October.

Brooklyn was in the babysitter's care overnight in nearby Fairfield.

The sitter called police early on 
July 8 to report that the infant was not breathing, authorities said. 
Emergency workers who arrived minutes later reported the child was 
unresponsive.

Greenaway said that the 10-year-old 
had changed her baby's diaper in the past, but that she had told the 
sitter an adult needed to be present at all times.

The Bangor Daily News is not naming the mother in order to protect the identity of the juvenile charged with manslaughter. Police have also reportedly withheld the name of the girl

Instead, the infant, who was 
reportedly fussy that night, was sleeping in a portable crib in the same
 room as the girl, according to Greenaway.

Stephen McCausland, spokesman for the
 Maine Department of Public Safety, said he couldn't comment on whether 
charges could be brought against the babysitter.

McCausland said detectives uncovered 
some 'troubling signs' before the state medical examiner declared the 
baby's death a homicide on Wednesday. Investigators would not provide 
further details on the cause of death.

 'She suffocated her by putting her
 hands over her face. There are bruises
 all over her face.'

Greenaway told The Bangor Daily News a
 toxicology report stated a medication was found in the infant’s system 
that was the same medication taken by the 10-year-old girl.

She said that when she finally saw 
her daughter at a funeral home, the baby had a black eye, bruises on the
 bridge of her nose and marks that looked like fingerprints on her 
cheeks.

'She suffocated her by putting her hands over her face,' Greenaway told the newspaper. 'There are bruises all over her face.'

The mother of the 10-year-old has referred inquiries to her attorney, John Martin of Skowhegan.

Consultation: Authorities reportedly charged the 10-year-old with manslaughter in connection with the Attorney General's office

The 10-year-old charged is the youngest person to be hit with manslaughter charges in at least 25 years in Maine, according to officials

The girl will appear in Skowhegan District Court on October 22.

The babysitter hasn't been named in order to protect the identity of the juvenile charged with manslaughter.

The
 10-year-old girl is now in the custody of the Maine Department of 
Health and Human Services, McCausland said.

Greenaway works with the babysitter at MaineGeneral Medical Center in Waterville, according to the Bangor Daily News.

'I’m definitely glad they’re finally doing something,' she said.

'I just didn’t know when they were going to do it. (The last couple of days have been) pretty overwhelming.'

Greenaway, who reportedly has three 
other children, aged two, 15 and 16, said the last two months have been 
full of 'a lot of heartache and a lot of patience.'

'The decision on charging the girl 
was made after consulting with the attorney general’s office,' 
McCausland told The Bangor Daily News.

'The state medical examiner’s office continues to work on the case.'

'I have not done any research farther out than that,' he said.

The death of any child under age three automatically triggers an investigation in Maine.
