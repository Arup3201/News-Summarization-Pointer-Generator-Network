There aren't many bigger fans of Joe Hart than me. I think he's the best goalkeeper England has produced since David Seaman, and I love his passion for winning.

But that passion was no excuse for him to launch his head into referee Michael Oliver's face during the Manchester derby on Sunday.

The referee had dealt with the incident Hart was upset about, and the goalkeeper's rhino-like charge and butt at the referee was as bizarre as it was unnecessary.

Some might say the FA need to act on this, but I think there is a bigger concern. 

Oliver is a Premier League referee so he's considered to be one of the best we've got.

So why did he not send Hart off?

Think about it: a player charges at a referee and sticks his head in their face. That is a red card, and there is surely no room for debate on that.

So why did Oliver bottle that decision?

It's happening more and more. Big decisions are being dodged by referees who hope the FA will take responsibility the following Monday and charge the player they should have sent off.

This incident is disappointing for two reasons. Firstly, I actually rate Oliver as a referee.

Hart certainly appears to make contact with the referee, but Oliver appeared unperturbed

Secondly, he has done his colleagues who launch themselves into the firing line - into the heat of battle, into the ugly midst of 22 foul-mouthed, over-aggressive, testosterone-fuelled egomaniacs every week - a disservice.

Oliver's inexplicable refusal to show a straight red to Hart for such an act of aggression towards a match official sent the message to all players that if they fancy dominating and bullying a referee, they're likely to get away with it, because Hart did.

This was a great opportunity for Oliver to make a stand and demand respect for referees.

He got this one spectacularly wrong.

I do accept some officials make mistakes.

Just lately though, I'm left asking the question: 'What is the ref actually watching?' The Antolin Alcaraz handball at Goodison Park and the Michael Carrick/Marouane Fellaini foul on Sergio Aguero this weekend are poignant examples. 

But this incident was shocking. 

Hart was in the wrong, that's not up for debate. But so too was Oliver. An act of aggression towards a match official is always a red card. We can only hope the ridiculous leniency of this ref doesn't start a nasty trend.
