A 70-year-old real estate expert who solicited two girls - one 12, the other 13 - for prostitution through coded texts and secret phone calls has been arrested and charged with child sex trafficking.

Michael Lustig - who owns Real Estate License Services, a school based in Ocean Beach, San Diego, and who has authored over two dozen books - was pulled over in his car and arrested on Tuesday, having been wanted by the FBI in connection to a prostituion sting dating back to last summer.

Lustig was first arrested on June 8, 2012, at a hotel in the coastal town of Echinitas as one of several suspects targeted in a prostitution operation by the North County Human Trafficking Task Force (NCHTTF), at which time four of his cellphones were seized.

Michael Lustig, 70, was arrested in San Diego on Tuesday following a lengthy investigation into a prostitution ring. He has since been charged with two counts of sex trafficking of a minor, relating to alleged encounters with two girls, aged 12 and 13

During the ensuing investigation, Sheriff's investigators found Lustig had been texting and calling two girls, who were hidden in the phones under the male names 'Andrew' and 'Dominick'.

Lustig exchanged 39 texts and 110 phone calls with the 12-year-old during a four-month period last year, according to U-T San DIego.

There were also 60 texts between Lustig and the 13-year-old in late 2011, in which they used code words such as 'bookstore' and 'library' to set up dates.

Both girls were tracked down by police, with both admitting to allegedly performing sexual acts with Lustig for money in late 2011 and early 2012, reports NBC San Diego.

Both said they knew Lustig as 'George'.

The younger girl told investigators she’d been paid $80 for each of the 'five to seven' sexual encounters she’d had with Lustig.

The older girl said she was paid $200 on three separate occasions.

Investigators also obtained other evidence through search warrants and subpoenas, including motel surveilance footage of Lustig entering a room with one of the girls and leaving about 25 minutes later.

With this new information, officials once again began searching for Lustig, who was no longer in custody.

A warrant was issued for his arrest, charging him with two counts of sex trafficking of a minor.

Lustig owns Real Estate License Services, a school based here, in Ocean Beach, San Diego, that teaches people to become brokers or insurers. He has also authored over two dozen books

Lustig is now being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center without bail until further issue can be argued in San Diego Ferderal Court tomorrow.

“This is now a case of human trafficking, and must be addressed,” San Diego County Sheriff’s Department spokesperson Jan Caldwell told NBC.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Alessandra Serano, who specializes in human trafficking cases, said that none of her previous prosecutions has involved victims as young as these.

Authorities have not revealed further information about the sex trafficking case, including if there are other targets in the investigation.

Lustig plans to hire a private attorney.
