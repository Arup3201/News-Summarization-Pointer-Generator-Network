There is just one job requirement on Darren Bent’s CV and the striker duly delivered it, marking his first start for Derby with his first goal.

A bog-standard header, presented to him a yard or so out, provided the Championship club with the platform to ease into the fifth round of the FA Cup.

Homegrown Will Hughes, he of the straw-coloured hair and Duracell disposition capitalised on a rare Chesterfield mistake to double the lead near the end.

Job done for Aston Villa’s on-loan Bent and job done for Steve McClaren as he juggles the spirit-lifting prospect of a Cup run with the ultimate aim of promotion to the Barclays Premier League.

League One Chesterfield were given the respect they deserved with McClaren selecting a strong side, including Bent and Spanish defender Raul Albentosa.

Derby also trialled a new formation, going for the suddenly back-in-fashion three central defenders against Chesterfield’s four-four-two.

Yet it was the lower League side who started the brighter as striker Armand Gnanduillet twice found himself in what could be described as shooting positions.

Unfortunately for the forward both efforts were blocked and, as a consequence, Derby woke up.

The breakthrough came from Omar Mascarell’s corner, which was headed into the turf by Jake Buxton, bounced up and there was master predator Bent from close range.

A year ago Bent netted in the FA Cup for Fulham against Norwich. Two seasons ago he was wearing a Villa shirt as he scored against Ipswich and Millwall in the same competition.

Whether the wanderer has found his spiritual home at the iPro is too soon to say but he is guaranteed lots of chances from Derby’s open style of play.

A few were created against Chesterfield, who were playing their sixth Cup tie thanks to a replay with MK Dons after fielding an ineligible player and a bona fide replay for drawing with Scunthorpe.

Throw Braintree into the mix and Paul Cook’s team had earned the right for a day in the limelight.

Six thousand fans made the short trip for a Derbyshire derby and a rare FA Cup meeting between the two sides.

This was the third time they have met in this competition. Historical

note: In 1948 Derby won by this scoreline and in 1907 the first match was 1-1 with Derby winning the replay 4-0.

More usual these days is a fixture for the Derbyshire Centenary Cup.

Chesterfield wanted to make the most of their first fourth round tie since the famous run of 1997 when they went all the way to the semi-finals.

In the end, though, they could not make the most of their rare chances.

James O’Shea and Jimmy Ryan might look back with a tinge of regret after snatching at shots.

Chesterfield goalkeeper Tommy Lee, on the other hand, played commendably well making saves from Bent and Johnny Russell.

The game looked to be settled at one goal when Hughes robbed Sam Clucas and steered the ball past Lee.

Clucas had been the scoring hero in the previous round but that’s the problem with FA Cup dreams. They tend not to last that long.
