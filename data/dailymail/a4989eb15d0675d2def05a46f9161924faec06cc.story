An expat benefit cheat who swindled £60,000 from British taxpayers has been ordered to repay just £1 - because his house is in Spain is in his wife's name.

Jimmy Rickner was branded a 'financial parasite' by a judge after claiming to be a penniless pensioner in Britain when in fact he was married and living abroad.

He claimed pension credit and disability living allowance for eight years by lying about where he lived and his marital status.

Rickner had said he was living on his own in Exeter, Devon, when he was actually living in Cartagena and Almeria.

The false addresses were actually owned by his wife's daughter.

The 73-year-old was jailed for six months last year but returned to Exeter Crown Court for a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing.

There, he was told he must pay just £1 after his publicly-funded barrister told the judge he had no recoverable assets and the £80,000 villa where he lives in Spain is in his wife's name.

The court heard Rickner married Jennifer Wicks in 2005. Within months, the couple had sold her house in Exeter, making a £191,000 profit, which they used to start a new life in Spain. 

Recorder Mr Nicholas Hall told the court Rickner had benefited by £60,353.58 from crime - but there were no available assets to seize.

He added the Crown will be able to pursue Rickner for the money if he ever returns to Britain and has assets of his own.

He said: 'If Rickner were to return to this country to take advantage of our wonderful NHS, the prosecution could have another go in the future.

'This is not an attractive position for the court to adopt and frankly one has the feeling the Rickners have done rather well in the way they have managed things.

'The court is presented with a dilemma. In plain terms, Rickner has ended up with no assets and his wife with a property in Almeria.

'It leaves the court a most unsatisfactory position. Rickner has enjoyed the benefit of accommodation for a considerable period of time. 

'It is accepted by the Crown there is no prospect of a finding being made against him which can be enforced.

'I have taken some time to explain this order because sometimes these things are controversial and difficult for the public to accept. I have expressed my own concern that the court has been left in this position.'

The Recorder explained that Spanish property laws are different from those in Britain, meaning that as a husband Rickner has no stake in the house in Almeria because it is solely in his wife's name.

He said even if the couple were to split up and return to Britain he would have very little claim on the proceeds of the sale of the Exeter house in 2006 because it had been his wife's property and was sold shortly after they married.

James Taghdissian, prosecuting, said it is accepted the only tangible assets now remaining are the house in Almeria, which is in the sole name of Mrs Rickner.

He said the amount which Rickner obtained by benefit fraud was £48,000 but the figure had been increased to £60,000 through the addition of interest.

Lisa Hennessy, defending, said the couple had lost money on their first home in Spain and then moved to their current address, where the current valuation is also less than the 105,000 Euros (£82,000) Mrs Rickner paid in 2010.

She said Rickner has no realizable assets in his own name and said the only option open to the court was a nominal order to pay £1.

At his original hearing Judge Barry Cotter, QC, told Rickner: 'You were a financial parasite who lied repeatedly. 

'The public view dishonesty of this sort at a time of financial austerity as behaviour which demands and calls for significant punishment.'
