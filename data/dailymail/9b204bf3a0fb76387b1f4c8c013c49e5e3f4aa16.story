Inter Milan have announced the capture of Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic for next season.

Sportsmail revealed how Inter had been first to react to the veteran Manchester United defender’s decision to quit Old Trafford at the end of the season.

The club confirmed they had finally got their man on Wednesday and a picture of Vidic was posted on Inter's official Twitter feed along with a welcome message for the United star that read: 'Here's Vidic signing his contract. See you in June, Nemanja!'

President Erick Thohir immediately hailed the signing as 'crucial' for the team.

'Vidic is a great champion,' he said 
on inter.it. 'I am extremely satisfied with the completion of this 
agreement that will bring Nemanja to Milan.

'He
 is one of the strongest defenders in the world, for his 
characteristics, his international experience, his charisma as a leader 
will be crucial for the team and the growth of our younger players.

'He will add value to the club and will be another pillar for the construction of a great Inter.

'Finally,
 I want to thank Manchester United, Nemanja and his entourage for his 
availability and the professionalism shown during the negotiation 
process.'

An agreement has been reached on a 
lucrative three-season deal that will send Vidic into 
retirement on a high, in terms of status and earnings, at another of 
Europe's most famous clubs.

The
 32-year-old's contract that will be portrayed as being for two years, 
with an option for a third, but is effectively for three seasons. He 
needs to make a certain number of appearances for the third year to kick
 in, but it is believed to be so low – barely double figures each season
 – that it should be a formality.

With
 the Serbia centre back out of contract in the summer and a free agent, 
he has been able to secure a salary of £3m a year after stoppages, 
despite his best years being behind him. 

It is the equivalent of around £6m 
each season, before tax and other deductions, and means he will have 
earned close on £20m by the time he finishes his San Siro contract
and, in all probability, calls time on his career at the top.

The combative defender has proved an inspired signing since arriving at Old Trafford from Spartak Moscow for £7million in January, 2006, but is in danger of bowing out on a low after a dismal season for United on the domestic front and calamitous performance in Greece last week.

However, Inter are not faring too much better in Serie A where they are fifth, 11 points off the Champions League places.

And Inter might not be done there, with Patrice Evra also on the Italian side's wishlist.

Like Vidic Evra, 32, will also be out of contract at United in June and so far the floundering Premier League champions have showed no inclination to offer him a new one.
