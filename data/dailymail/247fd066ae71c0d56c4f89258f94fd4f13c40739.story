Green MP Caroline Lucas has been charged with public order offences following her arrest during anti-fracking protests in Surrey last month.

The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed this afternoon that Ms Lucas is to be prosecuted for 'breaching a police order and 'blocking the highway'.

The Brighton MP was among 30 people arrested on August 19 at the Cuadrillia drilling site in Balcombe as police cracked down on protestors.

She will appear at Crawley Magistrates Court on October 9.

Nigel Pilkington, a senior lawyer with the Crown Prosecution Service South East, said: 'Following an investigation by Sussex police, the Crown Prosecution Service has received a file of evidence in relation to Ms Caroline Lucas MP, who was arrested during the anti-fracking demonstrations at the Cuadrillia drilling site in Balcombe last month.

'After careful consideration, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and that it is in the public interest to prosecute Ms Lucas for breaching a police order on public assemblies and wilful obstruction of the highway.

'Sussex Police has therefore been authorised to charge one count of breach of a section 14 order contrary to section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986 and one count of Wilful Obstruction of the Highway contrary to section 137 of the Highways Act 1980.'

Protestor: The Green MP for Brighton Pavilion had warned about the dangers of fracking before her arrest last month

News of Ms Lucas's charges comes as she was due to join East Sussex firefighters as they go on strike in a row about pensions and pay.

Miss Lucas had joined scores of other protestors at the exploratory drilling site at Balcombe last month.

She had warned that that fracking could cause 'extreme damage' to the environment for years to come.

More than 100 arrests have been made since the demonstrations sprung up in July.

For more than seven weeks, Sussex Police has been overseeing the encampment of dozens of activists outside an exploratory oil drilling site in Balcombe.

Amid sometimes tense scenes, officers have been ensuring deliveries enter the site where energy firm Cuadrilla has been conducting test drilling.

Although no hydraulic fracturing has been taking place, the village has been thrust to the forefront of anti-fracking protests.

The cost of the policing operation in Balcombe has hit more than £2.4 million, leading Sussex’s police and crime commissioner Katy Bourne to ask the Home Office for financial help.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
