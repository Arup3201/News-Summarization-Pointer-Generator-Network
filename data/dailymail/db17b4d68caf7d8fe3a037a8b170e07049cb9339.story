World Cup winner Jonny Wilkinson insists rugby union is no more dangerous in the professional era than it has ever been.

The 35-year-old former England fly-half suffered more than his fair share of time in the treatment room during an illustrious career which drew to a close at the end of last season.

But at the end of a week which saw national coach Stuart Lancaster lose back row Tom Johnson having already faced up to the absence of fellow forwards Alex Corbisiero, Mako Vunipola, Dan Cole, Tom Youngs and Geoff Parling for the autumn internationals, Wilkinson is confident a greater reliance on sports science will protect players, provided they act responsibly themselves.

Speaking at an event in Newcastle a year to the day before the city hosts its first fixture of the Rugby World Cup 2015, he said: 'I don't necessarily believe there is a great deal more injury going on now since professionalism really kicked in during the late 1990s.

'It happens. Most of it is contact injuries which can't be avoided. The ones you avoid are the ones where you have got to say, 'We can't accept this'. You can't have guys missing seasons because they aren't being looked after properly, pulling muscles in training and those sort of things.

'There is that, but you can't change the fact that guys are going to get bigger. The problem is not so much they are getting bigger, it's that the bigger ones can run faster. That is the issue, because that is what creates the power.

'We need to make sure that guys are well looked after. You have got to listen to players and try to balance up this pressure to succeed all the time.

'That's difficult when you have got teams that are suffering relegation issues, teams that are fighting for titles and players coming back from injury.

'You want to say, 'Just play this game for us, you'll be all right and if you can just do this one, we will give you two weeks off'.

'It's a difficult one to fight because I have been in that situation several times and I would always choose to play. It's not clever. But you love rugby and you think, 'I might not get this chance again'.

'But now I am retired, I am just so glad that I can walk around happily, and I know that I can still go to the gym and I can get on a bike and I can run around a little bit.

'You never know what that next knock is going to mean, so the player has to be responsible as well, enough to say, 'Look, I am not actually feeling good, this doesn't feel right' because that's the only way that people get the right feedback, if you speak honestly.'

Wilkinson, who was sidelined by a succession of serious ankle, shoulder, knee and groin injuries during a 17-year-playing career capped by the drop-goal which clinched the 2003 World Cup, admits retirement has brought some relief from the pressures top-class rugby put on his body.

However, he is not sorry to see the back of the powerhouse runners - and those from Samoa and Tonga in particular - who at times left him clasping at fresh air in his latter days at Toulon.

He said: 'That was one of the reasons, other than the pressure, why I gave up in France. I was pretty glad to get out of the way of some of these guys.

'Some of the wingers over there are incredible. They run at you and you get prepared for the biggest collision of your life and then as you go for that, they then dance around you and run off somewhere else and you think, 'What am I supposed to do?'.

'That was the no-win situation I am kind of glad I don't have to face anymore.'
