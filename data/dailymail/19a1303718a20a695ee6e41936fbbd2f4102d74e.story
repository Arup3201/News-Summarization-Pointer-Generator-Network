Arsenal forward Lukas Podolski has provided the clearest indication yet that he is open to quitting the club in January.

The Germany international has hardly featured for the Gunners this season and has grown increasingly frustrated at his lack of action.

He looked set for a move away in the summer, but Olivier Giroud's ankle injury scuppered any possibility of him leaving.

But the forward had admitted he is finding his lack of minutes difficult to take and could leave the Emirates in January.

'Of course I am not happy with my situation right now,' admitted the German.

'I can’t be satisfied with that. We’ll see what happens in January.

The signings of Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck had pushed Podolski further down the pecking order 

'It is hard when you can’t do what you love. I don’t know why that is, you’d have to ask my coach (Arsene Wenger) in England

'If you can't play then you can't say he's not playing well or he has a crisis if you're not given the chance.

'If you only come in for 8 or 10 minutes it is hard to get into the game.'
