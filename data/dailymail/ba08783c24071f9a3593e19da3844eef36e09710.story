She is often referred to as the 'quiet seamstress' whose dignified refusal to move seats on a segregated bus triggered one of the key flashpoints of the civil rights movement. 

But Rosa Parks was a committed activist who wrote of how she was tired of being 'pushed around' as a black person and was so deeply opposed to segregation she risked her whole future to defy it.

This fresh understanding of Parks emerges from a remarkable new archive of her letters, writings, personal notes and photographs which is to be opened to the public for the first time.

A 1950s photograph of Rosa Parks and a paper written she wrote about segregation are some of the items in the Rosa Parks archive, soon to be open to the public at the Library of Congress

Beginning on Wednesday at the Library of Congress in Washington DC, visitors will be able to catch a glimpse of the real woman behind the symbol of defiance whose courageous stand on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955, triggered a yearlong boycott that helped dismantle the system of segregation.

Parks died in 2005 aged 92 and a protracted legal battle between her heirs and friends had kept the collection from public view for years. However, in 2014 philanthropist Howard Buffett bought the collection and placed it on long-term loan at the national library. 

Scholars have welcomed the move the make the material more accessible as, until now they had very limited, if any, access to the materials. 

'I think it's one of the first times we're actually able to read her voice and it just totally goes against this image of the quiet seamstress,' said Margaret McAleer, an archivist at the library. 

'Her writings are phenomenally powerful.' 

In one extract from the collection. Parks wrote: 'I had been pushed around all my life and felt at this moment that I couldn't take it anymore.' 

'When I asked the policeman why we had to be pushed around, he said he didn't know. '"The law is the law. You are under arrest." I didn't resist.'

Parks also wrote of feeling lonely and lost as she lived through the struggle with segregation.

After her arrest, Parks lost her job as a tailor at Montgomery's largest department store because of her activism.

Her husband, Raymond, also lost his job and the couple sank into deep poverty. They moved to Detroit but continued to struggle.

She traveled with the NAACP, pressing for civil rights, and eventually landed a job at the Hampton Institute in Virginia earning $3,700 a year — enough to send some money home to her husband and mother. 

It wasn't until 1965 when Parks was hired for the district office of Michigan Congressman John Conyers that she finally earned a steady, living wage, archivists said.

Parks' archive provides scholars and the public with a fuller sense of her life and faith, her personality and her pain, said library historian Adrienne Cannon.

'It's important because we see Rosa Parks in a kind of almost frozen, iconic image — a hero that is not really real flesh and blood,' Cannon said. 

The archives reveal Parks, pictured left in 1999, was supportive of controversial black leader Malcolm X

'Here we get a sense of a woman that is really full flesh and blood.' 

The collection may surprise people by revealing Parks had an aggressive edge and supported more radical actions seeking equality over the years, archivists said. 

She used her symbolic status to support Malcolm X, Black Panther gatherings and the Wilmington 10 in North Carolina.

'She was so deeply opposed to segregation that as the younger generation came along, she didn't hold back from them. She was in the fight,' said Helena Zinkham, the library's collections director.

The library now holds about 7,500 manuscript items and 2,500 photographs from Parks, including the Bible she kept in her pocket, letters from admirers and her Presidential Medal of Freedom. 

A small exhibit is planned for March. All the items will be digitized and posted online.

Artifacts such as Parks' clothing, furniture and a pillbox hat she may have worn on the Montgomery bus, will find homes elsewhere. 

The library plans to place them with other museums or institutions that can conserve and display Parks' belongings. 

The library is already in talks with the Smithsonian's National Museum of African-American History and Culture, now under construction on the National Mall, to house some items.
