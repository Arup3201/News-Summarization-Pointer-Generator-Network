Stuart Lancaster hailed Mike Brown’s bravery following the sickening head injury which left the England full back unconscious on the Twickenham turf needing seven minutes of treatment before being taken off on a stretcher.

Brown’s injury came in the 13th minute of England’s 47-17 win over Italy, the result of a collision with Italy’s Andrea Masi as he attempted to avert a certain try for the visitors. 

The 29-year-old reappeared on the touchline in the second half and will undergo strict return-to-play protocols before being considered to face Ireland in a fortnight.

After the game Lancaster praised his injured star. ‘It was a very dangerous moment of the game. It was a great chip over the top and typical Mike he was brave and it was a try-saver,’ Lancaster said. 

‘He is talking fine now and he seems ok. It helps that it is two weeks and a day (until Ireland) but we will take him through the return-to-play protocol.

‘I spoke to him and he was grumpy that he had to miss the game and frustrated - but he is grumpy anyway.’

The collision left the Twickenham crowd hushed and his team-mates shaken as they took 21 minutes to get on the scoreboard after Sergio Parisse had put the visitors in front.

England went on to score six tries. Jonathan Joseph crossed twice and Danny Cipriani scored on his first game at Twickenham in seven years.

Brown later reappeared on the touchline in the second half to watch England cruise to a 47-17 victory
