KRQE news anchor Jessica Garate says 'I love how my days are unpredictable - that's why I work in TV'.

However, she probably wasn't thinking of comedy falls during her broadcasts when she wrote that on her biog for the station's website.

In a recent show, while she was reporting on same-sex marriages, an unnamed person flew into shot and landed with a thud on the floor.

Ever the professional, Mrs Garate, who has been working for Albuquerque-based KRQE since 2004, maintained her composure throughout the incident and didn't even flinch when the uninvited guest arrived at an alarming velocity.

This could be, of course, because she didn't notice.

The person who made the unexpected appearance, a volunteer tasked with answering the phones at the station's call center, didn't appear to be hurt. She quickly got up and walked off.

Footage of the 'faceplant' has gone viral after being posted by Drew J. Lynch on YouTube, amassing over 13,000 views to date.

Another 'news fail', meanwhile, occurred courtesy of MSNBC, which caused a media stir after announcing Kim Kardashian's decision to accept Kayne West's marriage proposal using footage of a woman falling face first onto train tracks.

During the report this week about a woman who sleepwalked off a subway platform, MSNBC accidentally put up the caption, 'Kimye Engaged'.

Punters questioned whether the premature headline was really an accident, while media outlets described the gaffe as 'one of the more disturbing cable news images in recent history' and a 'chyron fail'.Â
