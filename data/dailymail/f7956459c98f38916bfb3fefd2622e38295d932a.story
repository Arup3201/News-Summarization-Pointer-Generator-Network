A little boy suffered horrific injuries after he was crushed by a stone wall while out playing with friends.

Harley Chivers, six, was left with a huge gash to his head, a broken arm and needed emergency facial surgery after the wall, near his home in Cwmtillery, South Wales, collapsed.

His mother, Claire Hockey, was horrified as the youngster turned up at home, covered in blood and nursing his arm on October 26 and immediately called an ambulance.

He was taken to Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, where the true extent of his injuries were revealed.

His arm had to be put in a cast, his two front teeth had been pushed back chipping his jaw bone, his lip and knee had to be stitched and the back of his head was glued and needed 15 stitches.

Doctors said it will take nine months for the Blaentillery Primary School pupil to make a full recovery and that he will be scarred for life.

Ms Hockey said her son and his friend told her that one of the children had pulled at a stone in the wall while they were playing that lead to its collapse.

She said Harley told her stones had hit him but had then rolled off meaning he could get back up and make it home.

He
had used his arm to protect his face when the wall fell saving himself 
from injuries that could have been even more devastating.

Wounded: Harvey covered in bandages, cuts and bruises while in hospital after the incidentÂ 

She said: 'He was crying and he kept saying, 'I'm dying'. I just screamed. There must have been a weakness in the wall for it to happen.

'I know these walls are all around the area but they shouldn't be by a children's play area.

'Harley is getting better now but he has been in so much pain and been so scared.

A Blaenau Gwent council spokeswoman said it was clear that the wall had been vandalised due to gaps in the standing wall where stones had been removed. This had caused a layer of stones to collapse.

She said: 'We are now working with Gwent Police in order to make further investigations. Several follow-up visits to the site have also been made'.
