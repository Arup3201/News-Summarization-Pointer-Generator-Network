Fired: Marie Margaret Sloan was found guilty of four years of misconduct and taken off the nursing register to protect the safety of elderly and vulnerable patients

A 'foul-mouthed' convent nurse has been struck off the nursing register.

Marie Margaret Sloan was sacked from her post as care manager of the Sisters of Loreto's North Wales branch following a four-year spell of chaos.

A Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) fitness to practise hearing heard how the Facebook-loving grandmother allowed a frail nun to be given the wrong medication for at least a week and trawled the internet for embarrassing stories about the Sisters - who she said were ‘bonkers’ and a ‘pain in the a***’ to staff.

An NMC panel, which believes Ms Sloan sneaked hundreds of prescription tablets belonging to a dead nun into South Africa for her ill brother, said the registrant placed her patients at unwarranted risk time and time again.

Chairwoman Christine Castledine said people would be placed in danger if the registrant was allowed to stay on the nursing register.

‘Her conduct took place over a significant period of time when she was dealing with vulnerable and elderly patients who depended upon her,’ she added.

‘Despite Ms Sloan being in a position of trust, the care of the Sisters was not her first concern.’

The Sisters of Loreto in Abbey Road, Llandudno, is a former school turned spiritual retreat and offers up to 20 residential places for elderly Sisters.

Registered nurse Ms Sloan began working there in 2008 after bosses decided to create the new post of care manager.

Despite impressing in interview with her ‘extensive’ nursing experience, her abilities were soon called into question.

Risks: The Nursing and Midwifery Council found Ms Sloan gave a nun at the Sisters of Loreto in Wales the wrong medication for a week. She also trawled Facebook for embarrassing stories to torment them

In 2011 and 2012, inspections of the 
convent were carried out by external auditors, who said they were 
shocked at what they found.

Carer
 and cook Janet Starr, who has worked there for 16 years, told the NMC 
the place was supposed to be holy and serene, but she added: ‘One of the
 carers came into work drunk and I had to send her home for everyone's 
safety.

‘I phoned Marie about it but her reply was, 'I can't do anything about it'.’

Inspectors
 also found patient confidentiality was breached by ‘loud-mouthed’ Ms 
Sloan, no staff training was provided and medication was not safely and 
securely stored. A housekeeper said she often found tablets strewn over 
the floor and in unlocked draws.

Ms
 Sloan was also accused of suddenly stopping the drug supply for a woman
 referred to in the hearing as Patient A, without approval from a 
doctor.

When the elderly 
woman died, the NMC was told how the registrant forgot to cancel the 
prescription, resulting in a stockpile building up.

'Marie said the medication was too 
expensive out there and her brother-in-law couldn’t afford it. I told 
her that was illegal and drug-smuggling, but she didn’t seem to care.'

Mrs Starr said her former boss confessed to taking ‘hundreds’ of the tablets to South Africa.

‘Marie
 said the medication was too expensive out there and her brother-in-law 
couldn't afford it,’ she added. ‘I told her that was illegal and 
drug-smuggling, but she didn't seem to care.’

Also
 in 2012, a woman referred to as Patient B was given incorrect 
medication. The NMC said the gaffe, which caused ‘actual patient harm’, 
was noticed when the unwell Sister noticed someone else's name on the 
packaging of the tablets just before she was due to see a GP.

The
 doctor's appointment was cancelled but the mix-up was never recorded in
 the patient's notes and only came to light when the pensioner told 
another member of staff in passing about it.

A three-person panel said Ms Sloan's behaviour fell well below the standards expected of a registered nurse.

They
 referred to an incident where Ms Sloan contacted ex-pupils of the nuns 
over the internet in an attempt to find embarrassing stories about them.

As
 well as sharing the information she claimed to have found with staff, 
she compared one of her Sisters to an internet photograph of a topless 
grandmother who had had breast enhancement surgery.

It
 was also alleged Ms Sloan made inappropriate comments, saying the nuns 
were ‘all bonkers’ and ‘I ain't f****** taking that woman again because 
it's a pain in the a***’.

Mrs
 Starr added: ‘It was just terrible. She was supposed to be protecting 
these ladies, but she didn't treat them with any respect at all.’

Action: The Facebook-loving care manager has since been fired after four years of misconduct

Despite
 being given plenty of opportunity to rebuff the claims, the registrant 
opted to stay away from a five-day hearing in Cardiff.

After
 deciding 13 allegations of misconduct proven and her fitness to 
practise was impaired, the NMC said that as well as protecting patients 
it had to ensure public confidence in the profession was maintained.

Case
 presenter Robert Clarke said: ‘Ms Sloan put the sisters at unwarranted 
risk time and time again. They were vulnerable and elderly - one of the 
ladies is even over the age of 100.

‘And these were not isolated incidents either. It was a disturbing and protracted period of misconduct.’

Mrs Castledine said: ‘This decision sends a clear message of the standards expected and required of nurses.

‘Ms Sloan may face some hardship as the result of the decision, but the public's interest and protection outweigh these.’

Ms Sloan has 28 days to appeal against the decision.
