And then there were eight. 

The line-up for the Champions League quarter-finals was completed on Wednesday night as Barcelona and Juventus sealed their passage and though it may be a total wipeout for the English clubs, we certainly have a high pedigree field.

Now, more than ever, it's all about scoring goals at crucial moments as the Berlin final on June 6 looms on the horizon.

But which of the eight survivors is best-equipped for the challenge? We assess the forward trios of each team.

Atletico Madrid vs Real Madrid

Porto vs Bayern Munich

Juventus vs Monaco 

BARCELONA

Lionel Messi - Absolutely mesmerising against Manchester City and we are swiftly moving into territory where Messi may be considered the best player of all time. The Argentine maestro has 43 goals and 23 assists in 40 outings so far this season and, as ever, is central to Barcelona's hopes of another European Cup triumph Rating: 9.5/10

Neymar - A real joy to watch, the 23-year-old Brazilian just gets better and better with every passing week. May not be able to match Messi's prolific goalscoring but is just as influential when it comes to carving out chances with a moment of magic 9

Luis Suarez - His troubles of last summer behind him, £75m man Suarez is slowly growing into the kind of player Barcelona want him to be. Looks comfortable working in tandem with Messi and Neymar, running City ragged in the first leg of the last round tie 7.5

TOTAL: 26/30

REAL MADRID

Cristiano Ronaldo - It's become a season of frustrations for Real Madrid, but Ronaldo rises serenely above the negativity. With 41 goals and 21 assists in 39 appearances, his return this season has been as good as ever. Their guiding light when Real ended their long wait of the 10th European Cup triumph last season, he is needed again now 9

Gareth Bale - It's been a turbulent season for the Welshman, who seems to have been made the Bernabeu scapegoat for their shaky form post-Christmas, leading to suggestions he may return to the Premier League in the summer. But he has still scored 16 goals in all competitions this season 7

Karim Benzema - Often overshadowed by the aforementioned Bale and Ronaldo, the French striker just gets on with the business of scoring goals. He has plundered 20 in the season so far and is always capable of getting into dangerous positions 7.5

TOTAL: 23.5/30 

Cristiano Ronaldo is, as ever, integral to Real Madrid's hopes of winning the trophy

Gareth Bale has endured a difficult season but is sure to have an influence in the latter stages

JUVENTUS

Carlos Tevez - The renaissance of Tevez continued this week as his two goals in the Westfalenstadion carried Juventus through at the expense of Borussia Dortmund and increased his season's tally to 23, including six in eight in Europe. His deadly finishing combined with a strong work ethic is one of the reasons Juventus can be considered dark horses 8

Alvaro Morata - A 22-year-old with plenty of maturity and promise, moving from Real Madrid to Juventus for £17m last summer has proved the making of Morata. Also scored in Dortmund on Wednesday night and has 11 for the season 7

Roberto Pereyra - Proving an increasingly integral part of Massimiliano Allegri's system, Argentine Pereyra has licence to roam and run at defences. The 24-year-old has proved he can cut it at the top level this season 7

TOTAL: 22/30

MONACO

Dimitar Berbatov - The most chilled footballer around, Berbatov can still deliver the goods, as shown by his goal in Monaco's shock 3-1 win over Arsenal in the first leg of the last round. His goal tally may not be what it once was, but the Bulgarian is still more than capable of producing a moment of magic 7

Anthony Martial - While Berbatov is winding down, Martial is stepping up to the big time and hoping to live up to expectations. His goal return of five in 23 games this season isn't really good enough to suggest he'll take the Champions League by storm 6

Yannick Ferreira Carrasco - Monaco's other great young hope, Belgian winger Ferreira Carrasco came off the bench to score the decisive third at the Emirates. Can trouble defences with his pace and positivity. 7

PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN

Zlatan Ibrahimovic - PSG's one-man show just can't keep himself out of the headlines, for better or worse. We all know, on his day, the Swede can be unplayable but PSG will have to do without him in the last eight following his sending off against Chelsea. Get through that and he could help them spring a surprise 8

Edinson Cavani - Long-linked with a move away from the French champions, if Cavani is to depart this summer he'll want to go out with a flourish. An ever-present in the Champions League this season, the Uruguayan has a great return of 18 goals this season, a third of those coming in Europe 7.5

Ezequiel Lavezzi - It's been a hit-and-miss season for the Argentine, who has also been linked with a move away from the Parc des Princes. Nonetheless, he played a role in helping to guide PSG past Chelsea in the last round and could yet conjure a winning moment 6.5

TOTAL: 22/30

BAYERN MUNICH

Robert Lewandowski - With so many magnificent creative talents in the team, it's little wonder Bayern Munich are dominating domestically and the favourites to win the European Cup. But those chances need to be converted and Lewandowski has been the man this season, with 17 goals in all competitions. There's also that Thomas Muller fella too... 8.5

Arjen Robben - He may be into his fourth decade but Robben is arguably in the form of his life. He has a remarkable 17 goals in 20 in the Bundesliga, plus a couple more in Europe this season and has been terrorising defences and taking great pleasure from it 8.5

Franck Ribery - On the other side, Bayern's alternative attacking force - Ribery. With three goals in the Champions League campaign, he will inevitably have an impact if Bayern are to go all the way again 8

PORTO

Jackson Martinez - If Porto are to replicate their feats of 2004 and win the Champions League, the goals of Colombian Martinez will be key. He's already carrying them along, with five in the group phase. Despite his absence with a calf injury, Porto prospered against Basle in last round but will want him back with tougher tests lying in wait 7.5

Cristian Tello - It's been a productive loan spell for Tello, with seven goals and 11 assists contributed by the Barcelona forward. With a long-term stay at the Nou Camp pretty unlikely, Tello should use these high-profile Champions League games as a shop window 7

Hector Herrera - The Mexican midfielder's form is increasingly sharp, reaching a peak in the second leg with Basle where he scored and created another for Vincent Aboubakar. With nine assists overall this season, he can supply the ammunition for Martinez and Tello ahead of him 7

TOTAL: 21.5/30

Cristian Tello leaps over the Basle goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik during the second leg 

ATLETICO MADRID

Mario Mandzukic - Replacing Diego Costa is no mean task, but Mandzukic has made a decent fist of it with 20 goals this season, including five in the Champions League. If Atletico are to replicate last season's amazing run to the final, they'll need a few more from him 7.5

Antoine Griezmann - The Frenchman has been Atletico's driving force and a very classy one at that. He has 17 goals and six assists so far this campaign and plays with flair and confidence 8

Fernando Torres - A striker who is slowly but surely putting the torrid times endured at Chelsea and Milan behind him back on familiar turf. Yet to fully establish himself as a first-choice pick but may yet deliver that crucial goal 7
