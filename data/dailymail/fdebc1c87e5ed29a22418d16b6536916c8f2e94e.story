Robyn Turner has suffered three years of nightmares since the savage murder of her brother, whose body was found stuffed in a cupboard in a Sydney unit block.

Rodney Scarman, 52, was savagely beaten to death and found inside an electrical cupboard in Waterloo at about 4.30am on Boxing Day, 2011.

The murder resulted from a drug transaction gone wrong, police say.

Now, the family have again appealed for information about his death.

'It's torturing to my mind, emotionally it's agonising,' an emotional Ms Turner told reporters on Friday.

'I hope one day we have some closure to move on.'

An autopsy showed he had suffered significant injuries to most of his body.

Mr Scarman had been dumped in a communal area of the Walker Street unit block.

He was last seen a few hours earlier in an agitated state on nearby streets.

"Christmas isn't the same for us anymore," Ms Turner said in Sydney as her children Kaly and Beau stood by for support.

She held Mr Scarman's funeral card while remembering her gentle, quiet and artistic brother.

"It's difficult to sleep, nightmares, wondering who's out there and if they might do this somebody else," she said.

"I am pleading with people to look into their conscience and have the courage to come forward."

Superintendent Luke Freudentstein said fear or misguided loyalty was holding people back from giving information.

Police were confident people in the Redfern community had knowledge of what happened that night.

'I'm pleading for the sake of the family... and for justice,' he said.

'In an undignified manner he was stuffed in a cupboard.

'Imagine if it was your family.'

It's believed the attack was not targeted, he said, but related to a drug transaction gone wrong.

Police will accompany the Turner family while they letterbox drop flyers with their plea on Friday.
