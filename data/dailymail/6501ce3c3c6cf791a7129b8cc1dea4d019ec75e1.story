The partners of gay knights and dames could be given the right to use an honorary title under reforms to be considered by Parliament.

Under the current honours system, wives of men made Sirs or Lords becomes ladies.

But there is no equivalent for boyfriends of gay men given titles, like Sir Elton John's partner David Furnish. Neither can husbands of women made dames use a prefix.

The actor Sir Ian McKellen, who is openly gay, will also be affected by the proposed reforms.

Tory MP Oliver Colville will this 
week unveil a Bill under the 10 minute rule aimed at bringing equality 
to the system, amid reports the Government is preparing to investigate 
reform.

His Honours (Equality of Titles for Partners) Bill will be launched in the Commons on Tuesday.

Parliament is likely to consider the changes to the honours system more fully when they debate gay marriage.

The Liberal Democrats strongly support plans to allow gay couples to be married in civil ceremonies.

However, people within the Church of England and some Tory MPs are likely to vote against reform.

Mr Colville will ask 'that leave be given to 
bring in a Bill to make provision for husbands and civil partners of 
those receiving honours to be allowed to use equivalent honorary titles 
to those available to women'.

He told The Sunday Times: 'The current system is uneven and rather outdated.

'If you are made a peer or a knight, 
your wife automatically gets the title lady, but if you are gay or are a
woman and become a dame your partner gets nothing.'

Other high-profile people who could be affected include Mark Bolland, Prince Charles former deputy private secretary, who is in a civil partnership with Tory peer Lord Black of Brentford.

Lord Smith of Finsbury, who was one of the first openly gay MPs, will also be affected by the reforms. The former Labour minister is in a civil partnership with Dorian Jabri.

Former Labour minister Angela Eagle, who is in a civil partnership, said that it is time the law was changed.

'I'm not a great fan of the honours system but, if you are going to have one, it ought to confer equal honours on everyone who is awarded one,' she told the paper.
