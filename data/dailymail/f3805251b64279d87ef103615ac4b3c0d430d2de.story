As the tallest skyscraper in  Western Europe, the Shard offers breath-taking views of London.

But for a true intake of breath, wait till you see what it costs to enjoy them.

The £2billion building’s viewing platforms were opened to the public yesterday, but with tickets costing £24.95 for an adult and £18.95 for a child, it’s not just a fear of heights that might make visitors think twice.

Cityscape:The first visitors to the top of The Shard enjoy the view over a wet and rainy London

A breathtaking view? Heavy clouds cover the London skyline as the first visitors attend the official opening of The View at the Shard building in London this morning

When it rains: Heavy rain accompanied the thick cloud cover for the official opening today

Beneath the clouds: The top floors of the Shard - where the viewing platforms are situated - were barely visible this morning because of thick cloud

The 1,016ft (309m) Shard’s platforms 
were officially opened by London Mayor Boris Johnson, whose turn of 
phrase delighted and confused everyone present.

‘It’s like something prodding up 
through the frail integuments of the planet like an intergalactic 
spear,’ he said as he cut the ribbon at the opening ceremony. (In case 
you were wondering, an integument is defined in the Oxford English 
Dictionary as ‘that with which anything is covered, enclosed, or 
clothed; a covering, investment, coating’.

Warming to his theme, Mr Johnson 
enthused: ‘It’s like the tip of a cocktail  stick emerging through the 
skin of a super-colossal pickled onion. It looks as though it’s growing.

‘It looks as though subterranean 
forces are pushing it up so it will reach your [the designers’] vision 
of 400m which, of course, air traffic controllers refused to allow you 
to do.’

Unrivalled views: Visitors can see other London landmarks such as The Gherkin skyscraper, pictured to the left, situated in The City

The viewing room: The first members of the public to gain entry to The View at the Shard building enjoy the view at the attraction which was officially opened today

Visitors to the attraction - on floors 68, 69 and 72 - are whisked up in two high-speed lifts in around 60 seconds.

On a clear day, visitors enjoy a 360-degree view of the capital’s skyline to up to 40 miles from a platform almost twice the height of any other in the city.

With the help of specially-designed telescopes, they should be able to pick out London’s landmarks in the streets below.

Those using the telescopes will, by focusing on a particular landmark, receive audible information about it.

But visibility was restricted for the dignitaries, journalists and members of the public attending the launch this morning because of wet and cloudy weather.

Mr Johnson described the building as 'a most amazing place'.

Bad luck: On a clear day, visitors can see 40 miles out over London, but thick cloud cover limited views at the opening today

The outdoor viewing platform on Level 
72 – 800ft (244m) up – and the 360-degree indoor viewing area on Level 
69 – 776ft (236.5m) up – create the ‘View from the Shard’.

Lifts travelling at six metres a 
second whizz you up to the platforms where you peer through the 
floor-to-ceiling windows made of reinforced – but only 12mm-thick – 
glass.

The platforms are the only places 
where it is possible to see all of London at once, with the 40-mile 
views taking in the Tower of London, St Paul’s, Big Ben, Buckingham 
Palace, Wembley Stadium and The Oval.

‘The View’ has sold out this weekend, 
with more than 135,000 tickets snapped up. But even with tickets for a 
family of four not giving you much change from £100, Andy Nyberg, the 
attraction’s chief executive, expects a million visitors this year. He 
said: ‘All of our tickets offer a no-queue experience. If you look at 
fast-track prices of other attractions, we are great value for money.’

Tickets for the Shard are ‘queue free’
because they are booked in advance, with visitors choosing the time and
date of their visit.

Among the first in at 9am yesterday 
were couple James Episcopou and Laura Taylor. They achieved another 
first – the first Shard engagement – when he proposed on Level 72.

The couple, who met through friends five years ago, were congratulated by Mr Johnson.

Mr Episcopou, 22, a Waitrose 
supermarket sales assistant, of Abridge, Essex, said: ‘It sounds corny 
but she makes me feel like I’m on top of the world. I’ve been planning 
it for a while but didn’t tell her before. I didn’t realise Boris was 
going to be here.’
