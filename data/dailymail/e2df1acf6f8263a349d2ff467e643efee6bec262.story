The husband who shot himself dead at a shooting range after his model wife was pictured cozying up to Leonardo DiCaprio was 'devastated' when his marriage to the 'love of his life' fell apart, a friend has revealed.

Katie 
Cleary was pictured cuddling up to DiCaprio and Entourage star Adrian 
Grenier last month in Cannes, before her husband Andrew Stern killed 
himself at a California shooting range on Sunday.

Now his loved ones are trying to come to terms with the death of the 40-year-oldÂ businessman, who had filed for divorce just weeks before the tragedy.

'Andrew was an amazing man and husband who believed Katie to be the love of his life,' his friend Pace Lattin told MailOnline.

'He
 made it clear that he would do anything to make her happy... He saw 
that he put all he could into his marriage and his wife, and when she 
wanted more, it devastated him.'

Another friend told MailOnline that he was already on a dark descent when he realized he couldn't hold on to his 'dream girl'.

'Andrew changed at the beginning of the year,' the source told MailOnline. 'He worked more and socialized less. He began investing even more money and more time into his charity and fundraising work... He got sad. Sadder.'

The friend explained that something was 'broken' in him and no matter how he tried to fight it - with eating well, exercise or counseling sessions - he couldn't shake it.

His struggling married to Cleary was not to blame for his suicide but just added to his pain because of the fantasy he had about their life together, the friend said.

'But the marriage wasn't based on pure, unadulterated, love. Wasn't solely based on the forever do us part love,' the source said. 'He knew what he was getting into when he started even dating Katie. She's too pretty. She's just too pretty. And she's just too charismatic and affable and kind that Andrew knew he couldn't keep her to himself.

'I'm not saying Katie did anything. If she did, I didn't know about it. But he couldn't really have her like he wanted her. Like his fantasy of her. He would talk about her in ideal terms. He idolized her and wanted her to himself, maybe a little too much. He wouldn't show it. He gave her all the freedom she wanted for her career. But he realized he wasn't the only one with eyes for her and wanting her and it deepened his pain.'

'I do 
remember him sharing that a very famous actor that Katie was working 
with was calling her cell and he saw her phone,' the source said. 'So he knew that he was in for a downhill plummet.'

Cleary's father, Thomas, who lives just outside Chicago in Illinois, told MailOnline that his daughter was devastated by her husband's death.

'This is a terrible loss for my daughter Katie and obviously she is devastated,' he said. 'We are all grieving for her and for my son-in-law.'

Mr Stern 
had filed court papers to end the couple's less-than-four-year marriage 
just weeks before the images emerged, according to court documents, and
 Cleary and Stern were still in the process of dividing up their assets when he took his life.

Cleary
 and Stern, who had appeared on 
Bravo's dating show Millionaire Matchmaker, married the model on July 
31, 2010. The court documents state the pair separated on April 3, 2014.

The 
divorce papers read: 'The exact nature and extent of [Stern's] separate 
assets including, without limitation, funds and/or other property 
interests due to [Stern] from [Cleary] by way of recoupment, 
misappropriation... are presently under determination.'

Cleary's rep told TMZ the
 couple broke up eight months ago and that the pictures of Cleary getting close to DiCaprio and Grenier were harmless.

Getting acquainted: Sources said that Cleary and Stern were going through a divorce, which added to his stress

The rep explained that Cleary and Grenier had been 
friends for sometime, while Cleary and Dicaprico had only 
met the night they were photographed - but the rep insisted they were innocently 
discussing animal conservation and nothing else.

However, the celebrity website cites sources as saying Stern felt embarrassed by the pictures and was suffering depression.

Interviews
 with the couple's friends revealed he was stressed over his marital problems and had a history of depression, TMZ earlier reported, while others said he had financial strains.

But
 his friend Pace Lattin denied Stern was in serious financial trouble, 
saying that the couple's house was paid for and his family was 'well 
off'.

'Maybe
 he wasn't as rich as some of the Stars his wife was fooling around with
 but he was rich with real friends,' Lattin said on Facebook.

He
 added to MailOnline: 'While he did fight with depression his entire 
life, it's partially because he put so much passion into everything he 
did.'

In addition, fresh claims have emerged on TMZ that
 Stern had a history of injecting human growth hormones and the male 
hormone testosterone in a bid to boost a waning libido.

Friends
 said the treatment, prescribed by a health and wellness centre in 
Beverly Hills, made him irritable and prone to drastic mood swings.

Stern was said to have kept it up for a year until stopping using the treatment suddenly.

But
 after going cold turkey from the drugs, he was said to have sunk into a
 deep depression, which was only made worse after the failure of his 
business and his marriage problems.

On Tuesday it emerged that two other men had taken their lives at the same shooting range in the past five years.

Stern shot himself in the head at the Target Range in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, and according to local reports another man killed himself there just 10 weeks ago.

The unidentified man in his 50s shot himself in the chest at the indoor shooting range on April 6.

Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene, according to CBS LA.

And
 in November 2009 a man in his 30s was reportedly wounded at the range 
and died at hospital about two hours later, an archive Los Angeles Daily
 News report says.

The latest tragedy
 comes just four weeks after 32-year-old Cleary was pictured getting 
close to DiCaprio at the Gotha nightclub in Cannes.

The
 pair were seen chatting and dancing closely, while DiCaprio was 
pictured whispering into the model's ear. The apparent closeness came 
even though DiCaprio is dating Victoria's Secret model Toni Garrn.

Katie, who 
is from Glenview, Illinois, appeared on the first series of America's 
Next Top Model while she was still a college student, before landing the
 role of 'briefcase beauty' on popular game show Deal Or No Deal.

The
 brunette beauty has since had minor roles in The Break Up, Iron Man 2 
and Entourage, while appearing in advertising campaigns for Sketchers, 
Nike and Elastiderm.

She was also spotted out and about with Entourage cast member Adrian Grenier while in Cannes.

Stern had set up his own successful marketing firm after graduating from Miami University in Oxford, 
Ohio and moving to Los Angeles.

Initially
 working for other companies, he started his career with the Los Angeles
 Lakers, Taco Bell, Southwest Airlines and Pepsi, according to an obituary posted on Performance Marketing Insider by a business friend, Pace Lattin.

After
 working with professional athletes including Kobe Bryant and Anna 
Kournikova at Broadband Sports, he joined L90 Worldwide as a sales and 
media planner, it noted.

In 2002, he founded Seed Corn Advertising and went on to produce movies, launch 
restaurants, real estate and 'brokering exotic cars', the obituary said.

He also featured on Season 2 of the hit TV show 'Millionaire Matchmaker' before marrying Cleary, 'the love of his life', Lattin wrote.

'Andrew kept his original company, never sold out, always was making money and working hard,' he wrote.

'We both started in the industry at the same time, and his passing makes me extremely sad. We were both young kids in this industry, and grew up making money in this industry - and everyone I know did business with him at one time or another.'
