Speaking out: Kimberley Wilson has revealed that she was subjected to abuse from viewers of The Great British Bake Off

A finalist in The Great British Bake Off says she was told to 'know her place' by viewers who abused her online while the hit BBC2 series was on air.

Kimberley Wilson blames the simplistic way producers portrayed her for the harsh reception - and suggests that women were more vitriolic than men towards the female contestants.

The 30-year-old psychologist is not the first of this year's finalists to complain about her treatment by viewers - Ruby Tandoh said she received an 'extraordinary amount of bitterness and bile' on social media during the show, whose fourth series concluded in October.

Miss Wilson and Miss Tandoh reached the final of the baking contest, judged by Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry, but were beaten by eventual winner Frances Quinn.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World at One, Miss Wilson revealed that she was sent dozens of message accusing her of being arrogant and responding badly to criticism.

She said that viewers told her: 'I was too self-satisfied, I was too confident and cocky and cocksure and I wasn't showing enough vulnerability, I wasn't showing enough deference, I wasn't being gracious enough.

'I read comments which said I should know my place. That was really quite an interesting response to what I went into thinking was just a baking show. It felt political.'

Despite suggestions of a misogynistic bias against the three women who made it to this year's final, Miss Wilson said that many of the most virulent abuse came from female viewers.

'I would say the harshest critics of the guys on the Bake Off would be women sat on their sofas talking to each other saying "She looks a bit fat in that" or "I don't think she's done a very good job of her jam tarts." I think it's women who are actually the harshest critics.

'There's a danger when you talk about a gender bias, you imagine it's men attacking women, whereas I think actually women can be the real damage to a kind of perceived sisterhood that never existed.'

She added: 'What you got was a kind of condensed, slightly two-dimensional representation of what happened. Nothing was fictionalised, but it wasn't fully nuanced.

'I was presented as kind of uber-confident and uber-competent, which is probably just not human. That becomes a bit of a problem in terms of viewers watching it because it becomes a little bit unnatural and there was a little bit of repercussion for me in terms of that.'

'Misogyny': Miss Tandoh, known for her emotional persona, has previously described the abuse she received from online viewers

Miss Wilson said that some viewers may have seen her as particularly confident thanks to her training as a psychologist - but she insisted that her career in fact made her more vulnerable.

'One of the producers did say, "You don't seem to be too riled by some of the things the judges say, you don't seem to get very upset about things. Is it something about your job which means you have a thick skin?''

'Actually, I think it's completely the opposite. I'm a psychologist, part of my job is about taking criticism every single day. I sit in supervision and my work is taken apart line by line verbatim in sessions. I've sat in therapy and I've looked at myself and I understand myself.

'It's about not just pushing criticism away in a kind of defensive stance. It's about partly understanding what's being picked up on and, painfully, is there any truth in it, is there any reality in it and if so can you deal with that?'

In a blistering article written just after the end of the show, Miss Tandoh - known for her emotional persona on the show - hit out at the 'personal vitriol and misogyny' which she said she had received from some viewers.

'Despite the saccharine sweetness of the Bake Off, an extraordinary amount of bitterness and bile has spewed forth every week from angry commentators, both on social media and in the press,' she wrote.
