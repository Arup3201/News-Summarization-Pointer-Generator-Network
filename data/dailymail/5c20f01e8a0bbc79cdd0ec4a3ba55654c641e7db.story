There's no doubt that the selfie has become a bona fide cultural phenomenon, flooding the internet and social networking sites on an hourly basis. 

But it appears some selfie-goers are still a little confused about when it is and isn't appropriate to whip out the camera phone for a self-portrait. 

From the onlooker who posed cheerily at the scene of the Sydney siege, to the teen who took a solo shot in front of the dead relative's casket, we show you the world's stupidest selfies. 

Dearly departed? This smirking youth's dead gran is in the casket behind him - but he still poses for a selfie

Hostage to hilarity: This onlooker seemed disturbingly cheerful as he posed out the café siege in Sydney earlier this month

Another flaming narcissist: A cheesy grin while U.S. firemen battle a raging blaze in the background 

He's no hotshot: Eastbourne's burning pier is an obvious photo-op for this young man 

Holocaust horror: The girl's smile is out of place at Auschwitz (left) while two other young women have apparently forgotten they are in front of Berlin's Memorial To The Murdered Jews Of Europe (right) 

All at sea: Ferdinand Puentes was lucky to survive this plane crash near Hawaii. One passenger died 

Jumping in: An apparently suicidal youth is talked down from Brooklyn Bridge in NYC while a woman takes a tactless phone photo 

Too clinical: Donning her obligatory scrubs, a U.S. medic sees this triple bypass as ideal Instagram material 

Affront: The smiling sunbather posted 'Spending time with my nana on this lovely Sunday!' while holding an urn presumably containing some of her ashes 

Keep calm and carry on posing: Meanwhile, there's mayhem as the jet airliner fills with smoke 

Not waving but drowning: The youth's in trouble, but the poser is unruffled by the scene
