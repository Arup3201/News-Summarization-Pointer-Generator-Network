Labour is suffering from ‘squeaky bum time’ in the race to win the next election, a shadow cabinet minister has admitted.

Sadiq Khan’s admission, using the phrase made famous by the former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, comes amid growing pressure on Ed Miliband’s leadership in the wake of a series of poor polls.

It comes as Mr Miliband attempted to bolster his election war chest – by selling off bizarre eco-friendly shopping bags emblazoned with a ‘Vote Labour’ ceramic lion logo designed by the artist Grayson Perry.

Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said it was 'squeaky bum time' for the party ahead of the next general election

In an email, party members are offered the chance to ‘donate £19 towards a Labour victory now, and you'll get your very own, special-edition Grayson Perry canvas bag/work of art’.

Labour is facing being heavily outspent by the Tories in the election campaign and is relying on large donations from the unions to compete.

The Tory Party’s financial muscle is adding to growing Labour concern that it is not far enough ahead in the polls to win a majority in May.

Mr Khan said it was time for MPs concerned about Mr Miliband’s leadership to ‘get on the pitch and help us’ instead of ‘complaining from the sidelines’.

Cross-dressing artist Grayson Perry is a long-time supporter of the Labour Party.

His £19 eco-friendly ‘Vote Labour’ shopping bag uses an image of a ceramic lion which he donated to the party in July.

The ornament was sold for £42,000 at a star-studded Labour fundraising event attended by left-wing actors, artists and TV stars.

Star Trek actor Patrick Stewart, Bianca Jagger and Stephen Fry attended the fundraising ‘gala’ dinner.

At the gala, one bidder is understood to have pledged more than £105,000 for artist Antony Gormley's 'Small Turn III' - a 106cm pillar of blocks made of cast iron.

Asked if he had seen evidence of unrest within Labour ranks, Mr Khan told the Guardian: ‘There's a great Alex Ferguson saying ... where in a season when Man United and Newcastle were neck-and-neck, he said it's squeaky bum time. And I think it's squeaky bum time for Labour.’

He added that in the past whenever Labour had lost an election, the party spends a lengthy period in opposition during which ‘we fight among ourselves and often spilt’.

But he said: ‘What we're trying to do is something not done since 1974 - that's to be a one-term opposition and bounce back from the second worst result in our history.

‘Some of my colleagues need to recognise there's no rule of politics that means you bounce back like a pendulum.

‘You've got to have the humility to learn the right lessons, be proud of the things you got right and earn it.

‘We lost really badly and people forget that. But we're competitive again, and we've a great set of candidates and policies. Politics is a team sport. It's really easy to blame the leader.

‘We've all got a role to play ... rather than people complaining on the sidelines, they should get on the pitch and help us win the election.’

Mr Khan claimed some of his colleagues had failed to ‘understand the rhythm of opposition’ in the new fixed-term parliament era, while the leadership was working backwards from the May 7 election date with a plan to win.

Acknowledging the threat of division to Labour's chances, he appealed for calm to make sure the party did not ‘wake up on May 8 saying “if only we'd been more united, if only we'd been more disciplined”’.

A ComRes poll for the Sunday Mirror and Independent on Sunday put the party on 34 per cent, four points ahead of the Tories.

But only 20 per cent of those surveyed said they could imagine Mr Miliband as prime minister, a fall from 25 per cent a year ago.
