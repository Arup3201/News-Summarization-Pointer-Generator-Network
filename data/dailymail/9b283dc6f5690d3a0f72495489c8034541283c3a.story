Toddlers pushed around town in buggies are 'vulnerable' to car pollution, a Cabinet minister warned today.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey said parents had raised fears with him that the pollution from busy roads was damaging their children's health.

He said the level of harmful diesel soot pumped out of exhaust pipes near children was dangerous.

In an interview with The Evening Standard, the top Lib Dem called singled out London Mayor Boris Johnson for particular criticism.

He urged the Tory Mayor to step up the battle against dirty air with a quicker switch to electric vehicles.

Mr Davey called on the Mayor put 'smog alerts' on bus stops to alert families to the danger of venturing out.

The Lib Dem accused Mr Johnson of 'flim-flamming about' on improving air quality. Mr Davey stressed children were particularly at risk from traffic pollution.

He said: 'If you had electric vehicles, they would not be exposed. If you had low emission vehicles, they would not be exposed.

'But at the moment they are vulnerable if they are being pushed down congested high streets. In a buggy they are at near exhaust pipe level.

'It’s vital for the health of our children that we take this issue far more seriously.'

He accused the Mayor of 'not delivering' on a pledge to put London at the forefront of the electric car revolution. 'London needs to go electric and we need to start with the buses,' he added.

'Boris’ record on electric buses is hopeless.'

But Mr Johnson’s allies blamed the Government - and even Mr Davey himself - for ignoring the Mayor's pleas for help.

One ally said: 'This is the same Climate Change Secretary who has repeatedly ignored Boris’ entreaties to help us improve air quality.'

The Mayor’s senior environmental adviser Matthew Pencharz insisted Mr Johnson was delivering the most ambitious set of measures in the world to tackle air pollution, including an ultra low emission zone.

He said: 'He is pulling every lever that he can – it’s not unreasonable to ask the Government to do its bit too.

'Since being elected, he has driven down emissions across London, leading to a halving of the number of people living in areas with poor air quality.'

But Mr Davey accused Mr Johnson of being 'lackadaisical'.

He said: 'If there is a smog problem in London, he should be looking every single way possible to get that message over to people.

'If they have got asthma, they can take mitigating effects. If they want to help out, they can change their transport plans – so maybe they would say "alright I’ll work at home".'
