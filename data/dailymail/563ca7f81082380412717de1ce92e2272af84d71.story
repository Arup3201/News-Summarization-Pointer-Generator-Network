Newly-released surveillance footage shows the dramatic scene inside an elevator the night an off-duty Kentucky cop accidentally shot himself in the stomach after fumbling with his weapon. 

The video shows Officer Darryl Jouett and his wife entering an elevator at the Mercer Commons parking garage in Cincinnati,Ohio after a dinner date on Friday night.

Jouett then reaches into his jacket to remove his semiautomatic handgun, and struggles to readjust the weapon in its holster while balancing the boxes in his other hand. 

The gun is then seen discharging before falling to the floor, as Jouett clutches his side and slumps to a kneeling position.  

Mistake: Erlanger, Kentucky Police Officer Darryl Jouett was returning from dinner with his wife on Friday when he accidentally shot himself in an elevator. Recently released surveillance footage from the elevator shows the accident as it happened 

Triggered: Cincinnati Police say Jouett was readjusting the gun in its holster when he accidentally triggered the weapon and a bullet ricocheted to hit his stomach 

Somebody help: The surveillance footage shows Jouett's wife leaving the elevator to frantically dial 911 for help 

'He was transitioning the holster and transitioning the gun out of his holster,' Cincinnati Cpat Michael John explained.  'He was going to carry it in his hand as they walked to the car. As he was pulling the gun from the holster, a round discharged, ricocheted in the elevator, struck him in the stomach.' 

Jouett's shocked wife is then seen frantically dialing 911, and exiting the elevator to get a signal. 

While the cop struggles on the floor of the elevator, he eventually gets enough strength to stand up and leave. 

Jouett was taken to University  of Cincinnati Medical Center where he was treated for non life-threatening injuries. 

On Monday, Jouett told WCPO that he is now recovering at home and has been instructed not to speak out about the incident. 

Jouett has 25 years of law enforcement experience with the Erlanger Police Department.
