Poppy Delevingne has been busy focussing on her wedding and life as a newlywed so she's handed over one of her modelling duties to good friend Alexa Chung.

Queen of cool Alexa has today been unveiled as the new face of Nails Inc, who called on the model to help celebrate its 15th anniversary.

Always one to throw her all into a collaboration, as the AW14 face, IT girl Alexa has given the nail polish brand a high fashion makeover.

New face: Alexa Chung has been unveiled as the face - and hands - of Nails Inc. The model replaces good friend Poppy Delevingne as the face of the beauty brand

The 30-year-old has posed for the brand's fashion-led campaign, shot by industry heavyweight Rankin, will act as a brand ambassador and has even created a range of fabric inspired polishes, which will launch in August 2014. Prepare for a stampede.

Thea Green, founder and MD of Nails inc said: 'Fashion is at the heart of Nails inc and we're well known for colour, innovation and amazing fashion effects for nails.

'Our Leather effect polish, as worn by Alexa Chung to the 2012 British Fashion Awards was a sell-out with a wait list of more than 3,000.

'There's a real synergy with our brand and Alexa collaborating was a natural evolution of our relationship with her.'

Debuting housed in Nails inc's new bottle designed by Creative Director Fabien Baron, the range of six polishes aim to embrace a new era of fashion forward fabric effects for nails, which Nails Inc have been championing with their leather, concrete and feather effect polishes over the years.

Speaking about her new job, Alexa said: 'It was Nails Inc's array of bold, fresh colours that first caught my eye. Then I wore Nails inc's black leather polish a few years ago and I fell in love with the brand.

'When Thea asked me to collaborate I was so excited - not only am I the face of the brand but we've created an amazing collection of fabric inspired polishes. I've been playing with textures and innovative effects to create the perfect collection that girls can use to revitalise an outfit. This collection is a party for your hands.'

Alexa has created a range of £15 polishes starting with a classic lace effect red called Alexa Lace In Red.

There's also Alexa Cashmere In Mink and the model has fused warming mink shades of matte polish with pure glass pearls to provide a subtle sheen and cashmere texture.

'For me fashion is all about texture and colour. I love cashmere, it's so luxurious. My favourite feeling is pulling on a cashmere sweater,' she said about her inspiration behind the polishes.

Remember when? Alexa Chung was pictured wearing Nails Inc.'s leather effect nail polish at the British Fashion Awards in 2012 before it had been released to the public and it went on to sell out

Lady in red: Alexa has created a range of £15 polishes starting with a classic lace effect red called Alexa Lace In Red, which will pre-launch online in June for £12

Fashion's darling: Her style is so well respected that Mulberry named a bag after her, the much sought-after Alexa, which sold out

Speaking about Alexa Silk In Black, which is inspired by Alexa's love of the brand's black leather polish, she said: 'I'm a huge fan of the black leather polish. It was my favourite look on the shoot. The effect is so cool and I love the matte texture. I'd wear it with a breton t-shirt for an edgier look.'

Alexa Sequins in Black and Gold aims to give the effect of an 'amazing' sequin dress. 'My favourite polish in the collection is sequins. Its classic and easy to team with lots of different outfits. Often I dress relaxed and in a tomboy kind of way, so it's nice to have a little disco on my nails,' she said.

And finally, Alexa Camouflage blends a mix of green and nude metallic and matte particles to create a cool camouflage effect for the nails.

Alexa kickstarted her career at 16 when 
she was signed to Storm models, the agency that has Kate Moss and Cara 
Delevingne on its books. She moved into TV in 2006, presenting the music
 show Popworld in 2006 with Alex Zane, before becoming a staple of the 
now-defunct T4.

It wasn’t 
long before Alexa’s tomboyish style earned her some serious fashion 
stripes and she was seated front row at every major fashion show, 
featured on countless fashion magazine covers and landed modelling 
campaigns for New Look, Pepe Jeans and Superga.

Mulberry named a bag after her, the much sought-after Alexa, which sold out. She is now contributing editor at Vogue UK, for which she recently 
interviewed cover star Kate Upton, and has her own eye make-up range for Eyeko.
