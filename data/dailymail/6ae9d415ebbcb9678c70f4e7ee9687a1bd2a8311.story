A multi-million dollar Hollywood movie is scrapping its promotional campaign - over fears it could be deemed insensitive following the shooting of black teen Trayvon Martin.

Twentieth Century Fox has pulled the trailer for its comedy Neighborhood Watch because actor Jonah Hill's character makes a gun motion out of a car window.

It has also axed a bullet riddled promotional poster for the film about a group of suburban fathers who become neighbourhood watch volunteers and end up battling aliens.

Scrapped: Twentieth Century Fox has pulled this poster for Neighbourhood Watch because it could be deemed 'insensitive' in light of Trayvon Martin's shooting

Uproar: Trayvon Martin's (left) death prompted anger as George Zimmerman (right) has never been arrested

Banned: The trailer has also been consigned to the bin because actor Jonah Hill's character makes a gun motion out of a car window

The decision was taken after the 17-year-old was gunned down by neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, 28, last month.

Zimmerman claims he acted in self-defence after being sucker-punched by the teen in a gated community in Sanford, Florida.

The fact Zimmerman was never arrested has sparked outrage across the country and roiled race relations. Tens of thousands of protesters have marched at rallies across the U.S.

Confusion now surrounds exactly what happened - with details emerging of the gunman's criminal past, and Trayvon's history of truancy, drugs and graffiti.

Stars: The film pairs Vince Vaughn with Ben Stiller once again. The duo appeared in the smash hit comedy Dodgeball

A Fox spokesman said: 'We are very 
sensitive to the Trayvon Martin case, but our film is a broad alien 
invasion comedy and bears absolutely no relation to the tragic events in
Florida.

'The movie, which is not scheduled for release for several months, was made and these initial marketing materials were released before this incident ever came to light.

'The teaser materials were part of an early phase of our marketing and were never planned for long term use.'

Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller, whose 2004 film Dodgeball raked in $115million at the U.S. box office, are joined by British comedian Richard Ayoade star for the movie.

Fox said the posters for the July release were taken out of Florida cinemas this week and would be removed from those across the U.S. in the coming days.

Moving on: The second stage of the promotional campaign, to be launched shortly, will focus on the 'alien invasion component of the film

They will be replaced with simple images of the cast. The second stage of the promotional campaign, to be launched shortly, will focus on the 'alien invasion component of the film', it added.

It is not the first time a news event has scuppered promotion of a film.

Clint Eastwood's Hereafter, featuring a tsunami, was pulled from the Japanese market by Warner Bros after last year's natural disaster.

And the British release for V for Vendetta was delayed in 2005 after the London tube bombings eerily echoed a key plot point in the vigilante-themed film.
