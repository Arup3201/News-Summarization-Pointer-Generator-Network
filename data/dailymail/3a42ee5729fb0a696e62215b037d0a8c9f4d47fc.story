The Florida Supreme Court disbarred a former circuit judge on Thursday for having a 'personal and emotional relationship' with a prosecutor that started during a death penalty case he was trying before her.

The seven high court justices voted unanimously to toughen the penalty recommended by a hearing officer, who had called for a one-year suspension of Judge Ana Gardiner.

The high court said such an ethical lapse in a capital case that later resulted in a death sentence being reduced to life in prison, and her initial efforts to downplay her involvement with assistant state attorney Howard Scheinberg, required her disbarment.

Disbarred: Anna Gardiner was officially kicked out of the legal profession on Thursday for failing to disclose the personal relationship she started with homicide prosecutor Howard Scheinberg while presiding over a murder trial he was leading in 2007. Gardiner is pictured here testifying in 2012

Suspended: While trying a death-penalty case before Judge Ana Gardiner in 2007, Howard Scheinberg, 53, exchanged 949 phone calls and 471 text messages with the judge and has been suspended from practicing law for two years for the relationship

Homicide: Omar Loureiro was on trial for the stabbing murder of James Lentry, 57, in Lighthouse Point on New Years Day in 2001. After Gardiner sentenced him to death in 2007, it was revealed she had shared a relationship with the lead prosecutor in the case, Howard Scheinberg. Loureiro was granted a retrial and sentenced to life in prison

The court said Gardiner had a chance meeting with Scheinberg at a restaurant during the murder trial of Omar Loureiro in 2007, and they joined some others at a bar after dinner.

Between March 23, several days before a jury returned a guilty verdict against Loureiro, and August 24, when she sentenced him to death, the court said Gardiner and Scheinberg exchanged 949 cell phone calls and 471 text messages.

Loureiro was charged with the fatal stabbing of James Lentry, 57, in Lighthouse Point on New Years Day in 2001.

He had claimed Lentry made unwanted and aggressive sexual advances toward him.

When the Judicial Qualifications Commission began an investigation in late 2008, the court said Gardiner 'failed to disclose the honest and true nature of her relationship with Scheinberg' during Louriero's trial.

It was not until the following April, when the Broward state attorney was investigating, that Gardiner 'acknowledged for the first time her ongoing emotional relationship with Scheinberg'.

According to The Sun Sentinel, the relationship between Gardiner and Scheinberg was not romantic.

Ana Gardiner resigned from the Broward Circuit Court bench in 2010 after serving for 11 years. She now has 30 days to close out her Fort Lauderdale law practice after being disbarred on Thursday

She resigned from the bench in 2010, after 11 years as a judge.

In 2013 Gardiner married David Bogenschutz, who acted as her attorney during the Scheinberg investigation.

The Supreme Court suspended Scheinberg from practice for two years.

He will be allowed to return to the practice of law in 2015.

After the relationship between judge and prosecutor became known, Loureiro got a new trial and his sentence was reduced from death to life in prison.

'Considering Gardiner's dishonest conduct and the harm that her actions have caused to the administration of justice in a capital first-degree murder case, we conclude that disbarment is the appropriate action,' said the Supreme Court order.

The court also ordered her to pay $8,117.18 in costs.
