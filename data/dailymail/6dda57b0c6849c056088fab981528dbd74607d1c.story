A 15-month-old baby has survived falling from an 11th floor balcony, after he narrowly missed hitting a pavement and instead landed on a soft bed of soil.

Toddler Musa Dayib is now in a critical but stable condition after falling from the high-rise Riverside Plaza Apartments in Minneapolis, U.S, where he lived with his family.

The boy suffered serious injuries and is said to be in a critical but stable condition at Hennepin County Medical Center, where his parents continue to keep a bedside vigil.

Musa Dayib, who is 15 months old, is in a critical but stable condition after falling from the 11th floor of the high-rise Riverside Plaza Apartments in Minneapolis, U.S, where he lived with his family

But neighbours are amazed that the boy - who was said to be conscious when he was found at the bottom of the high-rise building - survived the shocking fall.

The toddler avoided hitting a pavement more than 100 feet below and a steal box by inches, in what one doctor described as 'a gift from God'.

Dr Tina Slusher from the pediatric intensive care unit the hospital said: 'If you and I fell that far, we would be dead.'

The tragedy unfolded after the baby's 
father Guled Ahmed quickly went to the kitchen while he was playing with
 his two children, according to the Star Tribune.

Less than one minute later, his three-year-old 
daughter ran into the kitchen saying: 'the baby fell'.

Sahra 
Dayib, Mr Ahmed’s sister, said her brother looked over the balcony 
railing and saw Musa lying on the ground 11 storeys below.

He grabbed his daughter and ran down the stairs to reach his son - who was conscious and crying - as quickly as possible.

Dr Slusher said: 'He’s a baby and he happened to land on a very small patch of mulchy area.

'He’s a kid so they tend to be more flexible and pliable than you and I would be. Having said that, it’s a real gift from God that he made it because this is a huge fall.'

Neighbour Abdirizak Bihi said he and his daughters were out 
for a walk Sunday night when they saw the commotion outside the building.

When news spread about the toddler’s horrific fall, neighbours gathered to see what they could do to help the little boy.

Musa was then taken to hospital, where he was treated for his injuries, including concussion, bruising to the lung and fractures in his ribs, backbone and arms.

Mr Bihi said: 'When people found out he survived, no one could believe it.

'I’m more concerned about his dad and his mother. They’re devastated. They can’t even speak.

'It took place in less than a minute. The grandmother told me that the daughter opened the balcony door. This is such a tragedy. The parents are blaming themselves.'

Bihi said the Somali-American community is trying to help the mother and father to focus on the miraculous survival of their son.

Neighbours also pledged to set up a fund for the family, as they come to terms with the horrific incident.

In a statement released by hospital 
officials, the parents said they were thankful for the 'continued 
prayers for Musa and his family at this time'.

After the incident, owners of the Riverside Plaza apartments met with community members to talk about measures to stop small children opening the patio doors.

Neighbour Larry Ross described how the young boy was crying and had narrowly missed the pavement and a large steel box of housing electric equipment.

Mr Ahmed's brother Abdirahim Ahmed - who said the lock on the family's patio door was broken - also told the meeting that his brother was 'terrified' but was a 'good dad'.

He said: 'We’re just praying that he’s OK.'

The toddler is said to be in a critical but stable condition after the fall, which happened while the young boy was playing in the apartment with his sister and father

Matt Lindstrom, a spokesman for the city, said the balconies at Riverside Plaza exceed the state's requirements.

George Sherman, whose family owns and manages the complex, said new patio doors, screens and locks were added to the high-rise buildings during a recent $65 million renovation.

On request, the building’s managers provide wood blocks that can be placed in the patio door’s track to prevent the door from being opened, he added.

He also said he wanted to learn and respond to the tragedy.

After the meeting, he said he would look at adding childproof latches above a child’s reach provided fire officials approve.

In 1998, a 23-month-old boy died after falling six floors out of a window on the estate.

After that, the windows were changed so they didn't full open, Mr Sherman said.
