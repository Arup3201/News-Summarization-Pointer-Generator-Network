Authorities in Louisiana are looking for a man who they say shot and killed his 25-year-old girlfriend early Sunday and then went on the run with his three children, one of whom is the 2-year-old son of the victim.

Police responded to a medical call  in the 4000 block of Durand Street in Metarie at about 3:35 a.m. Sunday after two of the victim's children from a previous relationship - ages 5 and 8 - ran to a neighbor's house to to report that something was wrong with their mother.

When authorities arrived, they found the unidentified victim dead in a bathrtub. Police say she appears to have died of blunt-force trauma to the head.

Wanted: Pedro Alberto Monterroso-Navas is on the run with his three children after allegedly murdering his girlfriend

After allegedly killing the woman, Pedro Alberto Monterroso-Navas fled with three of his children, including his daughter, 12-year-old Jessica 
Nicolle Monterroso, and two sons, 4-year-old Yojan Manuel 
Monterroso-Flores and 2-year-old Jafet Abigaitl Monterroso-Monroy, who is also the son of the victim.

WWLTV reports that Monterroso-Navas doesn't own a vehicle, and it's unclear what means of transportation he used to flee with the children.

Monterroso-Navas is described as a 43-year-old Hispanic male with brown hair.

Authorities say he also
 goes by the name Wilson Rigoberto Mina.

Monterroso-Navas walks with a limp, and was last seen wearing black 
pants and a blue shirt.

According to the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, Monterroso-Navas is in the United States illegally.

Authorities say that Monterroso-Navas will likely be charged with second-degree murder when he is apprehended.

The victim is yet to be publicly identified. Authorities say her identity will be revealed only after the coroner's office notified her family about her death.

Anyone with information about the crime or Monterroso-Navas' whereabouts are asked to call the Jefferson Parish Sheriffâ€™s Office at 504-364-5300.
