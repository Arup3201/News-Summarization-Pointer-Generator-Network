The minimum wage should be increased by more than 10 per cent as part of a drive to force up pay for all workers, senior Liberal Democrats said today.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said the £6.19 hourly rate for adult workers had been outstripped by the rising cost of living and was now worth the same in real terms as in 2004.

And Treasury minister Danny Alexander said the Government would put pressure on employers to end years of pay freezes to ensure all staff enjoy the economic recovery.

The Lib Dem annual conference gets under 
way in Glasgow today with a heavy focus on jobs and wages, with the 
coalition under pressure to improve living standards as the economic 
growth builds momentum.

In a co-ordinated series of announcements, senior Lib Dem ministers lined up to promise more help to push up wages.

Latest figures show that while the CPI rate of inflation shows the cost of living rising by 2.8 per cent, earnings are only 1.1 per cent up on this time last year.

But with a run of strong economic indicators and Chancellor George Osborne boasting the economics has ’turned a corner’, ministers are under pressure to show ordinary people will start to see an improvement in their own incomes.

Treasury Chief Secretary Mr Alexander insisted workers should share in the success of business.

Recovery: Nick Clegg will tonight describe how his party helped secure the current economic boost

He told the Daily Telegraph: ’It's not for me as a Treasury minister to start telling employers what their pay policies should be, that's a matter for firms.

’But of course, as growth returns to our economy and we see businesses being successful, the workforce will want to and should share in that success.’

However, Mr Alexander warned any pay rises would only be seen in the private sector, wi several years more of austerity for public sector staff.

’We are going to have to continue controlling spending to ensure the country stays on the right track,’ he said.

The idea is likely to attract scepticism form many employers who are still struggling to stay afloat.

The Federation of Small Businesses has warned that many small firms are still unable to obtain loans from banks to take expand or invest in staff.

However the Government could boost pay across the board by dramatically increasing the minimum wage.

The Lib Dems are also committed to raising the income tax threshold to ensure that people on the minimum wage pay no tax at all, although this would be a pledge for the 2015 election.

Mr Cable, the Business Secretary, said is to ask the Low Pay Commission to restore its value, which he calculates has fallen in real terms by 10-12 per cent since the crash of 2008, He told the Guardian: ’We cannot go on for ever in a low pay and low productivity world in which all we can say to workers is “you have got to take a wage cut to keep your job”.’

The measures to combat low pay will also involve steps to tackle the abuses of zero-hours contracts.

Mr Cable added: ’We have got to enter into a different kind of workplace.

’For a very long time, five or six years, wages have been suppressed in low wage sectors. I am sending a signal that we are entering a very different environment.’

After a series of dire opinion calls, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg will tonight seek to claim credit for his party’s role in securing the economic recovery.

Potential: The Lib Dems are expected to announce plans to combat youth unemployment

While he is expected to use the conference to target his Tory coalition partners’ attempts to tear up employment laws, he will highlight a Lib Dem drive to create a million new jobs in the economy.

At a rally in Glasgow tonight he will say: ’We are the ones that can campaign as the party of jobs.

’We are the only party that believes in releasing the potential of everyone, creating a society where everybody gets a fair chance in life.

’And that means making sure they get the opportunity to find work.

’We know that unemployment isn't just about statistics or a rising bill for benefits.

’It's about ambitions thwarted, potential frustrated, and the spirit-crushing sense that you are not being allowed to take control of your own destiny.

’And youth unemployment, where people can find themselves left on the scrapheap without even having been given the chance to prove themselves, is a scourge we must tackle.

’But the Liberal Democrats have a proud story to tell on jobs and the economy.

’We can tell people how we took the right decisions in government to make sure interest rates were kept down and to protect people from the economic crises we have seen elsewhere in Europe.’

Chuka Umunna, Labour’s shadow business secretary, said: ’Vince Cable talks about increasing the minimum wage, but you can't trust a word the Lib Dems say.

’At every turn they have supported making it easier to fire not hire people at work, and under their Government people have been left £1,500 worse off.’
