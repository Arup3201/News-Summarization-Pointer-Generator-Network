A 33-year-old man allegedly robbed a petrol station having just left them details of his name and address.

Dim-witted Anthony Thomas had moments earlier filled out an application form for a job at the station before dipping his hand into the til.

The ill-thought-out robbery was caught on the gas station's CCTV. The footage clearly showed the thief taking 
wads of notes out of an open til drawer while the cashier attended to 
other business in the store.

Police say Anthony Thomas, 33, filled out a job application at a gas station in Ocala, Florida, immediately before robbing the place

Keeping an eye-out, Thomas appears to be reaching into the til drawer

Thomas had filled out the form at 10am on Tuesday at a gas station in Ocala, Florida, before allegedly helping himself to $130, according to the Huffington Post.

The footage shows him acting casual by the desk. When the cashier has her back turned he appears to reach over and pull open a blue drawer.

He then takes what looks like wads of bank notes from inside the drawer, in between acting casual when the staff member passes by.

He then bends down, hiding away his loot, before apparently conversing with the gas station worker.

When police tried to arrest Thomas, he tried to fight them off but failed, reported WFTV.Â

Thomas allegedly said: 'I didn't rob no store,' according to the news service.

There are no reports on whether his job application was successful.
