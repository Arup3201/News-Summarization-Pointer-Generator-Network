U.S. airports, including Los Angeles International and O'Hare International in Chicago, are already experiencing delays in customs waiting lines as a result of automatic federal spending cuts, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said today.

In New York today, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said wait times for passengers on 56 arriving flights at JFK International exceeded two hours, and passengers on 14 flights waited more than three hours.

CBP said in a statement later Monday that weekend delays in Los Angeles and Chicago were caused by "reduced primary booth staffing" because of cuts to overtime.

Delays at Miami International Airport of more than two hours were reported for 51 flights, and passengers from four flights experienced waits of about three hours.

CBP said such waits were longer than usual.

The big-city airports routinely suffer security line delays already, but the delays will become worse Napolitano said at a Politico-sponsored event on the 10th anniversary of DHS.

However there were no significant flight delays from LAX or Chicago, The Federal Aviation Administration reported on Monday.

The Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection agencies, which are part of the Homeland Security Department, are in the process of issuing furlough notices and have cut overtime for employees.

TSA, which is responsible for screening passengers entering airports, said travelers can expect longer security checkpoint lines as the agency reduces overtimes and freezes hiring.

TSA said in a statement that it expects to have about 1,000 vacancies by Memorial Day and as many as 2,600 by the end of the budget year in September.

Napolitano said she expects a cascading effect during the week, with wait times expected to double in worst cases.
