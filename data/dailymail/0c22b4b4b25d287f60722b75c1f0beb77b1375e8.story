A husband and wife have admitted cooking up a large batch of marijuana butter and supplying it to four corrections officers.

Timothy Scherzer 48, and Alyssa Scherzer, 43, from Kent County, Michigan, claim they are both medical marijuana caregivers and that the officers are their patients.

Longtime Kent County corrections officers Michael Frederick, Todd VanDoorne, Timothy Bernhardt and Brian Tennant were arrested in March after a late-night interrogation by police.

Post office employees had tipped-off Kent Area Narcotics Enforcement Team officers about a suspicious package being sent to an undisclosed address.

Investigators said they do not believe any of the substance entered the jail or that any of the inmates were involved.

Cannabis butter is made by cooking ground cannabis buds before straining out the plant matter and allowing the liquid to set.

THC, the active ingredient in cannabis binds with the fat, to create a product that can be easily used in cooking or as a spread.

A search warrant affidavit in Kent County Circuit Court files reveals Timothy Scherzer told police he is a patient as well as a caregiver.

He said his patients were Michael Frederick and Todd VanDoorne as well as Christine Tennant, the wife of Deputy Brian Tennant.

Alyssa Scherzer said she was the caregiver of Timothy Bernhardt, of Rockford.

Mr Scherzer is facing up to four years in prison after pleading guilty to delivery of marijuana and maintaining a drug house.

He admitted growing cannabis plants in a building next to his home in Plainfield Township and supplying pounds of the butter to Bernhardt, who is said to have distributed it among the other officers.

While his wife Alyssa Scherzer admitted being aware of the operation and allowing it in her home, she said her involvement was limited to occasionally watering the plants.

She pleaded guilty to maintaining a drug house, which carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison.

Under the Michigan Medical Marijuana Act, patients are allowed to smoke marijuana but those eating cannabis-laced food such as marijuana butter are not protected from prosecution.

Lawyers representing the corrections officers tried but failed to have the case thrown on on the grounds that the questioning of the officers was invalid.

Frederick, Tennant and Bernhardt are charged with charged with delivery and manufacturing of a controlled substance, four-year offenses.

VanDoorne is charged with the two-year offense of maintaining a drug house and the one year offense of possession of marijuana.

Records show Frederick, VanDoorne and Bernhardt are registered medical marijuana patients. While Tennant is not registered his wife is.

They are free on bond and are on unpaid leave from their jobs. All four are said to have rejected plea deals.
