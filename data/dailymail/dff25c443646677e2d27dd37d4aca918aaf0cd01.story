Twitter awoke this morning to the news that Scotland has said no to independence - with celebrities among the first to voice their delight and disappointment.

Piers Morgan led the pack in typical 'witty' style, by tweeting in with 'Och aye, it's the noo!' as counts returned a victory for the 'no' campaign.

He was followed by a host of high profile figures and celebrities - both for and against Scottish independence - including BBC Radio Two Breakfast host Chris Evans, Scottish actor Alan Cumming, and author JK Rowling, who declared her support for the No campaign with a £1 million donation earlier this year.

Voters overwhelmingly rejected Scottish independence by 54 per cent to 46.

Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond took to Twitter as dawn broke, to praise the city of Glasgow, one of the few places to vote in favour of independence, and 'the people of Scotland for such a incredible support'.

David Cameron was not far behind, revealing on Twitter that he has spoken to Better Together leader Alistair Darling 'and congratulated him on an well-fought campaign'.
