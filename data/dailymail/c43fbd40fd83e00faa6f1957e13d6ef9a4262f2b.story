A former NFL player and his wife have revealed all six of their sextuplets died in their arms after a premature birth last month.

Carolina Panther center Steve Justice and his wife Lindsey endured fertility treatment in a bid to have a third child after Lindsey contracted an ovarian disease.

Finally, one year later, the pregnancy test flashed pink - and the doctor said they were expecting seven girls.

He urged them to selectively abort some of them to give the rest a chance of reaching 23 weeks and a strong prospect of survival. But they refused.

However, at 12 weeks, Lindsey miscarried one.

Just 10 weeks later, on September 23, she felt contractions.

All six girls were born in ten minutes and within two hours had died in their parents' arms. 

Now,  the couple has decided to speak out about their horrific ordeal as a sign of support to others who have gone through similar situations, and to show that they will move forward through their trauma.

'We don't have strength right now, we are broken, we are in deep mourning,' Lindsey told NBC.

'We held each one of our six girls and said goodbye to them.

Trauma: Lindsey had already miscarried a seventh fetus at 12 weeks before her waters broke at 21 weeks

'They were all living. They all have birth certificates, they all have a first name a middle name and a last name.'  

The couple, who live in Charlotte, North Carolina, met at Wake Forest college where Lindsey played soccer and Steve played football.

After marrying in 2009, they had two daughters - four-year-old Hannah and two-year-old Hope.

When they tried for a third, they discovered Lindsey had contracted PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome, which vastly reduces the chance of getting pregnant. 

On Steve's birthday, Lindsey handed him a positive pregnancy test, NBC reported.

One trip to the doctor's surgery found there were at least six babies - and later it emerged there was a seventh.

No regrets: Lindsey recounted the birth to NBC but said she does not regret keeping all seven babies

He urged them to abort some. 

'Steve and I didn't even have to look at each other. That was just not going to be an option,' Lindsey said.

They were hit by tragedy in the 12th week when Lindsey miscarried. 

It was not until four weeks later that their doctor revealed yet another surprise: all six remaining babies were girls.

However, as they were still celebrating the news, Lindsey's waters broke.

'I started to feel some contractions and I wanted to not believe that,' she said. 

'What I would give to nurse them, to hold them, to rock them to sleep, to dress them. I want to be their mom, I want them to be here, you know. But that wasn't God's will.'

However, the couple maintain they do not regret their decision to keep all seven.

'I would do the past 21 weeks again and again and again if I had the choice,' Lindsey insists.
