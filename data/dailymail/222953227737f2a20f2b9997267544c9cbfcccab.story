Lillian Baddeley died after being ravaged by four infections she caught at a brand new 'super-hospital' just months after being admitted

A pensioner died after being ravaged by four infections she caught at a brand new 'super-hospital' just months after being admitted, her family say.

Lillian Baddeley, 81, declined from being 'bright as a button' and was dead within eight months of contracting four separate superbugs at University Hospital of North Staffordshire (UHNS).

Her son Martin Bailey, 53, said she was 'systematically attacked' by the chest and stomach infections during her final four stays at the £400 million hospital. 

The grieving family claim the great-grandmother caught E-coli twice, ESBL and Enterobacter on the wards - and are now demanding answers as to why this was allowed to happen. 

Mr Bailey said: 'For her to contract four infections in a few months was terrible.

'They now have a spanking new multi-million pound hospital so it is unforgivable that people can still catch bugs so easily.

'Dad is inconsolable as he can’t understand why she won’t be coming home when she was so full of life not long ago.'

Mrs Baddeley, a retired bakery worker, was first admitted to the hospital two years ago for seizure control after developing epileptic fits.

But during her visit in February she developed E.coli and was kept in for 10 days.

Her subsequent three spells at UHNS each extended to weeks as staff battled the infections.

Mr Bailey said his mother’s last stay ended when she was transferred to Bradwell Community Hospital in the middle of the night where other vulnerable patients were being cared for - despite having an infection.

But two weeks earlier, a consultant had allowed Mrs Baddeley home as her condition was deemed satisfactory.

Mr Bailey, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., added: 'When they transferred her to the Bradwell she was full of infection which put all the other elderly patients with low resilience at great risk.

'It’s a disgrace that was allowed to happen.”

Her son Martin Bailey, 53, said his mother was 'systematically attacked' by the chest and stomach infections during her final four stays at the £400m hospital

Mrs Baddeley, of Talke, Staffs., lost her fight for life at the care home last Thursday.

Grandson-in-law Tim Prescott, 35, added: 'She was good fun but also such a proud and dignified lady for this to happen to.'

Earlier this year an inquest heard that two premature babies died at the hospital because staff on at the hospital did not wash their hands properly.

Jessica Strong was just 11 days old when she died after contracting a bug spread from another child also being treated at the hospital.

A ‘breakdown in hand hygiene’ meant six babies became infected, with Jessica and one other killed as a result.

The hospital admitted that negligence contributed to the deaths of the two babies.

Fiona Howell, Matron for Older Adult Services, said: 'We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the family of Mrs Baddeley.

'Unfortunately, many frail and elderly people are susceptible to infections in the community, which then require treatment in an acute hospital.

“We have met with Mrs Baddeley’s family today and fully reviewed her infection status since December 2012 with them.

'Mrs Baddeley was admitted to the acute Trust to be treated for these infections, which were already present.

'We are continuing to review further concerns that the family have raised today and will be meeting again in the near future.'
