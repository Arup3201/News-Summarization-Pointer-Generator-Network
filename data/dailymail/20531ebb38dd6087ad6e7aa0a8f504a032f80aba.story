Millionaire's wife Kim Maher, 47, has been acquitted of assaulting a pensioner following an appeal

A millionaire's wife who was involved in a brawl in a posh restaurant has been acquitted of assaulting a pensioner following an appeal.

Kim Maher, 47, from Hale, near Altrincham, Cheshire, had a conviction overturned when a key witness failed to appear at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester.

Mrs Maher, who is married to wealthy businessman Vincent Maher, was convicted in October of attacking 65-year-old David Snelson at the upmarket Hale Grill in Altrincham, Cheshire.

Her husband had also been accused of assaulting Mr Snelson but he was cleared when the case was heard at Trafford Magistrates' Court in October.

He was cleared when a key witness, Richard Davies, a chef at the Hale Grill, who was working the night the disturbance took place, told the court that he had not seen Mr Maher involved in the incident.

Mrs Maher, who lives with her husband in an exclusive gated development, where house prices exceed £1million, just outside the village, has now challenged her conviction and was acquitted when Mr Davies failed to show up for the appeal hearing.

The defendant's lawyer, Paul Anthony Lawton, told the court that Mr Davies was able to observe the disturbance in the restaurant through a hatch from the kitchen - and his evidence had called the alleged victim's account into question. Mr Lawton said: ‘The reality is that Mr Davies destroyed the credibility of Mr Snelson.’

He also told the court that Mr Snelson had accused Mrs Maher of grabbing him and spinning him around before her husband attacked him by poking him in the eyes.

But Mrs Maher was acquitted when Mr Davies, who was a witness for both the prosecution and defence, failed to turn up at court.

The prosecution told the court there had been several attempts to contact Mr Davies but that he was no longer working at the Hale Grill or living with his father as he had been at the time. A police officer had spoken to the witness over the phone and told him about yesterday's hearing.

Judge Adrian Smith was reluctant to adjourn the case to wait for the witness who had 'chosen not to come'. Instead, he asked the prosecution to seek advice from the CPS.

Mr Lawton said: ‘I think the whole incident is what the old recorder used to refer to as a brouhaha.’

He said there had clearly been a disturbance in a public place. He explained that Mr and Mrs Maher knew Mr Snelson but there was a suggestion that they had fallen out with him.

Judge Adrian Smith overturned Mrs Maher's conviction and the original punishment of £100 fine, £20 victim surcharge and £300 costs. He instead ordered her to be bound over to keep the peace and refrain from any disorderly behaviour for 12 months.

Judge Smith said that by agreeing to be bound over the defendant accepted a degree of responsibility.

The Mahers live in an exclusive property in a development just outside the village of Hale, near Altrincham.

There are four houses in the enclosure, hidden away behind electric gates on a country road, which are valued at more than £1million each.

A short walk from the village itself, one of the four houses was advertised for on Right Move as a five-bedroom property on sale for £1.575million.

The advertisement said: ‘The property offers spacious and well planned accommodation which extends to over 3200 sq ft. At ground floor there are three reception/living rooms a study/office and a fitted breakfast kitchen.

‘There are five double bedrooms at first floor, three of which have en suite bath/shower rooms and a family bathroom.

The property stands in a generous plot with parking for several vehicles to the front as well as a double garage.

‘To the rear of the house there is a private lawned garden ideal for those with young families.’
