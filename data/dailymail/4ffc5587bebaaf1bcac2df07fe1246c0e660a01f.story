The producer of ITV's damning documentary on Jimmy Savile wrote to the BBC setting out the alleged spree of abuse carried out by the TV personality.

The letter - detailing the allegations made by victims and witnesses which were to be included in the film - was sent to the BBC press office on September 7.

That was three weeks before its 
documentary aired and nearly a month before Newsnight's editor Peter 
Rippon said the BBC's own investigation had uncovered no 
evidence against the corporation.

ITV explored the late DJ's reign of terror in 'Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile'.

Newsnight decided to drop its probe 
into Savile's sordid sex life, with Mr Rippon claiming  on October 2 that he had 'no 
evidence against the BBC'.

The letter from the ITV producer requested a detailed response about who at the BBC knew about the allegations.

But the BBC last night insisted it would not release the correspondence, saying it did not want to undermine the Pollard Review into the broadcaster.

A BBC spokeswoman said: 'It would not be appropriate for the BBC to publish this correspondence as it has been submitted for consideration to the Pollard Review.'

The Mail understands that ITV was happy to unveil the correspondence with its rival broadcaster - but only if the BBC agreed.

Rob Wilson, Conservative MP for Reading East, accused the BBC of a cover-up last night.

He urged the broadcaster to think again, adding: 'It would be outrageous for the BBC to refuse to release these letters.

'ITV has confirmed to me that it would be happy to make them public. Now that the Savile allegations are out in the open, why is the BBC trying to keep the contents of these letters secret?

'There is absolutely no reason why the publication of these letters would harm the two inquiries into the Savile allegations.

'The inquiries must be seen to be independent and transparent, not smokescreens behind which the BBC can hide.'

The revelation comes as former West Yorkshire detective John 
Stainthorpe told ITV Yorkshire Calendar News that Savile was brought in 
for questioning after members of the public contacted the police naming 
the eccentric DJ as a possible killer.

Mr
Stainthorpe, who worked for the West Yorkshire force for more than 40 
years, and who spent years trying to catch Peter Sutcliffe, told the 
programme: 'When the Ripper was really active one of the suspects put 
forward by members of the public was Jimmy Savile, strange as it may 
seem.

'Obviously it was not him, but he was interviewed along with many others, as you can appreciate.'

Today, however, a West Yorkshire Police spokesman 
said: 'Hundreds of people were identified in the operation, we cannot be
more specific than that at this time.

'Details of all who were questioned 
in connection with the crimes are in storage, so we cannot confirm that 
Jimmy Savile was spoken to.'
