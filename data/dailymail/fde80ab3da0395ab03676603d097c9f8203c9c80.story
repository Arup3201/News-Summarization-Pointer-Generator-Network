TV production companies will be offered tax breaks to make children's programmes in the UK under plans being studied by George Osborne.

The Chancellor revealed he is looking 'very seriously' at the idea, which would aim to ensure a new generation of hit shows are British-made, to follow in the oddly-shaped footsteps of the Teletubbies and the Tweenies.

There are fears that other countries are more attractive to make children's programming, seeing British talent move overseas.

The industry argues that tax breaks are needed for children's TV to ensure a new generation of hit shows are British-made, to follow in the oddly-shaped footsteps of the Teletubbies

Mr Osborne used his 2012 Budget to announce a major boost for British drama, unveiling what was quickly dubbed a 'Downton Abbey tax break'.

Homegrown TV productions were given discounts of between 20 and 25 per cent on their corporation tax bill, to encourage more high-end drama to be made in the UK. Now Mr Osborne has revealed he could extend it to children's TV as well.

Speaking at the launch for the Creative Industries Federation, the chancellor said: 'I am looking very seriously to see if I can look to expand tax credits to children's television and also look at it for orchestras.

'It's not the pounds and pence you deliver. What you do is express who we are as a society, as a community and you give voice to the people within those communities . . . all of this is an expression of who we are as human beings,' he added, according to the FT. 'It is a human endeavour in its own right.'

An announcement on new tax breaks for the arts could be announced next week in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement.

It follows a campaign by Pact, the trade association for the UK's independent TV production companies, calling for tax credits offered to film, high-end television and animation to be given to children's TV.

John McVay, Chief Executive at Pact, has said: 'Nowhere in the world does better kids' TV than the UK. Time and time again, British TV producers have created the most successful, innovative and creative programmes for children. 

'From a commercial perspective, it is time that children's TV was recognised in the same echelon of television production as our finest drama.'
