It was once a budget belt in the shadow of glossy Manhattan.

Cash-strapped New Yorkers would bag a flat in Brooklyn and keep it schtum.

But times have changed.

Brooklyn is now 'in vogue', and the price gap between New York's high end and low end is closing, New York Daily News reports.

Manhattan, the other side of Brooklyn Bridge. Once the beacon New Yorkers aspired to. Now Brooklyn is competing

It is the second smallest gap in history.

The median rental in Brooklyn is now just $300 cheaper than its Manhattan counterpart, according to an August 2013 report by Douglas Elliman.

Inching down from last year's $371 gap, experts have branded the drop significant.

HBO series Girls is credited with boosting the district's reputation by market experts.

The series, written by Lena Dunham, glamorises budget living. The characters are based in Brooklyn's Greenpoint, which is now one of the city's most sought-after places to live.

Hot ticket: Brooklyn has soared in popularity. Some rents have increased by 10 per cent in one year

The global hit series Girls follows the lives of four cash-strapped New Yorkers who live in Brooklyn's Greenpoint. The show has been touted as a major factor in the district's new-found popularity

The yearly rate of new rentals has jumped up from 208 last year to 554. It is the highest rate of new rentals in the area since the market crash.

In turn, the median rental price has been pushed up to its highest since records by the brokerage company started more than five years.

Brooklyn properties are getting snapped up quicker and quicker.

A property will now spend an average of 39 days on the market, down from 42 last year.

Letters in Manhattan - home to Broadway, Central Park and the Empire State building - are less eager than the hordes of aspiring Brooklynites.

It takes estate agents 45 days to shift a Manhattan property, nine days longer than last year when they would go in 36.

Although Manhattan's median rental prices continue to press higher, the rate is slower.

Greenpoint renter Joe Ammon, 28, told New York Daily News his rent has jumped up by 4 per cent this year - and neighbours are facing a 10 per cent hike.

On the other side of New York, median rents have increased by just 1.8 per cent.

Queens is poised to become the go-to destination for property-hunters on a budget, Mark Menendez, Douglas Ellimanâ€™s director of rentals, told New York Daily News.
