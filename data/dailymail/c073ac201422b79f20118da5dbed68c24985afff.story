Relive Sportsmail's coverage of the penultimate day of the La Liga season.

Real Madrid's 2-0 defeat to Celta Vigo, courtesy of a brace from frontman Charles meant Carlo Ancelotti's side are now out of the running for the title.

Atletico came from behind to draw with Malaga 1-1 and remain top of the table while Barcelona remain second after a goalless draw away at Elche.

Diego Simeone's side lead the way, three points clear of second-placed Barcelona. However the Catalan giants will win the La Liga title with a win over Atleti at the Nou Camp, courtesy of the head-to-head rule.

Celta Vigo 0-0 Real Madrid

Elche 0-0 Barcelona

Atletico Madrid 0-0 Malaga

Host commentator

Make sure you come back next week as we bring you all the final day action as Barcelona and Atletico go head-to-head for the La Liga title at the Nou Camp on Sunday.

So, after today's results, Atletico Madrid will travel to the Nou Camp to take on Barcelona next Sunday in a game which will see the winner take all!

Atletico currently lead the Catalan giants by three points. However, should Messi and Co beat Diego Simeone's side, the La Liga title will go to Barcelona thanks to the head-to-head rule.

What an epic match that will be!

Real Madrid are OUT of the title race after losing 2-0 to Celta Vigo.

It is now a two-horse race going into the final game of the season!

Atletico fail to score that all important goal and so go into that final game of the season knowing they will be crowned La Liga champions so long as they avoid defeat to Barcelona.

Easier said than done!

Another brilliant save by Willy Caballero denies David Villa who had cut in from the left and launched a ferocious shot at goal only to be denied by the Malaga stopper.

What a match!

Elche fans celebrate wildly after drawing with Barcelona.

Atletico can win the title with a late goal!

Sosa stepped up to take the free-kick which resulted from Angeleri's challenge but curled his effort just wide of the post.

Former Sunderland defender Angeleri brings down Diego just outside the area and receives a second yellow card. Slightly harsh, that one.

Barcelona finally bring Xavi on for Cesc Fabregas.

Rik Sharma: Things get heated as substitute Fabio Coentrao rows with Orellano. The only people Madrid should be angry with are themselves.

Youngster Willian Jose comes on for Casemiro and that's Ancelotti's third sub, so Gareth Bale will remain on the bench. It's all about the Champions League now. 

Fans from all three clubs, put particularly Atleti supporters, listen nervously to see what's going on in their rivals matches.

Should Atletico find a winner with just over tne minutes to go and Barcelona remain goalless then Diego Simeone's men will be crowned La Liga champions with a game to go!

La Liga - As it stands

1. Atletico Madrid 892. Barcelona 863. Real Madrid 84

Peter Jenson: Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino keeps looking at his watch as the players on the bench warm up. Barça need to make a change here with Xavi the possible answer.

Belgium international Alderweireld heads Atletico level with his first-ever La Liga goal!

Signed from Ajax in the summer, the centre back was unmarked and headed home from a corner.

Atletico are back level!

With both Madrid clubs currently losing this is how the La Liga table currently looks...

1. Atletico Madrid 882. Barcelona 863. Real Madrid 84

Arda Turan is replaced by Diego.

Will the Brazilian's magic unlock the Malaga backline?

Atletico go behind as Samuel Garica puts Malaga ahead!

Garcia nips in to dispossesses Miranda before heading home the looping ball past Courtois.

The title race has taken another turn!

Rik Sharma: Another disgraceful goal for Real Madrid to conceed, and that's Charles' second of the game. Xabi Alonso played a suicidal ball back towards Lopez, Charles easily intercepted it and rolled home. 

 

More fresh legs for the home side as Argentine Jose Sosa comes on for Raul Garcia.

Rik Sharma: Real Madrid have come out with much more purpose in the second half.

odric went close and Sergio Ramos nearly made amends but had a header ruled out for offside. 

Atletico goalkeeper Courtois races out of his box to deny Malaga striker Roque Santa Cruz.

Brilliant play the young stopper, former Blackburn and Man City frontman Santa Cruz looked to be clean though on goal and perhaps should have done better.

Koke is replaced by Adrian Lopez.

Atletico frontman Villa receives the ball at the back post and shoots towards goal but Malaga goalkeeper Caballero gets his angles spot on to tip the effort over for an Atletico corner which, after a brief scramble, Malaga clear.

Eliseu receives a yellow card for time-wasting after taking an age to take a throw-in with 39 minutes still to play.

Malaga, five points above the drop, are themselves desperate for the points as they bid to climb away from the relegation zone.

Atletico goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, celebrating his 22nd birthday today, has had nothing to do so far in this game.

However, it remains 0-0.

We're back underway for the second period.

As it stands...

1. Atletico Madrid 892. Barcelona 863. Real Madrid 84

Real are currently OUT of the title race as they trail 1-0 to Celta Vigo.

Meanwhile Atletico and Barcelona remain goalless against Malaga and Elche, respectively.

 

Real HAVE to win tonight to stand any chance of catching their local rivals but are behind against Celta Vigo.

1. Atletico Madrid 892. Barcelona 863. Real Madrid 84

 

Rik Sharma: Real Madrid have been pathetic so far and that goal sums up their display.

Sergio Ramos was wandering on the edge of his own box and was robbed by Charles, who rounded Diego Lopez and smashed home with aplomb.

 

Raul Garcia leaps highest to get his head to the ball in the opposition area but can only direct the ball wide.

Atletico are really pushing for an opener but perhaps nerves are getting to them a little...

Koke gets on the end of Juanfran's cross from the right but drags his effort wide.

 

Rik Sharma: The closest we've come so far is a header from Charles after 30 minutes, getting on the end of a scooped ball into the box but nodding over the crossbar. 

Arda Turan is correctly yellow carded for going down far too easily in the box.

The Turkish midfielder went down theatrically depsite the fact Malaga's Ignacio Camacho didn't appear to touch him.

No place for that in football.  That was scandalous!

With no goals to report on so far the top of La Liga currently looks like this...

1. Atletico Madrid 892. Barcelona 863. Real Madrid 85

Messi dribbles past the Elche defence and fires a shot at goal but his effort is deflected and goes out for a corner which comes to nothing.

Rik Sharma: Still a soporific affair at Balaídos and Celta Vigo have shaded the game.

Alvaro Morata looking a little lost up front for Real Madrid, with usual hitman Karim Benzema absent through injury.

 

Pinto, Dani Alves, Adriano, Busquets, Bartra, Mascherano, Fabregas, Iniesta, Messi, Sanchez, Pedro.

Courtois, Juanfran, Filipe Luis, Tiago, Miranda, Alderweireld, Koke, Gabi, Villa, Raul Garcia,Turan.

Rik Sharma: Real Madrid have all but given up on La Liga, playing a heavily rotated side against Celta Vigo today. Sami Khedira plays his first game for six months, returning after injury.

Real Madrid: Diego López, Ramos, Khedira, Marcelo, Alonso, Casemiro, Arbeloa, Nacho, Modric, Morata, Isco.

We're ten minutes in and all three games remain goalless.
