A row of curvaceous figures sit stiffly on a bench, each one with a perfectly made up face and dressed in a clinging fishnet bodystocking.

But these eerily pneumatic 'women' are in fact realistic dolls, designed, moulded and painted to fulfill the every desire of customers around Europe.

And making the  5,500 euro (£4,000) dolls, which weigh just 40kg, is just all in a day's work for three people at the  Dreamdoll workshop, in Duppigheim, northern France.

Each doll is handmade, takes a week to make and has make-up painstakingly painted on by hand

Owner Thierry Reverdi and employees Eric and Raphaela take light-weight aluminium 'skeletons' and painstakingly add 'flesh', eyes, features, hair and clothes to bring the dolls as close to life as their customers want.

The Dreamdolls website describes their products as 'a range of realistic dolls of a quality and an exceptional beauty'.

But it declares that although 'planned for sexual use' the 'lovedolls' are 'also used as realistic mannequins for photo studios for the catalogues of lingerie'. 

The company also insists that many of their customers are collectors who see the plastic models as works of art.

Each custom-made doll which makes up the more expensive US Edition range takes them a week to make, from pouring the stain-proof and non-stick silicone into moulds to painting on layers of make-up.

Once the figure is released from the mould, Eric checks the mannequin for imperfections and flexibility before the human details are added.

Raphaela pops the glass eyes into the sockets, and glues the separately moulded silicone ears to the side of the mannequin's head.

She also has the job of hand-painting the dolls' faces, adding glossy red or plum-coloured lipstick, creating come-hither smoky eyes and adding polish to its nails.

The US Edition consists of four models: Angela (long blonde hair and blue eyes), Désirée (long black  hair and blue eyes), Ginger (short red  hair and green eyes) and Scarlet (long brown hair and green eyes).

Each one is just over five feet tall, and breast size and skin colour can be changed to suit the customer.

All the moulded silicone ears are placed in a box, to be glued to the mannequins' heads

The dolls also come with an internal heating system - which the company points out must be turned off before washing.

Other models can be varied, with a range of skin, eye colour and cup sizes ranging from a C to an EE breast size.

The company's owner Thierry Reverdi will even add the finishing touches, brushing the synthetic hair, or adjusting the dream dolls' outfits.

Then dressed, wrapped in clear plastic and bubble wrap, they're arranged sitting upright on a stool inside a specially-built case and shipped out to customers.
