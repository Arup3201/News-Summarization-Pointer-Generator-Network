Leaning casually on the table with a cigarette in one hand as he watches his country’s satellite soar into space, Kim Jong Un’s pose is oddly familiar.

Worryingly familiar, in fact – for it lends him a distinct resemblance to  Dr No, the original Bond villain.North Korea’s rocket launch on Wednesday earned Kim virtual global condemnation, alienating even long-standing allies such as China and Russia, while reports in the US suggested that the spacecraft might be ‘tumbling out of control’.

One official described an earlier Korean rocket design as ‘a dishwasher wrapped in tin foil’. But at home, the 28-year-old dictator’s gamble was being hailed as a major triumph, with tens of thousands staging a mass rally in the capital, Pyongyang, as a tribute.

Relieved: Kim Jong Un smokes a cigarette at the General Satellite Control and Command Centre after the launch of the Unha-3 (Milky Way 3) rocket carrying the second version of Kwangmyongsong-3 satellite

North Korean authorities insist they  simply put a weather satellite into space.

But much of the rest of the world sees it as a thinly disguised test of banned long-range missile technology.

 Sean Connery’s 007 takes on Dr Julius No, who is plotting to disrupt a 
US space launch with an atomic beam.

Naturally, Bond foils the plan – pushing the evil scientist to his death in the reactor’s cooling vat.

The photo was released as thousands 
of people took to the streets of the country's capital of Pyongyang to 
participate in a mass rally today.

Meanwhile in South Korea, the rocket debris was recovered by the navy with inspectors analysing it to ascertain the rocket's techological capabilities.

The launch came only eight months after a very public 
rocket launch failure and less than a year on the job, the decision to go ahead was a big gamble for0 North Korea's 
young leader.

It paid off, at least in the short term, projecting Kim Jong Un to his people as powerful, capable and determined.

On
 the other hand it will increase his country's international isolation 
and could strengthen the hands of the only entity that poses a threat to
 his rule: the military.

North Koreans gathered en masse in a staged demonstration, partly to glorify Kim and partly to celebrate the launch of the rocket, which Pyongyang says put a crop and weather monitoring satellite into orbit. The rest of the world saw it as a thinly-disguised test of banned long-range missile technology.

The launch's success, 14 years after North Korea's first attempt, shows more than a little of the gambling spirit in the third Kim to rule North Korea since it became a country in 1948. 

'North Korean officials will long be touting Kim Jong Un as a gutsy leader who commanded the rocket launch despite being new to the job and young', said Kim Byung-ro, a North Korea specialist at Seoul National University in South Korea.

Sea of support: Hundreds of thousands of North Koreans rallied today in the freezing cold to revel in the country's successful rocket launch as South Korea voiced concern that its rival could follow up with a third nuclear test

Fired up: Left, North Korea's Unha-3 rocket lifts off from the Sohae launch pad in Tongchang-ri, North Korea; right, he retrieved debris from the first stage of the rocket on the deck of a South Korean milliary vessel at a naval base in Pyeongtaek, about 70 kilometers south of Seoul

North Korean state media said Kim himself issued the order to fire the rocket on Wednesday despite the prospect of another failure and condemnation from abroad.

Kim was praised for boldly carrying out his father and former leader Kim Jong Il's last wish before his  death in December last year.

Kim Jong Il had made development of missiles and nuclear weapons a priority despite international opposition and his nation's crushing poverty.

His son's success is likely to help him consolidate his power over a government crammed with elderly, old-school lieutenants of his father and grandfather, foreign analysts said.

But what is unclear is whether Kim will continue to smoothly solidify power, steering clear of friction with the powerful military while dealing with the strong possibility of more crushing sanctions against a country with what the United Nations calls a serious hunger problem.

'Certainly in the short run, this is an enormous boost to his prestige,' said Marcus Noland, a North Korea analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.

Noland, however, also mentioned the 
'Machievellian argument' that this could cause future problems for Kim 
by significantly boosting the power of the military - 'the only real 
threat to his rule.'

There 
is also the question whether Kim, after thumbing his nose at the world 
by firing the rocket, will continue to ignore the universal wisdom that 
'North Korea's only hope for escaping economic implosion is for the 
country to open up economically,' said Robert Hathaway, Asia director at
 the Wilson Center think tank in Washington.

As
 a cold wave lifted, tens of thousands of people gathered at the snowy 
Kim Il Sung Square on Friday, some dancing in the plaza before the rally
 began, continuing beer-filled street celebrations that had started on 
Wednesday.

Top officials told the people the critics abroad were characterizing the launch as a missile test. Denying the claims, they urged North Koreans to stand defiant in the face of outside condemnation.

Pyeongtaek, South Korea

Interesting cargo: The debris is believed to be a fuel container from the first stage of the rocket. Defence officials said South Korea has no plans to return the shell to North Korea because the launch violated U.N. council resolutions

Vital statistics: This photo has been annotated and released by the South Korean Defence Ministry via Yonhap. It shows the dimensions of the debris for the rocket, perched on a ship off the port of Gunsan

Missile madness: As the U.S. led international condemnation of what it calls a covert test of missile technology, top North Korean officials denied the allegations and maintained the country's right to develop its space program

Despite the success, experts say North
 Korea is years from even having a shot at developing reliable missiles 
that could bombard the American mainland and other distant targets.

A
 missile program is built on decades of systematic, intricate testing, 
something extremely difficult for economically struggling Pyongyang, 
which faces guaranteed sanctions and world disapproval each time it 
stages an expensive launch.

North
 Korea will need larger and more dependable missiles, and more advanced 
nuclear weapons, to threaten U.S. shores, though it already poses a 
shorter-range missile threat to its neighbors.

Successfully firing a rocket, however, was so politically crucial for Kim at the onset of his rule that he allowed the April launch to go through even though it resulted in the collapse of a nascent food-aid-for-nuclear-freeze deal with the United States, North Korea analyst Kim Yeon-su of Korea National Defence University in Seoul said.

The launch success 'consolidates his image as true successor of his father's songun (military-first) leadership, but it will also deepen his country's economic isolation because sanctions will get tougher.

'That will hurt his image as an economically savvy leader and undermine his legitimacy for the next two to three years,' Kim said.

The next big question is how the 
outside world will react. U.N. Security Council condemnation has already
 come; more sanctions may follow, both from the U.N. and individual 
countries.

Scott Snyder, a 
Koreas specialist for the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote recently 
that the launch and North Korea's nuclear ambitions should inspire 
cooperation between the often wary U.S. and China, and South Korea and 
Japan.

If there is a 
common threat that should galvanize regional cooperation 'it most 
certainly should be the prospect of a 30-year-old leader of a terrorized
 population with his finger on a nuclear trigger,' Snyder said.

How advanced? The Korean letters inscribed on the debris read 'Un Ha'.  The debris, believed to be a fuel tank, will be analysed to determine its level of ballistic expertise, the defence ministry said
