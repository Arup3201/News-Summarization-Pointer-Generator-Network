England bowlers Jamie-Lea Winch and Natalie Melmore suffered a 20-17 defeat in the women's pairs final against South Africa.

England were 16-11 ahead but had to force the game into an extra end and South Africa Tracy-Lee Botha and Colleen Piketh took gold.

Northern Ireland pair Mandy Cunningham and Barbara Cameron won bronze with a 15-14 win over Jersey's Katie Nixon and Lindsey Greechan.

The English pair were 7-1 down but won nine consecutive points and then won six on the trot after falling behind again.

Melmore drove home the final bowl against the jack to save the game but a similar shot failed to find its target at the close of the extra end.

The 25-year-old Devon bowler, whose younger partner was in tears at the end, said: "It obviously just wasn't meant to be. We missed it by the smallest of margins. If I had got the jack in the ditch I think that would have been game over.

'It was a great game, we have played well together all this tournament. It;'s the first time we have played at this level together. We are young, we enjoyed it and we are going to come back for more.'

Northern Ireland's medal was only their third so far of the Games, although they are guaranteed nine more in the boxing, and their win in a close match prevented Jersey claiming their first medal in any sport since 1990.

And for Cameron, it was her first medal in five Games.

The 52-year-old Ballymena bowler said: 'I've been close to this position on a few occasions but this is it now. It's brilliant, I can't really explain how it feels, it's unbelievable.

'It's a dream come true. You never give up on your dreams.'

Cunningham added: 'I'm still in shock. I'm absolutely delighted for Barbara. She has said she is bowing out but I think we might try to talk her round.'

When asked how she would be celebrating, the Belfast 50-year-old said: 'Drunk, hopefully. I don't have to get up in the morning so I'm going to enjoy lying in bed with a hangover."'

England have a second chance of gold on the final day of the bowls when they have a men's fours showdown with Scotland, who are also in action in the evening session when Darren Burnett takes on Canada's Ryan Bester in the singles final.
