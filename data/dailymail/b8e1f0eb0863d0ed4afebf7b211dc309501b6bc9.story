Everton skipper Phil Jagielka has recovered from his World Cup hangover and aiming to continue his impressive run of clean sheets against Burnley on Sunday.

Jagielka, 32, hasn't conceded in four matches for club and country following an impressive Europa League draw in Lille on Thursday night and another at Turf Moor will make it five-in-a-row for the first time since the end of the 2012/13 season.

It's not a bad comeback for a player blamed for England's costly defeats against Italy and Uruguay in the summer.

And he's also added goals to his game, scoring against San Marino, Liverpool and Aston Villa this season.

'Keeping clean sheets is what my game is all about. If I can pop up with the occasinal goal, all the better, but as a defender my end of the bargain is to keep the ball out,' he said.

'There have been times this season at Everton where we didn't even look like keeping one clean sheet, never mind two in a row. Now we've got two decent results from difficult games, it gives the boys up front more to go on.

'People were quick to point out how bad my loss of form was at the start of the season, but I knew it wasn't as bad as had been made out.

'Then I score a couple of goals and I become a better player all of a sudden. That's the way football is.

'I feel for the majority of the season I can look myself in the mirror and the game against Lille was one of those.'

Since a 2-1 defeat at Manchester United on October 5, Jagielka has played for England against San Marino and Estonia, and for his club side against Aston Villa and Lille, and hasn't seen Joe Hart or Tim Howard have to pick the ball out of the net.

His club manager Roberto Martinez has hailed his recent displays as 'immense' particularly as he's had to play with a number of different partners at the back; John Stones, Antolin Alcaraz and Sylvain Distin at Everton, and Gary Cahill for his country. 

Talking about Everton, he said: 'It has been difficult when you've not go much continuity because of the amount of games and injuries that we've had.

'But fair play to the boys, Hibbo (Tony Hibbert) came in against Lille. Obviously I have played together a lot with Sylvain so it was nice to keep a clean sheet with our first appearance together in a while.'

What made it even more satisfying to Everton fans was that their skipper snuffed out £10million Lille striker Divock Origi, who is on loan there from Liverpool. 'He looked like a threat but I thought we dealt with him,' he said.

Everton climbed away from the lower regions of the table with a comprehensive 3-0 win against Aston Villa last weekend.

It was only their second Premier League victory of the season and they will expect to use it as a springboard against opponents Burnley who are still seeking their first win.
