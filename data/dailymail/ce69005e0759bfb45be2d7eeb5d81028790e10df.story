Dangerous: QC Robert Francis, who last week delivered a report on the scandal at Mid Staffordshire hospitals, said healthcare assistants have only 'a few hours training' before being ¿let loose¿ on patients

Hospital staff caring for the most vulnerable patients have less training for their job and face fewer checks than bouncers or minicab drivers, an expert warned yesterday.

Robert Francis said healthcare assistants have only ‘a few hours training’ before being ‘let loose’ on patients.

The QC warned there was nothing to stop a worker found totally unfit at one hospital being employed by another.

Last week Mr Francis delivered a damning report into the scandal at Mid Staffordshire hospitals, where hundreds died because of poor care.

But he warned that failings in the NHS meant the disaster could well be repeated in other hospitals.

He urged the Health Service to make a number of key changes to improve care and ensure hospitals and staff are rigorously checked.

They included making healthcare assistants undergo basic training before allowing them on wards.

There are around 300,000 of these staff – also known as healthcare support workers – in the NHS.

They are mainly responsible for basic care, including feeding, washing and dressing patients, yet most have no medical qualifications or training. And, because they are not regulated by a watchdog, they cannot be barred from working even if found guilty of appalling lapses.

Mr Francis said: ‘Someone who is allowed to provide direct physical care for any patient, let alone highly vulnerable people who cannot speak for themselves, should be the subject of at least some record.

‘It seems strange to me that there is more regulation for nightclub doormen and minicab drivers than healthcare support workers. A healthcare assistant who is found totally unfit at one hospital can walk down the road and get a job at another, and nobody needs to know about what happens in the other place.’

Giving evidence to MPs at the health select committee, he added: ‘The amount of training before they are let loose on patients can be as little as a few hours. I was concerned to find there seemed to be no consistency at all for this grade of work.

‘They should have to have some record of who they are, how you can get hold of them, where they are employed and if they no longer work there then why not. Everyone talks about basic care as if it is something very easy. We need some training standards. They don’t need to be very complicated but we do need to test people’s aptitude.’

The Royal College of Nursing has repeatedly warned the lack of training for healthcare support workers is putting patients at risk.

Repeat warning: Mr Francis warned that failings in the NHS meant the Mid Staffordshire disaster could well be repeated in other hospitals

Last month its general secretary Dr Peter Carter said most of these workers were just picking it up as they went along.

He said: ‘If you walk into a ward for older people, this is where you find most of the problems, most of the staff nowadays are not nurses; they are healthcare assistants.

‘There’s nothing wrong with healthcare assistants providing they have had a proper training and education, but in far too many cases they’ve not had as much as an hour of training.

‘Who can understand a situation where you employ someone, put a uniform on them so they look like a nurse, put them on to a ward or in a care home, and the mindset is: “You pick it up as you go along”?’

Healthcare assistants wear similar tunics to nurses and can be distinguished only by the title on their name badges. Some earn just £7 an hour – less than a cleaner

Bouncers have to undergo training and sit an exam before they can gain the licence that allows them to work.

They must prove they can  confiscate drugs, cope with a medical emergency and deal with drunken revellers.

Minicab drivers must hold a clean driving licence and have to sit a 40-minute written test set by their local council. They must also go to a GP for a medical.
