TV pitchman Don Lapre died from a self-inflicted razor blade wound to the neck, according to new reports.

The U.S. Marshals Service confirmed Lapre, the self-proclaimed 'King of Infomercials,' was found dead in an apparent suicide while in federal custody on Sunday - days before he was due to stand trial for massive fraud.

Sources tell TMZ.com piles of 
blood-soaked clothing were found in Lapre's Arizona jail cell. Officials
believe Lapre used the clothes to conceal his wound and prevent guards 
from attempting to save his life, according to the website.

Tragic: Don Lapre, 47, was found dead in his Arizona jail cell on Sunday

The autopsy was completed yesterday.

Lapre's mother claimed yesterday prison official's had taken her son's anti-depressant medication away.

Shirley Cleveland said her 
47-year-old son, who was found dead in his prison cell in Florence, 
Arizona, was being treated for severe depression before he 
was arrested for allegedly defrauding 220,000 people of $52million.

Lapre had attempted suicide in the past, Ms Cleveland told TMZ.

When she learned prison guards in 
Florence, Arizona, had taken his medication away she called his lawyer 
and pleaded for her to intervene, Ms Cleveland told the site.

Lapre's mother said the jail gave him another medicine, but it did not treat his depression.

TMZ also reported that Ms Cleveland insisted her son, a father of two, was innocent of all charges.

Lapre
was awaiting a trial after being indicted on 41 charges stemming from a
nationwide scheme to sell what was billed as 'The Greatest Vitamin in 
the World.'

Federal 
prosecutors alleged that 226,794 people were promised lucrative 
commission checks for selling vitamins and recruiting others to the 
business, but said it was a worthless venture for most who signed up.

The federal grand jury indictment, made public in June, revealed that that the internet-based businesses had lost investors an estimated $51.8million.

The U.S. Marshals Service confirmed he
died in an apparent suicide while in federal custody but the death 
remains under investigation.

However there was a 'large amount of 
blood' in the cell where he was found and so it appears he cut himself, 
law enforcement sources told TMZ.

A grand jury had indicted him on counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud and promotional money laundering.

When Lapre failed to arrive for his 
arraignment that month a warrant was issued for his arrest and he was discovered less than 24 hours later.

Authorities
found him in a gym with a cut in his groin and they believed at the 
time he had attempted suicide by trying to slice his femoral artery.

Last week, Lapre's attorney filed a 
motion at U.S. District Court in Phoenix seeking to get him released 
from jail pending his trial, scheduled for next year, the Arizona 
Republic reported.

The 
motion said that Lapre was no longer a flight risk and would have access
to a psychologist to monitor his medication and mental status.

'I
can't tell you what his state of mind was,' Patricia Gitre, Lapre's 
attorney, told the Arizona Republic 'It was a difficult time for him, 
obviously.'

The charges carried potential fines of
between $250,000 and $500,000 per count and federal prison terms of 
between five and 25 years.

The company said it would support the
hundreds of thousands of people it recruited to start up online 
businesses selling vitamins.

But investors were allegedly misled as the company tried to get them to purchase additional advertising and other services.

Lapre was known for his emphatic 
salesman style but the company was shut down in 2007 after customers 
filed hundreds of complaints.

Meanwhile he was personally paid more than $2.2million from the business between 2004 and 2007, the indictment said.

Lapre was known for his television appearances on shows such as 'Making Money From A Tiny One Bedroom Apartment'.

The pitchman, who referred to himself 
on his website as 'The King of Infomercials', would recount his 
hard-luck life story to viewers.

He encouraged them to turn their lives
around like he had and is notorious for claiming he made $50,000 a week
from his one bedroom apartment.

It was widely parodied - notably by David Spade on Saturday Night Live.

In a rambling note on his website, Lapre said he did nothing wrong.

'I did not have the perfect company, but never once did I allow one thing to be done that would violate any law,' he wrote on donlapre.com.

'Nevertheless, because the majority of people did not make money ... I am left to fight a battle that will for sure destroy what energy I have left inside.'
