A pensioner branded a neighbour from hell has been warned that she must keep the peace for six months or face a fine after destroying a homeowner's flower bed - in an apparent row over a squirrel.

Marion Webster, 78, has been reported to police at least 40 times by long-suffering neighbours for her anti-social behaviour.

She was found guilty of criminal damage last October for tearing out £50 of flowers from a neighbour's flower beds at Solihull Magistrates Court.

'Neighbour from hell': Marion Webster has been warned by magistrates to keep the peace for six months after she was found guilty of criminal damage after ripping up a homeowner's flowerbeds

And yesterday she was ordered by magistrates to keep the peace for six months and warned she would be fined £50 if she continued to torment her neighbours.

Neighbours say that the attack on the flowers came after Miss Webster became convinced that a resident had trained a squirrel to enter her garden.

Kaya Ball, prosecuting, said police had been called to the pensioner's home numerous times over the past decade. 

She said: 'This isn't just an isolated incident of cutting some flowers.

'On the face of it, it seems trivial, but when it is presented as part of a long-standing neighbour dispute you can see there are several incidents.'

But Sam Christopher, defending, said she was an elderly lady of 'previous good character.'

Following sentencing, neighbours today branded Webster 'a neighbour from hell' and expressed anger at her lenient sentence.

Row: Neighbours say that Miss Webster attacked a neighbour's flowers after a row over a squirrel that had been coming into her garden

One said: 'The last thing you expect to have when you move into a nice quiet neighbourhood like this one is an elderly woman acting like a yob.

'She is very proud of her garden and she got it into her head that someone had it in for her and was jealous of her flowers.

'She put up a big metal gate, extended the height of her fences and made the place into a fortress.

'Then she became convinced a resident had trained a squirrel to enter her garden after dark and tear up her flowers but everyone thought it was a joke.

'One night she cut someone's flowers up and tore up plants from the roots.'

Another reported her to police for playing loud classical music at 3am.

One claimed: 'She seems to enjoy causing a fuss and making everyone's life hell.'

West Midlands Police confirmed they had been contacted more than 40 times since 2002 about alleged incidents including claims from Webster herself that she was a victim of flower vandals.

A spokeswoman said: 'The force has been working in partnership with a vulnerable persons officer, social services and Solihull Community Housing to engage with everybody concerned and to resolve the problems in the area.

'There have been no complaints since October 2012.'
