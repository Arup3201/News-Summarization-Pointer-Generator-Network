Too young: 12-year-old Tamir E Rice was shot dead Saturday after police confused his airsoft gun with a real firearm 

The boy who was shot dead by Cleveland, Ohio police yesterday, when they mistook his toy gun for a real firearm, has been identified as 12-year-old Tamir E Rice.

The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's Office released the victim's name Sunday afternoon, as the boy's family hired attorney Tim Kucharski to represent them in the upcoming investigation.

Kucharski, of the law firm Richardson & Kucharski told WKYC: 'Apparently, listening to the 911 call...the caller halfway across the part recognized that this was a toy gun. I'm not sure how police weren't able to make that same decision.'

'We're going to conduct our own parallel investigation. I understand what police are putting out there, I cannot confirm or deny those facts. The family is absolutely is devastated. He was a wonderful young man. Our own investigation will begin as early as tomorrow.' 

A concerned man, who was saw the boy at a playground next to a recreation center Saturday afternoon, called 911 around 3:30pm and told the dispatcher: 'I’m sitting in the park…there’s a guy in collman1

here with a pistol, and it’s probably a fake one, but he’s pointing it at everybody.

'The guy keeps pulling it in and out…it’s probably fake, but he’s scaring the s*** out of people.' 

Minutes later, two Cleveland Police officers - a rookie and a 10-15 year veteran - arrived at the scene, where they apparently saw Tamir pick up the gun from a table and put it in his waistband.

The rookie then asked the boy to put his hands up, at which point the youngster reached into his waistband and pulled out the pistol,  Police Patrolmen's Association President Jeffrey Follmer said.

Scene: Tamir was spotted 'waving around' the airsoft gun in the playground area next to Cuddell Recreation Center (pictured) at around 3:30pm on Saturday. Above, police are pictured at the scene

Despite the 911 caller's prior warning that the gun was likely fake, the officer then fired two shots at the boy, at least one of which hit him in the stomach, according to Cleveland.com. 

After the shooting he was taken to MetroHealth Medical Center in serious condition, but his condition deteriorated throughout the night and he died early Sunday. 

Police later told Fox 8 the weapon the boy was carrying was 'an airsoft type replica gun resembling a semi-automatic pistol.' They added that the gun's orange safety indicator had been removed.

Union officials claimed the officers - one of whom was later taken to hospital with an ankle injury - acted responsibly amid concerns the boy was in possession of a real gun.

However, Deputy Chief of Field Operations Ed Tomba described the incident as 'very, very tragic', saying that the child did not threaten the officer verbally or physically.

'When an officer gives a command, we expect it to be followed,' Mr Tomba said. 'The way it looks like right now, it wasn't followed, but we're going to continue our investigation.'

On Saturday evening, members of the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office were at the scene. Investigators will determine if the officer was justified in shooting the boy. 

Response: Two Cleveland Police officers arrived at the scene following the 911 call. After the boy refused to put his hands up and reached for the gun (pictured from another perspective), one officer fired at him twice

According to the boy's mother, Samaria Rice, the family lives across the street from the recreation center, which is expected to remain cordoned off on Sunday.

She told Action News 19 the first she heard of the shooting was when two  men came to her home to say her son had been shot. She added that her son did not have access to a gun at the property.

Both officers involved are believed to have been placed on administrative leave in accordance with protocol in officer-involved shooting incidents. An investigation is ongoing.
