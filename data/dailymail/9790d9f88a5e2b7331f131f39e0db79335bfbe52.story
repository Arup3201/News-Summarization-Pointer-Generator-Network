Former Chelsea striker Demba Ba asked for the sprinklers to be turned on as he made his Besiktas debut in the unlikely surroundings of Macclesfield's Moss Rose stadium on Wednesday night.

Ba, who cost the Turkish giants £5million, was given a rousing reception on the Conference ground as he played the second 45 minutes of a 1-1 draw against Bundesliga side Mainz 05.

It was vital preparation for the 29-year-old Senegal star ahead of next week's key Champions League clash against Feyenoord and he made a point of telling the Macclesfield's ground staff to give the turf an extra watering before he made his entrance.

Debut Demba: Ba showed some neat touches during his 45 minutes on the pitch against Mainz 05

Initially, Ba looked understandably 
rusty after an inactive summer but improved as the match wore on and 
made a couple of good runs in front of his new manager, ex-West Ham and 
Everton player Slaven Bilic.

A
 small but noisy contingent of Turkish fans chanted his name and the 
red-booted Ba made a point of running over to acknowledge them at the 
final whistle. 

The match 
at Moss Rose with its capacity of just 6,355 represented a dramatic 
change of scene for the No 9 whose goal for Chelsea against Liverpool at 
Anfield last season effectively handed the Premier League title 
advantage to Manchester City.

His
 first appearance for Besiktas in front of a few hundred fans was the 
latest example of famous football players and managers making low-key 
debuts.

The first £1million
 footballer Trevor Francis was ordered by his Nottingham Forest manager 
Brian Clough to make his debut for the ‘A’ team against Notts County in 
the Midland Intermediate League.

David
 Beckham’s Manchester United career started with a subsitute’s 
appearance in a League Cup tie at Brighton while David Moyes’ ill-fated 
reign as United  manager last year began inauspiciously with a 1-0 
defeat against the Singha All-Stars in Bangkok, Thailand.

Ironically, last night's match was organised by a company run by agent Kenny Moyes - David's brother.

Mainz took the lead through Daniel Brosinski after 52 minutes with Atiba Hutchinson levelling after 78 minutes.

Besiktas
 will now face Feyenoord on Rotterdam in their Champions Leagie third 
qualifying round first leg and their hopes will rest on Ba.

He
 scored 87 goals in three years at West Ham, Newcastle United and 
Chelsea but was deemed surplus to requirements by Chelsea manager Jose 
Mourinho following his purchase of £32million Atletico Madrid striker 
Diego Costa.
