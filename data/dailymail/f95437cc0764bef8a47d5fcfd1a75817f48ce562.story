Robert Lewandowski has revealed he regrets picking Cristiano Ronaldo ahead of Bayern Munich team-mate Manuel Neuer in the 2014 Ballon d'Or vote.

The Poland captain decided to choose Ronaldo as the worthy candidate to win the prestigious award ahead of Manuel Neuer and Bastian Schweinsteiger in second and third respectively.

However Lewandowski, who finalised his vote in the summer, said said he would change his mind if he was given the choice again.

The Bayern Munich striker, speaking to German newspaper Welt, said: 'Voting for Ronaldo instead of Neuer was a mistake.

'I would clearly vote for Neuer now if I had the chance. But I already cast my vote back in August or something. I would vote different now.

'I am sorry for Manu. I am really surprised that he did not even come in second and the big gap to Ronaldo also baffles me. Manuel is an amazing goalkeeper and person.'
