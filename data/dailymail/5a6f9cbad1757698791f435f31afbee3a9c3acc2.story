West Ham will express concerns to their players ahead of next year's Africa Cup of Nations due to the Ebola crisis.

Alex Song (Cameroon), Diafra Sakho (Senegal) and Cheikhou Kouyate (Senegal) are in contention to play in the tournament, which has been thrown into turmoil because of the outbreak.

And Hammers officials will hold talks with the trio ahead of the tournament, which is due to start on January 17.

There are obvious fears from within Upton Park about allowing their players to participate in the competition due to the virus.

The club are keeping close tabs on the World Health Organisation's guidelines on the epidemic and will use the information as part of discussions with players.

Though, ultimately, the club will let the threesome decide whether they choose to play in the tournament at the start of next year.

Morocco this week pulled out of hosting the tournament because of the crisis - and the Confederation of African Football (CAF) is yet to find a new host.

Angola had been touted as a possibility, but they have since ruled themselves out of the running.

Clubs' stances on player participation for the tournament is likely to depend on which country replaces Morocco.

West Ham's fears comes after Borussia Dortmund took the decision to pull striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang out of Gabon's clash against Lesotho on Thursday night.

Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc said: 'Without falling into hysteria, there are certain warnings from the medical side. We also have a duty of care to our squad.'

Likewise, Nigeria captain Victor Enyeama said his club side Lille make him undergo strenuous tests when ever he returns from international duty.

'My club monitors me for three weeks any time I return from Nigeria because of Ebola and nobody wants to sit around you or shake (your hand) then,' said Enyeama.

'If I were CAF, I will suspend the tournament because it is difficult to contain. But if we qualified, I will play in the tournament.'
