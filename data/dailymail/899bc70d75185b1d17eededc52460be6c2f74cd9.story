U.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan has performed her first same-sex wedding, it was today revealed. 

The 54-year-old justice presided over the wedding of former law clerk Mitchell Reich and his partner Patrick Pearsall in the Washington suburb of Chevy Chase, Maryland, yesterday.

It was the first ceremony for a gay or lesbian couple at which Kagan officiated, Supreme Court spokesman Kathy Arberg confirmed.

But she is not the first ever Supreme Court to have done so - with retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg both having previously performed same-sex weddings.

Ginsburg most recently officiated at the wedding of Washington theater director Molly Smith, who married her longtime partner, Suzanne Blue Star Boy, on September 14.

The couple, who met in Alaska, reportedly wed in a ceremony in Arena's Kogod Cradle in front of around 180 guests, including actress Erin Davie and performer Nicholas Rodriguez. 

Earlier this month, the Supreme Court formally added gay marriage cases to the justices' agenda for their closed-door conference on September 29.

The action does not mean that the court will decide that day to hear state appeals of lower court rulings that struck down bans on same-sex marriage. 

However, it will be the first time the justices have the issue before them.

Appeals have been filed from Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin, while the gay couples who won in each case in the lower courts also favor Supreme Court review.

The justices could put off deciding whether same-sex couples nationwide have the right to marry under the Constitution until January and still be able to issue a decision by late June.

Last week, Justice Ginsburg dropped some hints about the Supreme Court's plan of action on the issue of gay marriage.

She said people should pay close attention to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as an indicator for when the Supreme Court will address marriage equality.

Speaking at the University of Minnesota Law School, she said 'there will be some urgency' if that appeals court allows same-sex marriage bans to stand.

Such a decision would run contrary to a legal trend favoring gay marriage and force the Supreme Court to step in sooner, she predicted.

But she added that if the appeals panel falls in line with other rulings, there will be 'no need for us to rush.'

In America, same-sex marriage is legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia.
