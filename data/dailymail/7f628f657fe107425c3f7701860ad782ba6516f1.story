Toyota is recalling 2.27million vehicles worldwide over fears a faulty airbag inflator could explode.

The company said it was notifying owners of vehicles involved in a 2013 safety recall, including 766,300 in the U.S., to replace airbag inflators.

Previously, it asked dealers to inspect the airbags and only replaced those judged to be faulty.

The recall involves about 20 Toyota 
models, including some Corolla compacts and Tundra pickups made in 
2003-2004 and some 2002-2004 Lexus SC 430 coupes.

Toyota is asking 766,000 U.S. owners affected by last year's recall to have airbag inflators replaced, and is recalling 2.27million vehicles worldwide over fears the parts could explode

The recall involves around 20 Toyota models, including Tundra pickups made between 2003 and 2004

Of the total number of vehicles affected by the current recall, 650,000 are in Japan and 1.62million in the rest of the world.

Toyota said it was expanding the recall 
it announced in April 2013 that involved 2.1million vehicles because 
the serial numbers that parts maker Takata had provided were incomplete.

Nissan and Honda are also investigating whether to recall more vehicles after parts maker Takata admitted that it had not fully identified the flawed components during a 2013 recall.

Last year carmakers including Toyota, Honda, Nissan
 Motor Co and BMW recalled 3.6 million vehicles due to 
problems with the airbag inflator that could potentially explode and 
injure the driver or passengers.

Toyota said it had been notified of 
one case in which a defective airbag inflator had caused a seat cover to
 burn. It said all of the recalled vehicles were equipped with 
passenger-seat airbags that could be defective and deploy "abnormally" 
in the event of an accident.

Shares of Takata dropped after the announcement and were down over 4 percent when the Tokyo market closed.

In 2013 Nissan, Honda, Toyota and BMW recalled a total of 3.6million vehicles after the fault was discovered. Nissan and Honda are investigating whether they are affected by this new fault

Takata admitted it improperly stored chemicals and botched the manufacture of propellants used to inflate airbags, some of which were used in Honda vehicles

A Takata spokesman said that more vehicles could be recalled by other manufacturers because of potential airbag inflator defects.

Takata has acknowledged to U.S. safety regulators that it improperly stored chemicals and botched the manufacture of the explosive propellants used to inflate airbags.

The company has also said that it kept inadequate quality-control records which made it impossible to identify vehicles with potentially defective airbag inflators a decade or more after they were manufactured at factories in the United States and Mexico.

The Takata recall in 2013 was the largest airbag-related recall in history and came after a series of accidents and at least two deaths allegedly caused by faulty airbags.
