Asif Mallu, 37, was head of a company which made inflated claims for compensation

A claims company owner who made thousands of pounds through a series of car insurance crash scams has been branded 'outrageous' by a judge.

Asif Mallu, 37, was head of a business which made inflated claims for compensation after a team of cowboy drivers were paid £500 a time to stage a string of car crashes.

Over a three year period one hired driver staged a total of 93 road smashes by unexpectedly slamming the brakes at roundabouts so innocent motorists following had no chance of avoiding ploughing into the back of him.

The shocked motorists were then sued through accident claims firms for damages and injuries for an average £17,000 a time.

The scam was uncovered in 2005 when 
workers at an office block overlooking a roundabout on the A34 near 
Cheadle, Greater Manchester, spotted the same driver being involved in 
various low speed crashes of a striking similarity.

AXA insurance, one of the companies affected by the scam, investigated a number of the claims and alerted police in 2008.

Convicted robber Mallu had run claims management company 24/7 Direct Claims based in Bolton, Greater Manchester, which earned fees for referring people involved in car accidents to solicitors.

A court heard he created false invoices to support bogus claims for vehicle recovery, storage and repair after a number of car crashes.

He also represented fraudulent claimants in support of personal injury claims.

The scam which involved another accident claims firm was the biggest of its kind in Britain.

Today, Mallu, from Halliwell, in Bolton, the last man to face trial over the scam, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and was jailed for 21 months.

Passing sentence at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Judge Bernard Lever said: 'This is a particularly serious fraud which has become something of a public scandal.

'Millions and millions of pounds of motorists’ money and their inflated premiums are involved and this man has bought into a scandalous fraud the length and breadth of this country.

'The clearest message will come out of this court today - people who get in a crash for cash scam and you, will go to prison.'

He told Mallu: 'These cases are very very complex to investigate and it is very complex to bring people like you to justice.

'This man was going round and round the roundabout just stopping all of a sudden until somebody went into the back of him - and he could secure a fraudulent claim.

'This is absolutely outrageous behaviour which causes every single person’s premium in the country to go higher than it needs to be.

'You may not have been the person who was driving. You may not have been the person who made false claims and who was the owner of the vehicle.

'You may not have been the person in the vehicle who had falsely claimed whiplash - but you were from the claims company.

'For these claims to be pursued they needed claims managers like you in order to push on the production line. You were a necessary part of it.'

The
scam was revealed after office workers noticed that driver Mohammed Patel, then 24, was involved in five different smashes 
at the same roundabout. Further investigation found he was involved in another 88 across the North of England.

He was found to have earned at least £46,000 from his frauds and spent the money on a Mercedes C class coupe and a Lincoln Navigator cars, plus designer clothes, a plasma TV and exotic holidays.

Reports from an engineer showed the insurance claims for damage and whiplash were exaggerated and in some cases totally made up.

Patel was subsequently jailed for four and a half years for his role on the scam. But police said the biggest profit went to claims management companies such as 24/7, who processed the claims.

The court heard Mallu who was arrested in March 2009 was involved in seven different frauds which could have netted £67,000 but many were foiled. He was found to have made a personal profit of £12,000 and was ordered to pay back £7,250.

His counsel Miss Lisa Judge, defending, said: 'He had a troublesome childhood and was the black sheep of the family, so was disregarded.'

'He is a different man now. He is a changed man with many great and serious life experiences which have nurtured him significantly.

'He’s not the man which would have stood before you in 2005. He has a total change of perspective of life.'

But Chief Insp Mark Dexter of Greater
Manchester Police said: 'Mallu’s company was all a front for fraud. A 
long and complex investigation has proven that he profited significantly
from the scam.

'While 
insurance companies are victims, the innocent drivers involved in these 
collisions were made to feel as though they were in the wrong.

'The
scam left these victims feeling cheated and violated, often with their 
premiums increased, so the idea that this is a victimless crime is 
nonsense.”

During the 
inquiry police went to claims management companies in Bolton and Burnley
and a number of solicitors’ offices, from which they seized documents. 
In all 700 false claims were found to have been made.

Patel was arrested in August 2008 and when his home was searched officers found an 'Aladdins cave' full of 'expensive furniture and electrical equipment'.

Police recovered £2,136.09 in cash, a receipt for a £965 TV, rent payments totalling over £5,000, evidence of flights to Barcelona costing over £400, a £215 receipt for Selfridges, over £100 receipts for Toys R Us and Marks and Spencers, and several bank deposit slips totalling £1,300.
