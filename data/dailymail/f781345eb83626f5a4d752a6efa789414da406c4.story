A lesbian who sued a Catholic Archdiocese that fired her after she was impregnated via artificial insemination  won a lawsuit against her former employer Monday alleging the termination violated anti-discrimination laws and has been awarded more than $170,000.

The federal jury found the Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati discriminated against Christa Dias by firing her in 2010.

Though she declined to comment immediately after the ruling, in a telephone interview with the Associated Press, Dias later said that she was 'very happy and relieved.'

'Relieved': Seen here with her daughter, Christa Dias sued an Ohio archdiocese after she was fired for becoming pregnant via artificial insemination. A jury ruled in her favor, awarding her over $170,000 Monday

Her attorney had argued she was fired simply because she was pregnant and unmarried, while attorneyâ€™s for the defendant claimed

it was the artificial insemination that got her the boot.

It was the argument of archdiocese attorney Steven Goodin, that Dias agreed to a contract requiring her to follow Catholic teachings.

The church considers artificial insemination immoral and a violation of church doctrine, and the contract required her to comply with the philosophies and teachings of the Catholic church, Goodin said.

Discriminatory: A jury found that Dias, a computer teacher, was unfairly fired from two schools by the Cincinnati Catholic Archdiocese, which claimed she broke a contract that said she must follow Catholic doctrine

The jury said the archdiocese should pay $51,000 in back-pay, $20,000 in compensatory damages and $100,000 in punitive damages.

Dias, who taught computer classes, was fired by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati in October 2010 after informing the schools of her pregnancy, according to her attorney Robert Klingler.

Dias had sued the archdiocese and two of its schools. The schools were not found liable.

Dias is not Catholic but identifies as Christian. She said she was told that did not matter at her hiring. She also testified she didn't know artificial insemination violated church doctrine or the employment pact.

She said she thought the contract clause about abiding by church teachings meant she should be a Christian and follow the Bible.

Testifying on the second day of trial, Dias choked up at times and wiped tears from her eyes as she described her shock at being fired.

Dias also has claimed that the church policies are not enforced equally against men and women, as a male former employee who worked in the youth ministry program testified that his wife was artificially inseminated and he was not fired or disciplined.

Indoctrinated: Dias was fired by the archdiocese from two schools, including St. Lawrence school. She claimed in court she was unaware using artifical insemination violated her contract to obey chruch doctrine

Neither Dias nor the archdiocese claim she was fired because she is gay, and the judge told jurors that they could not consider sexual orientation in determining motivating factors for the firing.

However, Goodin argued that that Dias never intended to abide by her contract because she kept her sexual orientation a secret because she knew homosexual actsâ€”like artificial insemination, it seemsâ€”violated her contract.

'That all goes to her credibility,' Goodin said.

Dias, formerly from suburban Cincinnati, now lives in Atlanta with her partner and their 2-year-old daughter. They would have remained in Cincinnati if she had not been fired, Dias said.

While the lawsuit didn't seek a specific amount in damages, Klingler suggested in his closing argument that $200,000 in compensatory damages would not be unreasonable for what Dias went through with the loss of her job and health insurance and the worry she experienced.

Uprooted: Dias was also fired from the Holy Family School in Cincinnati. She has since relocated her 2-year-old daughter and partner to Atlanta, Georgia

He said Dias is not seeking punitive damages from the schools but that archdiocese officials knew or should have known that they were breaking the law and any punitive damages against the archdiocese should be double whatever compensatory damages might be set by the jury.

That would show that what church leaders did was wrong and shouldn't happen again, Klingler said. Lost back pay amounting to about $37,000 would bring the total damages suggested to about $637,000.

The case, viewed as a barometer on the degree to which religious organizations can regulate employees' lives, is the second lawsuit that's been filed in the last two years against the archdiocese over the firing of an unmarried pregnant teacher.
