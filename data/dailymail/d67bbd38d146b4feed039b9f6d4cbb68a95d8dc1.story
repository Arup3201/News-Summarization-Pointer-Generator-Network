A mother lost her baby son and husband in two tragedies only five days apart.

Rhian Burke, 35, was still reeling from the death of 12-month-old George from a fit, when her grief-stricken husband Paul plunged to his death from a motorway bridge.

At an inquest, a coroner recorded a  verdict of accidental death ‘rather than suicide’ because Mr Burke, 33, had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in the days after his son’s death.

Now Mrs Burke has set up a bereavement
charity and is calling for counsellors to call at the home of any 
parent who loses a child within 24 hours of their death.

She said: ‘I believe Paul would still be alive today if he had received immediate trauma counselling.

‘Paul and I were made to walk the 
length of the hospital with the nurse carrying our dead child, watching 
as other mothers went by with their pushchairs.

‘Then we were ushered out without any 
proper help or advice. That’s when I knew there was a major gap in the 
system, with nobody taking responsibility for bereavement support.

‘The current bereavement system in the NHS fails to offer any  aftercare, particularly for grieving fathers.’

Heartbreak: Baby George was rushed to hospital after suffering a fit but died hours later

Support: More than 450 people attended a joint funeral for Paul and George at Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff

In February last year, baby George suffered a fit while he was playing  at the family home in Miskin,  near Cardiff.

He was taken to hospital but died hours later.

Doctors later discovered the fit was brought on by influenza and bronchial pneumonia, which had not been diagnosed.

In the following days, the devastated 
couple started to plan George’s funeral and talked of taking their other
two young children on holiday to Lapland.

Mrs Burke said: ‘One minute we were a normal family getting on with life – the next it was all over.

‘Paul took the car for a drive. I didn’t think anything of it.

‘We had cried together and were planning funeral arrangements  for George.

‘I hadn’t noticed anything different in his character.

‘When I was given the news about Paul, it nearly killed me.

‘Paul should be here today to support me, but he isn’t.

‘I am in no way cross or angry  with what he did, as he was the kindest, loveliest person you could ever meet.

‘He was a very proud man who loved his family very much.’

More than 450 people attended a joint funeral for the father and son at Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff.

Mrs Burke’s 2 Wish Upon A Star charity
has since raised £50,000 to help improve bereavement support after 
charity balls and events were held in Mr Burke and George’s memory.

She said: ‘People ask me how I cope, but the charity work has really given me a focus.

‘I’m determined to change  things. It’s what my husband would have wanted.’
