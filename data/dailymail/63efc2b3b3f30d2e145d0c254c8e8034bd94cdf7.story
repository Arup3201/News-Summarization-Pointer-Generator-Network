In Bram Stoker’s vampire novel, sharp-toothed Count Dracula can hardly contain himself when his guest, Jonathan Harker, cuts himself shaving.

Now scientists have found the single chemical component in blood that creates the metallic scent that the fictional count found so irresistible.

They said that the undead aristocrat was reacting to an organic ‘aldehyde’ compound called trans-4,5-epoxy-(E)-2-decenal.

To pinpoint the compound, scientists from Linkoping University in Sweden conducted an experiment using zoo animals.

They impregnated lumps of wood with the lab-made chemical and found that it triggered a strong response from carnivores such as African and Asian wild dogs, South American bush dogs, and Siberian tigers.

On its own, the compound produced the same reactions - sniffing, licking, biting, pawing and toying - as horse blood.

The carnivores ignored logs coated with fruit essence and a near-odourless solvent.

Tigers reacted most strongly to the blood compound, while South American bush dogs lost interest more quickly than other species.

‘For predators, food scents are particularly attractive, and much of this has to do with blood,’ said lead scientist Professor Matthias Laska, of the university.

‘We wanted to find out which chemical components create the scent of blood.’

Prior to the research, little information existed on the substances that give blood its smell.

The team used sophisticated chemical analysis techniques that identified 30 candidate compounds.

It took the sensitive noses of human scent experts to single out the elusive aldehyde, which they recognised as emitting the distinctive metallic odour typically associated with blood.

The animals tests, which were conducted at Kolmarden Wildlife Park in Sweden, proved it was this that attracted meat-eating predators, but the scientists are not sure how the scent evolved.

Professor Laksa said: ‘How this has developed through evolution is an interesting question. Perhaps there is a common denominator for all mammalian blood.’

The research is published in the online journal Plos One. 

They found that the compund produced the same reactions - sniffing, licking, biting, pawing and toying - as horse blood in a variety of carnivores. Siberian tigers reacted most strongly to the blood compound

The novel may be based upon Vlad III Dracula of Wallachia (pictured) also known as Vlad the Impaler

Dracula is an 1897 Gothic horror novel by Irish author Bram Stoker.

The novel tells the story of Dracula's attempt to move from Transylvania to England so he can find new blood and spread the undead curse, as well as the battle between Dracula and a small group of men and women led by Professor Abraham Van Helsing.

While it is a work of fiction, the novel contains historical references.

It may be based upon Vlad III Dracula of Wallachia who is also known as Vlad the Impaler.

The aristocrat, who reigned from 1456 to 1462 is said to have killed up to 100,000 people by impaling them.

The name Dracula comes from a Chivalric order called the Order of the Dragon to uphold Christianity and defend the Empire against the Ottoman Turks. Vlad the Impaler wore the emblem of the order and the name Dracula means 'Son of Dracul'

It's said that Stoker came across the name Dracula in his reading on Romanian history, but experts dispute how much he knew about Vlad.

It's also been suggested that the author was influenced by the history of Hungarian Countess Elizabeth Bathory, who tortured and killed between 36 and 700 young women. 

It was later commonly believed that she committed these crimes to bathe in their blood, believing that this preserved her youth.
