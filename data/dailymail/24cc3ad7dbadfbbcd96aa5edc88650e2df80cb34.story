Two teenagers have been arrested and one man is on the run after they allegedly recorded themselves sexually assaulting an unconscious girl before posting the video on Snapchat.

Rashad Deihim, 19, is being sought by police while Kailyn Bonia, 18, and another male, 17, have been held after they allegedly filmed the attack in woods behind Waybright Elementary School in Sangus, Massachusetts.

Police found the severely intoxicated 16-year-old after a man who saw the graphic footage on the photo-sharing app recognized the location and led them to the scene.

Deihim is being sought by police after 'fleeing the state' while the other two have been held in custody

After he was shown the video by his daughter he rushed to the scene. He was then joined by a group of officers who found the alleged victim covered in cuts and bruises and wearing only a shirt.

Judge Ellen Flately said the victim also had ligature marks around her neck and 'could have died'. 

According to the Boston Herald,  Bonia has been charged with assault with intent to rape, indecent assault and battery on a person over 14, exhibiting or posing a child in a state of nudity, and kidnapping. 

Deihim is believed to have fled the state and is wanted for the same charges as Bonia, according to court documents.

Another male, 17, who is is said to have recorded the footage is also facing the same charges and has also been accused of distributing child pornography.

A report by an officer who arrived at the scene said: 'The female appeared to be extremely intoxicated. I conducted a search of the area and located what we believe is the scene where the sexual activity took place on a floral print couch in the wooded area about 100 feet from the baseball field.'

The victim was taken to Melrose-Wakefield Hospital  where doctors said she was under the influence of drugs.

According to reports, when Bonia was arrested she called Deihim to alert him and said: 'Dude, I'm like being held for all these charges. Where is (juvenile defendant), this is all his fault. They should have him.'

The app has been accused of facilitating young people sending indecent or even illegal images to each other 

The app allows users to send photos, videos and messages from their mobile phones. 

It launched in 2011 with messages and images would automatically deleting themselves within ten seconds of being opened by the recipient.

Today, Snapchat users send 400 million photos and videos every single day, matching the daily uploads to Facebook and Instagram. The average age of users is 18. 

Last year Snapchat turned down a £1.8 billion ($3 billion) offer from Facebook, and while some doubted the app could grow further, the company was valued at a staggering £6 billion (£10 billion) two weeks ago.

But despite the success, it has been mired in controversy. 

It has been accused of facilitating young people sending indecent and even illegal images to each other in a form of messaging now known as sexting.

The app allows you to even send photos to people you have only met online and have not come face-to-face with.

In Canada in November when ten teenage boys were arrested on child porn charges for saving and sharing Snapchat images of girls aged between 13 and 15. 

The girls sent the pictures believing they would disappear, not knowing there were ways of negating the time limit. 

Previously, Snapchat founder Evan Spiegel has dismissed concerns about sexting, arguing that because 80 per cent of the images are swapped during daylight he believes they are unlikely to have a sexual element.  

In May, the company agreed to settle with the Federal Trade Commission over charges that it deceived customers about the disappearing nature of messages sent through its service.

The hit app came under fire after it failed to tell users that others could save their messages without their knowledge, and collected users' contacts without telling them or asking permission.
