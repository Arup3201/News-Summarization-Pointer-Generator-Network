The morning mist had yielded to soothing autumn sunshine when Lee Westwood came trampling off the 18th green at Celtic Manor. He was in high good humour, having concluded an excellent round of 68 with an eagle at the last. He shook a flock of hands, posed for a stream of ‘selfies’ and signed his name on a frantic flutter of books and caps.

And he remembered to smile his thanks every time somebody said: ‘Good luck next week.’

Next week: it was at the forefront of every mind, especially in the valley where Europe reclaimed Sam Ryder’s pot by a single point just four years ago.

Lee Westwood has the drive and motivation to succeed next week in his ninth Ryder Cup with Europe

Westwood played his full part in that victory; indeed, his glassy-eyed grin as he lurched from the clubhouse balcony is a vivid memory of that happy Monday. But those antics are in the past: the future begins at Gleneagles, on Friday.

For the past few days, Celtic Manor has been staging the Wales Open. It is an admirable tournament in its own right, but this week it has been reduced to a prelude, an appetiser for the main event.

Inevitably, mutterings of ‘next week’ have rippled around the galleries whenever the four European representatives were in action.

Of that quartet, Stephen Gallacher endured a calamitous opening day and made a premature departure. But Thomas Bjorn has been stolidly consistent, Jamie Donaldson has been impressively productive, and Westwood has been unfailingly interesting.

Having played in eight Ryder Cups, and having helped to win six of them, he understands just what the event represents.

‘I always say that only golfers used to watch the Ryder Cup,’ he says. ‘Now people who are interested in sport watch it. It’s not just golfers. I have people coming up to me saying they’ve never picked a club up in their life, but they thought the last day of the past Ryder Cup was the most enthralling day of sport. They couldn’t get off the couch. They had things to do but they were just captivated by the whole thing.

‘I’m not a Liverpool fan, but I was captivated by the second half in Istanbul when they came back from 3-0 down (in 2005). The Ryder Cup has been the same for non-golfers. It’s changed dramatically.’

 

Since his 1997 debut, Westwood has earned 21 points and been a key man in six victorious Ryder Cup teams. He has been on the losing side twice.

Fourballs             14     8       4       2

He is acutely aware of how the contest brought him a kind of redemption as a golfer. Having led the European merit list in 2000, he took time off to reshape his swing and drifted out to 75th in 2002. But in the 2002 match at The Belfry, he joined with Sergio Garcia in a stunningly successful partnership which brought them three wins out of four.

From there on, he moved back to the heights he had once commanded, all the way to world No 1. He remembers it warmly: ‘Sergio helped me a lot. He was the perfect partner for me. It gave my career a kickstart.

‘This could be the same. Any time you play well under pressure, and next week will be the most intense pressure you will ever experience, it makes a difference.

‘It was nice to play well and not let anybody down, because I hadn’t been playing particularly well going into that Ryder Cup. But it also triggered something in my head that made me realise I was still a good player and I could still do it under pressure. I guess I owe the Ryder Cup something for helping to restore my belief.’

The Celtic Manor crowd instinctively embraces Westwood, as if recognising a man who suffers and celebrates just like them. For all his experience and wealth, accumulated through two decades as a tour player, he retains a touch of Everyman. When he announced that he had shed 23lbs in three weeks, he seemed rather proud of his achievement. Nobody was cruel enough to enquire how a top sportsman can carry so much excess baggage. It was Westwood. This is his way.

He moves around the course with an aldermanic waddle, his face a mirror of his mood. The good shots bring a flashing beam, the indifferent efforts the darkest scowl. You sense that the game remains important to him, that the drive for perfection is intact, no matter that he had to rely on a wild card for Ryder Cup selection. You also sense that his influence on the young players may well prove crucial next week.

He understands what is expected: ‘Any time it’s your first Ryder Cup, you will need a helping hand, an arm around the shoulder, no matter how old you are. It’s a shock. The intensity and atmosphere is the difference. The discipline is just the same.’

He adds: ‘You put a tee in the ground with a bit of grass on it. It’s the same little white ball you play all year, the same driver behind it. Nothing’s changed, except the 25,000 people that feel like they are on top of you, all screaming’.

He also appreciates the team dynamic. ‘Even when games are being lost on the course, if someone wins a couple of holes and goes from three down to one down, that can spur people on to come back in their game,’ he says. ‘I think it was Peter Hanson in front of me against Jason Dufner, and Peter was five down or something and he got it back to two down and you think “Oh, Pete’s on a comeback now”, and it lifts you, even though he was losing his match.

‘That’s what you try and impress on everybody. If you’re losing, keep sticking in and strange things can happen.’

An air of contentment sits well on Westwood, especially on this softly successful day in South Wales. Next week will be quite different. It will be a genuine sporting ordeal.

In such circumstances, can he actually enjoy the game he clearly loves? He considers. ‘There are moments when you can laugh and enjoy it. Just looking at the crowd and appreciating that there are 20,000 people lined up on the bank beside the 16th cheering for you. It frames the hole. There’s no experience in golf that’s anywhere close to the atmosphere of a Ryder Cup.’

Saturday evening found him at the driving range; working, concentrating, seeking that critical edge. Sunday he will enjoy another joust with Celtic Manor. Then the circus pitches tent in Gleneagles. Next week, as the crowds kept repeating. Next week, with the great game to be played, and history waiting to be made.
