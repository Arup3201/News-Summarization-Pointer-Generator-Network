Katie Couric may soon be doing her daytime yakking elsewhere.

Rumor has it the former news anchor turned talk show host may be joining ‘The View’ next year. She would replace retiring television legend Barbara Walters, according to the New York Daily News.

This news comes on the heels of slumping ratings for ‘Katie’ and buzz Ms Couric isn’t happy about her show’s slant towards celebrity gossip during its second season.

With rating spiralling downward on her daytime talk show and ABC executives searching feverishly for a brand name to replace the iconic Ms Walters, Ms Couric would seem like a natural fit.

‘Katie may ultimately replace Barbara when she retires,’ a source told the paper.

The former ‘Today’ host is looking for a way out of her namesake talk show after a format shift overseen by former ‘Tyra Banks Show’ executive producer Rachel Miskowiec, said the Daily News.

Ms Walters announced in May that she would take a step back from her on-air duties at ‘The View,’ but plans to remain an executive producer of the morning talkfest.

The source told the Daily News that the timing would save Ms Couric the humiliation of having her show publicly cancelled as ratings continue to slide, and look more like she was Ms Walters’ heir apparent.

‘Execs are so concerned about publicly humiliating Katie by canceling her show in the middle of her second season that they want to put her on ‘The View’ this year to slide into Barbara’s chair,’ the source added.

In a nod to her success at ‘Today,’ but her mediocre ratings while anchor of the ‘CBS Evening News,’ the source added that ‘The feeling across the board is that Katie is rejected by audiences when she is alone, but on a panel show she’s incredible, and even not liking her can work in the show’s favor and her favour.’

Producers have also been looking for a Latina woman to join the show’s panel, the source told the paper.

No chance: Ms Walters denies Ms Couric will take her seat on 'The View'

Ms Walters, the show’s creator, praised Ms Couric, but in the same breath denied to the Daily News that she will join the show.

‘I love Katie and we are good friends,’ Babs said. ‘She is always welcome as a guest on ‘The View’ and I was recently a guest on her show, but there is no truth to the rumor that she will be taking my place on ‘The View.’

A message left by MailOnline for further comment with a rep for Ms Walters has not been returned.

Ms Walters previously denied rumors she would retire, only to make the announcement on ‘The View’ herself.
