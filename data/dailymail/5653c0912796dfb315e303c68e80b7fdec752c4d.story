British Gas and the charity Shelter.

Over
 the coming weeks, we want you to nominate the special women who deserve
 to be recognised. Here, we tell the story of one of our remarkable 
nominees . . .

Debby Walch had barely switched out the light when the phone on her bedside table started ringing. A few hurried words and minutes later Debby, accompanied by husband Michael, was zooming off in her car on another mercy mission.

This time, the crisis call came from  73-year-old Gladys, who had been frightened by a mysterious banging sound on her door.

'Michael and I toured the property and couldn't see anything,' Debby smiles, recalling last week's late-night outing. 'It was probably simply a tree branch brushing against her door. But there was no way I could have just turned over and gone to sleep without checking.

'I know Gladys would have sat up in her chair all night scared out of her wits. And I couldn't have that. After giving her a cuddle and making her a nice hot cup of cocoa, I helped her back into bed and knew she'd sleep soundly.

'Isn't that what everyone would do?'

Always on call: Debby Walch is available, day and night, for the elderly residents of Old Ben Homes

If only. This selfless approach is how Debby, 53, came to be nominated for the Daily Mail's Inspirational Women of the Year competition, run in association with British Gas and the charity Shelter.

She was put forward for the award by the residents of Old Ben Homes, a complex of sheltered housing for the elderly based in Seaford, East Sussex.

As manager of the complex, which is home to 47 residents aged from 60 to 103, who all live in their own self-contained bungalows, Debby is paid to work only from 9am to 5pm, five days a week.

However, the elderly residents in Debby's care say that they can contact her any time on her landline or mobile phone and she will leave her home half a mile away at a moment's notice if they need her.If they use an emergency panic button, the plea for help is directed to a call centre, but the call centre is under strict instructions to alert Debby immediately.

'My residents trust me to be there for them,' says Debby, who lives in Seaford with Michael, 52, who posts billboards for companies.

'Can you imagine how frightened they would be having paramedics turn up without me being there to comfort and reassure them?

'If they have to go to hospital, I can pack a little bag for them and check they've got all their medicine.'

And when any of her residents has a long spell in hospital, Debby is sure to turn up at their bedside with a hug and a cheery smile.

'Most managers sign off at 5pm every day, but that's not good enough for Debby,' explains Rita Jones, 79, one of the residents who has benefited many times from her kindness.

'Although she doesn't live on site but a few minutes away, she gets in her car and comes rushing round if any of us has a problem.

'She's outstanding and we honestly don't know what we would do without her. Take me. I've got two replacement hips and knees. When I fell a few weeks ago and couldn't get up again, I called Debby. Even though it was a Saturday morning - her day off - she was here within ten minutes.

'She stayed with me until the paramedics came and even accompanied me to hospital for a check-up because she knew I was scared. Nothing's too much trouble for her.' Debby, who worked as a childminder for 20 years before taking her job at Old Ben's in February 2010, shrugs off the praise.

'I genuinely love looking after my elderly people,' she says. 'And the fact I can make their lives more enjoyable makes me so happy.

'I see it as my chance to give back a little. I treat my residents the way I'd treat my own mum. I was very close to Mum - who lived at the complex herself for six years until she died of cancer in May 2007 aged 73.

Loyalty: 'My residents trust me to be there for them', says Debby, who is the manager of the complex

'We spoke every day and, when she died, there was a huge hole in my life. I'd already lost my father, who died, also of cancer, when he was in his early 50s.

'It may sound as though I do a lot, but I get back much more than I give.

'Looking after my lovely elderly ladies and gentlemen is like  having a huge extended family. We laugh and we cry together - just like in a family. When someone dies, we are all down. And when someone has a birthday or a new grandchild, we all join in the celebrating.

'Of course, some have their own families and get regular visitors, but many don't. When I say goodbye to them on Friday evening, many won't see a soul until I come back on Monday morning and that's so sad.'

Debby, who's mum to Ricky, 33, Jamie, 31 and Mitchell, 22 and grandma to Caitlin, 12 and Gracie, three, starts every day with a roll call.

'I pop around to each house with my register. It's like checking who's in class today, and we always have a good laugh about it. It's a chance to chat about anything my ladies and gentlemen are worried about. I help them with everything from organising eye tests to helping with tricky knitting patterns.

And with Debby around there's absolutely no chance of the residents getting bored. The communal hall - which used to be deserted under the old manager - is now a hive of activity. There are 'knit and natter' and craft mornings, Scrabble and bingo afternoons, and fish and chip suppers.

Residents enjoy an Easter  Bonnet Parade, a Christmas Party and regular cream teas just for the fun of it. Money for treats is raised by the residents.

'We do our own version of the National Lottery every week and there's always a winner,' explains Debby. 'Michael came up with the idea of each resident paying £1 and choosing their favourite  numbers. They then have their house number tagged on.

'It means someone wins every week. We all get excited for the winner, who gets to keep £40, and we put money left over - £9 a week - into the kitty.'

At weekends there are often trips out. Recently, Debby piled 25 residents into a minibus and, with husband Michael bringing up the rear in his car, they all set off for a day at the dog races in Brighton, followed by lunch and a drive along the seafront.

'All the wheelchairs and Zimmer frames take some managing,' Debby grins. 'But getting out and having fun is a tonic for everyone - me included.'

Debby makes a point of remembering all her residents' birthdays and she buys them all Christmas presents - diaries for the ladies and liqueur chocolates for the men. Needless to say she's inundated with cards and gifts when it comes to her own birthday.

'I try to keep the date secret, but they always find out somehow. Last year I got 40 cards and more boxes of chocolates than I could possibly eat,' she laughs.

But while the residents love Debby for her unstinting energy and good humour, it's her willingness to step in day or night that is truly exceptional.

Take Rodney and Ethel. When Ethel, 85, was diagnosed with  terminal cancer she wanted to stay at home as long as possible.

With Ethel's children living too far away to help their mother, her GP was reluctant to let her stay at home, and it was only when Debby offered to help Ethel's 90-year-old husband Rodney care for her that she was allowed to remain in the home she loved.

With the help of the Macmillan nurses who called in regularly, Debby was able to fulfil Ethel's wishes. 'I was on call 24/7. I don't think I got an undisturbed night for two weeks. But I honestly didn't mind,' says Debby. 'Ethel only went into hospital at the very end.

'When the hospital rang me at 6am to say she was dying, I got Rodney up and dressed and we drove over there together. Although we arrived just too late and cried in each other's arms, the comfort Rodney got from knowing he had done all his wife wanted was enormous.

'I was so pleased that I was able to help it happen. My residents have cared for others all their lives. Now it's their turn to be cared for.'
