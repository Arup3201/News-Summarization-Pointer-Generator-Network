 Second-tier French club Nimes will be relegated at the end of the season after its former president was found guilty of trying to fix matches.

After interviewing about 50 officials, players and coaches, the French league disciplinary commission says Jean-Marc Conrad tried to fix four matches as his club fought off relegation last season. He was banned from football-related activities for seven years.

Seven games involving Nimes were investigated after Conrad was arrested last November. 

Nimes' former club president Jean-Marc Conrad was arrested for his involvement in match-fixing last year 

The investigation followed a 1-1 draw against Caen last May that kept Nimes in the second division and saw Caen promoted to the top flight. 

Preliminary charges of corruption have been filed against Caen president Jean-Francois Fortin and Conrad, who has stepped down in the aftermath of the scandal.

Nimes can appeal the sanction.
