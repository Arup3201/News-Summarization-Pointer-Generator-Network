Russian cosmonauts could be living on the Moon by 2030 under leaked plans drawn up by the country's space agency.

A draft government programme proposes a three-step plan to explore the Moon that would culminate in building a permanent Earth-monitoring observatory.

The document stressed the urgency of getting there before other nations, saying 'leading space powers will expand and establish their rights to convenient lunar footholds' in the next 20 to 30 years.

Red dawn? Russian cosmonauts could be living on the Moon by 2030 and use local resources to build Earth- and space-monitoring observatories, according to plans drawn up by the Kremlin and Russia's space agency

Moscow's plans, seen by Russian broadsheet Izvestia and reported in translation by the Moscow Times, call for a robotic craft to be sent to the Moon by 2016, with a manned mission by 2028.

The final stage of the plan is for cosmonauts to use local resources to build an initial Moon base by 2030, followed by the construction of space- and Earth-monitoring observatories.

With Nasa's sights apparently firmly set on Mars, despite struggling against years of funding cuts, Russia appears to have a relatively open field in the newest leg of the space race.

The Kremlin has fired the starting pistol on its new space race less than three years after the U.S. was forced to start hitching flights on Russian rockets.

Nasa ended its space shuttle programme in 2011 and has faced years of funding cuts.

Just last month a Soyuz rocket carried two Russian cosmonauts and a U.S. astronaut to the International Space Station (above), despite the crisis in Ukraine and tough talking on sanctions.

China, Japan and India have all announced their intention to launch fresh missions to the Moon, which was last visited by humans in 1976.

But Russia's space programme, which achieved the first manned space flight in 1961, is far ahead and is the only one to explicitly call for manned lunar missions.

Just a fortnight ago, the Roscosmos announced plans for the massive new 'super-rockets' capable of lifting payloads of up to 120 tonnes into space.

The latest report was prepared by by the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Roscosmos federal space agency, Moscow State University and several space research institutes.

It envisages international cooperation but stresses the 'independence of the national lunar programme must be ensured regardless of the conditions and extend of participation by foreign partners.'

The document appears to be an 
expansion on plans to first set out by Moscow last month, when deputy PM
 Dmitry Rogozin dramatically announced: 'We are coming to the Moon 
forever.'

In an article in the government's own newspaper headlined 'Russian Space', he spoke of targeting Mars and other 'space objects' as future priorities.

'Flights to Mars and asteroids in our view do not contradict exploration of the moon, but in many senses imply this process.'

'We are coming to the Moon forever': Russian deputy PM Dmitry Rogozin first outlined his country's plans for lunar exploration and colonisation last month

He wrote of 'colonisation of the moon and near-moon space'.

In the next 50 years, manned flights are unlikely beyond 'the space between Venus and Mars'. But 'it is quite possible to speak about exploration of Mars, flights to asteroids and flights to Mars'.

The essential first step as a base for research and experiments was the moon, said Mr Rogozin, who is in overall charge of Russia's space and defence industries, and was recently targeted for sanctions over the Ukraine crisis.

'The moon is not an intermediate point in the race,' he wrote in official daily Rossiiskaya Gazeta, conjuring an impression of a new space race with America.

'It is a separate, even a self-contained goal.

'It would hardly be rational to make some ten or 20 flights to the moon, and then wind it all up and fly to the Mars or some asteroids.

'This process has the beginning, but has no end. We are coming to the moon forever.'

Russia was in the Soviet era behind many of the pioneering accomplishments in space flight, allowing them to claim an early lead in the space race.

Early achievements included the first intercontinental ballistic missile, the first satellite and the first animal in space in 1957, the first human in space in 1961, the first space walk in 1965, the first unmanned moon landing in 1966 and the first space station in 1971.

The U.S. soon caught up and put the first man on the surface of the moon, Neil Armstrong, in 1969.
