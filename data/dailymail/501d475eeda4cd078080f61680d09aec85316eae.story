The nephew of a Philadelphia mother-of-two who was strangled to death last week has been arrested after police say he was caught trying to burglarize her home after her funeral. 

Steven Anderson, 32, knew no one would home to stop him when he and Brandon Howard, 27 tried to pry open to back door of her house Wednesday morning, police say. 

Anderson's aunt Connie Murray, 46, was found strangled to death in a park after going for a jog on August 4. Her husband Christopher Murray, 48, has confessed to her murder and is behind bars. The couple's two young daughters are being looked after by relatives.

Mourners laid Connie Murray to rest on Monday.

WTXF-TV reports that a vigilant neighbor spotted the two men trying to break into her house about 2am Wednesday and called police. 

Authorities say Anderson tried to tell cops that he was just checking on the house with a friend. 

However, both men are career burglars and have lengthy arrest records. Anderson had pleaded guilty to burglary just one month ago and received probation. Howard had been released from jail just one day before his arrest. 

'One defendant knew that nobody was home and knew the circumstances,' Philadelphia police Lieutenant Dennis Rosenbaum told WTXF. 

Neighbors, who are still dealing with the shock of Mrs Murray's death and her husband's arrest, are furious and say they can't believe someone would stoop so low as to break into a murder victim's house.

'Let everybody else know, everybody watching. Everybody's watching,' family friend Tom Fogarty said.
