Japan’s penchant for heated toilets has resulted in an Australian invasion of deadly redback spiders.

An Australian song that warns people to ‘beware of the redback spider on the toilet seat at night’ couldn't be more true than in Japan after large numbers of the potentially fatal insect have been found in a Tokyo suburb.

The dangerous long-legged spider with a distinctive red body is a native of Australia, but somehow has found its way to Japan, where it lurks in dark corners.

The long-legged spider is a native of Australia, but has found its way to Japan and is believed to have survived their harsh winters thanks to heat spread into bathroom walls from the toilet seats

Experts had initially believed the tropical spider could never survive the bitingly-cold Japanese winters - but it is now thought that the heated toilets many Japanese have in their homes have provided a perfect winter hideaway.

While the insects haven’t literally slept the winter away under Japanese toilet seats, the warmth spread from them into bathroom walls has provided comfort from the cold.

Now, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reports, Australian experts have warned that Japan’s medical system is not ready for an invasion of the potentially deadly spider because limited supplies of anti-venom are available to authorities.

About a dozen of the venomous insects have been found in the Tokyo residential district of Mitaka, terrifying parents.

Although the insects were quickly rounded up and exterminated, government official Motosugu Tanaka said local authorities would not be able to stop them from moving into other areas.

‘It’s unthinkable that they only exist in Mitaka, so they’ll probably be found in many other areas of Tokyo from now on,’ he said.

At Japan’s National Institute for Environmental Studies, Dr Koichi Goka admitted that the Japanese medical system was not prepared for the spider’s spread.

‘The medical system is behind,’ he told the Australian broadcaster.

‘They have anti-venom in Osaka and Fukuoka but other provinces don’t have supplies. So it’s a serious issue and hasn’t been addressed.’ 

Redbacks are potentially fatal for small children, a fact Australians are taught at a young age. 

As Japan slowly becomes aware of the dangers of the bright-red spider, a school education programme has started in schools to ensure that children don’t make the fatal mistake of picking them up.

The programme warns youngsters that if they see small spiders ‘with a pretty red back, don’t touch them.’ 

It was in 1995 that the spider was first detected in Japan, in the city of Osaka, possibly arriving on a ship carrying fruit or wooden products from Australia. 

Since then, they have spread to other parts of the country so that their numbers are estimated to be in the many thousands.

They do not have any natural enemies, they have ample food - and they have those warm toilets and other efficient heating systems to see them through the winter.

The redbacks are reported to have bitten about 100 people in Japan. but so far there have been no fatalities. 

But experts fear that with their numbers growing - and relatively little anti-venom available - the risks of a fatality are increasing.
