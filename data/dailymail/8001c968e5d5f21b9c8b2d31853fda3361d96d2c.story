A controversial goal helped Roma to a 1-0 win at Udinese in Serie A on Tuesday, highlighting the need for goal-line technology. 

Davide Astori's header in the 17th minute hit the underside of the crossbar and bounced down near visiting goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis.

The goal-line official ruled that the ball did not entirely cross the line but after protests from Roma the referee overruled him, sparking outrage from Udinese. Replays were inconclusive.

'The goal-line official told me it wasn't a goal but it's the referee who decides and I think he saw it correctly,' Astori said.

Roma moved provisionally level with leader Juventus, who are hosting Inter Milan later in the day as the Italian league returned to full action after the winter break.

The win also put Roma nine points ahead of third-place Lazio ahead of Sunday's Rome derby.

Udinese remained in the middle of the table, 17 points behind.

Francesco Totti, Roma's 38-year-old captain, set up the goal with a free kick that Astori met in the center of the area at the Stadio Friuli.

Totti was up against Antonio Di Natale in a matchup of the league's two top active career scorers.

Totti is second all-time with 237 goals in 571 appearances and Di Natale is seventh on the list with 201 in 404 matches.

Silvio Piola, who won the 1938 World Cup with Italy, has the record of 274 goals.

Di Natale provided a perfect ball for Gabriel Silva in the 27th but the Brazilian couldn't find the target.

Roma forward Adem Ljajic was carried off on stretcher in the 83rd following a hard tackle by Giovanni Pasquale.

Udinese protested for a penalty when Urby Emanuelson made contact with Panagiotis Kone inside the area in the 85th but the referee ruled to play on, resulting in more protests from the hosts and a management member on Udinese's bench being sent off.

Goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis stopped solid chances from Emanuelson and Alessandro Florenzi in injury time but Udinese couldn't produce any serious opportunities at the other end.

However, the match will be remembered for the controversy surrounding the goal, bolstering Italian football federation president Carlo Tavecchio's desire to install instant replay for next season.

Goal-line technology was used at last year's World Cup but hasn't yet been approved for Serie A.

Also later, fourth-place Napoli were visiting struggling Cesena and AC Milan were facing Sassuolo at the San Siro. On Monday, Lazio beat Sampdoria 3-0.
