Jeff Bauman today returned to the Boston Marathon finish line - the spot where he lost both of his legs in the deadly bombings last year.

Bauman, who used his prosthetic legs and crutches to stand, cheered racers alongside his pregnant fiancee, Erin Hurley, and fellow survivor Adrianne Haslet-Davis, a dancer who lost one of her feet.

He also sat just a few feet away from Carlos Arredondo, who became known as 'the man in the cowboy hat' after he was pictured rushing an ashen-faced Bauman to medical care last year.

The two men, who have become firm friends since the tragedy brought them together, were pictured fist pumping and laughing together.

'It feels great' to be back, Bauman said. 'I feel very safe.'

It was Bauman's first time back to the scene since the two bombs exploded last year, killing three, wounding more than 260 people and claiming both of his legs.

But since the tragic day, the 28-year-old has battled surgeries to get back on his feet again with the help of friends, relatives, colleagues and one-time strangers.

Last week, on the one-year anniversary of the April 15 attack, he penned an open letter to the city of Boston, thanking everyone for their kindness.

'Thank you for being there for me,' he wrote. 'Thank you for kicking ass. Thank you for proving that nothing will ever stop us from being who we are.'

In the letter, he thanked those people who rushed to his aid - 'without your courage, I would not be alive today' - doctors, nurses and police officers: 'You acted like we were people, not victims.'

He also thanked people across the country for sending messages, gifts and donations.

'Especially the children who broke open their piggy banks to send us their life savings,' he wrote. 'Thank you. You changed our lives.'

In an interview with ABC last week, his rescuer Arredondo revealed he still suffers flashbacks, is unable to sleep and is uneasy in large crowds. His wife Melida said she also suffers from nightmares and sees a counselor.

But the couple, who lost both of their sons - one to a sniper in Iraq and the other to suicide - said that the bombings have allowed them a second chance at family.

'Jeff and Erin, they fill a place - they never could never replace Alex or Brian - but having them in our lives eases things,' Melida Arredondo said. 'It helps, and we just enjoy spending time together.'  

On Monday morning, nearly 36,000 runners set out from the Boston Marathon starting line in a 'Boston Strong' show of resilience a year after the bombing.

To the delight of the crowd, an American won the men's division for the first time in more than three decades, dominating a field that included many athletes who were prevented from finishing last year.

Meb Keflezighi's time of 2:08:37 made him the first U.S. male to win the storied foot race since 1983, and the 39-year-old crossed the finish line to a roaring crowd.

'It was my dream to win Boston and to make it just like the Red Sox did and do the same thing for the people,' Keflezighi said after the race.

The names of bombing victims Martin Richard, 8, Krystle Campbell, 29,  and Lu Lingzi, 23, were written on his bib. MIT Officer Sean Collier, shot dead 3 days after the marathon, was also included.

Police were deployed in force along the route, with helicopters circling above and bomb-sniffing dogs checking through trash cans. Officers were posted on roofs.

Boston Marathon race director Dave McGillivray said it had been a long and difficult year.

'We're taking back our race,' he said. 'We're taking back the finish line.'
