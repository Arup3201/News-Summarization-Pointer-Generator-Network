Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been criticised by indigenous leaders after he repeatedly stated that the arrival of the First Fleet 'was the defining moment in the history of this continent'.

Among them include Warren Mundine, chairman of the Prime Minister's Indigenous Advisory Council, told ABC Radio that white settlement was 'a disastrous defining moment for indigenous people'.

Mr Abbott made the comments at the opening of a history exhibition at the National Museum in Canberra on Friday, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

'It was the moment this continent became part of the modern world. It determined our language, our law and our fundamental values. Yes, it did dispossess and for a long time marginalise Indigenous people,' Mr Abbott said.

'As Noel Pearson frequently reminds us, modern Australia has an important Indigenous and multicultural character. Still it's British settlement that has most profoundly shaped the country that we are.'

Matilda House, head of the Stolen Generation Council for NSW, also  disapproved Mr Abbott's comments.

'I can't fathom how a ship or a boat sailed into Sydney Habour can overtake the 60,000 years before,' she told the ABC on Saturday.

In July, Mr Abbott landed himself in hot water after he said Australia was unsettled before British colonisation.

He made the comments during an address at the Melbourne Institute, saying Australia was unimaginable without foreign investment.

'I guess our country owes its existence to a form of foreign investment by the British government in the then unsettled or, um, scarcely settled, Great South Land,' he said on July 4.

The Australian Prime Minister landed himself in hot water nearly two months ago after he said that Australia was 'unsettled' before the British arrived

But Australia's first female Aboriginal federal parliamentarian Senator Nova Peris said the comments hindered efforts to have her people recognised in the constitution.

The comments were hurtful, dismissive of indigenous Australians and incorrect, she said.

In a statement to the ABC, Ms Peris said: 'British settlement was not a foreign investment. It was invasion.'

'The comments from the Prime Minister have not just offended Aboriginal Australians but many people around the country.'

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has also hit out at the prime minister for his previous comments.

He said Mr Abbott's remark was offensive, especially from a prime minister who claimed to be dedicated to indigenous affairs.

Mr Mundine labelled the comments silly and bizarre.
