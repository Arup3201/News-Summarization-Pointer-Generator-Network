A grandmother has been given a £250 reward by a judge after she locked a burglar in her garden shed.

Judith Gazzard, 69, of Cinderford, Gloucestershire, was woken in the early hours by the sound of drug addict Jason Marshall, 25, breaking into her conservatory - where, bizarrely, he ate bird feed.

Without waking her husband Julian, Mrs Gazzard crept downstairs and found the conservatory ransacked and the door ajar. Then she spotted a flickering torchlight in the shed a few yards away.

Heroic actions: Judith Gazzard, 69, of Cinderford, Gloucestershire, was woken in the early hours by the sound of a drug addict breaking into her conservatory - where he bizarrely ate bird feed

She tiptoed up to the door, then slammed and bolted it shut before calling police. Officers arrived minutes later to find Marshall on the floor after eating three Magnum ice creams from her freezer.

At Gloucester Crown Court, Marshall, of Coleford, Gloucestershire, was jailed for 16 months after he admitted burling the home of the retired civil servant and her husband on July 30.

At the time of the burglary he was wearing an electronic tag because he was on curfew as part of his sentence following earlier offences.

Mrs Gazzard said after the sentencing: ‘I didn’t think for a second about my own safety, I was just really angry that someone had got into my house. I was livid and I thought, “How dare he?”

‘At first when I heard the noise I thought it was one of our neighbours who gets up very early putting his bin out. I got up and listened by the window and then put on my housecoat and slippers and went down to see what was happening.

‘When I walked into the conservatory it 
was like a bombsite in there. I couldn’t see anything missing but 
someone had helped himself to a couple of handfuls of the suet pellets 
we give the birds.

‘They contain mealworms and insects so I don’t know what he made of them. I went out onto the patio wondering what the hell was going on and I saw a light in the shed.

‘I thought, “There’s somebody in there” - so I went quietly down the path. I realised the padlock on the door had been forced and wasn’t there - the police actually found it in the burglar’s pocket later.

‘But we have an outside bolt at the top of the door so I quickly locked him in. He realised he was in trouble because he started rattling the door but he never said a word and neither did I.

‘I went back into the house and woke my husband and he went out with a big torch and shone it through the shed window. He could see the man crouched down on the floor with his hoodie up.

‘Julian stood against the door to prevent the man trying to force it open and I called the police. It was quite comical when they arrived.

‘One of the officers opened the shed door and said “All right buddy, who are you then?” I heard a little voice say “Jason”. The policeman said "Jason who?" and the man said "Jason Marshall".’

'I didn’t think for a second about my own safety, I was just really angry that someone had got into my house. I was livid and I thought, "How dare he?"'

Judith Gazzard

Mrs Gazzard said she and her husband 
found later that Marshall had also tried to get into their motorhome, 
which is parked up against the front of the shed.

She added: ‘It was quite funny when the policeman asked me “Did you have some Magnum ice creams in your freezer?” I said "yes" and he told me “Well, he’s eaten them all”.

‘It was only much later that I thought about the risk I’d taken. My husband asked me why I didn’t wake him - and he said he would never have done what I did.’

Bizarre: Mrs Gazzard in her conservatory, where Marshall ate some of her bird food before breaking into the shed - where she bolted him in

Praising Mrs Gazzard’s bravery, Judge 
William Hart ordered that she be paid a £250 reward by the High Sheriff 
of Gloucestershire.

The 
judge told Marshall: ‘This was a night time burglary of an occupied 
house and you were caught because of the very brave and commendable 
behaviour of the lady of the house.

‘At great risk to herself she went in pursuit of you across the garden to the shed and locked you in. You were only caught because of what she did.’

In a citation to the High Sheriff, the judge added: ‘She could see a light in the shed but she had no idea what the nature of that person was in the dark.

‘She went over to the shed and coolly locked the top bolt and detained the defendant inside.

‘That deserves to be marked by a commendation from me and a reward of £250 for her public spirited and brave actions which have led to a repeat offender being imprisoned.’

In court, prosecutor Julian Kesner praised Mrs Gazzard’s ‘fortitude and clear thinking.’

‘When the defendant was interviewed he said he had no recollection of events at all due to his taking of illicit drugs,’ Mr Kesner said.

He told the court Marshall was on a 7pm-7am curfew at the time of the 3am burglary, following an appearance at Cheltenham Magistrates’ Court in April when he admitted two burglaries. He also had other previous burglary convictions.

Jon Holmes, defending, said: ‘He has a long history of drug abuse. On this night he had taken MKat (Mephedrone), which appears to be the drug of choice at the moment in the Forest of Dean.

‘He had injected it that night and has a consequence has very little recollection of the offence. He can only assume he did it because he wanted somewhere to sleep. It explains his odd behavour and his eating. ‘

Mr Holmes also praised Mrs Gazzard’s bravery, saying: ‘It takes some courage to go out at three in the morning and do what she did’.
