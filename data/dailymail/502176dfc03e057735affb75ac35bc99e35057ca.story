Eddie Gilfoyle speaking at press conference in 1992, the year his wife died

Police retained a secret diary that could have cleared a man jailed for life for killing his wife, it was revealed yesterday.

Eddie Gilfoyle protested his innocence for nearly two decades after being convicted in 1993 of murdering his pregnant wife, Paula, and making it look like suicide.

But it has emerged that a padlocked box existed containing two volumes of a diary covering ten years.

The journal reveals her troubled past and how she had previously tried to take her life.

These facts were not disclosed to Mr Gilfoyle's lawyers or told to the jury. In fact, the diary contradicts the image presented to the murder trial of Mrs Gilfoyle as a happy woman with everything to live for.

Police refused to say where the box had been over the years – because the case is being reviewed by the commission that investigates miscarriages of justice.

Mr Gilfoyle, 59, who was released in December 2010 after two unsuccessful appeals, said yesterday: 'I am completely devastated that the police had these diaries and failed to hand them over to my defence.

'I am disgusted, appalled, words just fail me. They should have been disclosed prior to my two appeals but they were kept hidden.

'I have told the truth all the way through. The police have lied all the way through.'

His solicitor Matt Foot, said: 'Mr Gilfoyle has protested his innocence for 19 years. Meanwhile the police have held on to a locked box containing material that directly contradicts their case. How has this happened?'

Mrs Gilfoyle, 32, who was 
eight-and-a-half months pregnant, was found hanged in the garage of the 
couple's home in Upton, Wirral, in 1992.

A suicide note was discovered in her 
handwriting but prosecutors said Gilfoyle dictated it to her, telling 
her he needed it for a course in his job as an auxiliary nurse.

Relatives and friends told the jury 
she was a happy, bubbly woman but the diaries and other personal papers 
which she kept in the marital home reveal she took an overdose of pills 
when she was 15.

They also show that as a teenager she
was engaged to a boy who was convicted of killing a girl. She bought 
him a wedding ring while he was in prison.

It was when that boyfriend, Mark 
Roberts, threatened to leave her that she took an overdose, writing in 
her diary: 'Mark went mad but I done it to him.'

The new evidence also revealed that 
two of Mrs Gilfoyle's former boyfriends threatened suicide and among her
possessions was a note from one – using similar words to the note found
where she died.

Mr Gilfoyle's lawyers have asked the 
Criminal Cases Review Commission to refer his case back to the Court of 
Appeal to be overturned.

Merseyside police confirmed they handed papers to Mr Foot last year but refused to comment further.

At trial, Gilfoyle suggested his wife’s teenage relationship with Mark Roberts could have affected her mentally.

Her friends maintain that after Roberts was jailed for killing a girl she didn’t want anything to do with him.

Her diary tells a different story:

May 26, 1974: ‘Went to golden goose. Went for a drink. Had our photos taken there.’

One time he threatened to leave her and she took an overdose: ‘Took some tablets 10 Mark went mad but I done it to him.’

September 30, 1976: ‘Mark rang me up. He has broken it off. Very upset just can’t believe he went with another girl.’

October 2, 1976: ‘Had to give a statement on Mark he has been charged with murder. Mum came to pick me up at his house nervous wreck.

November 19: ‘Went to court went in the cell with Mark. He gave me a love bite. He is sick but I love him.’

December 3: ‘Went to see Mark in court, Had hour and half with me lovely time. We kissed talked we are both in love. I want him and I need him.’

February 7, 1977: ‘Went to Crown court. Mark got sentenced for life, but I still love him. I shall try and keep my promise

On March 12 she bought him a silver wedding ring.

Two months later she collected his clothes he wore when he handed himself in: ‘Went to pick Mark clothes up at police station and got his wallet too, his belt and jeans had blood on.’

The box containing the fresh evidence – Paula Gilfoyle’s diary and other personal possession – was handed to Gilfoyle’s defence team in August 2010 by Merseyside Police.

On the box was an exhibit label from Lancashire constabulary, although it was the Merseyside force that investigated the murder.

Lancashire had been invited by the Police Complaints Authority in 1994 to review the investigation and took some exhibits.

Though it is unclear whether the box was discovered by Lancashire detectives during a search of Mrs Gilfoyle’s home during their 1994 inquiry or had ion fact been taken in the original investigation, but for whatever reason, subsequently forgotten about.

It was undisclosed throughout both Gilfoyle’s appeals in 1995 and 2000.

The CPS had drafted a deficient answer for the solicitor general Vera Baird about the disclosure of evidence in Gilfoyle’s trial.

In a statement, the CPS added: ‘Should there be any further queries or requests for clarification, the CPS will try to deal with them as quickly and comprehensively as possible.’

Two months later Gilfoyle’s solicitor Matt Foot was taken to Merseyside, when the box was produced by .

No explanation was given by Lancashire Police or the Independent Police Complaints Commission – which succeeded the PCA - as to why the box was only now being produced.

Gilfoyle was released from prison in 
2010 after spending 18 years behind bars. At the time his solicitor, 
Matt Foot, said there had been no forensic evidence for murder.

'The reason for that is that it was a
suicide,' he said. 'What the prosecution did was distort the evidence 
to give the appearance that there was forensic evidence in this case.'

Mr Foot claimed there were two 
'fallacies' in the murder case - that Mrs Gilfoyle would not have been 
able to keep her balance as she walked up the ladder to where she was 
hanged, and that she would not have been able to get the rope over the 
beam.

'These were complete and utter myths that were created by the prosecution and went into the trial,' he said.

It was an 'extraordinary coincidence'
that today's press conference came as the Law Commission had 
recommended changing the rules on expert evidence in jury trials.

'What they are saying is that there shouldn't be unjustifiable assumptions going into trials from experts,' Mr Foot said.

'And that's exactly what happened in 
this case, and if the new rules that are being suggested were in force 
in 1992 this case would never have gone to trial.'

The only marks found on Mrs Gilfoyle's body were two small scratched on her neck, above where the rope had been.

Experts say that these are occur in 
around 5 per cent of hanging suicides and are believed to be a result of
attempts to release the rope.
