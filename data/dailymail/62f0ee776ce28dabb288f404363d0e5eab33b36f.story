Separated from certain death only by a metal grill, a thrill-seeking pensioner comes face-to-face with one of the most dangerous creatures on earth.

Lowered into the water in a cage, danger-mad 73-year-old Janet Martyn, from Walthamstow, London, is a matter of inches away from three deadly, 12-foot long Nile crocodiles.

While brave Janet was getting her bearings in the water in the Cango Wildlife Ranch in South Africa, the animals began circling her, and would normally have been licking their lips at the prospect of a hearty meal.

Thrill-seeker: Janet Martyn, 73, goes cage diving with crocodiles in South Africa and, without the benefit of the shield, would probably have been eaten within seconds

Killers: Two of the three crocs to come face-to-face with Janet, named Hannibal and Marbaker, and begin to circle her

Predators: Nile crocodiles will eat almost anything and can spend days, weeks, or even months stalking their prey and waiting for the right moment to strike

But the crocs, named Hannibal, Marbaker and Sue, recognised Jan as a familiar face - and, instead of trying to take chunks out of her, began playfully nuzzling her cage.

Jan has been a volunteer at the centre, which is home to nearly 100 species, for seven years, and regularly gets dunked in the water to meet them.

The adrenaline-pumping act isn't for the faint-hearted, though, as Nile crocodiles are extremely dangerous.

Adrenaline junkie: Janet loves her work at the nature park, which is home to nearly 100 species

Brave: Janet, who has been volunteering at the Cango Wildlife Park for seven years, regularly dips in the water to confront one of the most dangerous animals on earth

Nerves: Despite being a dab hand at coming face to face with the crocs, Janet looks apprehensive as she prepares to dip in the water once more

Old friends: Despite their fearsome reputation, Janet has bonded with the crocodiles over the years and reaches out with a finger to give one of them a stroke

It is not uncommon for them to measure 20ft in length and weigh 900kg. It is an opportunistic apex predator and a very aggressive species of crocodile that is capable of taking almost any animal within its range.

Their diet consists mostly of different species of fish, reptiles, birds and mammals and it is an ambush predator able to wait for hours, days and even weeks for the suitable moment to attack.
