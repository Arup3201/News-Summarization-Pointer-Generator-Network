The leader of the young wing of the UK Independence Party has been fired after saying he backed gay marriage.

Olly Neville claims he was asked to stand down after being told his remarks were 'quite simply completely at odds' with the official party policy and put gains in opinion polls at risk.

UKIP insists Mr Neville was forced out after defying party policy on a range of subjects, including legalising drugs.

Former youth leader Olly Neville claims UKIP is on the 'wrong side of history' in opposing gay marriage

Mr Nevile was appointed as interim chairman of Young Independence (YI) at the end of last year but on January 2 backed gay marriage in an interview with BBC Radio4’s World at One.

UKIP opposes same-sex marriage, warning it would ‘risk the grave harm of undermining the rights of Churches and Faiths to decide for themselves who they will and will not marry’.

But after being ousted, Mr Nevile said: ‘On gay marriage the party is on the wrong side of public opinion and the wrong side of history.

‘It could be another burka ban issue for them, where they will look back ashamedly and wonder why we had that as a policy,’ he told The Independent.

UKIP Leader has opposed gay marriage plans fearing churches would be threatened will be forced by European courts to hold same-sex weddings

In an email UKIP chairman Stephen Crowther told Mr Neville yesterday: ‘The NEC [National Executive Committee] has resolved that you should not continue to act as interim chairman of YI, owing to the problems regarding party policy and public statements about which we have corresponded over the past week.’

Mr Crowther said the BBC Radio 4 interview was ‘politically inept’. The email said: ‘…your stated position on Gay Marriage is quite simply completely at odds with the Party's policy.

'Our policy on Gay Marriage is extremely important to us at this time.

‘We have said specifically and repeatedly that we are opposed to the government's proposals on this, and that the Prime Minister has got it spectacularly wrong.

‘For you to say precisely the opposite, on national radio, as the representative of YI, is absolutely unacceptable, and risks seriously setting back the party's current growth.’

However, today Mr Crowther insisted Mr Neville was ‘asked to stand down’ because he ‘did not fully appreciate the responsibilities attached to an official Party role’.

‘In relation to the Party's policies on areas including gay marriage, the European elections, the legalisation of drugs and prostitution among others, Mr Neville has been publicly at odds with the Party over the past few weeks,’ Mr Crowther added.
