Our pockets may be filled with devices that are designed to make our lives easier, but they can leave us in a tight spot when their batteries go dead.

Now there’s a belt that can recharge your gadgets while they are still safe in your pocket, so you'll never run out of power when you need it.

The leather XOO Belt looks distinctly normal and non high-tech, but its buckle incorporates a charger that is held in place by magnets so it can easily be connected and disconnected.

The XOO Belt can recharge your smartphone (pictured) and other electronic devices while they are still safety hidden away in your pocket, so you never run out of power when you need it

The belt, which comes in black and brown, can be charged up like an ordinary smartphone via a USB cable and has enough power to charge an iPhone 6 from scratch or 'pretty much any device' in around three hours. 

The cable is concealed behind the leather part of the belt, which itself contains a new type of flexible battery. 

A Manchester-based company called Nifty is raising funds on crowd funding website Indiegogo, to put the belt into production. It has already exceeded its goal of $50,000 with 18 days to go. 

‘The XOO Belt is a simple solution to an everyday problem - smartphone battery life,’ a spokesman at the company said.

The belt contains a 'new breed of Lithium Ceramic Polymer flexible battery', six layers of which are sandwiched between the leather part of the belt (pictured)

The belt contains a 'new breed of Lithium Ceramic Polymer flexible battery'.

There are six overlapping layers of this battery sandwiched between the belt leather to give a base power of 1,300mAh of charge.

'Add this to the 800mAh in each buckle—for a total of 2,100mAh—and you’ve enough to fully charge an iPhone 6 with some left over,' the company says.

The battery concealed in the belt is said to be 'completely invisible' and is non-reactive.

It takes around three hours to completely charge a phone, and the same amount of time for the battery pack to be charged up from a power source.

The buckle of the belt can be detached and charged up using a USB lead.

It is then reattached to the belt using magnets.

A micro-USB lead connected to the charging buckle is concealed behind the leather part of the belt.

To use it to charge a phone, a wearer flicks it down and plugs the end into a smartphone or another gadget of choice.

They can keep their phone in their pocket while it charges, with 'no complicated set-up or strange bulges' the company says.

‘It looks, feels and weighs about the same as a really nice belt but comes with a mighty 2,100mAh of hidden charge.

‘Other battery chargers exist but come with trade-offs - bulk, inconvenience or only a trickle of extra charge.

‘The XOO Belt does it all without such problems, it’s simple to use, always within reach and as light and stylish.’

The belt contains a 'new breed' of flexible battery, which its makers claim is the first of its kind in wearable technology. 

There are six overlapping layers of this Lithium Ceramic Polymer flexible battery sandwiched between the belt leather. 

The company also says that it is weather resistant and durable.

‘It’s made with full-grain leather, polished zinc buckles and an innovative ratchet mechanism,’ the spokesman said.

Nifty’s CEO, Piers Ridyard, explained that he came up with the idea for the belt because he was sick of his phone ‘dying by dinner time,’ which he described as ‘a first-world problem but, nonetheless, a really big pain’. 

The belt is available to pre-order from Indiegogo from $125 (£80).
