CLICK HERE to read Sportsmail Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel's appraisal of Liverpool's loss to Real Madrid at the Bernabeu

If it was an audition for a coaching job in Spanish football at some point in the future, then it was a case of 'don't call us, we'll call you' for Brendan Rodgers on Tuesday night against Real Madrid.

If there is one thing the Spanish dislike it's a coach who errs on the side of caution – they laud those who fight fire with fire and those who first and foremost try to make themselves hard to beat are looked down upon.

It's one of the reasons why former Liverpool coach Rafa Benitez has never quite enjoyed the unanimous approval of his countrymen, despite his trophy haul. 

'Poor image of Liverpool,' cries AS while Marca praises Real Madrid's 'Impecables' (faultless) on Wednesday

Some will have understood Rodgers' attempt at smothering Real's midfield passing game but Diario AS chief football writer Alfredo Relano spoke for the vast majority when he wrote: 'Giving up on the result from the moment of team selection was a crime against his club's history.'

Others compared the Liverpool coach to Granada boss Joaquin Caparros, who had said before last weekend's match against Madrid: 'All I ask for is that they don't walk all over us.' 

That seemed to be one of the motivations behind the team selection, although when respected El Pais journalist Santiago Segurola was asked about that comparison he said: 'Yes but that was Granada, this is Liverpool.'

In his daily editorial Relano added: 'It takes two to tango and yesterday Liverpool didn't want to dance. Even at the end when they brought on (Steven) Gerrard and (Raheem) Sterling. They were only one goal behind still didn't really go for it.'

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers didn't impress the Spanish media on Tuesday night against Real Madrid

Rodgers rested a number of key players, with captain Steven Gerrard joining the action from the bench

Rodgers was given 4.5 out of 10 in Marca's ratings. 'The Liverpool coach prioritised the Premier League,' said the Madrid sports newspaper, who ran the headline: 'Little more than a friendly' above its match report.

There is a phrase in Spanish football, 'Ganar sin despeinarse' ('Winning without messing your hair up'), that also featured in their coverage of a victory achieved with surprising ease.

Rodgers impressed everyone in Spain last season with Liverpool's title charge. The way he took the favourite English team of so many football fans in Spain to within touching distance of the title will have put him on the radars of most clubs.

Even Barcelona, whose current coach Luis Enrique has not covered himself in glory so far, will be monitoring his progress. But the reaction in Catalonia to Tuesday night's showing was equally lukewarm.

Mundo Deportivo journalist Orfeo Suarez says Rodgers' line-up was not 'behavior of a distinguished manager'

Prestigious Mundo Deportivo journalist Orfeo Suarez wrote: 'Dismissing the Champions League and dismissing the Bernabeu in such a way is not the behavior of a distinguished manager.'

Rodgers will have the last laugh if Liverpool beat Chelsea at the weekend, and qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League, where he will get another chance to impress outside of England.

If that chance does not come though, then the lasting memory in Spain of Rodgers this season will be of a man who brought the second best team in England last season to play the third best team in Spain last term, and never really gave them a game.
