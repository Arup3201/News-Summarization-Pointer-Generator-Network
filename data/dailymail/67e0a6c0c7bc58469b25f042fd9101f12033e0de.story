Arrested: Andrew Kurt Summers, pictured in his mug shot, allegedly made the death threats online

A man has been charged after threatening to shoot Mama June and her daughter Lauryn 'Pumpkin'.

Andrew Kurt Summers made the threats on June's Facebook page and has now been charged with making terroristic threats, police in McIntyre, Georgia told TMZ. 

Summer turned himself in on Monday and has been released on a $15,000 bail.

Honey Boo Boo and her family this week appeared to be putting their recent struggles behind them as they reunited to decorate the family home for the upcoming holiday.

With Sugar Bear newly returned to the family home, he and Mama June organized the over-the-top preparations for what will surely be an awkward Christmas.

Despite the seasonal display, it's hardly been a year to celebrate for Honey Boo Boo and her family.

First the child star saw her parents split up, then her mother reportedly reunited with a sex offender former lover - leading to the cancellation of the family's main bread winner - their reality show. 

As they decorated their home, June appeared to be putting on a brave face as she faces the risk of losing custody of her children pending an investigation by child protective services. 

Victim: Mama June, pictured, and one of her daughters were targeted by the death threats on Facebook

In October it emerged that she was dating convicted child molester Mark McDaniel.

Her ex-boyfriend served 10 years in prison for molesting an eight-year-old girl. June's oldest daughter Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, now aged 20, has said she was the victim.  

Anna was nowhere to be seen during the Christmas event. Instead she is reportedly busy seeking solicitations for herself - selling a potion that she claims can prevent Ebola.

Chickadee is shilling Ebola-blocking potions in her new role with the company Young Living Essential Oils.

The company's website described the curious claim of the tonic: 'The Ebola virus cannot survive in the presence of a therapeutic grade Cinnamon Bark and Oregano essential oil.'

Over the weekend the mother of two-year-old daughter Kaitlyn created a storm of comment on Facebook from fans of the series after she set up a GoFundMe page asking for $20,000.  

Left red-faced, she responded to the backlash [SIC]: 'I'm deleting my fund me cause everyone thinks I'm money hungry.'

Adding: 'And I have been think about everyone's opinions and I got alot of chooses and I have done there idea and I get the s*** end of the stick.'

She recently admitted that after her run on TLC's show, which began in 2012 and ended this year, she was left with only $17.90 in her trust fund account.

In November, the 20-year-old told E! News that she believed her 'selfish' mother squandered her earnings from show and accused the matriarch of purchasing a car for McDaniel, the man she accused of molesting her as a child.

'I have a feeling Mama used that money to buy a car or buy him what he wanted,' she told E! News.

June responded to the claims, saying, 'Not true. I have never brought a car for him and all her money is there, beside the money I have given her to live on—$400 every month and pay her $475 each month for cell phone bills for the last two years.

'That's the only money I have taken out of there.'
