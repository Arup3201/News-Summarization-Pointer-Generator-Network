It was supposed to be her acting comeback, a triumphant debut on stage in London's West End in the production of Speed The Plow. 

But sadly for Lindsay Lohan, things didn't exactly go to plan on her opening night on Wednesday. 

While not an unmitigated disaster, the 28-year-old actress didn't appear to know her lines off by heart, reading some from a book while being fed others from the side of stage.

And to makes matters worse, her one main passionate speech only succeeded in causing the audience to burst into laughter, according to onlookers.

A job well done! Lindsay lapped up the roaring applause from the audience at the conclusion of the play despite some unintentional laughter throughout

The three-act play, written by David Mamet, tells the story of two Hollywood hot shots, Bobbie Gould and Charlie Fox (Richard Schiff and Nigel Lindsay), who both attempt to bed their new secretary, Karen (Lohan).

While those in the audience agreed Lohan looked beautiful, reaction was decidedly mixed on her performance.

Nico Hines from The Daily Beast said: 'Lindsay Lohan only has one major speech in the David Mamet play that marks her West End debut. Unfortunately, she couldn’t remember how it went.

'On the first night of previews, a work-in-progress feel is to be expected. But halfway through the second act of Speed-the-Plow, the audience was openly laughing at Lohan’s struggle to grasp Mamet’s sharp, trademark dialogue.'

Bravo! At the end of the evening the Mean Girls star was gifted with a large bouquet of flowers for all her hard work 

Life
 imitating art... The script lifts the lid on the underbelly of 
Hollywood and was penned by Pulitzer Prize-winning screenwriter David 
Mamet

Chic: Lindsay looked stylish in a black suit and white shirt combo while her red locks were worn out

He said the audience sat patiently through the first prompt, but noted that her second 'led to titters' in the stalls.

He
 added: 'Unfortunately for Lohan, the next line delivered by Richard 
Schiff (Toby from The West Wing) was: "You have done a fantastic job!". 
The laughter grew louder.'

At one point, Mr Hines said a woman in the crowd moaned 'Oh my God, it's so embarrassing' during a set change.

She also 
caused unintentional hilarity with one particular section of her speech 
when the Hollywood bad girl, who has spent time in jail and rehab, said 
(in character as Karen), 'I know what it is to be bad, I’ve been bad.'

Entertaining plot: Lilo's character Karen is a secretary to a Hollywood executive who tries to manipulate her way to success

For me? Lindsay looked taken aback when an assistant ran up to hand her the beautiful blooms 

Jitters: According to some audience members on Twitter, the star forgot a few of her lines

Onlookers
 revealed this caused the entire theatre to burst into laughter, 
something which Lohan would not have been too pleased with.

Others were willing to cut Lohan a bit of slack on her first night.

One source told MailOnline: 'She was just fine, she did forget 
her lines a couple of times, but covered it up like a pro. She was a 
pleasant surprise for sure.

'Lindsay's
 character was quite interesting and she immersed herself in the role, 
she was very strong in the second scene which was her biggest one.'

Centre stage: But the jury is out on Lindsay's West End debut

A
 new chapter: 'I’m hoping it’ll take away attention from me as a 
celebrity name and draw attention to the fact that I’m an actress,' 
Lindsay told Time Out 

Knuckling down: 'I’m at a point when I want a diligent routine and I really want to get back into work'

The
 source added: 'She looked amazing... I was in awe of her. It was no 
means a perfect performance and she's certainly no Judi Dench, but she 
wasn't awful.

'There
 is a line where she says "I know what it is to be bad, I've been bad" 
and the audience all cracked up laughing but she got great applause in 
the curtain call and someone passed her flowers from audience.'

And
 Twitter reaction was decidedly mixed: 'User @toflee wrote: 'So Lindsay 
Lohan had her lines written down in a book & also got fed a line. 
Total car crash.'

Rehearsals:
 The actress has relocated to London for the role. 'Being here in London
 is all about me this time,' she told MailOnline 

Big shoes to fill: In 1988 Linday's character Karen was also portrayed by chart-topper Madonna

Good luck! The actress took to the stage in a white dress while sipping red wine

And ‏@rafayfay added: 'Major kudos to the woman who was feeding Lindsay Lohan her lines from offstage at #speedtheplow.'

‏@mizukawaseiwa
 tweeted: 'Oh my, and Richard Schiff! - @thedailybeast: London laughs at
 Lindsay Lohan's West End debut: http://trib.al/NdR3tLp .'

However,
 there were some positive reviews with ‏@SamuelCh writing, 'Loved love 
loved #speedtheplow !! @lindsaylohan was superb in the 3rd act! Such an 
amazing actress!!

He added: 'She was a bit nervous at the beginning but then totally nailed it!'

@officialkims
 took to Twitter to write 'and Congratulations @lindsaylohan opening 
night of #speedtheplow all the fear is really only one fear.'

Star turn: Lindsay appears in the David Mamet rerun alongside Richard Schiff (pictured) and Nigel Lindsay

Experienced: Richard is perhaps best known for his role as Toby Ziegler in political drama The West Wing

Side by side: The two co-stars act out a pivotal scene in Mamet's hit play

Line by line: The actress struggled in her new role at times during a night of mixed reviews for her West End debut

And
 fan account @LindsayLohanGua  tweeted: 'I'm going to cry!!!! OMG :) you
 deserve an everyday standing ovation @lindsaylohan xoxoxo repost from.'

And the Twitter reviews continued to roll in.

‘Lindsay
 Lohan needed line prompting 5 times, after the interval, but hiding 
behind 1st preview nerves is a great performance. #speedtheplow,’ one 
user remarked on Twitter.

‘@lindsaylohan laughing every time she forgot her lines was amazing. #speedtheplow #TheLindsayLohanPlay,’ added another.

Drinking in the applause: (L-R) Speed The Plow co-stars Nigel Lindsay, Lindsay Lohan and Richard Schiff

First night excitement! Lindsay Lohan cut a confident figure before taking to the stage for the opening of her new play Speed-The-Plow at the Playhouse Theatre in London on Wednesday evening

Luscious lips: The 28-year-old showed off a fuller-than-usual pout as she made her way into her West End debut

But
 many punters were impressed with Lilo's acting chops.

‘At the 
#speedtheplow intermission: @lindsaylohan looks beautiful and clearly 
belongs on the stage,’ one mused.

'@lindsaylohan #speedtheplow a-mazing,' agreed another. 

Earlier
 Lindsay arrived at the theatre with a paperback copy of the play in her
 hand and suspiciously plumped up lips ahead of her debut.

Nervous energy: On the morning before her performance, Lindsay had a chat about her play on Good Morning Britain

Promo time: Lindsay was joined by actor Nigel Lindsay as they were interviewed by pregnant Charlotte Hawkins
