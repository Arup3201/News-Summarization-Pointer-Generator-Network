Philadelphia sports fans have become infamous for their bad behavior, and it looks like it paid off for once.

After much public outrage from Philadelphia Flyers fans when their beloved Ice Girls cleaning crew were replaced by a group of men cleaning the rink between periods during home games earlier this year, the team brought back the ladies during tonight's home opener. 

Sadly, the team still didn't manage to win, going down 6 - 4 to the New Jersey Devils, to bring their season record to 0 - 2.

Coming back: After being absent so far this season, the Philadelphia Flyers brought back the Ice Girls cleaning crew (above) tonight - but in leggings instead of hot pants

Old look: The girls previously wore less clothing while cleaning

Fan unfavorites: Many were upset when they learned the Ice Girls had been replaced with an all-male cleaning squad (above) earlier this year

Also making fans upset was the fact that there are now only four Ice Girls, they get to wear sensible leggings rather than hot pants, and there are a lot more men cleaning the ice with them between periods.

Fans learned the Ice Girls were no longer when the Flyers took on the Toronto Maple Leafs at the Wells Fargo Center in their first pre-season game of the year, and a group of men, and not women, hit the ice to do some cleaning. 

Temporary leave: It is uncertain why the girls were not back for pre-season games earlier this year

The boos and jeers inside the stadium were deafening as these gentlemen, who, unlike their predecessors, got to wear pants and a fleece, went to work on the ice.

There is still no word yet on just why the Ice Girls were replaced, but one of the group's members, Erika Choi Smith, did break the news on her Twitter this August that they would not return to the rink. 

'No #FlyersIceGirls this year, but just wanted to say thanks to one of our biggest fans @FlyersNation & to all #Flyers Fans for being AWESOME,' she wrote.

Working hard: The four girls on the squad can be seen above, along with a few of the men 

The girls are back now though, taking to the ice every game wearing nothing but a midriff-baring top, those warm new leggings and their skates, still not the best outfit for a place where the temperature is around 50 degrees but better than those hot pants.

The Philadelphia Flyers also play an outdoor classic every year, where the temperature is about 20 degrees, so maybe they will get jackets at some point too. 

Strict rules: The girls used to wear hot pants when they worked on the ice

Mother Jones  wrote an article about the Ice Girls last year, and the all-female cleaning crew for another hockey team, the Los Angeles Kings, highlighting how little the girls were paid and the many strict rules they had to adhere too.

Among other things, the girls were not allowed to eat in public while wearing their costume and could not fraternize with any of the athletes, being told they should leave a bar or restaurant if they were out and one of the players came in.

This negative coverage could be why the Ice Girls were temporarily replaced by the new all-male cleaning crew.
