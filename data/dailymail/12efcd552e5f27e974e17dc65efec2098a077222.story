Aretha McAdoo, 43, from Platte County, Missouri, now faces up to a year in jail after being charged with child endangerment

A four-year-old girl overdosed on red wine after being left in the care of her social worker grandmother, authorities say.

Aretha McAdoo, 43, from Platte County, Missouri, now faces up to a year in jail after being charged with child endangerment. 

Her granddaughter was allegedly left alone with a box of wine and drank the lot, giving her a blood alcohol content of 0.159 - more than twice  the legal limit for adults.

McAdoo reportedly called emergency services when she returned to the kitchen and found her granddaughter passed out. 

She apparently didn't tell medics what the child had consumed.

However, responders realized what had happened after smelling alcohol in the girl's vomit.

The girl was taken to Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City where it is believed she made a full recovery.

Adam Algreen, a medical toxicologist at the facility, warned that the situation could have proved fatal.

Even a cup full of wine can be problematic to a small child.

'With increasing severity children get more sleepy and can actually go into coma and become unconscious and not breathe,' Algreen told Fox News.

The incident took place on December 16 and the case went to court this week.

McAdoo said she was mortified by what had happened.

Underfire: According to police, McAdoo appeared to have trouble balancing and was slurring her words when emergency services arrived

'This is an accident. My grandbaby got into something that I was drinking, which is wine,' she said. 

According to police, McAdoo appeared to have trouble balancing and was slurring her words when emergency services arrived. 

However, she insists she only had one glass of wine before leaving her grandchild alone with the remainder of the box.

She was looking two other grandchildren at the time. McAdoo said she regularly looked after the brood and every week they would visit her at home or they would go to the library.

It was not immediately clear if McAdoo has an attorney.
