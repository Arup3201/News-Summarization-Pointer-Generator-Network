A holidaymaker who left his motor in a near empty car park has been fined after he veered into a marked bay by the width of a tyre.

Peter Barr, from West Lothian, Scotland, broke the strict terms and conditions after marginally overshooting his space at a privately-run car park in Cornwall.

The 61-year-old was visiting the county for a few days with his wife when he decided to see Port Isaac, where the hit TV show Doc Martin is filmed.

Mr Barr bought a £3 ticket, went into the 
village and enjoyed walking around the TV set. But when he returned he 
was shocked to find he'd been fined.

He said: 'When I returned to the car park I found a Parking Notice Charge which said I was not wholly within the parking bay. I agree I was about eight inches outside the bay on the passenger side - I hadn't noticed.

'But the car park was less than five per cent full so I wasn't inconveniencing anyone and as this was late afternoon the car park wasn't going to get any fuller.

'Now I have been stung with a £100 fine for my being the two hand-widths out of line. This is absurd.

'I'm quite prepared to pay them £3 for parking in the "2nd bay" but they don't allow any right of appeal for anything other than exceptional circumstances. They basically write their own rules and laws!'

The car park is privately-run and enforcement is carried out by Newquay-based firm AS Parking

Enforcement of Port Isaac's car parking rules is carried out by a Newquay-based firm AS Parking.

Company manager Kevin McManus said: 'I have now reviewed this and can see that the notice was issued correctly as the vehicle was not parked within a single allocated bay.

'Terms & Conditions of use apply at all times and are non-negotiable, therefore the issuing officer was correct in issuing the notice.

'We have to issue notices for all contraventions, however minor they may appear to onlookers, in order to remain fair and consistent.

'Had we not issued a ticket in this instance and issued a ticket to a neighbouring vehicle for having no ticket (for example), the motorist could rightly complain that they were alienated as the neighbouring vehicle also failed to adhere to the T&C's.

'Having said the above, if a motorist appeals in cases such as this (i.e. minor contraventions) we always offer a concession as a gesture of good will; instructing them to ensure that they adhere to the rules in future.'
