New previously unseen photos have emerged of Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald's wedding day, including a snap of one of their very first kisses. 

The photos, obtained by Daily Mail Online from Ben's cousin, photographer Mark Kurowski, offer a unique glimpse into the ceremony, which took place on November 1 at the First Baptist Church in Bentonville, Arkansas; and captures the exchanging of vows, the newly married couple's exit from the church, as well as a post-wedding smooch.

Jessa, 22, and Ben, 19 - both stars of TLC's 19 Kids And Counting - famously waited until after the ceremony, which had an audience of almost 2,000 guests, to share their first kiss in private, before joining their family and friends at the reception.

Finally! Ben Seewald and Jessa Duggar famously waited until after the ceremony to share their first kiss in private, but hours later at the reception (pictured) they were happy to take things public

In one set of photos from the album, the blushing bride appears to preparing for the big moment with her father Jim Bob Duggar, 49, who would later walk her down the aisle. Jessa can be seen nervously arranging her veil in front of the mirror.

Other photos see the couple reading out their vows at the alter, clutching the paper on which they were written. According to People's report of the ceremony, Ben and Jessa wrote their own. 

The couple were flanked by a large cast of family members as bridesmaids and groomsmen.

As it happened: The ceremony took place November 1 at the First Baptist Church in Bentonville, Arkansas, and the big day was witnessed by more than 2,000 guests in total

Magic moment: The couple were flanked by a large cast of family members as bridesmaids and groomsmen, including Jessa's older sister Jill Duggar, pictured just behind Ben

Bridesmaids were decked out in matching orange dresses and clutched small color coordinated bouquets, while the groomsmen were decked out in gray shirts, suspenders and orange bow-ties. 

Jessa wore a $1598 pale blush gown from Tesori Bridal in Fayetteville, Arkansas, with a fully beaded bodice of Swarovski crystals and pearls. She'd had some of the tulle in the dress removed so it would fall exactly the way she wanted it to.

At one point during the ceremony, the couple, along with Jim Bob and two other members of the wedding party, can be seen gathered in an embrace, their heads bowed in prayer.

In another photo, Ben offers his new mother-in-law Michelle Duggar, 48, a restrained hug.

Jessa's sister Jinger, 20, acted as maid of honor, and the elegant reception - during which Ben and Jessa finally allowed themselves to be seen locking lips - was decked out with beautiful white roses and peach flowers. 

Pastor Mike Schadt later discussed the couple's decision to not kiss at the altar to the room full of friends and family.

Because no kiss was happening, he asked Jessa's parents to offer the crowd a kiss instead. 'So, now you've seen a Duggar kiss,' Schadt joked.

'They wanted their very first kiss ever to be in private. It was important to the both of them.'

After posing for photos, the newlyweds then attended their reception where they were cheered on. There was said to be no alcohol and no dancing, in accordance to the family's religious beliefs. 

One thing that was missing was a wedding cake. 'I don't really like it,' Jessa said. 

The two decided to go with ice cream sundaes instead. Toppings included chocolate, caramel, candy and cookies. Jessa had chocolate while her spouse enjoyed mint chip.

Ben and Jessa left the reception in a horse-drawn carriage as bubbles were blown into the air. 

Speaking of her modest  wedding dress, Jessa told People last year: 'It was the second dress I tried on. I love it.'

Tesori Bridal co-owners Lindsey Stavely and Erin Bridges added they didn't know if she would like it because it wasn't 'traditional white.' 

Ms Bridges then said, 'She kept coming back to this dress and all her sisters were like, "the second one, the second one," so everyone agreed.' 

Just so: Jessa had some of the tulle in the dress removed so it would fall exactly the way she wanted it to

All done! The couple leave the alter as man and wife to a ripple of applause from the front row of the audience

The evening before  the wedding, Ben and Jessa reportedly enjoyed a relaxed rehearsal dinner where they ate Frito pie followed by pumpkin pie and apple caramel streusel, and washed it down with iced tea.

'I'm so happy to have so many friends here from so many places,' Jessa apparently said during the evening.

'And I'm so grateful for my parents. Their influence has been so special to me. I look forward to a long, happy, marriage.'

Meanwhile Ben added: 'When I look at all the faces surrounding us tonight, I don't know how to thank all of you for investing in our lives, and in our life together. Y'all make us feel so special.' 

Jessa and Ben, whose one-year courtship was arranged by Jim Bob, got engaged on August 14, planning their wedding in just 11 weeks.

Smooch: Since their first kiss at the wedding, Jessa and Ben have evidently been practicing. Jessa posted this snap of the couple to Instagram in November, captioned, 'It's great living with your best friend'

During their courtship they were only allowed to hug from the side - and not have their chests touch, as the Duggar family believes the act would be too sensual.

Things moved on to hand-holding after Seewald popped the question.

At the time of their engagement, the couple said: 'God has written an amazing story through our courtship, and another chapter has just begun! We are thrilled to see what the future holds.' 

Since then, Jessa and Ben have been gushing over married life. 

They received their wedding photos on Christmas Day, with Jessa announcing on Instagram: 'Yay! We just received our entire wedding album. Perfect timing! So excited to share with friends and family over Christmas!'

Ben echoed: 'So happy to have just gotten all of our wedding pictures in! I'm SO blessed to be married to the Love of my life! God has greatly blessed me!'
