Do you have moles — those clusters of pigment that dot our arms, legs and face? According to Chinese astrology, their position on the face or body gives a useful insight into your personality, state of mind, future and health.

Armed with this knowledge, you can avert disaster and capitalise on success.

Simon Wong, an author and expert in Chinese astrology for 30 years, says mole analysis is often used in Chinese medicine.

A mole on the cheek like Marilyn Monroe's can represent potential accidents in later life

‘It helps build patients’ mental and physical profiles to aid diagnosis and treatment,’ he says.

Chinese astrologers believe changes in the body are caused by emotional or physiological responses to life events, so reading moles can give clues to ‘energy channels’.

‘Chi (energy) is more active in certain parts of the face and body at different times in a person’s life. Its flow can be emphasised or obstructed by the position of a healthy mole.’

A mole on the cheek suggests loneliness and being unable to settle down or form a family, although Eva Mendes has just announced the birth of her first child with Ryan Gosling

During our teenage years, moles increase in number; in pregnancy, they get darker; and they can disappear from the age of 40.

To help you understand what they can mean for you, here is Simon Wong’s guide to mole reading:

FOREHEAD

In the centre of the forehead, it means you aren’t communicating well with people in authority, such as your boss or parents. On the side of the head, it shows you have focus, drive and energy.

EYEBROWS

Under the eyebrow, it signals abundant wealth. When a mole is hidden from view, it is considered to be even more significant and special, like hidden treasure.

One above the eyebrow — like Angelina Jolie — represents a steady flow of money in your life.

EYELIDS

A mole on the eyelid symbolises disharmony within the family and a tendency to lose money.

‘Crying moles’ — those under the eyes — are a sign that you are overly emotional.

CHEEK

This suggests loneliness and being unable to settle down or form a family.

If it’s on or next to the crease of your face when you smile — like Marilyn Monroe and Michael Schumacher — it can represent potential accidents.

EARS

In Chinese astrology, ears represent your character, so a mole on the earlobes is a sign of a good personality and reputation.

One inside the ear means long life while one on the top of the ear symbolises intelligence.

If you have moles on both ears, you will be influential and enjoy a comfortable life.

A mole by the mouth, like Cindy Crawford's, suggests a person who enjoys good food and the finer things in life

NOSE

Be careful if you have a mole on the end of the nose: it represents instability as it’s in a precarious position. It means relationship problems ahead.

One on the bridge of the nose obstructs the flow of chi or energy as it flows downwards as we breathe, so symbolises entrapment or trouble ahead. It is also the sign of a hard worker because they labour to stabilise their energy flow.

Moles on the side of the nose, near the nostrils or hidden, indicates someone who is good with money, especially at protecting their bank account.

CHIN

Having a mole on the chin means tenacity, determination and stubbornness. It can lead to success or failure depending on how you direct this in your life.

It can also represent the need for change or travel (because the chin is always moving).

LIPS

The ‘food luck’ mole is found on the right or left corner of the upper lip. You enjoy good food, are generous and enjoy the finer things in life. A mole on the bottom lip means your children will be successful.

NECK

The neck forms a link between the head and body, or the ‘spirit’ and ‘physical’. A mole here obstructs the flow of energy and can mean disappointment. One in the centre of the neck represents a wild character who may cause their family grief.

ARM

Moles below the elbow show you are compassionate; those between the shoulder and elbow are a sign you get money easily.

CHEST

The chest symbolises power, so a mole here shows high status in society or your profession.

STOMACH

Mariah Carey's has a mole near her chin which means tenacity, determination and stubbornness

The navel is a treasure point in Chinese astrology, so the closer a mole is towards the centre of the stomach, the more auspicious you are or will be.

HANDS

This shows you are skilful, which could make you a lot of money.

BACK

This means you are carrying a burden. You will work hard in life, so success is possible. It just takes you longer to get there.

LEGS

One on the thigh represents sexuality and someone who is bold and extrovert.

On the calf, it relates to fitness problems, most likely from working too hard.

Those with moley knees — a lucky wealth spot — find it easy to make money.

BREAST

This signifies you are a nurturing mother and will have a powerful place in society because of it.

In Chinese astrology, the success of a mother’s children brings increased power and reputation. A mole on the nipple is a sign your children will do very well in their profession and more generally throughout their lives in love, luck and wealth.

FOOT

You have the ability to be a good leader if a mole is on your sole. Feet represent travelling or marching and people will be drawn to follow you. It can also signal that you will receive recognition for good deeds.

BOTTOM

This part of the body is linked to abundant food and wealth. A mole here signifies a good reputation, generosity and the inclination to help others.
