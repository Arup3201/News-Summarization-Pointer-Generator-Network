The estranged wife of celebrity chef Marco Pierre White yesterday admitted smashing up his Range Rover and daubing insulting graffiti in blood and red paint on his west London home.

Matilde Conejero, 47, used a child’s scooter to break the front and rear windscreens of the TV star’s top-of-the-range 4x4 vehicle, causing £12,000 of damage.

When he failed to answer his buzzer, the mother-of-three used her own blood and red nail varnish to scrawl insults on the walls of the communal hallway outside his front door.

Eventually, when a woman appeared at the door, Conejero ‘lurched’ at her in a jealous rage and had to be restrained by police.

Nicholas Alexander, prosecuting, told 
Isleworth Crown Court how Pierre White, 50, was asleep at his luxury 
home in Holland Park on May 7 when he was woken by a commotion outside.

Mr Alexander said: ‘He could hear noise coming from outside the property and went to the window to see what it was.

‘Whilst looking through the window he 
could see his wife by his Range Rover, smashing the vehicle and damaging
it using a child’s scooter. Extensive damage was caused to the 
vehicle.’

The court heard police were called and an officer arrived to find both windscreens had been damaged and the panels scratched.

Mr Alexander said: ‘As he approached 
the address he noticed the defendant had a bleeding little finger and he
noticed she was wearing red nail varnish.

‘As he approached the property he saw,
daubed in blood and red nail varnish, she had written graffiti 
offensive towards Mr Pierre White.’

Conejero, who the court heard has a 
previous conviction for drink driving, was arrested on suspicion of 
criminal damage and escorted from the premises towards an awaiting 
police van. She pleaded not guilty in a magistrates’ court, but changed 
her plea to guilty when the Crown Prosecution Service refused to drop 
the charges.

David Jubb, in mitigation, described 
Conejero as a woman of ‘impeccable character’ who had suffered since the
breakdown of her marriage.

He said: ‘They have been separated for some time and it has been an emotional and distressing period of time for this woman.’

Judge Philip Matthews adjourned sentencing until later this month, but indicated Conejero did not face custody.
