More than 35million people are now living in the drought zone which is engulfing England.

Another 17 counties in the South West and the Midlands will be officially designated as 'water-stressed' today - the largest area suffering a water shortage since 1976.

Although the hosepipe ban currently in force for 20million people has not yet been extended, contingency plans are being drawn up as the Environment Agency confirmed the drought is likely to last until Christmas.

Worst water shortage since 1976: The half-full Bewl reservoir is holding just 50 per cent of its capacity as opposed to the 90 per cent it would normally hold at this time of year

Officials fear that a third dry winter could see a return to water rationing like that seen in 1976, when South West England didn't see rain for 45 days.

During the drought, several large rivers, including the River Don, ran completely dry and food prices increased following the loss of £500million worth of crops.

There were also large scale fires that affected moorland across the country and burnt around 50,000 trees.

Denis Howell was appointed the Minister for Drought and the Drought Act was passed making water rationing and standpipes commonplace.

Officials are concerned that a third 
dry winter this year could be a tipping point and trigger restrictions 
for businesses or even further restrictions in homes for the first time 
in 36 years.

The restrictions are embarrassing for 
the Government which is showcasing Britain during this year's Olympics 
and the Queen's Jubilee. 

Parks are included in the hosepipe ban and London’s iconic fountains will be turned off.

The River Severn - Britain’s longest 
river - may completely dry up in places by the summer, with disastrous 
consequences for plants, wildlife and fish stocks.

A section near Ironbridge in 
Shropshire is already causing concern - just 50 miles from Tewkesbury in
Gloucestershire where the Severn burst its banks, deluging dozens of 
homes back in 2007.

Despite the poor outlook, the Severn Trent water company, which serves eight million customers, has no plans for a hosepipe ban due to operating an 
internal ‘water grid’ to move water from the wetter west of the region 
to the drier east.

The drought zone now includes 
Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Bristol, Gloucestershire, some of 
Hampshire and Wiltshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Derbyshire, 
Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Shropshire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire 
and the West Midlands.

And yesterday it emerged communities 
are pulling out of the Britain in Bloom contest - a source of civic 
pride for around 2,000 towns and villages every year.

Thousands of bulbs which have been 
ordered and paid for by local committees may not even be planted due to 
the arid conditions, which are already taking their tolls on farmers and
the environment.

Local councils are said to be holding 
crisis talks with the Environment Agency and water companies to devise 
ways to irrigate public flowerbeds and hanging baskets - which is 
normally carried out by volunteers.

North Norfolk District Council – in 
one of the worst-hit drought areas - is facing the prospect of planting 
30,000 flowers in June which cannot be cancelled even though campaigners
warn they will wither and die.

Joan Thame, chairman of the In Bloom 
committee in Sheringham, Norfolk say they have already abandoned plans 
for colourful baskets this year as they cannot be filled using water 
bowsers filled from the mains.

Bulpham in Bloom in East Anglia which 
won a silver gilt award at Royal Horticulture Society finals in 2010, 
and gold two years running for Anglia in Bloom, is considering pulling 
out altogether.

How things stand: More than 17 counties in the South West and the Midlands, affecting more than 35million people, are now officially designated as 'water-stressed'

Several towns including Horsham in 
West Sussex, are reducing their hanging baskets, while in Colchester, 
Essex, the situation is so desperate, the group has appealed for 
residents to donate water.

Swindon Council which ordered £10,000 
worth of bedding plants, has decided not to plant them, and is hoping to
sell or swap them for drought resistant varieties.

The drought zone now includes 
Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Bristol, Gloucestershire, some of 
Hampshire and Wiltshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Derbyshire, 
Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Shropshire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire 
and the West Midlands.

In March, the Environment Agency 
rescued fish from the River Lathkill in Derbyshire after it dried up, 
and the Rivers Tern, Sow, Soar and Leadon reached their lowest ever 
recorded levels.

In the South West, chalk streams such 
as the Hampshire Avon and the Dorset Stour which support rare trout and 
salmon are exceptionally low.

The drought comes after two years of 
chronically low rainfall. From October and March – known as the winter 
recharge period when reservoirs fill up – parts of England received less
than 60 per cent of the average winter rainfall.

Trevor Bishop, Head of Water Resources
at the Environment Agency, said:  ‘A longer term drought, lasting until
Christmas and perhaps beyond, now looks more likely – and we are 
working with businesses, farmers and water companies to plan ahead to 
meet the challenges of a continued drought.

‘While we’ve had some welcome rain 
recently, the problem has not gone away, and we would urge everyone – 
right across the country – to use water wisely now, which will help to 
prevent more serious impacts next year.’

The Environment Agency last week 
called on businesses to save water through efficiency and fixing leaks. 
Water companies to address leaks which lose enough water for 20million 
people a day.

Martin Spray, chief executive of the 
Wetland Wildlife Trust at Slimbridge in Gloucestershire, which is now in
drought, said the lack of water would have consequences for the rare 
wading birds at their site who rely on wet, muddy grassland for their 
habitats and to feed their chicks.

He said: ‘We’ve concentrated water 
where it is most effective and made the most of every drop, but even so 
the effects are starting to bite.

‘We want people to make the connection
between the water they use in their homes and gardens and the amount 
and quality of water for wildlife.'
