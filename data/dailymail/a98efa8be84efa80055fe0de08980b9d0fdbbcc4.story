Florence Frost, 88, pictured with husband Victor, 90, was sent away from A&E at Queen's Hospital, Romford, despite having a broken neck and spine

Doctors sent home a grandmother who broke her neck and back in a fall in her garden telling her to take painkillers.

Florence Frost, 88, went to the A&E department at Queen's Hospital, Romford, after the accident at her home in Dagenham, Essex, which lefter in agony and barely able to move.

Her husband Victor Frost, 90, and daughter, Lynne Reynolds, 55, demanded that Mrs Frost be X-rayed, but medics insisted she was just 'badly bruised' and sent the elderly woman home.

Two days later the frail pensioner was rushed back to the hospital after her condition deteriorated.

She has now been told that she will have to lie, immobile, on a ward for six to eight weeks to limit the damage she's already suffered.

Today her daughter spoke of her anger and fear that the original blunder by doctors could leave her mother in pain for the rest of her life.

Mrs Reynolds, whose parents live with her and her family in Dagenham, said: 'One false move could have left her paralysed.

'My son and I helped her into bed and to move when she was at home - and we could have done more damage to her as we thought it was just a bruised neck.

'We didn't have a clue it was broken.'

She said her distressed mother is 'in a very confused state', adding: 'Mum is constantly crying all day and she more or less can't move an inch.  She's just lying in bed.'

Mrs Reynolds added: 'It's very upsetting for me and my dad, who is 90 years old.  They're treating her well in the ward, but when she went to A&E they just sent her home.

'To treat an 88-year-old woman like that is absolutely disgusting.'

Angry: Mrs Frost's daughter, Lynne Reynolds, 55, and husband asked A&E staff to X-ray her but claim they were refused. She has complained to the hospital trust

She has 
now complained to Dagenham and Rainham MP Jon Cruddas about the 
treatment her mother received at A&E and is also writing to the 
£200m flagship hospital to make a formal complaint.

A
 Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals spokesman said: 
'We have not had any contact from Mrs Frost or her family regarding her 
care.

'We
 take patient safety extremely seriously, so we would always encourage 
patients to contact us to discuss any concerns they might have so we can
 then investigate them.'
