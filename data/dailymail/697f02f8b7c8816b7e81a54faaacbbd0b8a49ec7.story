Her day job is a million miles away from the glamour of the fashion world, but scrap yard worker Kelly Rowland is hoping to make it on the world's catwalks.

The 24-year-old, from Wales, plans to quit her job in a bid to become Miss Universe.

Kelly swaps her daytime dirty overalls for tiaras and ballgowns in the evenings, and has already been crowned Miss Carmarthenshire and was a runner up in the Miss Wales competition.

'I just enjoy the excuse to get on stage and wear a pretty dress.'

At night, she swaps noise and smells of the junk yard for ball gowns and pageants

But she hasn't quit her job working in the office at Ammanford Metals just yet.
