Enjoying a horse-drawn ride along the snow and skiing together in the children's park, the Danish royal family are clearly enjoying a break from their busy schedule on their family ski holiday in Col-de-Bretaye near Villars-sur-Ollon, Switzerland.

Prince Joachim of Denmark, 45, and Princess Marie, 39, were joined by their children Prince Henrik, and Princess Athena, as well as Joachim's children from his first marriage, Princes  Felix and  Nikolai.

As well as posing for a photoshoot, the family let their hair down and enjoyed the resort's winter wonderland.

French-born Marie, who married Joachim in 2008, looked radiant in a grey turtle neck, black salopettes and a stylish pair of designer sunglasses.

She was seen helping little Princess Athena learn to ski in the children's snow park and looked happy and relaxed with her husband as the pair linked arms and navigated the slopes.

Princess Marie  and Prince Joachim of Denmark, who met in 2007 and have two children together, proved they're still very much in love on the ski trip

The couple met in 2007 and have two children together, His Highness Prince Henrik Carl Joachim Alain (born in May 2009) and Her Highness Princess Athena Marguerite Françoise Marie (born in January 2012).

Marie is also stepmother to Prince Joachim's two sons from his first marriage to Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg.

Prince Joachim, the second son of Margrethe and Prince Consort Henrik, is himself sixth in line to the throne after his elder brother Crown Prince Frederik and his four children with Australian-born Crown Princess Mary.

Joachim's brother and the heir to the Danish throne, Crown Prince Frederik - also a father-of-four - is also enjoying a ski break in Verbier with his own family this week.

Its is their second trip to Verbier in as many years - the royals all decamped to the resort last year in exactly the same week for some fresh mountain air and a week's skiing. 

The family will have enjoyed a quiet few days on their own after a busy Christmas that saw them celebrate with the Greek royal family.  

Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, her two children and their families joined Princess Benedikte and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece and their families at Fredensborg Palace on the Danish island of Zealand.
