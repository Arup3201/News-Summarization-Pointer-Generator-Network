Watching her pout over a hot stove, viewers have grown used to seeing Nigella Lawson's plump lips dressed with a touch of rouge.

But after losing the red lipstick for a more natural look, it appears the 54-year-old TV chef may have sparked a trend - with sales of nude lipsticks rising by 62 per cent.

According to high street chain Debenhams, nude and sheer lipsticks have been outselling bright reds and hot pinks for the first time in three years.

Change: The TV chef was famed for her love of pillar box red lipstick but has since swapped it for a nude shade

The natural trend - which has been mirrored across fashion catwalks - also appears to have been favoured by Hollywood's leading ladies.

Arriving on the red carpet of last weekend's Oscar Awards Ceremony Julia Roberts and Cate Blanchet who ditched their usual crimson lips for a nude look.

However retail experts yesterday claimed it is not celebrity trend setters fuelling the rise in sales but instead a theory dubbed the 'lipstick index'.

Economists believe sales of bright red lippy will rise during economic recession and therefore fall during an upturn.

EstÃ©e Lauder chairman, Leonard Lauder, coined theory in 2001 although the effect was first noted in the 1930s Depression.

Speaking about the rising sales figures post-recession, health and beauty director for Debenhams, Sara Stern said: 'The trend for sheer, nude lips and more natural make-up was first highlighted on the spring, summer 2014 catwalks and has been seen on countless celebrities ever since.

The glamorous chef, who used to write for Vogue, has a history of sparking style trends in both fashion and cooking.

Her penchant for Donna Karan's figure-hugging dresses led to high street stores stocking similar garments, and a spike in the designer's sales.

In January, it emerged the blue Midhurst dress by Diva Catwalk that Nigella wore in The Taste sold out within days of the advert hitting screens. 

And retailers such as Waitrose have dubbed her the reason for an upturn in home-baking during the summer months - it is normally a winter activity.

'The Oscars saw a large number of stars wearing neutral make up, and the same can be said for our popular and favourite TV personalities.

'Even reality star Kim Kardashian has recently undergone a make-under, transitioning from bright red lipstick and heavy application, towards a softer more relaxed appearance I like to call naked make-up.

'This look creates an illusion of being make-up free but with full coverage, perfect for summer.'

Today an estimated 81 per cent of women worldwide wear lipstick, with best nude sellers including Rouge Dior Nude, Clinique's Twilight Nude and Urban Decay's Naked.

But despite the move to a more natural look, red lipstick look is still a firm favourite among a host of stars such as actresses Scarlett Johansson and Anne Hathaway.

The iconic scarlet look was also always worn by Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor.

Even Elizabeth I used beeswax and plant extracts to create crimson lips.

But in 1770 parliament made lipstick illegal, ruling women found guilty of 'seducing men into matrimony using cosmetic means' could be tried for witchcraft.

Queen Victoria also found lipstick vulgar, but it was popularised by silent movie actresses in the early twentieth century.

The first modern swivel lipstick tube was patented in 1923 and companies such as Chanel, Helena Rubenstein, and Max Factor soon ensured almost every woman had one in their handbag.
