Two men in Louisiana got into a heated argument with a police officer last week after berating him for littering on public property.

A cell phone video of the confrontation between Marcus Smith, his friend Randall Garrett and Chester Officer Lee Williams was posted on YouTube last Thursday, drawing more than 150,000 views.

The 8-minute video, recorded by Garrett in the passenger’s seat in the parking lot of a grocery store in Ferriday, Louisiana, begins with the driver flagging down Officer Smith as he is walking from his patrol car.

Heated exchange: Marcus Smith, his friend Randall Garrett and Chester Officer Lee Williams (pictured) got into a heated argument over littering outside a grocery store in Ferriday, Louisiana, last Thursday 

'I saw your passenger roll down the window and throw out a piece of candy wrapper on the road back there, and I just wanted to let you know that's not right,' Marcus Smith tells Williams.

'Let me tell you what you do. You worry about you,' the officer dressed in a police jacket says in reply.

Smith then points out to Williams that littering is against the law, and that as a police officer it is his duty to uphold the law.

Williams appears unfazed by the pointed remark, telling the motorist: 'Well, go do something about it.'

He goes on: ‘I tell you what you do, you pull this vehicle off and get out of my face,’ Williams says. ‘Go write me a ticket.’

When Smith and his companion inform the cop that they had reported him to dispatch, Williams replies that it does not matter.

Not happy: Officer Williams was evidently upset when Smith (left) flagged him down and berated him for throwing a candy wrapper out the window of his patrol car 

Not impressed: The officer was unfazed when Smith told him that as a cop, it is his duty to uphold the law 

The trio continue bickering for several more minutes, with the officer growing increasingly angry at the two men for stopping him in his tracks over a candy wrapper chucked out the window of his patrol car on Highway 245.

At one point, Williams tries to turn the tables on the pair, saying that he was nice enough not to stop him on the highway, even though they were doing 65mph in a 45mph zone, but Garrett quickly points out that the cop was driving at the same rate of speed.

‘What you missed is you need to grow up, learn the law, then maybe you can say something,’ says Williams

Towards the end of the video, Garrett inquires of Williams how long he has been on the force.

'It ain't your f***ing business,' he rudely replies.

War of words: After bickering for several minutes, Williams told Smith: 'You go file your complaint, boy'

The verbal spat ends with William challenging Smith: 'You go file your complaint, boy.'

Since the cell phone recording was posted online, other allegations have emerged against Officer Williams.

An investigation into the cop’s employment history by a local news station has revealed that he had been fired from the Lake Providence Police Department for disciplinary reasons.

Ferriday Police Chief Derrick Freeman told KNOE that he will 'handle the situation.'
