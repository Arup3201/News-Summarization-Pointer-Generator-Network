Super-sized graves dedicated solely for obese people are set to be installed at a cemetery amid fears of a growing ‘obesity crisis’ – and they will be near the road so the undertakers don’t have far to carry the body.

Plans for 30 super-sized plots have been drawn up by council workers after larger graves were requested by funeral directors who have been struggling to haul coffins over long distances in Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire.

Sutton Bridge and Wingland Parish Council hopes to open a new three-acre burial ground next year because space is running out at the cemetery in the local church - where plots measure 9ft by 4ft.

As well as hundreds of standard graves, the authority plan to dig extra wide 9ft by 8ft plots near to the entrance of the burial ground.

Parish councillor Vicky Hills - who is leading the project - said the need for larger plots was ‘the result of people not being responsible for their weight’.

She said: ‘I think in today’s climate obesity is becoming more of a problem. They will cost more money because we are going to have double plots.

‘It’s the result of people not being responsible for their weight, basically.

‘It was requested by the funeral directors that they should not be too far from the road so they don’t have too far to carry them.

‘If you can imagine you’ve got your coffin as well, then you’ve got your body. It’s totally dead weight, to coin a pun.’

The new 
burial ground will last for 100 years and will be situated a mile away 
from the current cemetery at St Matthew’s Church in Sutton Bridge.

The
 parish council expects the cost of the new facility to cost over 
£200,000 and is due to submit a planning application to South Holland 
District Council.

Plans have been drawn up for 30 super-size plots which will be situated near to the road (indicated by the red box) in a new cemetery in Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire

While a standard casket typically measures between 24 and 27 inches wide, manufacturers are now producing boxes as wide as 52 inches, capable of fitting a person weighing up to 1,000 pounds

It is not yet known how much the extra large graves will cost themselves - but it is expected to run into thousands of pounds.

Councillor Hills said the price to bury loved ones at the site had not yet been determined but admitted the larger plots would cost more than standard ones.

She said: ‘We are just waiting for the detailed drawings and then we will be submitted it to the council for planning.

‘It is likely to cost more. It is like aeroplane seats, they are all starting to charge more for obese people now.’

It is not the first council to announce plans to extend graves for larger bodies. In November last year, Rochford Council in Essex said it would be increasing the size of graves in the area to accomdoate obese people.

However, Sutton Bridge and Wingland is believed to be the first authority to dedicate an area of a cemetery completely to overweight corpses.

Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, described the move as ‘sensible’ but expressed concerns that the separate plots could be likened to paupers’ graves and upset grieving relatives.

He said: ‘Having a dedicated area sounds like the council will be making the best use of the space available to them so in that sense it sounds quite sensible.

‘But I am concerned there might by a stigmatisation attached to people having to arrive at cemetery to ask “so where are the fat people buried?"’

‘It’s like the old paupers graves, there are some relatives that might be embarrassed to be seen there while trying to cherish the memories of their departed.

‘But the true tragedy is that these are ever needed in the first place.

‘The Department of Health will try and have you believe that obesity levels are falling but there’s no doubt that the fat are getting fatter.

‘It is a disastrous thing that we are even seeing crematoriums and cemeteries being forced to expand to accommodate larger bodies in wider and wider coffins.

‘But I still do worry for the people who go to mourn who may feel polarised by these separate graves in a different part of cemetery away from others.’

The decision comes after it emerged school children in Lincolnshire are among the worst in the country for childhood obesity.

Rochford Council in Essex is another authority which is digging larger graves in its cemeteries to accommodate bigger bodies

Obesity is forcing ambulance bosses to revamp their fleets to cope with obese patients including East Midlands Ambulance Service which has introduced a fleet of 128 larger ambulances, each capable of dealing with patients who weigh up to 55st

Figures reveal the 20 per cent of Year 6 pupils - aged 10 to 11 - were classed as obese, compared to 18 per cent for England and 17 per cent for East Midlands.

In December last year Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council, Staffordshire, installed a new £12,000 lift table to handle wider coffins for obese people.

The authority said the decision came after Bradwell Crematorium was unable to accommodate the funerals of 15 overweight people in 2013.

Some funeral parlours in Britain have even had to install hoists capable of lifting 50 stone, purchase reinforced steel trollies and increase the size of their fridges in order to manage larger corpse.

Hospital morgues and crematoriums have already had to make alterations to deal with the changes, such as installing extra-large furnace.

And ambulance bosses have also started paying out millions to ‘supersize’ their vehicles to cope with the growing number of obese casualties.

The East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) introduced a fleet of 128 larger ambulances, each capable of dealing with patients who weigh up to 55st.
