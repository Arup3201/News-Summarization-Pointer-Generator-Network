A political earthquake rocked the Kremlin last night as exit polls showed Vladimir Putin’s most charismatic foe making a sensational showing in Moscow’s mayoral elections.  

Anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny scored around one third of the vote against the incumbent in exit polls, a result far in excess of expectations.  

Bland technocrat Sergei Sobyanin, a leading Putin acolyte, appeared to be edging towards victory in the first round but only by a whisker.

And Navalny’s team claimed Sobyanin had failed to clear the 50 per cent threshold for first round victory and that a run-off should be held.  

Although far short of victory, it is a remarkable showing in the context of Russian elections - and gives huge hope to the opposition for the years ahead.

Navalny made his name as a campaigner against alleged vote-rigging by Putin’s United Russia Party in recent elections, and has led street demonstrations against the ruling elite.

He has made clear he wants to jail Putin and his henchmen for alleged corruption.

Sobyanin, backed by the vast state apparatus, had been expected to trounce the 37 year old lawyer and blogger who faces a five year jail sentence on what he deems politically-motivated charges linked to a business deal.

But the polls suggest one of the most extraordinary election results since the fall of the Soviet Union.

They are due to hold a rally tonight to protest the result. 

Kremlin appointee Sobyanin scored 52.5 percent of the vote while Navalny achieved 29.1 percent, according to state-backed FOM polling group.

Another polling group put Sobyanin on 53 per cent and Navalny 32 per cent. The margin or error is three per cent. 

Navalny’s aides claimed he had scored 35.6 per cent, against 46 per cent for Sobyanin, a result which would mean a run-off. 

The official count will go ahead today.

Our exit poll data undeniably show that there will be a second round of this election,’ said Navalny.

Even a state-funded news agency dubbed Navalny’s performance as ‘staggering’.
