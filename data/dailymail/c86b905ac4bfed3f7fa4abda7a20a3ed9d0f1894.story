It's a major decision that most parents will agonise and fret over; what to name your newborn child.

But one 'crazy' father has decided to allow the internet to name his daughter - although with a few vital conditions.

Stephen McLaughlin set up the website NameMyDaughter.com and invited internet users on the online message board Reddit to submit whatever first and middle names they like.

Running total: The fate of Stephen McLaughlin's daughter rests with internet users, who so far are favouring Amelia Mae McLaughlin

The names with the most votes when the baby, who is due on April 2, is born will end up on the birth certificate.

Among the list of front-running givennames are Cthulhu, Laquisha, Megatron, Slagathor and Leslie.

The submissions for middle names are just as eclectic, with All-Spark, Le-Dash-A, Pond, Salad and Titanium all still in with a shout of topping the poll.Â 

However,
 to convince his wife to allow him to handover such an important 
decision to a world of strangers, Mr McLaughlin said he will have 
ultimate veto over what is chosen.

Decisions: Stephen McLaughlin is allowing internet users can suggest and then vote on names for his daughter

Mr McLaughlin wrote on his site: 'Hi, 
My name is Stephen and much to the disbelief of my wife, I have decided 
to let the internet name* my daughter.

'Yeah
 that is an asterisk, Unfortunately internet I know better than to trust
 you. We will ultimately be making the final decision, Alas my daughter 
shall not be named WackyTaco692. Sorry guys the wife wouldn't go for a 
free for all.

What's in a name: A father has decided to allow internet users to chose his daughter's first and middle names

'You can vote once for as many names as you want. Don't forget to checkout all of the first , middle or even both names for more options.

'Inappropriate submissions may be removed -- Yeah looking at you Graeme. You know what you did.'

He has already had to remove a host of inappropriate names, including a host of sexually transmitted diseases and erotic positions.

He said: 'So far I have only had to moderate several STIs and a couple of sexual positions... I would prefer not to have to remove anything from the list.'

Mr McLaughlin added: 'I am also quite surprised by how respectful people have been.'

The current leading contender is a surprisingly normal-souding Amelia Mae McLaughlin.

But it seems some hackers have already tried to rig the vote.

Mr McLaughlin updated his site saying that '1700 votes for CTHULHU with no IP address, I think someone found a loop hole, Oh well closed that'.
