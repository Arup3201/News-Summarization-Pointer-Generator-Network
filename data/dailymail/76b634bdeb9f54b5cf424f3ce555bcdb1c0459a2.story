She's been enjoying the sun, sea and scandal during the TOWIE casts' annual pilgrimage to Marbella but it's straight back to the day job for Danielle Armstrong.

The blonde reality TV star, who works as a stylist for In Love With Fashion, has selected - and modelled - her edit of summer styles for the fashion brand.

The clothing company, which Danielle has worked with for eight years, describe her as 'flirty, feminine and oh-so-fun' and say she's the perfect person to edit their summer range of dresses and jumpsuits.

Summer's coming! Danielle Armstrong, of TOWIE fame, has created an edit of her favourite summer dresses for the fashion brand she works for, In Love With Fashion (dress, £32)

The Danni Day collection, as it is called, promises to combine the 'prettiest prints with the cutest cuts to create an aesthetic that will see you through the day in the trendiest way', say the brand.

Danielle, 26, has selected peachy two-pieces, statement jumpsuits, tropical bodycons and Grecian-inspired fringed maxi dresses, all modelled by the star herself.

Hot pink! Danielle, 26, has worked with In Love With Fashion as a stylist for eight years and now she's edited her own range of summer picks (playsuit, £34)

All things bright and beautiful: Danielle models her favourite summer statement pieces for the fashion brand, including this vibrant orange jumpsuit, £45, and yellow playsuit, £34

Festival fabulous: Danielle's collection is full of fringed and floral maxi dresses that would be perfect for the beach club or Glastonbury (£48)

Clearly thrilled to launch her edit, the blonde stylist took to Twitter to share the good news.

She wrote: 'Really excited about my new collection with @ILWF_LOVE check out the beautiful dresses here ladies.'

Speaking to MailOnline about her summer style tips, she said: 'My summer must-have is definitely tan wedges, I wear them with everything. Especially playsuits. I can't stand seeing people wearing playsuits with flats, it's key to wear big chunky wedges to really elongate and flatter the legs.

'Typical Essex thing here, but always wear fake tan, everything looks so much better when you have a glow. My favourite brand is Fake Bake.'

Just last week, The Only Way Is Essex star was flaunting her toned body in Marbella with the rest of of Romford pals with all the dramas airing on ITV2 last night.

Sharing her tips for looking poolside glam, she said: 'It's all about stand-out bikini's and kaftans. All the pieces I wore in Marbs were embellished, fringed or neon colours.'

Speaking about her style icon, she said: 'I think it's really important to style yourself on someone that has a similar body shape. I have curves, bum and booty so I always admire Kim Kardashian. She knows exactly who to dress for her figure and never gets its wrong.

'I have also always loved Victoria Beckham! She can pull anything off and always looks fantastic.'

Aside from filming for TOWIE, Danielle has been concentrating on her collection and working on the next drop for AW14, which, she says, is going to be 'pretty special'.

She added: 'I am also launching a boutique in my hometown Essex, which opens the end of July. In five years time I'd love to be settled, maybe married.

'I hope my boutique is a huge success and could eventually be a chain of shops, that would be exciting.

'Fashion has always been my main passion so I would hope to use my skills in the industry, maybe even fashion presenting.'
