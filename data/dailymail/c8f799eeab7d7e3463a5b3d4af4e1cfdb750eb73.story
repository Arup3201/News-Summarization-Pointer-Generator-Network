Allegations: Ali Dizaei, pictured today, was reinstated to his job at the Met Police but was then immediately suspended

A controversial police chief awaiting trial for alleged corruption could receive up to £180,000 in back pay after being dramatically reinstated at Scotland Yard.

Ali Dizaei, 49, was sacked from his £110,000 a year commander’s job in the Metropolitan Police after he was jailed last year for misconduct and perverting the course of justice.

But his convictions were overturned  in May and on the orders of three Appeal Court judges, he will now face a re-trial  in January.

Since winning the new trial, Mr Dizaei has insisted he should be treated as an innocent person and given his job back at the Met. The Police Appeals Tribunal ruled on Wednesday that he should be reinstated.

But last night the Iranian-born policeman was suspended on full pay by the Metropolitan Police Authority.

According to insiders, Mr Dizaei is likely to be entitled to back pay for his 18 months off the Scotland Yard payroll. This could be worth up to £180,000 with allowances.

Mr Dizaei said today he would appeal against his suspension.

'Yes I am, I think out of principle,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

'I think your ordinary citizen will say a person is being paid a pay package he should earn and work for that money.

'There are plenty of jobs I could be doing to earn the money I am being paid without interfering with frontline policing.'

He accused long-standing members of the MPA of being suspicious of non-white officers in senior positions at the Met.

'I think you need to distinguish the difference between the Met and the police authority,' he said.

'I think there is an attitude within the police authority and particularly among some of the individuals who have been there for a very long time, the last 10 years, who simply say we do have a suspicion around senior ethnic minority officers.'

Dizaei is due to stand trial again early next year accused of misconduct in a public office and perverting the course of justice.

He launched a bid to get his job back after he was let out of Leyhill open prison when Lord Justice Hughes and two other judges said the Court of Appeal had been 'driven to the conclusion' that his conviction 'cannot be regarded as safe'.

Under the terms of his suspension, he is entitled to draw a full salary while he awaits the re-trial.

In addition, the former president of the National Black Police Association is expected to receive substantial damages from the owners of the now-defunct News of the World, which allegedly hacked his mobile phone voicemails.

His case is a major test of the 
leadership of new Met chief Bernard Hogan-Howe, who has preached the 
importance of integrity, honesty and fairness during his first full week
in charge of Britain’s biggest force.

News
of Mr Dizaei’s reinstatement was first revealed yesterday by BBC Radio 
4’s Today programme, which has a long history of running positive 
stories about him.

It was 
the same programme which disclosed before Christmas that Mr Dizaei’s 
lawyers had uncovered grounds for his original convictions to be 
quashed.

Yesterday Mr 
Dizaei said: ‘I am delighted to be reinstated. I have always wanted to 
be a Met Police officer and now vow to clear my name.’

Later,
announcing his suspension, the police authority said: ‘Suspension is 
not a disciplinary sanction and it is emphasised that suspension should 
not be taken as a presumption of guilt.’

Mr
Dizaei is due to stand trial at Southwark Crown Court in South London 
accused of misconduct in a public office and perverting the course of 
justice. He was at court for a pre-trial hearing yesterday.

The
charges are linked to an incident outside the Persian Yas restaurant in
Kensington, West London, on July 18, 2008. Mr Dizaei is accused of 
arresting a man after a row despite knowing he did not have reasonable 
grounds to do so.

He is also
alleged to have perverted the course of justice by falsely claiming in 
written statements that he was a victim of an unprovoked assault by the 
man.

Mr Dizaei, who denies the charges, was released from prison in May after 15 months behind bars.

He has retained the services of PSB Law, a Central London firm which specialises in ‘reputation and brand protection’.

Yesterday the firm issued a statement which hinted that race issues could feature in future proceedings.

It said: ‘Commander Dizaei has always maintained that his previous dismissal from the Metropolitan Police Force [in March 2010] pending his criminal appeal was in haste and unfair. That appeal was heard in May of this year and resulted in the quashing of Commander Dizaei’s convictions.

‘Commander Dizaei has on-going proceedings in the employment tribunal against the Metropolitan Police Authority and a number of senior individuals in that organisation relating to the way in which Commander Dizaei has been treated over a substantial period.’

According to the BBC, his lawyers have also said he will consider challenging his suspension in the courts, claiming many senior white police staff have been allowed to stay in their posts while criminal investigations take place.

The allegations against Dizaei stem from an incident that took place at the Yas restaurant, pictured, in Kensington, London

A thorn in the side of at least three commissioners, he has been outspoken critic of senior ranks.

Last year the 49-year-old became the most senior policeman to be jailed for corruption in 33 years after he was convicted of misconduct.

Mr Dizaei, whose father was deputy commissioner of Tehran’s police force, came to Britain in 1973 and was privately educated before training as a barrister and joining Thames Valley police in 1986.

He rose swiftly through the ranks and was poached by the Met in 1999, the year in which the Macpherson report accused the force of being 'institutionally racist'.

Senior officers were keen to promote talented young ethnic minority officers. As such, he quickly became outspoken on race issues as well as gaining quick promotion and being elected as president of the Black Police Association. He was also the most senior Muslim officer in the UK. 

In 2009 he was charged with misconduct after an inquiry by the Independent Police Complaints Commission and then convicted at Southwark crown court in February last year. 

Supporters claimed that he had again been victimised because of his race. Mr Dizaei, who has three sons, is married to third wife Shy.
