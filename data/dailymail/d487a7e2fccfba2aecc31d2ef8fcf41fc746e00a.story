Jurors in Cheyenne are set to begin deliberating in the trial of a 75-year-old Missouri woman accused of killing her husband in Wyoming in the mid-1970s.

Alice Uden, of Chadwick, Missouri, is charged with first-degree murder in the death of Ronald Holtz.

Jurors heard closing arguments Tuesday and the judge dismissed them for the day after they got the case Tuesday evening.

Actions of the past: Alice Uden listens to the judge during jury selection last week. Uden faces one count of first-degree murder for allegedly killing her husband nearly 40 years ago. The jury are about to begin their deliberation

Prosecutors allege Alice Uden, 75, and husband Gerald Uden, 71, each murdered their spouses before later marrying each other, though the cases have not been officially linked

Uden testified she shot her 24-year-old husband at their Cheyenne home to stop Holtz as he was set to attack her 2-year-old daughter.

Prosecutors say Uden shot her husband as he slept.

Uden met Holtz when she was a nurse at a Veterans Administration hospital in Sheridan, and Holtz, who'd been a helicopter gunner in Vietnam, was a psychiatric patient.

Uden's attorneys say Holtz became abusive soon after they married in September 1974, and Uden shot him in the back of the head when he was about to attack the little girl.

Last week, prosecutors called Uden's 
daughter, Theresa Twyford, 55, of Naples, Illinois, to testify. Twyford 
said Friday her mother once told her, too, she shot Holtz as he slept.

The 'matter of fact' 
conversation happened in Illinois, she said, where Twyford was living at
 the time in the 1970s. Both she and her mother had been drinking, she 
said.

Reagan Uden, 10, left, and Richard Uden, 11, right, were shot in the back of the head by their stepfather Gerald Uden. He is now serving life in prison for their murders

Last fall, authorities arrested Alice Uden and her fourth and current husband, Gerald Uden, 71, in Missouri.

Gerald
 Uden subsequently pleaded guilty and is serving life in prison for 
killing his ex-wife and her two children in central Wyoming in 1980, 
however investigators haven't linked the two cases.

Mr Uden's ex-wife Virginia Uden, 32, and her two sons, Richard, 11, and Reagan, 10, went missing in September 1980.

A couple of months later, sheriff's deputies found the family's Ford station wagon, with blood stains in it, abandoned off the side of a mountain road.

Uden told a courtroom in Lander he shot the three with a .22-caliber rifle before dumping their bodies first in an abandoned mine, then in Fremont Lake north of Pinedale in western Wyoming.

Investigators spent a couple of days searching the 600-foot-deep lake last fall before calling off the search for the winter.

The search for the bodies remains suspended.

He is serving a life sentence, the same penalty Mrs (Alice) Uden could face.
