Suits you Sophie: The Countess's red outfit dazzles as she keeps a close eye on son James 

First Prince Charles was bemused by being described as ‘quite buff’ during his 1970s sporting heyday. Now his brother Edward has unveiled his own toned torso on a family holiday in the Med.

Edward and Sophie Wessex – who also looked impressively trim in a dazzling red one-piece swimsuit – enjoyed a day at a public beach with their children on the tiny uninhabited island of Espalmador, off Ibiza, which is famous with some visitors for its naturist beaches and mud baths.

The Countess, who turns 50 next year, has been putting in a lot of work at the gym in a bid to keep up with the glamour of the Duchess of Cambridge – and it has clearly paid off.

Sophie has dropped a dress size and shed a stone in weight after taking hour-long exercise sessions several times a week with a personal trainer.

Edward, who celebrated his 50th in March, also looked trim. He has been so impressed by his wife’s transformation that he engaged the same trainer.

The couple, who celebrated their 15th wedding anniversary last month, now go on twice-weekly five-mile runs around the grounds of their home at Bagshot Park, near Windsor. Friends say they decided to get fitter after Kate married into the Royal Family.

‘It’s a case of keeping up with the Cambridges,’ said one source.

‘Sophie started to dress better, she shopped at designer stores and dropped a dress size and a stone in weight after hiring her trainer.

‘She didn’t want to be seen as the frumpy one so she sharpened up her act. She takes her fitness, diet, and health very seriously and recently Edward saw how much better she looked. He started using Sophie’s personal trainer and he’s delighted with the results.’

The Prince, who left the Royal Marines during basic training, declaring: ‘I’m no Rambo’, is said to love the ‘boot-camp’ work-outs.

Comments about the Royal physique caused bewilderment and laughter this month at a function at a swimming pool attended by the Prince of Wales.

A topless photograph of a muscular Charles in his diving days in the 1970s was discussed, and a guest described him as ‘quite buff’. Prince William was also at the event and had to explain the reference to his father.

Edward and Sophie arrived in the Balearics a week ago with their children Lady Louise, ten, and James, Viscount Severn, six. Traditionally the Wessexes holiday in the Bahamas and Positano in Italy. 

By visiting Ibiza, they are following in the footsteps of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who in 2010 stayed at a villa on the Spanish island belonging to Kate’s colourful uncle Gary Goldsmith – the infamous Maison de Bang Bang.

The Wessexes are believed to be staying aboard a luxury yacht belonging to a close friend.

Later in the summer they will return to Britain to visit the Queen and Prince Philip for their traditional break at Balmoral.

Sophie and the Queen are said to be exceptionally close. The source said: ‘The Queen probably sees more of Sophie and the children than the rest of her family.’
