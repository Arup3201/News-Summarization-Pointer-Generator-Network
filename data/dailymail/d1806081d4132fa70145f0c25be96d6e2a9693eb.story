An inquest into the death of Reggae star Smiley Culture today heard he plunged a kitchen knife into his heart during a drugs raid at his home

A British reggae star plunged a kitchen knife into his heart during a drugs raid on his home, an inquest heard today.

DJ Smiley Culture, whose real name was David Emmanuel, suddenly changed as officers searched his home after initially appearing calm and relaxed.

The 48-year-old musician screamed: 'Do you f***ing want some of this?' as he plunged the knife into his chest.

Today a jury heard four Metropolitan Police officers carried out a raid on Mr Emmanuel’s home in Warlingham, Surrey, on March 15, 2011.

At the time he was awaiting trial at Croydon Crown Court with two co-defendants for allegedly supplying class A drugs.

Giving an overview of events Surrey Coroner Richard Travers said officers arrived at the gated property at 7am on the fateful day and arrested Mr Emmanuel on conspiracy to import Class A drugs.

One of the officers had had previous dealings with the musician and always found him 'courteous, respectful, and compliant,' the jury heard.

As a result he was deemed low risk.

Mr Travers explained that one of the officers remained with Mr Emmanuel while the other three searched the property.

During this time he appeared relaxed and was allowed to make himself a number of cups of tea, the coroner said.

The musician’s niece called at the address in the middle of the search and described her uncle as 'calm and a little bewildered.'

Mr Travers said: 'You’ll hear from 
witness two that he was coming to the end of the search and started the 
final entry in the premises search record, which was entry 13, when Mr 
Emmanuel suddenly, without warning, stood up and witness two realised he
 - Mr Emmanuel - had a large knife in his hand.

'The officer says he shouted out "knife," so as to warn other colleagues which were present.

'Mr Emmanuel screamed: "Do you f***ing want some of this or what about this?"

'You will hear that the face and body language completely changed and he was screaming.'

Using both hands he then plunged the knife into his chest.

witness two that he was coming to the end of the search and started the 
final entry in the premises search record, which was entry 13, when Mr 
Emmanuel suddenly, without warning, stood up and witness two realised he - Mr Emmanuel - had a large knife in his hand'

Despite the efforts of officers to perform first aid he was declared dead at the scene.

A post mortem examination concluded he died as a result of loss of blood due to a stab wound. Pathologist Dr Robert Chapman said the injury would have required moderate force.

The coroner told the jury that the four officers who were at the address at the time of Mr Emmanuel’s death will be giving evidence at the hearing from behind screens.

He ruled that they cannot be named for legal reasons.

Mr Emmanuel had worked with Maxi Priest and Papa Levi and saw his singles, Cockney Translation and Police Officer, chart in 1984.

The latter song was about him being arrested for possession of cannabis but then being let off when the officer realised he was a famous reggae artist.

The hearing in Woking, Surrey, was expected to last up to three weeks.

The hearing in front of a jury of five men and six women continues.
