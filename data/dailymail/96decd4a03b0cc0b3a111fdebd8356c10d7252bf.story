Sir James Munby (pictured), the country’s top family law judge, said allowing the press to see files would allow reporters to understand sensitive cases better

Secretive documents on cases in the family courts could be disclosed to the Press to help them ‘perform their watchdog role’, a leading judge said yesterday.

Sir James Munby, the country’s top family law judge, said it would allow reporters to understand sensitive cases better – and help safeguard against miscarriages of justice.

The president of the Family Division said the proposal would be one way of ‘opening up’ the notoriously secret court to ‘public scrutiny’.

Cases of children being taken from their parents into state care, adoption, and where children should live when families break up are normally held behind closed doors or have strict reporting restrictions.

Members of the public could also be permitted into the family courts to watch their secretive hearings.

The proposals, outlined in a consultation document, are a boost to the Daily Mail’s campaign against court cases being held in private after we exposed a series of scandals resulting from justice being conducted in private.

We have highlighted controversial decisions made behind closed doors in the family courts and the even more secretive Court of Protection, which deals with the affairs of vulnerable adults.

Unveiling his plans on ending secrecy in the family courts, Sir James said: ‘There is a need for greater transparency in order to improve public understanding of the court process and confidence in the court system.’

He added: ‘The public has a legitimate interest in being able to read what is being done by the judges in its name.’

He said he would consult lawyers, judges, social services chiefs, the media and families about the possibility of ‘hearing in public of certain types of family case'.

In the past, such cases have always been closed to the public because of fears that neighbours and those who knew the families could attend the hearings and then spread damaging gossip about children.

Reporters were only allowed to attend after then Justice Secretary Jack Straw changed the law in 2009 – but they can still be thrown out by a judge under special circumstances.

After receiving submissions on the proposals, he will publish another consultation paper before running a pilot exercise.

Sir James also suggested a trial allowing media should also be allowed access to more paperwork involved in family cases, including arguments, summaries, fact-finding documents and experts’ reports.

He said he was aware of ‘nervousness’ among professionals in the family justice system but argued it would help ‘facilitate their understanding of the case and to assist them in performing their watchdog role’.

He said the Press could then ‘decide quickly whether the case is one they would wish to attend, as they are entitled to do so.’

Sir James’ proposals do not cover the controversial Court of Protection, set up under Labour’s Mental Capacity Act in 2007 to decide on the lives of those too ill to make their own decisions.

Earlier this year, the Mail’s campaign scored a huge victory when Sir James announced decisions by secret courts that can lead to children being taken from their parents or old people forced into care homes are finally to be opened up to public scrutiny.

He said judgments in the family courts and the Court of Protection must be made public except in cases where there is a clear reason to dictate they should not be.

Over the past year, we have highlighted scandals in the Court of Protection including the secret imprisonment of a 50-year-old woman and a forced caesarean on an Italian woman who was then made to give up her child for adoption.
