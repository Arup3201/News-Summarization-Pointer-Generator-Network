She stands beaming at the immaculate bride, and at the dress she has so carefully designed.

Despite the fact L'Wren Scott would never marry her longtime love, Sir Mick Jagger, she poured her heart and soul into making a wedding gown for her close friend, fashion stylist JoJo Cohen.

Tragically, it would be the only ever wedding dress that L'Wren would design, worn by JoJo at her wedding in January - just two months before the statuesque brunette would take her life aged 49.

Happy family: L'Wren Scott's dear friend, Jo Jo Cohen, her new husband Eric Fleiss and his three young children

JoJo, 31, married Eric Fleiss on January 18 in Los Angeles, and pictures in the new edition of Martha Stewart Weddings show the stunning detail on her gown.

The blonde chose her friend L'Wren to make her dream dress, saying: 'Her instinct and knowledge of a woman's body were unlike anyone else's.

'We both also shared a love of flowers, and the dress was a magnificent reflection of that, with blossoms everywhere.'

The gown was L'Wren's first wedding dress commission, and JoJo recalls: 'L'Wren said it was the greatest honor.'

The pair worked together on the design together - 'we spoke the same language from the start', JoJo said - before L'Wren sent the dress to the Royal School of Needlework in the UK.

There, the talented artists - who had also worked on the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding gown - embroidered the dress with vintage pearls.

Eric's first wife Susan had passed away from colon cancer in early 20011, leaving him to care for their three children.

Honoring L'Wren: L'Wren may never have married her love Mick Jagger, but her eye for romance is captured in photos in the new issue of Martha Stewart Weddings

L'Wren, who was together with Rolling Stones frontman Sir Mick Jagger for 13 years up until her death, was found hanging at her New York apartment on March 17.

Before her death, Vogue followed her making JoJo's wedding dress as she teamed up with milliner Stephen Jones, who made JoJo's veil.

In a video on the fashion bible's website released as a tribute to L'Wren, the 6ft 3ins tall designer can been seen gasping as she sees the intricate embroidery for the dress.

She says: 'I got very heavily involved in this dress because it's very intense work when you create something couture for somebody's incredibly special day.'

And she muses: 'It should be about the 
girl, the biggest compliment is you're just enhancing her - how 
beautiful she is on her special day.'

As she 
smiles and floats about the room holding the veil, L'Wren adds: 'It's a 
very L'Wren Scott silhouette and I do love to define a woman's real 
curves, so I think it will go down quite well.'

At
 the end of video clip, L'Wren - who carries the train of JoJo's dress 
to the wedding ceremony - is then seen poignantly clutching the bride's 
bouquet.

At the time of L'Wren's death, MailOnline told how her eponymous fashion label owed more than $6 million to creditors, with her friend Cathy Horyn claiming she committed suicide just days before her business was due to close.

But The Sun reported in May that the company will now be taken under the wing of John Hoffman, a director at London store Selfridges.

They stated the deal will last for two years.

L'Wren left her entire $9million fortune to Jagger, according to her will.
