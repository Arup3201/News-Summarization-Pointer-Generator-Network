A stag’s antlers are his pride and joy, his protection and his way of attracting a mate, but from December he sheds them and those all-important horns are all but gone.

For the stag that is.

An army of people across Britain and Europe roam parks and woodlands every year, collecting hundreds of thousands of deer antlers to fashion them into walking sticks, furniture or ground them down for Chinese medicine but now the valuable antlers are being turned into dog chews.

Eight tons of antlers were prepared and dispatched from a warehouse in Southampton, Hampshire to pet shops across the country last month, keeping up with the growing demand for the dog chews, called Stagbars.

Glenn Campbell, owner of Pure Dog, the company who makes them, said: ‘We recently had an order for thirty thousand bars from Pets at Home – they’re in all their stores now.

‘It all started nearly two years ago. We’re both passionate dog lovers – we’d looked for ideas and wanted to offer something completely different.

First in the UK: Mr Campbell's company is the first in the UK to turn deer antlers into chews that plenty of British dogs are enjoying, including this one pictured

British are the favourites: A quarter of the antlers come from Scotland and Mr Campbell said 'The British ones are our favourites because they have the smallest carbon footprint'

‘We knew antler dog chews were popular in America so we decided to be the first to do them in the UK.’

What started as a part-time enterprise at home for Mr Campbell and wife Deborah has now got so busy they have left their jobs and moved the business into a 1,800 sq ft warehouse four months ago.

Mr Campbell said: ‘I think they’re so popular because they last a long time, are natural and different and people love to spoil their dogs.

‘About 25 per cent of our antlers come 
from Scotland and a small number come from Exmoor. The British ones are 
our favourites because they have the smallest carbon footprint.

‘The rest of our stock is mainly found in Spain and Germany and is imported from our European suppliers.

‘None of our antlers come from farms or culled animals. They can all be traced to where they were harvested. We work alongside DEFRA to meet their stringent regulations.’

They employ between five and ten people in their factory.

On their website, Stagbars are described as: ‘They wear down slowly with the grinding action of the dog’s teeth and saliva, into tasty morsels. Eventually, the dry marrow is exposed as a lovely treat when the outside has been worn away. They are suitable for puppies who are teething.

‘They clean the dog’s teeth, rather than bung them up and they’re great for dogs with sensitive tummies. Even dogs who are losing weight can enjoy Stagbars because they only contain a tiny amount of fat.’

The antlers are cut into different sized Stagbars suitable for different sized dogs.

Ready for mating season: Stag's antlers grow to attract a mate and fight off other males and after they shed them during the rutting season, a new, larger rack will grow in time for the next mating season

Stag’s antlers are grown purely to attract females and to fight off other males. 

Every year they grow a new larger, rack with more points ready for the mating season. 

A stag’s age can be determined by the number of points on his antlers. 

Deer antlers are among the fastest growing tissues known to man, growing as much as an inch per day during peak development in the summer.
