Social housing tenants at a new multi-million pound development have been told to keep off a section of grass because it is reserved for the owners of the building's luxury apartments.

Tenants residing in the 43 affordable flats at the new One Tower Bridge complex in Southwark, London, will not be allowed on the development's 'podium garden' when it is completed in 2017.

Property developer Berkeley Homes was granted permission to ban all tenants from the special area, unless they pay an additional service charge, during a Southwark Council planning committee meeting.

The 'podium garden', located between blocks three and four of the development (plans shown above), will feature a courtyard area, fountain and lily pond but will only be available to social tenants for an additional fee

One Tower Bridge, in Southwark, London, is set to be completed by 2017 and will feature a mix of 356 luxury apartments and 43 affordable homes. It is being developed by Berkeley Homes and will overlook the Thames

Original planning proposals for the One Tower Bridge complex, where some apartments are worth up to £15million, allowed social housing tenants access to all of the grounds.

However, the decision was reversed following approval from the council and now any tenant who wishes to enjoy the 'podium garden', which includes a courtyard, fountain and lily pond, will have to pay an additional surcharge.

According to Berkeley Homes, rent for Horace Jones House – the social housing section of the One Tower Bridge development – starts at a minimum of £171 a week for a one-bedroom flat, rising to a maximum of £161 a week for a three-bedroom flat.

An additional service charge, which includes heating and water bills, ranges from £29 to £62 a week depending on flat size.

Berkeley Homes said the cost of maintaining the 'podium garden' would increase the additional service charge by around 20 per cent.

It means the garden area - which is located between blocks three and four - is predominantly designated for those living in privately-owned riverside apartments at the development, which are on the market for between £1.5million and £15million.

At the deciding committee meeting last Tuesday, Berkeley Homes argued that the social housing tenants would still be able to use a communal children's play area and a roof garden on top of their eight-storey block.

In submitting its request to charge tenants a surcharge for use of the 'podium garden', Berkeley Homes said it was necessary because of the cost of maintaining the area.

It also said the additional charge would be levied to cover the cost of issuing access fobs, door entry maintenance, electricity or water and cleaning.

The developer said those in the luxury apartments would have a 24-hour service to a Harrods concierge and access to a spa, gym and indoor golf simulator.

At the committee meeting, Simon Bevan, director of planning at Southwark Council, said the exclusion of social housing tenants was 'not seen as any significant restriction on how they enjoy their property'.

However, Darren Johnson, Green party London Assembly Member, said: 'This trend shows contempt for ordinary people, and is about developers selling luxury flats to rich investors who don't want to mix with local people.

'Mayor Boris Johnson and councils have been turning a blind eye to this for too long.

'They should simply refuse applications that have separate facilities or that refuse any affordable housing on this basis.'

Liberal Democrat MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark Simon Hughes also criticised the council's decision.

He said: 'Southwark Council has dropped the ball here - they should have thought about this more carefully before it went to planning committee.'

Liberal Democrat MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark Simon Hughes criticised the decision to segregate tenants by forcing those in social housing to pay for access to the development's special 'podium garden'

Berkeley Homes said the City of London Corporation, which is to act as the social tenants' landlord, expressed concern at the level of service charge. 

The developers said in a statement: 'The Corporation of London had previously expressed concerns about the maintenance costs associated with their own communal roof gardens as well as the level of their service charge.

'These issues are exacerbated by access to the podium garden which brings with it a separate additional service charge that pays for management and maintenance of the garden, fob access through one of the private blocks and maintenance of the access areas.

'In reality, the affordable housing residents on this development will enjoy three times as much communal amenity space per home as the private residents.

'Every affordable home on this site enjoys two substantial roof-top communal gardens with amazing views over the river Thames, Tower of London and Tower Bridge.'

The development, which includes 356 luxury flats and 43 social housing flats, first gained planning permission in 2011 and is set to be complete by 2017.

Owners and tenants of the luxury apartments will have access to a gym, rooftop Jacuzzis, swimming pools and spas, the developer said.
