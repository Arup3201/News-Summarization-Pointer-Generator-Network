To all those wondering what specific talents models actually have... just take a look at this video.

The YouTube video shows an extremely agile young lady - reportedly a Russian model - eating a box of Chinese takeaway while wakeboarding behind a speedboat. Serious multitasking.

Uploaded by user Good Lucky, the 2min 33sec film - helpfully entitled 'sexy model eats Chinese food wakeboarding in Russia' - is sound-tracked by atmospheric dance music.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

The Russian model nimbly manoeuvres herself into position to eat her food

The video of the hungry, sporty lady has been watched over 1,400 times on YouTube

The young model never loses her balance, even while using a pair of chopsticks

Towards the end of the video the model sits down on the wakeboard, presumably to allow her food to digest
