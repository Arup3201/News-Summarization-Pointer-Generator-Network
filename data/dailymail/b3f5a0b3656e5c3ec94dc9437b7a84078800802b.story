A Canadian woman received the suprise of her life when an anonymous benefactor appeared at her doorstep and offered her a bank draft worth thousands of dollars to help pay for medical treatment.

Stephanie Headley, 48, is fighting systemic scleroderma, CBC News reported. She told the news agency she was hopeful that a treatment at a Chicago hospital would help her - but it costs $125,000 USD.

Mysterious gift: An anonymous man gave Stephanie Headley, center, a bank draft worth $128,000 CDN to cover her medical expenses

The single mother of four said in an online donation page 'This Auto Immune disease is rare and literally turns me to stone inside and out. My internal organs and skin are turning hard.'

'Having had the disease since 2002 we are now in the end stages,' she also wrote.'[...] I have a 48% lung capacity and am on oxygen 24/7 I cannot eat anything but liquids because my GI System is so damaged and suffer with a lot of nausea and GI pain. All my joints are terribly painful as they are so stiff it hurts to move and I need strong IV narcotics every 2hrs.'

Headley told the Kanata Kourier-Standard that though her family tried to raise money in May, she did not have enough - just $13,000.

'The disease started to progress and I started to show more pain and more gastro-intestinal symptoms and more breathing problems,' she told the website.

However, she added that on July 3 a man called her before he arrived at her home carrying the bank draft. He wore sunglasses and a hat, she told the newspaper. 

Generous: The man appeared at Headley's doorstep with this bank draft worth $128,000 meant to help pay for her treatment at a Chicago hospital. Headley is fighting systemic scleroderma

Family: Headley's four children, three of whom are seen here, have asked for donations to help cover their mother's remaining medical expenses. They are seeking $5,000 CDN

'He shows up at the door and he says nothing to me,' she told the Kourier-Standard. 'Very straight faced, he hands me this envelope, and then I turn around and hand him a thank-you card.

'Just before he turned around to leave, I said, ‘Bless you,’ and he smiled … and then he turned around and left. Not a word, not one word.'

Headley told the Kourier-Standard she was shocked to see the bank draft was worth $128,000 CDN.

'I really want to thank God, and I really want to thank this man from the bottom of my heart,' she told the newspaper. The treatment, she added, gives her an 80 percent survival rate.

Headley and her four children are still asking for donations to cover the remaining expenses, worth $5,000 CDN.

Headley's daughter Skylar Headley-Skinkle called the mysterious man an 'anonymous angel' on a page for donations.

'We will be forever paying this back to humanity by giving back to others in anyway we can as a thank you to you always,' she said.
