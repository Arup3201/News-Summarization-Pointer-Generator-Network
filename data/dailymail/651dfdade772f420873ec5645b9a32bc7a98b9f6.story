Massimo Cellino, the former Leeds United president, will not return to the club until the end of the season.

The Football League had disqualified him from running the Championship club until April 10 in January. He decided to step away from the club last month in order to clear his name.

However, the Football League have now said that they have 'settled the outstanding disciplinary proceedings' against Cellino and the club and he can return from May 3.

Cellino was disqualified in January after the the non-disclosure of a tax evasion charge against him in Italy

A league statement read: 'The Football League, Leeds United and Massimo Cellino have settled the outstanding disciplinary proceedings relating to the club's non-disclosure of the Italian Court's judgment regarding Mr Cellino, as required under League regulations.

'The club and Mr Cellino have decided in the interests of the club, its players and supporters not to contest this charge. As a result, Mr Cellino's period of disqualification as a 'relevant person', as defined by the regulations, has now been extended from April 10 until May 3, the day after the conclusion of the 2014/15 league season.

'Mr Cellino's right to challenge the decision of the Professional Conduct Committee under Football Association Rule K is unaffected by this settlement. '

Cellino, who took over Leeds towards the end of last season, has decided to independently appeal his Football League disqualification which was initially due to expire on April 10. 

Cellino recently sold his personal stake in Eleonora Sport - the company he set up to buy Leeds a year ago - and said he would not be returning to the club while he tries to clear his name, giving rise to speculation he could be about to sell up.

Andrew Umbers, who stepped in as chairman when Cellino's ban began, insists Cellino does not want to sell and that there have not been any approaches, despite interest from Hollywood film star Russell Crowe, a long-standing Leeds fan who asked his Twitter followers if taking over the club would be a good idea and got an overwhelmingly positive response.

Leeds' fortunes on the pitch have certainly not been affected by the ownership uncertainty with the 2-1 win over Ipswich at Elland Road on Wednesday night their sixth in nine games, a run which has lifted them clear of the relegation zone and into 15th place.
