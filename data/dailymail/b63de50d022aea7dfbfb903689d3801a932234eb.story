Liverpool are interested in bringing in a new goalkeeper, and Fiorentina stopper Neto looks to be top of Brendan Rodgers' list.

The 25-year-old Brazilian, who played twice in the Olympics for his country in 2012, would most likely be competition for current No 1 Simon Mignolet, rather than a straight replacement.

Neto's contract runs out in June 2015, and Liverpool would prefer a free move in the summer window, but may talk to him in January.

Neto has been linked with league leaders Juventus after a string of fine performances, claiming five clean sheets with Fiorentina in 11th place but with the fourth-best defensive record.

Rodgers is looking to bring in competition for Belgian Mignolet, who has been struggling for form over the past few months.

Liverpool's defensive record has been poor this season, conceding 15 goals in 11 games and claiming just four wins having finished second last term.
