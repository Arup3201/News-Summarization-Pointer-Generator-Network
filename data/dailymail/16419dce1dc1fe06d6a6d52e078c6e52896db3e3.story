This is the chilling moment a gunman was caught on CCTV calmly tucking a pistol into his waist band - seconds after he shot a dad-of-three to death on a packed nightclub dancefloor.

Vincent Ashman, 38, shot Danny McCalla, 50, six times in the head, chest, shoulder, arm and thigh at the Tropical Harmony club in Bilston, West Midlands, in the early hours of November 21, 2009.

Two days after the murder, Ashman - who was known as 'Chopper' - boarded a flight to Jamaica, where he remained in hiding until he was extradited back to the UK in July last year.

Today a jury at Birmingham Crown Court 
found Ashman guilty of murdering Mr McCalla, who was known as 
'Dannyman', with a 9mm handgun.

Police have released footage of Ashman walking out of the club as hundreds of panicking revellers fled the shooting.

Another image captured on the nightclub security camera showed Ashman holding the black pistol by his side as he made his way to the exit.

During the eight-day trial, it emerged Mr McCalla, a mechanic from Dudley, West Midlands, had hit Ashman with a baton just seconds before he was fatally shot.

Witnesses told the jury Ashman fired the handgun repeatedly at Mr McCalla on the dancefloor of the club following an argument.

Mr McCalla was pronounced dead in hospital almost an hour later despite frantic attempts by police and paramedics to save his life.

A forensic examination found that the gun had been fired seven times and that six bullets had hit Mr McCalla.

Scene: The shooting took place at the Tropical Harmony club, in Bilston, in the early hours of November 21, 2009

Prosecutor Rachel Brand QC said the death of Mr McCalla had caused a 'devastating sense of loss' to his family.

The jury also found Ashman, of no fixed address, not guilty of a separate charge of shooting at former professional cricketer Calver Wright near the Waggon and Horses pub, in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, in July 2008.

He is expected to receive a life sentence of at least 30 years when he appears in court tomorrow.

Speaking after the verdict, Mr McCalla's son Reuben described his father as a 'good dad'. He added: 'He was kind, hard-working, loving and spiritual.

'He was a friend not only to me but to lots of people in the community that he lived in.'

Detective Sergeant Michael Griffiths, from West Midlands Police, added: 'I'm pleased with the guilty verdict and that Ashman has been held to account for his actions.

'Vincent Ashman carried a loaded handgun around with him and he must have known the potential consequences of carrying a loaded firearm.

'This was a man who was intent on killing. He shot at Danny McCalla not once, but seven times in quick succession, ending his life in the most brutal way.

'I'm pleased with the guilty verdict and that Ashman has been held to account for his actions. This has been a complex and lengthy investigation and my thoughts are now with Danny McCalla's family, who can hopefully take some comfort now that justice has been done.'

During the eight-day trial, the jury heard there was bad feeling between Ashman and Mr McCalla because the victim believed his killer had burgled his home six months previously.

Prosecutor Ms Rachel Brand QC told the court Mr McCalla had hit Ashman with a baton just seconds before he was shot six times on the dancefloor.

During the trial, owner of the Tropical Harmony club, Michael Chambers, told the jury he saw Ashman pull the trigger after Mr McCalla attacked him with the baton.

However Sir Desmond De Silva QC, defending Ashman, claimed Mr Chambers was mistaken in his identification of Ashman and that a gun he saw in the defendant’s hand was a mobile phone.
