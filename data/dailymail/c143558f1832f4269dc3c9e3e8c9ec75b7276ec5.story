An unsuspecting Manchester man had his pizza snatched by a passenger in a passing car - before a video of the  'drive-by' theft was posted online.

The victim was standing, holding his takeaway, at a bus stop in the city  when the car  drove past and a man grabbed the food from his hands.

The group in the car then posted a film of the incident online, which shows the vehicle slowing down as it passes the bus stop so a man can lean out of the window and snatch the pizza.

The theft took place in the Fallowfield area of the city in the early hours of Saturday morning.

It is believed the man who grabbed the pizza was Dan Jackson, 28, from nearby Heald Green, who had been on his way home with friends after celebrating a birthday. 

But Mr Jackson said he didn't mean to cause offence and has since bought the victim a replacement £12.95 pizza, delivering it to his home.

He said: 'We were driving through town and just saw this guy stood at the bus stop, it was hilarious because he was stood holding it out like a waiter.

It just had to be done.

But police have hit out at the thieves, saying the video shows them driving dangerously through a red light

'When we found out who it was, we knew we had to replace his pizza and get it back to him.

'We didn't mean to cause any offence, we just wanted to have a laugh, like prank TV.'

A video of the incident was filmed from the back seat of the car, which appears to have four men in it.

After one of the group says 'ready', the car passes the bus stop and, without stopping, the man in the passenger seat leans out and takes the pizza box.

As a woman at the bus stop screams, the car then speeds up and pulls away as the group inside burst into laughter.

Mr Jackson who took the pizza exclaims 'It's a whole pizza' and another replies: 'We need to pull over.'

Greater Manchester Police have taken a dim view of the video though, saying the group appear to be driving dangerously.

A spokesman said: 'As funny as those in the car seem to think this is, not only have they stolen someone's pizza, it appears from the footage that they drove through a red light.

'The consequences of ignoring traffic lights can be catastrophic and is absolutely no laughing matter.'
