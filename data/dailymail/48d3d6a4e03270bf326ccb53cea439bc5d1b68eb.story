Bowe Bergdahl's platoon in Afghanistan was a group of 'raggedy misfits' who had discipline problems even before Bergdahl 'abandoned his post,' a new report claims.

Two commanders of Second Platoon, Blackfoot Company in the First Battalion, 501st Regiment were dismissed while the unit was deployed to a remote outpost in Afghanistan in 2009.

And the unit came under scrutiny from commanders when pictures emerged of soldiers wearing cut-off T-shirts and bandanas on duty - a violation of military procedure.

A report in the New York Times on Saturday cites a classified military investigation that faulted the platoon for lax discipline before Bergdahl went missing from his outpost in  Paktika Province.

The Times characterizes the unit as 'raggedy misfits.'

The newspaper cites a classified Army investigation of Bergdahl's disappearance that found discipline lapses.

Military investigators also faulted Bergdah's unit for having lax security that allowed him to leave the post without being noticed. 

Leadership was also a problem in the platoon of two dozen men, the Times reports.

The officer originally sent to command the unit was relieved weeks after the soldiers arrived in Afghanistan. Soldiers from his unit told the Times his leadership was 'less than inspiring.'

Then, the sergeant first class who replaced him as the head of the platoon was disciplined when pictures emerged of members of the unit wearing bandanas and cutoff t-shirts - clothing that is against military regulations.

Two platoons commanders were fired by the military during their deployment - including a sergeant who was removed after Bergdahl went missing

When Bergdahl went missing, the sergeant first class was removed from command, as well.

Fox News responded to the report claiming that it was politically motivated. Samuel Masamitsu, who served in the platoon with Bergdahl, denied that the unit's discipline with anything to do with the soldier's disappearance.

'As far as us being dysfunctional or responsible in some way for (Bergdahl's disappearance), I think it's a completely false allegation,' he told the network.

Many men who served with Bergdahl say he deserted his post and that six soldiers died looking for him in the following months.
