The mysterious woman branded the 'vamp in the veil' has spoken out about her High Court battle 'hell'

The so-called ‘Vamp in a veil’, accused of scamming a pair of property developers out of luxury flats worth £14million, could now face deportation for giving  immigration officials a  false identity.

Sara Al Amoudi, who is also accused of posing as a Saudi royal and has variously claimed to be 31 and 43, has lived in Britain for more than ten years after she was granted refugee status.

According to her ‘victims’ Amanda Clutterbuck and Ian Paton, Miss Al Amoudi was a penniless Ethiopian prostitute who posed as a Saudi princess to swindle them out of a property empire.

High Court judge Sarah Asplin recently ruled Miss Al Amoudi could keep the flats, saying her true identity was irrelevant to the case. But remarkably, the judge admitted: ‘The exact identity of Ms Al Amoudi remains unknown.’

Buried in her lengthy judgement, however, was the revelation that Miss Al Amoudi was an asylum seeker who was granted refugee status by the Home Office.

And in a twist that will embarrass immigration judges, Judge Asplin ruled: ‘Had it been necessary, I would have found that Ms Al Amoudi’s father is not the person stated in the documents produced for the Home Office.’

Her refugee status has to be periodically reviewed, and she has not yet been awarded a UK passport. Now she could be belatedly deported because officials may not have been told the truth about her identity.

Her daughter Marni, 13, was born here however, meaning she would be able to argue the right to remain to preserve her ‘right to a family life’.

Property developers Amanda Clutterbuck and Ian Paton claimed they temporarily signed six flats in Knightsbridge over to Miss Al-Amoudi, but that no payment was forthcoming

Miss Al Amoudi has used her Home Office identity card to help raise a huge loan from the HSBC bank.

While
 in the country, she has been forced to answer allegations not only that
 she was a prostitute posing as a princess for an elaborate fraud, but 
also that she snorted cocaine and the horse tranquilliser ketamine on 
champagne-fuelled nights out.

She angrily denies being a prostitute, and claims her Muslim faith requires her to hide her face with a veil.

According
 to the High Court judgment, Miss Al Amoudi apparently first applied for
 asylum in March 2002, claiming that her father was ‘from a powerful 
business family in Saudi Arabia who owns amongst other things, the Hotel
 Intercontinental Jeddah and the Sheraton in Ethiopia’.

Mrs Justice Asplin accepted Miss Al-Amoudi's claim that she was having a secret affair with Mr Paton, 45, behind the back of his long-term girlfriend, and that the flats were repayment for millions she lent him

While Miss Al-Amoudi denied presenting herself as a princess as part of the scam, the judge noted that she has bodyguards and 'travels in a black Range Rover, part of the registration number of which is "HRH"'

Judge
 Asplin recorded that in court Miss Al Amoudi had accepted that two 
different Saudi billionaires named in previous documents given to the 
Home Office and banks as her father were not related to her, and blamed 
her lawyers or others searching on the internet for mistakenly using 
their names.

The Home Office has repeatedly refused to discuss Miss Al Amoudi’s refugee status, saying she is entitled to privacy.

Yesterday
 Miss Al Amoudi continued to deny prostitution claims, and maintained 
she faced execution in Saudi Arabia. She said: ‘This country is bad 
sometimes, the way they portray Muslim women. Racist.

‘But I also love this country because it saved me.’
