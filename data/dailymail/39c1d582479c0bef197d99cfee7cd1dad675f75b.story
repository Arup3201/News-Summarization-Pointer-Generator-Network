Ben Youngs choked back tears of more Six Nations title misery and admitted: ‘We are all devastated to go so close but not get the job done.’

The scrum-half was outstanding in an incredible game that left England ruing all those missed chances against Scotland the week before.

They hardly missed a chance at Twickenham this time but a dejected Youngs, who scored two fine tries, insisted: ‘All the lads are devastated. We felt for most of the game we had a chance but just could not make that gap bigger when we needed. We just could not get the job done.

‘Each time we got a try they seem to get one back and that was the biggest disappointment. But we were determined not to leave anything out there or waste any chances. It’s not very often you score seven tries, beat France and walk off feeling pretty sick.

‘But at least we have the consolation of winning a big game at Twickenham and showing people that we can finish off moves and score plenty of tries when we play this way.’

Head coach Stuart Lancaster admitted: ‘It’s disappointing to miss out on the title by a small margin again. It’s becoming an unfortunate habit and a not very nice one. But I can’t fault the guys for the total commitment and effort.

‘We played some cracking rugby and scored some great tries. But credit to Ireland for winning the title. It was another case of what might have been had we got this try or that one last week.’
