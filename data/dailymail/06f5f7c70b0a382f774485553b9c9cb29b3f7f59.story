Schalke have poked fun at fierce local rivals Borussia Dortmund after Jurgen Klopp’s side slumped to the bottom of the Bundesliga at the weekend.

Schalke’s official Twitter account posted a mock-up league table with the club in sixth place and Dortmund languishing down in 18th before quickly deleting it.

League leaders Bayern Munich are the only other side to feature in the table with caption: "Keep scrolling. You'll see them soon #MindTheGap," to rub salt into Dortmund's wounds.

The Ruhr derby is one of the fiercest rivalries in European football, first played back in 1925, and Schalke are clearly enjoying their bragging rights having won the most recent clash 2-1 in the Bundesliga back in September.

As for Dortmund, they have amassed only 11 points from 13 games. Even their ardent fans, who have stuck by the team throughout this troubled season, began to jeer their players after the Eintracht Frankfurt defeat.

On Sunday evening, Borussia Dortmund director of sport Michael Zorc conceded the club are 'in the middle of a relegation fight', as Klopp desperately needs to turn around his side’s fortunes, and very quickly.
