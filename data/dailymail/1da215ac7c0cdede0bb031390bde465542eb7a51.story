A depraved killer who sexually assaulted and murdered his step-grandmother after accessing hardcore pornography has been jailed for life.

Jack Huxley, 20, murdered 62-year-old Janis Dundas at her home in Atherton Road, Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, after she had taken him in 'out of the goodness of her heart', Liverpool Crown Court heard.

The pensioner was found by police officers face down in a pool of blood in her bedroom with three knives protruding from her back. She had been mutilated, stabbed and slashed 28 times and had suffered a sexual assault.

The court heard how Huxley accessed pornography showing sex between young men and mature women in the hours before and after the murder.

Sentencing Huxley to life, with a recommendation that he serve at least 21 years and eight months before being considered for parole, the Recorder of Liverpool Judge Clement Goldstone said the killing 'plumbed the depths of depravity and brutality'.

The defendant, who had taken a cocktail of alcohol and drugs at the time of the murder, was sentenced after pleading guilty to murder yesterday.

Huxley, with short cropped brown hair and wearing a white shirt, held his head in his hands throughout the hearing.

Judge Goldstone said Mrs Dundas offered Huxley lodging after he had been made an 'outcast' by his family due to his reliance on drink and drugs.

'Within less than 24 hours you were to repay that kindness and common decency in a way which was as inhuman as it was gratuitously violent,' Judge Goldstone said.

The judge said that on the night he had been welcomed into the victim’s home the defendant did not go to bed.

'Instead you searched Janis Dundas’s 
computer for hardcore pornographic websites - not just any hardcore 
pornographic websites, but those which in some respects were able to 
satisfy an interest in sexual activity between young men and women of a 
mature age,' he said.

The
court heard that earlier that day, April 4, the defendant carried out 
the same searches on his own laptop as well as using the victim’s 
computer to carry out more porn searches of that nature after he had 
murdered her.

Judge Goldstone said: 'I am sure that on that night you spent some considerable time on such websites... in order to arouse yourself sexually with a view to having intercourse with her.'

The judge said he was 'in no doubt whatsoever' that Huxley not only planned to have sex with his step- grandmother but that he did have penetrative sex with her that night.

He added: 'I am sure that, in fact, your sexual assault upon her began and continued either whilst she was asleep or not responding.'

He said one of the reasons he carried out the assault was his apparent inability to form a sexual relationship or any meaningful relationship with a girl of his own age.

The court heard that after the sexual assault Huxley armed himself with four kitchen knives and a skewer and went on to murder and mutilate his step-grandmother.

The judge said only Huxley knew why he had murdered Mrs Dundas but he said there could only be two reasons: 'Either you were so frustrated by the unsatisfactory sex that had taken place, or you were so disgusted by what you had done that you decided, there and then, to kill her.'

After the sentencing, Jessica Knight, Mrs Dundas’s daughter, said: 'She was a mummy, a grandmother, sister and daughter, a clever and insightful woman murdered so brutally by a man she had invited into her home.

'Her murder has left a deep and dark hole in our lives. The sentence imposed in some ways reflects the gravity of this crime and gives us some consolation.'

She added: 'Our wonderful life has been shattered and all we can now do is try not to let the incomprehensible actions of one man become our focus.

'Instead, we will try to rejoice in the memories we have of a truly wonderful woman, our beautiful mummy.'
