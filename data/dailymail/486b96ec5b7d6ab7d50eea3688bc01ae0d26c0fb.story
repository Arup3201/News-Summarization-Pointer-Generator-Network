Ignoring the figures: Labour's Harriet Harman

Households will see a ‘substantial boost to their spending power’ this year, a major report reveals today.

Wages are set to surge ahead of prices as workers feel the benefit of the growing economy.

The predictions by economists at influential think tank Item Club undermine Labour’s campaign on the cost of living.

Yesterday the party’s deputy leader Harriet Harman raised the issue eight times in a TV interview as she argued ordinary people are not feeling better off.

She declared that Barack Obama was ‘wrong’ last week to praise Britain’s economic recovery when he said it showed the UK Government ‘must be doing something right’.

And she told Andrew Neil on BBC’s Sunday Politics: ‘That growth is not being felt by people, and it’s a recovery that’s being accompanied by stagnation in living standards and that’s why we’re saying that people are no better off – the recovery hasn’t reached their front door.’

But her claims appear to be undermined by forecasts of a buoyant economy, growing wages and falling prices.

Item Club’s experts say that real disposable incomes, which take inflation into account, are expected to rise by 3.7 per cent this year, while interest rates are set to stay at 0.5 per cent until 2016.

This will ease pressure on overstretched borrowers, although it will prolong the agony of low returns for savers.

Meanwhile, inflation will average ‘around zero’ in 2015, with the economy growing by 2.9 per cent – considerably better than the 2.4 per cent predicted just three months ago.

Later this week, figures to be published by the Office for National Statistics are expected to show that wages are rising nearly four times faster than prices.

They should also reveal that average earnings, excluding bonuses, are nearly 2 per cent higher than a year ago.

This means that pay is now rising substantially faster than inflation, which has crashed to a record low of 0.5 per cent on the back of falling food and fuel prices.

The Item Club’s report states that the UK is ‘a clear winner’ of the oil-price slump from $115 a barrel last June to less than $50 in recent days.

Its chief economic advisor Peter Spencer says the lower price will provide ‘a shot in the arm’ for British households, ‘who are set to benefit from a substantial boost to their spending power’.

He went on: ‘Not every economy will be a winner from oil prices collapsing but the UK certainly is.

‘We have described the previous weakness of commodity prices as a silver lining in the storm clouds gathering over the world economy. But with oil prices now down over 50 per cent since last June, this silver lining has turned to gold.’

Chancellor George Osborne has hailed the report as ‘further proof’ that the Government’s economic plan is working.

‘But the job is not yet done, and so we must keep working through our plan that is securing a better economic future,’ he added.

Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander urged companies to pass on price cuts to consumers. ‘Falling oil prices act like a giant tax cut to the economy and will further boost our already established recovery,’ he said.

‘But the full benefits will only be felt if every last penny of the oil price fall is passed on to consumers – in full and quickly.

‘Consumers felt the pain when oil prices were high. It’s only fair that they, and the economy, should feel the full benefit when they’re falling.’

In Item Club’s report, Mr Spencer says the falling oil prices ‘come just as the recovery was losing momentum, and will move the game up to a higher level for a year or two.

‘The UK consumer has been lashed by rising fuel and food prices for so long, but is now the major beneficiary as these pull back.

‘So far, the recovery in our incomes has been driven by larger numbers entering work while earnings have been falling. But now, individuals can look forward to a substantial increase in real earnings.’
