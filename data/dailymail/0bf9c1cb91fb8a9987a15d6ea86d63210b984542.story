The beginning of her pregnancy wasn’t easy, to say the least.

But six months in, the Duchess of Cambridge is blooming – and seems to be taking full advantage of her radiant health.

Kate has undertaken no fewer than five public engagements in eight days, giving a masterclass in the art of maternity dressing along the way.

Radiant: The Duchess of Cambridge was wearing a peach £375 Tara Jarmon coat yesterday

Yesterday the duchess completed her busy week with a visit to a children’s hospice in Hampshire. Sadly Prince William wasn’t by her side, despite it being the couple’s second wedding anniversary.

The duchess, 31, blushed when she was asked whether William was taking her out for the occasion, explaining that he was on duty as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot in Anglesey, North Wales.

Professor Khalid Aziz, chairman of trustees at Naomi House Children’s Hospice near Winchester, told Kate: ‘It’s especially special that you came here today because … two years ago to the day, you were in a slightly larger building than this one – probably not having quite as much fun.

‘But you did it very well, we were all totally enthralled. I just hope Prince William is taking you somewhere nice tonight.’

All dressed up: On April 21, Kate was smart in a £1,750 Mulberry coat and £99 Whiteley hat in Windsor and two days later she went for a £1,065 Erdem dress and £350 Prada heels for trip to Manchester

Bumping along: Back in London on April 24 she went designer in an Emilia Wickstead dress estimated to cost £2,500, but followed up on April 26 with a £38 Topshop dress and £800 Ralph Lauren jacket

At this, the duchess blushed bright red and opened her arms expressively. ‘Well he’s on shift, so …’, she trailed off.

But she was delighted when he gave her an anniversary present from the hospice’s children, in the form of a framed picture of the Very Hungry Caterpillar featuring all their fingerprints.

The picture, from the classic children’s book, was on cotton – the traditional symbol for a second wedding anniversary.

Kate, who met some of the hospice’s children and their parents at a tea party, wore a £375 apricot coloured Tara Jarmon coat, teamed with a peach dress made by her personal dressmaker and her favourite nude LK Bennett heels.

Loving touch, just like Diana: The Duchess of Cambridge seems to have the same ability to charm children as Princess Diana, pictured in Sao Paulo in 1996

It was a perfectly peachy ending to a week of impeccable fashion choices, which revealed Kate’s growing baby bump.

First up was a mint green Mulberry coat for a trip to Windsor for the Queen’s Scouts Awards last Sunday.

On Tuesday she chose an Erdem silk floral dress as she headed to the Wythenshawe Estate in Manchester, while on Wednesday she dressed perfectly for a warm evening at the National Portrait Gallery in London in a bespoke Emilia Wickstead baby blue cocktail dress.

And she showed her thrifty credentials on Friday, wearing a £38 Topshop dress for a tour of the Harry Potter experience in Hertfordshire with William and Prince Harry.

It is believed Kate and William enjoyed a private weekend away in Norfolk to mark their anniversary.
