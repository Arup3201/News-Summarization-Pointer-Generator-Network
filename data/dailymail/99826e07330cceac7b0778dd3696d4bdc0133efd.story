A display showing mannequins of
pregnant schoolgirls at a Caracas mall is shocking shoppers and
stirring debate over sex education in Venezuela.

Two local charities have dressed up three mannequins behind
a shop window as girls with bulging stomachs under the blue
uniforms used by schoolchildren here until age 15.

The idea is to draw attention to an adolescent pregnancy
rate they say is one of the worst in South America with one girl
under-18 becoming pregnant every three minutes and 23 percent of
all births coming in that age category.

'I think it's horrible, awful. If I was a mother, I wouldn't
want my child to see that,' said scandalised student Kelly
Hernandez, 18, clasping her hand over her mouth as she took a
double-take at the display on Wednesday.

Her friend Auriselvia Torrealba, 20, was more sympathetic,
seeing a higher purpose to the shock campaign.

'Yes, it's disturbing to see in a window. But it's the
truth. You see pregnant girls all the time on the streets. So
this forces you to think about the problem, doesn't it?'

While Venezuela's socialist government says education and
children's rights have improved enormously during its 15 years
in power, non-governmental agencies say sex education needs to
be improved and parents need to take the subject more seriously.

The two children's charities behind the campaign, Fundana
and Construyendo Futuros, are delighted with the controversy and
publicity around their display.

'It's amazing seeing people react as they walk by. This is
such a taboo subject in Venezuela, we want people to talk about
it,' Construyendo Futuros president Thalma Cohen said. 'Some
people get angry and complain. Others congratulate us.'

The display runs for a month and may be extended to other
malls around the nation of 30 million people.

It comes days after a United Nations women's rights watchdog
expressed 'deep concern' to Venezuela about the high number of
teenage pregnancies and associated maternal mortality.

According to the most recent U.N. data, Venezuela had an
adolescent birth rate of 101 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 19, one
of the highest in Latin America, in 2010.

Maternal mortality was 92 per 100,000 live births, which is
around mid-range for the region.
