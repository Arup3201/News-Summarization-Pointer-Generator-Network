She was a happy and delightful toddler whose life was brutally cut short.

Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe was 21 months old when she was found dying in her cot from head injuries. Experts agree the injuries ‘must have been deliberate’.

But after a 15-month police inquiry, the Crown Prosecution Service refused to charge any of the family members arrested over her death because of ‘insufficient evidence’.

The decision infuriated Summer’s father and grandparents who have spoken out to demand ‘justice’ for the innocent little girl.

Loss: Toddler Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe was found in her cot with fatal head injuries. Police have yet to charge anyone in connection with her death

Plumber Joss Ratcliffe, 24, who lost his only child, said: ‘This should go to a jury to decide. If a child is killed in her house and they know who was looking after her then it should at least go to trial.’

Summer was found unwell in her cot by her grandmother at 8.30am on February 27 last year, after the mother and her boyfriend had left their Dewsbury home separately for work. Susan Rogers, 57, dialled 999 but Summer died in the local hospital’s intensive care unit.

Her mother Victoria Rogers, 26, boyfriend Craig Sharp, 34, and Mrs Rogers were arrested on suspicion of murder, but have been released from police bail.

Miss Rogers insists she wants ‘justice’ for her daughter and claims to have ‘begged’ prosecutors to charge both her and her now ex-boyfriend so a jury can decide the truth.

Experts said the fatal injuries were likely to have been inflicted within 12 to 24 hours before Summer died. Murder and manslaughter charges were rejected because detectives couldn’t prove ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ who caused the injuries.

An offence of ‘causing or allowing the death of a child’ was also ruled out because the CPS said the charge required a ‘history of serious violence towards Summer’ to be established.

The CPS said: ‘There is no evidence of a history of serious harm having been caused to Summer by any of the suspects nor was there any reason for the need to protect her.’

But Summer’s father and his parents disagree and say the authorities played down previous incidents of alleged physical abuse. Summer was taken to hospital with serious burns to her hand 11 months before her death. Miss Rogers could not explain the injury.

The toddler’s paternal grandmother Deborah Ratcliffe, 49, a school finance officer, phoned the health visitor to express concerns about the burn and an unexplained bruise to Summer’s ear a few weeks earlier.

Mrs Ratcliffe, from Dewsbury, told the Mail: ‘We can’t just let our granddaughter be murdered and get a letter from the CPS to say “I’m sorry, there’s nothing we can do”, and get on with our lives as if nothing has happened.

‘We want justice for Summer.’

Miss Rogers told police Summer was well when she left at 6am. Mr Sharp said the girl was asleep when he left at 7.40am. Mrs Rogers, a retired nurse, told police Summer appeared to be asleep when she checked on her between 7.45 and 8.30am, when she found her unwell.

Miss Rogers told the Mail she was ‘absolutely disgusted’ at the CPS decision. She said: ‘I have done nothing wrong. I want justice for her more than anybody else.’

Mr Sharp added: ‘I was upset with the police not bringing charges. I want the truth to come out.’

A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘The investigation remains open pending any new evidence.’
