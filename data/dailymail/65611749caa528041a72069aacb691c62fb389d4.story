Bookie Paddy Power has provoked outrage by taking bets on the Oscar Pistorius trialâ€™s outcome and offering to refund punters if he is cleared.

The advert features a photograph of Pistorius, a double amputee Olympic racer and a Paralympic gold medallist, mocked up as an Academy Award statuette.

It states: 'It's Oscar Time. Money Back If He Walks. We will refund all losing bets on the Oscar Pistorius trial if he is found not guilty.'

Growing protests have branded it as 'sick' and produced calls for any money raised so far to be donated to groups which tackle violence against women.

It coincides with the Oscar ceremony in Los Angeles and the first day of Pistorius' trial in South Africa where he formally pleaded not guilty to four charges including the murder of Reeva Steenkamp.

By 1.50pm today 1,190 people, and counting, had signed a change.org online petition demanding that Paddy Power 'please remove your offensive betting on the outcome of the Oscar Pistorius trial and donate any profits so far to a women's charity fighting violence against women'.

Holly Dustin, director of End Violence Against Women, said: 'They are making a game out of murder and the brutal killing of a young woman which is unacceptable.

'It is not just that this is a bit sick - it also actually contributes to a culture in which violence against women is trivialised or made into a bit of a joke.

'This a really serious problem. It is recognised as a human rights issue both here in the UK and in South Africa. It is totally unacceptable. They should withdraw the add.'

Paddy Power, after whom the bookmakers is named, said the firm have 'no intention at the moment' of taking the advert down.

He said: 'It is so high profile which means there is more talk about it and it is being talked about in every pub. People are talking about this . It is top of the agenda. It is in everyone's face. Everyone is interested and intrigued.

'We are not offering on it not because it is a murder trial, we are offering odds because it is a huge global event which just happens to be a murder trial.'
