Mindy McCready is the fifth former contestant on 'Celebrity Rehab' who died within three years of appearing on the television show.

Since the country star was found after an apparent suicide at her cabin in Arkansas, the reality show that she starred in has come under increased scrutiny.

However, McCready herself was possibly under scrutiny at the time of her death. Police were reportedly planning question her about the death last month of her boyfriend David Wilson, who was shot at the same Heber Spring, Arkansas, home where McCready killed herself.

'Celebrity Rehab,' which is currently in its fifth season on VH1, is lead by Dr Drew Pinsky and features a changing cast of celebrities. Camera chronicle their journey through a 21-day rehabilitation clinic where they are treated for various drug addictions.

Addiction: Country singer Mindy McCready is the fifth former Celebrity Rehab contestant to die in the years after their appearance on the reality show

Tragic: Mindy McCready, 37, killed herself on the same front porch where her 'soulmate' David Wilson died on January 13

In addition to 37-year-old McCready, four other castmates have died because of different incidents relating to their addictions.

The most fatal of the show's seasons was the third season, since McCready's death brings the fatality count up to three out of the nine featured cast members.

It was revealed on Monday that McCready had been working on a suicide awareness video right before her death, it was revealed today.

Private investigator Danno Hanks told E! News the 37-year-old had asked him to work on a cover of I'll See You Yesterday which was written by Courtney Dashe, a fan of McCready's who wanted her to sing the song.

Then on Saturday, the day before she was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at her Arkansas home, she sent him a frame for a video with a suicide hotline number.

Mike Starr, a former bassist for the 
grunge rock band Alice in Chains, was the first 'Celebrity Rehab' star 
to die after his appearance on the show.

Starr appeared on the show in 2009 in its third season.

He admitted to being addicted to heroin, methadone, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana.

In February 2011, Starr was arrested for possessing two kinds of painkillers without a prescription.

One
month later, on March 8, 2011, he was found dead at his Salt Lake City,
Utah, home. Dr Drew Pinsky described his death as a 'prescription drug 
overdose.'

He was 44.

Jeff Conaway made a name for himself in 'Grease,' where he played Kenickie.

He
appeared on season one of 'Celebrity Rehab' in 2008 in an attempt to 
overcome his addiction to alcohol, cocaine and prescription drugs.

He also appeared in the second season of the show, after he relapsed following back surgery.

On
May 11, 2011, Conaway was found unconscious at his home in Encino, 
California. Doctors said he was in coma after suffering from pneumonia 
with sepsis, which was made worse by his years of drug abuse.

Two weeks later, his family took him off life support.

He died at age 60.

 

Rodney King became a celebrity after 
he his brutal beating by LAPD cops was caught on tape. Their acquittal 
resulted in the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

King appeared on 'Celebrity Rehab' in 2008 to cope with long-term alcoholism.

He also had a history of drug abuse.

He
also appeared on 'Sober House' and continued to appear on Dr Drew's 
programs as he worked through his substance addictions and trauma from 
being battered by police.

On June 17, 2012, he was found lying at the bottom of his swimming pool in Rialto, California.

An autopsy found alcohol, marijuana and cocaine in his system.

He was 47.

Joy Kovar's drug an alcohol addiction 
became so pronounced during his run on MTV's 'Real World' that he was 
kicked off the show in 2008.

He joined season three of 'Celebrity Rehab,' which aired in 2010. 

On the show, he admitted to abusing alcohol, cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamine and steroids.

His family said he remained clean for six months while he pursued an acting career.

On August 17, 2012, he was found dead in an apartment in Chicago.

Reports
from the time say he died of a suspected drug overdose after drinking 
heavily and taking cocaine and Viagra the night before.

 

He said: 'She said she wanted to put 
together this video to help people deal when someone had suffered a 
suicide in their life and God, she was literally having me write her 
suicide note.

If I had known, I would have made 
sure someone was there with her all the time. I thought she was talking 
about sending a message about suicide for David's death but this is 
unbelievable.

'She was sending me a message. I wish I had been more alert to what it 
was. I just didn't think she would do this. She had two kids to live 
for. I still can't fathom the whole thing.'

McCready was also facing public scrutiny over the death of Wilson on January 13,

Sheriff's deputies investigating the case had said the death was suspicious. They were planning to re-interview before she died, People magazine reports.

Treatment: Dr Drew Pinsky is the head of the show and he said that he was 'saddened' by McCready's death

McCready denied having anything to do with his death - calling David Wilson her 
'soulmate' - but police said unanswered questions remain.

'At first, she said she hadn't heard the gunshot because the TV was too loud. Then she said she had heard the gunshot,' a source told People.

'So obviously there were a lot of questions, and the Sheriff was asking for clarification.'

Former Real World contestant Joey 
Kovar died in August of last year, just three years after the third 
season of Celebrity Rehab aired.

Though his family said that he had maintained his sobriety following the show, an autopsy revealed that his cause of death was opiate intoxication.

That is believed to be a result of the 
painkiller that he was taking at the time, which was called Norco and 
classified as an opiate though it was never confirmed that the drug 
caused his death.

Their fellow cast mate Mike Starr, a 
bass player from the grunge rock band Alice in Chains, was arrested in 
February 2011 for possessing two different types of prescription 
medication that were deemed controlled substances.

He was found dead less than a month later as a result of what Dr Drew deemed a prescription drug overdose.

The
two other stars who died after their series aired were actor Jeff 
Conaway of Grease fame and Rodney King, the man whose beating sparked 
the Los Angeles police brutality riots.

Conaway,
who made a name for himself as Kenickie in the musical film, was 
featured on both the show's first and second seasons because his 
addiction to prescription medication returned following back surgeries.

At first it was thought that he died in 
May 2011 due to a drug overdose, but Dr Drew later made a public 
statement saying that he was placed in a medically induced coma 
following a combination of pneumonia and sepsis caused by years of drug 
abuse.

King, who shot to fame after he was 
seen being beaten by police in Los Angeles which went on to prompt the 
infamous riots of the early 1990s, was found dead after having drowned 
in his swimming pool.

The 
drowning was ruled an accident but an autopsy proved that he had a mix 
of cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol in his system at the time of his 
death in June of last year.

Now much of the criticism is falling 
on the shoulders of Dr Drew Pinsky who serves as a host, executive 
producer and doctor on the show.

Reflections: Mackenzie Phillips, one of the six remaining cast members from season three of Celebrity Rehab, posted a message to Twitter shortly after the news of McCready's suicide was released

'Although
I have not treated her for a few years, I had reached out to her 
recently upon hearing about the apparent suicide of her boyfriend and 
father of her younger children. She was devastated,' he said in a 
statement Monday.

'Although
she was fearful of stigma and ridicule she agreed with me that she 
needed to make her health and safety a priority. Unfortunately it seems 
that Mindy did not sustain her treatment.'

McCready had been in the news over 
the past month because her live-in boyfriend also died in an apparent 
suicide at the same cabin in Heber Springs.

McCready
was allegedly in the house at the time of his death but she allegedly 
did not hear the gun shot because the television was too loud.

Following Wilson's death, she attended court-ordered rehab and her two sons were put into foster care, and they remained in the custody of the state at the time of her death.

On her bio page from Celebrity Rehab's website, VH1 made references to her personal problems and even pegged the root of her troubles on her relationships.

Her biography on the show's page says: 'Although she was arrested and jailed for trying to buy OxyContin with a false prescription and attempted suicide with an overdose of drugs and alcohol, Mindy believes her only true addiction is to violent relationships.'
