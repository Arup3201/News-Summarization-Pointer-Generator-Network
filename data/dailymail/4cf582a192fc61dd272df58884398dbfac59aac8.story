A massive riot involving as many as 60 students and their parents broke out at a Pittsburgh school bus stop after class on Monday and then the mob met again on Tuesday to continue the fight.

Cell phone video captured the shocking incident, which began with a crowd of teenagers fighting in the streets of Swissvale after school when their parents joined in.

Police have already arrested five adults and minors allegedly involved in the beatdown, and are looking for close to a dozen more.
