Neil Warnock has called on the FA to be more consistent in its treatment of managers, claiming some of his colleagues escape sanction for offences that would land him in trouble.

The Crystal Palace manager was on Thursday charged for his stinging criticism of referee Craig Pawson last Saturday, with the FA accusing him of implying ‘the match referee was motivated by bias’.

Warnock has insisted that his intention was to question Pawson’s experience and not his integrity, when he said at the weekend that the 35-year-old official had been ‘influenced’ by Chelsea’s players during Palace’s 2-1 defeat.

But the FA have taken a dimmer view and given the veteran manager until 6pm on Monday to answer the charge.

The charge came almost immediately after Warnock finished his weekly press briefing, in which he suggested the rules regarding post-match comments are not evenly applied.

He said: ‘The only thing I think managers would ask for is consistency, really. There’s been incidents over the last couple of weeks that if it was Neil Warnock, I might have been charged. So you do look from afar and wonder how they arrive at certain aspects of the charges.

‘They have one of two people full-time just looking at comments so they’ve got to earn their wages. I think somebody has to look at what’s said because I think certain comments are out of order.

‘But I have seen managers say things that I thought were way out of order over the last few years and they haven’t had a charge. So it’s difficult to understand how they come about the charges. I don’t think we know really how they do it to this day.’

Warnock added: ‘I don’t think they go after me, I think they look at everything individually. I just think that when I look at the comments people make and don’t get charges, it surprises me and I think if I’d made similar comments, I probably would have got a charge. It’s confusing.’
