Brian Williams may be off the air, but it seems NBC's problems are far from over. 

Ratings for the network's Nightly News broadcast dipped by double-digits on Wednesday during its first broadcast that had suspended anchor Brian Williams' name stripped from the title.

Nielsen's 'fast affiliate numbers' revealed that the nightly telecast's 9.8million viewers from Monday night had slipped to 8.6million by Thursday in what turned out to be its lowest numbers of the week.

Williams received a six-month unpaid suspension this week after it was revealed the anchor falsely claimed he was inside a helicopter that came under fire during a mission in Iraq.

Weekend anchor Lester Holt has temporarily taken his place. 

Nightly News lost nearly 400,000 viewers on Wednesday to ABC's competing World News Tonight,  a complete reverse in the Nielsen numbers from just last week, according to Deadline. 

And only two weeks ago, NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams had more than 600,000 viewers than the ABC news program.

World News Tonight has only beaten Nightly News 10 times in the ratings since September, when David Muir took over the anchor chair for Diane Sawyer, according to Mediaite.  

But early numbers show ABC also beat NBC this past Thursday, hinting at a possible reverse in their viewer fortune.

The loss would be a huge blow to NBC, whose Today Show is already losing the daytime battle to ABC's Good Morning America. 

And the network's former star anchor's credibility only continues to be questioned as a number of his stories, including seeing a dead body floating by during Hurricane Katrina and his presence at the fall of the Berlin Wall, are being investigated.

Lester Holt directly addressed the controversy in Wednesday night's broadcast, reporting statements made by NBC chiefs before promising the audience 'we will work every night to be worthy of your trust'.   

In his statement, NBC chief executive Stephen Burke wrote:

'By his actions, Brian has jeopardized the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News. His actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate. 

NBC chief executive Stephen Burke said the suspension was 'severe and appropriate', but a number of  viewers voiced their disappointment with the punishment on the Nightly News Facebook page

Many viewers said NBC should have given Williams a second chance. Others said they wouldn't be watching the show until Williams returned and wrote they'd switched the channel to ABC instead 

Williams had removed himself from the show for several days before NBC decided to hand down their own punishment.

At least one former NBC News employee, who spoke to The Daily Beast anonymously, was shocked at the severe discipline.

'I'm flabbergasted, to be honest,' they said. 'What NBC just did, by handing down this kind of six-month sentence, really prevents Brian from redeeming himself in any kind of expedient way.'

And there are a number of Nightly News fans who seem to agree. 

When the network posted a photo of the stripped-down Nightly News logo on their Facebook and asked East Coast viewers to comment if they were watching, a number of users admitted to missing Williams and demanded his return. 

One user wrote the hashtag #BringBrianBack, which got over 400 likes. 

Another fan said: 'I like and respect Lester but am going through Brian Williams withdrawals. Give him a second chance. That's what we like here right? Redemption, second chances.' 

And one commenter wrote: 'See you in six months.' 

Williams, 55, had been the anchor for Nightly News for 10 years prior to his suspension. 

He has so far declined to comment on the incident since an on-air apology and is not allowed to make appearances without the approval of NBC.

Scandal: The newest allegations are concerning for Williams (pictured arriving for his appearance on Letterman's show in 2013) who is already facing an investigation by NBC News 

Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s

In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies.

In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up.

A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone 'stuck a .38-caliber in my face'.

Berlin Wall, 1989  

Tom Brokaw was historically the only American anchor present at the fall of the Berlin Wall. 

But during a 2008 forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Williams claimed he was at the Brandenburg gate 'the night the wall came down.' 

And although in a 2004 interview Williams said he arrived at the wall 'a day after -- more like 12 hours after -- Tom Brokaw did,' at a gala in 2014 he stated: '25 years ago tonight Tom Brokaw and I were at the Berlin Wall'.   

Iraq War, 2003

Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003.

Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present.

Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.'

Hurricane Katrina, 2005

Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans.

He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded.

The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was 'overrun' with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster.

Israel, 2006

In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel.

In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'.

Boston, 2006

A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live.

On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.
