Police in Northern Ireland have escaped injury after a bomb in a bin exploded.

Officers were investigating reports of an illegal parade in Lurgan, Co Armagh, when the device went off near a primary school this afternoon.

There were no reports of any injuries in the attack which was condemned as 'callous'.

Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness described those responsible as anti-peace extremists who were living in a fantasy world.

'Bomb in Lurgan has to be condemned. Anti peace extremist living in a fantasy world. Attack futile. Won't change a thing. No going back,' said Mr McGuinness via Twitter.

The no-warning explosion happened at about 3pm at the junction of North Circular Road and Levin Road.

The finger of blame has been pointed towards dissident republicans who have been behind a number of shootings and bombings in recent weeks.

John O'Dowd, Sinn Fein MLA in Lurgan, described the attack as stupid and said it was fortunate that police or locals were not hurt.

'Thankfully no-one was injured. They had a very, very lucky escape. The bin was completely destroyed and if anyone had been near it they would have been maimed or killed.

'Those who planted this device showed no regard for the local community, for the police or for the supporters who were watching the Easter parade.

'These so-called dissidents need to come out and explain exactly why they are doing this. The planting of this device along a busy road on one of the busiest days of the year was not only callous it was stupid,' Mr O'Dowd said.

Last week, the dissidents - who have murdered two soldiers, two policemen and a prison guard in their campaign of violence - were blamed for abandoning a bomb close to the venue for the G8 summit in Co Fermanagh.

Earlier this month, three police officers escaped injury when an explosive device detonated within metres of them as they patrolled a coastal path on the outskirts of Belfast.

A mortar-type device was also discovered aimed towards a police station in north Belfast.

In Londonderry, two men were arrested when police intercepted a van carrying four mortar bombs which were primed and ready to fire at Strand Road police station.

SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly, who sat on the Stormont justice committee, described this latest bomb bid as reckless.

'It was a callous act by people who showed scant regard for the local community. We can only be thankful that no one has been injured.

'It just shows that even at this holiday time people must be vigilant. This is not where we thought we would be 15 years after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement,' she said.

Police have described the explosion, which occurred close to a primary school, as small and said it caused minor damage.

A PSNI spokesman said investigations were continuing.
