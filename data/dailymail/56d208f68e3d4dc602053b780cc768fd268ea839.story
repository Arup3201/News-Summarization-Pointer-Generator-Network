With years of training required to become an itamae - a traditional Japanese chef - it's not surprising that food is something of an art in Japan.

But one creative cook has taken her technique even further - by literally creating 'sushi artworks'.

Tama-chan - otherwise known as llustrator Takayo Chioyta - shapes her rice and seaweed rolls into aÂ  range of designs, from bite-sized cartoons of cats and flowers, to copies of famous portraits such as Vermeer's Girl With A Pearl Earring and Edvard Munch's The Scream.

The Tokyo chef uses food dye, soy sauce and green wasabi to colour the rice to make her 'makizushi' or 'rolled sushi' creations.

In traditional fashion, seaweed, rice and other ingredients - such as raw fish, ginger and vegetables - are laid out on a bamboo mat to be rolled up into one cylindrical wrap, ready to be cut into six or eight pieces.

This is when Tama-chan lines up the components of her own makizushi, visualising how the cross-sections will look when everything is sliced up.

'I never know what the inside looks like so I'm never sure if it will come out the way I imagined,' the artist wrote. 'And I can't make edits when I'm done.

'Facial expressions are especially difficult because small ingredients or putting on too much force when you're wrapping the rolls can completely throw things off.

'It's always a special moment when I make the first incision to reveal an image.'

On her kookily-named website 'Sushi 
smile of Tama-chan', the ]artist describes her mission to 'encourage
food education and enjoyment and get people to communicate' through her
fun food.

'When you see 
that roll of rice, the thrill and excitement of not knowing what that 
picture will look like until you cut it is unbearable!' she promises.

Traditionally, Japanese sushi chefs train for up to 20 years - although shorter apprenticeships are more common in less exclusive restaurants, particularly outside Japan.

An itamae - which translates as 'in front of the board' - needs to know the correct etiquette around customers, how to move about the kitchen and how to handle utensils.

Knowing by sight whether the raw fish is safe to eat or not is also a key skill.

It
takes around five years of training for an apprentice chef to be 
allowed to prepare the rice to the restaurant's particular recipe.

They then graduate to 'wakiita' level 
('near the cutting board'), with the duty of preparing fresh 
ingredients, before becoming a fully-fledged itamae.

But
Tama-chan has set up workshops offering Tokyo residents the chance to 
watch her make her sushi artworks and have a go under her watchful eye.

The sushi designer also offers courses in English to give foreigners the chance to prove their credentials as the next rice Rembrandt.
