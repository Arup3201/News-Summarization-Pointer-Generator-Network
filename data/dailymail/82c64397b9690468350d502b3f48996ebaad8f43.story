Louis van Gaal is preparing to take over as manager at Manchester United next season - even though United say that they have yet to make a final decision.

After detailed talks last week, the current Holland manager believes he has a verbal agreement to take over from David Moyes and is planning to ask Patrick Kluivert and current stand-in manager Ryan Giggs to be his assistants.

United insist that talk of an agreement is premature and no contracts have yet been signed. And after Giggs masterminded a 4-0 win over Norwich in his first game as caretaker manager, Wayne Rooney insisted the United legend had ‘all the credentials’ to take the job on a permanent basis.

But though United do not wish to be rushed into making an announcement, Van Gaal is ahead of other candidates in that he is able to negotiate freely.

Kluivert knows Van Gaal well having played under him at Ajax, Barcelona and Holland and is currently one of his assistants for the Dutch national side.

In an interview with Talksport the former striker said Van Gaal has the mentality and experience to take United back among the elite having managed at the top before.

'He would be absolutely the first pick of any club, especially top teams everywhere in the world,' Kluivert said.

'He likes to let young players make their debut if ready for it. The most important thing at the moment is I'm personally enjoying working with him and with the Dutch national team. We're going to the World Cup and hope to do well.

'After that we'll see what happens and with me as well.

'Sure I would [do the job] wherever in the world because I love working with him. It doesn't matter what club it will be if he asks me to join him, I would be absolutely honoured to be on his side.'

Carlo Ancelotti is coming to the climax of the season with Real Madrid and it is unclear whether Real president Florentino Perez would be prepared to let him go.

Van Gaal wants to bring goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek, physiotherapist Jos van Dijk and analyst Max Reekers as well as former Holland striker Kluivert but also wants Giggs on his team - and would be happy to work with the likes of Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt.

Giggs was given a standing ovation on Saturday as he took charge of United for the first time, just five days after Moyes was fired. And he couldn’t have asked for a better start to his caretaker reign, with Rooney and Juan Mata each scoring twice.

FOUND HIM! Louis gets away from all the fuss with a quiet round of golf

While, as Manchester United were casting their net wide to find the next manager at Old Trafford, Van Gaal, was fishing his golf ball out of the water, seemingly without a care in the world.  

Van Gaal has been hiding at his holiday home at Vale Do Lobo, a 500-hectare luxury resort on Portugal’s Algarve coast, with hundreds of villas, 15 restaurants, two golf courses, a supermarket and a nightclub.

The 61-year-old has a villa here. It is, as you might expect, at the top end of the price scale, having large balconies with sea views. It also overlooks the first green of the Ocean Golf Course, where he plays as often as he can.

Van Gaal does not take kindly to people showing up on his doorstep unannounced, although presumably United’s representatives would have been more than welcome. After two days searching for the most coveted manager in English football, I finally find him when a silver 4x4 pulls up on one of the plushest streets in the resort, where properties cost upwards of €2million.

Van Gaal appears from the rear seats together with his wife, Truus. Wearing a pale pink shirt, smart trousers and oversized sunglasses, he turns to say goodbye to the English couple who have dropped them off and reluctantly shakes my hand. 

The house on the sprawling plot next to Van Gaal’s has been knocked down and a new one is being built. Van Gaal has red cement dust blowing in his face and my introductions are muffled by the noise of a digger.

Can I have a quick word, Louis? ‘No!’ he scowls. But can we expect to see you in England next season? No response. Do you think you’ll go to United? ‘I’m sorry I can’t talk about it.’ Why not, Louis? ‘I can’t say anything because everything I say will be interpreted as what they want. The Press are here and it’s not nice because I’m here for holidays and it’s my last week before the World Cup.’

And with that, Van Gaal disappears behind the iron gates of his property.

Nice people: One waiter said Van Gaal is very serious but 'not too picky, not too demanding'

He is well known around the resort. He is regarded as a ‘good tipper’ at the Breeze Cafe and he and his family are also popular customers at the Teahouse Oriental Restaurant. In the summer months, he requests a table overlooking the sea and orders his favourite dish, crispy aromatic duck, at a slightly pricey €19.50. 

‘He is very serious,’ said a waiter, ‘but they’re very nice people, not too picky, not too demanding.’

Whether United’s squad find him quite so undemanding, should he get the Old Trafford job, remains to be seen.
