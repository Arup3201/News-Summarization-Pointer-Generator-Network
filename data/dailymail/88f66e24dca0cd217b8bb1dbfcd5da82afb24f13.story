They slept, read books, went shopping at the supermarket and may have even gone on an excursion to the library together. 

The father of Michelle Levy, the 11-year-old North Bondi girl who went missing from the family's Glenayr Avenue home for 40 hours at the weekend, has revealed how his daughter spent her time on the run in the company of a stranger. 

But Adam Levy, 40, said the family still have little idea about the identity of the 50-year-old man who befriended Michelle and provided her with shelter.

The Year Five student spent two nights in a Randwick flat with the older man, who she met in Bondi Junction shortly after leaving her home on Saturday.

Michelle was found 'safe and well' on Monday morning after the man got in contact with the charity Anglicare. 

The man has been questioned by police but he was not arrested and was released without charge.

Mr Levy also revealed Michelle insisted on returning to her school, Woollahra Public School, 'really late' on Monday afternoon where she saw her best friends, who were pulled from class to greet her. 

Outside the family home, Mr Levy said that while he would like to thank the man who cared for his daughter, he did not know much about him and the family doubted the police would tell them his identity. 

'We don't know who he is any more more than the media do and we haven't asked, and I doubt the police would tell us even if we did,' Mr Levy said.

Police and paramedics visit the home of the man who provided shelter to 11-year-old runaway Michelle Levy

The visit to the man's home in Randwick, which is believed to be within a public housing block, was made due to concerns for his welfare

'It's entirely up to him if he wishes to talk with us.

'We'd be very happy to do so and to thank him for looking after her, but he would have to initiate that contact.'

Mr Levy said Michelle was taking the ordeal 'in her stride'.

He said the keen bookworm spent most of Sunday with her new friend reading a book, before the pair headed to a local supermarket, where they were spotted.

'I didn't ask her (what she was reading) but she reads voraciously, so it would have been a book that he had - or maybe they went to the library,' he said. 

Mr Levy said his daughter had told him some details about the man 'but I'm not going to repeat those.'

Police and paramedics were called to the man's Mulwarree Avenue home around midday on Tuesday out of concern for his welfare. 

Three police rescue officers and two paramedics attended the man's unit where Michelle Levy stayed

A Police Inspector said the man is 'not being investigated and would like to return to his normal life'

'He was concerned about media being out the front,' Inspector Steven Egbers said. 

'He's not being investigated and would like to return to his normal life.' 

Mr Levy said he believed the stranger had suggested that Michelle return to her parents' home multiple times over the weekend, but his daughter refused.

'She obviously didn't want to come home on Saturday night and clearly she still didn't want to come home on Sunday.

'The side effect of being well taken care of... is that there's not much compulsion to (go) home for safe haven, if you're being so well treated.'

'Not that I would have it any other way of course!'

'By Monday morning (the man) had persuaded her to get in contact with us.'

Ms Levy has a mobile phone but she did not take it with her when she fled the house. In addition, her phone battery was flat and she was out of credit.

When asked what his response was to many Australians who believed the whole ordeal was bizarre, Mr Levy told Daily Mail Australia: 'I mean if you're looking from the outside and you're not aware of any of the background circumstances it could look like any number of things.'

Mr Levy has said that Michelle left the family home after he had got into an row with his daughter over a chocolate bar.

Michelle appeared pleased while departing the family home to go to school on Tuesday morning. 

Mr Levy earlier described his daughter as 'chirpy' and said that she had run up to him and his wife Anne and 'given them a cuddle' when they were reunited. 

Mrs Levy said she was 'crying with joy' when she heard the good news and thanked the man who looked after her daughter.

Michelle Levy, who went missing after a 'family dispute' on Saturday, was found at an unknown older man's home

After being reunited with her parents and brother, Michelle said she had missed her parents.

But her brother cheekily replied: 'If you missed them why did you run away?' before quizzing her parents on whether she would be grounded. 

Mr Levy on Tuesday evening described revelations that he was charged with common assault on a young male earlier this month as 'frustrating'.

He is expected to appear at Waverley Local Court on November 20. 

Mr Levy has pledged to fight the charges.

This grainy image believed to show missing girl Michelle Levy, 11, emerged online on Sunday evening. It is said to have been taken outside Westfield Bondi Junction at 7pm Saturday, just half an hour after she left her home

Michelle's parents had made a number of appeals while searching for their daughter, saying that she should come home, was not in any trouble and had 'gone off in a sulk'.

'I wouldn't say she’s run away', Mr Levy said at the time. 

'She has sat on the front wall of the property once or twice. I don't think she's ever intended to leave home completely'. 

He said he wanted to tell his daughter: 'We love you. Everyone is worried about you.

'We just want you to be safe with your family. Come home as soon as you can. Be in touch and we'll come and get you.'  

Michelle left her home on Glenayr Avenue at North Bondi about 6.30pm on Saturday, was caught on CCTV near Westfield at Bondi Junction at 8pm on Saturday night, and was found at Randwick unit at 10.30am on Monday.

Missing posters (left) have been plastered around Sydney's eastern suburbs. Mr Levy said he hoped Michelle might take the opportunity to drop back home 'for supplies' so they have left a note on the front door (right)

The note reads: 'Michelle please come in we love you ring doorbell no matter what time'
