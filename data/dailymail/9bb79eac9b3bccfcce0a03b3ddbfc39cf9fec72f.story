A truck's dash cam has captured a commodore's miraculous crash escape after changing lanes and suddenly swerving out of control.

The 1.10 minute video begins with the truck driving on a busy Melbourne highway just before 11.00am on Thursday November 6.

Ed Sheeran's song 'Don't' starts playing in the background as the truck approaches a white commodore on the highway's far right lane. 

A truck's dash cam has captured a commodore's miraculous crash escape

The vehicle was changing lanes when it suddenly swerved out of control and his the median strip

The commodore indicates left before veering from the middle lane to the far left lane.

All of a sudden, the driver presumably  loses control of the car as it swerves from lane to lane until it spins completely out of control causing it to crash.

The car skidded all the way back to the right side of the highway and crashed front first in the median strip. 

As it flipped up in the air, the car's bonnet lifted and the vehicle did a complete 180, landing in the middle of the highway.

Luckily no other vehicles driving on the busy road collided with the flying car.

One woman and three young people scrambled out of the white commodore and the truck driver who caught the incident on his dash cam rushed to their aid.

A lady driving on the highway pulled over her car and ran across the highway to the four people involved in the accident.

Facebook page, Dash Cam Owners Australia, placed the video online on Sunday night.

'Nearly cleaned up 4 people in a commodore to my surprise thank god there was no baby in the baby seat.Tyres on the car where completely bald,' Dash Cam Owners Australia wrote.

'Thanks to Greg C... Good on ya for the quick reaction Greg and for being so quick to help.' 

Facebook users have commended the truck driver, with one insisting he should get 'Victorian of the year.'

Another person could not understand how the white car was able to get into such a horrific accident.

'I just can't comprehend in the first place who changes lanes on east link (let alone any motorway) in less than one car length in front and behind, of two trucks. And dart across a total of 3 full lanes 2 of which are completely blind,' Jay Stagoll wrote.
