We all know that Christmas jumper season is well and truly underway. But would you wear a Christmas suit? 

The Ugly Sweater Store - purveyors of all things Ugly Sweater - are selling three Christmas suits each with a different design for those of you wishing to go all out this festive season.

Named the 'Treemendous Suit,' the 'Christmaster' and the 'Rudolph,' the designs include Christmas trees, Snowmen and, you've guessed it, Rudolph the reindeer.

What a Christmas cracker: The Ugly Sweater Store is selling Ugly Christmas suits designed by OppoSuits

Happy Christmas: There are three different designs including Christmas trees, snowmen and snowflakes 

Already the suits, which retail at $110 (£70), have proved pretty popular. In fact, they are currently sound out on the store's site. 

This is the third year now that they have stocked Christmas suits which are designed by Amsterdam based clothing company OppoSuits. 

And the products have reportedly been snapped up by eager buyers all around the western world, from the US to the UK and Europe. 

In fact, when Prince Harry attended the 22nd Annual ICAP Charity Day last week, he was greeted by traders wearing the festive outfits.

During the day, the Prince took to the phones at the ICAP head quarters making trades across a number of sections from fuel to the Euro all in the name of charity. 

He was joined by stars including Helen Mirren and Benedict Cumberbatch and even Cheryl Fernandez-Versini.

As well as the the suits, the Ugly Sweater Store have a selection of Christmas jumpers with a variety of different designs. 

The company was started by Mike Golomb, who over the years has collected over 30,000 ugly sweaters - it is rare that any two jumpers on the site are the same.

They describe an ugly sweater as: 'An overly-gaudy garment that is often adorned with large applique or knitted cartoon-like figures. The more beading, bells, buttons and sequins - the better.'

Having a laugh: Prince Harry seemed to enjoy his day fundraising at the ICAP charity offices
