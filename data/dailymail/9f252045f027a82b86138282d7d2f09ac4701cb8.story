Sales of Big Bird costumes have skyrocketed in the run-up to Halloween ever since the Sesame Street character found itself thrust into the battle for the U.S. presidency.

The 7ft bird has become the centre of frenzied debate after Mitt Romney professed his love for the children's favourite during last week's first presidential debate in Denver.

Big Bird now looks set to play a leading role in this year's Halloween celebrations as a number of fancy dress stores have reported a surge of interest in the past few days.

Yellow fever: Sales of Big Bird costumes, in particular these 'sassy' versions, have shot up as much as 500 per cent in some stores after the Sesame Street character was mentioned in last week's U.S. presidential debate

Romney's debate trick is a treat for business: The outfits, which come in a variety of designs, but most with a short, yellow dress, orange knee-highs and a bird headband, are flying off the shelves in time for Halloween

A representative from costumecraze.com said it had experienced a 500 per cent increase in sales of the 'sassy Big Bird adult costume' alone.

Some versions of the outfit come with a short, yellow dress with orange knee-highs and a bird headband.

Meanwhile, other Sesame Street characters - the sassy Cookie Monster and the sassy Elmo costume - had not seen a boost in sales.

'The 500 per cent increase must be due to Big Birdâ€™s increased popularity post-debate,' the representative told ABC News.

Mixed messages: Romney told of his fondness for Sesame Street during the presidential debate on PBS, but in the same breath said he would cut funding to the public broadcaster, which airs the children's programme

Debt-buster: Romney told the debate that he was going to stop borrowing money from China to 'pay for things we don't need'

Costume World's CEO and founder Marilynn Wick said the avian puppet was also a hit in their stores.

'We have four store locations and all of them are selling out of the Big Bird costumes,' she added.

Halloween
Express, which does not have a licence to sell the trademarked Big Bird 
costumes, said it has had more than 400 searches for the
outfit on its website.

Brad Butler, the firm's COO, said it had also seen an increase in sales of its chicken costume, which
resembles the Big Bird suit and includes the feet and yellow pants.

Spitting feathers: Barack Obama's Democrats responded by releasing a video (above) featuring Big Bird which mocks Mr Romney for taking aim at PBS rather than cracking down on financial fraud

The interest all started last week when Romney told of his fondness for Sesame Street during the presidential debate on PBS, but in the same breath said he would cut funding to the public broadcaster, which airs the children's programme.

He said: 'I'm sorry Jim (the debate moderator), I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS.

'I like PBS - I love Big Bird, I actually like you, too, but I'm going to stop borrowing money from China to pay for things we don't need.'

Barack Obama responded by releasing a video featuring Big Bird which mocks Mr Romney for taking aim at PBS rather than cracking down on financial fraud.

Sesame Street has criticised the Obama campaign for exploiting their character and demanded that the campaign advert be cancelled and removed from the internet.
