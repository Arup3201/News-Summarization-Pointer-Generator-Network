A teenage boy who persuaded Prince Charles to take a 'selfie' with him earlier this week, has revealed that it was not the first time he posed with one of Britain's leading men.

Joseph Wilson, 17, also convinced David Cameron to take a self-portrait photograph, when the Prime Minister visited his flood-hit home village of Yalding in Kent, last year.

Following his success with Mr Cameron, the student was dared by his friends to approach the Prince of Wales, and, unlike when asked by actress Joan Collins, the royal agreed.

Young Mr Wilson's 'selfie' with Prince Charles was taken earlier this week during his and the Duchess of Cornwall's visit to Yaldin.

It has now emerged that Mr Wilson also managed to convince the Prime Minister to pose was confronted by furious flood victims in the village in December.

In stark contrast to the Prince of Wales, Mr Cameron’s stern facial expression suggests he’s keen to make a hasty exit.

Mr Wilson, who helped rescue people trapped in their homes by paddling around the village in his kayak on Christmas Day, today said: ‘I was with my mates and we were there to get a photo and thought why not try to get a selfie?

‘We managed to take one as he was about to get into the car. It was fun. I was quite surprised he agreed!’

Joseph Wilson, 17, who took the selfie with Prince Charles, said: 'He just congratulated us on our role in the floods and thanked us for being so helpful to everyone'

Joseph said: ‘I think everyone was quite glad he came down.

‘Some people were quite angry and not happy about being flooded but it was about focusing on what really needs to be done to get back to normal.’

Earlier this month actress Joan Collins told how she failed to convince the Prince to pose for a star-studded selfie with celebrities including Sir Ben Kingsley, Jeremy Irons and Tess Daly.

But on Tuesday Joseph, a sixth form student at the Judd School in Tonbridge, managed to work his magic inside the local church.

He said: ‘I just asked Prince Charles for a selfie and he let me. He took it very well and chuckled to himself.

‘I took the photo and he started laughing. He was cool with it.

‘I showed my friends because they dared me to take the photo, so it’s proof I don’t back out of a dare. My friends were quite impressed.'
