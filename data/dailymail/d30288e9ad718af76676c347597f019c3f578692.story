He was already in a bit of a hole over fracking but, as he tried to make amends, George Osborne's father-in-law only managed to dig himself in even deeper.

Having by his own admission caused a 'great furore' by declaring that shale gas exploration should take place in the 'desolate' North East, Lord Howell corrected himself.

He said he meant the North West - sparking a fresh round of derision.

Controversy: Lord Howell of Guildford said fracking could go ahead in the North East because it was inhabitable, but now insists he meant the North West

The Tory peer had told the House of Lords that 'beautiful rural areas' of the South should be spared from the controversial drilling. Instead there were 'large, uninhabited and desolate areas' of the North East where there was 'plenty of room for fracking'.

His comments in the House of Lords drew gasps of astonishment – and immediate condemnation.

Archbishop
 of Canterbury Justin Welby tweeted: ‘North east England very beautiful,
 rugged, welcoming, inspiring, historic, advancing, not “desolate” as 
was said in House of Lords today.’

But the former Energy Secretary now insists that what was on his mind when he made the incendiary remark was 'drilling going on off the Lancashire coast' - in the North West.

'It came out of my mouth as the North East, which you can blame me for rightly,' he told the Daily Telegraph.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg urged Lord Howell to keep quiet.

'I
 have a simple bit of advice for Lord Howell, which is when you are in a
 hole, stop fracking,' he said on his weekly LBC 97.3 phone-in.

Labour's shadow attorney general 
Emily Thornberry lambasted the peer for implying it just wanted fracking
 to happen 'somewhere a long way from Surrey'.

Journalist Mark Ferguson tweeted a picture of Lancashire, adding: 'OI! Lord Howell. This is Lancashire. It’s not #desolate! But it’s all “up there” to some people eh?'

Cuadrilla has drilled exploratory wells in Lancashire which is thought to be plentiful in natural gas - but the activity has been blamed for two small earthquakes in the area.

Lord Howell, father of the Chancellor's wife Frances, said he had made a 'stupid error' by mentioning any location, because fracking needed to be 'far away from residences in unloved places that are not environmentally sensitive' - unlike wind farms which he blamed for 'terrible desecration' of the landscape.

However he added: 'It's odd that they've decided to do this exploring in sensitive places down in Sussex.'

Downing Street distanced itself from Lord Howell on Tuesday when the row erupted.

Michael Fallon, the Tory energy minister, said there was 'exciting' potential for shale gas in the 'north, south, east and west'.

Ministers said that the South could become 'the second biggest area of shale in Britain'.

But Mr Clegg suggested that Tories include Mr Osborne and David Cameron were getting 'overexcited' about its potential benefits.

He warned it would be 'difficult' to persuade local communities to accept fracking near their homes.

Mr Clegg added: 'At the moment we are in a very early stage of all of this. My own hunch is that people are getting a little bit overexcited about how much gas is going to be yielded in a short period of time through fracking.'

Yesterday the daughter of singer Chrissie Hynde was arrested at anti-fracking protests.

Environmental activist Natalie Hynde, 30, had 'superglued' herself to the entrance of a rural drilling site earmarked for potential fracking in West Sussex.

The site in Balcombe has become a focal point for communities concerned about the process. But yesterday Energy Minister Michael Fallon said that 'towns, villages and countryside' could all be targeted for drilling if gas were discovered, no matter their location or beauty.

Determined: Natalie Hynde superglued herself to Simon 'Sitting Bull' Medhurst to create a 'human lock' by the gate to the proposed drilling entrance

Removed: Ms Hynde and her partner Mr Medhurst were arrested following the stunt at a protest against fracking planned for a site in Balcombe, West Sussex

So far, 25 protesters have been held by police in Balcombe. Arrested alongside Miss Hynde - the daughter of the Kinks' Ray Davies and the Pretenders star - was her boyfriend, eco-warrior Simon 'Sitting Bull' Medhurst, 55. They had glued their hands together in a 'human lock' by the gate to the proposed drilling entrance at around 8.30am.

A row of police officers acted as a human shield to hold back protesters while negotiating with the pair for more than two hours.

They were eventually freed using glue thinner and were still in custody last night. They had set up camp opposite the main entrance to the gate.

Fracking involves pumping liquid at high pressure deep underground to split shale rock and release gas for use as fuel. Mr Fallon warned the village would not be the only site in the South that could see drilling, if the country is to benefit from a gas bonanza.

He added the South could become 'the second biggest area of shale in Britain' and communities could benefit financially.

In June, a British Geological Survey claimed there may be more than 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas under the North of England alone.

Industry experts claim even if 10 per cent is recovered - more than all of the gas produced from the North Sea - it will be enough to power Britain for 50 years.
