Rail union firebrand Bob Crow has thanked his movement's nemesis Margaret Thatcher for helping him get his job.

The RMT boss revealed if it wasn't for the former Tory Prime Minister he would never have been elected because she changed the rules on trade union ballots.

Crow has attracted criticism after it was revealed he jetted off on a luxury holiday to Brazil before last week's London Underground strike.

In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, Crow said: 'I suppose I've got Margaret Thatcher to thank for my career. The truth is I'd never have been elected if it wasn't for her.

'Our rulebook used to say you couldn't stand as general secretary unless you were a member of the Labour Party. I wasn't But Maggie did away with that rule because she thought people from the business community would take up union jobs.'

Speaking about his £10,000 holiday, Crow said it was booked a year ago for his girlfriend Nicola Hoarau's 50th birthday.

The union chief was seen sipping contentedly from a coconut and baking on a golden beach in his Bermuda shorts as officials in rain-lashed Britain tried to halt the 48-hour strike in London.

Speaking in The Sun today, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said Bob Crow is hypocrite who is depriving a poor family of a council house.

He said: 'Taxpayer-funded homes are there to help Brits on lower wages. We have a duty to help our neighbours if they genuinely need support.

'Britain is a caring society, with a safety net to be proud of. But Bob Crow is taking the mick. He thinks this safety net should be a hammock.'

Crow, who takes home a £145,000-a-year pay package, has
 also faced criticism for living in a housing association home in 
Woodford Green, east London, intended for less well off people at a 
subsidised rate.

Crow recently said he had 'no moral duty' to move out of his home: 'I was born in a council house; as far as I'm concerned, I will die in one.'

However, 
today it was revealed he is facing the prospect of having his rent 
doubled to the market rate under new government rules on wealthy 
tenants.

The Sunday Times revealed from next year Crow and his family could see their rent increase by about £175 a week following new rules affecting an estimated 21,000 households in social or council accommodation who earn £60,000 or more.

The house, understood to be in Hoarau's name, is owned by London & Quadrant housing association, which charges other families on the street £150 a week. Crow and Hoarau are believed to pay £175 because their home is an end of terrace property.

Housing minister Kris Hopkins said: 'We intend to give landlords the option to charge very high-earning social tenants want to continue using this precious national resource, they will pay for the privilege.'
