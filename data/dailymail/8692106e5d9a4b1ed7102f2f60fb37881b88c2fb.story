A city is to remove nearly all of its bus lanes after a study found they were not working properly.

Only four of the 26 lanes in Liverpool will be saved, if the city council approves, and they could operate at different times.

Mayor Joe Anderson said: ‘I want to make sure that travelling through the city is as quick as possible for all road users.

‘It’s vital for business, for residents, for visitors and I wasn’t convinced our routes were working as well as they could.

‘For the first time we have robust data about the effects of bus lanes, rather than people’s opinions about how useful or otherwise they are.

‘There are clear recommendations that the majority of bus lanes should be removed.’

Opposition to the bus lanes from motorists has been strong for many years, with repeated accusations that they were being treated as a ‘cash cow’ for the local authority.

An investigation in 2012 found that more than £3.7million in fines had been raked in by the city council after unsuspecting motorists strayed into the lanes.

Liverpool now aims to get traffic moving by cracking down on illegally parked cars.

Mr Anderson said: ‘A number of issues that have emerged during the discussions include the level of indiscriminate parking on some of our key bus lane routes which disrupt traffic flow.’

He also said he was looking at where more cycle lanes could be introduced.
