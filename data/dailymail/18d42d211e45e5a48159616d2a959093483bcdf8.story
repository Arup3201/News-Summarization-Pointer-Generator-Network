White House staff are tip-toeing around revelations that the French president has a mistress as they face the awkward question of just who will be his plus one at a state dinner next month. 

Francois Hollande, 59, faced the world's media for the first time on Tuesday after it was reported that he had been sneaking to a Paris apartment to meet up with 41-year-old actress Julie Gayet - unbeknown to his partner and France's de facto first lady Valerie Trierweiler.

When asked if Trierweiler was still the first lady of France, the President dodged the question earlier this week, saying: 'This is neither the time nor the place.'

President Obama speaks alongside French President Francois Hollande  at the G8 Summit at Camp David in 2012. Questions have been raised over who the French president might be bringing to dinner in DC next month after news of an affair broke

Mr
 Hollande, who allegedly has been sneaking off on a scooter for trysts with Ms 
Gayet in a flat 150 yards from the Elysee, said that he would make his mind up about who his first lady was 
by February 11.

This is the date that he is due to be in Washington for a meeting with President Obama and First Lady Michelle.  The White House invitation was addressed to 'President Hollande and Valérie Trierweiler'.

The Obama administration sidestepped all questions on the dinner, directing queries to the French government.

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the Embassy of France in Washington today.

However earlier statements from French officials suggested that they were also bewildered as to who Mr Hollande would bring as his White House dinner date.

Despite the diplomatic headache that is causes with regards protocol, White House spokesman Jay 
Carney has said: 'The president looks forward to seeing President 
Hollande for the state visit in February.

'On issues of the delegation 
that the French come with, I would refer you to the French government.'

In
 words which may be considered extremely cruel by both women, Mr 
Hollande even confirmed that the presidential partner had 'no official 
status' in France, and he was determined to keep costs down by whoever 
was confirmed as first lady.

Democrat Representative Gerald Connolly, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs panel told thehill.com: 'Quel dommage...What a problem to have.'

Ms
 Trierweiler, meanwhile, remains in a central Paris hospital after she 
had a 'nervous breakdown' finding out about Mr Hollande's cheating.

President
 Hollande is not thought to have even visited Ms Trierweiler at the 
Petite Salpetriere hospital since she checked in last Friday.

Ms
 Trierweiler, a journalist for Paris Match magazine, has styled herself 
as France's first lady.

This entitled her to five permanent 
staff, and numerous other perks, including limousines, private jets and 
homes all over France.

Plus one? French President Francois Hollande with partner Valerie Trierweiler in May 2013. Allegations have arisen that he has a long-standing affair with actress Julie Gayet

Affair: Hollande is alleged to be having an affair with French actress Julie Gayet

Despite
 Mr Hollande's insistence that the scandal is a 'private matter' which 
should be kept 'secret', Julie Gayet is the cover girl in the latest 
edition of French Elle.

In it she is quoted as telling a friend 'more
 than a year ago' that she has found an 'older man, very different from 
earlier boyfriends, who is in politics.'

This raises the prospect
 that Mr Hollande started the affair within a few months of being sworn 
in as French president in May 2012.

The storm surrounding the president shows no sign of ceasing as former president Nicolas Sarkozy branded him 'ridiculous'.

Mr Sarkozy told Le Canard Enchaîné he had dealt with his relationship with Carla Bruni much better.

'He's got himself into a right old pickle,' He said. 'While everyone has the right to a private life, when one is a public figure and president, one must be careful to avoid being ridiculous.'

Manuel Valls, the Interior Minister, was also quoted in the Times as saying Hollande acted like a 'retarded adolescent' when presented with pictures of the president on the scooter.

And the Telegraph reports today that 
Miss Gayet is pursuing legal action for 'violation of privacy' against 
Closer magazine that published photos it said proves she is Mr 
Hollande's mistress.

Mr Hollande expressed 'total outrage' after the publication of the photos but has not denied the affair.
