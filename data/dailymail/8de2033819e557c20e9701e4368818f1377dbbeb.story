Pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine ignored a public call by Russian President Vladimir Putin to postpone a referendum on independence, declaring they would go ahead on May 11 with a vote that could lead to war.

Denis Pushilin, a leader of the self-declared separatist Donetsk People's Republic, said on Thursday that the ‘People's Council’ had voted unanimously to hold the plebiscite as planned.

‘Civil war has already begun. The referendum can put a stop to it and start a political process,’ he told reporters.

Change of heart: Putin, pictured during a wreath laying ceremony at the Kremlin, said that a referendum in eastern Ukraine should be postponed

The announcement coincided with a sharp change of tone from Moscow, which had signalled a pullback from confrontation on Wednesday with Putin's call for the vote to be delayed and a declaration that troops were withdrawing from Ukraine's border.

Russian markets sank on the news, and in Kiev, officials promised to press on with their ‘anti-terrorist campaign’ to retake control over the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk regardless of the rebels' decision on the vote.

Putin’s remarks have been a ploy to avert further sanctions from the West.

It’s possible that he may have publically called for the referendum to be postponed, while privately encouraging it.

Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet Western leaders for the first time since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis when he attends a World War Two anniversary in France next month, the Russian ambassador to Paris said on Thursday.

U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are among those due to attend the June 6 ceremony in Normandy to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings that helped turn the tide of the war against Nazi Germany.

Ambassador Alexander Orlov confirmed Putin's planned attendance in comments to BFM television, after France's president and defence minister both said the Russian leader - accused by the West of destabilising neighbouring Ukraine - was still welcome to come.

'I have told Vladimir Putin, as representative of the Russian people, that he is welcome to attend the ceremony,' President Francois Hollande said.

Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian went further, saying that cancelling Putin's invitation would be a historical insult.

'It is in the order of things that (Putin) should be there,' he told BFM.

Moscow's relations with the West have worsened dramatically since Ukrainians toppled their pro-Russian president in February and Russia responded by annexing Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and massing troops on the country's eastern border.

The United States and European Union have imposed sanctions on dozens of Russians, and leaders of the Group of Seven leading nations pulled out of a summit with Putin next month in Sochi, where Russia hosted the Winter Olympics in February.

Political analysts said Putin may have expected the rebels to go ahead with the referendum, showing that they were not under his orders. By distancing himself from a process that will not be recognised by the West Putin may also be hoping to avoid further sanctions as their effect begins to be felt in Russia.

Maria 
Lipman, an expert at the Carnegie Center think-tank in Moscow, said 
Putin would have known that his request for the referendum to be 
postponed would be rebuffed.

‘But
 this can be used to show that the people in Ukraine's east are not 
Russians, take no orders from Russia, that Russia exercises no control 
over them because they only do what they want to do,’ she said.

‘He
 has also distanced Russia from the referendum, which has a completely 
unclear status and will not be recognised by the West.’

Russia's defence ministry said Nato were misleading the world about the armed confrontation between Moscow and Kiev. It said the pro-Western Ukrainian government had assembled 15,000 troops on its border with Russia.

Nato said that it has not seen any evidence of Russian troops being pulled back from the border.

'I have very good vision but while we've noted Russia's statement so far we haven't seen any - any - indication of troops pulling back,' Nato Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in a post on Twitter.

Nato has accused Moscow of using special forces in the separatist takeover of mainly Russian speaking eastern Ukraine after annexing Crimea from Ukraine in March. Russia admitted its troops had been active in Crimea after initially denying any role there but says it is not involved in eastern Ukraine.

The ministry said it had asked the West to stop ‘cynically misinforming’ the international community.

The rebel decision to go ahead with the referendum appeared to have wrong-footed the West.

The European Union said shortly before the announcement that it was waiting to see whether Putin's words would be followed by deeds and that the plebiscite ‘would have no democratic legitimacy and could only further worsen the situation’.

At the same time, the Russian ambassador to Paris said Putin, who had been shunned by Western leaders since the Crimean takeover, would join them in a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the Normandy landings in World War Two.

Britain's attempts to isolate Russia risk being undermined by former cabinet member Lord Mandelson, who is listed as a confirmed attendee of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, organised by Putin.

One analyst said that going to the event, which the Foreign Office doesn't expect any UK ministers to attend, could make Lord Mandelson look like a 'Kremlin lackey'.

Dr Andrew Foxall, director of the Russia Studies Centre at the Henry Jackson Society think tank, told the Telegraph: 'If the West is to demonstrate that Russia is isolated because of its actions in Ukraine then boycotting the forum is an important step.'

The referendum has become seen as a vital step by many in Ukraine's industrial east, fired up over what the rebels, and Moscow, call the ‘fascist’ government in Kiev.

Putin's call for its postponement was intended to open the way to negotiations on cooling down a crisis that has led to dozens of deaths in clashes between troops and separatists in eastern Ukraine and rival groups in the southern port of Odessa.

Putin said on Thursday it was Kiev's ‘irresponsible politics’ that had caused the crisis.

Artyom, a rebel at a roadblock in the rebel-held eastern town of Slaviansk, said of the referendum decision: ‘This is great news. We need to have our say.’

In a further shift towards a confrontational stance, Putin oversaw test launches of military rockets during training exercises held across Russia on Thursday, the day before celebrations of the anniversary of its World War Two victory.

The West has accused Russia of using previous military exercises to build up forces along the border with Ukraine after the ousting of former Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovich in February.
