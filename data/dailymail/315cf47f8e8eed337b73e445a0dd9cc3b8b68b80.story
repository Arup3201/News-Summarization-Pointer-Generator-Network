A 15-year-old girl who went missing for seven days after being kidnapped from a French village has been found alive - tied up in a car boot hundreds of miles away in Germany, police said.

Chloe Rodriguez, of Barjac, Gard, was reported missing on November 9 after her scooter was found near her home, with all her belongings under the seat - apart from her helmet and mobile phone.

It prompted a national hunt but she was found alive last Friday after German police stopped a car close to the border near Offenburg. The girl’s mother Violette Rodriguez said it was a ‘beautiful' day.

She added: ‘There will be two 
birthdays for my little Chloe. This man who did her so much harm - there
is justice, and justice will be rendered. But I thank him anyway, 
because he kept her alive.’

The
car’s driver - who was from the same area as Chloe and wanted for robbery
in Germany - was arrested after a routine traffic stop. The unharmed girl was taken to hospital, reported NBC 
News.

Chloe
had memorised details about her kidnapper, his car and its 
number-plate, but never defied his orders over her seven-day ordeal 
because she was scared he would kill her, reported Metro France.

Her
parents said their daughter was feeling well despite being physically 
exhausted and regularly crying, reported RTL. Meanwhile Chloe’s alleged 
kidnapper was being held in a German prison.

The 32-year-old man was released from prison in September after being convicted of physical and sexual assault in 2009 against six women, who had been traveling alone in their rural communities.

He had been given the recommended psychiatric treatment in jail, the man’s lawyer said, reported RTL. But the man allegedly failed to check in with his probation officer after he was released.

Chloe returned home by TGV on Saturday and was covered by a blanket by her mother in the car as they travelled back to her house with a police escort from the train station.

‘She told us that she was able to have a dialogue with this man - and that she obeyed all his orders,’ Chloe’s father Jesus Rodriguez said outside the family’s home, reported L’Express.
