She's famous for her love of all things equine and now a set of rare vintage photos lay bare the Queen's affection for racing.

The images, released ahead of Royal Ascot 2014, include a rare snap of the then Princess Elizabeth arriving at the race in 1946 with her aunt, Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood.

Others show the Queen enjoying the races 
in 1952, shortly after ascending to the throne, and looking thrilled as 
her first ever Royal Ascot winner, Choir Boy, gallops across the finish 
line to take the Hunt Cup in 1953.

By 1958, the Queen had amassed another seven winners, although that didn't prevent her from celebrating delightedly as her eighth, Restoration, took the honours.

A keen racing fan, the Queen's career as a racehorse breeder and owner spans more than 60 years, and began with the handful that she was left by her father George VI.

Since then, her horses have since triumphed in more than 1600 races, including all five British Classics, with the exception of the Epsom Derby, although she has managed a second place finish with Aureole in 1953 and came third in 2011 with Carlton House.

While the Derby has so far eluded her, 
the Queen has bred some of the finest horses ever to race in the UK, 
among them Dunfermline who managed to win both the Epsom Oaks and St. 
Leger Stakes in 1977, Carozza, who triumphed in the Epsom Oaks in 1957 
and Pall Mall who took the 2,000 Guineas in 1958.

Last year, Royal Ascot was the scene of yet another triumph for the Queen, after her filly Estimate romped home to take the prestigious Gold Cup at Royal Ascot - much to the obvious delight of the monarch.

And it seems that this year's event, which opens on Tuesday, could prove just as lucky. 'Oh, I think she absolutely has a chance this year - without any question,' reveals Royal Ascot's head of international racing, Nick Smith.

'She
 has a fighting chance of winning the Gold Cup for the second year 
running with Estimate but she will also have a couple of other runners.'

Her appearance at next week's Royal Ascot
 will be the latest in a series of engagements, which began last week 
with the State Opening of Parliament and a state visit to France for the
 D-Day celebrations.

After processing down the Champs-Élysées on Thursday evening, the Queen spent the Friday meeting world leaders and paying her respects to the fallen in Bayeux and on Sword Beach.

The following day, she toured the Marche aux Fleurs - now renamed Reine Elizabeth II - before rushing back to the UK just in time to see chestnut three-year-old Australia romp home to victory in the £1.3m Derby.

This week has also proved busy with the Duke of Edinburgh's birthday on Tuesday followed by a visit to Westminster School to open their new sports hall yesterday.

No change: The Queen and the rest of the royal family are regular fixtures at Royal Ascot - and other meetings

Spotting a horse with potential isn't always easy - especially when you don't know one end of the animal from the other.

Happily, Royal Ascot's head of international racing, Nick Smith, is on hand to offer his tips on sorting the winners from the also-rans.

WHAT DOES A WINNER LOOK LIKE?

'Make
 sure you get a good look at the horses’ condition in the parade ring. When you’re studying them look for the ones with gleaming summer coats.

'It’s also important that the horse isn’t sweating 
so look out for the ones that are calm and relaxed and with what we call
 a quiet temperament.

'For many of them this will be the first time 
they’ve seen crowds this size so how they behave is important.'

WHAT DOES 'THE FORM' MEAN?

'Form
 is the term used to describe the past record of any given racehorse. 
This is usually detailed in the race card next to each horse’s name.

'A 
good tip is to see if the horse has won previously over the same 
distance and/or ground of the race they are about to run.'

HOW DOES GOING AFFECT THE OUTCOME?

'Going
 (or the ground) is absolutely fundamental to the outcome of any 
given race: Some horses will run on any ground but most horses will 
have a preference of either firm or soft conditions.

'When you see the 
term ‘good ground’ it means somewhere in between firm and soft.'

Winning ways: Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and his wife Princess Haya

WHICH HORSE IS YOUR TIP FOR THE GOLD CUP?

'I
 think it will be won by Leading Light whose trainer Aidan O’Brien has a
 remarkable record in the race, having won with Yeats four times in the 
past.

'Brown Panther, owned by Michael Owen has improved a lot - he’s in 
the form of his life at the moment and is a significantly better horse 
than last year.

'The Queen’s horse, Estimate, won the race last year, but
 this year it’s a much more competitive race.'

ARE THERE ANY OUTSIDERS WORTH LOOKING AT?

'There
 is a French horse called American Devil which was trained by Eric Libaud and is running in the Diamond Jubilee 
Stakes on Saturday.

'He got nominated for Royal Ascot 
straight after his recent win at Longchamp the other day, so that in 
itself is a real tip.'

WHO ARE THE OWNERS TO LOOK FOR?

'Flat
 racing is dominated by superpowers. I have tremendous respect for the 
Coolmore Syndicate from Ireland and the amount of incredible horses they
 have.

'Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum [ruler of Dubai and vice president and prime minister of the UAE] is massively respected - he has been investing in 
British racing for 40 years.

'Britain is now seeing patronage 
from Saudi Arabia too. Prince Khalid ibn Abdullah is much 
respected – his colours, carried by the mighty Frankel, are the best.'
