More than 80 per cent of patients on some hospital wards would not want their loved ones treated there, according to the Government’s own figures.

They show there are 19 wards across England where at least half of patients there last month would not recommend the care to their friends and family.

The worst is Blackpool Victoria Hospital’s ward 12, which specialises in illnesses of the stomach and intestine and which none of the patients said they would recommend.

In Swindon Great Western Hospital’s Woodpecker ward, only six of 41 patients who took part in the survey last month would be happy for loved ones to receive treatment there.

The Government launched its flagship ‘friends and family’ test in April to measure levels of care and give patients and relatives more information about standards in hospitals.

It can be filled in by any patient going to casualty or staying overnight on a ward and consists of a simple question: ‘How likely are you to recommend our ward/A&E department to friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment?’ 

Patients tick one of six boxes – extremely likely, likely, neither, unlikely, extremely unlikely or don’t know. Each hospital, A&E unit and ward is then given a score of between -100 and 100, which is the number of ‘positive’ patients minus the ‘negative’ patients.

Any score above 0 is regarded as good, while above 50 is seen as excellent. The latest results show the average A&E score is 50, while the average for hospital wards is 72.

The test has been described as the NHS’s equivalent of ‘Tripadvisor’ – the website where the public can recommend restaurants and hotels.

The public can see the scores on the NHS Choices website along with comments from other patients.

The Government has told hospitals to ensure that at least 15 per cent of patients complete the surveys. 

But the latest monthly  figures show that in one A&E unit, at Medway Maritime Hospital, in Gillingham, Kent, just four out of the 3,547 patients who appeared last month did so.

Only six of the 3,367 patients who arrived at Milton Keynes A&E last month completed the poll – fewer than 0.2 per cent.

These figures will fuel concerns that staff are handing forms only to patients they know are pleased with their care. 

But NHS England said response rates have steadily improved since the surveys were launched six months ago.

Patients are also asked whether there is anything they would change on the ward.

Hillingdon NHS Trust in West London has rolled out quietly-closing bins and dimmer lights after patients complained that it was too noisy and too bright at night.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the surveys represented ‘real patient power’ and were ‘driving hospitals to raise their game’. 

Hospitals with consistently low scores are referred to the Care Quality Commission.
