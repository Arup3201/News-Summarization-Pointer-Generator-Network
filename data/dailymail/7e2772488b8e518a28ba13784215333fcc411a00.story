Dave Fields, 75, was knocked down and killed when he was hit by a reversing car wash worker as he waited to have his car cleaned

A great grandfather was knocked down and killed by a car wash worker - after taking his vehicle in for a clean, a court heard.

Retired butcher Dave Fields, 75, had taken his car in for its regular wash at Cwmbran Car Wash when he was hit by one of the employees.

The pensioner was watching his car being washed when learner driver Sokol Muja, 27, reversed a people carrier into him.

A court heard how Mr Fields was knocked to ground on the car wash forecourt where he hit his head and died.

Prosecutor James Wilson said: 'Mr Fields became aware of a Chrysler Voyager reversing in his direction and CCTV footage showed saw him back-pedalling in an attempt to avoid the vehicle. 

'He was seen holding out his walking stick to shield himself but the rear of the vehicle hit him and he fell on the back of his head.'

Great-grandfather Mr Fields, described as the anchor of his large family, remained conscious but his condition worsened in hospital and he died five days later.

Mr Fields' daughter-in-law Kathy told the court in an impact statement: 'He was a very special man who was much loved by his family and the community.

'The family will never get over the tragic way he died. Without him we are all lost. Our whole World has been turned upside down and we have lost the anchor to our family.

'He was a real family man who touched many hearts and will be dearly missed.'

Muja, who had been learning to drive at the time of the accident, was quizzed by police after the collision.

He claimed he had not seen Mr Fields when he knocked him down at the car wash owned by his brother on the Llantarnam Industrial Estate at Cwmbran, South Wales.

Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) heard that the car wash firm had no insurance policy for employees to drive customer vehicles and Judge Eleri Rees urged the Health and Safety Executive to investigate

Cardiff Crown Court heard that the car wash firm had no insurance policy for employees to drive customer vehicles and Judge Eleri Rees urged the Health and Safety Executive to investigate.

She handed Muja, who also admitted driving without insurance and in accordance with the provisional licence he holds, a six month suspended sentence. He was banned from driving for two years.

Judge Rees also ordered Muja to undertake 250 hours of community work and told to pay £350 in costs and victim surcharge.

She told Muja, from Cwmbran: 'Your action resulted in a tragic and needless loss of life and you will have to bear the burden of guilt throughout your life.'
