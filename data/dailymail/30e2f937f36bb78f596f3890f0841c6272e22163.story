1. Winning performance

2. Player's performance per match

3. Appearances

4. Goals scored

5. Assists

6. Clean sheets

Despite a worse pass completion rate - managing to find a team-mate only 82.2 per cent of the time - Oscar's defensive work sees him finish one place above Willian in the Player Performance Index chart.
