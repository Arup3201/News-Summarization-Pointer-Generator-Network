One of Britainâ€™s most wanted men, who taunted police by posing on Facebook in a silver wig and Dame Edna Everage-style sunglasses, has been jailed for 15 months following a nationwide manhunt.

Michael Easy, 28, was finally captured and brought to justice after he viciously attacked a teenager at a party in Southampton.

While on the run, the fugitive managed to mock officers by updating his Facebook page with photographs of him pressing his finger to his lips while wearing a platinum wig and pink Dame Edna Everage-style glasses.

Jailed: Michael Easy has been jailed following his latest attack on a woman. While on the run, he mocked police by updating his Facebook page with photographs of him wearing a wig and Dame Edna-style glasses

He also changed his profile name to Michelle.

But today the serial offender â€“ who has more than 27 convictions to his name - is behind bars and will be spending Christmas in jail after being sentenced to 15 months for kicking and slapping a woman at a party.

Violence flared on May 24 when Easy and another man gate-crashed a party which was also attended by Toni Lee Dumper, 19.

Fugitive: While on the run made Michael Easy set up a Facebook page under the name 'Michelle Dirt'

Easy demanded to be told the whereabouts of her sister - an ex-girlfriend.

Violent: Michael Easy is said to have two previous weapon-related convictions and six for attacks on previous girlfriends

The prosecution claimed Easy then produced a knife and caused a small cut to her neck, struck her across the face and then kicked her.

Easy, of no fixed address, was convicted of causing actual bodily harm but was acquitted of possessing a knife.

Said to have two previous 
weapon-related convictions and six for attacks on previous girlfriends, 
Easy admitted he had slapped the woman but denied having a knife.

Speaking about his problems with anger, Easy said: 'I have tried in every situation to keep out of trouble.

'I am 28 and I have a 14-year-old kid. I never had a knife and I donâ€™t know how she got cut.'

Passing sentence at Southampton Crown Court, Judge Gary Burrell QC told Easy: 'The injuries themselves were trivial.'

'Nevertheless
 you have a bad history for violence, and if you continue in this way 
you will end up with longer and longer sentences in prison, and you will
 be considered a danger to the public.'

The judge also banned him for contacting Miss Dumper for five years.
