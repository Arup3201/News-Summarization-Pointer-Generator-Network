A chilling photo that allegedly proves Russia's most wanted terrorist is dead was released today by the head of the Chechen Republic.

Pro-Vladimir Putin leader Ramzan Kadyrov uploaded the image of what is claimed to be Doku Umarov's body to the social-networking site Instagram.

Alongside the photo, he wrote: 'For those who would like to believe that this rat is still alive, we can show him after his death.'

Proof? This photo that allegedly proves Russia's most wanted terrorist, Doku Umarov, is dead was released today by head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov. It was posted on social-networking site Instagram

Wanted man: Known as Russia's Osama bin Laden, Umarov (pictured) is Vladamir Putin's most wanted enemy

Known as Russia's Osama bin Laden, Umarov is Putin's most wanted enemy - sought for crimes of terrorism, kidnapping, homicide and treason.

The bearded warlord is responsible for a string of deadly attacks on Russia, including a train bombing between Moscow and Saint Petersburg which left 26 dead in 2009 and an attack on a Siberian dam which killed 75.

He has also been linked to the 2010 Moscow Metro bombings, in which 40
 died, and the hit on one of the city's main airports, Domodedovo, in 
2011, in which 36 people perished.

In April, Russian sources indicated Umarov had died without giving clear evidence.

It is not clear why Mr Kadyrov decided to release the photo of his 'dead body' today - particularly as Russia is under the spotlight for allegedly supporting terrorists in Ukraine in downing the Malaysian Boeing 777. 

The Chechen strongman did not provide any details as to how, where or when Umarov died.

But he said: 'I have said earlier that Doku Umarov had been killed in a special mission. But various law enforcement authorities and the media hurried to doubt the information.

'They claimed they did not see the dead body. We at that time had undisputable proofs he had been killed. Later on, the fact of his death was confirmed officially.

Atrocity: Umarov's Caucasus Emirate group claimed responsibility for the bomb that caused the November 2009 Nevsky Express train derailment that left 27 dead

Bombings: The group is also thought to have been behind three suicide bombings in the southern Russian city of Volgograd which killed 41 people in 2013, including this attack on a trolleybus

'Now, to those who would prefer to believe that rat is still alive, we can demonstrate it after death.'

On April 8, FSB spy chief Aleksandr Bortnikov told a meeting of the National Anti-Terrorist Committee in Moscow that Umarov's activities had been 'stopped'.

Umarov had been seen as a threat to the Sochi Winter Olympics - but he is likely to have been killed earlier than this. 

Styling himself the 'Emir of the Caucasus Emirate', his aim was to expel non-Muslims from Chechnya, impose Sharia law and wage jihad far beyond the republic's present borders.

Attack: Umarov was blamed for suicide bombings in Volgograd (above) which killed 34 people at Christmas

A trademark of his attacks was his deployment of 'black widow' women suicide bombers, ready to cause mass murder in vengeance for the death of their insurgent spouses.

The U.S. had placed a $5million (£2.9million) bounty on his head.

Umarov, who is thought to have died aged 49, has been reported slain on at least six occasions.

In December last year, Kadyrov alleged he has been 'dead a long time'.
