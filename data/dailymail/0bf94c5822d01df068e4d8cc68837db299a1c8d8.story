David Cameron last night made an appeal to Syria's military and security leaders in an extraordinary attempt to spark a coup against Bashar al-Assad.

The Prime Minister said the future of the country's army and security forces would be guaranteed were Assad's regime to fall.

He persuaded his G8 counterparts – including Russia, which has long supported the Assad regime – to sign up to a declaration that Syria needs a 'transitional government' that can command the 'mutual consent' of its people.

Outlining a future for the country, a statement said 'public services must be preserved or restored'.

'This includes the military forces and security services,' it added. Diplomats confirmed this was a direct message to the leaders of Assad's military and security forces that they would not be swept aside if he is removed.

Western leaders hope elements of the Syrian regime who are losing patience with their president may be persuaded to move against him if they believe their future is secured.

Russian president Vladimir Putin, however, refused to agree to an explicit demand that Assad should go, and claimed that arming the Syrian opposition could deliver weapons into the hands of the sort of people who slaughtered Drummer Lee Rigby on the streets of London.

Mr Putin also defended Russia's supply of arms to the Assad regime, saying it was fulfilling 'legal contracts' made with the 'legal government of Syria'.

In a reference to the 'brutal killing' of Drummer Rigby in Woolwich last month, the Russian president added: 'Clearly the [Syrian] opposition is not composed all of this but many of them are exactly the same as the ones who perpetrated the killing in London.

'If we equip these people, if we arm them what is going to control and verify who is going to have these weapons, including in Europe as well.

'So we call all our partners, before making this dangerous step, think about it very carefully.'

Mr Putin firmly rejected suggestions that the Syrian talks had pitched him against the other G8 nations over his continued support for the regime.

Meanwhile, Mr Cameron, who chaired the G8 summit on Lough Erne, Northern Ireland, backed further away from the prospect of Britain supplying arms to rebel groups.

The Prime Minister has been warned by senior colleagues that he would be unlikely to win a vote on such a move in the Commons.

'Nobody wants to see more conflict, nobody wants to see more arms, nobody wants to see more death,' Mr Cameron said.

Instead, he made an appeal to those around Assad who know 'in their hearts' that he can never again lead a stable country, following two years of conflict and at least 93,000 deaths.

'Clearly in Syria there are all sorts of people who desperately want Assad to go. There are those in the official opposition who have put their lives on the line to achieve that,' Mr Cameron said.

'But I suspect there are also many, many others who may have supported him in the past but who know after all that has been done, after all the horrors committed, after the use of chemical weapons, that it is literally unthinkable that someone like this would be able to run a unified and stable Syria into the future.'

It is hoped a transitional governing body will be agreed at a peace conference in Geneva, which the G8 wants to see happen in August or September.

Yesterday's summit also agreed to call for all parties to the conflict to allow access to a UN team investigating the use of chemical weapons.

The U.S., the UK and their allies are convinced Assad has ordered chemical weapons attacks on his own people and say tests have now confirmed them beyond doubt. But Russia still disputes the evidence.

The summit also agreed to almost $1.5billion in aid to assist the millions displaced by the conflict.

Mr Cameron agreed the largest single funding commitment ever made by the UK in response to a humanitarian disaster, as he announced a £175million emergency package for the Syrian crisis, taking UK funding for Syria to date to £348million.
