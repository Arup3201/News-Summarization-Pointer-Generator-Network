A 25-year-old jogger was  struck and killed by a snowplow in the early hours of Sunday after stepping out into the road to avoid a puddle or debris while wearing headphones, police have said.

Michael Walsh, believed to be an experienced runner, was jogging along South Main Street in Torrington, Connecticut, shortly after 5am when he unwittingly moved into the path of the vehicle.

Seconds later, the city truck, which was not plowing the road at the time, crashed into Mr Walsh, leaving him with serious injuries. The driver got out of the plow and promptly dialed 911.

Mr Walsh was rushed to Charlotte Hungerford Hospital. But despite medics' best efforts, he was shortly declared dead, according to Fox 12. His family have since been informed of his death.

The driver - who remained at the scene until police arrived - was also taken to hospital as a precaution. He has cooperated with officers and no charges have yet been filed, it is reported.

Following the incident, Sargeant Greg Wityak told the Republican-American of Waterbury that the truck was doing a 'regular route' when it collided with Mr Walsh who was running southbound.

This means its 'plow' was not down at the time, he said, adding that the victim may not have heard the vehicle because he was wearing a pair of headphones.

On Sunday morning, it was dark, foggy and raining, while the road was covered in slush. However, police have said it is too early to tell if the conditions played a role in Mr Walsh's death.

Frazier Pearson, who lives nearby, said: 'You usually see people running up and down the road all of the time,' adding that the area is 'pretty well-lit area by street lights and lights from the [local] park'.

In a statement, Torrington Mayor Elinor Carbone said: 'There are no words to express the sadness that we feel over this tragic accident. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the victim.

'This terrible accident affects everyone involved and our deepest sympathies go out to all. We will be working closely with the state Department of Transportation to investigate this painful situation'

South Main Street from Litchfield Street to Cook Street was closed on Sunday morning while an accident investigation team examined the scene, according to Fox CT.

The state police also assisted because the plow  is a commercial vehicle.

An investigation is ongoing.
