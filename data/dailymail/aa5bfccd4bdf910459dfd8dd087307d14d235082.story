Trouble: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson blamed the badgers for the cull falling short

As the badger cull descended into chaos yesterday, the minister in charge was put on the spot.

Why had marksmen shot fewer than half the original target number, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson was asked.

And he was in no doubt as to who was to blame: The badgers.

They had ‘moved the goalposts’, said Mr Paterson, explaining that their populations had shifted in unpredictable ways.

He made the comment after it emerged only 850 animals were killed during the six-week pilot in Somerset, far fewer than the initial aim of 2,100.

No data is yet available for the other pilot in Gloucestershire which ends next week.

Campaigners branded the scheme a ‘farce’ and said the inability to meet the target could actually increase the spread of disease in cattle.

Experts had warned at least 70 per cent of the animals in an area must be killed to limit bovine tuberculosis.

But Mr Paterson insisted the trial had been a success by reducing local badger numbers by almost 60 per cent, and said the original target figure was simply set too high.

He announced the cull target for Somerset now stood at just over 1,000 following new population estimates.

For both pilot schemes, the other being in Gloucestershire, the bar has now been lowered from 5,000 badgers to just over 2,500 animals.

Asked if he had moved the goalposts, Mr Paterson said: ‘I am not moving anything. The badgers are moving the goalposts.’

He added: ‘The badgers are a wild 
animal. They move their populations up and down according to weather, 
according to breeding patterns and according to disease.’

He also confirmed the cull companies would be seeking up to a three-week extension to try to reduce numbers further.

The
 original 5,000 target was based on 2012 estimates of badger 
populations, said Mr Paterson. But newer research showed numbers had now
 fallen by around a third, because of flooding, food scarcity and 
disease.

Badger expert Professor Rosie Woodroffe said the failure to kill enough animals meant the trials should now be stopped.

She
 said: ‘When you kill badgers two things happen. The first is there are 
fewer badgers, and for disease control that should be a good thing.

‘But
 also you change the behaviour of badgers in ways which increase the 
transmission of disease in badgers, so each badger is more infectious to
 cattle... They are more likely to travel, and they are mixing more with
 badgers from other social groups.’

Meanwhile, Gavin Grant, RSPCA chief executive, said: ‘Frankly this whole situation is a farce.

‘Whatever the figures, it is clear that the system has failed.’

Despite
 widespread opposition, the Government has been committed to the 
controversial scheme, which it hopes will help limit the spread of 
tuberculosis in cattle.

National Farmers Union president Peter Kendall welcomed yesterday’s announcement.

‘The
 knowledge learned from these two badger cull pilot areas will be 
invaluable in helping to deliver future roll-out of badger control 
operations in areas where the incidence of TB is rife,’ he said.

‘Our
 absolute focus, and that of everyone involved, is disease control. More
 than 38,000 cattle were slaughtered in Great Britain in 2012 because of
 bovine TB.’
