Two Dutchmen have been jailed for a total of 36 years after being convicted of a 'James Bond'-style plot to smuggle £16.2million of cocaine into Britain using underwater vehicles.

Henri Van Doesburg, 68, and Arnold Van Milt, 49, helped to transport 240lbs (108kg) of the class A drug to the UK in the rudder compartment of Colombian ship Cape Maria.

While the ship was moored in Scotland, the pair planned to use underwater Seabob vehicles to dive down and collect the drugs, which were hidden behind a hatch that could be opened from outside.

Henri Van Doesburg, 68, has been jailed for 20 years, while Arnold Van Milt, 49, has been jailed for 16 years, after police uncovered a plot to smuggle £16.2million of cocaine into the UK using underwater vehicles

Police found 50 packets, totalling 240lbs (108kgs) of high-purity cocaine, stored in the rudder compartment of Colombian ship Cape Maria while it was moored off the coast of Scotland

Officers arrested Van Milt near to where the ship was moored, and when they searched his car they found Seabob underwater vehicles (pictured) which could be used to smuggle drugs off the ship

Van Milt was caught after customs officials discovered 50 packages of high-purity cocaine on the boat and arrested him in Seamill, near to where the boat was moored. 

Officers then searched his car, where they found a ribbed motorboat with a powerful engine, Seabob underwater vehicles, wet suits, and other scuba equipment.

Van Doesburg was arrested in Aalsmeer, in the Netherlands, the next day after officers seized an encrypted Blackberry mobile that Van Milt was using to contact him.

Officers also found Van Doesburg had been tracking the ship on his home computer, and used this information to locate him.

Van Milt was jailed for 16 years and Van Doesburg for 20 years after being found guilty of conspiracy to import cocaine at Leeds Crown Court.

Van Doesburg's son Roderick, 23 and grandson Darryl-Jay, 22, were also both arrested in Seamill, but were acquitted of similar charges after a four-week trial. 

Officers began tracking Van Doesburg in May, when he was seen meeting to two English men in a bar in Amsterdam, where the group were heard discussing 'diving'.

After officers arrested Van Milt they traced Van Doesburg via an encrypted Blackberry mobile. He was arrested in Holland the next day, and information on his laptop connected him to the drugs

Investigators searching Van Milt's car also found a ribbed boat (pictured) along with wetsuits and scuba diving gear which formed part of his 'specialist drug retrieval service'

Prosecutors likened the plot to a James Bond-style heist which had been planned for months in advance

Officers then managed to get hold of papers from the meeting that were covered with calculations and telephone numbers. 

Van Doesburg was picked up again alongside Van Milt when the pair arrived in the UK on April 29 on the Rotterdam to Hull ferry, driving a car that was towing a ribbed boat.

They then visited a B&Q in Grimsby to buy tools before booking into a hotel in Cleethorpes.

When police arrested Van Milt and searched his car, they found a ribbed boat with a high powered engine, a Seabob underwater vehicle, and scuba gear.

The drugs were stored in a hatch underneath the Cape Maria near the rudder, which could be opened from the outside.

Prosecutors said the scuba gear and Seabob would be used to dive down under the ship using the cover of darkness.

Once there, Milt could have retrieved the 240lbs haul of cocaine, worth £16.2million.

In the style of James Bond, the Seabob vehicle would be used to make a speedy underwater getaway.

The ribbed boat could have been used to transport Van Milt to a location near the Cape Maria, but out of sight, before he switched to the Seabob.

On May 1 the pair picked up Roderick and Darryl-Jay from Leeds Bradford Airport. RNLI lifeboat officers saw some of the men regularly going out to sea in their boat.

After dropping Van Doesburg back at Leeds Bradford Airport on May 5, the others headed for Scotland and stayed in hotels in the Largs area. 

CCTV showed them visiting a Halfords store in Greenock to buy camping equipment and C&C Marine Services in Largs to enquire about hiring diving equipment.

The trio were arrested on May 9 after border officials found the drugs hidden in a rudder compartment of the Cape Maria which could be opened from the outside.

The team also found cut ropes hanging from the hatch, suggesting it had been used before.

When officers caught up with Van Doesburg in Holland the following day they seized his laptops and found information linking him to the Cape Maria.

From documents on his computers, they discovered the Cape Maria on two previous occasions in January and March this year.

Officers were also able to link Van Doesburg to two other ships, the Indian Friendship and the Florentina, which were also discovered to be carrying cocaine.

Sentencing the two men, Judge James Spencer QC said: 'It seems to me, despite your mature years, the two of you were out to make money, the two of you played for high stakes and the two of you have lost.

'Now you stand, the two of you, convicted of a very serious offence involving the agreement to import class A drugs into this country, into the UK. 

Prosecutors revealed the drugs were hidden in a rudder compartment of this ship which could be opened from the outside. The Seabobs and diving equipment were to be used to go down and extract the illicit haul

As well as the Cape Maria, information on Van Doesburg's laptop linked him to two other boats, the Indian Friendship and the Florentina, that were also stopped while carrying cocaine

'It was on a scale which can readily be said to be commercial for the quantity was well over 100kg with a potential street value of over £16million.

'The evidence, it seems to me, is clear that you Henri Van Doesburg and you Arnold Van Milt were involved in this scheme in a leading role because the two of you went to Columbia and no doubt there organised the sourcing and also the stowing of this material.'

David Norris, National Crime Agency branch commander, said: 'The underwater scooter was like something out of a Bond movie. 

'These criminals were going to use it to dive beneath the ship under the cover of darkness and recover the cocaine worth tens of millions of pounds.

'Van Doesburg and Van Milt provide a specialist drug retrieval service for organised crime groups, and we have linked them to other ships that have been intercepted carrying cocaine.

Jailing Van Doesburg and Van Milt (pictured) at Leeds Crown Court, Judge James Spencer QC said the pair had 'played for high stakes and lost'

Judge Spencer also noted that both of the men were clearly leading the plot, as they had both traveled to Colombia, with the likely aim of sourcing the cocaine to be transported

'Van Milt posed as a tourist while in Scotland and bought camping equipment as part of the cover story.

'By preventing them providing more of their services, the NCA and its partners have disrupted criminal activity beyond this one operation. There will be some very frustrated criminals out there today.'

Sir Charles Montgomery, director-general of Border Force, said: 'This was an excellent seizure that stopped millions of pounds worth of harmful drugs making their way on to the streets of this country.'
