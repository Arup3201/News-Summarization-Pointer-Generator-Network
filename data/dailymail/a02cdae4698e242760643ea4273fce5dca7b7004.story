This is the shocking moment a U.S. marine appears to savagely beat a taxi driver in a drunken attack which left the cabbie needing facial surgery.

John Adam Kinosh is alleged to have repeatedly smashed driver Charles Hawkesworth across the face after becoming argumentative with the taxi driver in Surf City, North Carolina.

The driver told how Kinosh allegedly became enraged at being told to split his fare in the early hours of Sunday morning, after ordering a cab home.

Scarred: Hawkesworth said the attack left him with facial fractures and needing 15 stitches

The marine, a Gunnery Sgt assigned to Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command, allegedly battered the driver around the head after an argument, leaving him with multiple facial fractures and needing 15 stitches.

The 30-year-old marine now faces two counts of assault inflicting serious injury and one count of communicating threat, according to NBC affiliate WECT.

A dashboard camera appeared to catch most of the shocking attack, which Hawkesworth said began when he picked up Kinosh from the Trailer Bar in Surf City to take him home.

It is alleged that Kinosh climbed into the front seat and became confrontational after being told he would have to split his cab due to the high volume of calls that night.

The taxi driver then told how Kinosh attacked him, after which he said 'all I could see was blood'.

Hawkesworth told WWAY: 'He was really confrontational from the get-go.

'When he started screaming at me, I knew at that point I was probably going to get hit.'

Jerry Coston, a dispatcher for Island Taxi, told the Jacksonville Daily News: 'We were trying to turn a $25 fare into a $12 fare for [Kinosh] and he got all upset.

The cab driver, pictured before the attack, said that immediately after the beating, 'All I could see was blood'.

'From what I understand (the passenger) was pretty intoxicated.'

Reports earlier this week said Kinosh has since checked himself into a psychiatric unit and is being served with warrants upon his release.

Hawkesworth is awaiting surgery to his facial injuries, but plans to return to work as he said he 'loves being a cab driver'.
