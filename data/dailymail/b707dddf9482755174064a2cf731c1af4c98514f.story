A small village in Staffordshire is fighting to keep the name of their local pub and its original signage which shows a black boy being scrubbed in the bath by a white couple.

Yarnsfield locals have battled for 20 years to keep the sign in the 166-year-old Labour In Vain pub, after it was first removed in 1994 after two 10-year-old girls complained. It was then replaced by a farmer sowing seeds. 

In 2001, then-licensees Christine and John Glover found the sign and hung it in the beer garden, prompting the Stafford and District Racial Equality Council to request it be removed from view. The sign was given less prominence, but remained on display in the garden.

A small village in Staffordshire is fighting to keep the name of their local pub - Labour In Vain - and its original signage which shows a black boy being scrubbed in the bath by a white couple

The original sign, featuring a white couple engaged  trying to scrub a black boy white, was removed in 1994 after two young girls complained that it was racist; it was then subject to a council letter in 2001 asking for it to be removed from view, before being displayed again in 2009

In 2009 Vince Hannant and Debbie Donovan took over the pub and again there was talk that the 'sign should come down'.

But at the time Mr Hannant was reported as saying the locals told him, 'Don't even touch it, we've been though so much to keep it.'

Pub regular Richard Charwood was said to have then arranged a referendum of villagers to find out if they wanted to keep it. They were reportedly overwhelmingly in favour of doing so.  

The pub is presently closed undergoing renovations, and the owner, Enterprise brewery, has said it is now considering changing the name, but won't say what they might change it to.

The future of the controversial sign also remains unclear. A Enterprise spokeswoman said 'no decision' has been made about whether it will remain as part of the pubs' fixtures and decorations. 

It is understood that Enterprise may rename the pub the Yarnfield Arms.

Pub regular Jimmy Cawdell, 56, said: 'If it goes ahead, which we're sure it will, it will be political correctness gone mad.

'We are too upset about offending people these days, even if it means sacrificing our pub heritage.

'Everybody is outraged. There is not one person who uses this pub that thinks the name or the sign is racist.

'It should stay as it is because the pub is an integral part of the village's history.'

Local John Rogers, 80, said he fears the pub and village will lose its identity and its heritage if the name is changed.

He added: 'It has been called the Labour In Vain for more than 100 years.

'They only want to change the name to attract interest and deceive people into thinking it's a new pub.

'I hope the people in the village boycott a new name, I really do.' 

The original sign was replaced with this one, showing a field being attacked by gulls immediately after being ploughed; the pub's new owner, Enterprise, is now considering changing its name and it is not known if the original sign will remain at the premises

Diane Lander, who runs Yarnfield Post Office, has set up a petition that has so far gained 300 signatures.

The 47-year-old said: ' There is strong opposition against it. It has been the Labour In Vain for 166 years. '

Brian Eyre, who sits on Yarnfield Parish Council, added: 'In the past there a little bit of aggravation on the name and the sign because it is not seen as politically correct and caused a race row.

'I can understand why the people in the village want to retain the name as it is part of our heritage.'

But Mr Eyre said he also understood why Enterprise might want to change the pub's name.

'In the 25 years I have lived here the pub has closed a couple of times and the tenants don't seem to survive very long.

'It has to be a positive that Enterprise wants to invest the pub and village because at the moment it's not particularly attractive.' 

A spokesman for Enterprise Inns said: 'We are currently reviewing several options for this popular village pub with the aim of having it back open and trading at the heart of the Yarnfield community as soon as possible.'
