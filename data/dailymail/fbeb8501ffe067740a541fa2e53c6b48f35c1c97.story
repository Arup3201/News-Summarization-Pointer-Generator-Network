Sweeping new anti-terror laws were published by the Government today - less than 24 hours after a damning Parliamentary report into the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby by Islamist fanatics.

A new Counter-terrorism and Security Bill, containing a range of draconian powers including orders to block suspected British jihadists  from returning to the UK, was introduced to Parliament.

It comes after an official report into the May 2013 murder of Fusilier Rigby revealed a series of missed opportunities by the security services to prevent the attack.

The increasing threat against Britain has seen the Government introduce sweeping new anti-terror powers

The new counter-terror legislation will ban insurance companies from footing the bill for terrorist ransoms and powers will be re-introduced to relocate terror suspects across the country.

A statutory duty will be placed on named organisations - such as colleges, universities, the police and probation providers - to help deter radicalisation and, where organisations fail, ministers will be able to issue court-enforced directions to them.

Police are to be handed powers in the new bill to force internet firms to hand over details that could help identify suspected terrorists and paedophiles, while police and border staff will be given the power to seize the passports of terror suspects.

Its second reading in Parliament - the first opportunity for MPs to debate the main principles of the bill - will take place tomorrow.

Home Secretary Theresa May the bill included a ‘considered, targeted set of proposals that will help to keep us safe at a time of very significant danger by ensuring we have the powers we need to defend ourselves’.

But Amnesty International accused the government of ‘rushing through’ a ‘grab-bag of measures without proper scrutiny or challenge’.

David Cameron yesterday announced an extra £130million would be handed to the security services to help identify lone wolf terrorists.

Mr Cameron vowed to take steps to try to ensure the police, MI5 and MI6 can successfully fight back against plots.

The PM also revealed new laws, set to be introduced to Parliament tomorrow, would help move terror suspects away from their extremist associates and strip passports from people trying to travel into war zones.

The PM said: ‘We will not shrink from doing what is necessary to keep our people safe.'

Yesterday's long-awaited report into Fusilier Rigby's killing revealed that the two killers - Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale - had appeared in seven different investigations by MI5 and MI6 before they launched their attack.

Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee criticised the security services for 'delays' in their investigations which at times was 'inadequate.'

But it said given what the agencies knew at the time 'they were not in a position to prevent the murder of Fusilier Rigby'.

However it slammed giant internet firms for failing to hand over key pieces of information which might have helped security chiefs stop the attacks.

It said Adebowale detailed a threat to kill a soldier, posted on his Facebook account in December 2012, was 'highly significant'.

In the most explosive section of the report, it states: 'Had MI5 had access to this exchange at the time, Adebowale would have become a top priority. There is then a significant possibility that MI5 would have been able to prevent the attack.'

The main findings of the report also included:

David Cameron told MPs he would not introduce emergency laws in response to today's report but said there were lessons to be learnt

US social media giant Facebook allegedly failed to close down Michael Adebowale's personal account - even after he used it to post explicit threats to kill a soldier.

Today's report said: 'They left the one that said…“Let’s kill a soldier”. That didn’t meet their criteria [for closure].'

While MPs and peers refused to name the company in question, it was later reported to be Facebook. 

The report criticised internet companies for their refusal to cooperate with security services to help stop terror attacks.

It said it was 'clear' that social media companies could have 'made a difference' if they alerted British authorities to online messages in which Adebowale threatened to kill a soldier.

The report says the company which hosted the terror exchange 'does not regard themselves as under any obligation to ensure that they identify such threats, or to report them to the authorities'.

It added: 'We find this unacceptable: however unintentionally, they are providing a safe haven for terrorists.

None of the major US companies the committee approached proactively monitor and review suspicious content on their systems, largely relying on users to notify them of offensive or suspicious content.

None of them regard themselves as compelled to comply with UK warrants obtained under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.

That means that even if MI5 had a warrant for the information before the attack, the company might not have responded.

Adebolajo and Adebowale ran down Fusilier Rigby, who was dressed in a Help for Heroes hoodie, in a Vauxhall Tigra near Woolwich Barracks, in south-east London, before savagely attacking the defenceless soldier as he lay in the road.

As armed police arrived, the two men charged the vehicle, with Adebowale brandishing a rusted, unloaded revolver. They were both shot at the scene.

The killers were convicted of murder at the Old Bailey in December last year and were later sentenced to whole life and life with a minimum of 45 years respectively. 

A terrorist magazine which acts as a guide for fanatics to carry out atrocities in the West is still available online – despite being the inspiration for Lee Rigby’s murder.

‘Inspire’, a quarterly journal for extremists, is a ‘pernicious’ threat which ‘exhorts violent action and gives recipes on how to do so’, the committee said.

The report states: 'MI5 has told the Committee of the link between Inspire and individuals involved in planning UK attacks:

‘We can now say that Inspire has been read by those involved in at least seven out of the ten attacks planned within the UK since its first issue [in 2010].

Labour MP Hazel Blears has demanded a crack down on extremist material

‘We judge that it significantly enhanced the capability of individuals in four of these ten attack plots.’

Despite the influence of the Al Qaeda magazine MailOnline was able to download the latest edition – Spring 2014 – within minutes of today’s publication.

In the online journal, it tells extremists that ‘America is our first target, followed by the United Kingdom, France and other crusader countries.’

It directs terrorists to bomb Premier League games, tennis tournaments – and even the Savoy hotel.

It tells jihadists: 'You have the soccer (football) stadiums especially during Premier League and FA Cup matches. They have worldwide live media coverage.

'In the beginning of summer, we have Cheltenham, and the end of summer we have Epsom, hereby horse races are attended by thousands from around the kingdom including the Queen.

'There are also Tennis tournaments.'

Today’s report said it should be ‘sufficient grounds’ for the security services to launch surveillance on anyone caught reading the magazine.

It stated: 'Engagement with extremist media should be taken extremely seriously. For example, Inspire magazine provides advice and guidance to individuals on how to commit terrorist attacks in the UK.

‘In most cases, engaging with extremist media such as Inspire should be sufficient grounds to justify intrusive action.'

MI5 delayed submitting an application to monitor Adebowale before he struck in May last year;

@highlight

Without the delay  MI5 would 'probably' have set up surveillance on Adebowale in 'the days before the attack’;

@highlight

The application was sitting on the Home Secretary Theresa May’s desk at the time of the killing - having only been handed in the day before;

@highlight

MI5 were trailing Adebowale's accomplice Adebolajo from December 2012 to April 2013;

@highlight

However, undercover agents did not discover anything of ‘national security concern’;

@highlight

This meant that MI5 had to cancel their surveillance of Adebolago in April 2013 – just weeks before the attack.
