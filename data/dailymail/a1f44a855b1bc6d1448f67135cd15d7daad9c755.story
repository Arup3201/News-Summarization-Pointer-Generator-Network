This photograph, released by the White House on Thursday, reveals the terrible moment when President Barack Obama was told the shocking news about the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

The President, who has described the day of the shootings as the ‘worst day of my presidency,’ is seen bowing his head and closing his eyes as John Brennan, his deputy national security adviser, informs him about the tragic events unfolding in Newtown, Connecticut.

In the wake of the tragedy, the president has tasked his deputy Joe Biden with leading a task force to look at proposals to tighten current firearms legislation.

'The worst day of my presidency': Barack Obama receives the horrific news about the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

Back to school: Sandy Hook students wave on their way to their new school, with one young boy holding up his fingers in a sign Americans recognise as a peace sign

In Newtown, the surviving children of the Sandy Hook 
Elementary School massacre returned to classes on Thursday for the first time 
since the killing, relocating to a refurbished school in a nearby town.

On
 a day laced with worry for the families, children were pictured 
boarding buses, while police officers stood guard outside the school to 
check IDs of parents dropping off their sons and daughters.

In
 one particularly striking image, a young boy aboard a yellow school bus
 held his fingers in a peace sign as the vehicle passed memorials and 
welcoming signs on its new route.

With
 their original school still being treated as a crime scene, the more 
than 400 students are now attending a school, formerly known as Chalk 
Hill School, in the neighboring town of Monroe.

The site has taken the name Sandy Hook 
Elementary School - known as the place where six staff members and 20 children lost their 
lives on December 14 - after discussions with staff.

Police officers have been guarding the new school and a senior officer described it as 'the safest school in America'.

Journey: Parents were encouraged to put their children on the bus so they can return to their normal routines

The school district said parents who 
wanted to be close to their children could stay in classrooms or an 
auditorium throughout the first day, but they were encouraged to take 
their children to the bus to help them return to their routine.

Newtown Superintendent of Schools Janet Robinson said the school has been transformed into a 'cheerful' place for the students to resume normal school routines.

She said mental health counselors are available for anyone who needs them.

'We will go to our regular schedule,' she said. 'We will be doing a normal day.'

Teams of workers, many of them volunteers, prepared the school with fresh paint and new furniture and even raised bathroom 
floors so the smaller elementary school students can reach the toilets.

The students' desks, backpacks and other belongings that were left 
behind following the shooting were taken to the new school to make them 
feel at home.

Several signs welcoming the students to their new school were
 posted along the road leading to the school in a rural, mostly 
residential neighborhood. One said 'Welcome Sandy Hook Elementary Kids,'
 while a similar sign added 'You are in our prayers.'

On Wednesday, the students and their 
families were welcomed at an open house at their new school, and students
 received gift boxes with toys inside and shared joyful reunions with 
teachers.

One father, Vinny Alvarez, thanked his third-grade daughter's teacher, Courtney Martin, who protected the class by locking her classroom door and keeping the children in a corner.

'Everybody there thanked her in their own way,' he said.

Of his eight-year-old daughter, Cynthia, he added: 'I'm not worried about her going back. The fear kind of kicks back in a little bit, but we're very excited 
for her and we got to see many, many kids today. The atmosphere was very
 cheerful.'

'New old principal': Donna Page, left, has stepped in as acting school principal after Dawn Hochsprung, right, was killed at the school. Ms Page said she felt compelled to come out of retirement to step in

On Wednesday, numerous police officers on guarded the outside of the Monroe school, which is about seven miles from the old school, and told reporters to stay away.

'I think right now it has to be the safest school in America,' Monroe police Lt. Keith White said.

Acting
 Sandy Hook principal Donna Page wrote on the school's website: 'Be 
assured that the towns of Monroe and Newtown are working night and day 
to ensure the facility is safe, secure and fully operational for our 
return.'

She took on the role after the 
elementary school's principal Dawn Hochsprung was killed in the attack 
and parents are now calling Ms Page the 'new old principal' as she led 
the school for 14 years before retiring in 2010.

School superintendent Janet Robinson said the decision to re-name the new school as Sandy Hook Elementary School was taken by the teachers from the previous school

There had been concern about who would lead the school, parent Karen Dryer told ABC News.

'We got a voicemail from Donna 
reintroducing herself and saying that when she heard [about the 
shooting] she knew it was the calling that she needed to come out of 
retirement and take the position of head of school,' Dryer said.

'I started crying when I heard the message. It's still emotional. It was such a blessing and such an amazing relief because it was like, "Oh my, now we can breathe. They're going to be okay".'

Robinson
 announced on Wednesday that the former Chalk Hill Middle School in 
Monroe had been renamed after a decision was taken by staff from the 
previous Sandy Hook school.

'That's who they are,' she said. 'They're the Sandy Hook family.'

Robinson added that renaming the Chalk Hill school will allow staff and students to keep 'their identity and a comfort level'.

The
 school where the shootings occurred remains closed and guarded by 
police. Newtown officials haven't decided yet on the building's future.

Teachers are returning as well, and 
some have already been working on their classrooms. At some point, all 
those will be honored, but officials are still working out how and when 
to do so, Robinson said.

'Everyone was part and parcel of getting as many kids out of there safely as they could,' she said.

'Almost everybody did something to 
save kids. One art teacher locked her kids in the kiln room, and I got a
 message from her on my cellphone saying she wouldn't come out until she
 saw a police badge.'Sandy students return to class...as school is surrounded by police patrols
