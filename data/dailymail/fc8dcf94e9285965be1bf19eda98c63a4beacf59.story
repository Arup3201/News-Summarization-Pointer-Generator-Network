A couple booking a two-week holiday to Greece were left £600 out of pocket after they paid extra for a holiday bungalow, only to be put in a hotel room on arrival.

Ken  Marlow, 68, and his wife Dorothy, 58, wanted to stay at the Belvedere Hotel on the Greek island of Skiathos, but were disappointed to be told by Thomas Cook that the rooms were fully booked.

Instead, the holiday company offered the couple, from Moorside, Sunderland, a stay in a bungalow on the property for £578.86 more.

Ken and Dorothy Marlow have received a full refund after they were overcharged by more than half of the overall booking for a bungalow they never even got to stay in

However, when the couple arrived at the resort, they were told the bungalows were fully booked and they would instead be placed in a double room.

The Marlows complained when they got home and despite admitting the brochure was 'confusing', Thomas Cook initially refused to refund the full amount.

Mr Marlow was contacted by Thomas Cook's customer relations department which admitted the brochure description was 'really confusing.'  

The pensioner was offered just £260 in vouchers or £209 in cash in a full and final settlement but neither amount covered what he had been overcharged.

However, after local newspapers took up the battle, the couple have now been given an apology, refund, and compensation from Thomas Cook.

The couple have accepted £700 after the company blamed a 'technical fault' for charging too much.

The Marlows have been given a full refund, plus compensation after the booking blunder

Mr Marlow said: 'I went to the Thomas Cook shop to book a holiday with a twin/double room at the Belvedere Hotel & Bungalows at Achladies, Skiathos, Greece.

'The sales assistant told me no twin/double rooms were available on our chosen dates. 

'There was, however, a family bungalow for three or four persons but I would have to pay extra for under occupancy.

'Having studied the brochure we decided the Belvedere was where we wanted to stay, so I agreed, and looked forward to having a bit more room to spread out.' 

On arrival, however, it was a completely different story. Mr Marlow, said: 'We were told that no bungalows were available and that we would have to stay in a double room.

'This, of course, was what we had wanted all along but a holiday that should have cost £1,118 cost me, somehow, £1,696.86, meaning I was overcharged by £578.86.

'It seems Thomas Cook and the Belvedere were not using the same data and, therefore, there was wrong information in the brochure.' 

The company admitted in email correspondence that the brochure was 'confusing' but refused to compensate to the amount Mr Marlow had been overcharged.

The Marlows, from Sunderland, arrived at the Belvedere Hotel & Bungalows at Achladies, Skiathos, Greece to be told their booking for a bungalow was not possible

A spokesman for the company said: 'At Thomas Cook we pride ourselves on offering the best value holidays in the market. We would like to express our apologies to Mr Marlow for the inconvenience of additional charges incurred while on holiday.

'These were due to a pricing discrepancy caused by a technical fault at the time of booking. 

'Thomas Cook would like to reassure customers that such pricing errors are rare and a full investigation has been carried out to ensure that there are no further issues of this nature.

'We can confirm that Mr Marlow has now accepted a full refund for the extra costs and has stated that he is looking forward to booking his next holiday with Thomas Cook.' 

Thomas Cook said that that the difference between what Mr Marlow was charged and what he should have been charged had been fully refunded - despite the earlier refusal - and they had also offered a gesture of goodwill by way of apology. 

Mr Marlow said he was delighted with the result. 

'They have refunded what I wanted all along and rounded the amount up to £700,' he added.
