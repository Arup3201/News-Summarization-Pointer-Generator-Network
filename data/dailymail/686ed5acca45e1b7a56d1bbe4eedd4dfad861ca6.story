After a photograph of  a grizzly bear posed perfectly behind a camera became an online sensation, a video has emerged showing what really happened that day.

Wildlife photographer Jim Lawrence had set up his camera close to the Kootenay National Park in British Columbia, Canada, in hopes of snapping some of the varied animal life native to the area.

But he wasn't expecting this particular visitor... 

A photograph of a grizzly bear posing next to a camera in British Columbia, Canada has recently gone viral 

Now, new footage has emerged showing exactly what led to that incredible photograph

The bear strolled over to the camera tripod to see what the fuss was all about, before pulling himself up and looking at the buttons and lens.

Eventually, he put his paw up and gently tugged on the strap - causing the camera to pivot unexpectedly.

The bear quickly scurried away in surprise and headed back down the bank and off of the road.

But the bear had other plans and instead walked directly to the camera. Jim, thankfully, had another camera ready to record it

'I set up my camera to get a photo of him across the way, but I should know better than to guess what a bear's going to do,' Lawrence told The Huffington Post Canada in an interview.

'For the longest time, he studied the screen and buttons and with his big, long-nailed paw, gently tugged on the strap.'

After the scare, the bear 'shrugged and went back to fishing.'

The bear examined the camera for several seconds, before pulling down on the strap - and causing the camera to pivot unexpectedly

The action spooked the bear and he scurried off and back into the forest

Though Lawrence often spends time in the Kootenay National Park area, he admitted that he'd never experienced an event like this before.

Nevertheless, he shared his tips for other wildlife photographers with Huffington Post B.C.

'Carry bear spray. Keep a safe distance. Get your picture and move along.'
