Heirs of the late movie legend John Wayne are suing Duke University for the right to use the actor's iconic nickname to promote their alcoholic beverages.

Wayne's family wants to sell products featuring the Hollywood star's nickname and image, but the North Carolina university says it doesn't want anyone to think it sponsors the booze.

John Wayne Enterprises filed a
 lawsuit in Orange County federal court on Thursday, claiming its trademarks don't violate Duke University's rights or cause confusion.

In their complaint, JWE say it’s 'ludicrous' to think anyone would believe Duke University had endorsed a bottle of bourbon featuring Wayne’s photo and signature with a shotgun shell casing.

'Duke is a common word that has been in use for centuries in a wide array of commercial and other applications wholly independent of Duke University,' the complaint says.

'Yet by the actions alleged herein, Duke University seems to think it owns the word ‘Duke’ for all purposes and applications.'

The school has not formally responded to the complaint, however spokesman Michael Schoenfeld told OC Register: 'We admire and respect John Wayne’s contributions to American culture, but as The Duke himself once said, ‘Words are what men live by … words they say and mean'.'

No court dates have been set.

According to the complaint, the trademark war began in 2005 when Duke filed an objection with the US Patent and Trademark Office after the family tried to register the nickname in connection with restaurant services.

Duke University has consistently argued that trademarks sought or obtained by the actor’s heirs are 'substantially similar' to the school’s trademarks, which could confuse consumers.

According to federal records, the university in Durham has several trademarks for logos used to sell 
products such as stickers and drinking glasses, but it doesn't sell alcoholic beverages.

Last year, Duke University filed oppositions to two 
new trademarks JWE sought for alcoholic beverages, one with the moniker 'Duke' and the other with Wayne’s photo and signature. 

According to the complaint, John Wayne was given the nickname 'Duke' as a boy by firefighters in his Iowa hometown. It was the name of his dog.
