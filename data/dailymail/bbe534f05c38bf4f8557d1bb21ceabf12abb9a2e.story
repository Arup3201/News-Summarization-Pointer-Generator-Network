Bad blood? Millionaire founder of the Carrabba's restaurant chain Damian Mandola (pictured) was arrested twice in three days for allegedly breaking into a Texas winery he once co-owned

A millionaire restauranteur was arrested twice last week on charges he drove a golf cart to a Texas winery he once co-owned to settle a score by stealing a bottle of wine and taunting employees.

Carrabba's Restaurants co-founder Damian Mandola was photographed Saturday carrying a hammer that Duchman Family Winery staff say he used to damage property and threaten them physically.

Just two days before, cops booked and released the 61-year-old for driving his golf cart erratically before allegedly breaking into the winery to steal his former partner's stock.

Mandola, who founded the national 
Carrabba's chain with his nephew, was charged with burglary for the 
incident on Thursday, for which police picked him up near his Trattoria 
Lisina restaurant, which is adjacent to the Driftwood, Texas winery.

Mandola
 removed his name from the award-winning winery after a falling out with
 the Duchman family in 2010 that has apparently left some lingering bad 
blood.

Whatever the reason for this most recent emotional flareup, Mandola was not satisfied with his first visit to the winery.

He posted $5,000 bond and was released from the Hays county Jail on Thursday.

On Saturday, a staff member who spoke to the Houston Press on the condition of anonymity said he came back.

The worker said he noticed a damaged sign before he saw Mandola coming towards him with a hammer and a knife.

Tough times? The chain he co-founded with his nephew now has hundreds of locations across America. Nonetheless, he's accused of breaking into the Duchman Family Winery to steal a bottle of wine

'I
 headed outside,' said the employee 'and upon reaching the corner of the
 building I heard a tire burst, which was the tire of my Toyota Tacoma. 
As I rounded the corner I witnessed Damian smash the back window of my 
truck.'

The employee 
told police Mandola brandished his 'deadly weapons' at him and called 
him 'a few choice names' before speeding away on his golf cart.

Mandola
 reappeared later that day while a wedding was being held at the winery,
 when the employee said he continued to taunt him.

Mandola was subsequently arrested and has since made $15,000 bail.
