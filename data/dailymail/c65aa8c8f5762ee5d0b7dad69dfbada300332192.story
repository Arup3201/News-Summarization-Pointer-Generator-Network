THE DIARY OF LENA MUKHINA

This is a story within a story — and it has been waiting an awfully long time to be told.

The larger story is the Siege of Leningrad in 1941 and 1942, one of the grimmer and more brutal narratives of World War II.

In September 1941, the invading German army, with the help of Finnish forces, had the Russian city completely surrounded.

But Hitler decided that finishing the job and razing it to the ground would be a waste of military resources. Far easier just to let the inhabitants starve to death.

Lena Mukhina, 16 (pictured), experience the Siege of Leningrad first hand and recorded it all in her diary

As the German Naval Command’s directive of September 29 put it: ‘We have no interest in saving any part of the civilian population of this large city.’

The story within this story is that of Lena Mukhina, a 16-year-old girl who lived there. Between May 1941 and May 1942, she kept a diary — a day-to-day record of encroaching catastrophe.

Unlike Anne Frank, she survived. In June 1942, Lena was evacuated and the diary was left behind. Somehow it, too, survived and turned up in a sheaf of documents at the State Archive of Historical-Political Documents in Leningrad 20 years later.

But it has taken another 50 years to come into print, guided and nurtured by a trio of Russian researchers.

In late summer 1941, life in Leningrad was going on much as normal. The city’s 2.5 million inhabitants did not immediately grasp the severity of their situation. True, they could almost see the Germans to the south of the city. Daily air raids and artillery bombardment were driving people into bomb shelters several times a day, for hours at a time.

But the Finnish troops to the north were no threat, surely? They were 20 miles away and had no big guns.

In November, however, food supplies were running perilously short and the authorities had to admit the truth.

The siege lasted 872 days. Bread rations were eventually reduced to 125g, 4½ oz, per person per day. (Double that for manual workers.)

People would start queueing outside shops early in the morning, but there was never enough to go round.

New dishes were invented, such as khryapa, made from the green outer leaves of a head of cabbage. People ate crows, pigeons, cats and dogs. Lena’s family cat, she records, kept them going for ten days (‘I never thought cat meat would be so tender and so tasty’).

Under siege: Citizens of wartime Leningrad died of starvation in the streets, and some turned to cannibalism

Eventually, hunger drove some of the most desperate to cannibalism. Our Russian editors, possibly precise to a fault, distinguish between two kinds: trupoedstvo, eating the flesh of those who have died of natural causes; and lyudoedstvo, killing others for the purpose. More than 2,000 arrests were made during the siege for such crimes.

And yet, as Lena’s writing here shows, most of the city’s inhabitants kept a firm grasp on their humanity. Their stoicism and determination were almost heartbreaking, for the death toll was horrendous. In one week in December 1941, 841 people dropped dead of starvation on the street.

Between January and April 1942, between 110 and 160 people were dying every hour. No one knows exactly how many died in all, but 800,000 is the historians’ best guess.

When Lena’s diary begins, war has yet to be declared. There are exams to revise for, and she worries incessantly whether Vova, the boy she likes, has feelings for her.

I have a daughter of the same age and similar preoccupations and, in some ways, I found these the hardest pages of the book to read — the innocence set against the reader’s terrible sense of impending doom.

Then, Germany invades. Hitler may have been happy to wait for the inhabitants to die of starvation, but he wanted to break their spirits first. More than 13,000 artillery missiles, 3,500 high-explosive bombs and nearly 56,000 incendiary bombs landed on the city in the first three months of the siege.

Then came the worst blow of all: Lena’s mother dies. ‘I still can’t believe it. It hasn’t fully sunk in. But already, I feel the emptiness of loneliness descending upon me. The love we felt for one another cannot be put into words. Such love can only exist between a mother and daughter . . .

‘I’m in so much pain. I’m trembling all over. This is it, the first blow. I’m still only 16, and I’ve already been dealt the first blow. What else does fate have in store for me? I don’t know.

‘Thousands of people are dying on the frontline and some of them are 16-year-old boys, the same age as me.’ That very much captures her tone — sweet, ingenuous, incredibly young in every way, but with the soul of a writer, and one or two of the skills, too.

As the food supplies dwindle and malnutrition threatens, she begins to lose hope. ‘It is starting to seem as though it’s no longer our destiny to see brighter days. It’s no longer our destiny to live until the bright, joyous month of May.’

She and her aunt fantasise about the glorious meals they will eat when it’s all over. When the old woman who shares their flat dies, all they can think about is whether they will be able to keep her ration card until it expires later in the month. But they can’t.

When the body goes, the ration card has to go, too.

Generations of eminent historians have told and retold the story of Leningrad, but you can’t beat the raw immediacy of first- person testimony.

I’ll admit that, when I first started the book, I did wonder, is this for real? But you can’t fake this sort of thing. Her suffering is real and terrible.

As we read on, we can feel something important sapping out of her. Call it spirit, if you like, or the optimism of youth.

But adversity does not strengthen her; it corrodes her. She gets away, but the best of her, we suspect, she has left behind.

Thanks to our assiduous Russians, we now know that Lena spent the rest of the war in Gorky, returned to Leningrad in 1945 to study mosaics at the School of Arts and Crafts, had a long and varied career in design and died in Moscow in 1991.

But, as far they could ascertain, she never wrote another word.

Indeed, when they contacted her niece, ‘the initial response at the other end of the line was confusion: “Yes, we know Elena Vladimirova Mukhina. What diary? She wrote it during the siege? She never mentioned it.”’

For some reason that I can’t put my finger on, this almost seems the saddest thing of all.
