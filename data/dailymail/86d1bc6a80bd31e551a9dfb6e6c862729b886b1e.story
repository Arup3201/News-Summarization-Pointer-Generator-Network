Jedi, druid and pagan weddings could be made legal across Britain under proposals from MPs, it was claimed last night.

They want to change the law to allow humanist weddings, for couples who do not want a religious or civil marriage to express their commitment.

But Tories say such an amendment would ‘dilute’ the institution of marriage by allowing other ‘ridiculous’ sects to marry couples.

Tories fear pagan marriage ceremonies like this one in Glastonbury could undermine the principle of marriage if they are legalised

In Scotland, where humanist weddings have been legal since 2005, marriages have also been solemnized by the Spiritualists National Union, the Pagan Federation and a faith healing group called the White Eagle Lodge.

Humanism, which has around 40,000 followers in Britain, is based on ‘reason and humanity’ rather than religious belief. In Scotland there were 2,400 humanist weddings last year, outnumbering Catholic ceremonies.

Its practitioners carry out around 600 wedding ceremonies a year in England and Wales, but these have no legal force so the couples who have them must also be married by a registrar.

MPs are trying to amend the same sex marriage bill, the controversial legislation to allow gay weddings, to allow humanist weddings to have legal force too. It will be voted on next week.

But government sources say if they are empowered to carry out marriages, it will be impossible to stop other sects going to court to claim the same power on the grounds of discrimination.

A government source said: ‘Marriage is hugely important and binds families and society together. We believe allowing same-sex couples to tie the knot will strengthen marriage by making it more relevant in modern society.

‘But proposals such as this which seek to undermine and dilute the institution of marriage by creating a two-tiered system are ridiculous. We have a fundamentally different marriage system to the one in Scotland and while they may be open to pagans, spiritualists and Jedi’s conducting marriages, we are not.

The 2011 Census registered 175,000 Jedi Knights - inspired by the Star Wars films

‘In Scotland there have already been pagan marriages, white eagle lodge marriages and the spiritualist union. We would not be able to justify making special provision for the humanists and not for other belief organisations, as it would be open to legal challenge.’

The 2011 census listed more than 175,000 Jedi Knights – the most popular choice of ‘Other Religion’. There were 56,620 pagans in the UK. 2,418 Scientologists, 1,893 Satanists. 11,766 followers of Wicca, and 4,189 druids.

Andrew Copson, of the British Humanist Association, said: ‘The amendment will give legal recognition to humanist weddings, and it refers specifically to humanists, there is no way any other group will be able to carry out marriages as a result of it. It is uncontroversial and it is just scaremongering by the government to try and link it to Jedis. (pls keep).

‘Hundreds of couples have humanist wedding ceremonies every year and they are legally binding in Scotland, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Norway and parts of the US without any unintended consequences.

They satisfy a very obvious need for a dignified and meaningful ceremony which is not religious.’

There are around 100 humanist ‘celebrants’ operating in Britain who have been trained to carry out weddings. Couples are encouraged to not only to pen their own vows, but the whole service.

Lib Dem MP Stephen Williams has told MPs that humanists carry out more weddings in England and Wales than the Quakers or Unitarians, and the proposals would give them the same legal footing as Jews and Quakers which can marry couples anywhere, not just in a designated building.

He said: ‘The big difference is that they do not have legal force which mean that people who have had a humanist wedding and enjoyed their special day together in front of family and friends subsequently have to attend the registry office and go through another ceremony…or they have no legal protection.’
