The star quarterback of Florida State football team has said 'the only thing as vicious as rape is falsely accusing someone of rape'. 

Jameis Winston, who plays for the Florida State Seminoles, was giving evidence to a Florida Supreme Court hearing in to an alleged sexual assault following a campus party.  

Mr Winston is accused of sexually assaulting a former Florida State University student in his off-campus apartment in December 2012. 

Jameis Winston, who plays for the Florida State Seminoles, gave his evidence to a Florida Supreme Court yesterday amid the glare of the media - he vehemently denied the allegations made against him

In his statement that was read out in court yesterday, Mr Winston vehemently denied the allegations put against him. 

He said: 'I did not rape or sexually assault (name redacted). I did not create a hostile, intimidating or offensive environment in the short period of time that we were together. 

'(Name redacted) had the capacity to consent to having sex with me and she repeatedly did so by her conduct and her verbal expressions. I never used physical violence, threats, or other coercive means towards (name redacted). 

'Finally, I never endangered (name redacted) health, safety, or well-being.'

In his statement read out on the last day of the hearing, Winston said he met the woman on December 6 2012 at Potbelly's, a popular bar for students near the FSU campus.

He said that after dancing for about 10 minutes, he got her telephone number and then contacted her at the end of the night. 

He claimed she voluntarily joined him and his friends in their taxi, which was a five minute ride away. 

Once back at his apartment, Mr Winston said she willingly performed oral sex on him and then engaged in consensual sexual intercourse. 

'Almost immediately upon our arrival, (name redacted) and I went into my bedroom. We were standing facing each other, kissing and touching each other's bodies. I eventually asked (name redacted) if she would perform oral sex on me.

'She said that she would. The lights in my bedroom were on and (name redacted) willingly performed oral sex on me. While (name redacted) was performing oral sex, I was close enough to my dresser to reach over to it, open a drawer, and retrieve a condom.'

Winston added that he and the woman 'also engaged in intense foreplay and heavy petting during the same period that she was performing oral sex. I was with her on the bed during foreplay and I may have ejaculated a small amount of semen onto her clothing.'

The star college quarterback claims that the two were all over each other and that when he grabbed the condom, she helped to put it on - a sure sign he says the sex was consensual.

He said they also had sex a second time in his bathroom as his friends kept pushing open his bedroom door as a 'prank'. 

After they had sex, Mr Winston said he gave the woman a lift back to her dormitory on his scooter. 

Mr Winston, flanked by his lawyer David Cornwell, who said: 'We are confident that Justice Harding, when he hears her multiple lies and Jameis’ truth, will find as every other entity has to this point, that she is lying'

Mr Winston told the court  that he engaged in consensual sexual intercourse with the alleged victim

He told Florida Supreme Court yesterday: 'During our consensual sexual interactions, (name redacted) engaged in sexual talk and took other actions that made it clear that the sex was consensual and that she was enjoying having sex with me. 

'If (name redacted) did not want to have oral sex or intercourse with me, she was fully capable of expressing it to me, the taxicab drivers, the numerous students outside of Potbelly's, my flat mates Chris, and/or Ron. Had she done so, I would have stopped immediately.'

He added: 'Rape is a vicious crime. The only thing as vicious as rape is falsely accusing someone of rape. (Name redacted) and her lawyers have falsely accused me, threatened to sue me, demanded $7,000,000 from me, engaged in a destructive media campaign against me, and manipulated this process to the point that my rights have and will continue to be severely compromised. 

'(Name redacted) and her lawyers' public campaign to vilify me guarantees that her false allegations will follow me for the rest of my life.

'At some point they will be held accountable, so I have determined that it is in my best interests to exercise my right pursuant to Rule 6C2R-3.004 (6)(d)of the Florida State University Student Code of Conduct and answer questions when experienced lawyers and other experts can assist me in confronting (name redacted) false accusation and when (name redacted) is subject to the penalty of perjury and other claims for (name redacted) falsely accusing me of rape.'

He said: 'Rape is a vicious crime. The only thing as vicious as rape is falsely accusing someone of rape'

Over two days and approximately 12 hours, former Florida Supreme Court justice Major Harding heard testimony from witnesses presented by the university, Mr Winston and the woman.

Justice Harding must now decide if Mr Winston is responsible for any of four violations of the code of conduct, including sexual activity without consent and creating a hostile environment.

FSU has up to 10 class days  to give notification of the decision. Seven class days remain until the end of the fall semester on December 12. Spring semester starts on January 7.

John Clune, a Title IX attorney representing the woman, said he expects a decision from Harding within two to three weeks. 

'We want (Winston) to be found responsible and we want him expelled from the school,' Mr Clune said after the hearing yesterday. 

'I think knowing the facts of the case and what has been presented, I think there's a very, very good chance of that happening.'

The lawyer for Mr Winston, sports attorney David Cornwell likened the proceedings to a 'honey trap'. 

He said: 'This process was about making a record to do as I have always said, take this matter to civil court. 

'We will do our best to shut it down with our briefs and have Justice Harding conclude that Jameis didn't do anything wrong. There certainly was no evidence in two days that suggested otherwise.

'I'm not quite sure that given the objectives of (the woman) and her attorneys that there's anyway to remove the taint in this process. It was clear what this was about, absolutely clear what this is about. It is a shakedown.'

FSU has up to 10 class days to give notification of the decision. Seven class days remain until the end of the fall semester on December 12. Spring semester starts on January 7

The hearing is the latest development in a controversial case that polarised public opinion in Tallahassee and prompted claims of favouritism by police towards star athletes. 

Mr Winston, the Heisman Trophy winner who is currently trying to lead the unbeaten FSU Seminoles to back-to-back national titles, was interviewed but never arrested after the woman claimed he assaulted her.

In announcing his decision a year ago not to charge Winston on the grounds of insufficient evidence, state attorney Willie Meggs was critical of detectives who withheld details of the case from prosecutors for 11 months. 

Meanwhile, the alleged victim, who has since left the university, said that during the investigation police advised her 'to think long and hard before proceeding against him' in what was 'a big football town'. She said detectives warned her lawyer to drop the case or have her life 'made miserable and raked over the coals'.

The apparent inaction by the university has also prompted a separate investigation by the US Department of Education into a possible breach of Title IX obligations, which require a school to conduct a prompt hearing into a sexual assault allegation against any of its students.
