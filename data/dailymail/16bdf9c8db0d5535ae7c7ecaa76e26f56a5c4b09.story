BBC spin doctors cooked up a plan to save their boss George Entwistle by dumping blame for the Jimmy Savile fiasco onto the Newsnight editor Peter Rippon, it emerged today.

They decided that sacrificing Mr Rippon - and thereby providing ‘a scalp’ - was the ‘only way to protect’ the former director-general.

The details emerged through text messages which were uncovered by former Sky News chief Nick Pollard who carried out a £2million investigation into the scandal.

It followed the decision by Newsnight to drop an investigation into decades of abuse carried out by Jimmy Savile.

As the crisis engulfed the corporation, 
the Newsnight editor’s fate was being mapped out in mobile phone texts 
between BBC press office chiefs.

One ‘eye-opening’ text message suggesting Mr Rippon should quit was sent on October 20, this year, from Julian Payne, the BBC’s head of press, to the director of communications Paul Mylrea.

The text, which referred to an error-strewn blog written by Mr Rippon to explain why Newsnight had axed its Savile investigation, said: ‘Thought of the hour: PR (Peter Rippon) changes blog and accepts he was wrong and goes, giving Panorama a scalp.

‘GE (George Entwistle) then goes into Select (committee) saying he backed his editor as you would expect.

‘Turns out he was wrong but he did the right thing and we all move on???

Scandal: The BBC discovered damning evidence 
that Jimmy Savile was a paedophile but a Newsnight investigation was 
dropped suddenly

Two days later, after the blog correction had been made, another message was sent from Mr Payne to Mr Mylrea saying: ‘Think am going to need to brief hard today that PR blog was the basis for all our position on this. Only way to protect GE.’

Pollard said that, by this point, Rippon’s now notorious blog had been ‘regarded by some as a means of insulating the Director General from criticism.’

Pollards investigation also showed that the decision to drop Newsnight’s 
report into Jimmy Savile’s decades long campaign of sexual abuse plunged
the BBC into 'chaos and confusion'.

Pollard concluded that management 'proved 
completely incapable of dealing' with the fallout.

'The decision by their editor (Peter Rippon) to drop the original investigation was 
clearly flawed and the way it was taken was wrong, though I believe it 
was done in good faith. It was not done to protect the Savile tribute 
programme or for any other reason,' he said.

Findings: The details about the plan to save George Entwistle emerged through text messages which were uncovered by former Sky News chief Nick Pollard, pictured, who carried out a £2million investigation into the scandal

To come to this conclusion he examined 10,000 emails and documents which shed light on the events.

Sensationally he found George Entwistle was first 
warned of ‘the real truth’ about Savile in May 2010, in an email from 
BBC executive Nick Vaughan-Barratt - but crucially he failed to ask 
further questions about it.

Head of events Mr Vaughan Barratt told Entwistle: 'I understand Jimmy is very ill. We have no obit and I am not sure we would want one. What do you think.

'I
have a personal interest here: my first job was on a JS (Jimmy Savile) 
show — I know him well and saw the complex and sometimes conflicting 
nature of the man at first hand — if you know what I mean! Do you have 
an opinion?'

He later said: 'I’d feel v queasy about an obit. I saw the real truth!!!'

A later email sent on the day after Savile died in October 
2011 also warned Mr Entwistle about the pervert 
entertainer – but the man who ran the corporation for 54 days this year claims he 
never read it.

Commissioning
Editor for Music and Events Jan Younghusband told Mr Entwistle: 'I 
gather we didn’t prepare the obit because of the darker side of the 
story. So something celebrating a particular part of his TV career is 
probably better than the (life) story as there are aspects of this which
are hard to tell.'

Instead Mr Entwistle decided there was no 
need for a quick obituary and BBC1 controller Danny Cohen even suggested a 
special Christmas edition of Jim"ll Fix It.

handling of the Savile case

Speaking about the warnings Mr Pollard 
said today: 'If he had read the email…it would have given Mr Entwistle some 
pause for thought about the planned Christmas tributes.'

Pollard was able to examine texts sent between BBC staff so he could get to the bottom of what happened.

A separate 
investigation has also revealed why Newsnight later ran a second 
controversial report, which wrongly 
linked former Tory party chairman Lord McAlpine to child abuse 
allegations.

It resulted 
largely from a failure by members of the team to follow the BBC’s own 
editorial guidelines, the BBC Trust said today.

The
broadcast on November 2 was a 'grave breach which had been costly to 
all concerned' and resulted in the public being misled, the Trust’s 
Editorial Standards Committee (ESC) found.

It also cost George Entwistle his job.

The then director general has a 
series of disastrous interviews on BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio 5Live and 
admitted he did not see the Newsnight show, had missed all tweets linked 
to it and also the Guardian front page from the day before.

That evening he resigned and received a £450,000 pay-off for doing the 'honourable thing' after just 54 days in the job.
