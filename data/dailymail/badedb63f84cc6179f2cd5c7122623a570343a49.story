If you think adverts on Facebook are annoying, get ready to see them pop up in your Instagram feed too because the company has announced plans to sell advertising by 2014.

Instagram's director of business operations Emily White told the Wall Street Journal the company is looking at ways to make money and intends to introduce adverts 'within the next year.'

Although, she added her team were still looking at ways to integrate the ads into the photo-sharing app without alienating or annoying its users, and without damaging the app's 'cool factor.'

Instagram's director of business has said she intends to introduce adverts to the photo-sharing app within the next year. The adverts could be shown in Instagram's Explore tab, pictured here with a star icon, or appear as sponsored links when people use its search tool

Facebook took a swipe at rival Twitter in June by launching Video on Instagram. 

Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 and Twitter owns the video-sharing app Vine.

Video on Instagram added a Vine-style video icon to the existing Instagram app and users can record 15-second video clips and edit them together for longer videos.

There are also 13 new filters to give the videos the same retro feel as Instagram's pictures.

Twitter’s hugely popular Vine app lets users record and share six-second clips.

White said: 'We want to make money in the long term, but we don't have any short-term pressure.'

It is thought the adverts could appear in Instagram's Explore tab, which shows people what other user's are clicking on and liking.

Alternatively, they could appear when users search for a specific hashtag or picture as sponsored or promoted links.

Further down the line advertisers may also be able to make advert images clickable so users can go directly to the site and buy the product being advertised.

Instagram was bought by Facebook in April 2012 and is said to have been looking at ways of monetising the app ever since. 

Facebook suffered a backlash when it 
introduced adverts to its own site, from users as well as advertisers, 
because the system was too intrusive and complicated. 

It is likely a similar backlash will affect Instagram when the adverts are introduced.

Following Facebook's acquisition, Instagram announced in December 2012 that it would be changing its privacy policy, which could lead to information being shared with advertisers.

Thousands of user's took to social networks including Twitter and Facebook to complain about the changes with many threatening to quit the photo-sharing service.

The news comes as Instagram annnounces it has hit the 150 million active users mark.

When Facebook bought the app, users topped around 20 million and many claimed Facebook could damage the brand.

The app is gaining ground on other sharing apps, including Twitter, that announced it had around 200 million active users in March.
