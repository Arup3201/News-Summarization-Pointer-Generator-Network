It's the one list you hope to never to end up on, but for a California man just getting taking off was an ordeal in itself.

Chau Van, 37, claims he was wrongly put on the Oakland Police Department's "Most Wanted" list for six months in 2012.

He described the experience as 'an egregious and scandalous error'.

Most wanted: Chau Van, 37, was only alerted to the fact he was on Oakland's 'most wanted' list after a friend saw a news report stating he was wanted for his part in a gangland shooting

Mr Van's photo and name were placed on a list of the city's four most wanted suspects by Police Chief Howard Jordan during a news conference about gang violence in February 2012.

A report on the local evening news stated that he was a gang member who was wanted in connection with the shooting and was one of Oakland's most wanted criminals.

He only learned of the error when a friend called him up to tell him about his new unwarranted title.

Mr Van went along to a police station to tell them about the error and to clear his name but instead he was searched, arrested and locked up for three days before he was released

Getting the word out: Police Chief Howard Jordan announced Chau Van's name during a news conference about gang violence in February 2012

Which is it? Initially Mr Van was wanted in connection with a shooting, then police wanted to speak with him over a charge of assault with a deadly weapon

Filed: The claims in the suit include violation of the constitutional right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures, defamation, false arrest and imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligence

A few days later the police 
announced that Mr Van - one of Oakland's most wanted felons -Â  was now 
off the streets and had surrendered because of media pressure.

This time cops announced the fugitive had been wanted for assault with a deadly weapon instead of a shooting.

Mr Van was never charged and he assumed that as a matter of course his name would be removed from the list.

It did not happen until he sent the police department a letter stating his demands six months later.

Mr Van is now suing the city and the 
Chief of Police. His lawsuit states that as 'a law-abiding citizen with 
no history of violence' his reputation was 'irreparably harmed'.

DeWitt
Lacy, Mr Van's lawyer, said in order to restore Mr Van's reputation 
there would bee to be public acknowledgement of the alleged error along 
with the removal of Mr Van's name from the federal and state 'most 
wanted' lists.

The lawsuit also aims to obtain some financial compensation to make up for lost employment and emotional trauma.

Speaking
to KTVU Mr Lacy said :'It put a great amount of fear on him and his 
family. He was wounded and he needs to be made whole.'

Lawsuit: Chau Van, left, and his attorney, DeWitt Lacy, have now filed a lawsuit against the city and state officials. He is also seeking financial compensation

Stopping by: Chau Van went to speak to officers from Oakland Police department to clear his name. He ended up being arrested and locked in a cell for three days

Mr Van said that he has had to move house three times since his photo was made public and he is unable to find a job as a web designer or real estate agent.

Lawyers from the City of Oakland and the police department have not commented on Mr Van's claims.
