Khloe Kardashian hit a patch of black ice, spun off the road and ended up in a ditch while sisters Kim and Kylie Jenner and baby North West were in the car.

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star was behind the wheel of a black Yukon GMC in Bozeman, Montana ,with her siblings and Kim's daughter on Saturday when she swerved into oncoming traffic and ended up in a ditch.

Khloe's sight was partially obstructed after a truck sent snow flying over her windshield during the horrifying incident. They were on the highway that heads towards Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport. 

In the aftermath Kim took to social media to thank God for watching over her family and keeping them safe as they all escaped without injury. Their publicist confirmed they are 'OK'. 

The close call comes two weeks to the day after Bruce Jenner was involved in a fatal car crash in Malibu, California.

Khloe was behind the wheel at the time and her sight was said to be obstructed when a passing truck sent snow flying over her windshield 

TMZ said police arrived at the scene and all four were fine. The car also suffered no damage. 

Police said that there were multiple incidents of cars going off the road because of icy conditions on Saturday in the area.

Montana Highway Patrol Capt. Mark Wilfore says the accident occurred before noon on a highway between Bozeman and Belgrade, where the Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport is located.  

Khloe and Kylie have been skiing in Montana all week, and even tried heli-skiing, sharing photos of their adventure on Instagram.

They were also recently joined by Kim and North on their trip, as well as publicist Jonathan Cheban.

Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick are in Montana too with their family.

Cheban's birthday is today, and after the accident both Kim and Khloe wished him a 'Happy Birthday' on Instagram. 

North West (above with mom Kim) was also in the car at the time of the crash. Police said none of passengers were injured and no damage was done to the car

He also posted a photo eating cake with Khloe on Saturday afternoon. Kylie tweeted on Saturday afternoon; 'Makeup videos coming soon.' 

Bozeman is the fourth-largest city in Montana and home to Montana State University.

This all comes exactly two weeks after Kylie's father and Kim and Khloe's step-dad, Bruce Jenner, was involved in  a fatal car accident. 

Authorities recently said they have not determined who is at fault in that crash, though recently released video seems to show Jenner rear-ending two cars, including the one carrying the woman who was killed.

The driver, Kim Howe, 69, was killed when she was struck head-on by a Hummer as her car drove into the opposite lane. 

The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department is investigating the cause of the wreck and will consider whether to issue a citation that could result in criminal charges - possibly vehicular manslaughter. 

Jenner is not in Montana with the girls, and was seen moving out of his Malibu home on Friday. 

The former Olympian packed up his belongings into a rusty Ford truck and headed for his new home.

The 65-year-old has reportedly  stopped filming a documentary about his transition into a woman following his involvement in the crash.
