Cameron has vowed to wield a second veto in Europe if France and Germany insist on pushing ahead with an EU-wide financial transaction tax

David Cameron has vowed to wield a second veto in Europe if France and Germany insist on pushing ahead with an EU-wide financial transaction tax.

The Prime Minister said countries calling for a levy were welcome to implement it within their own borders – but added that to impose it across the EU without the backing of other major economies would harm businesses and jobs.

The plan to impose a so-called ‘Robin Hood tax’ could cripple the City of London, through which the vast majority of European financial transactions go.

Mr Cameron spoke hours before France announced it would try to implement a financial transaction tax of its own, even if EU leaders cannot agree on a tax to cover the whole union.

The country’s housing minister Benoist Apparu said yesterday that a bill on the tax – which would only cover France – could be put to parliament as soon as next month.

Mr Cameron is entirely happy with the prospect of France going it alone because it would mean their financial sector would be put at a disadvantage to the UK’s.

However, Britain would be able to veto an EU-wide tax because it would need the support of all 27 members.

Mr Cameron said: ‘If the French themselves want to go ahead with a transactions tax in their own country then they should be free to do so.

‘We actually have stamp duty on share transactions in Britain and yet we have one of the most competitive and successful financial services markets anywhere. 

‘But the idea of a new European tax when you are not going to have that tax put in place in other places... I will block it unless the rest of the world all agreed at the same time that we were all going to have some sort of tax.’

The Prime Minister's determination to fall in line with the rest of the world has left him in a trickier position when it comes to IMF contributions, however.

After his pledge not to go above a £10billion ceiling, the Financial Times revealed today that he is prepared to give 30bn euros more to help the eurozone if countries such as Japan and China do the same.

Mr Cameron tried to play down concerns Britain will end up excluded from decisions affecting the single market under a new treaty being thrashed out in Brussels.

The latest draft of a fiscal accord designed to shore up the crisis-hit eurozone specifically talks about ‘deeper integration in the internal market’. It also suggests EU institutions would be involved in policing tough new deficit rules.

A bid to apply new rules across the EU was vetoed by the Prime Minister last month – but Britain found itself alone among the 27 member states in opposing the proposal.

Britain may end up giving billions of pounds more to the International Monetary Fund to help bail out eurozone countries.

After previously refusing to pledge more than the £10bn approved by Parliament in July, David Cameron could be ready to change his position, insiders said.

They believe that if countries such as China and Brazil increase their support to the IMF to help it deal with the eurozone crisis, the Prime Minister is likely to follow suit.

'I'd expect the issue of resources to be discussed at the G20 finance ministers' meeting,' Mr Cameron's spokesman told the Financial Times.

Britain is already under pressure from the single currency countries to  increase its IMF contributions by 30bn euros.

The Prime Minister has so far refused to join the eurozone members who have committed an extra 150bn euros to the IMF to assist Europe.

But it now looks possible that he could commit to giving more money on an ad hoc basis, in a move that is bound to infuriate eurosceptic Tory MPs.

IMF experts have pointed out that getting assistance from other countries will depend on Europe demonstrating its efforts to prop up its struggling countries.

Extra resources would help supplement an IMF war chest of about $348bn, which is currently too small for a major rescue of Spain and Italy.

But Mr Cameron could have trouble persuading Parliament to increase Britain's contributions to the IMF. The last time he tried to do so, 30 Conservative MPs joined forces against the proposal with Labour.
