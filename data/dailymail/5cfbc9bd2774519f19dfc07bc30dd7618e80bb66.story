All eyes are on Merseyside right now - as two English youngsters are being asked to be the talisman for their team.

Ross Barkley is seen as the man to rescue a sub-standard season at Everton and Raheem Sterling is expected to take over from Steven Gerrard as Liverpool's big hope.

Hang on, isn't it a bit unfair to be asking so much of these players?

Raheem Sterling should look to move to Europe and become England's first real superstar

Ross Barkley should head to Manchester United and be nurtured into a top talent

In my view it might be best for both if they leave for pastures new.

They've both shown flashes of brilliance - you have to be in football denial to not recognise how talented these two are. Saying they have the ability to shine at the top level in the future is one thing, making unreasonable demands on them on the pitch prematurely is something very different.

Everton and Liverpool are both giants, and to place so much expectation on their shoulders at this stage of their careers is plain wrong.

Both had their breakthrough seasons in 2013-14, and both have been patchy with their form this campaign - that's to be expected given their inexperience.

Everton have failed this season due to defensive weaknesses and because Romelu Lukaku hasn't delivered value for money so far. But this highlights some major issues with the Everton squad: the defence is ageing, while the players they seem to be relying on to spark up their season are too young for that responsibility - both Lukaku and Barkley are still only 21.

In Barkley's case I suspect that Roberto Martinez will seriously consider trading him in for a fee of £30-£40million in the summer so he can rebuild his squad. Having splurged £28m on Lukaku with limited return so far, I can't see the board making much cash available unless the manager sells first.

That price tag will bring its own pressures but as Wayne Rooney showed 10 years ago, if you're good enough you'll be able to handle it. And let's keep the theme going: Manchester United is exactly the right club for Barkley. The fans tend to back the youngsters there, and under Louis van Gaal his education would be ideal. Sure there are expectations at United, but he'll be surrounded by better players who can take that pressure off him. That isn't happening at Goodison.

Wayne Rooney moved to Man United from Everton and has developed well - Barkley should follow that path

Raheem Sterling seems set to sign a new deal at Liverpool but I can't help thinking he's missing a great opportunity to do something very special. He could be the first young English football superstar to move to a European giant and make his mark.

Liverpool might not make the Champions League next year, and they're already out of it this season. Get that move to Real Madrid or Bayern Munich, do your thing abroad and become one of the greats. See what Gareth Bale has done in a short space of time over there - why wouldn't Sterling want some of that? Do what Steve McManaman did – it is not a crime to leave Liverpool and go elsewhere to win the Champions League.

At Anfield, Sterling saw Luis Suarez leave last year, and he'll lose Steven Gerrard this summer. Suarez wasn't replaced, and it seems Brendan Rodgers is talking up Jordan Henderson as Gerrard's successor. I like Henderson, but Liverpool need big players, stellar names, if they are to get back to where they were.

All the pressure to provide the magic will be on Sterling. Does he need that pressure? He's destined for bigger things than being the great hope at Liverpool, a club that might make it back to the big time every season, or might not.

Sterling should be one of several top players at a club firmly established as one of the most competitive in Europe. He's that good.

I know Liverpool and Everton are giants, but right now those clubs are putting too much pressure on the shoulders of young superstars. They've done great work developing these players, but that is being put at risk with the demands placed on them.

Neither club will make the top four this season, and unless one of them wins the Europa League they won't be playing Champions League football next term.

Sterling and Barkley aren't bigger than the clubs they currently play for - they never will be. But right now they are too good for them. And that's why they need to move away.
