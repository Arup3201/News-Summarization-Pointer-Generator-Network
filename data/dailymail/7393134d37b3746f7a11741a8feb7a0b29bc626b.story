Mary Kidson, 55, who runs a tutoring service for children from her home in Ledbury, has been charged with poisoning a girl

A mother who runs an online tutoring service for children with learning difficulties has been charged with poisoning a young girl.

Mary Kidson, 55, of Ledbury, Herefordshire, is charged with three counts of 'administering poison to a female juvenile with intent to endanger life or inflict grievous bodily harm.'

Kidson, who was initially arrested in March last year, is accused of committing the offences between December 2010 and March 2013 in Ledbury, and a police spokesman said the charges related to a child who is now in her teens.

The spokesman for West Mercia Police 
said: 'The charges follow a lengthy investigation by police at Hereford,
 working with Children’s Services and the local health authority.'

Kidson, a graduate in environmental science was charged on Friday and released on police bail.

She runs her Smart Processing tutoring company from her sprawling £530,000 detached farmhouse, selling home-learning programmes and charging £21 an hour for advice.

Her website claims to offer 
'professional, personalised on-line tutoring' for children as young as 
three who suffer from conditions including autism, dyspraxia and 
auditory processing disorder.

On her company website, Mary describes herself as the parent of a child with verbal dyspraxia - a speech disorder.

She runs the Fast ForWord program, described on her website as a 'series of fun and interactive home e-learning programs' to help students develop English language and reading skills.

She says she became 'fascinated' with
 therapies after her daughter did a Fast ForWord course at the 
suggestion of a specialist from Great Ormond Street Hospital.

Kidson
 studied with a London-based independent speech and language therapist 
before gaining full certification to provide therapy herself in 2008.

She
 then set up her Smart Processing centre at her home in Ledbury, and 
describes herself as fully CRB checked and registered with the Data 
Protection Act (1998) as a Data Controller.

Writing on her website, Kidson says: 
'Having supported and coached my own daughter and seen the significant 
difference the The Listening Program and Fast ForWord software can make,
 I knew that I wanted to share this knowledge with other people and help
 them make a difference.'

Kidson runs her tutoring business, Smart Processing, from her sprawling farmhouse in Ledbury, Herefordshire

Her website bears testimonials from parents whose children Kidson has helped.

One says: 'Mary is so dedicated and always available to discuss any problems.

'As a result, our son is making a huge amount of progress. I would thoroughly recommend Mary Kidson and Smart Processing.'

Kidson will appear at Hereford Magistrates Court on January 29.
