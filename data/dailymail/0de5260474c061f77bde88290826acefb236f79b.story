A 32-year-old Newport Beach lifeguard who drowned while attempting to save a swimmer, has become the first to die in the line of duty in the city's history.

Ben Carlson, described as a veteran lifeguard, died yesterday near the city's pier after trying to rescue a swimmer.

The lifeguard had entered the water from a rescue boat around 5pm and had reached the swimmer when they were both struck by 10-foot high waves, authorities said.

Ben Carlson, 32, became the first Newport Beach lifeguard to die in the line of duty after drowning while going to the rescue of a distressed swimmer at the Orange County beach yesterday

'He just loved being out on the water, he loved the opportunity to help people,' said his father, Chris Carlson

Rescuers took three hours to locate the teenager after he disappeared under a 10-foot high wave and were later seen tearfully consoling one another on Newport Beach

The swimmer made it back to shore, but Ben disappeared.

Rescue officials said the teenager's colleagues were not immediately able to find him due to the turbulent water.

After a three-hour search, which included a helicopter, more than 20 rescuers in the water and a similar amount supporting from the shore, the teenager was located around 8pm.

Ben was pulled on to Newport Pier and taken to Hoag Hospital where he was pronounced dead.Â

Lifeguards tearfully consoled one another following the death.

Beach Fire Department Chief Scott Poster told local media that Ben was 'there to help at every single moment'.

He added: 'It's just an utter tragedy to lose a man of that caliber in the water today.'

Ben's death had hit the close-knit public safety community hard, with officials describing it as a 'very difficult time'.

Californian media reported that Newport lifeguards had made hundreds of rescues in the days before the death, as the Orange County beach had experienced dangerous rip currents.
