A group of yobs hurled a 22kg sandbag into the front window of an express train as it was pulling out from a station.

Police are now hunting the group responsible who could have hurt the driver or dozens of passengers who were travelling in the train.

East Midlands Trains have now posted a £1000 reward for anyone who can help track the culprits down.

Shocking pictures released by British Transport Police show the train's shattered front window after what police said was a 'deliberate act of vandalism'.

 The driver operating the train at the time of the attack was said to be extremely shaken following the ordeal

The 22kg 
sandbag was thrown as the 19.28 St Pancras to Sheffield was travelling 
through Wellingborough Train Station on May 21.

The shocking images show the damage caused to the front window of the train that was travelling at about 65mph.

The
 sandbag, which was thrown from a bridge on the nearby Irthlingborough 
Road at around 20:18, smashed the front windscreen and forced bosses to take the train out of service.

The sandbag was thrown from this bridge after the train had left the station and was travelling south

The train 
was forced to grind to an unscheduled stop, taken out of service and 
passengers required to wait at Kettering Station for the next train.

Luckily, there were no injuries to passengers or the driver, who was said to have been left "extremely shaken" by the incident.

Police said the deliberate act of vandalism could have had 'tragic consequences'

East Midlands Trains are now offering a £1,000 reward to anyone who can help police track down the perpetrators.Inspector Mark Clements, from British 
Transport Police (BTP), said: 'Thankfully, the driver was not injured 
but has understandably been left extremely shaken by the incident.'

Insp Clements said the 'deliberate act of vandalism' could have had 'tragic consequences'.

'This was an incredibly irresponsible and dangerous act and it was lucky no one was injured or killed.

'Officers attended Wellingborough station immediately after the incident was reported to us and immediately searched the area as well as conducting house-to-house enquiries.

'No one was located, but we are determined to find those responsible and bring them to justice.

'I am appealing for anyone who was in the Irthlinborough Road area around the time of the incident and who may have seen anyone acting suspiciously, or running away, to contact BTP as a matter of urgency.

'It is beyond belief that anyone could throw objects at moving trains and we need to trace those responsible before their actions result in serious harm to rail staff or passengers.'

Conservative MP for Loughborough Nicky Morgan, who was onboard at the time, said: 'This was a shocking incident and I am pleased to hear the train driver was not injured.

'All the EMT staff involved responded swiftly and very professionally and we were all lucky the consequences were not more severe.

'I would urge anyone with any information to get in touch with the police now.'
