A single mother from Minnesota who posed for Playboy is suing her former boss after he approved the nude photo shoot and then fired her when it was published.

Jessica Zelinske, who has never been married, said she had asked permission to strip off for the men's magazine.

The 33-year-old appeared on the cover of Playboy's ‘Hot Housewives’ issue last year, having beaten more than 400 amateur models for the coveted cover.

But after the issue came out Zelinske,who has a nine year old daughter, was was fired on the spot as an advertising sales executive at cable communications company Charter Communications in Minnesota.

Her boss, Timothy McBeain, said she'd violated the company's standards of common decency after seeing the cover of Hot Housewives.

The notice went on to say: 'You have violated Charter's professional conduct policy by making the personal choice to pose nude in a well-known publication.'

In her lawsuit, Zelinske claims that she asked her boss for permission to pose for the magazine.

She
maintains they were aware she wanted to pursue the modeling opportunity
after winning an open casting call for housewife models in Chicago.

The model says she was given assurances that the photo shoot would not affect her $18,000 a year job if she posed nude.

The
magazine, featuring Zelinske on the cover, came out in July 2011. 
Zelinske was on the cover of the September 2011 issue of the magazine.

It shows the brunette baring her cleavage with the tag line: 'Naughty moms and sexy wives.'

She also appears on the Playboy's website featuring 'amateur models'.

Zelinske names McBeain along with Connecticut-based Charter Communications and its advertising sales division, Charter Media.

The suit seeks at least $150,000 for, emotional distress, compensatory damages and legal expenses.

Zelinske, who previously posed for Maxim magazine in 2006, said in a 2011 interview that she's always had confidence to pose nude.

'I've always had the confidence to do crazy things like this', she told postbulletin.com.

'Before the shoot, they (Playboy) consult with you about what you like. They want to make sure everything they do is what you want.'

She also said her daughter means the world to her and she's never hidden the fact that she's a mom.

The single mom has also worked at local fashion mall shows in Rochester, Minnesota, promoted mixed martial arts and filmed the finale of Bad Ass for Playboy TV after her photo shoot in 2011

In April 2012, Jessica posed for another glamorous photo shoot with photographer Sherwin Samaniego, to continue her amateur modeling career.
