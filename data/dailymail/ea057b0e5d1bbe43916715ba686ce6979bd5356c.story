These are the pictures of the two children who died in their pushchairs after being crushed by a car that came off the road.

The families of the youngsters said they had been 'overwhelmed and humbled' by the support of well-wishers after the two children were smashed into and flung into the air.

Relatives of one-year-old Oliwier Baczyk and two-year-old Zofia Tabaka said the deaths of the youngsters had left them with an 'utter sense of grief'.

The pair died after they were hit by a car at the junction of Narborough Road and Braunstone Gate, Leicester, on August 6.

Both died on the day of the crash, which happened at about 9.50am, when they were both in pushchairs at the time and the two men with them also sustained injuries.

Police told the opening of the inquest into the two deaths that a dark grey BMW was involved in a collision with a red Mini Cooper at the road junction and the BMW came off the road, mounted the pavement and hit the pushchairs.

Alicza Komar, speaking for the children’s families, said they had taken comfort in the huge display of support from the community in the form of cards and flowers.

She said: 'The heartbreak is indescribable.

'If there is any form of solace we can draw from this situation it is in the support we have received from everyone in the community.

'From those who have approached us to offer their support or condolences to those total strangers who have kept us in their thoughts and prayers, we have been overwhelmed and humbled by the way the people have reacted to our tragic loss.

'Grief has no language barriers, no cultural differences - the pain and loss is universal and in the past week, we have found, so has been the support.

'This has given us great comfort and for that we would like to say thank you.'

A shrine with flowers, cards and candles has been set up at the junction and people both within the Polish community and outside it have been giving money to support the families as they grieve.

Thoutful tributes to the two children were left at the 
scene, comforting the devastated families

The police said yesterday that the bodies of the children were being repatriated to Poland for burial.

Officers continue to investigate the collision and the drivers of both cars, a 40-year-old woman and a 61-year-old man, are on police bail pending further investigation.

Detective Sergeant Mark Watling, of the force’s serious collision investigation unit, said: 'If anyone witnessed the incident or the events leading up to it and has not yet spoken to the police, we would urge them to contact us.'
