Luiz Felipe Scolari has taken the step of bringing in a sports psychologist as he tries to find a way to help Neymar and his team-mates cope with the pressures of a World Cup on home soil.

In the wake of their draining penalty shoot-out victory over Chile, the Brazil manager has recruited Regina Brandao to help the players deal with the overwhelming levels of expectation from the public and media.

Brazil face an in-form Colombia side in the quarter-finals on Friday, and Neymar in particular has expressed his delight at the psychological help the squad is receiving.

'I had never done anything like it before and I am quite enjoying it,' said the forward, who broke down in tears following their dramatic win over Chile.

'It is not only us, in football, who are surrounded by emotion every day and need psychologists.

'I think it could do every person good, to make one more relaxed.

'We have a very good relationship with Regina Brandao. She is a great person. I am learning a lot and I hope to continuing doing it.'

With the likes of Fred and Hulk struggling badly, there is an overwhelming burden upon the 22-year-old to perform - and he has responded in kind scoring four goals so far.

But Neymar insists that he will not crack under the pressure that has been put upon him by the Brazilian fans and media.

'I don't feel overburdened either on the pitch or off it. I have team-mates who help me by winning the ball back, scoring goals, setting them up,' he added.

'The Brazil team doesn't have just one person who has to do everything.'
