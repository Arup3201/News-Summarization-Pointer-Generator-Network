Andrew Mitchell launched an astonishing attack on the Metropolitan Police over the Plebgate affair last night – after a 12-month inquiry concluded there was insufficient evidence that a Number 10 police officer had lied.

The former Tory chief whip named PC Toby Rowland – with whom he clashed in Downing Street – branding him a serial liar and demanding that he repeat his claims that he used the word ‘plebs’ on oath.

Mr Mitchell flatly denies claims by the officer that he used the word after he was stopped cycling through the street’s gates last September.

His denunciation came as prosecutors yesterday decided a single officer should face trial following a mammoth police investigation, which involved taking more than 1,100 statements.

PC Keith Wallis, 53, was charged with misconduct in a public office over allegations he falsely claimed he witnessed the row.

Five officers from the Met’s Diplomatic Protection Group, including Wallis, will now face gross misconduct hearings for discreditable conduct, meaning they could lose their jobs.

Three others will face less serious disciplinary proceedings.

But, crucially, the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to show that PC Rowland, 43, lied about what had happened. Nor is he facing a misconduct inquiry.

Mr Mitchell claimed the police had failed to even interview PC Rowland as a suspect about what happened. And he accused Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe of prematurely clearing his officers of wrongdoing.

Mr Mitchell said: ‘PC Toby Rowland, who was responsible for writing those toxic phrases into his notebook, was not telling the truth.

'I will seek to say this on oath in a court of law and it is our intention to ensure that PC Toby Rowland has similarly to swear his account.

‘I understand that PC Toby Rowland has not been arrested or even interviewed under criminal caution during the police inquiry.’

In a statement, PC Rowland said last night: ‘I stand by my account of events in Downing Street on 19th September 2012.

'This has now been thoroughly investigated and the CPS has confirmed there is insufficient evidence to take any criminal proceedings against me. ‘In addition, neither am I subject to any disciplinary proceedings.

'I confirm that I am prepared to give evidence under oath if required.’

Mr Mitchell is suing The Sun newspaper, which printed the original report, for libel and said he believed the paper would have to call PC Rowland to corroborate the paper’s account, forcing him to give evidence on oath.

Scotland Yard said PC Rowland was interviewed under ‘police misconduct regulations’ – not under police caution. But it added his statement could have been used against him had he been charged with criminal or internal disciplinary offences.

The announcement by new Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders fell far short of the result that Mr Mitchell had sought if he is to resume his cabinet career.

She said: ‘We have considered all of the evidence in this case, including previously unseen, unedited CCTV footage from Downing Street, not referred to by the media.

'Taking it all into account, including the accounts of the officer at the gate of Downing Street and that of Andrew Mitchell MP before, during and after the incident, we have found that there is insufficient evidence to show that the officer at the gate lied in his account.

‘The CPS has also found that there is insufficient evidence to show that Mr Mitchell was the victim of a conspiracy of misinformation.’

Her lawyers also found that a jury would be likely to decide that the leaking of an email in the affair was in the public interest, a finding that could undermine Mr Mitchell’s attempt to sue the Sun.

Sir Bernard said: ‘This investigation has been a ruthless search for the truth as at the heart of this are extremely damaging allegations that officers have lied and falsified statements against a Cabinet Minister.’

A Channel 4 documentary into the Plebgate affair has been called into question by the new head of the Crown Prosecution Service.

Last December’s programme – hailed by Andrew Mitchell and his supporters – appeared to cast doubt on the officers’ account of what happened.

It revealed CCTV footage which showed there was not a large group of tourists outside the main gate of Downing Street at the time of the altercation as had originally been claimed.

But Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders, who succeeded Keir Starmer QC earlier this month, said the programme ‘showed edited footage that was less than clear in a number of regards’.

She said in her 1,800-word statement on Plebgate: ‘Much of the press reporting to date has assumed that the CCTV recordings show that the gate officer lied about the words used during the incident.

‘The CCTV footage that has been aired publicly was edited and did not show the full picture.

‘We have been supplied with previously unseen and unedited footage of the incident from five different cameras. The CCTV footage does not determine the issue completely as it could be consistent with either the accounts of the officer on the gate or Mr Mitchell.

‘It is clear from the footage that there was sufficient time for the words to have been said either as described by the gate officer or as described by Mr Mitchell, and this has been confirmed by an expert.’

A Channel 4 spokesman defended its journalism on Plebgate.

He said: ‘The CCTV footage was obtained by Andrew Mitchell from Downing Street and provided to Dispatches and Channel  4 News.

The footage as broadcast for the first time on 18th December 2012 was not edited by the production team to change or alter the sequence of events.

‘Furthermore the three camera angles that we were provided with were image-matched frame by frame to confirm their veracity. We stand fully behind this investigation.’

At his televised press conference yesterday, Mr Mitchell made clear his appreciation of the Channel 4 documentary, and selected Michael Crick, Channel 4 News’s political correspondent – with whom he enjoys a strong professional relationship – to ask him the first question from the floor.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
