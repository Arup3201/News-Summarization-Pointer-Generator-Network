Staunch: Barack Obama has shown no inclination he wants to significantly tighten gun control laws in the wake of the weekend shootings

It is considered a basic right by many Americans and Barack Obama has shown no inclination to significantly tighten gun control laws in the wake of the weekend shootings at a cinema.

The president reiterated the stance outlined in a piece published in an Arizona newspaper in March last year when he emphasised the need to protect citizens’ right to bear arms.

White House press secretary Jay Carney, was quoted on abc News today saying that Obama’s views have not altered since 12 people died in shootings at the Dark Knight Rises Batman premiere in Aurora, Colorado.

Mr Carney said: ‘He [the president] believes we need to take steps that protect Second Amendment rights of the American people but that ensure that we are not allowing weapons into the hands of individuals who should not, by existing law, obtain those weapons.'

The announcement is in keeping with the position the president has taken throughout his tenure, namely to avoid a conflict with the powerful National Rifle Association.

Should gun owners face tougher restrictions in wake of Aurora shooting?

In the op-ed article published in the Arizona Star in March 2011, two months after the shootings in Tucson, Arizona, in which six people were killed and 13 — including now former Republican Gabrielle Giffords — were wounded, the president called for a focus on 'sound and effective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible, law-breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place.'

Measures identified included a drive to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System by using incentives to encourage states to 'provide the best data — and therefore do the most to protect our citizens.’

The aim, said Mr Obama, was to make the system faster and more agile to create a structure that was ‘instant, accurate, comprehensive and consistent for background checks’ to those selling guns who want to do the right thing and to ensure that criminals can’t evade it.

Such checks would not have prevented the alleged Aurora shooter, because James Holmes had no criminal record, bar a speeding ticket, and the indications are that he purchased the guns he used legally.

Mr Carney added: 'The president’s view is that we can take steps to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them under existing law, and that’s his focus right now.'

The spokesman also said there was no thought of pushing to renew a ban on assault weapons which expired in 2004 but which might have covered one of the weapons used by the shooter as well as a large capacity ammunition feeding device.

Both Democratic officeholders and voters in important battleground states are against gun control and on CNN this morning Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper defended the second amendment right.

He said: 'If it wasn’t one weapon, it would have been another. I mean, he was diabolical. If you look at what he had in his apartment and what his intentions were… If there were no assault weapons available, and no this or no that, this guy is going to find something, right? He’s going to know how to create a bomb.'
