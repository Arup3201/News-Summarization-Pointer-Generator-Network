Francesco Totti has joined in poking fun at new Roma team-mate Ashley Cole by doing his own version of the 'lurking' images photos that have gone viral.

Totti can be seen standing alone awkwardly as him and the rest of the Roma squad pose for a picture on the Rocky Steps in Philadelphia during their USA pre-season tour.

The Roma icon has joined in the fun after Cole was caught on camera left on the periphery in a squad photo taken last month.

Cole, who signed for AS Roma on a free transfer from Chelsea in July, has taken the virals well - humouring some with replies via his Twitter account.

Here are the best efforts from the internet wizzes who have pounced on Cole’s unfortunate team photo.
