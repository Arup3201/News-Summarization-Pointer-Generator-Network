The grandson of a Bible studies teacher brutally murdered in a 1985 robbery said he wants to take her killer 'for a meal and (to) do some shopping' now she has been released from prison.

Bill Pelke, who was just 15 when his 78-year-old grandmother Ruth Pelke was stabbed 33 times in her home, said he wanted to help Paula Cooper start her new life outside prison as part of a 'journey' of compassion and forgiveness.

Cooper, now 43, sent him an email before her release and he said he expects a call from the woman in the coming days.

'I'm hoping we'll get together for a meal and do some shopping. I have a friend who wants to buy her a couple of outfits,' Pelke told ABCNews.com.

'It's been a long journey, that's for sure, but what I learned about love and compassion and forgiveness in 1986 has just kept me going.'

On Monday afternoon, Paula Cooper walked out of the Rockville Correctional Facility in central Indiana a free woman after 28 years behind bars.

The Indiana Department of Correction gave Cooper a change of donated clothes and $75. Prisons spokesman Doug Garrison said the Department of Correction has also organized a place for her to live after her release, however, he would not disclose where. Her parole officer would help her find a job and permanent housing, Garrison added.

Cooper's sister, Rhonda Labroi, said the 43-year-old had worked hard to change her life in the decades since the crime and that her family was proud of her.

'She entered prison as a very troubled teenager and is leaving a reformed woman,' Labroi told ABCNews.com in an email.

'We are proud of how much she's grown
and she has all of our support as she starts this second chance at 
life. As always, our sincerest thoughts and prayers go out to the Pelke 
family.'

Cooper was just 15 in May 1985 when 
she and two other teenage girls entered Ruth Pelke's home in
Gary, Indiana, by telling her they wanted to study the scripture. Once 
inside, they viciously attacked the frail woman.

Cooper, was released because the Indiana Supreme Court commuted her sentence to 60 years in prison in 1988. In prison, she received a bachelor's 
degree a went on to train companion dogs for the disabled and serve as a
counselor to other inmates.

Her prison record shows 23 violations, though only minors infractions since 1995 when she was sentenced to solitary confinement for assaulting a guard.

She told the Indianapolis Star in a 2004 interview that she feels remorse for the killing. 

'Everybody has a responsibility to do 
right or wrong, and if you do wrong, you should be punished,' she said. 
'Rehabilitation comes from you. If you're not ready to be rehabilitated,
you won't be.'

Bill Pelke 
said he has befriended Cooper in the nearly three decades she has 
been in prison and forgives her for her crime.

'My main concern is seeing her get settled and find a job,' he told the Star.

The crime horrified Indiana. Cooper admitted to the murder, but prosecutors pushed for the death penalty, arguing the crime was unspeakably vicious and pre-planned.

Investigators found she stabbed Pelke 33 times with a 
kitchen knife as the elderly woman lay on the floor. One of the thrusts 
was so hard, it passed through Pelke's body and damaged the wood 
floorboards.

In 1986, at age 16, she was sentenced 
to die by Lake County Judge James Kimbrough. At the time, state law 
allowed for the execution of anyone age 10 and over who was convicted of
capital murder. 

She was the youngest person on death row in the country.

The
sentence sparked and uproar from anti-death penalty campaigners around 
the world. Letters flooded the state General Assembly, the prosecutor's 
office and the Indiana Supreme Court.

Pope John Paul II himself pleaded for clemency for Cooper and sent an emissary to visit the prosecutors and beg not to condemn the girl.

Cooper spent less than two years on death row, by 1988 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled minors couldn't be executed for any crime that happened before age 16. In 2005, a new court ruling raised the age to 18.

The Indiana Supreme Court commuted her sentence to 60 years in prison that year. By 2002, the state raised the minimum age for execution to 18.

Cooper is being released after 28 years, thanks to an Indiana law that allows a day's credit for 
every day served and other credits for educational achievements and good
behavior.
