Guests at this hotel really are living in their own bubble as hotel rooms are contained in huge plastic globes.

French designers have created the otherworldly spheres deep in the heart of woodland just ten miles north of Marseille.

The Attrap'Rjves family hotel, in the Allauch commune, gives adventurous travellers the chance to spend a night under the stars without resorting to tents.

From £100 a night, outdoor lovers can enjoy a stay in a two-person bubble room, made from transparent plastic, and soak up stunning scenery, natural beauty and astronomy.

Each room comes with a complimentary telescope for budding stargazers to enjoy the night sky - they even have a chart to log their findings.

Visitors can choose from five rooms - Suite Chic, 1001 Nights, Zen, Glamour and Nature - but willing staff will also cater to specialist requests.

Since opening in 2010, the isolated retreat has become the dream destination for holidaymakers looking for a private getaway.
