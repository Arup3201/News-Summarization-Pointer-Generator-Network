Missing: Terry Dewayne Smith Jr went missing Saturday night while his step-brother was babysitting and his body was found on Wednesday

A psychic has revealed that she was the one to help police discover the body of the autistic 11-year-old boy in a shallow grave near his home after he had been missing for three days.

The woman's vision reportedly led her to the area about 100 feet from Terry Dewayne Smith Jr.'s mother's home in Menifee, California where they found the boy's body buried.

Riverside County Sheriff's Detective John Powers confirmed to a local radio station that Ms Ragland did play a pivotal role in helping them find the boy's body.

Mr Powers says Ragland called a tip line about her vision, and was invited to join the search.

He says Ragland and her children came to the house without knowing it was the boy's, walked on to the property and right to the partially buried body.

Mr Powers says he searched the area previously himself without seeing it.

This revelation comes the same day that the boy's father, who lives in West Virginia, said that Terry was not autistic and that he had spoken to him before he disappeared when the boy asked him if he could go visit.

The 11-year-old had lived with his father, Terry Smith Sr., in West Virginia up until 2001 when he went to live with his mother Shawna in California. Shawna now lives in Menifee with her longterm lesbian partner, Denise, and her son from a different relationship.

That 16-year-old boy, Terry's 
half-brother, has been charged with the murder and now a hearing will be
held to see if he will be tried as an adult or a child.

Vision: Pam Ragland was volunteering during the search for the missing boy and had a 'knowing' of where she should go to look for the body

Near home: The boys lived with their mother and her partner in the home center right, and Terry's body was found in a shallow grave by the tree back to the left, only 100 feet away

Police have not released any official 
motive for the alleged murder, but psychic Pam Ragland said that she had
a bad feeling about the half-brother.

Ms Ragland, who lives in Los Angeles, was driving around Menifee with her 
children in the car as they helped look for the missing boy.

She told NBC Los Angeles that she had a very specific dream about the boy's whereabouts.

'I
had this knowing that he was in a certain direction and whichever way I
would turn I would know which direction to go,' she said.

Arrested: Terry's half-brother, seen here, has not been publicly identified but was taken in by police on Wednesday on suspicion of Terry's murder. He was formally charged with the crime on Friday

'That's
the building I saw in my vision, and it was very distinctive and it was
like this- it's giving me chills to even think about it now- it was 
like this open tack shed.'

They
went towards a fenced-in area near a tree behind the family's home and 
she 'something that smelled dead'. Minutes later they spotted the top of
Terry's head poking out of the shallow grave.

Police
are still investigating the case and determining the charges that they 
will press against the teenage half-brother, but for now the family is 
asking for privacy.

'Everybody
has known Terry, if they're lucky, for five minutes; we've known him 
for 11 years and we have 11 years of grieving to do,' Shawna's partner 
Denise said.

Reeling: Denise (pictured), Terry's mother's longterm lesbian partner, said that the family is grieving

Heartbroken: The boy's father, Terry Smith Sr (pictured), is a retired truck driver who lives in West Virginia and he said that- in spite of Shawna's claims- he did not believe his son was autistic

Shawna initially described Terry Jr. as an autistic boy who took special medication and answered only to his nickname, 'JuJu.'

His father, however, insisted that his son was not autistic, saying he was a normal kid who loved video games and baseball, he said.

'He was a very bright, well-adjusted child, at least he was when he left here,' said Smith Sr., a 62-year-old retired truck driver.

'He pushed buttons and would aggravate you. But, other than that, it was just the typical way... of a typical boy trying to get his way.'

Tragic: The psychic said that she knew she was close when she smelled 'something dead'

In danger: Terry, who weighs 76 pounds and is 4'8", most likely did not take his medicine with him which will cause problems because he is a high-functioning autistic

Smith Sr. also helped raise the half brother accused in the case, even though he was not his biological father, he said.

The teen, whose name has been publicly released, moved from West Virginia to California after his mother abruptly pulled him out of school, he said.

'I taught him how to walk. I helped him when he was on the baseball team here,' he said, recalling that he called the half brother 'little Spider-Man.'

Investigators told Smith Sr. that Terry Jr. died after a hit to the head but declined to say more, saying he didn't want to jeopardize the investigation.

'I think him and (the half brother) got into it and it went too far,' said Smith Sr.
