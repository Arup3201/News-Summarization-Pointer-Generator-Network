TV watchdog Ofcom has been bombarded with a fresh flood of complaints about Celebrity Big Brother contestant Perez Hilton's latest brush with Katie Hopkins.

The controversial US blogger has formed a strange rivalry with the outspoken newspaper columnist in the reality TV show's opening weeks.

But their odd relationship appeared to boil over when Hilton was returned to the house earlier this week. 

Hilton, 36, was shown leaning towards Hopkins and sticking his tongue out in an apparent attempt to lick her face.

Lewd: Perez Hilton reportedly demanded that Katie Hopkins perform a sex act on him after trying to lick her face as he made a shock return to the Celebrity Big Brother house on Wednesday

Ofcom had already received 71 complaints about the incident.

The calls and emails came on top of more than 700 complaints about Hilton's 'sexual' behaviour in the house's garden last Friday and more than 2000 complaints about the show's latest series as a whole.

An Ofcom spokesman: 'Ofcom has received 2,005 complaints about Celebrity Big Brother to date. We are assessing these complaints, before deciding whether to investigate.' 

It has been reported that the attempted face-licking was not gossip blogger Hilton's only inappriopriate behaviour towards Hopkins, 39, on Wednesday. 

In actions not screened on air, Hilton is also said to have been seen 'frantically thrusting his hips' towards his housemate.

He also reportedly told her to 'lick it good, suck this d*** just like you should' - a take on Khia's sexually-charged 2002 rap hit My Neck, My Back.

It was claimed today that the off-screen exchange could now lead to Hilton being questioned by police when he eventually leaves the house.

A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'We have received no complaints either from audiences or anyone in the house. Obviously if any incidents are reported we would fully investigate these.' 

One is not amused: Katie was far from impressed with the attention she received from her arch nemesis

It wouldn't be the first time police have had to investigate incidents on the show.

Fellow contestant Jeremy Jackson, 34, was kicked off the programme earlier this month after he lunged at Chloe Goodman while she was wearing only a bathrobe. He was later handed a formal caution by Hertfordshire Police.

Hopkins did not mention the incident in her column in The Sun this morning, suggesting she is unlikely to go to police.

She did however call Hilton 'walking anthrax' and claimed he had been brought back into the fold to give her 'someone to spar with'.

Hilton has been dubbed the 'most hated man in Britain' for his behaviour on the show, in which he often appears dressed only in his underwear.

He has been cited as the reason singer Alexander O'Neal walked out of the house, after the singer claimed Hilton's 'taunts' had put him under 'unbearable stress'.

Columnist Katie Hopkins has been most vocal in her dislike of the American, branding him 'vile' and 'disgusting' to his face. 

Channel 5 were unavailable for comment on the alleged off-screen incident.
