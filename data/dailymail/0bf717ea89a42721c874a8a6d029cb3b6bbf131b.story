It is an unusual way to celebrate a 50th anniversary.

But a down-on-its-luck Nasa is reluctantly searching for tenants to rent disused facilities at its Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The cash-strapped U.S. space agency is unable to maintain much of its base at Cape Canaveral so, rather than let it slide into ruin, has decided to let out some of its famous hangars.

How it might look: A down-on-its-luck Nasa is searching for tenants to rent disused facilities, including the Vehicle Assembly Building (pictured), at its Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida

Among the facilities available to rent
are a space shuttle launchpad; two giant mobile platform launchers; two
space shuttle maintenance hangars; a huge caterpillar crawler used to 
move rockets; a 52-storey Vehicle Assembly Building with four rocket 
assembly bays; and a 15,000ft-concrete runway.

The decision to allow private companies to rent out the  Kennedy Space Center was not made lightly.

Robert
Cabana, director of the Kennedy Space Center, told the Washington Post:
'I have a lot of facilities that we, Nasa, no longer need.

'I don’t have the money to maintain them, I don’t have the money to tear them down. They’re just going to sit and rot.'

The
downturn in Nasa's fortunes comes a half century after the space centre
opened in 1962, the same year that John Glenn orbited Earth.

Space shuttle Atlantis rolls to the launchpad atop a giant crawler from the Vehicle Assembly Building floor last May. The crawler is one of the unique facilities available to rent

Among the facilities available to rent are:

Renting out its facilities is symbolic of the changing times in space exploration.

Kennedy Space Center once had 18,000 Nasa employees, while it now has only 7,500.

Last year, Nasa's shuttle program, 
which operated out of Cape Canaveral, was closed due to high operating 
costs and for funds to be freed-up to develop new spacecraft that can 
travel beyond the International Space Station's 220mile-high orbit.

Russian and European freighters will keep the space station stocked with food, water and supplies in the immediate future.

In 2010, President Barack Obama pledged the U.S. would send the first man to Mars.

But earlier this month, Nasa 
announced it is to cut its exploration to the Red Planet. It is part of 
the space agency's plan to reduce its exploration of other planets.

Touchdown: Atlantis lands on the Kennedy Space Center runway last July. The 15,000ft-long runway is one of the facilities that Nasa is seeking to let

But the agency's former science chief is calling the plan 'irrational'.

With limited money for science and an
over-budget new space telescope, Nasa essentially had to make a choice 
in where it wanted to explore - the neighbouring planet or the far-off 
cosmos. Mars lost.

Edward Weiler, who until September 
2011 was Nasa's associate administrator for science, said: 'To me, it's 
totally irrational and unjustified.

'We are the only country on this 
planet that has the demonstrated ability to land on another planet, 
namely Mars. It is a national prestige issue.'
