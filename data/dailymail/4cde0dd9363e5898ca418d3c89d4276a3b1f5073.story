A new victory dance has taken over March Madness after a little-known school in Georgia beat out odds-favorite Duke.

The Mercer Bears beat the Duke Blue Devils on Friday and player Kevin Canevari won the hearts of a new legion of fans when he was spotted doing the NaeNae dance in response to their victory.

Canevari was surrounded by his teammates and coaches when he started showing his moves.

Not only did the dance win over friends from around the country, but also showed his homegrown roots as the dance was originally popularized by Atlanta-based rap group We Are Toonz.

'We were confident all week,' said Canevari, who was one of the teams seven seniors.

'We don't really look at it like we're an underdog in this tournament. Obviously, everyone's a great team, there's already been so many upsets.'

Mercer is a 8,300-student school from Macon, Georgia.

The school delivered the biggest shocker in an already topsy-turvy NCAA tournament on Friday, going into Duke's backyard and knocking off the Number 3 seed Blue Devils 78-71.

'This, is what March Madness is all about,' Atlantic Sun player of the year Langston Hall said.

The 14th-seeded Bears - with a starting lineup of five seniors - came back from five points down in the last 4:52 as Duke's offense collapsed.

They sent home one of the true blue-blood programs, coached by Hall of Famer Mike Krzyzewski and starring freshman Jabari Parker, sure to be one of the top NBA picks this year.

Mercer is coached by former Oklahoma Baptist player Bob Hoffman, who has banged around the coaching ranks from women's teams to the American Basketball Association to the Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the NBA Developmental League.
