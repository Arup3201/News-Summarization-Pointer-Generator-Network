'Wasting NHS money': Sarah-Jane Marsh, partner of Sir David since 2002, is chief executive at Birmingham Children's Hospital

The wife of embattled NHS boss Sir David Nicholson has been accused of overpaying staff at the children’s hospital she runs by more than £1 million.

Sarah-Jane Marsh is chief executive at Birmingham Children’s Hospital where 634 overpayments totalling £1.3 million were handed out between November 2010 and November 2013.

The hospital has still to claim back £800,000 – meaning it is currently owed more money by staff than any other trust in England.

Last night Tory MP Charlotte Leslie called Ms Marsh’s competency into question, saying she was ‘very concerned’ at the chief executive’s ability to run the hospital.

Ms Leslie, a member of the House of Commons Health Select Committee, also raised the question about how Ms Marsh came to be appointed nearly five years ago at the age of 32, making her one of the youngest hospital bosses in the country.

She said: ‘There are big questions over her competence and how she got that job in the first place.

‘She is wasting hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money because she can’t run a tight ship. I am very concerned.’

She added: ‘It is tremendously concerning that this money has not gone towards the care of children.’

Ms Marsh, who announced she was to marry Sir David at the end of 2009, first met him in 2002 when, as an NHS graduate trainee, she was sent to work as his assistant for six months.

At the time he was director of health and social care for the Midlands and East of England. The following year he gave her a reference when she applied for the post of head of planning and development at Walsall Hospitals NHS Trust. She got the job.

He also gave her a reference when she applied to be chief operating officer at Birmingham Children’s Hospital in 2007, which she secured.

In March 2009 she was made interim chief executive, and a couple of months later she was confirmed in  the £155,000-a-year post.

This was despite having been in charge of day-to-day operations when the hospital was criticised by the Healthcare Commission for a lack of beds and poor training and care.

That October Mr Nicholson and Ms Marsh announced their marriage plans. Sir David has always maintained he provided references only as a former employer and has stressed they were not in a relationship when he gave them.

Her reference: Sir David announced he would be stepping down as chief executive of NHS England last May in the wake of the Stafford Hospital care scandal

The extent of overpayment has come to light thanks to a Freedom of Information request to all of England’s 159 NHS hospital trusts.

According to responses from 112 of them, they paid out £50 million too much in 36,773 overpayments during the three-year period. They are still owed £11 million.

Conservative MP Andrew Percy, another health committee member, said: ‘While the sums may look small in comparison to the NHS budget, they equate to very many nurses.’

Asked about Ms Marsh’s competence, Birmingham Children’s Hospital chairman Keith Lester said yesterday: ‘Sarah-Jane Marsh is a compassionate and committed leader who puts children, young people, and families first. Her track record over the past five years speaks for itself.’

Last month the £235 million-a-year hospital was given an excellent report by the Care Quality Commission.

NHS trusts said human error or  miscalculation of overtime was most often to blame for overpayments, and staff often paid back the money through payroll.

Last May Sir David announced he would be stepping down as chief executive of NHS England. The decision came after intense criticism from campaigners and MPs, following publication of the Francis report into the Stafford Hospital care scandal, in which up to 1,200 patients died.

lSir David has appeared to mock Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt in a tweet to a spoof account that lampoons the Minister. ‘Hello Jeremy any instructions for the weekend,’ he wrote to @Jeremy_Twunt, whose 3,566 followers include NHS workers who don’t like Mr Hunt. The Minister has taken to ringing hospital chiefs personally  if they miss their targets.
