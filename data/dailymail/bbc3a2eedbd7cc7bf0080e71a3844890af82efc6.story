Hatem Ben Arfa will NOT be returning to Newcastle United when Hull City terminate his loan deal next month.

Newcastle manager Alan Pardew does not want Ben Arfa disrupting the team spirit he has harnessed at St James’ Park and the 27-year-old now faces an uncertain future.

His Newcastle contract is up at the end of the season and, unless he can find a new loan club in January, he faces the prospect of training alone for the remainder of the campaign.

When asked about Ben Arfa’s situation on Tuesday, Pardew said: ‘He won't be coming back here, that's all I can say.’

Hull boss Steve Bruce took a gamble when he signed Ben Arfa on a season-long loan on deadline day.

But the France midfielder was substituted after just 35 minutes of their 3-0 defeat at Manchester United on November 29 and hasn’t been seen since.
