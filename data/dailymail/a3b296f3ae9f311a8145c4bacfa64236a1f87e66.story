He isn't exactly famous for sitting still - so when unsuspecting fans approached a wax figure of Jeremy Lin for a photo, they didn't suspect a thing.

But they were given a fright - which soon turned to joy - when the still figure jumped up to surprise them, revealing himself as the LA Lakes star player.

Lin, 26, a point guard with the NBA team, held his pose while guests at the San Francisco branch of Madame Tussauds wax museum came filing by.

But when the moment was right, Lin leaped up, made a noise, or met the gaze of the fans stood right next to him, some of whom jumped out of their skins.

At one point, Lin pulled off a combo with the actual waxwork, which is suspended next to a basket in a slam dunk pose, by running in from the side and scoring two points himself.

Fans who were appreciating the fake Lin - and got a sudden upgrade - spoke of their shock and delight to see the real deal.

One said: 'I just got dunked on by Jeremy Lin. I showed up, took a picture with his wax figure, and here he comes out behind the curtain!'

However, one visitor who wasn't take in was the star's own mom.

Shirley Lin was also seen approaching her 'waxwork' son, but escaped being fooled and gave Lin and affectionate squeeze on the shoulder, breaking the illusion.

The stunt was pulled last month, but only came to light a few days ago when Madame Tussads uploaded footage of the incident to its YouTube channel.
