A record number of people are now in work after a massive hiring surge, official figures revealed this morning.

The number of people with a job increased by 143,000 to reach 30.94 million in the three months to January – with wages now rising six times faster than inflation.

At the same time unemployment fell by 102,000 to reach 1.86 million while the number of people on the dole last month fell by 31,000 to 791,200, the Office for National Statistics said.

However, today’s figures also revealed that almost as many foreigners found work over the past year as British citizens.

The number of Britons working in the UK increased by 375,000 to reach 28million – while the number of foreign workers jumped by an astonishing 239,000 to reach 2.96 million.

There will also be concern at the increase of women forced to work part time. While the number of men in part-time jobs fell by 20,000, the number of women in part-time work soared by 157,000.

It means there are now 6.15million women in jobs that aren’t full time – almost three times higher than the number of men in part-time work.

A record number of number are now in work after a massive hiring surge, the Office for National Statistics said this morning

Overall, unemployment is now at a near seven-year low, while the number of people are in work has hit a new record. The employment rate of 73.3% has never been higher.

The jobless total is now 1.86 million, the lowest since the summer of 2008 and almost half a million down on a year ago. Overall, 5.7 per cent of over 16s are unemployed - compared to a European Union average of 9.8 per cent.

The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance fell by 31,000 to 791,200 in February - the 28th consecutive monthly reduction.

The number of people classed as economically inactive, including those on long-term sick leave, looking after a relative or who have given up looking for work, fell by 30,000 to just over nine million, or 22.2 per cent of 16 to 64-year-olds. However, this is 14,000 higher than a year ago.

Self-employment increased by 33,000 to 4.5 million, close to a record high and accounting for more than one in four jobs.

Other figures showed that public sector employment has fallen by 6,000 to just under 5.4 million, the lowest since current records began in 1999.

George Osborne, pictured outside Number 11 Downing Street this morning, has promised to deliver 'a budget that works for you'

The biggest losses have been in local government, while employment in the NHS increased by 18,000 over the past year.

Prime Minister David Cameron this morning hailed the figures. He said: 'The highest employment rate in our history is not a dry fact. It means more people with the security of a pay packet and a brighter future.'

Chancellor George Osborne added: 'Today's ONS figures record yet another economic milestone, confirming a new record high employment rate alongside a claimant count that has not been lower since 1975.

'This good news is further proof that the government's long term economic plan is working and that British families are seeing the results with regular wages rising more than five times faster than prices.

'But in an uncertain world economy all of this progress will be at risk of collapsing back into chaos unless we carry on working through the plan that is delivering stability and rising living standards.'

His Lib Dem number two Danny Alexander said: 'Today's ONS figures show a yearly increase of 617,000 more people in work with a record high employment rate and unemployment continuing to fall each year.

'For the fifth month in a row wages are also continuing to rise faster than prices.

'While there is a lot more to do to fully repair our economy, this strong job creation is powerful evidence that we are creating the right economic conditions for businesses to invest and grow.'

Unemployment has fallen in almost every region in the UK - with only Scotland and the East of England seeing an increase in the number of people out of work

The Business Secretary Vince Cable claimed the employment figures were 'an historic moment'.

He added: 'With almost three quarters of working age people now in work, we have achieved the highest rate of employment in the UK since records began.

'This is a sign that the long term decisions the Liberal Democrats have taken in government have created a more resilient economy.'

But Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the 'remarkable set of figures' were partly down to his benefit reforms.

He said: 'For every single day that this Government has been in power, we have seen an average of 1,000 more people in work. In total, that's 1.9 million more people with the self-esteem and financial security that a job brings.

'Thanks to our long-term economic plan, Britain is looking forward to a brighter, better, and more secure future. And thanks to our welfare reforms we have ensured everyone has the skills and the support, as well as the opportunities, to be part of the economic recovery.'
