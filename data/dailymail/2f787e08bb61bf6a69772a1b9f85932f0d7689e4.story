Barbara Aqueveque (pictured) has been accused of a label-switching scam which saw her buy expensive children's toys for a fraction of the price and then selling them for huge profits on eBay

A mother has been accused of making up to $30,000 a month in a label-switching scam which enabled her to buy hundreds of children's toys at a fraction of the price.

Barbara Aqueveque allegedly swapped the UPC bar codes of expensive products for cheaper ones so the wrong price would register at the check-out.

She then sold her ill-gotten gains on eBay for huge profits.

Police in Lauderhill, Florida, believe the 34-year-old pulled off the con for up to 18 months, hitting three to four Target or Walmart stores a day.

She would invest about $80 each day to buy the items, but would make around $1,000 selling them online.

Lauderhill
Police Detective Alex Iwaskewycz said: 'She had a store on eBay and 
then the funds would be transferred through PayPal and then directly 
into her checking account.

'She used the same debit card in every transaction she completed in all the Targets, and as you can see, every item is $6.99.'

Iwaskewycz told 7News there were some months when she had $30,000 entering her account.

Aqueveque
was allegedly caught on surveillance camera placing a bar code over the
original label of an item in the Target store at the Sawgrass Mills 
Mall in April.

'Caught in the act': Police say this surveillance footage shows Aqueveque switching the bar code on an expensive toy for one with a far cheaper price

Prolific: It is alleged that Aqueveque had been running the scam for up to 18 months, targeting three or four stores every day

Duped: When Aqueveque gets to the checkout, the scanner registers the wrong bar code and she is able to walk off with the toy for a fraction of the cost

She was then seen buying the item at the checkout, where the scanner registers the wrong bar code and she is able to walk off with the toy for the reduced price.

In one instance, her son tries to buy something he wanted, but she refuses as it did not have an altered label.

Some
of the toys included original Lego kits, Star Wars Millennium Falcon 
Lego kits and Queen Anne's Revenge Lego kits, all of which retail 
between $100 to $150 each, Iwaskewycz said.

Police say the 34-year-old mother used the same debit card in almost every transaction she completed

Detectives
found dozens of bags filled with toys inside Aqueveque's Sunrise home. 
'Greed overcame her lack of common sense,' Iwaskewycz said.

She
has been charged with grand theft, organized scheme to defraud and 
dealing in stolen property and has been released on $9,500 bond.

Question
remain over what happened to the money as Aqueveque only had $36,000 in
her bank account at the time of her arrest, officers said.
