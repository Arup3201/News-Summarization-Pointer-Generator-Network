Malaysia's highest court has upheld a ban on Catholics using the word 'Allah' to refer to their own god, ending a years-long legal battle.

The verdict came in what was seen as a test case for the country's wider Christian congregation, but officials insist the verdict is confined to one Catholic newspaper.

Worshippers can still use 'Allah' to refer to God in church, the government said.

But the divisive case, in which the Catholic Church challenged a ban on its appropriation of the Arabic word, comes as minorities claim their rights are under threat from creeping Islamisation in Malaysia.

The government had previously banned the use of 'Allah' in the local Malay-language edition of the Church's Herald newspaper. The use of the word had angered Muslims, who say Christians are overstepping religious boundaries.

A seven-judge panel in Malaysia's administrative capital Putrajaya yesterday upheld a lower court decision which sided with the government's ban.

But a government spokesman later clarified: 'The ruling only applies to the Herald newspaper's use of the word "Allah". Malaysian Christians can still use the word "Allah" in church.'

Christians had argued that they had used the Arabic word to refer to God in Malay for centuries.

'The Christian community continues to have the right to use the word "Allah" in our Bibles, church services and Christian gatherings,' said Eu Hong Seng, chairman of the Christian Federation of Malaysia.

Lawyers for the Catholic Church said they would explore new ways to challenge the ban. They fear the ruling could be used as a precedent to curtail religious freedom in other cases.Â

Outside the court, amid tight 
security, around a hundred Muslim activists cheered the news of the 
verdict. Earlier, they had shouted 'Allahu Akbar' (God is great) and 
waved banners that read, 'Uniting to defend the name of Allah'.

'We
 must defend Allah because this is our religious obligation. I hope 
other communities, including Christians, understand this,' Ibrahim Ali, 
head of Muslim rights group Perkasa, told AFP.

The
 dispute first erupted in 2007 when Malaysia's home ministry threatened 
to revoke the Herald's publishing permit for using the Arabic word in 
its Malay-language edition.

The
 Church launched a court case to challenge the directive, arguing that 
'Allah' had been used for centuries in Malay-language Bibles and other 
literature to refer to 'God' outside of Islam.

But
 authorities argued that using 'Allah' in non-Muslim literature could 
confuse Muslims and entice them to convert - a crime in Malaysia.

In
 2009 a court ruled in favour of the Catholic Church, sparking a spate 
of attacks on houses of worship. Last October, an appeals court 
reinstated the ban.

Malaysia
 has largely avoided overt religious conflict in recent decades, but 
tensions have been growing. Two petrol bombs were thrown at a Malaysian 
church in January, causing minor damage.

Also in January, Islamic authorities seized hundreds of Bibles, which contained the word 'Allah', from a Christian group.

The divisive case, in which the Catholic Church challenged a ban on its appropriation of the Arabic word, comes as minorities claim their rights are under threat from creeping Islamisation in Malaysia

Around 2.6million people among the Southeast Asian nation's 28million people are Christians, who come from mostly ethnic Chinese, Indian or indigenous backgrounds, while 60 percent are Muslim ethnic Malay.

Minorities have long resented a decades-old positive discrimination policy which favours Malays in education, housing and employment.

Prime Minister Najib Razak, who took office in 2009, has increasingly rolled back his initial reformist and conciliatory rhetoric in a bid to please hardliners of his United Malays National Organisation, which has ruled the country virtually uninterrupted since independence in 1957.

'The idea is to use this as a political weapon to raise tensions,' James Chin, a political science professor at Monash University, told AFP.

'They (the ruling party) feel that this is a vote-winner for the next election.'
