A Hollywood skin specialist to the stars accused of plotting to kill her main competitor in a 'murder-for-hire' scheme allegedly posted fake sex ads looking for gay partners about her rival online.

Dawn DaLuise, who has counted Jennifer Aniston, Sarah 
Michelle Gellar and Christian Slater among clients at her salon, made Craigslist postings inviting men to turn up unannounced at the home of Gabriel Suarez for 'trysts', according to a series of text messages seen by RadarOnline. 

The 55-year-old was reportedly furious when Suarez, who is also an esthetician, moved into the same building as her salon, Skin Refinery in Santa Monica.

 today

She allegedly hired a former Detroit Lions player Chris Geile as a hit man to kill the competitor. He has not been arrested or charged and denies involvement.

The explosive new allegations today revealed that DaLuise texted a friend: 'I’m putting a posting up abt (sic) him 
wanting sex on CL [Craigslist] this week (only well hung black men need 
apply!).'

Edward Feinsteini, 28, has been arrested for alleged cyber-stalking

In another she allegedly wrote: 'I am putting together a CL (Craigslist) 
ad to run soon directing guys to Gabriel’s front door. No need to call 
first! Just show up; I’ll be waiting in bed with an (sic) blindfold on!'

DeLuise allegedly told the friend that in the ad, she encouraged men to barge into Suarez's home and claimed that he would be waiting in bed wearing a blindfold. 

DaLuise also reportedly told her friend that she intended to go to Starbucks to set up the Craigslist ads so that her IP address could not be traced.

According to the Radar report, she also suggested stalking Suarez's sister.

In a bizarre twist, the friend to whom DaLuise sent the text messages, Edward Feinstein, 28, has been arrested for stalking her.

Feinstein allegedly made flyers with a sexually explicit photo of DaLuise's face, home address, phone number and distributed them publicly. 

He is also accused of making his own fake Craigslist ads pretending that DaLuise wanted men to help her act out a 'rape fantasy', according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff.

Feinstein was released on bond and is due to appear in court on May 14.

DaLuise believed that the person who made the ads about her was Suarez - and the threat to her and her daughters' safety was her motivation for the murder-for-hire plot, she has claimed.

She was charged last week for solicitation to commit murder and is currently being held on $1 million bail.

Intended victim Mr Suarez operated Smooth Cheeks, a salon just minutes away from DaLuise's business on Santa Monica Boulevard.

A representative for DaLuise told MailOnline they did not have a comment at present.

According to her website, DaLuise moved to California to become a model in the 1980s.

Driven
 by her own sun-damaged skin, she enrolled in beauty school in the 1990s
 and treats clients with electrical muscule stimulation, rather than 
'steams and creams'.

Her 
Electrical Muscle Stimulation facials cost $125 a session and claim to 
help dru skin, wrinkles or damage from chemical peels. A 40-minute 
facial costs $80, while wax treatments cost up to $90.

DaLuise also includes Freddie Prinze Jr., Alicia Silverstone, Alyson Hannigan, Christina Ricci, Kyra Sedwick and Bridget Moynahan among her clients.
