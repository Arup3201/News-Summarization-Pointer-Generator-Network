Death: Bernadine 'Bernie' Ingram, 57, had been on board a yacht when it was hit by a 5,000-ton dredger

A wife was killed on a yacht in a freak accident on a summer’s day, it was revealed today.

Bernadine 'Bernie' Ingram, 57, had been on board her yacht Orca  with her husband Peter when it was hit by the 5,000-ton dredger Shoreway in the North Sea off the Suffolk coast.

Mrs Ingram had been wearing a life jacket as she sunbathed on deck when her 29ft craft was hit by the 321ft ship in clear conditions.

A huge wave sparked by the crash which slammed her into the galley, trapping her as the boat quickly sank about six miles off Felixstowe.

Today, Dutch seaman Gerardus Chapel, from Papendrecht in the western Netherlands, admitted failing to discharge his duties properly as the officer of the watch on the dredger.

Mark Watson, prosecuting, said the incident happened at about 1.30pm on June 8.

He told Ipswich Magistrates’ Court that Chapel was in charge of the Shoreway’s course when it collided with the Orca, with the Ingrams and their two Border Collie dogs aboard.

The yacht was holed in the hull and sank immediately. The Cypriot-registered dredger had been on its way out to sea at the time.

Mr Watson told the court: ‘There came a stage where it changed course slightly from the deep water channel and proceeded south into an area which is known to be frequented by sailing yachts, especially at the weekend.’

The Ingrams, who had set sail from Levington, near Ipswich, were returning home after going out to sea on a sunny day. 

Mr Ingram was at the helm and saw the Shoreway in the distance, the court heard. It appeared to be in the deep water channel.

Mr Ingram, of Butley, Suffolk, was not heading towards the channel but was sailing parallel to it.

He ducked below deck to go the toilet for no longer than a couple of minutes leaving his wife on deck at the back of the yacht.

Mr Ingram, who is a Labour party advisor and former chief technology officer of telecoms regulator Ofcom, went back up to find the huge dredger just feet away from his craft.

The ship then hammered into his yacht, striking the starboard anchor of the Shoreway. Mr Watson said: ‘The Orca was hulled pretty much amidships and began to take on water.’

Shell-shocked Mr Ingram was trapped in the cabin as it quickly filled with water. He was only able to escape after a desperate struggle to save his life, the court heard.

Mr Ingram assumed his wife Bernie had been swept into the sea as she was on deck.

But an enormous surge of water had dragged the doctor’s receptionist into the galley and she drowned as the yacht plunged below the waves.

The terrifying accident triggered a full-scale sea search backed up by a rescue team from Felixstowe, two lifeboats from Harwich, one from Walton-on-the-Naze and two harbour boats from Harwich.

Mrs Ingram’s body was recovered from her wrecked boat the next day while one of her beloved pet dogs also died in the incident.

Ian Lawrie, QC, defending Chapel, said the case centred on an ‘omission to do something’ and came down to ‘human frailty’.

The case was committed to Ipswich Crown Court for sentencing on a future date and the experienced seaman was freed on unconditional bail.

A Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesman said: ‘The sentencing range for this type of offence is anything from unconditional discharge, to an unlimited fine to two years imprisonment.’

Much-loved Mrs Ingram had worked as a doctors’ receptionist at the Peninsula Practice in Orford, Suffolk, for 14 years. She set up and ran a special support group for patients battling cancer.

Her devastated colleagues saluted the ‘love, kindness and care’ Mrs Ingram gave patients and colleagues as they paid tribute to her at her funeral.

Councillor Mark Bee, leader of Suffolk County Council, said at the time: ‘We’re most saddened by her tragic death. We’ve been in contact with Peter to offer our full support at this most difficult time.’
