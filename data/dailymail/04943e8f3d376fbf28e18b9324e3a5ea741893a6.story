Jack Anthony Jackson Jr, of Park Place, Brooklyn, was gunned down on the Willoughby Avenue, close to Brooklyn Charter School, just before 11pm local time last night.

Emergency services rushed to the scene but he was pronounced dead at the scene. His attacker is still at large, police said.

One if the men pulled a gun and shot him in the chest, it was reported.

'He passed me just five minutes before it happened,' a 64-year-old resident of the block told the New York Daily News.

'We talked for a second. He said he was dropping off a bag at a friend's house ... He walked away singing a song. Next thing I know, that's it.'

A witness said there were two gunshots and when he ran down the block he discovered the victim dying on the floor
