A British adventurer hunting for Second World War Spitfires he believes are buried in Burma plans to continue his search – despite suffering a health scare at the end of an unsuccessful excavation project.

David Cundall, 62, fell ill in his hotel in Burma’s former capital Rangoon, where a £1 million dig for some of the aircraft was called off on Friday.

The Lincolnshire farmer was taken to hospital, treated for high blood pressure and advised not to fly. But last night he was preparing to board a plane to travel 900 miles to the civil-war-torn city of Myitkina in the north of Burma, where he plans to begin a second dig almost single-handedly.

Excavation: Heavy diggers were brought in to help with the search for the buried Spitfires but archaeologists now believe there is no evidence support the claim that the rare aircraft are buried there

Mr Cundall had worked in searing 95F heat at the Rangoon excavation site, an old British airfield, before the project was declared a failure after archaeologists working with him concluded there was nothing to find.

But he said: ‘I believe the Spitfires are here and I’m not going to give up. Spitfires are held in very high regard. They saved our necks in the Battle of Britain and are very precious.’

Up to 136 of the aircraft, worth up to
£1.5 million each, are rumoured to have been buried in crates in three 
locations around Burma at the end of the Second World War.

The British are said to have hidden the planes to prevent them falling into enemy hands.
