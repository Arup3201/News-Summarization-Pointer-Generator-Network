A ferocious winter storm is causing massive cancellations and delays at the East Coat's major airports along with dangerous driving conditions for Thanksgiving travelers across the country.

Those who could scrambled to book earlier flights on Tuesday to 
avoid sprawling winter storm Boreas which is bearing down on the East Coast with a messy mix 
of snow, rain and wind.

By Wednesday morning, Boreas will impact the entire East Coast, likely creating havoc on the roads and in the air on the busiest travel day of the year.

A combination of high winds and low clouds are likely to cause delays at all New York, Boston and Washington airports. Parts of Pennsylvania, including Pittsburgh, and upstate New York could get up to 18-inches of snow.

As of Tuesday, the storm was responsible
 for 14 deaths in five states. Most were tied to traffic accidents in Oklahoma, Texas, California, New Mexico and Arizona.

A four-year-old girl was killed in Roosevelt County, New Mexico on Friday when her family's car slid off the road and flipped over, state police reported.

A man's body was recovered by fire crews on Friday after it is believed he was swept away by swelling waters in the Santa Cruz River, Arizona.

Tom Niziol, winter weather expert at The Weather Channel, said: 'By the time this is over, Winter Storm Boreas (the rain and snowy side) will affect more than 32 states and will have impacted more than 200 million people.'

The wintry weather set in on Tuesday in the interior Northeast. Buffalo, Pittsburgh and the Ohio Great Lakes region suffered heavy snowfall.

The Appalachian Mountains, West 
Virginia, western Pennsylvania and northern New York could get six to 12
 inches of snow on Wednesday before the storm moves into western Maine 
on Thursday.

East of the snow front, the I-95 highway corridor from Boston to New York could receive 2 to 3-1/2 inches of rain.

Meteorologists warned that the storm, which has moved across the country, would almost certainly upset holiday travel plans on Wednesday for those hoping to visit loved ones in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast.

Expert Chris Vaccaro told weather.com that heavy rain and high winds would impact travel by air and road in the northeast and mid-Atlantic and have a ripple effect on airports with departing and originating flights elsewhere.

Many travelers were moving to earlier flights, taking advantage of airlines' policies to waive their normal change fees.

Lisa Jablon was originally supposed to fly Delta from New York City to Syracuse, New York, on Wednesday at 9.30am.

But after following the storm's movements, she decided to jump on the last flight out on Tuesday night.

'I'm
 flying up to spend the holiday with my boyfriend's family and I didn't 
want to get stuck,' Jablon said. 'The rain seems to be better off 
tonight than it looks tomorrow morning.'

Those traveling by train on the East Coast on Tuesday evening also faced delays. Around 6pm at Penn Station in Manhattan on Tuesday, the board showed delays on all departing trains.

The good news is that the storm is 
supposed to pass through the Northeast before Thanksgiving Day, with the
 weather mostly clearing up by Wednesday evening.

Most airlines are hoping the storms won't be too severe, allowing them to continue operating a nearly full schedule with few cancellations, but likely a lot of delays, said Daniel Baker, CEO of FlightAware, a global flight tracking service.

Despite severe weather forecasts across the U.S., the most hardened bargain-hunters paid little heed as they bedded down early for Black Friday deals.

Identical triplet brothers in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio were the first in line for the sales when they set up a camp outside the local Best Buy last Monday afternoon - a full ten days before Thanksgiving.

Jonas Allooh and his two brothers have been camping out for Black Friday deals for the past four years, but were tired of always being second in line. This year, they made it a point to get out earlier to be the first.

Best Buy - along with retailers including Macy's, J.C. Penney and Staples -  will open on Thanksgiving for the first time this year. 

Toys R Us will open at 5pm., and Wal-Mart -  already open 24 hours in many locations - will start holiday deals at 6pm, two hours earlier than last year.

In recent years, some retail employees and their supporters have started online petitions to protest stores that open on Thanksgiving - but shoppers keep coming.

'Cancellations are used as a good, preventative measure to avoid cascading delays that can negatively impact travelers thousands of miles away,' Baker said.

Heavy rain and high winds would affect travel by air and road in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic and could have a ripple effect on airports with departing and originating flights elsewhere.

Heavy rain and breezy conditions were in the forecast Wednesday from the Carolinas to the Northeast, with ice and snow a possibility in the Appalachians, western Pennsylvania and western New York.

The storm system could also spawn isolated tornadoes in the Florida Panhandle. The Southeast is set to suffer soaking rain in the coming days, primarily in Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky.

'It couldn't have come at a worse time,' said meteorologist Tim Morrin of the National Weather Service.

'Visibility will be restricted not only by the rain and wash from other cars, but from the fog.'

This holiday will likely see the most air travelers since 2007, according to Airlines for America, the industry's trade and lobbying group, with the busiest day being Sunday, an estimated 2.56 million passengers. Wednesday is expected to be the second-busiest, with 2.42 million passengers.

 300 flights American Airlines and American Eagle were canceled in and 
out of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on Monday due to the 
weather.

Ninety
 per cent of travelers this week will drive, according to AAA, and an 
estimated 38.9 million people - 1.6 per cent fewer than last year - are 
expected to drive 50 miles or more from their home.

As the holiday approaches on November
 28, high winds could ground the giant character balloons in the Macy's 
Inc Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City.

City rules bar the huge balloons 
from flying when sustained winds top 23 miles per hour (37 km per hour),
 and gusts exceed 34 mph.

Current forecasts call for sustained winds of 20 mph and gusts of 36 mph.

'At
 this time, it is too early to make any determinations on the flight of 
the giant balloons,' said Macy's spokesman Orlando Veras.

'On
 Thanksgiving morning, Macy's works closely with the NYPD, who, based on
 real time weather data and the official regulations determine if the 
balloons will fly and at what heights.'

The 
storm is combining with a cold front that dropped temperatures to minus 
3F (minus 19.4C) at Saranac Lake, New York, the coldest spot in the 
contiguous United States on Monday morning.

New Hampshire's Supreme Court was briefly forced to close on Monday because it had lost heat and electricity.

Meanwhile, forecasters were predicting 5
 to 8 inches of snow in Buffalo, more in the northern Adirondacks, and a
 winter storm watch was posted for central New York state with heavy 
rain expected in parts of the Hudson Valley.

In the nation's capital, federal agencies opened on Tuesday though the National Weather Service issued a winter weather advisory for the northern and western suburbs of Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, amid forecasts of a light mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain that could be topped off by heavy rain.

The U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management, which sets leave policies for 300,000 federal workers in 
Washington, said that while government was open on Tuesday, employees could
 take unscheduled leave or unscheduled telework.
