Karen Dunlap, from Texas, had to be rushed to hospital after swallowing a piece of wire brush

A woman in Texas had to have emergency surgery after swallowing a wire bristle from a barbecue brush that got stuck to her grilled chicken.

Karen Dunlap was rushed to the emergency room after eating what she thought was a piece of crispy chicken, but turned out to be a metal wire.

Doctors found the offending object after Karen complained of pain radiating from her esophagus every time she swallowed.

She told Fox Detroit: 'It was really the best grilled chicken he'd ever made, I was like wow! This is so good and I'm eating it and the third bite I bit down on something hard.

'I thought at first it was a charred piece of the chicken or something and as I swallowed it I realized no, this is not something I should be swallowing.'

Karen's husband had used a wire scraper to clean the grill before cooking, but left one of the bristles behind which then got stuck to the food.

Doctors quickly removed the offending object, after which Karen says she felt much better.

Experts say the wire fell off the brush after the heat of the grill loosened the plastic holding it in place

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warn that using metal brushes on grill can be dangerous, especially if the bristles are mounted in plastic.

If the grill is hot the plastic will loosen, allowing them to slip out and stick to the grill bars and then to food.

They advise only using a wire brush on a cold grill, or using a wooden spatula. While it comes with a straight edge, it will eventually char to fit around the grill bars.
