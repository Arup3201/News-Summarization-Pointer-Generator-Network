A man who took his girlfriend out for dinner to apologise after an argument choked to death on a piece of steak in front of her, an inquest heard.

Alan Lobban, 61, had taken his partner Glenys Ashmead, 62, out for a pub meal following a row at his flat in Gloucester.

However, the evening turned to tragedy when the former hairdresser started choking after taking just ‘two or three mouthfuls’ of meat.

The inquest into his death, at Gloucester Coroner’s Office, heard how Mr Lobban was ‘too drunk’ to cough up the steak meat and ‘keeled over’ in front of his horrified partner and other diners at The Fountain Inn, Gloucester.

He was pronounced dead by paramedics at the pub on March 29 last year.

Ms Ashmead, who had known Mr Lobban for just 12 months, told today’s inquest: ‘We were at his flat when we had an argument. I left and Alan came after me and said we should go for a meal.

‘Between 9pm and 9.30pm our food arrived. Alan had taken two or three mouthfuls when he started vomiting and keeled over.’

A post mortem examination found Mr Lobban had ‘significant’ levels of ethanol in his system when he died.

Recording the cause of death as accidental, Coroner Katie Skerrett said: ‘It is unlikely he was able to chew meat properly.

Speaking after the inquest, Glenys Ashmead, from Gloucester, said: 'Alan's death was such a shock to me, I'm still trying to come to terms with it.
The way he went was so sudden, it was such a terrible tragedy'

‘He was trying to swallow pieces of meat while he was heavily intoxicated which affects the ability to cough.’

A pathologist’s report said there was a heavy smell of alcohol coming from his body, and recorded 242 milligrammes of alcohol in his blood.

Speaking after the inquest, Ms Ashmead, from Gloucester, said: ‘Alan’s death was such a shock to me, I’m still trying to come to terms with it.

‘The way he went was so sudden, it was such a terrible tragedy. He was loved by everyone who knew him.’
