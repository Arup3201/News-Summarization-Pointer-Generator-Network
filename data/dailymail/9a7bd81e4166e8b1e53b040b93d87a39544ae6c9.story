Sean Penn is now believed to have played a leading role in the mysterious escape of a New York businessman from Bolivian house arrest.

The current location of Jacob Ostreicher, an Orthodox Jew from Brooklyn who went to Bolivia to salvage a rice-growing business, is being kept a closely-guarded secret. But he is with the Oscar-winning actor, who says he is receiving medical attention.

The Bolivian government now regards Jacob Ostreicher, an Orthodox Jew from Brooklyn who went to Bolivia to salvage a rice growing business, as a fugitive.

The Oscar-winning actor has been involved in Mr Ostreicher's plight ever since he was arrested in 2011 as part of a money laundering probe and even met with the President of Bolivia last year in an effort to get Mr Ostreicher moved from prison to house arrest.

On Monday, Penn confirmed that Mr Ostreicher was freed as a result of a 'humanitarian operation' to free him 'from the corrupt prosecution and imprisonment he was suffering in Bolivia'.

In the email to the AP, Penn said only that Ostreicher was safe, doing well and receiving medical attention in the actor's company at an undisclosed location.

With U.S.-Bolivia relations strained since Morales expelled the American ambassador in 2008, Penn was one of the few people Ostreicher could turn to. The actor was a frequent guest of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and a sharp critic of U.S. foreign policy - two qualities that endear him to Morales and other leftist leaders in Latin America.

After Penn intervened, Morales ordered a high-powered investigation that exposed an extortion ring that preyed on people accused of drug-related crimes.

It led to the arrests of 15 people, including several prosecutors and the top legal adviser at the Interior Ministry, who had repeatedly flown from the capital to the eastern city of Santa Cruz for court hearings to ensure Ostreicher was not freed from prison.

Ostreicher was housed at a prison, Palmasola, whose interior was controlled by violent inmates. In August, 31 prisoners died in a battle between rival factions.

Adding to his troubles were the increasing tremors he was dealing with as his Parkinson’s disease worsened with poor treatment.

He had been freed from jail in December 2012 at a hearing attended by Penn but barred from leaving Bolivia. A frustrated Penn vowed he wouldn't abandon him.

‘If it weren't for Sean Penn I would be another statistic in Bolivia and I would die in prison,’ Ostreicher told the AP a year ago.

Previous efforts on his behalf by U.S. diplomats and lawmakers had proved fruitless.

The New York Times reports that once he was moved to house arrest, it was one of the most loosely-guarded situations imaginable, with no guards watching him. Officially, he only had to be in the home between the hours of 9pm and  6am, and was told to check in with authorities every 15 days.

Now that word of his escape is causing political optics issues, Bolivian officials are floating the theory that he could have been kidnapped or even travelled to Peru on his own during the day when he was not confined to the house in Santa Cruz.

Mr Ostreicher's relatives are understandably keeping his whereabouts under wraps, though one of the Brooklyn native's children confirmed that they had heard he had arrived in America but had yet to speak to him directly.

‘You'll never find out,’ Peter Hakim, president emeritus of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington, said Tuesday.

If the U.S. was involved, ‘it was done through layers and layers of cover,’ he said.

Mr Ostreicher, an Orthodox Jew who has a flooring business in Brooklyn, complained from the time he was jailed in June 2011 that he was being fleeced by corrupt officials.

His case came to notice when he accused the struggling rice venture's original manager, a Colombian woman who also was jailed, of defrauding investors and falling in with a Brazilian drug trafficker.

Ostreicher charged later that prosecutors and other government employees had illegally sold 18,000 metric tons of the venture's rice and stole equipment as well as demanded a $50,000 payoff to get him out of jail.

'They robbed me of close to $50 million worth of assets,' Ostreicher told the AP in an interview a year ago. He said that in addition to the rice, about 900 cattle disappeared along with 37 tractors and harvesting equipment.

Bolivian authorities have said since that 15 people had been arrested in the alleged extortion ring, including an assistant to the judicial director of the Interior Ministry.

Last June, prosecutors said two low-ranking officials among those arrested had pleaded guilty and were cooperating in hopes of serving less jail time.

The case has resulted in Bolivian authorities implicating a judge, the initial prosecutors and lower-level officials in an alleged scheme to shake down Ostreicher and other people deemed to have deep pockets.
