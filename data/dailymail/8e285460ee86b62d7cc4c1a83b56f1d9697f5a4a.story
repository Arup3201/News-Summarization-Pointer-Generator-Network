Shrien Dewani hired a driver to have 'a woman removed from sight' in a staged honeymoon carjacking just minutes after arriving in Cape Town, his murder trial has heard.

Zola Tongo was recruited by Dewani for the contract killing of his wife Anni Dewani, 28, after dropping the couple off at a five-star hotel in Cape Town where they were spending part of their honeymoon.

Tongo is currently serving 18 years for his role in the murder of Mrs Dewani in November 2010, and has always claimed it was Dewani who masterminded it.

Murder accused Shrien Dewani hired taxi driver Zola Tongo to kill his wife Anni, just minutes after arriving in South Africa to begin his honeymoon, a South African court has heard

Tongo, who is currently serving 18 years jail for the murder, said Dewani approached him about the contract killing after he dropped the newlyweds off at their hotel, having collected them at the airport

The Swedish newlywed was found dead from a single gunshot wound to her neck, still wearing her evening dress, in the back of Tongo's abandoned car after it was ambushed during a late night township tour.

Flanked by heavily-armed prison guards, bald-headed Tongo told the court that Dewani had approached him about 'a job' after checking in to the Cape Grace hotel after he had picked the couple up from the airport. 

Dewani, 34, promised to pay £1,350 for her murder and £282 for organising it, Cape Town's high court was told.

Once Tongo had agreed to make inquiries with a friend who would have better contacts, the men swapped numbers and kept in touch. The following day – the morning of Mrs Dewani's murder, Tonga took Dewani to change a large amount of cash, and thrashed out the details of the murder.

The wealthy Bristol-based businessman had already hatched a plan, the court heard.

Tongo said when he picked the newlyweds up from dinner, shortly before the murder was to take place, they seemed happy, the car was 'full of laughter'

'He [Dewani] wanted a car to be hijacked, and they must be robbed, then they must drop me along the way and they must also drop him along the way. And they must kill the woman,' Tongo told Cape Town's high court via an interpreter.

Dewani looked closely at Tongo throughout his evidence, making notes which he occasionally sent over the dock to his legal team.

Tongo was put in touch with two gunmen Xolile Mngeni and Mziwamadoda Qwabe who agreed to carry out the hit in Gugulethu, a township outside the city centre. The men met up to finalise the details hours before Tongo was due to collect the the Dewanis from their hotel and drive them to a restaurant.

After they had agreed the location where the hitmen would lie in wait to ambush the vehicle, Tongo went home and had a change of heart.

Anni was found dead from a single gunshot wound to her neck, still wearing her evening dress, in the back of Tongo's abandoned car after it was ambushed during a late night township tour in November 2010

'My knees were shaking,' he told the court, as Mrs Dewani's family sat forward, straining to hear every painful detail about the plot that ended her life.

Tongo said he tried but failed to find another driver to carry out the job.

He later collected Dewani and his 'beautiful' bride from the Cape Grace and took them on a city tour before dropping them at a restaurant out of town.

Tongo stayed in touch with Dewani and the killers during the meal, and when he picked them up they seemed happy, the car was 'full of laughter', he said.

But as he drove to the appointed corner in Gugulethu the two killers were not there which prompted Dewani to look at him in the rear view mirror with 'big eyes' and send him a text message demanding to know what had happened.

Tongo will continue giving evidence tomorrow. Dewani denies five charges including murder and kidnapping.
