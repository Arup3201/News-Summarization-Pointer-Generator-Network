The stripper who tried to unlock her husband's handcuffs using an earring in the back of a cop car has been sentenced to 18 months under house arrest.

Melissa Schneider, 27, and Jonathan Kokontis, 25 - who are parents to a four-year-old boy - were arrested in September following a series of vehicle burglaries in Seminole County, Florida.

En route to the police station, a bizarre video captured by the patrol car surveillance system showed the pair's 30-minute attempt to break free - using an earring.

House arrest: Melissa Schneider, 27, tearfully agreed to a plea bargain involving 18 months' house arrest

Caught: Jonathan Kokontis, 25, told his girlfriend Melissa Schneider, 27 that he would be going to prison for a long time minutes after they were arrested and put in a patrol car in Seminole County, Florida

Emotional: She leans her head into his chest and starts to cry, prompting Kokontis to consider the best way to get out of the car 

Kokontis, a two-time ex-convict, could be heard telling Schneider that he would be going to jail for a long time due to his lengthy criminal record.

Schneider started crying - so Kokontis suggested an escape.

At first Schneider tries to reach through the bars to open the door.

Then, after a passionate kiss, one of her gold hoops fall onto the seat, and Kokontis tries to use it as a key. 

Escape bid: His first idea is for her to try and reach through the bars in the window and open the door lever. But she says she can't do it

Plan B: Kokontis then takes his girlfriend's earring and tries - and fails - to pick the lock on his handcuffs. To hid the jewelry he puts it in his mouth, but then spits it back out 

Thwarted: The deputy then opens the door and asks about the earring. He believes Schneider's excuse 

The plot was foiled after a deputy spotted the earring and confiscated it - and though Kokontis pushed his way out the car and fled, he was later captured.

On Thursday, three weeks after Kokontis was jailed for 30 years, Schneider pleaded guilty to aiding escape and tearfully agreed to a plea bargain, involving 18 months' house arrest and rehabilitation for heroin addiction. 

After the hearing, Schneider told the Orlando Sentinel: 'I just lost my husband for 30 years. ...The judge is so mean.' 

Kokontis, who was jailed on December 17, managed to escape after asking the deputy to loosen his handcuffs then pushing past him.

He was later captured trying to steal a car that wouldn't start. A police dog bit him during the arrest.

The 25-year-old pleaded guilty to escape, battery of a law enforcement officer and four counts of burglary.  

Desperation: Kokontis then leans out of the door and asks the officer to loosen his cuffs after all other attempts have failed 

Push: The felon, in one last bid for freedom, runs past the officer and briefly escapes custody. He was returned to the vehicle a short time later
