Most people are quite happy with a £1.80p pack of Andrex.

But if you're wanting to give your derriere the treatment that's fit for an Emperor, you might wish to try this overtly lavish Japanese toilet paper.

The brand, known as Hanebisho, comes at a price, of course.

A three-pack will cost you 5,000Yen (around £32), meaning a single roll works out at about £11 - many times more expensive than your average supermarket brand.

Lavish: Japan's Hanebisho brand of toilet paper is considered the world's most expensive at around £11 a roll

Exquisite: Hanebisho is made using the finest wood fibre pulp from Canada and treated with water from the Nyodo River, which was ranked Japan's cleanest in 2010

Hanebisho paper, considered the world's most expensive, is made using the finest wood fibre pulp from Canada and treated with water from the Nyodo River, which was ranked Japan's cleanest in 2010.

Production is a delicate operation similar to making pancakes that uses heat at just the right temperature to make sure the paper doesn't burn and comes out wonderfully soft.

The maker of each roll then signs their name and date of production before sending it to the company president for inspection, it was reported by odditycentral.com.

He has reportedly tested every roll on his own skin for the last ten years.

The product has reportedly been presented to the Emperor of Japan for five years.

According to the Hanebisho website, the toilet paper feels 'as if your skin is being gently swathed in silk'.

One client wrote on the site: 'I gave my father Hanebisho for a Father's Day present.

'He thought the wrapping paper and toilet paper itself were so beautiful he put them on display in the living room! He looked very happy.'
