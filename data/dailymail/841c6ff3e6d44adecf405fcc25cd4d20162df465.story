Once the exclusive preserve of science fiction, manufacturers have promised motorists that space age cars will soon become science fact.

The quest for effortless travelling will take a major new step forward when 'gesture control' motoring is unveiled.

Car manufacturers are working on a system that will allow drivers to many of the internal controls by moving their hands close to sensor panels.

The new 'gesture control' is being pioneered by several manufacturers with Land Rover unveiling a mock-up at the New York motor show (file picture)

The system will enable motorists to operate lights, indicators and open and close doors all with a simple gesture.

It will also mean the end to door handles as the person holding the keys will be able to open the car doors by a swiping movement.

The move is the latest in a series of technological advances that are set to revolutionise motoring.

But there are fears blank key fobs could be programmed by hacking through the security system in the car's computer to allow thieves to drive the vehicle away.

The new 'gesture control' is being pioneered by several manufacturers with Land Rover unveiling a mock-up at the New York motor show.

The vehicle featured doors without handles and no indicators with both being operated by gestures.

The technology works by using cameras to capture the driver's movements with software interpreting specific hand movements and then passing the information on to the car' computer.

Dr Wolfgang Epple, research and technology director at Jaguar Land Rover, told the Sunday Times: 'For safety reasons some functions will be hardwired with switches, but many others could be operated by gesture control.

'We recognise that it is substantially more intuitive to use gestures than to press a button or turn a switch.'

A number of different controls are being developed for 'gesture' software with manufacturers saying windows, indicators, door locking and turning lights on and off could all be part of the new system.

Some 'gesture control' is already used in cars with drivers of the Mercedes SL able to open their boots when they waggle a foot under the rear bumper.

Ford has also applied for a patent for a swipe gesture system to lower or raise a window.

Roderick Murray-Smith, professor of computing science at Glasgow University, who previously worked for Mercedes, laid down a warning saying: 'Its use has to be carefully tuned for cars.

'If you wave your hand in annoyance at a car going by and suddenly the music's blasting at you, it could be distracting enough to be dangerous.'
