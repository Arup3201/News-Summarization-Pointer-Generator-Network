Mickey Rourke is well-known for his role in The Wrestler - yet the Hollywood actor has 'trained like a f****** animal' and shed weight in order to head into the boxing ring 20 years after his previous bout.

The 62-year-old was snapped looking trim and in tip-top shape in training ahead of his fight with 29-year-old American Elliott Seymour on Friday.

Renowned trainer Freddie Roach has been coaching the undefeated Rourke once more, having prepared him for eight fights in the 90s, ahead of his return to the ring followed a two-decade absence.

Rourke and Seymour will face each other in a five-round middleweight bout at Moscow's Rossiya concert hall on Friday, on the undercard of Ruslan Provodnikov's fight against Jose Luis Castillo.

Between 1991 and 1994, American Rourke fought eight times and claimed six professional victories - four by knockout - with two draws.

Yet he was forced to retire due to injury, but he insists that Russian Provodnikov inspired him to return.

Rourke, quoted on boxingscene.com, said: 'When I saw the fight between Ruslan and Tim Bradley, and saw how he fought, giving everything without reserve, then I came home and said to myself: "I want to fight again."

'Provodnikov was my inspiration. Thanks to him I want to fight again.

'When I fought 18 years ago and my trainer was Freddie Roach, I did not train hard. I was smoking, walking and not running. And now I decided that this time back I would train like a f****** animal.

'My last fight ended in a draw, but I'd rather have lost than got the draw. Regardless of the outcome, if I give a hundred per cent I can be proud of what I've done.' 

He first took to the ring as a 12-year-old and amassed 27 wins from 30 fights as an amateur between 1964 and 1973 before turning his attention to acting.

Rourke's original boxing career brought many injuries, forcing him to need reconstructive surgery to his face. 

However, Rourke is best-recognised for his acting career in which he won a Golden Globe, as well as being nominated for an Oscar, for his starring role as a past-his-prime fighter in The Wrestler in 2008.

He has also appeared in films including Diner, Barfly, Sin City, Iron Man 2 and The Expendables.
