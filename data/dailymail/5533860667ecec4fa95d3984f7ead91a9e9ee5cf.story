Last year did not end well for Dan Stevens' most famous character, Matthew Crawley, who made a shock exit from ITV's popular period drama Downton Abbey on Christmas Day.

But 2012 rang out on a very high note for the actor himself, who has been crowned Britain's best-dressed man by GQ magazine, pipping fellow actors Robert Pattinson, Eddie Redmayne and Tom Hiddleston to the top spot on the annual list.

And Prince Charles will also welcome 2013 with a smile on his face: the Duke of Cornwall beat both his sons - Princes William and Harry - into the top ten.

Dan Stevens (aka cousin Matthew Crawley), pictured right with his wife Susie, beat all competition to the top of GQ's annual best-dressed man list

Meanwhile, at the other end of the scale, singer Ed Sheeran came top of Britain's worst-dressed list, followed by Labour MP for Dagenham and Rainham Jon Cruddas, and Chantelle Houghton's ex-boyfriend Alex Reid.

Prince Charles ranked eighth on the sartorially splendid list - just one place behind Twilight star Pattinson - while his son the Duke of Cambridge came 37th.

GQ magazine said William 'epitomises true British style', adding: 'Has the Duchess of Cambridge upped her husband's fashion game? It would appear so.'

Prince William, left, came 37th on the list while his father Prince Charles, centre, came eighth, and his brother Harry, right, did not make the top 10

But the magazine says of Charles that 'despite sticking to a classic uniform, he always looks on trend', adding: 'This is a man who knows what he likes, knows how to wear it and sticks with it whatever the prevailing fashions.'

It said: 'HRH may be bemused at being a fashion icon, but he's proved himself the king of tailoring.'

Newly knighted Tour de France and Olympic cycling champion Sir Bradley Wiggins is a new entry in the list at 30.

Other new names are Homeland star Damian Lewis (12), One Direction singer Zayn Malik (17), cross-dressing artist Grayson Perry (22), and Paralympic champion Jonnie Peacock (48).

After Stevens, the top five is completed by actor Tom Hiddleston, rapper Tinie Tempah, Radio 1 Breakfast Show host Nick Grimshaw and X Factor presenter Dermot O'Leary.

The Wire star Idris Elba is sixth, followed by Twilight star Pattinson and Charles, while funnyman David Walliams is ninth, with My Week With Marilyn actor Eddie Redmayne completing the top 10.

The top 50, compiled by a panel of experts, also includes Take That star Gary Barlow (11), Sir Elton John (21), Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch (24), Bond actor Craig (25), Prime Minister David Cameron (28), Jude Law (35) and David Beckham (36).

The Best-Dressed Men List is in the February issue of GQ, available from Thursday.
