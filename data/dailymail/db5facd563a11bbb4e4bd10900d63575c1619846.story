A tattooed princess preserved in permafrost after 2,500 years is to be reinterred amid fears her upheaval sparked a series of natural disasters.

The mummified remains of the Russian ice maiden were discovered 21 years ago in a high altitude plateau in the heart of south-western Siberia.

But her removal led to concern among local elders who called for her to be put back in her final resting place to 'stop her anger that caused floods and earthquakes'.

The tattooed Russian ice maiden was discovered 21 years ago in a high altitude plateau in the heart of south-western Siberia

When the mummy was found by scientist Natalia Polosmak in 1993 she was heralded as 'one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of the 20th century'

She was thought to be about 25 years old when she died of suspected cancer and was found preserved in permafrost

Ancient beliefs dictate that her presence in the burial chamber had been to 'bar the entrance to the kingdom of the dead'.

Now the Siberian Times  has reported plans have finally been put forward to reinter the body back into the ground in the Russia's Altai Mountains and honour her with her own special mausoleum. 

Located on the pristine grasslands of the 2,500 metre high Ukok Plateau, the beautiful monument to Princess Ukok could be started next year.

The tattooed mummy was excavated by Novosibirsk scientist Natalia Polosmak in 1993 and was heralded as 'one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of the 20th century'.

Thought to be about 25 years old when she died of suspected cancer, she was found preserved in permafrost, with two men also discovered nearby.

Buried around her were six horses, saddled and bridled and said to have been her spiritual escorts to the next world, along with a meal of sheep and horse meat.

Archaeologists also found ornaments made from felt, wood, bronze and gold as well as a small container of cannabis and a stone plate on which coriander seeds were burned.

From her clothes and possessions including a 'cosmetics bag', scientists were able to recreate her fashion and beauty secrets.

She was dressed in a long shirt made from Chinese silk, and had long felt sleeve boots with a beautiful decoration on them.

At this time Chinese silk was only ever found in royal burials of the Pazyrk people, and since it was more expensive than gold it gave an indication of her wealth and status.

Elders in the Altai Mountains have long called for the mummified remains to be reburied on the Ukopk plateau

Elders insisted that the worst flooding in 50 years in Altai and a series of earthquakes were caused by the dead princess

Her head was completely shaved, and she wore a horse hair wig on top of which was a carving of a wooden deer.

The princess's face and neck skin was not preserved, but the skin of her left arm survived.

But the most exciting discovery was her elaborate body art, which many observers said bore striking similarities to modern-day tattoos.

On her left shoulder was a fantastical mythological animal made up of a deer with a griffon's beak and a Capricorn~s antlers. The antlers themselves were decorated with the heads of griffons.

The mouth of a spotted panther with a long tail could also be seen, and she had a deer's head on her wrist.

Elders in the Altai Mountains have long called for the mummified remains to be reburied on the Ukopk plateau to 'stop her anger which causes floods and earthquakes'.

They insisted that the worst flooding in 50 years in Altai and a series of earthquakes were caused by the dead princess.

Recently Russian scientists discovered that her death is likely to have been caused by cancer but that she also suffered a suspected fall from a horse late in her life.

She is believed to have been between 25 and 28 years old and about 1.62 metres tall.

Her remains were treated by the same scientists in Moscow who preserved the body of former Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin.

The plans to reinter the body back into the ground in the Russia's Altai Mountains and honour her with her own special mausoleum.

Work could start on the 2,500 metre high Ukok Plateau next year

Princess Ukok spent most of the past two decades at a scientific institute in Novosibirsk. Then she was moved to a specially designed chamber at the Republican National Museum in Gorno-Altaisk, but elders objected to her remains going on public display.

The first sketches of the plans for the new mausoleum were presented by Akai Kine, the zaisan (leader) of the Teles ethnic group, and president of the Spiritual Centre of the Turks Kin Altai.

He told the Siberian Times: 'According to the drafts, the mummy will be put in her original resting place, and on the top will be build funerary monument.

'The mausoleum will be located on the Ukok plateau in the place where the mummy was found by archaeologists in 1993.

'These are the first options for the future mausoleum. Publishing them, we want to start a public discussion in the media.

'There is no State decision on reburial of the Princess. But we have the main thing - we believe that this revered woman will be reburied.'

Local political leaders accept that she should be reburied.

Under the proposals put forward for the mausoleum the elders say any project should meet three basic requirements.

Akai Kine said: 'Firstly, the body should be reposed in the site of the original burial.

'Second, the mausoleum mound must be made according to the traditions that were followed when the Princess was buried.

'And third, scientists shall be granted access to the body.'
