To the billionaire Chinese developer recreating it, it will be ‘like a tree from which the whole world will enjoy the shade’.

Yesterday Ni Zhaoxing unveiled his £500million vision for a new Crystal Palace, which will put a missing piece of British history back in place.

The vast glass structure, the original of which was home to the Great Exhibition of 1851, will house his priceless art collection plus a hotel, conference centre and ‘other commercial space’.

Towering new Crystal Palace: Chinese real estate mogul Ni Zhaoxing is planning to build a new Crystal Palace structure to replace the original which was destroyed in a fire in 1936. It will be situated on a hilltop in Crystal Palace Park, south-east London, on the same spot as the original. The sport stadium is Crystal Palace athletics track

Vision: An artist's impression of what the re-built Crystal Palace could look like. If all goes to plan, building work will begin in 2015

Interior: What the newbuild Crystal Palace Park will look like inside. The plans are being supported by London Mayor Boris Johnson

But not everyone shares his enthusiasm. 
Protesters and some local councillors fear the ambitious scheme will 
choke one of London’s vital  green spaces.

Some were there at 
yesterday’s unveiling at the south London site to make their voices 
heard.

Mr Ni, chairman of Shanghai-based Zhong Rong Holdings, stressed that his
 plan includes restoration of the park on the original Victorian design.

Crystal Palace, named because of its innovative use of plate glass, was a
 breathtaking symbol of the British Empire and the crowning achievement 
of the Industrial Revolution. It stood in another part of the capital, 
Hyde Park, where the exhibition was held.

Vision: As well as rebuilding Crystal Palace the park will also be refurbished for the public. Pictured in this artist's impression is a new cafe. The new Crystal Palace structure can be seen in the distance above the trees

Flashback: The giant Crystal Palace centre before it was destroyed in a fire in 1936. The new building will be a replica of the original and cost around £500million

Developer: Mr Johnson shakes hands with billionaire Mr Ni Zhaoxing at the place where the proposed new Crystal Palace will be built

Parkland: This is the spot where the original Crystal Palace stood until it was destroyed in a fire in 1936. It has never been rebuilt

It was rebuilt on Penge Common, where it was used for further exhibitions, before being destroyed by fire in 1936.

All that remains are the listed Italian-style terraces and they will be incorporated in the new scheme.

Mr Ni, 57, whose art collection stretches from ancient relics to 
‘world-class oil paintings’, said he was inspired to rebuild the palace 
on visits to the UK while his two daughters studied here.

He said the project was ‘just like falling in love, getting married and having a child’.

‘It’s long-term hard work I can pass down to the next generation,’ he said, speaking in Chinese.

‘It’s like planting a tree in Crystal Palace to grow, then I can bring 
the tree to others. The whole world will enjoy the shade, local 
residents foremost, and once it has fruit on it you will profit the most
 – London the city and the people of London.’

Impression: This mocked-up photograph shows how 
the Crystal Palace may look among the houses, trees and tower blocks of 
the south-east London skyline. The original photograph was taken looking
 north from Shirley Hill, now known as Addington Hills, near Croydon

Fire of 1936: The original Palace stretched from
 what is now the bus station to the TV mast - and the Crystal Palace 
Community Association chairman said such a development would not be 
possible today

From above now: A Shanghai-based real estate 
firm will be putting a planning application in to the council later this
 year - but the news has been badly received by campaigners worried 
about development in the park

Last days: The Crystal Palace is shown in 1936, 
illuminated by the light of a Brocks fireworks display shortly before it
 burned down

Wreckage: The burnt out shell of a building which was left after the blaze in 1936. Nearly 80 years after it was destroyed, work may begin on a replacement in winter 2015

But Nick Goy, 52, a gardener who was among the protesters, said: ‘Parks 
are for people not for profit.We’re concerned it will be a commercial 
operation, take away grass and trees, and change the nature of the park.

‘When the original palace was built, it stood in the countryside. Now 
London is a very different place. It has expanded and we have very few 
green lungs like this left.’

The scheme  is backed by London Mayor Boris Johnson, who yesterday 
called it a ‘brilliant, original and simple vision by which south London
 will once again acquire a world-class cultural attraction’.

The land is owned by Bromley Council, which said consultation will now 
take place. A planning application could be submitted by next autumn, 
with construction possibly starting in winter 2015.

Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert had originally come up with the idea of an exhibition to show off Britain's industrial achievements.It was a huge triumph for Albert, who rarely enjoyed public popularity in Britain, and he used the profits made to help establish the South Kensington museums in central London.

Relocation: The Crystal Palace moved to Penge Common near Sydenham Hill in south-east London in 1854

Destruction: The Crystal Palace in the aftermath of the 1936 fire, witnessed by tens of thousands of people
