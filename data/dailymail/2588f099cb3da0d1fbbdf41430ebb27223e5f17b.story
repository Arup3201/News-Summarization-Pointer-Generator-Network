Died of his injuries: Bilal Khizar was knocked down and killed by a hit-and-run driver who was speeding away from police

A boy of 12 was knocked down and killed by a car being chased by police as he walked home from a friend’s birthday party.

Bilal Khizar was hit by the red Seat Ibiza as he crossed the road at a set of traffic lights at 7pm on Saturday.

Moments earlier, officers in a marked police car had pulled the vehicle over at a lay-by to carry out a routine check. As they got out to speak to the driver, the car suddenly sped off.

The two officers jumped back into their car and began pursuing the suspect at speed through Bradford. But as the speeding car headed along a 40mph dual carriageway towards the nearby M606, it struck the schoolboy.

Despite hitting the youngster, the Seat Ibiza continued towards the motorway and crashed into two further vehicles at a roundabout.

Officers discovered the car abandoned six miles away. Two men were later arrested and were last night continuing to be questioned by detectives.

The parents of the ‘fun-loving’ youngster, who was a keen rugby, cricket and football fan, were too distraught to comment.

They are said to have grown  concerned for him after he failed to return home on time and  began phoning his friends and family and contacting people  on Facebook.

They had no idea he had been involved in an accident and were still searching for him at 9pm on Saturday, friends said.

Bilal’s aunt, Nadia Karin, said: ‘He was such a happy child. He was loved by all the family and everyone at school. We just can’t believe he’s gone. We’re devastated.’ Tyre marks were clearly visible at the scene of the crash on Rooley Lane yesterday as specialist accident investigators set about the task of piecing together Bilal’s last moments.

Inconsolable: Mourners, believed to be the victim's relatives, attend the scene of the collision, which happened at around 7pm on Saturday

In a tragic twist, it emerged that just hours before his death Bilal had told his friends how he wanted a ‘yellow and happy’ funeral.

Eve Whitaker, 12, who left a tribute with her mother, teacher Sam, 44, and other friends, said: ‘He had left at about 6.40pm on his scooter to go home.

‘It’s so strange, just before he died we were talking about funerals. He said he wanted his to be yellow, with yellow flowers, nothing black. He wanted it to be happy.’

Ifrah Satti, 12, who was in the same class with Bilal at Bradford Academy, said: ‘I can’t believe what has happened. Bilal was so popular. He had been to a birthday party and was on his way home when he died.’

West Yorkshire Police has referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

A spokesman for the force said: ‘The incident happened when a marked police car stopped a red Seat Ibiza in a lay-by on Rooley Lane for a check.

‘As officers got out of their vehicle to speak to the driver the car immediately made off at speed along Rooley Lane. Officers got back into their car and followed it. The collision happened moments later.’

Tragedy: The boy was on a crossing on Rooley Lane, in Bradford, West Yorkshire, when he was hit by the red Seat Ibiza

The spokesman said the force was 
unable to reveal exactly what offences the two men in custody had been 
arrested for. But it will almost certainly include causing death by 
dangerous driving and fleeing the scene of an accident.

Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley said: ‘This is a tragedy for the family and they are absolutely devastated.

‘I am appealing directly to anyone who saw the vehicle being driven or the incident to get in contact.’
