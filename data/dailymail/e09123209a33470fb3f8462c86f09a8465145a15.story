A male model who ploughed his car into the side of a house at 80mph was more concerned about an upcoming photo shoot than the extensive damage he caused, a court has heard.

Storm Burger was speeding in his Audi A3 Quattro when he crashed into the property in Banstead, Surrey, where the limit is 30mph.

After the 21-year-old was cut out of the wrecked vehicle by firefighters, he asked whether he had any injuries to his face, worried it might affect a shoot with a fashion designer in Ibiza. 

Destruction: Storm Burger, 21, drove his Audi A3 Quattro through the front wall of the property after driving at 80mph in Banstead, Surrey

The 3.2 litre sports car veered off the road, hit the front 
wall of the house, smashed into a car parked in the drive, and embedding itself in an extension.

The impact caused thousands of pounds worth of damage while the car's engine was hurled out of its bonnet, landing eight metres away.

An accident investigator said there were 
no mechanical defects on the car before the crash and neighbours 
described hearing an engine roaring before the car smashed into the 
house.

Concerns: The 21-year-old had to be cut out of the car, but on the way to hospital he asked an officer whether there were any serious injuries to his face

Burger from Morden, south London, suffered no serious injuries and no-one was in the extension at the time of the collision.

Burger was ordered to pay Â£3,500 in fines or face six weeks in prison after being found guilty of dangerous driving, using a vehicle without insurance and driving not in accordance with a driving licence at Croydon Crown Court.

Burger told the court he regretted what happened and expressed his apologies.

Debris: The crash caused thousands of pounds in damage and the impact threw the car's engine eight metres

Speeding: An accident investigator confirmed there were no mechanical faults with the car

Witnesses: Neighbours described how they heard the engine roaring before it  smashed into the house
