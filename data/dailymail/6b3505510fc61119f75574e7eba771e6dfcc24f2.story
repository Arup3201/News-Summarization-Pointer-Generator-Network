A man was arrested after a four-hour armed siege with police after he claimed to have a gun and explosives in his house. 

Dozens of police - many of them heavily-armed - were involved in the tense stand-off in Huddersfield yesterday.

They rushed to the scene and evacuated houses after the man claimed to have a gun and an explosive device inside the house.

Tense: Heavily-armed police were involved in the standoff for four hours after the man claimed to have a weapon and explosives 

Drama: The housing estate in Huddersfield went into lockdown whilst police surrounded the house

Siege: Police wearing full body armour swarmed into the estate to protect the public

The drama eventually ended shortly after 5pm when police confirmed a man had been arrested.

Police cordons had sealed off a large area of the estate and Chief Inspector Jonathan Blackwell confirmed the siege had ended safely last night.

He said: 'At 5.08pm, the 31-year-old man left the property after officers successfully negotiated his surrender.

'The man was then arrested by police on suspicion of firearms offences and section 136 of the Mental Health Act.

'Officers were called to the property on Hall Cross Grove at 1.36pm this afternoon following concerns for a man's safety.

'At that stage the man had made threats to harm himself and claimed to be in possession of a firearm and explosive devices.

'The safety of the public is our top priority and it was necessary to close some roads in the area while the incident was ongoing.

'We are now pleased to have resolved this incident without any harm coming to anyone and I would like to thank local residents for their patience and support while we worked to bring this situation to a peaceful and safe resolution'.

Police carried out a detailed search of the property for explosive devices and firearms, but had yet to confirm whether they had found anything.

The drama centred on Hall Cross Grove, a small cul-de-sac, and officers were stationed all around the house.

Dozens of armed officers wearing full body armour arrived at approximately 1.30pm, and set up a cordon to keep the public safe. 

Kieran Carter, who lives just yards from the house at the centre of the drama, told the Huddersfield Daily Examiner while the siege was still ongoing: 'It's very surreal.

'I was out in the back garden, which backs on to Hall Cross Grove, tidying up some rubbish when all of a sudden the police were there.

'They told me they needed to use my garden to get through to a house and told me to go inside.

'There are three of them there at the minute: one with what looks like a machine-gun, another one with a dog and the third what looks like a grenade launcher.

'There's also a very big vehicle pulled up outside. It looks as though it is an armoured vehicle'.

'It's all very surreal. I know the guy who lives in the house and he keeps himself to himself'. 

A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police confirmed today that the man remained in custody and enquiries were ongoing.
