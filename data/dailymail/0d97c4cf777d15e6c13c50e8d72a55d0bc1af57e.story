When it’s bitterly cold outside and dark before 5pm, what could be more comforting than a mug of hot chocolate?

But which one should you choose? We enlisted the help of chocolate expert Jennifer Earle, a judge at the International Chocolate Awards who also runs Chocolate Ecstasy Tours, an events company that seeks out the best chocolate experiences. Here are her verdicts . . .

Montezuma’s Chilli Drinking Chocolate

£6.29 for 300g, montezuma.co.uk

Jennifer says: Chilli and chocolate go together like strawberries and cream. But while this has a generous hit of chocolate — 73 per cent — the chilli’s a little overpowering.

We say: So easy to make. At 189 calories per serving, it’s ideal for a snack-sized pick-me-up. 4/5

Hasslachers Hot Drinking Chocolate

£3.75 for 150g, Waitrose

Jennifer says: The real deal — 100 per cent quality Colombian cacao. You can drink it like an espresso or add milk and sugar. Absolutely my favourite.

We say: A faff to make. You put three cocoa discs per cup into a pan and heat gently until they melt then add milk. But it’s a low 150 calories per serving. 5/5

Cafe Direct Rich Hot Chocolate

£2 for 150g, Waitrose

Jennifer says: The rich aroma of top-quality Dominican Republic cocoa beans hits me before I’ve taken my first sip. There’s no added salt or other flavourings, a generous 40 per cent cocoa and only 162 calories per serving. But, disappointingly, the drink itself is grainy, a bit like a chocolate cup-a-soup.

We say: This won a Good Housekeeping food award last year. Simply mix three heaped teaspoons with a little milk and top up with hot milk. 3/5

Galaxy Instant Hot Chocolate

£2.60 for 370g, Sainsbury’s

Jennifer says: The label recommends using hot water rather than milk which means, at 80 calories, it’s diet-friendly. But it’s revolting — like drinking chocolate-flavoured water. It’s only got 3 per cent Galaxy chocolate, too, and is packed with additives and sweeteners.

We say: Although it promises a ‘silky smooth’ drink, the cup is full of powdery lumps. 1/5

Options Belgian Hot Chocolate Mint 

£2 for 220g, Asda 

Jennifer says: For a low calorie drink (38 calories per serving), it’s surprisingly satisfying. It tastes like restaurant mint chocolates — impressive as it’s only 20 per cent cocoa. You make it with water, but the added acacia gum gives it a nice creamy taste.

We say: We found it had a cloying taste. 2/5

Cadbury’s Drinking Chocolate

£1.50 for 250g, Asda

Jennifer says: I’ve loved Cadbury’s since childhood. But my taste buds are more sophisticated now, and with just 25 per cent cocoa and 165 calories per serving, the chocolate hit isn’t great here. But all those lovely memories make this nostalgia in a cup.

We say: Just add three heaped teaspoons to a cup of hot milk. But it’s very sweet.2/5

Charbonnel and Walker The Chocolate Drink

£4.99 for 300g, Waitrose

Jennifer says: The tiny flakes are made from a generous 51 per cent cocoa. No wonder it smells like a good-quality chocolate bar with the faintest hint of delicious vanilla.

I love the sophisticated tin, too. For the price it’s a real bargain, and at 193 calories per serving, it’s not too fattening either.

We say: It’s very hard to get the flakes to melt, but it’s worth it — the drink is delicious. 4/5

Hans Sloane Rich Dark Drinking Chocolate

£4.99 for 270g, Tesco

Jennifer says: I love the look of the dark chocolate beads. But although the 53 per cent cocoa content sounds generous, the beads are virtually 47 per cent sugar (along with a few other additives). It needs less sugar and more chocolate. Then it might be drinkable.

We say: You put three tablespoons of the chocolate beads into 200ml of hot milk and stir vigorously.

The beads take a long time to dissolve and, even after 60 seconds whisking, we’re left with lumps still in the chocolate. It’s disappointingly sweet and has a far too large number of calories (344 per serving). A couple of sips are enough. 2/5
