A convicted bank robber today became Britain's first prisoner to be given a paid apprenticeship - while still behind bars.

Reuben Reynolds, 30, was a member of a four-man gang which netted £250,000 using stolen pick-up trucks to rip ATM machines from the walls of shops and banks in a five-month spree.

He was jailed for four years at Lincoln Magistrates' Court in November 2009 after admitting one count of conspiracy to steal.

Reynolds will now work for housing firm The Gelder Group after being freed from his cell at HMP Lincoln to work five days a week as a £3.60-an-hour trainee builder.

But Reynolds, who is now studying an NVQ in maintenance, will continue o be monitored by the Prison Service and must sleep in his prison cell every night. Furthermore he cannot spend a penny of his earnings until he is released.

A spokesman for The Gelder Group said the apprenticeship will be cancelled if Reynolds steps out of line.

She said: 'He's a very lucky boy. He's determined to turn his life around and get back on the straight and narrow.

'He will be closely monitored by us and the Prison Service. He's got too much to lose if it goes wrong.

'He will be working on our new build house and insurance and renovations so homeowners will be told and have the choice to say no if they wish.

'But Reuben has already been working for free on work experience and no one has had any problems.'

The apprenticeship course includes painting and decorating, plastering and carpentry through the Sturton-by-Stow firm's new training academy.

Work release: Mr Reynolds had been jailed for four years in 2009, but has been freed on licence to work five days a week

He worked several weeks for free on work experience before being interviewed for the position and agreed terms on Friday.

During his crime spree Reynolds was part of a four-man gang that stole £250,000 from cash machines from shops and banks during a five-month spree in Lincolnshire. They also took cigarettes and tobacco and caused £13,000 damage. The gang is now serving a total of 16 years.

Reynolds is eligible for release later this year on licence after serving half of his sentence.

Mike Johnson, group training manager at The Gelder Group, said Reynolds is the first serving prisoner to get a paid apprenticeship in Britain.

He said: 'It is the first time ever it has been done and we're proud Gelder Group has been selected to pilot and manage it.

'Reuben is number one and hopefully there will be a lot more.

'We provide them with all the things they will need and help them prepare for when they are released.

'We want to give them the best chance to find employment. We want to help them get back into the community and get back on track.

'There is a stigma attached when you are a prisoner. Sometimes it's difficult to prove it's a one-off and they regret it for the rest of their lives.

'What we're trying to do with this scheme is show that there is value in taking on inmates and past prisoners.

'We are motivated by a passion for training people and getting them back into the community.'

Reynold's wages will be kept by the Prison Service until he is released.

The company is taking over a training facility at the prison and plans to extend the apprenticeship to 150 inmates by the end of the year.

Karl McCartney, MP for Lincoln, described the scheme as 'commendable'.

He said: 'This clearly is a milestone in the Gelder Group and the prison services' development programme.

'It is all the more commendable insofar as the Gelder Group, I gather, is the first company to take on a serving prisoner as an apprentice. So well done to all involved.'
