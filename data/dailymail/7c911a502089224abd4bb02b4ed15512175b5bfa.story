The trend for sheer skirts over full briefs continues to dominate the red carpet as Alex Burke and Tulisa showed at last night's MOBOs.

The look can be elegant and requires a pair of Bridget Jones knickers, a lace or mesh skirt, and ultra-toned upper thighs. It's certainly not for wallflowers.

Former Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld, who is in her seventh decade, rocked sheer at the launch of her CR Fashion Book Issue N.5 last month.

At the grand age of 60 the style guru pulled off flashing a generous amount of leg, showing that the trend can work for any age as long as you keeps yourself in good shape.

Most of the A-list guests followed her lead and bared their bottoms beneath evening couture at the party a couple of weeks ago at The Peninsula Paris. 

They included Cara Delevingne, Miranda Kerr and model Chiara Ferragni - who wore a brave barely-there dress over bra and pants. 

Ellie Goulding has worn the look in it's simplest, classic form - plain black underwear beneath a thick lace dress.

Miranda Kerr and Kim Kardashian went for different takes on the trend, with the former flaunting a deconstricted slip style, and the latter a super bold see-through armour  skirt with demi-cup PVC bra.

Julianne Hough managed to make the knicker-flashing trend beautiful and elegant in a show stopping pale mint number at the Emmys last autumn.

But would you dare show your smalls in public?
