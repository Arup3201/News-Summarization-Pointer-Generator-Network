A British mother driving in the Peking to Paris rally has been killed in an horrific head-on crash on a Siberian motorway. 

Emma Wilkinson, 47, died immediately when her 1970 Chevrolet C10 was hit by a Volkswagon Polo around 120 miles east of Tyumen. 

Her co-driver Peter Davies suffered minor injuries in the crash in which a man and child in the other vehicle also died.

Mr Davies tried to rescue the woman rally driver who died on the spot, reported The Siberian Times.

He was last night said to be 'shocked'.

In a statement from the rally drivers organisers, it read: Emma 'was a fun loving, lively and popular member of the rally.

'In the three weeks we've been together both she and Peter proved themselves to be capable, competent and resourceful. 

'Their
1970 Chevrolet C10 pickup was a remarkable sight in the the Mongolian 
wilderness and today our thoughts and sympathies are with Emma's family 
and friends including her two brothers Robert and Mark who are also with
us.'

The statement added: 'The Rally 
Office are working with the Local Police, the Foreign Office and the 
British Embassy to offer the family whatever assistance is needed at 
this difficult time.'

Nikolai Sinegubov, a Russian rally participant in the rally, said: 'Her co-driver Peter Davies is in a state on an utter shock, as we all are. 

The Peking to Paris race is one of the longest and toughest challenges undertaken in a classic car. 

The first race took place in 1907 and was entirely off road without maps, rules, passports or garages.

Competitors were all vying for the prize - a magnum of champagne and the glory. The route starts in Beijing and hits Ulaan Baatar, Novosibirsk, Kiev, Krakow, Bratislava, Salzburg, Gstaad and ParisThe idea for the race came from a challenge published in the Paris newspaper Le Matin on 31 January 1907, which read: 'What needs to be proved today is that as long as a man has a car, he can do anything and go anywhere.

'Is there anyone who will undertake to travel this summer from Peking to Paris by automobile?'

'He was helping pull the cars away from each other in order to pull her out because she was stuck inside after the head-on crash.'

'The ambulance and the traffic police came very fast, and everyone rushed to help.'

The Russian said: 'She was driving when suddenly a Volkswagen car swayed off its lane and smashed right into their car. 

'It was going at high speed, and one theory is the driver fell asleep. 

'They were driving a Chevrolet C10 1970 which is a big, easy to see car.'

A Russian police spokesman confirmed: 'The driver of the Chevrolet car, a 46-year-old female resident of Great Britain, died.'

The Peking to Paris rally, starting at the Great Wall of China, is billed as the longest and toughest race anyone can drive in a vintage or classic car.

Participants crossed from Mongolia into Siberia earlier this week on the epic 9,317 mile odyssey from China to France.
