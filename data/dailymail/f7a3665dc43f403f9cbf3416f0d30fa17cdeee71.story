A grandmother has been charged with drug smuggling after police found 55 rocks of crack hidden in her privates.

Berenice Fernandes, 74, claimed she knew nothing about the stash of drugs and said her granddaughter must have hidden them on her while she was sleeping.

A female police officer discovered a plastic bag containing the rocks of crack cocaine stashed in Fernandes' vagina after officers arrested the pensioner and her 33-year-old granddaughter Glaucia Bispo in Salvador, Brazil.

Police in Salvador said officers from the force's drugs squad had been monitoring Fernandes and Bispo, who they suspected were behind a surge in drug dealing in the Boca do Rio area of the city in north east Brazil.

Officers were called to the grandmother's house on Friday night after neighbours complained about noise coming from a raucous party at the property.

Fernandes and Bispo were stopped as they tried to leave the house and searched by a female officer, who discovered the stash of rocks wrapped in a plastic bag in the grandmother's privates.

The women were also found to be carrying the equivalent of Â£40 in cash - believed to be proceeds of drug deals at the party.

Both women were arrested and charged with drug smuggling.
