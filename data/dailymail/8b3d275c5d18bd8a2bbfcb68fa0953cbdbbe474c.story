First there was a prime spot in last month’s Diamond Jubilee river pageant. Then came her giggling appearance alongside Prince Philip at Royal Ascot.

And yesterday, Carole Middleton completed a transformation perhaps even more remarkable than her daughter’s, as she took her place in the Royal Box at Wimbledon for the first time.

The enviable hat trick shows how warmly the Duchess of Cambridge’s family has been welcomed into the fold.

While there weren’t any royals present for Mrs Middleton and her husband Michael to chat to yesterday, the couple were still clearly enjoying the view from SW19’s most coveted spot.

And it was quite a step up from the 55-year-old’s last visit to Centre Court, only six days previously.

The former British Airways stewardess had settled for the cheap seats while her daughter’s in-laws, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, joked with Sir Bruce Forsyth in the Royal Box above.

It means the whole clan has now graced the famous box. Kate’s siblings, James and Pippa, made their debut there last week.

That's quite an upgrade: After slumming it in 'normal' seats last week, Mrs Middleton enjoyed an improved view

Her visit comes after another day of intermittent rain with forecasters warning of more showers for the rest of the week.

However, there could be hope yet for drier, warmer climes to grace the British Isles - just in time for the Olympics.

After weeks of unpredictable storms, torrential rain and high winds, more settled weather could be on the horizon. But it will two more weeks before the country can enjoy it.

Britain is set to endure a continued run of chaotic weather until the middle of July, according to the Met Office. Today the covers stayed on at Wimbledon during a spell of heavy rainfall, frustrating Andy Murray and other competitors whose matches were interrupted yesterday.

However, Murray went on to win in style after the match resumed.

Forecasters
say a drier, warmer spell is expected for the last two weeks of the 
month, bringing hope of a sunnier outlook as the Olympics begins on July
27.

A spokesman for the Met
Office said: 'There's going to be no great change at the moment. It's 
going to be much the same for the next couple of weeks, some dry days 
and also some days with showers.

'However,
we are looking at a break in the third week. There are signs of some 
more settled, drier weather for the last two weeks of July.'

'Rainfall amounts are likely to be 
near or slightly below average for July, with the best chance of dry 
weather probably later on.

'Temperatures will probably be near 
or above average across the UK, with northern and western parts possibly
faring best compared to regional averages.

'Any warm or very warm days are more 
likely to come later in July rather than mid-month. Sunshine amounts are
likely to be around average.'

Opera star Katherine Jenkins and Mollie King, from the girl group The Saturdays, were also spotted in the crowd on centre court.

Unsettled
conditions, including scattered showers, will persist until the end of 
the weekend. At times the showers will be heavy with a risk of thunder 
and some areas will see more persistent rain. Temperatures will continue
at around average, or a bit below.

The
worst of the bad weather is expected to affect the north and north west
of the country and any improvements are likely to be seen in the south 
and south east.

A Met Office spokesman added: 'There
are always uncertainties at this forecast range, but there are signs of
some more settled weather, especially towards the end of the period.

This
week the Met Office revealed that June had been the wettest since 
records began, with double the average rain falling during the month.

Provisional figures showed the UK 
received 145.3mm (5.7 inches) during June, beating the previous record 
of 136.2mm (5.4 inches) seen in June 2007 - and more than double the 
average for June of 64.9mm (2.5 inches).

It
is the second month this year to see record-breaking amounts of rain, 
after this April became the wettest in the records dating back more than
a century to 1910.

Prolonged
rainfall and short - but exceptionally heavy showers - blighted the 
month of June and ended with freak storms that battered areas of the 
Midlands and the North East.

The heavy rain caused flooding in Wales and other parts of England.

Last month was also the one of the dullest Junes on record, with 
just 119.2 hours sunshine - only slightly less miserable than June 1987, 
when a record low of 115.4 hours was recorded.

Rain has blighted Wimbledon for another year, causing major delays to play

Wimbledon is just one of a number of major events affected by wet weather, including Ascot and the Jubilee

And the UK has experienced the coolest June since 1991, with average temperatures of 12.3C (54F).

A Met Office spokesman said: 'Movements in the track of the jet stream, a narrow band of fast-flowing
westerly winds high in the atmosphere, have contributed to the weather 
we have seen.'

The past three months have seen lots of wet weather, with the period 
April to June also the wettest on record for the time of year. Only the 
second half of May saw a spell of prolonged fine weather.

Wales and Northern Ireland had their wettest June on record, England 
experienced the second wettest and even in Scotland - where the far 
north west was remarkably dry - it was the eighth wettest June in the 
records.

Visitors to the Cotswold Show in Gloucester had to put up with the unseasonal conditions for June

Many areas saw extremely high rainfall, with 83 out of 237 observation sites seeing records for rain broken.

The wet weather has affected a number of major events on Britain's summer calendar.

The Henley Royal Regatta, Royal Ascot, the Royal Jubilee and the Isle of Wight Festival have all been a washout.

And
staff at Wimbledon have been kept busy pulling rain covers over outside
courts as showers have affected play on a number of days.
