A blundering Indian groom was dumped at the altar by his bride-to-be after he failed to solve a simple maths problem.

The woman walked out of the ceremony after her would-be husband revealed his appalling arithmetic skills moments before they said 'I do.'

She had asked him to add up 15 + 6 and he wrongly replied that the answer was 17.

'The groom's family kept us in the dark about his poor education,' said Mohar Singh, the bride's father.

'Even a first grader can answer this.' 

Most marriages in India are arranged by the families of the bride and groom. 

Except for brief meetings, the couple rarely gets to know each other before the nuptials.

The incident took place in the village of Rasoolabad village near the industrial town of Kanpur in northern Uttar Pradesh state on Wednesday, local police officer Rakesh Kumar said.

The groom's family tried persuading the woman to return, but she refused. 

She claimed the groom had misled them about his education.

Local police were called in to mediate between the families and both sides returned all the gifts and jewelry that had been exchanged before the wedding, Kumar said.

Last month, another bride in Uttar Pradesh married a wedding guest after her groom-to-be had a seizure and collapsed at the wedding venue.

Groom Jugal Kishore was just about to exchange vows when he collapsed with a seizure and was rushed to hospital.

Angry that she had not been informed of his condition, the 23-year-old bride, Indira, asked a member of her brother-in-law's family, Harpal Singh, to marry her instead. 

Mr Singh, who was wearing jeans and a leather jacket, was caught off guard, but agreed to go ahead with the wedding.

After the ceremony, Mr Kishore returned to the venue after being treated in hospital to find that his fiancee had married someone else, it was reported by The Times of India.
