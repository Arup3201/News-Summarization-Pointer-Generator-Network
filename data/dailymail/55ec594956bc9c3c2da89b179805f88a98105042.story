One lucky buyer will have the chance to take home the mixtape taken to the moon by the astronauts on Apollo 14 when it goes under the hammer later this month.

The well-travelled cassette, which contains classics from the likes of the Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, Marvin Gaye, and Credence Clearwater Revival, is just one space artefact up for auction from November 21.

Apollo 14 was the eighth mission manned lunar mission and the tape would have been grooved along to by Commander Alan Shepard, Command Module Pilot Stuart Roosa, and Lunar Module Pilot Edgar Mitchell.

It is one of 600 lots on offer from the Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 moon missions by online auctions site RRAuction, who specialise in collectables.

Other artefacts on offer include an American flag flown to the moon on Apollo 11, and a Mexican flag flown to the surface of the moon on Apollo 16.

But the prize lot is a rare lunar surface cuff checklist, worn on the outside of Apollo 15 mission commander Dave Scott’s spacesuit for over six hours as he and Jim Irwin explored the moon’s surface over 41 years ago.

'Apollo lunar surface EVA artefacts are the rarest and most desirable of all flown space memorabilia,' said Bobby Livingston, Vice President, Sales & Marketing for RRAuction.

'Rarely offered for sale, most cuff checklists reside in museums or in the private space collections of the moonwalkers themselves, and we are proud to be able to offer it to the public at our fourth Space and Aviation Autograph and Artifact Auction.

'This is truly one of the rarest space artefacts available, and collector and institutional interest is bound to be intense.'

But is it past its use by date? Absolutely unique freeze-dried 'space food' created for use during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo missions

Robert Pearlman, editor of collectSPACE.com, a magazine for space history enthusiasts, said: 'When it comes to space artefact collecting, the holy grails of the hobby are items that have not just been to the moon, nor just those landed on its surface, but those actually used out on the moon's surface during the astronauts' historic moon walks.

'There just aren't that many artefacts that fall into that very limited category that are not already in museums. This cuff checklist is one such item – and it is an amazing one at that.'

Apollo 15 was the ninth manned lunar mission in the Apollo space program, and considered at the time the most successful manned space flight up to that moment because of its long duration and greater emphasis on scientific exploration than had been possible on previous missions.

Commander Scott’s cuff checklist was a critical piece of hardware which contributed to the mission’s success, the auctioneers said in a statement.

'Clearly visible in multiple iconic photos taken of and captured by the astronauts while on the moon, the cuff checklist is literally the step-by-step instructions for how Scott and Irwin would explore their landing site,' Mr Pearlman added.

'Apollo 15 commander David Scott's cuff checklist is of particular historical note given what his mission accomplished. Not only did they explore the lunar highlands, but Scott and lunar module pilot James Irwin rode the first lunar roving vehicle (LRV), the first car driven on a world other than Earth.'

Other lots include flown Robbins medallions from many historic flights, including the exceedingly rare and in demand Apollo 17 exemplar; and many rare and unique signed photographs and manuscripts, including a wonderful Apollo 11 'first step' photo signed by Neil Armstrong, as well as the most creative handwritten description of the moon by moonwalker Jim Irwin who presents our heavenly neighbor as a real estate listing.
