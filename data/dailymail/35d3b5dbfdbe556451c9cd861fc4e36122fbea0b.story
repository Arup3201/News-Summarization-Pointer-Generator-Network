Miley Cyrus stole the show at this year's VMAs but instead of twerking and sticking out her tongue, the pop star grabbed the attention of the audience by promoting her pet cause - youth homelessness.

The blonde singer won the Video of the Year award for her song Wrecking Ball but rather than take to the stage and mouth platitudes, Cyrus sent in her stead a young man named Jesse to read a speech about the subject close to the star's heart.

'My name is Jesse,' the 22-year-old said. 'I am accepting this award on behalf of the 1.6 million runaways and homeless youth in the United States who are starving and lost and scared for their lives. I know, because I am one of those people.'

Emotional: Cyrus watched tearfully from the stars' enclosure alongside Sam Smith and Katy Perry as the young man briefly described his experiences as a homeless youth in Los Angeles

'I've been an extra in your movies, I've been an extra in your lives,' the blond-haired, blue eyed Jesse told the audience. 'Los Angeles has the largest population of homeless youth in America.'

Cyrus sat, tearfully, in the audience next to singer Sam Smith as Jesse went on: 'Though may have been invisible to you on the streets I have a lot of the same dreams that brought many of you here tonight.'

Star: Her decision to have Jesse accept her video of the year award made her the star of this year's show for a much different reason from last year, when her twerking routine shocked many viewers

Throughout the speech Jesse, who the New York Times says is originally from Oregon, revealed no more about himself than his first name and past as a homeless youth. At one stage host Jimmy Fallon steadied Jesse's hand on the microphone.

He concluded his speech by directing those interested in learning more to Cyrus's Facebook page, which the pop sensation had updated with a video explaining to fans how to donate to homeless charity My Friend's Place.

The executive director of My Friend's Place, Heather Carmichael, revealed to the New York Times that Jesse had in the past received 
help from the organisation.

Cyrus paid a visit to their shelter on Tuesday, which is when Miss Carmichael says she first met Jesse. 

In the video, Cyrus assures viewers her decision was motivated by a desire to help, not just whip up publicity for herself.

Last year's VMAs saw Miley twerk up a media storm with her routine alongside Robin Thicke

My Friend’s Place had its beginnings in 1988 when Steve LePore and Craig Scholz began distributing lunches to homeless youngsters in Hollywood.

Two years later, they opened a facility they called My Friend’s Place in Hollywood where they offered practical help to young people aged 12 to 25.

The privately funded charity aims to make the homeless youngsters self-sufficient and today helps more than 1,700 of them with education, health and job assistance.

'Now is just the beginning for me,' she said, suddenly branding herself an anti youth homelessness crusader. 'We gotta start somewhere.' 

Along with the video was a message detailing how her fans can support My Friend's Place via a donation drive she's created on the site Prizeo.

'For every $5 donation, you’ll be entered to win a trip for 2 to Brazil to hang out with me at my show in Rio de Janeiro,' reads the message.

Cyrus's Instagram feed was also soon updated with photos of her and Jesse, as they rode to the awards show together and posed in a photo booth backstage.

The Times reports that they stopped off at fast food joint In-N-Out burger after the show.
