Michael Gove said the King James Bible is 'has helped shape and define the English language'

The Education Secretary has run into his second public funding row in a week after he was today forced to deny that his plan to send every school in Britain a copy of the King James Bible - at a cost of £377,000 - has run into trouble over funding.

The Prime Minister had reportedly told Michael Gove that while he supported the idea, he should avoid using taxpayers' money, according to sources.

It follows Mr Gove's suggestion that a replacement for the Royal Yacht Britannia should be commissioned using taxpayers' money to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.

The Education Secretary 
has yet to find a private sponsor for his project, with some 
Whitehall sources reported as saying he has been told he cannot 
distribute the book until he does so.

But Mr Gove said talks were under way 
with a number of individuals and organisations that might 'share some of
 the burden' - but the taxpayer would underwrite the cost.

'The taxpayer is there to underwrite 
the costs but we are in conversation with a number of individuals and 
organisations that may share some of the burden,' he said.

Mr Gove said the Bible was the most 'important book written in the English language' and had major cultural and historical significance.

He said a 'low cost' deal had been struck with the publisher to provide the Bible - a move he described as a 'powerful and potent' way of highlighting the historical significance of the anniversary.

The Bibles will be sent out to more than 20,000 schools to mark the 400th anniversary of it translation.

It has been claimed thousands of copies may already have been printed and will be left in a warehouse without the funding, but Department for Education said it did not know if the copies had yet been printed, or where the copies might currently be stored.

And they said the aim was to distribute the Bibles to schools at Easter, so the timetable had not been affected by the lack of a sponsor and they would be distributed even if no sponsor is found.

A senior education department source told the Guardian enough public money was available for the scheme to go ahead, but No 10 had merely indicated that 'sponsorship was desirable'.

But Whitehall sources said Mr Gove was told that it would be wrong to spend nearly £400,000 on the project at a time when the government was in negotiations with teaching unions over cuts to their pensions.

Mr Gove's plan would see 20,000 schools receive a copy of the King James Bible

A Department for Education official said in a statement: 'The Prime Minister was clear in his speech in December about the importance of the King James Bible, and marking this important anniversary.

‘The Prime Minister supports the plan to send a copy to every school. We continue to seek philanthropic sponsorship.'

The third official translation of the
 Bible into English, also known as the Authorised Version, was 
commissioned by the Protestant King James I in 1604.

It was completed by 54 scholars 
working on Hebrew and Greek manuscripts in Oxford, Cambridge and 
Westminster. It became the official version used by the Church of 
England and was spread around the world along with the British Empire.

But its popularity has also endured 
because of the poetry and the majesty of its language, with many of its 
original phrases entering popular conversation. Among the most famous coinages in its 66 books are 'the powers that be', 'the apple of his eye' and 'the writing on the wall'.

Mr Gove said: ‘It‘s a thing of beauty, and it‘s also an incredibly important historical artefact. It has helped shape and define the English language and is one of the keystones of our shared culture. And it is a work that has had international significance’.

The 400th anniversary of the publication of the Bible was in 2011.In a speech in December, Mr Cameron celebrated the importance of the King James Bible giving three reasons for its relevance.

He said: 'The King James Bible has bequeathed a body of language that permeates every aspect of our culture and heritage.

'Second, just as our language and culture is steeped in the Bible, so too is our politics.

'Third,
 we are a Christian country. And we should not be afraid to say so. Let 
me be clear: I am not in any way saying that to have another faith – or 
no faith – is somehow wrong.'

Government ministers have always been careful to avoid controversies surrounding religion with Tony Blair's former communications chief Alastair Campbell famously once declaring: 'We don't do God'.

But Mr Gove said: 'It's a thing of beauty, and it's also an incredibly important historical artefact. It has helped shape and define the English language and is one of the keystones of our shared culture. And it is a work that has had international significance'.

When the scheme was announced the National Secular Society suggested that the Department for Education could put a message on its website and save 'tens of thousands of pounds'.

NSS president Terry Sanderson said: 'It's not as if Bibles are in short supply in schools. But if Mr Gove intends to go ahead with this, will he also please ensure that a copy of On the Origin of Species is sent out on Darwin Day?

'This book is much harder to find in schools and would be in line with his policy of promoting science and evidence-based education. I'm sure that he could write an excellent foreword to this too.'

Richy Thompson, campaigns officer at the British Humanist Association, added: 'Either the Government is funding this initiative itself at a time when it is making severe cuts elsewhere, or the Church is finding it but using the Government as a vehicle through which to promote Christianity - both are unacceptable.'
