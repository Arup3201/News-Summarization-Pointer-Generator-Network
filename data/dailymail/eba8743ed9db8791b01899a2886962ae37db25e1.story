The owner of a tiny B&B in the Outer Hebrides has dropped his landmark action against the world’s largest travel website.

Richard Gollin feared he would rack up thousands of pounds in legal bills if he pursued the case against internet giant Tripadvisor.

Mr Gollin, 64, launched his historic claim after guests cancelled their bookings on the strength of reviews posted on the website.

Case dropped: Richard Gollin, Hebridean guesthouse owner in Scotland, who started legal proceedings against Tripadvisor

Disgruntled guests claimed rooms were dirty or cold, and described their host variously as ‘pompous, arrogant and incredibly rude’.

While Mr Gollin accepted genuine criticism, he claimed that some of the reviews were ‘malicious and factually inaccurate’.

And because the US-owned website refused to remove them, his business was affected and he lost income.

Last month Mr Gollin, who runs the eight-bedroom Baile-na-Cille guesthouse at Uig on the Isle of Lewis, began proceedings to sue the organisation, worth around £3billion, for a £2,000 loss.

He had initially scored a small victory by winning the right to have the case heard in Scotland, instead of under American law as Tripadvisor wished.

TripAdvisor’s solicitor Angus MacDonald originally wanted the case dealt
with under American law but eventually agreed it should be heard at 
Stornoway Sheriff Court.

He successfully argued it was 'so complex in nature' that it could only be dealt with by the ordinary sheriff court.

But Mr Gollin opposed the move - saying it was a tactic by TripAdvisor to rack up legal costs to a level he could not afford.

But yesterday his solicitor, Duncan Burd, confirmed the action had been dropped.

He said: ‘Mr Gollin has decided not to pursue it further because of the cost implications. It could have cost thousands.’

'We had conversations and an email from The Sheriff Principal’s office which made it clear that he did not accept the appeal because he considered the action live in the ordinary court. 

'The only alternative to appeal that decision was a very complex procedure with massive expense.'

The lawyer insisted that Mr Gollin had been a trailblazer over this - and not least for many others - and has certainly made his point.

Sheriff Colin Scott Mackenzie admitted he had 'some sympathy' for Mr Gollin over the time the claim had been in the system - over six months.

Although disappointed at being forced to back down, the guesthouse owner believes it will open a floodgate of cases against TripAdvisor.

He revealed that he had received over 500 emails, phone calls and letters of support from people - and all but two in favour of his action.

He said: 'A tiny restaurant told me that they had a bad review posted in February and it had not even opened.

'I have even had a bad review posted last month which was clearly a fake and claimed that my wife liked a drink was particularly upsetting as she is a pilot. TripAdvisor has now withdrawn that review - but not the reviews of the review.'

He now hopes that TripAdvisor victims stand up against false or malicious comments that render reviews untrustworthy - yet have the power to drive hoteliers and B&B proprietors out of business.
