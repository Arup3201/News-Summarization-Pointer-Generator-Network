The former Radio 1 DJ behind the ‘Ukip Calypso’ has denied it is racist – because some of his friends are from the Caribbean.

Mike Read said the Ukip anthem, sung in a Jamaican-accent warning of ‘illegal immigrants in every town’, was just ‘a bit of fun’.

He said: ‘I don't have a racist bone in my body. I work across all cultures and creeds, I travel the world.’ Mr Read added: I’ve got so many chums out in the Caribbean. I’ve spent a lot of time out there.’

Mr Read has launched a bid for chart success with a song singing the praises of Ukip and its leader Nigel Farage

Mr Read said he felt ‘absolutely terrible’ that people might be offended. He told BBC London: ‘I thought oh my god, that's not what I intended at all, I felt absolutely so low I cannot tell you.

‘People are very very very quick to take offence now at something that years ago would have been deemed to be a bit of satire and a bit of fun.

‘But now with social media everybody can assume that you meant something appalling by it, which of course I didn’t. I was terribly hurt that people thought that.'

The Radio Berkshire added: ‘At the time it was a bit of fun, and that’s how you sing calypso. Looking back on it, maybe I shouldn’t have done it like that, I should maybe sung it straight or whatever, but it was just meant to be a bit of fun, and the fact that people are taking it like that is abhorrent to me.

‘In hindsight maybe I should have done it in a straight accent or who knows?’

But Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who has called for the song to go to Number 1 in the charts, dismissed claims it was racist.

Mr Read's song has sparked accusations of racism for using a mock Jamaican accent

The song raises the issue of immigration with the lyrics: ‘Leaders committed a cardinal sin, open the borders let them all come in'

He said: "No, of course it’s not [racist]. Mike Reid has worked for the BBC for several decades, he’s in fact one of your corporation’s great stars, and he’s made a calypso song, and he said himself if he was doing a Bob Dylan song, he’d do Bob Dylan’s accent. It is meant to be a bit of fun."

The song raises the issue of immigration with the lyrics: ‘Leaders committed a cardinal sin, open the borders let them all come in, illegal immigrants in every town, stand up and be counted Blair and Brown.’

It continues: ‘Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again – when Nigel is at No 10.’

Other lyrics include digs at the European Union such as ‘With the EU we must be on our mettle, want to change our lawnmowers and our kettles. The EU live in wonderland, tried to ban bent bananas and British jam, we don't want jam the EU way, jam yesterday tomorrow but never today.’

Mr Read, a former Conservative supporter, also warns against trusting the Prime Minister, singing: ‘The British people have been let down, that's why Ukip is making ground. From Crewe to Cleethorpes, from Hull to Hendon, they don't believe Cameron's referendum.

‘The other parties will count the cost, in Eastleigh, Thanet, Thurrock and Boston, Labour and Tories shaking in their boots when Ukip kick them up the grass roots.’

The song also mentions Mr Farage’s love of ‘fags and beer’ and jokes about the frequency of his appearances on the BBC’s Question Time.

Ukip’s Commonwealth spokesman Winston McKenzie defended the song. Appearing on Newsnight last night he said: ‘Ever since the beginning of time – the Beatles, Elvis, the Rolling Stones – they have taken off the black man.

‘What he has done is fantastic and the PC brigade have to grow up and get with it. The guy has made a song.’

Mr Read, who currently hosts an afternoon show on BBC Berkshire, spent more than a decade at Radio 1.

He hit the headlines in 1984 when he refused to play the Frankie Goes to Hollywood single, Relax, because he objected to its lyrics.

A BBC spokeswoman said Mr Read had not breached the corporation's guidelines on impartiality by recording the song in support of the anti-EU party because he did not present a current affairs programme.

The corporation added that the decision on whether to play the song was up to the discretion of individual programme producers. A BBC Radio 1 spokesman declined to comment on whether it would be played on if it enters the Top 40.

He said: ‘The song is not currently on our playlist and, as the chart is compiled at the end of the week, we cannot say what will be in the Official Chart on Sunday.’

The song, which is being sold for 79p, yesterday reached as high as number 15 on the iTunes chart – but was back down to number 15 today.

Some bookmakers put the track at 50-1 to go straight into the charts at Number 1 on Sunday.

Mr Farage posted on Twitter: ‘Help get the UKIP Calypso by The Independents to Number 1.’

The song had mixed reviews on Amazon. One wrote: ‘My god, the musical equivalent of the Ebola virus. Anyway, isn't calypso music a bit foreign for Ukip?’

Another review said: ‘A triumph. What a blend of cultures, using a Jamaican style to highlight some very British issues, and I would never have guessed the signer wasn't a native of the Caribbean but top pop DJ Mike Read.’

A further comment said: ‘John, Paul, George, Ringo, Farage.’

Some criticised Mr Read’s accent on the song. One wrote: ‘Surely we should have moved on from white men singing in funny accents? I found this song a sad reflection of a sick society.’

‘Pretty sick with faux Jamaican accent. Shows UKIP in its true light as a nasty racist party,’ added another.

In May, Ukip had to cancel a ‘carnival of colour’ with a steel band in Croydon after it descended into farce.

The event was supposed to demonstrate the party welcomed members from all ethnic minorities, but rows broke out between supporters and demonstrators.

The steel band stopped playing and packed up after they found out the event was in support of the party.

Taxpayers’ money where does it go? Not even George Osborne knows, when we're in power and we engage, there will be no tax on the minimum wage.

Leaders committed a cardinal sin, open the borders let them all come in, illegal immigrants in every town, stand up and be counted Blair and Brown.

Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10.

The British people have been let down, that’s why Ukip is making ground, from Crewe to Cleethorpes, outer Hendon, they don't believe Cameron's referendum.

Coalition could be a fact, with any party we could make a pact, stop telling lies about us do, and we’ll stop telling the truth about you.

Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10.

Though our pensions scheme is in a mess, we need money for the NHS, to Jean-Cleade Juncker we’re giving away £55m a day.

Oh what a farce he won the vote, this is my favourite Juncker quote, he looked a reporter straight in the eye and said “when things get serious it's time to lie”.

Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10.

The EU live in wonderland, tried to ban bent bananas and British jam, we don't want jam the EU way, jam yesterday tomorrow but never today

The daily polls suggest somehow, Ukip are the third party now, in the euro elections we were so immersed, we weren't the third party we were the first

Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10.

With the government sitting on the fence, Ukip policy makes more sense, to get out of Europe is our target, Commonwealth not common market.

Other parties please take note, Ukip is not a protest vote, so mark your cross and by word of mouth, tell them what to do in Thanet South.

Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10.

With the EU we must be on our mettle, want to change our lawnmowers and our kettles, our hairdryers, smart phones and vacuum cleaners, but Ukip is wise to their misdemeanours.

Farage likes his fags and beer, but there is one thing I want to get clear, now I like Nigel, he’s a friend of mine, but he appears more than Dimbleby on Question Time.

Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10.

The other parties will count the cost, in Eastleigh, Thanet, Thurrock and Boston, Labour and Tories shaking in their boots when Ukip kick them up the grass roots.

Meanwhile down at Clacton-on-Sea, Ukip are making history, Douglas Carswell, we're quite adamant, will be the first MP in parliament.

Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10.
