England have called up spinners Scott Borthwick and James Tredwell to their Ashes Test squad following the retirement of Graeme Swann.

Uncapped leg-spinner Borthwick will be available, alongside slow left-armer Monty Panesar, for the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne.

Tredwell, who has played just one Test - more than three years ago in Bangladesh - will also report to Melbourne but not in time to figure in the fourth Test.

Warne to do it? Durham leg-spinner Scott Borthwick was given tips by Aussie legend Shane before the third Test in Adelaide and will now join the England squad for the final two Ashes Tests in Melbourne and Sydney

England have already lost the Ashes, conceding an unassailable 3-0 lead to their hosts after a third successive wide-margin defeat in Perth last week.

It is highly unlikely that two spinners would be considered at the MCG, but possible for the final Test in Sydney.

Spin there, done that: Although not a Test regular, Tredwell was part of England's ICC Champions Trophy squad last summer but his first and last Test appearance to date was against Bangladesh three years ago (L)

An England and Wales Cricket Board press release read: 'Borthwick will arrive into Melbourne later today, will train with England...and will be available for selection for the (fourth) Test, beginning on Boxing Day.

'Tredwell will arrive in Melbourne during the fourth Test and will be available for selection for the final Test in Sydney beginning on January 3.'

Panesar remains the likeliest replacement for Swann in the first instance, for the final two matches of what has been a tough series for England.
