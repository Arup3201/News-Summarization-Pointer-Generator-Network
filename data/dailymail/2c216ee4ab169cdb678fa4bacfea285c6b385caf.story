Shane Warne has denied spending four hours in millionaire businesswoman Michelle Mone’s hotel room – hours after a Valentine’s Day weekend with Liz Hurley.

The 44-year-old former Australia leg-spinner, who split from the actress last year, reportedly met up with Mone at her suite in London’s Dorchester Hotel on February 16.

But on Sunday he tweeted: 'Just read some more ludicrous & laughable reporting on me, what an absolute load of rubbish!Whatever, time to rack up the air miles again'.

However, it seems those reports have hurt him less than a paintballing session on Monday.

Warne posted a picture on Twitter of his battered and bruised body with the message: 'OUCH !!! This was fun back in Melbourne, but bloody hurt more than being hit by a fast bowler......'

Judging from the snap, Warne may have been better off facing a quick bowler, such as his compatriot Mitchell Johnson or South African Dale Steyn.

Instead, he showed his torso on the social networking site and it was reminiscent of Brian Close's body after the England batsman faced a barrage of bouncers from the West Indies pace attack of the 1970s.

On Valentine's Day, Warne had flown to the UK where he visited his ex-fiancee Hurley at the £6million 
Herefordshire mansion they bought in 2012.

Warne and Hurley spent the night there before travelling to London and spending a second night together at her townhouse.

They
 were believed to be trying to rekindle their relationship, with Warne 
recently hinting they were on the verge of a reconciliation.

But
 the Australian is said to have visited Mone, 42, at lunchtime the 
following day, apparently taking champagne and roses to her £500-a-night
 eighth-floor suite.

The 
pair emerged separately four hours later, with the underwear firm boss 
heading to the BBC’s central London office to appear on Radio 5 Live 
show, On The Money.

Mone, 
who divorced ex-husband Michael in January last year, flew back to 
Scotland the next day, while Warne jetted to Las Vegas to take part in a
 poker tournament.

Warne
 is not the first sportsman to be linked to Mone. In 2012 married 
footballer Robbie Savage was seen leaving her home in the early hours 
following an award ceremony earlier that evening. The pair claimed they 
are just friends.

On her Twitter page on Sunday night, Mone said she would never ‘meet a guy if he was taken’.

The
 businesswoman tweeted: ‘Thanks for all your messages, most lovely but 
for the rest of you, FTR [for the record] I’d never ever meet a guy if 
he was taken. It was done to me and I remember that pain.’

She
 added: ‘Not that it’s anyone’s biz but I’ve been single for 18 months, 
very independent, successful and don’t need anyone for anything other 
than my family.’
