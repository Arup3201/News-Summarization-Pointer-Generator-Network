You know the moment all too well — and dread it. Just as you’re getting a modicum of comfort on a flight, the seat in front suddenly pushes back, depriving you of valuable inches of legroom.

All you can do is to glower in a silent rage at the head of the other passenger, who has decided that by reclining his seat, his comfort is more important than ours.

However, some passengers have decided to get even rather than mad, by investing £13 in a gizmo called a Knee Defender, which its manufacturer claims is as ‘devious as it is ingenious’.

The Knee defender, pictured, consists of two small plastic clips which prevent the seat in front reclining 

The Knee Defender consists of two small pieces of plastic which clip the arms of your fold-down table, and prevent the passenger in front from pushing his seat back.

The device is adjustable — the closer the plastic clips are placed to the back of the seat, the less the seat will be able to move. It was invented by one Ira Goldman from Washington who, at 6ft 4in, was fed up with being ‘bashed in the knees over and over again’ when flying.

To keep tempers from fraying, the gadget comes with a ‘courtesy card’, which you hand to the passenger in front explaining why you are using the clips, and how many inches you are willing to allow him to recline.

The card instructs him to address any complaints to the airline in a bid to convince them to ‘provide enough space between rows so that people can recline without banging into other passengers’.

Unsurprisingly, the Knee Defender has become the cause of a few inflight rows.

Just this week, a United Airlines flight from Newark to Denver had to be diverted because of a barnstorming contretemps between two passengers.

During the flight, a woman in the middle of Row 11 tried to recline, but found she couldn’t. When it emerged that the man in the seat behind had attached a Knee Defender, she summoned a cabin attendant who asked the man to remove it.

He refused, and stated that if the woman reclined, then he would no longer be able to work on his laptop. After that, the situation escalated. The woman then threw a glass of water in the man’s face, and an all-out fight nearly ensued.

Fearing for the safety of the aircraft, the captain diverted to Chicago, where the two passengers were hoofed off.

Reclining has long been one of the most contentious issues regarding inflight etiquette. Surveys have found that 60 per cent of cabin crew have witnessed arguments sparked by the lowering of a seat-back — and nine out of ten passengers think reclining seats should be banned on shorter flights.

On the business networking site LinkedIn there has been a campaign to make airlines remove reclinable seats on short-haul journeys, so that passengers can get on with their work on laptops and make the most of the small amount of space they do have. One businessman even writes to say that he always offers the person in front of him $20 not to recline, and thereby guarantees that his space won’t be invaded.

Earlier this summer, Luton-based Monarch airlines, which flies to holiday destinations around Europe and the Mediterranean — its longest flight is to Egypt, five hours away — bowed to popular demand.

It said it was scrapping reclining seats throughout its entire fleet. Six of its Airbuses now have seats which cannot be reclined, and another 11 are due to be ‘upgraded’ by the end of the summer.

Other budget airlines have ditched reclining seats in recent years, but this is unlikely to happen on long-haul flights because passengers accept that most of us need them to rest or sleep during a ten-hour stretch.

The device is not currently outlawed by airline authorities but its use is controversial as it causes rows 

It is those who recline on short hops who are considered the real pariahs of the air, which is where the Knee Defender comes in.

Although the device is not outlawed by aviation authorities, many airlines are now banning it — not least because it causes so many arguments. But there are many other ways of getting the room you want on an aeroplane.

Obviously, for those of us with deep wallets, flying in anything above economy class is the best way to stretch out, but that can cost many hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds.

However, there are plenty of seats in economy that do offer almost as much space as business class. The key is learning how to find them.

The place where legroom aficionados look are websites such as seatguru.com and seatexpert.com, which show diagrams of all the cabins of the planes operated by the world’s major airlines.

On seatguru seats are graded with colours — green for desirable, grey for standard, yellow for beware and red for poor.

So, if you are flying in Europe on a British Airways Airbus A319, you will see that the best seats in Euro Traveller (the airline’s euphemism for economy) are in Row 9, because they all offer more legroom owing to their position at the bulkhead — the wall or partition that separates different seat classes in the aircraft.

Flying on a Virgin Atlantic 747-400 from Gatwick or Manchester? Seatexpert advises you to sit in 61A or K, 62A or K, 63A or K, as these seats are wider and you get more storage space.

Most of the seats in Rows 64 and 65 are graded as ‘beware’ — their proximity to the lavatories means that you will be bumped into throughout the night as you try to nod off on your way to Tampa.

These websites are also great places to find which airlines offer the most space. Some of the results are surprising. Did you know that the Airbus A330s operated by Russia’s Aeroflot airline — long the recipient of digs for its supposedly utilitarian design — have seats in long-haul economy which, at 20.6in, are just over 3in wider than those on the almost fabled Cathay Pacific?

The best way to get hold of the good seats is to check in online as soon as you can — which is normally 24 hours before departure.

However, many airlines are wise to this trick, and now charge passengers a premium for bagging the best seats early.

If you do manage to secure good seats, then you should enjoy them while you can.

Last month, manufacturer Airbus filed a patent for a new kind of economy seat altogether — akin to a bicycle saddle, which certainly wouldn’t recline but would allow airlines to cram even more passengers into their planes.
