Ninety years ago this month, British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun and set in motion a chain of events that brought scandal, infighting and rumours of a famous curse all the way from Egypt back to England and Highclere Castle – known to television audiences as Downton Abbey.

As he peered into a hole in a door of the boy king’s tomb, his financial backer, the 5th Earl of Carnarvon and owner of Highclere, asked: ‘Can you see anything?’ ‘I see wonderful things,’ came the famous reply.

Within, they found treasures beyond their wildest imagining:  thousands of statues, vases, paintings and the ornate sarcophagus in which the king’s mummified body lay, all glittering with gold and  precious jewels. Somehow they had survived for 33 centuries, safe from robbers who had plundered all  the other tombs in the Valley of the Kings. It was the greatest archaeological find of all time.

As a British adventurer, Carter should be up there with David Livingstone and Captain Cook. Instead, his reputation is marred by accusations that he turned grave robber, pinching dozens of items for himself and Carnarvon, and that no one actually knows what the tomb looked like when he found it because his reports on the excavation are a pack of lies.

According to Carter’s story, he found the tomb’s entrance on November 4, 1922 and cabled Carnarvon  to sail from London. Carter waited until his backer arrived before they went down the steps on November 26. He poked a hole in the door, held a candle to test for noxious fumes and peered in to  see piles of lavish ornaments, shimmering with gold.

Carter’s notes record that they then resealed the hole so they could fulfil their legal duty of telling Egypt’s Director-General of Antiquities. But did they really?

Carter and Carnarvon knew the find would put them in the history books and I don’t believe for a second that they didn’t explore the tomb that night. There’s plenty of evidence that far from resealing the hole, Carter enlarged it to let himself, Carnarvon and Carnarvon’s daughter Evelyn climb in. The Earl’s  half-brother Mervyn Herbert wrote in his journal that they confessed ‘under the strictest promise of secrecy’ that they went through to the inner chamber.

It seems they also removed small souvenirs that night, such as figurines or jewellery – anything bigger would have been noticed by workmen outside. Their pockets must have been stuffed as they returned to the Winter Palace Hotel in Luxor.

But one evening’s pilfering doesn’t explain the sheer number of Tutankhamun artefacts in museums and collections round the world. Evidence has emerged that points to a quite different story. Some experts think Carter found the tomb several months before he told Carnarvon, giving ample time to explore it and sneak out dozens of items.

What would Lord Grantham say: The Egyptian treasures currently at display at Highclere - or The Crawley family's Downton to the rest of us - are stolen, according to Egyptian authorities

Carter, a knowledgable dealer in antiquities, had helped Carnarvon amass a significant collection of Egyptian tomb artefacts. They worked together on several digs before gaining a concession in the Valley of the Kings in 1914.

During work in 1922, his men reached a spot inches from where the  tomb’s entrance would be found when Carter told them to move some  distance away. Had he found the entrance? If so, he had good reason to keep it under his hat.

Carter claimed there were clear signs that robbers broke seals on the tomb shortly after Tutankhamun was laid to rest in 1323BC, stealing perfume bottles and disturbing the careful array. This would have been very helpful, because under the terms of his licence to dig, his team was entitled to keep half of any treasure if  he could prove the tomb had been broken into before their arrival.

But if robbers had found their way in, why did they leave behind so many priceless golden objects? Alfred Lucas, an employee at the 1922 dig, admitted in 1947 that he saw Carter break open a door and relock it, with an antique seal, but no one paid much attention at the time.

As part of his evidence of previous break-ins, Carter showed a photo of a footprint he claimed was made by a robber, but modern experts say it doesn’t resemble an ancient Egyptian sandal. In fact, it appears to be the sole of a modern shoe – much like the type Carter himself wore.

Carnarvon was optimistic the Egyptian authorities would agree he was entitled to half the treasure – but in April 1923, he died of septicaemia from an infected mosquito bite. He had owned the concession, and arguments sprang up. The Director-General of Antiquities wanted to retain it all for Egypt. One thing was for sure: Carter wasn’t entitled to anything.

There was talk back in 1923 that items had been illegally removed.  Carter was nearly caught in the act when Egyptian inspectors found a painted bust packed into a Fortnum & Mason box, as if waiting to be sneaked away. Somehow he managed to talk his way out of trouble.

Carter began quietly distributing gifts from the tomb, with US oil baron Edward Harkness receiving a gold ring. He gave an amulet to a fellow Egyptologist, Sir Alan Gardiner. Then, when Carter died in 1939, dozens of valuable and important items from the tomb were found in his house, including a shabti [figurine] and a glass head-rest with a gold band. His looting was now an open secret.

Lord Carnarvon’s wife Almina became convinced that he had died as a result of the ‘Curse of Tutankhamun’, especially after several others associated with the dig died in the years immediately after the tomb was disturbed. She begged Carter to remove the collection of Egyptian artefacts from Highclere and he sold most to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Remaining treasures were packed away in cupboards at Highclere  and forgotten.

In 2010, the Met agreed to return to Egypt 19 antiquities, including a lapis-lazuli sphinx and a bronze figure of a dog with a golden collar.

The Met is not alone. Egyptologist Christian Loeben visited the Louvre in 2010 and found a shabti with Tutankhamun’s throne name written on it, which he claims could only be from the tomb. Two golden hawks’ heads were found in Kansas City, part of  a collar that broke as it was removed from the mummy’s neck. The story goes they were a gift from Carter to his dentist. He seems to have been very generous with his plunder.

And what of Highclere? In 1987, the 7th Earl of Carnarvon unlocked a door that had been closed for many years and found pigeonholes full of packages which turned out to contain finds from the 5th Earl’s excavations. He dusted them down and put them on display. Recently, as Downton Abbey’s success has drawn attention to the house, authorities in Egypt have said all the Tutankhamun antiquities were stolen and asked for the return of any original items at Highclere. The Earl argues that he does not have any, only replicas, and that the other antiquities were obtained fairly. It’s never been definitively established where the 5th Earl’s  Tutankhamun souvenirs ended up.

The fact remains that Carter made a phenomenal discovery in the Valley of the Kings in 1922. The ancient solemnity of the tomb gets under your skin. It inspired me to write about the discovery of the tomb in a new novel set in the Twenties. So perhaps, on the 90th anniversary, we should proclaim it as a great British success story. Carter was certainly a giant of British Egyptology. As it turns out, however, he was an untruthful giant with rather sticky fingers.
