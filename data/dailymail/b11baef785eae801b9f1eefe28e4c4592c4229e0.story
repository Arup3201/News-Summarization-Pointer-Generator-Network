Gabriel Paulista has been granted a UK work permit, clearing the path for him to complete an £11.2million switch to Arsenal.

The Villarreal defender is completing his medical and provided the procedure doesn't flag up any issues, the 24-year-old will seal his move to the Emirates on Monday.

There were fears that Paulista would be denied a work permit due to the fact he has not played international football.

However, the application for the Brazilian has been approved and he is now virtually certain to complete his switch from Spain.

Speaking about the move on Sunday, Wenger said: 'The deal is on the line and should move over the line overnight.' 

Paulista is expected to join the club imminently with Joel Campbell joining the La Liga side on loan for the remainder of the season as part of the agreement.
