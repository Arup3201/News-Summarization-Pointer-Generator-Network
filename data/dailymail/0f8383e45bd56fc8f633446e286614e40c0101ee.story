A BBC programme due to be aired last night which promised to unmask 'Fake Sheikh' Mazher Mahmood was shelved at the eleventh hour after a last minute submission by his lawyer.

The corporation had intended to broadcast Panorama, Fake Sheikh: Exposed at 8.30pm following the Court of Appeal's decision today to allow producers to broadcast recent images of the undercover reporter.

But shortly before the programme was scheduled to air, Mr Mahmood's lawyers submitted new information relating to one of the cases it included. 

Mr Mahmood's lawyers had previously lost a High Court challenge to prevent his image from being broadcast.

The investigative journalist had launched a last minute challenge against a High Court judge's refusal on Friday to grant him an injunction over tonight's screening, claiming his human rights would be jeopardised. 

He claimed that revealing his current appearance would exacerbate the existing risk to his safety caused by his investigative work and would impact upon his family life.

But, Lord Justice Elias and Lady Justice Sharp refused him permission to appeal, saying he had not shown any error in Sir David Eady's ruling.

A Panorama programme examining his methods was due to be shown on BBC1 last night at 8.30pm.

But despite the outcome in court, the BBC instead decided to show a Panorama episode investigating the disappearance of Blackpool schoolgirl Charlene Downes. 

BBC head of news James Harding said: 'This is a seriously good piece of work, extremely revealing and squarely in the public interest. But the worst of all worlds is when you get the big picture right, and trip up over a detail.

'So when some information we'd been asking to see for many days was sent to us by Mazher Mahmood's lawyers at seven o'clock last night, we, as a responsible broadcaster, had to consider it.

'We're looking at it, and we'll make sense of it as quickly as we can, and then we'll broadcast it.' 

It is believed BBC bosses are keen to air the programme as soon as the legal issue has been resolved, meaning it could be screened later this week.

It was reported this morning that the corporation had been chasing Mr Mahmood's lawyers over information for a number of days before the programme was due to air. 

The investigative reporter was the key prosecution witness against former N-Dubz singer Tulisa Contostavlos, but the case collapsed in July

A  BBC spokesperson said: 'The BBC had intended to broadcast Panorama, Fake Sheikh: Exposed tonight following the Court of Appeal's decision earlier today to allow the BBC to broadcast images of Mazher Mahmood.

'Shortly before transmission Mr Mahmood's lawyers submitted new information relating to one of the cases in the programme which, as a responsible broadcaster, the BBC needs to evaluate. Once this has been done we will broadcast Fake Sheikh: Exposed, including recent footage of Mr Mahmood, as planned.'

Mr Mahmood later said: 'I hope the BBC will see sense and postpone any broadcast until the conclusion of any proceedings.

'I hope then that they will review and consider the evidence properly (and not threaten broadcast without the full facts) and stop the broadcast. This may be a vain hope. They are determined to condemn me whatever the truth.

'In the meantime, if they do go ahead, I would ask anyone interested to keep an open mind on any allegations they do indeed make.' 

The reporter's elaborate stings led to the exposure of dozens of people, from hapless royals to hardened criminals while he worked for the now defunct News of the World. 

Mr Mahmood was the key prosecution witness against former N-Dubz singer Tulisa Contostavlos, but the case collapsed in July when judge Alistair McCreath told the jury at Southwark Crown Court that there were 'strong grounds' to believe that Mr Mahmood had lied on the witness stand and 'had been manipulating the evidence'.

Mr Mahmood, who denies any wrongdoing and has not been charged, is currently suspended by The Sun and a number of cases in which he was set to be a witness have been dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service while investigations continue.

Last week, Mr Mahmood's counsel Adam Speker told the High Court judge that showing his current appearance in a broadcast which was likely to be watched by millions was intrusive and not in the public interest.

Because of his work, threats had been made to Mr Mahmood, who lived a reclusive life in secure accommodation with 24-hour surveillance and where his neighbours did not know his real identity, he said.

The programme, was described by Mr Mahmood's counsel, Justin Rushbrooke QC as a 'hatchet job',

The injunction he sought would have covered any images taken since April 5 2006 not already in the public domain.

Mr Mahmood had been filmed in shadow during an appearance on the Andrew Marr show in 2008, photos in a memoir he had written were not sufficient to identify him and various courts, including the Leveson inquiry, had taken steps to conceal his physical identity.

Manuel Barca QC, for the BBC, said that Mr Mahmood's identity was no secret and that the case was not about any fears for his safety but about protecting his livelihood and the shelf life of his professional stock-in-trade.

He said the public interest was self-evident, not least in the context of the Contostavlos trial.

The judge ruled that Mr Mahmood had not discharged the heavy burden of proof under the Articles of the Human Rights Act upon which he relied.

In a trailer for tonight's Panorama, the BBC said it would broadcast interviews with some of Mr Mahmood's highest profile targets and the men who helped him expose them. They allege that the Fake Sheikh was the real crook, using sophisticated entrapment and even creating crimes and fabricating evidence.

In 2011, Mahmood exposed the Pakistan cricket 
cheats whose fixing scandal rocked the sport.

His
 trademark disguise was born in 1984 when he was sent to expose a vice 
ring operating out of a hotel near the Birmingham National Exhibition 
Centre.

He decided to pose as a wealthy young Arab looking to buy a Ferrari. With
 a huge gold Rolex on his wrist and a deferential entourage of hired 
hands surrounding him, the 'King of the Stings' found he could get 
access to pretty much any well-known individual.

In
 2005, Princess Michael of Kent was exposed by the Fake Sheikh making 
some startling comments about fellow royals. She described the late 
Princess Diana as a 'nasty'  woman and said Prince Charles had merely 
married a 'womb'.

But his career has featured some high-profile failures. In 2002, he claimed to have uncovered a plot to kidnap 
Victoria Beckham and her sons and ransom them for £5million.

Five men
 were arrested. But the case collapsed as the main witness, a Kosovan 
asylum seeker, was deemed unreliable and had been paid £10,000 for the 
story.

In 2006, he clashed with George Galloway, who claimed the reporter attempted to trap him by posing as an Islamic businessman.

The Respect MP responded by circulating photos on the internet Mahmood - threatening his anonymity - after the journalist failed in his bid to ban their 
publication.
