A man whose scalp resembled the surface of a brain has had life-changing surgery to make it smooth.

Kassim Robinson, 30, of Summit, suffered from a rare medical condition that caused the skin on his scalp to thicken and bunch together in folds that looked like a brain – two recent surgeries made the problem disappear.

Robinson told ABC News the pain caused by cutis verticis gyrate was intense, and the disorder forced him to wear his hair in dreadlocks or with a flat top since being diagnosed in high school.

'I always had a lot of skin on my head, Robinson told ABC. ‘I went to the barber and he said, ‘Wow, there’s a lot of wrinkles on your head.’

His scalp was four times thicker than average and rose about an inch from his skull, doctor Ramtin Kassir told ABC.

‘It was really debilitating, both cosmetically and functionally,’ Kassir said of the disorder he solved with two surgeries.

The two procedures, each two hours in length, involved removing giant swaths of skin and stretch the scalp to cover the open space, he told the network.

There is no other known cure for the malady, and, among the small number of people stricken with CVG, men outnumber women five to one, according to a 2001 study.

‘I’d never done this before’ he explained, adding he had only seen it in medical textbooks, ‘but [Robinson] insisted.’

In the four weeks since the second surgery, Robinson has a new lease on life.

‘It’s perfect,’ he told ABC, ‘no more dreadlocks, no more ‘fros, no more flat tops.’

Also, more importantly, no more pain, he said, adding ‘I’m so happy.’
