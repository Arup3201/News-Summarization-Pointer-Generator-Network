This tabby cat looks a long way from home. Cuddling up to lions, stalking zebras and tormenting a elephant by pouncing at its tail, it's rather different from attacking mice in the back garden.

Every cat owner knows its pet will do whatever it wishes, so it may be unsurprising to see a house cat fearlessly roaming around a game reserve and daring to get close to big predators.

But if you thought the friendly feline was in danger from the bigger cats, think again. The playful pictures are the work of photographer George Logan and digital retoucher Tony Swinney for a Whiskas advertising campaign.

This tabby cat looks like it's squaring up to a herd of zebras in South Africa, a long way from home

Pounce! Photographer George Logan and digital retoucher Tony Swinney made it look like this tabby had found a new toy in an elephant's tail

The photographs of the wild animals were
taken on the Shamwari Game Reserve in South Africa and the cat was 
added on later for its own safety.

The campaign by Whiskas, known as Big Cat, Small Cat, urges owners to feed their pet's instincts with its food.

House cats share the hunting behaviour of their larger relations, from going on the prowl to toying with their prey.

The stunning images show that, despite the big difference in their size, lions, leopards and cats aren't so different at all and the family ties are strong.

The Shamwari Game Reserve, which opened in 1992, is near to Port Elizabeth and supported by the Born Free Foundation, which campaigns for animal welfare and helped Whiskas with the photo shoot.

Afterwards, the tabby cat was added to the shots so there was no danger involved
