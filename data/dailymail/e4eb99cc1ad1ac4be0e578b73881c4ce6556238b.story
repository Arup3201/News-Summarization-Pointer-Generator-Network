So there will be no Manchester derby in Miami after all following the second penalty shootout defeat to befall Manuel Pellegrini and his Premier League champions in the space of four days.

They did not seem particularly upset about that as the squad flew out of Minneapolis in the early hours of Sunday morning and headed for Manchester instead of Florida where neighbours United will now face Liverpool on Monday night.

With the remainder of his World Cup contingent due to report back at the start of the week and Frank Lampard arriving on Wednesday, Pellegrini was just grateful there were no injuries on a pitch he had described as ‘high risk’ beforehand.

Blow: Manchester City drew 2-2 with Olympiacos in Minneapolis but were defeated 5-4 on penalties

Shot stopper: Roberto Jimenez Gago was the hero for the Greek side in the shootout

Big win: The Greek contingent in the United States grapple for a shirt of their heroes

Opponents 
Olympiacos had even refused to train on the temporary grass surface at 
the University of Minnesota’s TCF Bank Stadium and the game only went 
ahead after urgent talks on Friday night. It passed off without any 
problem after the surface was heavily sanded and watered overnight and 
then touched up with painted green.

City
 twice went ahead through Stevan Jovetic’s fifth goal in three games on 
tour and an Aleksandar Kolarov penalty only to pegged back on both 
occasions – just as they had been by Liverpool at Yankee Stadium on 
Wednesday – as Dimitrios Diamantakos claimed both goals for the Greeks.

Joe
 Hart’s unconventional save with his foot from Avraam Papadopoulos sent 
the shootout to sudden-death after James Milner and Scott Sinclair both 
saw their attempts saved, but Micah Richards blasted wildly over with 
what may prove to be his last kick for City and Anastasios Papazoglou 
wrapped up victory.

At
 least Pellegrini now has two more days at home to prepare for next 
weekend’s Community Shield against Arsenal. ‘I said the pitch was a high
 risk but they worked hard on it to improve it and fortunately nothing 
happened,’ he said.

Hope: Joe Hart did make a fine save with his leg during the penalty shootout

Teamwork: Stevan Jovetic is congratulated by Edin Dzeko after he put Manchester City in front on Saturday

‘The
 tour has been extremely useful and the team have been professional. 
We’ve had some great performances but the condition of the pitches 
condition has hindered us.

‘The
 positive of these few games has been the quality of the games and the 
levels my players reached. The negative will be the travelling 
distances.

‘We are not ready for the new season yet because the rest of our squad are only coming back on Monday.’

Jovetic
 fired City ahead in the 35th minute after Samir Nasri flicked the ball 
to him near the left touchline. The Montenegrin produced a burst of pace
 to get away from three Greek defenders, and when two more closed him 
down inside the box he steered a clever shot between them and inside the
 neat post with goalkeeper Roberto wrong-footed.

Olympiacos
 were level two minutes later, however, when a neat move opened up the 
City defence. Captain Ionnis Maniatis squared the ball to danger man 
Diamantakos who drilled it past Hart despite the keeper getting a hand 
to it.

Both
 teams had a goal ruled out for offside, Diamantakos in the second 
minute after another incisive move and Edin Dzeko shortly before 
half-time.

In form: Jovetic scored five goals in three games in the International Champions Cup

Poacher: But Dimitrios Diamantakos was impressive two, notching a double for his side

Blow: Olympiacos replied almost immediately in Minneapolis in the International Champions Cup

OLYMPIACOS: Roberto, Elabdellaoui, Manolas (Ghazaryan 63), Siovas (Papadopoulos 13), Masuaku, Samaris, Maniatis, Kasami (Bouchakalis 63), Dominguez (Avlonitis 63), Saviola (Dossevi 46), Diamantakos.

Goals: Diamantakos (36, 66).

MANCHESTER CITY: Hart, Clichy (Milner 46), Kolarov, Boyata, Rekik, Fernando (Garcia 46), Navas (Silva 46), Toure (Richards 46), Nasri (Zuculini 46), Jovetic (Sinclair 75), Dzeko (Guidetti 46).

Goals: Jovetic (34), Kolarov (53, pen).

Booking: Kolarov (45), Milner (50).

There
 was also one penalty appeal apiece with Olympiacos coach Michel 
striding onto the pitch gesticulating angrily when Dedryck Boyata’s 
challenge sent Diamantakos tumbling as he raced in on goal. It was a 
50-50 call by referee Fotis Bazakos but Michel, for one, certainly felt 
as though he had got it wrong.

City
 were equally aggrieved on the stroke of half-time, Kolarov talking his 
way into the official’s notebook as he protested against the decision 
not to award a penalty against substitute Papadopoulos when his untidy 
challenge upended Jovetic.

City
 had the best of the other first-half opportunities. Nasri dragged his 
low shot wide when Yaya Toure picked him out unmarked in the box, 
Jovetic sidefooted over from an even better position following good work
 by Jesus Navas and Dzeko who then squared a wonderful pass that invited
 a close-range finished from Nasri but the Frenchman seemed a little 
reluctant to go into the challenge with the keeper.

Tough tackle: Manchester City forward Stevan Jovetic worked tirelessly throughout the match

Tight marking: Two Olympiacos players double up on City winger Jesus Navas

Wrestle: Samir Nasri is tugged back by Avraam Papadopolous during the game

It
 was Nasri’s last contribution to the game because he was one of six 
changes made by Pellegrini at half-time. The City boss would probably 
have done it anyway but the intense heat – the players twice stopped for
 a water break  – and state of the pitch no doubt played a part in his 
thinking as well.

It
 was one of the substitutes who earned City the penalty from which 
Kolarov restored their lead in the 53rd minute. David Silva combined 
with Jovetic and then cut inside Kostas Manolas who clearly brought the 
Spaniard down. There was no hesitation from Mr Bazakos on this occasion 
and Kolarov steered his spot-kick into the roof of the net.

Diamantakos
 struck again in the 66th minute, however, when Olympiacos levelled 
against the run of play. Neither Boyata nor Karim Rekik were alive to 
the danger when Gevorg Ghazaryan slipped a pass in behind them, and 
Diamantakos took the ball around Hart before scoring from a tight angle.

Neither
 side were able to produce a winner, meaning that City were already 
relying on Liverpool losing against AC Milan before they went into the 
shootout. It went against them again but Pellegrini is unlikely to have 
lost much sleep over it on the flight back.
