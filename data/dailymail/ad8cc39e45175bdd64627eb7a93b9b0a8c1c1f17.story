Petra Maison, pictured wearing her clothes yesterday, launched the line in Sweden after finding ordinary working clothes were ill-fitting and designed for men

There was a time when a woman would reach for a pair of old jeans and a tatty jumper to do the gardening.

But this year’s Chelsea Flower Show looks set to raise flowerbeds in the fashion stakes.

One of the most crowded pitches yesterday was designer Petra Maison’s range of ‘feminine and practical’ gardening clothes.

Her Garden Girl collection, admired by Prince Charles, may be designed for maximum comfort but many will think the full ensemble is less than flattering.

And wearers will have to fork out for the privilege – a pair of rose-patterned dungarees is priced at £66.95 and the entire kit modelled costs £387.60.

Mrs Maison, pictured wearing her clothes yesterday, launched the line in Sweden after finding ordinary working clothes were ill-fitting and designed for men.

The 40-year-old said: ‘I became addicted to gardening but when my husband bought work clothes for me to do the gardening in they weren’t comfortable and I hated them.

‘I wanted to make clothes that were made for women’s shapes which were feminine and practical. I have designed something that I want to wear myself.’

Her range includes durable ladies wear and tools ranging in price from £9.99 to £79. The couple have been running the business in Sweden for six years and have struggled to keep up with demand.

She said: ‘We first sold it at a Swedish show like this and were worried no one would buy it. But on the second day of the five-day event we sold out.

‘In the early days of the business we struggled to keep up with demand, so we are really excited to be bringing the collection to the UK.’

Elsewhere in the show a group of Australians were also struggling to contain their glee, after Phillip Johnson and Fleming’s Nurseries were awarded the coveted prize of Best in Show for their Trailfinders garden.

The Australian-inspired garden features 300 tons of Scottish gabbro rock, a billabong, a waterfall, natural Australian plants and sounds of Yarra Valley frogs recorded in designer Phillip Johnson’s garden.

The garden, which has a self-sustaining eco system, was awarded a gold medal as well as Best in Show.

When the Best in Show title was announced Tim Wilkinson, a volunteer who helped create the garden, jumped into the billabong wearing only his underwear in celebration.

Mr Johnson said: ‘Winning today was the most amazing feeling ever, after becoming a father. We were jumping up and down like a bunch of madmen when Best in Show was announced.

‘Being involved in Chelsea was a dream come true for myself and my team. Winning an award amongst contemporaries of this calibre is absolutely mind-blowing.

‘We came here with a very ambitious vision - to showcase Australia, our horticultural industry and to educate the world on the possibilities of sustainable landscape design.

‘We’re extremely proud of the magic rock embankment and the first ever Chelsea Flower Show featured rock gardens so it’s great to see this 100 years later.'

He added: ‘It’s very difficult to put a price on the garden; we worked with volunteers and had an enormous amount of donations of materials.

‘At a guess I would say it cost £2.2million to £3million, there’s only one of these in the world after all.’

Mr Johnson said: 'Winning today was most amazing feeling ever, after becoming a father. We were jumping up and down like a bunch of madmen when Best in Show was announced'
