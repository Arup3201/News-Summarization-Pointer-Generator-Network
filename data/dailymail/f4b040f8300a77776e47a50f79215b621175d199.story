Eight-year-old Lincoln Boucher took no notice of the scratch he got from a swooping bat.

The boy carried on as normal at the Queensland Whitsunday islands resort where his parents worked.

But hours later Lincoln was frothing at the mouth, writhing with seizures and tearing out the IV lines doctors had inserted into him as a rabies-like disease tore through his body.

Eight-year-old Lincoln Boucher spent two months in hospital fighting the rabies-like disease lyssavirus before doctors found out what his illness was

Lincoln's parents Michelle Flynn and Colin Boucher told Australia's 60 Minutes that their son could have survived if he'd told them about getting scratched by a bat

Lincoln had become the third-known Australian victim of lyssavirus, which spread through his body and attacked his brain, claiming his life on February 2.

Now his parents Michelle Flynn and Colin Boucher say their son would be alive if only he had told them about the scratch from the bat.

Miss Flynn told 60 Minutes that she realised something was wrong when Lincoln developed a temperature.

Overnight he developed seizures. At hospital, tests could not identify what was wrong with him.

'He was scaredâ€¦and that's when he knelt 
up on the bed and ripped out the IV lines and nurses and doctors came 
running,' Miss Flynn told the programme.

Lincoln was put into an induced coma but the virus was so powerful that the boy repeatedly returned to consciousness.

Stricken with delirium and convulsions, he struggled with the virus for two months before his sister Lauren told doctors about the bat scratch he'd received.

By then, it was too late to administer a vaccine as the symptoms of the virus had taken hold.

'He was a pretty tough little boy,' said his mother. 'He just wouldn't have known to tell us [about the scratch].'

As his condition worsened, Lincoln was successfully put into a coma.

Doctors brough him back to consciousness so his parents could speak to him one last time before his death.

A bite or a scratch resulting in victims of lyssavirus turning violent and frothing at the mouth as it makes its way towards the brain, where it replicates and causes irreparable damage.

The two earlier lyssavirus deaths in Australia also occurred in Queensland.

In 1996 an animal carer died following a scratch from a yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat.

In that same year, a woman was bitten on a finger by a bat while attempting to remove it from a child it had landed on. It was 27 months before the virus manifested itself and she died in hospital.

Almost all human deaths from rabies occur in Asia and Africa. Although there are no rabid animals in Australia, bats carrying the virus have been found throughout the country.

The lyssavirus was identified in bats in 2003 and while extremely rare world-wide, death is certain to follow unless a victim is treated quickly.

Lincoln became Australia's third victim of lyssavirus. The two other deaths also occurred in Queensland
