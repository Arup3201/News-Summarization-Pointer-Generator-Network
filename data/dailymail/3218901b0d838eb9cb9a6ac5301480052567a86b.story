Celebrities, civil rights campaigners and politicians today called for Barack Obama to secure the release of a father from London who has spent 13 years languishing in Guantanamo Bay without trial.

Their plea, in a letter to the Daily Mail, urges the Prime Minister to ‘pick up the phone to President Obama, and bring Shaker Aamer home’.

The letter comes days after the Mail exposed how the British resident – who has a British wife and four children – has been held without being tried for more than a decade in the notorious Cuban jail.

It will add to pressure on the Government to step up its efforts in the case and secure Mr Aamer’s return to this country.

Organised by the We Stand With Shaker campaign, the letter has been signed by MPs from across the political spectrum, including former Tory shadow home secretary David Davis, Lib Dem MP and former Home Office minister Norman Baker, and Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn.

Celebrity backers include Roger Waters of Pink Floyd, TV presenter Janet Ellis and her singer daughter Sophie Ellis-Bextor, and the actress Juliet Stevenson.

It is also signed by journalist and author Peter Oborne, poet Benjamin Zephaniah, and novelist Gillian Slovo as well as prominent human rights campaigners including the Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti.

They say Mr Aamer’s continued detention without charge or trial is ‘in violation of the right not to be arbitrarily imprisoned that was enshrined in Magna Carta’.

Calling on the PM to address the case ‘urgently’, they say the Briton’s ongoing imprisonment is ‘all the more shocking’ because he has twice been approved for release by the US government.

They refer to a letter Mr Cameron sent to Mr Aamer’s daughter Johina last June, in which he said the decision regarding release was ‘ultimately in the hands of the US Government’.

Their letter also refers to ‘rumours’ that the US would like to send Mr Aamer back to Saudi Arabia, where he was born, claiming this would leave him ‘unable to talk about the torture and abuse he has witnessed and personally experienced during his long imprisonment’.

It adds: ‘What the US would like to do with Mr Aamer is irrelevant, as the British Government has a non-negotiable responsibility to secure the return of Mr Aamer, given his status as a legal British resident.

‘We can find no reason why, given the special relationship between our two countries, the PM cannot call President Obama and tell him that Mr Aamer must be returned to the UK as swiftly as possible.We urge Mr Cameron to pick up the phone to President Obama, and to bring Shaker Aamer home.’

Mr Aamer’s case was given new prominence following the release of a US Senate report into how the CIA tortured terror suspects.

According to his family, who live in Battersea, South London, the 46-year-old is desperate to stand trial over claims that he is a terrorist with close links to Osama Bin Laden.

His lawyers say he is being held at the US base because intelligence officials fear he could expose more evidence of torture in the presence of British intelligence officers.

Last week, Downing Street insisted that the UK continued to press the case at the ‘highest levels’ – diplomatic code for the White House

A spokesman for Mr Cameron said the Government was pushing for Mr Aamer’s release ‘as a matter of urgency’.

She said: ‘We will keep pressing it. It is our objective to get him back to the UK. That decision is in the hands of the US government.’

Mr Aamer has twice been cleared for release, originally in 2007, but his detention has been extended again and again because officials insist he must go back to Saudi Arabia, rather than home to Britain.

Torture: A US senate report last week laid bare the full, horrifying extent of detainees' treatment at the base

He was detained in Kabul, in 2001. His representatives claim he had travelled to Afghanistan to carry out peaceful voluntary work for an Islamic charity.

They say he was captured by bounty hunters and eventually handed to US forces, who allegedly tortured him at a secret ‘black site’ prison – effectively a dungeon – at Bagram air force base, near Kabul. 

He was then sent to Guantanamo Bay in February 2002, where he remains with about 130 prisoners.

As we approach 2015, the 800th anniversary of the signing of Magna Carta, which introduced habeas corpus to the world, we call on David Cameron to urgently address the case of Shaker Aamer, a legal British resident with a British wife and four British children.

He continues to be imprisoned without charge or trial in the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in violation of the right not to be arbitrarily imprisoned which was enshrined in Magna Carta.

Mr Aamer’s ongoing imprisonment is all the more shocking because he has been approved for release by the U.S. on two occasions — by a military review board under President George W. Bush in 2007 and by a high-level, inter-agency task force under President Obama in 2009.

The British Government has been requesting his return since 2007, and we received assurances from Mr Cameron in June 2013 that he had raised Mr Aamer’s case with President Obama.

Torture at Guantanamo including waterboarding and rectal feeding was dubbed 'brutal and ineffective'

In a letter to Mr Aamer’s daughter, Johina, last June, the PM wrote: ‘Despite efforts to secure his release, it remains the case that he has been cleared for transfer but not for release.’ He added: ‘It also remains the case that any decision regarding your father’s release remains ultimately in the hands of the U.S. government.’

Does Mr Cameron’s comment to Mr Aamer’s daughter about being cleared for transfer refer to rumours that the U.S. government would like to send Mr Aamer, a Londoner, back to Saudi Arabia, the country of his birth?

This would, no doubt, be convenient for the U.S., as from there Mr Aamer would be unable to talk about the torture and abuse he has witnessed and personally experienced during his long imprisonment.

However, what the U.S. would like to do with Mr Aamer is irrelevant, as the British Government has a non-negotiable responsibility to secure the return of Mr Aamer, given his status as a legal British resident.

We can find no reason why, given the special relationship between our two countries, the Prime Minister cannot call President Obama and tell him that Mr Aamer must be returned to the UK as swiftly as possible. We urge Mr Cameron to pick up the phone to President Obama, and to bring Shaker Aamer home.
