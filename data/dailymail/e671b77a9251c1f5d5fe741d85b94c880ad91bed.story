New pictures have surfaced showing a different side to Darren Wilson, the Ferugson, Missouri police officer who shot dead unarmed black teen Michael Brown last month. 

Wilson has been in hiding since the deadly confrontation, as protesters descended on the St Louis suburb and clashed with police, enraged by the 18-year-old's killing.

Previously, only one picture of the 28-year-old police officer was released, taken by his father as he accepted an award with the department.

Pictured: New photos have been released showing Darren Wilson, the Ferguson, Missouri police officer who shot dead unarmed teen Michael Brown last month. All but one of the new pictures show Wilson at his wedding in October 2011

Stature: The new pictures show Wilson is of a sturdy build, and considerably taller than the rest of his wedding party in the group shot. Supporters have defended Wilson by saying he was intimidated by Brown, who was 6-foot-4 and about 300 pounds

Broken up: Wilson and wife Ashley Nicole were married in Old Monroe, Missouri in October 2011 but divorced last year 

Selfie: The last picture show Wilson and an unidentified woman in a photo originally posted to Facebook

But on Wednesday, the website Colorlines was the first to publish a batch of new pictures showing Wilson at his wedding, and taking a selfie with an unidentified woman. 

The pictures of Wilson at his wedding, taken by a professional photographer and guests at the nuptials, are especially important considering what has been said about his fight with Michael Brown, the afternoon of August 9.

Wilson got into a physical fight with Brown after stopping the teen for walking into the middle of the street, and the altercation ended when witnesses saw Wilson shoot Brown as he was surrendering with his hands up.

Supporters of Wilson have defended his actions by saying he was threatened by Brown, who was 6-foot-4 and 300 pounds and described as a 'gentle giant' by friends and family.

'I can even say without speaking to Darren, without even having heard his statements, that at that moment in time, he was scared for his life, I am 100% positive of that,' Wilson's longtime friend Jake Shepard told CNN.

Local police also played up the intimidation story by releasing a video of Brown allegedly threatening a shop owner during a robbery just prior to his death.

Stills of the robbery were released the day Wilson was named, along with a description of the shots saying Brown 'towers over [name redacted] appearing to intimidate him. Brown then turns back around and walks out of camera view.'

But Wilson appears to have the same body type in the pictures at his wedding in October 2011. Wilson stands well above the wedding party and has a brawny build. 

Another picture shows a better close up view of Wilson's face, next to that of a woman who has been blurred out. 

The wedding pictures were taken in  Old Monroe, Missouri, which is about a half-hour outside Jennings where Wilson was a police officer at the time. 

Soon after the wedding, Wilson left the department to work for the Ferguson Police. 

Wilson and his wife divorced in November. 

Aftermath: Witnesses say Wilson finished the fight by shooting Brown just as he was surrendering with his hands up. Above, a video still showing the aftermath of the shooting, with Wilson hovering at a distance from Brown's body

Outrage: Brown's shooting death led to several protests in the Missouri community, where locals clashed with police for several nights
