The JetBlue Airways pilot who disrupted a cross-country flight by leaving the cockpit to ramble about religion and terrorists has had a psychotic episode in prison and requires further mental evaluation, a judge said on Wednesday.

Captain Clayton Osbon was charged with interference with a flight crew but was found not guilty by reason of insanity last month.

A forensic neuro-psychologist testified in a short, unpublicized trial that Osbon had a 'brief psychotic disorder' at the time of the flight brought on by lack of sleep.

Veteran: Clayton Osbon was a respected airline 
captain before he went 'berserk' and began running through the cabin of 
his own plane. He had to be restrained by a passenger and was taken to a
mental hospital

Emergency landing: The co-pilot was forced to set the 
JetBlue plane doesn in Amarillo, Texas, after the Mr Osbon left the 
cockpit

Passengers said Osbon left the cockpit 
during a March 27 flight from New York to Las Vegas. He ran through the 
plane's cabin yelling about Jesus and al-Qaida. The flight was diverted 
and safely landed in Amarillo, Texas.

After the trial, Osbon was sent to a prison medical facility in North Carolina for evaluation. He was scheduled to return to Amarillo federal court this week for another hearing on whether he should go free or be sent to a mental health facility.

Instead, U.S. District Judge Mary Lou Robinson on Wednesday extended Osbon's evaluation period to October 15, with a final evaluation report due to her by the end of that month.

Robinson said she was notified by a forensic psychologist that Osbon 'had suffered a psychotic episode'.

She did not say what the nature of the episode was, if it was connected to his previous disorder or what prompted it. A message seeking comment was left for Osbon's attorney, Dean Roper.

Robinson's order said attorneys on both sides did not oppose the extension.

Neuropsychologist Robert E.H. Johnson testified in July that Osbon's psychotic disorder lasted about a week after the flight, according to a hearing transcript.

He didn't say how long Osbon had gone without sleeping before boarding the plane, and his psychiatric evaluation of Osbon has been sealed, but he determined Osbon suffered from brief psychotic disorder and delusions 'secondary to sleep deprivation'.

Those symptoms made Osbon incapable of understanding why his actions on the flight were wrong, Johnson testified.

Fit for trial? JetBlue captain Clayton Frederick Osbon, 
pictured being escorted by FBI agents, was found innocent by reason of insanity after being 
indicted on one count of interference of a crew on a flight from New York to Las 
Vegas

Lost control: Osbon, 49, screamed 'say your 
prayers, say your prayers' at horrified passengers after running up and 
down the aisle shouting 'Iraq, al-Qaeda, terrorism, we're all going 
down'

Osbon showed up unusually late for 
the March 27 flight. The plane was in midair when he told his first 
officer that they wouldn't make it to their destination, according to 
court documents.

Osbon started rambling about 
religion. He scolded air traffic controllers to quiet down, then turned 
off the radios altogether and dimmed the monitors in the cockpit. He 
said aloud that 'things just don't matter' and encouraged his co-pilot 
they take a leap of faith.

The first officer then 'became really
worried', according to a sworn affidavit from FBI agent John Whitworth.

'Osbon started trying to correlate completely unrelated numbers like 
different radio frequencies, and he talked about sins in Las Vegas.'

A flight attendant's ribs were bruised as passengers tried to restrain Osbon but no one on board was seriously injured.

At least 10 passengers have sued JetBlue over the incident.
