The father of the twin boys who were found smothered by their mother said that he didn’t even know that she was pregnant until he was called to testify at a court hearing.

Jeremy Smith testified in a Tennessee court on Thursday saying that he and Lindsey Lowe, the 26-year-old on trial for killing her newborn sons, had sex two or three times in early January 2011 but they hadn’t spoken since.

He only learned that she was pregnant- and that he was the father- after Lowe was charged with smothering the boys to death in an effort to keep her conservative parents unaware of her pregnancy. She said she was ‘scared what they would do or think’.

He was ‘shocked and couldn’t believe it’ when he heard, and he told lawyers that he would have helped her raise the children. He said that he took the news particularly hard because he was a twin himself.

According to The Tennessean, Smith was
not the only one left in the dark about the pregnancy, as Lowe claims 
to have not known herself.

She was engaged to another man, and 
cheated on her fiancé with Smith, so when her period stopped and she 
started gaining weight, she said that she was too afraid to seek medical
help or take a pregnancy test to check.

Throughout the trial, Lowe has been 
extremely emotional, hiding her head and at points sobbing in court. On 
Thursday, the judge had enough and snapped at her.

‘I will not have your emotions be on 
display for this jury,’ judge Dee David Gay told Lowe as she hid her 
head towards the ground.

‘Their job is hard enough and I won’t have you sitting there looking like a child.’

Earlier in the trial, it was revealed 
that Lowe told police the twins drowned in the toilet after she gave 
birth to them, before eventually breaking down and admitting she 
smothered them to stop them from crying.

Lindsey Lowe, 26, from 
Hendersonville, Tennessee, was taken into custody after her father 
discovered one of the baby's tiny bodies in the laundry basket of her 
bedroom.

He called 911 and police picked Lindsey up at the dental office where she worked.

It was only when she was being 
questioned that authorities found out there were in fact two babies, 
after Lindsey eventually revealed this to the officer in charge of 
questioning her.

The jury today were shown a tape of the lengthy interview on the third day of the murder trial.

Lowe is accused of keeping her 
pregnancy a secret, giving birth on the toilet, smothering the twin boys
to death and hiding their bodies in the laundry basket at her parent's 
affluent home in September 2011.

During the first half of the 
interview, Lowe explained briefly what happened to Detective Steve 
Malach, telling him she had been having back pain and shooting pains the
day of the births and it was only when she went to the toilet later - 
because she thought she was having a 'bowel movement' - that she 
realized she was giving birth.

She explained that the first baby fell into the toilet and she left him there and did not check on him, yet said she was sure he was dead. She said the same thing happened to the second baby.

The detective pressed her on how much the babies were under water and if they had been crying.

It was only when he told her that an autopsy would reveal exactly how the babies died did she breakdown and confess to smothering them.

Sobbing uncontrollably, Lowe said she did not want her 'conservative Christian parents' hearing the newborns cry so she put her hand over the first baby's mouth for 'a few minutes' until he stopped crying.

She did the same with his twin brother, the court heard.

When the officer asked her, 'You knew you killed the babies?' She replied, 'Yes.'

Though she told the detective at the very beginning of the interview the father of the twins was her fiance, she later admitted she had had an affair with a man called Jeremy Smith and that he was likely the father.

Though she never took a pregnancy test to confirm what she expected, Lowe said she gained weight, her periods had stopped and she began lactating towards the end of the gestation period.

When questioned about why she didn't tell anyone or seek any help, she revealed she was too shocked and too scared of what both her fiance might think and her parents.

Lowe admits to the detective that she never checked on the babies after she dumped their bodies in the laundry and didn't even look at what their sex was.

On Tuesday, two police officers choked up while testifying about how they discovered the twin boys after the father of Lindsey Lowe, 26, from , called 911 after making the grizzly discovery.

Officer Jeremy Fentress took the stand on Tuesday and described entering the bedroom of defendant Lindsey Lowe and pulling back a bloody towel.

He stopped speaking for a few seconds, then told the court: 'After I pulled the bloody towel back, I saw a deceased infant.'

Fentress said he touched the baby with two fingers and found the infant was cold and not breathing.

Scene: The newborn was the first of two found on September 14, 2011, at the two-story home in the upper-middle-class neighborhood in Hendersonville, about 20 miles northeast of Nashville

The newborn was the first of two found on September 14, 2011, in the two-story home of the upper-middle-class neighborhood in Hendersonville, about 20 miles northeast of Nashville.

The second baby was found by Sgt James Garrett, who described getting ready to lay the first baby down on a bed 'softly and gently' before he discovered the umbilical cord, still attached to something deeper in the basket.

Fentress held the body of the first baby while Garrett pulled aside a sheet to uncover the second one – who was also dead. Garrett said he placed the first baby back in the basket beside his brother.

Lowe is facing two counts of first-degree murder at her trial, which opened Monday.

Both sides in the case agree that Lowe did not act like a pregnant woman in the days and weeks leading up to the birth.

Defense attorney John Pellegrin told jurors Lowe was a bridesmaid in a wedding the weekend before the birth where she was dancing, laughing and posing for pictures.

Evidence: The video of Lowe's police interview and eventual confession was played to the court today

The night before the births, one of her sorority sisters stayed at her house, even sleeping in Lowe's bed, he said. And yet no one knew she was pregnant.

Prosecutors suggested that a lack of preparations showed Lowe never intended for the babies to live.

'Officers, during their search of the house, found no evidence of an expectation of life,' Assistant District Attorney Blanton said during opening statements.

'There were no diapers, no pacis (pacifiers), no blankets, no car seat.'

They pointed out that Lowe had been engaged to her college sweetheart in 2011, but had gotten pregnant when she had an affair with another man - who DNA tests later showed was the father of the twins.

'Miss Lowe made no preparation for the births of these children because no one was going to interfere with her life,' Blanton said in opening statements.

But defense attorneys argued that the case was not so simple.

'Lindsey Lowe was pregnant, but she refused to accept it, her mind refused to accept it,' Pellegrin said.

He argued that Lowe didn't realize what was happening when she started to give birth in the bathroom.

'She thinks her internal organs are coming out,' he told the jury.

Family, friends and church members have come to Lowe's defense.

In earlier hearings, Lowe's father Mark Lowe described her as a 'model daughter,' saying she moved back in with her family after graduating from Western Kentucky University in 2008 and took care of her mother, who had a brain tumor.

If convicted of first-degree murder, Lowe could face life in prison without parole. Prosecutors had said previously they would not seek the death penalty.
