A West Coast storm  left California to remedy landslides, flash floods, and now, a small tornado.

A tornado touched down in south Los Angeles just before 9.30am Friday causing damage to trees and roofs as residents stared incredulously at the phenomenon. 

'I’ve been here 56 years and I have never seen a tornado,' Deborah Lavergne, who worked at a nearby day care center that was damaged, told KTLA. 'It’s my first time. … It was crazy.'

The tornado was listed as an EF0, the smallest category possible, with wind speeds of 65 to 85pmh. It reportedly lasted only one minute.

No one was hurt by the small tornado that mangled a steel billboard, according to the National Weather Service, and onlookers got to experience a rare phenomenon seeing the first tornado in the city of Los Angeles since 2004, according to the U.S. Tornado's Facebook page. 

Witnesses reported seeing roofs being torn off and blown away by the wind as well as debris, trash cans, and trees being whirled around. 

The storm also caused a waterspout -- a tornado over water -- off the coast of Newport Beach. 

Damage: The tornado, with winds from 65-85mph, left sidewalks covered in branches from damaged trees

 Uprooted: Photographed, the tornado uprooted a tree in downtown LA damaging a fence and a house

The tornado is the latest in a long line of storm-related incidents occurring in California since Thursday.

The storm has been dubbed a 'Pineapple Express,' a storm fueled by a stream of tropical moisture. 

Since it's beginning, the storm has drenched northern California and given much-needed rain to southern California. 

Landslides reportedly left 10 homes uninhabitable and 13 damaged. Landslides covered some homes up to the roofs Friday. The storm has even left more than 50,000 people without electricity at one point.

RV: Photographed, an RV sits underwater from the flooded Russian River Friday in Guerneville, Calif.

The totality of the storm forced the evacuation of hundreds of homes and disrupted passenger rail services along the coast according to The Daily Republic. 

The Republic reports that one person was found dead in a flood-control channel of an Orange County town. It has not been determined if the cause of the death was storm related, but if so, it would mark the third storm-related death on the West Coast since Thursday. 

Two deaths were reported on Thursday in Oregon. Both are reportedly due to the storm, which has also affected areas of Washington.

The Weather Center reports that mudslides of land charred by recent wildfires left part of the Pacific Coast Highway blocked with 18 inches of mud.The Los Angeles Fire Department rescued two people who were swept away by the flow of the rain-swollen Los Angeles River.

Amid the harsh, weather-related incidents, the storm did bring one good thing: rain. After three years of drought, the storm gave California up to 5 inches of rain.

The Republic reports that the highest rainfall measured Friday was more than 5 inches at San Marcos Pass and downtown Los Angeles received more than 1.5 inches of rain. 

Wired reports that though the rain is appreciated, much more is needed to make up for the three-year drought that has forced cutbacks in farmer's irrigation supplies and conservation measures in California. 

Wired reports that the state would need 18-21 more inches of rain in the next six months to make up for the drought.
