A video showing half-dressed Israeli female soldiers pole dancing with a rifle has emerged, bringing further embarrassment to the army bosses.

It shows three women, one which appears in nothing but her underwear and a vest, dancing around a rifle in their army barracks.

The video follows a similar incident last week when a group of fresh recruits were reprimanded after posting semi-naked pictures on Facebook of themselves using their weapons to cover their modesty.

Exposed: The group of female recruits are dancing provocatively around a rifle in the video which has made its way onto the internet

The three women in the 30-second video are seen gyrating and dancing provocatively around a rifle which one of them is holding like a stripper's pole in the middle of the room.

The new video may be a response to the
 racy photos as one of the women can be heard saying in Hebrew that she 
will post the video on Facebook and ‘tag’ her fellow recruits in it.

Last week four Israeli female soldiers were disciplined for their 'unbecoming behaviour' after they posted raunchy pictures were posted on the social network.

The
 images, published on Israeli news website Walla, showed the soldiers 
removing their fatigues to expose their underwear and backsides.

Racy leak: The female Israeli recruits have not been identified and the army has yet to respond to the video

Soldier fashion: The 30-second video is the latest in the emerging 'trend' among female Israeli soldiers of posting pictures of themselves in compromising situations

In another, five women posed in what 
appeared to be a barracks room, dressed only in helmets and a small 
amount of combat equipment.

Walla, which blurred the faces of the women, said they were new recruits stationed on a base in southern Israel.

The
 incident is the latest in a string of episodes involving young Israeli 
soldiers on social media that have drawn reprimand from the military.

In a statement, the military said the women had acted in a manner showing 
'unbecoming behaviour' for Israeli soldiers, adding: 'The commanding 
officers disciplined the soldiers as they saw fitting.'

The statement did not identify the 
soldiers or give any details about the punishments. Military officials 
said the base conducted educational lectures to keep soldiers from 
repeating the offence.

Several
 times in recent years, the Israeli military has disciplined soldiers 
for what were considered improper postings in social media sites.

Last
 year, the social media chief for the Israel Defence Force was branded 
'racist' after posting a picture on Facebook of his face covered in mud 
alongside the caption 'Obama style'.

Lt.
 Sacha Dratwa faced a barrage of abuse for the picture, which appeared 
to show him swimming in the Dead Sea, and denied he was racist.

A male Israeli soldier was also condemned after being filmed dancing suggestively around a blindfolded Palestinian woman in a video posted to YouTube in 2010.

That incident followed the discovery 
of photos earlier that year showing a female soldier posing in front of 
Palestinian prisoners.

The Israeli military banned soldiers from using social media sites while on base after the photographs came to light.

The ban was an effort to prevent future embarrassing posts on social media. It remains unclear whether the ban is in effect.

Early
 this year, another soldier was reprimanded for writing anti-Palestinian
 tweets and posting pictures to multiple social media services showing 
himself naked with a gun.

Most Jewish Israeli men and women are required to serve in the military, starting at age 18.

In 2010, this Israeli soldier was disciplined after posting a picture of her with a blindfolded man online
