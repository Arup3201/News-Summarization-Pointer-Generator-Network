An elementary school teacher and mother-of-four was shot and killed by her estranged husband who then turned the gun on himself while she was on her way to her divorce lawyer.

Kim Conover, 43, who taught at a 
Petaluma elementary school in San Francisco, was shot by Kevin Conover, 41, outside a law office on Sunday around 2pm.

The couple had only been married two years but were former high school classmates. They had 21-month-old twins together.

Kim also leaves behind two daughters from a previous relationship who are aged 12 and 15. She had filed for a divorce from Kevin about two months ago.

A family member told the Petaluma Patch that Conover was not willing to let his wife go, had been stalking her and even turning up at her work since they had split up.

Police had been called to the home twice for domestic violence issues - once last June and once earlier this month.

No arrests were made on either occasion.

On
Monday, Kim's attorney Jeff Zimmerman revealed that she had filed for a
restraining order from her husband in Sonoma County Court which had not yet been 
approved.

In a statement issued on Monday, Kevin Conover's 
sister, Bonnie Conover Gibson, said: 'We are devastated by Sunday's 
events. Our hearts go out to (Kim Conover's family) for their senseless 
loss, especially to Kim's daughters.

'We appreciate and are eternally 
grateful for the love and support being shown in the community for all 
of us impacted by this tragedy.'

Kim Conover was a second-grade teacher at Meadow Elementary School. Principal Melissa Becker told the San Francisco Chronicle that telling the students of her death was the 'worst thing she ever had to do'.

She described the mother-of-two as an 'all-star teacher. She was the whole package.

'She was vivacious, she
was energetic, she was positive. She came to work every day with a big 
smile on her face. She's a bright light in the world.'
