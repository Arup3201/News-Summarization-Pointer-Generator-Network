Friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev arrested last week who cruised around in a car with the ‘Terrorista #1’ license plate have also been revealed to be two of the group of friends recently photographed with the Boston Marathon bomber in Times Square.

The two 19-year-old men from Kazakhstan are Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev. They were classmates of bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.

Authorities say they were detained for 
immigration violations on April 20 after being questioned in connection 
with the attack, which occurred a few days earlier.

A lawyer for one of two jailed college friends of a Boston Marathon bombing suspect say they had nothing to do with the deadly attack and had seen no hints he harbored any violent or terrorist sympathies.

Kadyrbayev's lawyer, Robert Stahl, says the students are shocked by the allegations against Tsarnaev and just want to go home.

'These kids are just as shocked and horrified about what happened as everyone else,' Stahl said.

He said they are being held for 
violating their student visas by not regularly attending classes and 
want to return to Kazakhstan as soon as possible.

Terror suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev would hang out at the their New Bedford, Mass. apartment frequently and may have stayed with them on the night of the bombing and the following night.

The two students drive a black BMW 330XI 
with the personalized plate and a sticker on the back which reads: ‘F***
 you, you f****** f****’.

Los terroristas means ‘the terrorists’ in Spanish but it's also a slang reference to 'buddies and friends.'

The pair were led out of their apartment last Friday in handcuffs before police carried out an extensive search of their home.

Federal agents first took Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev into custody April 19 and released them hours later. But they were arrested the following day on administrative immigration charges because their academic visas to attend college had expired.

They are now being held at Suffolk County House of Corrections in Boston. They have not been charged with a crime.

The April 2012 photo shows Dzhokhar posing with four pals in Times Square with four pals, including Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev. But officials had no clear idea of where the suspect was staying in the city or whether he met with anyone during the two trips.

It was revealed earlier this week that the bombers had hatched a plot to blowup Times Square after they shot and killed MIT Officer Sean Collier three days after the marathon bombing.

The brothers pair carjacked a Mercedes SUV and took its owner hostage with the intention to drive to New York. But the brothers noted the stolen vehicle was low on gas, and stopped to refuel — only for the car’s owner escape and call police.

Tamerlan, 26, died after he was riddled with bullets and run over in the ensuing mobile firefight, and Dzhokhar was arrested hiding inside a dry-docked boat in a Watertown backyard within 24 hours.
