With a kitchen crammed with Tupperware and a penchant for recycling outfits, the Queen is no stranger to thrifty living.

And it appears that the monarch has found another way to keep costs down - by eschewing expensive scented candles and scenting Buckingham Palace using reed diffusers instead.

Photos of the Queen's audiences with David Cameron reveal the presence of the diffusers, tucked away on a sideboard between porcelain ornaments and potted plants.

The diffusers, which use rattan reeds to disperse the fragrance of essential oils or perfume, last for up to four months - significantly longer than candles, which on average, burn for just 60 hours.

'Unfortunately, it's impossible to tell the brand that the Queen is using as the branding appears to have been removed,' explains perfume expert Lawrence Roullier White.

'But I'd like to think the perfect scent for her would be 'Sweet William' by British brand Urban Apothecary London.'

He added: 'While diffusers are a luxury, Her Majesty is being quite canny financially as the average scented candle will burn for 60 hrs while reed diffusers can last up to four months.'

Reed diffusers are becoming an increasingly popular way to scent the home thanks to their convenience and the ability to provide a constant source of fresh fragrance.

They also dispense with the need for flame and matches, something that Roullier White believes the new great-grandmother would appreciate.

'There's is no need for a naked flame,' he explains. 'I suspect that this is why Her Majesty has chosen a reed diffuser to scent her drawing room - there are a lot of papers on her desk and she obviously feels more comfortable.

'She's probably more sensitive to fire after the blaze at Windsor Castle during her annus horribilis.'

While
 it's not hard to find diffusers with price tags large enough to make a 
dent in even the most regal of bank balances, there are some more 
affordable options around - not least Air Wick's cheap and cheerful 
£6.99 offering.

But if 
you're looking for something a little more special, Lawrence Roullier 
White reveals how to pick the perfect diffuser for your palace.

'Individual
 scents work better in some rooms than others,' he explains. 'In the 
bathroom and kitchen, fresh, clean smells work wonderfully.

'Lemon
 or fig are great as they dispel nasty niffs, while citrus scents affect
 the brain in a positive way and make us feel happy.'

'Pungent
 perfume can be a bit overpowering in the bedroom, so try something a 
little more gentle. I love my own Clean Sheets diffuser - it smells of 
fresh linen and does seem to be the one unifying smell that everyone 
loves. 

'Rose Arbour is 
another good one as scientists have found that if you rest surrounded by
 natural floral fragrance, you'll sleep better.

'The hall and drawing room are where you'll entertain the most, so impress them with a super opulent scent. 

'I
 love Rigaud's luxury Cypress, which, admittedly in candle form, was 
used by Jackie Kennedy to fragrance the White House and by the legendary
 editor of American Vogue Diana Vreeland to scent her office.

'Choose
 something a little fresher for the dining room so it doesn't compete 
with the cuisine. Opale by Linari combines fresh lime, Asian tangerine, 
plum and green tea and is ideal for this.'
