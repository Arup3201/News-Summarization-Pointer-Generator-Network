Heavily-armed tactical squad officers in riot gear and an armoured personnel carrier descended on a home in a far western Sydney for a three hour siege, only to discover the house was empty.

Around 40 NSW police officers including members of the high-powered Tactical Operations Unit surrounded the house on a main road in the suburb of Whalan, 44km west of Sydney's central business district on Wednesday night, Channel Nine reports.

The police were called to the house following reports of shots being fired at around 2.30pm in in the driveway of another home in Kemps Creek, around 20km south of the house.

Armed and dangerous: The $200,000 bomb proof armoured personnel carrier only deployed in high risk situations arrives on the scene in Luxford Road, Whalan, in far western Sydney on Wednesday night soon after the siege begins

Stand off: Heavily armed police, including highly-trained officers from the Tactical Operations Unit are on the scene and the road is blocked off as the long wait begins while hostage-trained specialists try to coax out an 'armed gunman' from the dwelling 

Trouble in the west: Police units surrounded the house in the outer Sydney suburb of Whalan, which lies 44km west of Sydney's central business district. They were responding to reports of a shooting in the driveway of a home 20km from the Whalan house and prepared for a siege with an armed gunman

Several officers arrived at the house on Luxford Road, Whalan, in the bomb-proof raid vehicle known as BearCat.

The $400,00 vehicle is deployed only in high risk situations. Over the next three hours, officers tried to coax an 'armed gunman' out for the residence, using a megaphone and special hostage training tactics.

Getting no response, several of the armed tactical officers decided to storm the dwelling, only to discover once they were inside that no one was in the house.

Negotiation: Using a megaphone, officers pleaded with the 'gunman' to come out from the Whalan house

All bases covered: Tactical Response Unit officers holding semi-automatic weapons can be seen along the fence on one side of the besieged home during the 'negotiation' with the gunman

Storm the barricades: Getting no response after three hours surrounding the house and trying to reason with the 'gunman', the officers go in ... only to find the house empty and no sign of anyone, let alone an armed man

Detectives searched the home and the operation was called off. 

Police have now returned to the circumstances surrounding the original incident, in which a 50-year-old man was allegedly fired upon by another man, but escaped injury.
