All the action from transfer deadline day 

Crystal Palace have signed Kevin Doyle on loan from Wolves and sent Glenn Murray on loan to Reading in a double striker move on transfer deadline day.

Ireland international Doyle moves to Selhurst Park until January as Neil Warnock moves to bolster his attacking options.

Doyle became the third deadline day signing for Palace after they brought in Zeki Fryers from Tottenham and James McArthur from Wigan.

Arrival: Crystal Palace have drafted in Kevin Doyle on loan until January

Exit: Glenn Murray has left Selhurst Park to join Reading on loan until January

Murray, meanwhile, leaves the Premier League club and moves to the Madejski on a loan deal until January 1.

Murray tweeted: 'Sad to say I have left Crystal Palace but happy to announce I have joined Reading on loan with a view to permanent.'

The 31-year-old Murray moved to Palace in 2011 on a free transfer from Brighton and his goals helped them to Premier League promotion in 2013.
