The study comes 30 years after President Ronald Reagan kick started the process, making the US the world leader in missile defences

Australia has no need for a ballistic missile defence system because countries posing a threat are too far away, a new study says.

But modest investments should be made in defence system research to prepare for the future safety of the nation.

The Australian Strategic Policy Institute study also said current technology was not up to scratch and Australia should keep an eye on it as it progresses.

These measures would place the nation in a good position to adopt a ready system if it is needed later on.

The study comes 30 years after President Ronald Reagan kick started the process, making the US the world leader in missile defences.

Mr Reagan unveiled his 'star wars' vision in 1983 with the expectation that incoming ballistic missiles could be shot down with combined space and land-based missile and laser systems.

But a system capable of that is yet to come to fruition.

According to ASPI, the superpower's current land and sea-based systems would be quite effective against a limited attack by basic, short-range missiles like those possessed by North Korea and Iran.

But its system would be put under significant pressure if a mass attack occurred using longer-range missiles, with warheads that can travel up to seven kilometres a second.

The institute said the most suitable system relevant to Australia's threats was the US Aegis ballistic missile defence system on board some US and Japanese warships -Â  tipped for the nation's new air warfare destroyers.

Right now ballistic missile defence system technology not up to scratch

Not even the US could defend itself with its system if a major threat came

Best missile technology for Australia exists on US and Japanese warships
