Joe Root ensured there was no repeat of England's bad habits and old frailties as they took a giant step towards a series victory over India on day two of the fifth Investec Test.

Root's unbeaten 92, a triumph of calm and then acceleration in stands of 80 with Jos Buttler and an unbroken 67 in only 10 overs with Chris Jordan, meant the hosts could quickly forget about their mini-collapse of three wickets for 13 runs.

So close: England captain Alastair Cook missed out on an elusive century despite two reprieves

They were able to close on 385 for seven, with a lead of 237 and power still to add at The Oval - where captain Alastair Cook (79) and Gary Ballance (64) also contributed half-centuries.

Second-wicket pair Cook and Ballance were part of that mid-afternoon wobble, after a partnership of 125, leaving Root and Buttler to put things right.

Root especially did so to great effect, needing 93 balls for his fifth 50 of this series but then taking toll of a flagging attack as he hit seven more boundaries from only another 36 deliveries.

Ballance had lavish praise for his fellow Yorkshire batsman, and pointed out too that England of the recent past might easily have gone into terminal decline - as they did so often in last winter's Ashes and on several occasions this summer too - once wickets began to tumble.

'It was a bit of a wobble, a bit of a collapse - which is not ideal,' he said.

'Early on in the summer, it could have been an eight or nine-wicket collapse - but it was only four.

'They bowled well at us and got a few wickets, but the way Rooty and Jos counter-attacked was brilliant ... and really put us in a strong position.'

Barring a major recovery of the tourists' composure after two successive defeats already, England ought to convert their mid-match advantage into a 3-1 series win - and Root once more has played a significant part.

'He's played very positively,' added Ballance.

'He was patient, and got used to the pace of the wicket and then looked to score (more quickly) - and that's what he's done very well this summer.

'He's obviously got that ability (to change gear in an innings), and today he had a chance to put pressure back on India and did that very well and scored very quickly.

'To watch how he's handled it after a tough tour of Australia and come back this summer and scored big, big runs - when the team needed them - just shows he's a quality player.'

India off-spinner Ravi Ashwin has been impressed too by Root's energetic yet controlled approach to batting.

'He's a positive player, and is expressing himself more - for whatever reason.

'He's a hard competitor who I'd love to compete against every time I go out.'

Ballance, meanwhile, was able to reflect with satisfaction on another 50 - his sixth in 11 innings this summer - from the number three position previously filled so well for so long by Jonathan Trott.

'I hadn't batted much there before, but I've had a few gos this summer and feel quite good there now,' said the successful new incumbent.

'Trotty's shoes are massive to fill. He did so well over five or six years, and scored huge runs...but I hope I can look at what he did well, and try to replicate that.'

Ballance appeared to have a fourth century in his sights in only his eighth Test, before an unusually tame dismissal to Ashwin.

'I was very disappointed to get out when I did. I thought I had a good chance to get a hundred there.

'You don't want to say you feel at home, because it's international sport and it's tough.

'(But) I feel much more confident after this summer, and feel like I can do a decent job and kick on, have a decent career and put England in winning positions.
