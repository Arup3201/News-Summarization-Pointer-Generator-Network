It may seem unlikely, but the humble rabbit helped kill off the Neanderthals, researchers have claimed.

Experts have long thought that the demise of the Neanderthal was down to food.

Now a new theory claims that it was their inability to adapt to hunting small animals like rabbits that was the final nail in their coffin.

Is this what killed the Neanderthals? Researchers believe an inability to hunt small animals like rabbits led to their demise

John Fa, of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust in Jersey, counted
 the skeletons of animals found in three excavation sites in Spain and 
southern France.

The remains of large animals such as deer that had been 
dated as far back as 30,000 years ago were abundant in caves.

But from then on, coinciding with the 
disappearance of Neanderthals, rabbit remains became more prevalent.

As deer ran out, experts believe the Neanderthals were unable to learn how to hunt small animals, and died out as modern man was better able to adapt

The
 authors believe that humans were more successful at switching to 
catching and eating rabbits.

'High dependence on the hunting and consumption of large mammals by 
some hominins may have limited their survival once their preferred 
quarry became scarce or disappeared,' he wrote.Â 

'Adaptation to smaller residual prey would have been essential after the many large-bodied species decreased in numbers.'

The researchers focused on the rabbit, described as a 'super-abundant species'.

'Analysis of bone remains from excavations throughout Iberia show 
that this lagomorph was a crucial part of the diet of Anatomically 
Modern Humans but was relatively unutilised during the Mousterian, when 
Neanderthals were present,' they found.

'We suggest that hunters that could shift focus to rabbits and other 
smaller residual fauna, once larger-bodied species decreased in numbers,
 would have been able to persist.'

However, the team admit it is not clear why Neanderthals would have had more trouble changing prey.

Some believe they may have been less able to cooperate.

Rather
 than using spears, early humans probably surrounded a warren and 
flushed out rabbits with fire, smoke or dogs, it is believed.

Neanderthals and the ancestors of 
modern humans never co-existed, according to a recent study which, if 
correct, could rewrite conventional accounts of our species' early 
history.

The study suggests 
that our evolutionary cousins became extinct in their last refuge in 
Spain much earlier than previously thought.

Previous dating of bone fossils found at Neanderthal sites in the region put the youngest at about 35,000 years.

Now
 researchers from Australia and Europe have re-examined the bones using 
an improved method to filter out contamination and concluded that the 
remains are actually about 15,000 years older.

If
 true, the study casts doubt on the idea that modern humans and 
Neanderthals co-existed - and possibly even interbred - for millennia.

Humans
 aren't believed to have settled in the region until 42,000 years ago, 
but the new dating has neanderthals disappearing from there around 
50,000 years ago.

'The 
results of our study suggest that there are major problems with the 
dating of the last Neanderthals in modern-day Spain,' said Thomas 
Higham, deputy director of the Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit at Oxford 
University.

'It is unlikely that Neanderthals survived any later in this area than they did elsewhere in mainland Europe.'
