Disgraced NFL player Aaron Hernandez was 'apparently high' before he allegedly executed his former friend, MailOnline can reveal today.

Prosecutors plan to introduce evidence that includes security surveillance video taken at the gas 
station where Hernandez bought a cigar and bubble gum twenty minutes 
before he picked up Odin Lloyd.

Lloyd, 27, a semi-professional football player, who would be found dead later that same 
day in an industrial park close to the former football star's mansion in North Attleborough, Massachussetts.

'High': Hernandez is alleged to have been caught on surveillance camera dancing in the headlights of his car while 'apparently high' when he stopped at a gas station to buy a 'cigar and gum' before he picked up Lloyd

Investigative sources told MailOnline that Hernandez, pictured here with Snoop Dogg, was a heavy user of PCP, alcohol and hydroponic marijuana

'He danced in his own headlights for so long the gas station attendant turned off the outside lights to get rid of him,' said a high-ranking law enforcement source. 'He was apparently high, or very much appeared to be.'

Bristol County prosecutor Sam Sutter would not comment on specific video, but court records filed by investigators in the case state that video shows Hernandez stopped at the Blue Hill Express Service Station at 2.09 am on June 17 last year and purchased a 'cigar and Bubble Yum cotton candy flavored gum'.

Investigative sources told MailOnline that Hernandez was a heavy user of PCP, alcohol and hydroponic marijuana.

A manager at the Blue Hill Express Service Station who asked not to be identified confirmed the dancing video, and said all of the security footage had been turned over to investigators.

Ernest Wallace, 41, is charged with being an accessory after the fact of murder in connection with Lloyd’s death. Wallace, a Bristol, Connecticut native, was living in Hernandez’s home, prosecutors said.

Another man, Carlos Ortiz, is also charged as an accessory but is not expected to testify against Hernandez because his story has changed, investigators told MailOnline.

Meanwhile, Hernandez has also been identified by prosecutors and in court documents as a suspect in another drive-by shooting in Boston that left two men dead and another wounded in July 2012.

MailOnline has learned that then New England Patriots tight end has been identified 
as the shooter both by his passenger in a rented SUV and the survivor of
 the triple shooting, according to sources familiar with grand jury 
testimony.

Suffolk County prosecutors have acknowledged there is a grand jury 
inquiry into the July 2012 shooting after a car believed to have been 
used in that drive-by was recovered.

It was found in a Bristol, Connecticut, garage 
owned by Hernandez’s uncle, according to a search warrant 
affidavit filed in the case.

According to sources, less than five minutes before the shots rang 
out Hernandez was captured by a security 
surveillance camera driving a gray SUV with Rhode Island license plates 
out of a parking garage near the Boston nightclub Cure – the same club 
where the shooting victims were partying earlier in the night.

In the passenger 
seat of the rented SUV was Alexander Bradley – who 
was forced to testify in front of the grand jury after he was arrested 
as a fugitive from justice.

Bradley is the same man who filed a lawsuit 
this year claiming Hernandez shot him in the face in Florida last 
January and blew out his eye after they partied with friends at a strip 
club. 

Bradley 
testified that Hernandez was the gunman in the July 2012 Boston fatal 
drive-by shooting, several sources said – a claim that was corroborated 
by the sole survivor. 

Hernandez was also captured on security 
cameras at the Cure nightclub arguing with the victims and a club 
employee told investigators he saw the then-Patriots player carry a gun 
into the establishment, according to court documents.  

Guns: Investigators are also working with ATF agents who have launched a federal probe into weapons found at Hernandez's home. He was captured holding a pistol on his own security cameras

'The 
witness stated that he didn’t know Hernandez from the Patriots but 
recognized his face after his arrest in the Odin Lloyd case,'’ a 
high-ranking law enforcement official told MailOnline.

Separately, investigators are also working alongside ATF agents who have launched a federal probe into the weapons found at Hernandez’s home, several sources said.

They added that one of those guns was the pistol Hernandez was captured holding on his own security cameras that emerged after his arrest for Lloyd's murder.

At a status conference hearing 
in open court last week, Bristol County prosecutors acknowledged there 
was a separate investigation into Hernandez being conducted by a 'national agency'. 

Hernandez was arrested on June 26 and has been held without bail since. His fiancé and mother of his toddler daughter, Shayana Jenkins, has also been charged with perjury in the case. His cousin, Tanya Singleton, was also charged with obstruction of justice.

Implicated: Alexander Bradley, who claims Hernandez blew out his eye, above, has allegedly testified to a grand jury that Hernandez was the gunman in a separate fatal drive-by in Boston in 2012

Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley – who is investigating the Boston allegations – declined to comment on the startling new evidence against Hernandez evidence through his spokesman Jake Wark. 'We have no comment on the ongoing grand jury proceedings,' Wark said.

Hernandez was in court last week, where a judge denied the prosecution’s request for official copies of jailhouse phone calls that they allege the former NFL star used to discuss murder in code. He has been allowed to read a book provided by jail officials: 'Tuesdays With Morrie.'
