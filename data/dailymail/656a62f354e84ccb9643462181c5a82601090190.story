David Cameron has distanced himself from Prince Andrew by refusing to publicly back the royal over allegations that he sexually abused a teenager.

Asked about the claims, which were made against the Duke of York last week, the Prime Minister replied: 'I'm not going to make any comment on it.

'Obviously, the Prince has made his own views very, very clear, and I think I'll leave it at that.'

It came as veteran Labour MP Paul Flynn, who sits on the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the royal still had questions to answer.

Mr Flynn told The Daily Mirror: 'Prince Andrew must not be above the law. He has been unwise generally in his choice of friends and exposed himself to public suspicion.

'He should have broke any links with a convicted child sex offender.' 

Mr Cameron's comments, made during a radio interview yesterday, showed a marked change from his reaction when the Duke's friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein first caused controversy in 2011.

At the time, Mr Cameron's spokesman said the Duke was 'doing an important job' and that 'we support him in his role as trade envoy'.

Despite the backing, the Duke ultimately resigned as Special Representative for UK Trade and Investment. 

In court papers which emerged on Friday, Andrew has been accused of abusing a girl 'procured' for him by his close friend Epstein.

The extraordinary allegation was made by Virginia Roberts as part of a US civil case against shamed billionaire Epstein. 

She claims Prince Andrew had sex with her when she was 17 - a minor under US law - and employed as a 'sex slave' by Epstein.

Buckingham Palace has strenuously denied the allegations in three statements.  

Yesterday, Boris Johnson gave the Duke his support, saying he had 'sympathy' for the father-of-two.

Speaking on LBC radio, he said: 'Prince Andrew, let's be very clear, is a guy who does a huge amount of unsung, unheralded work for this country.

'People, they go on and and about the air miles and so on, actually I have seen that guy get out there and sell this country, try and help British firms to get business around the world.

'He does a huge amount of good and a huge amount of hard work. So if you are asking me whether I have sympathy for him, of course I do.'

Mr Johnson added: 'We may think it's bizarre, but somebody who is the second son of the Queen is felt in many parts of the world to be an interesting and significant figure and they will receive him cordially and people who come with him they want to hear what business suggestions they have.

'So I think that people should respect that side of his work.'  

Sarah Ferguson has already launched an extraordinary defence of her former husband Prince Andrew, describing him as 'the greatest man there is'.

The Duchess of York declined to comment directly on the scandal engulfing her former husband.

But, when asked by the Daily Mail if she was sticking by the Duke, she replied: 'The York family is a tight unit. We've always been a tight unit.

'He is the greatest man there is. It was the finest moment of my life in 1986 when I married him. He is a great man, the best man in the world.' 

Andrew, who spent last week holidaying in a chalet in Verbier the chalet, flew back to the UK by private jet on Sunday afternoon with Eugenie.

Sources say there are no immediate plans for him to travel to Norfolk, where the Queen is in residence until early February. However, it was indicated they had spoken by phone.
