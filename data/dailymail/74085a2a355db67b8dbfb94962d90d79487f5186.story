When it comes to drinks it's fair to say that Scotland is perhaps better known for beverages such as Irn-Bru or whisky.

But a tea-plantation nestled in the foothills of the Scottish Highlands on Dalreoch Farm Estate in Highland Perthshire, has become the largest of its kind in the UK after discovering the perfect recipe for tea.

The business is the brainchild of Jamie Russell, 36, Derek Walker, 39, and Tam O'Brann, 44, who set up 'The Wee Tea Company' after meeting in a pop-up shop in Dunfermline.

They company say they benefit from the mountain air and fresh spring water unique to Scotland and are already farming over 2,000 tea plants

The trio behind the company insist there is no reason why they can't grow the same crops more commonly found in the planet's most humid climates.

The award-winning team say they benefit 
from the mountain air and fresh spring water unique to Scotland and are 
already farming over 2,000 tea plants to make a flawless cuppa.

The tea is grown at 230 metres above sea level and the team hopes to be operating to full capacity within two years. They plan to cultivate more than 14,000 individual plants, making the chilly district Europe's biggest tea grower.

A spokesman for the company said: 'The plants we are growing will produce leaves for 30-90 years.

With the right technology and a bit of common sense growing tea in Scotland is possible.

'There is nothing to stop people growing their own tea plants, it's just about getting the conditions right.

'By growing plants at the foot of the Scottish Highlands camellia sinensis benefit from the clean mountain air, altitude and fresh spring water unique to Scotland.

'We also utilise cutting edge agronomy techniques from Australasia, the Americas and Scandinavia.

The Wee Tea Company will be competing with the world's main tea-growing regions, India, China, Japan and Taiwan, but with over 165 million cups of tea drank every day in Britain alone, the market is hardly saturated.

The team want to change the current cafe culture where a good cup of coffee is easy to find but tea devotees struggle to get anything more than hot water and a teabag

Their range of blends are available to buy in outlets and from the company website, their own 100 per cent Scottish tea blend, to be called 'Dalreoch', will also soon be available to buy

Their ultimate goal is to target markets across North America and Asia who they say are 'crying out' for a fresh tea product.

The spokesman added: 'Our tea is an affordable luxury, and we truly believe that if people want to enjoy our tea, they can do so within the comforts of their own home, their favourite café or deli.

'And despite the harsh winter period above the border, the trio insist there is no reason why they can't grow the same crops more commonly found in the planet's most humid climates.

The spokesman said: 'Protecting against high winds or frost, development of the plants root system and maximising the known seasons of high growth are key to our success in these beautiful surroundings.

'We don't use petrochemical-based pesticide meaning airborne insects are discouraged from planting eggs on our crops through reflected sunlight.

'Using degradable polymers around the plant, we reflect the sun's own goodness upwards, doubling the effect of Scottish sunshine but also reducing the shade these critters prefer.

'The same degradable membrane traps the heat already within our soil and heightens humidity while reducing the need for any secondary watering.

'For water we draw our own mountain spring and reservoir reserves for any unduly dry spells.

'All in all we're using the best of what Scotland has to offer.'
