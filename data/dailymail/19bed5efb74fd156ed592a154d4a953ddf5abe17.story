Premier League viewing figures may be growing worldwide, but the likes of Wayne Rooney, Sergio Aguero and Eden Hazard are catching the imagination of the US nation in particular.

A total of 115.5 million Americans watched live English top-flight football last season - that is an increase of 114 per cent on the previous campaign.

And England's top clubs are not alien to the fact that the American 'soccer' market is booming right now.

Nigeria - 89.6m (39% up)

South Africa - 43.9m (23% up)

Malaysia - 23.6m (21% up)

Nine Premier League teams - including Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal - jetted off on lucrative pre-season tours around the US in an attempt to tap into the growing market.

Louis van Gaal's United side even played in front of a sell-out 109,000 crowd against Real Madrid at the Michigan Stadium, highlighting the enthusiasm for the game that is growing in America.

World Cup fever also engrossed the United States as the nation threw their support behind their soccer team as they reached the last 16, only to succumb to a 2-1 defeat after extra-time to Belgium.

Thousands of fans lined the streets in cities including Chicago, New York and Miami - as well as in numerous fan parks around the country - to cheer on their side during the tournament.

A pre-tournament survey carried out across 19 Brazil-bound countries also found that US fans expected their side to win the World Cup, showing their excitement ahead of the showpiece event.

It is not just in the US where the Premier League's appeal is growing, however.

Live viewing figures in Hong Kong rose by 76 per cent last season, in Nigeria by 39 per cent, in South Africa 23 per cent and in Malaysia 21 per cent.

But it is the United States that is the fastest growing market for the Premier League - and for football in general - right now. England's top clubs are keen to ride on the crest of a wave and capitalise on America's continuing conversion to the round ball game.
