The graves of the six Philpott children killed by their parents in a house fire have finally been given headstones more than a year after they died.

Jade Philpott, 10, and her brothers 
Duwayne, 13, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six and Jayden, five, died 
from the effects of smoke inhalation following the fire in May last year.

The local community raised the funds for the marble gravestones at the city’s Nottingham Road Cemetery.

Fitting tribute: The graves of the six Philpott children killed by their parents in a house fire have finally been given headstones more than a year after they died. Left, the grave of Jayden, 5, and right, Jack, 8

The five boys have a picture of Derby County player drawn into the first letter of their name, while Jade, aged 10,  left,  has a fairy.  Right, Duwayne, the eldest died aged 13 in the fire

Their grandmother Peggy Philpott, 86, said of the memorials: 'They’re beautiful. I just wish they weren’t here,' reported The Sun.

Grandfather Jim
Duffy, 64, added: 'The last 12 to 15 months have been a nightmare so 
seeing the headstones here finally is a great relief. They’re a real 
tribute.'

The five boys' names, engraved in blue, have a picture of Derby County player drawn into the first letter of their name, while Jade has a fairy next to the pink engravings.

Killers: Mick and Mairead Philpott are currently serving prison sentences for the manslaughter of six of their children in a house fire

Philpott started the blaze with the help of wife Mairead and friend Paul Mosley while their six children were sleeping upstairs in May last year.

They had hatched an elaborate plot in which Mick would save the children and the fire would be blamed on his estranged partner Lisa Willis.

Philpott was locked in a legal battle with her for custody of the four children they had together.

The trio were all found guilty of killing the children in the fire at their home in Victory Road, Allenton, Derby, in the early hours of May 11 last year.

They made a despicable gamble to start the fire and blame Miss Willis in a bid to win back custody of five children she took from the family home.

But the idiotic plan went disastrously wrong.

Too much petrol was used and the fire burned out of control – leaving Philpott unable to reach the children in temperatures approaching 1,000F.

The judge described the plot as 'a wicked and dangerous plan' that was 'outside the comprehension of any right-thinking person'.

In the days that followed the fire, Philpott began his elaborate ruse to appear blameless and even appeared at a press conference appealing for information.

He ‘loved’ being a local celebrity and was seen 'laughing and joking' and ‘touching up’ his wife in the hospital where her son Duwayne was dying after the fire.

Then, while in custody awaiting trial, he wrote a sick prison letter boasting that if he won freedom he and his wife would celebrate by ‘raping each other’.

The cramped three-bedroom semi-detached home in Derby was shared by Mick Philpott, his wife, mistress and all 11 children he had with both women

The note to friends detailed how he planned to get blind drunk and commit the assault straight after visiting the graves of the children he and Mairead had killed.

Mick
was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum 15 year term. Mairead 
and Mosley were jailed for 17 years for manslaughter and must serve at 
least half their sentence.

The judge said there was 'no precedent' for the case, describing it as a 'uniquely grave set of offences'.
