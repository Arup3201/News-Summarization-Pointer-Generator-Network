Philippe Coutinho is hoping his form for Liverpool will help him maintain his place in the Brazil squad following World Cup heartbreak.

The midfielder was left out  by Luiz Felipe Scolari last summer as his national side fell at the semi-final stage against eventual champions Germany on home turf.

But  Coutinho has been selected in every squad since,  as returning boss Dunga continues his shake-up in an attempt to return Brazil to their former standing in the world game.

The Liverpool midfielder was omitted from the 23-man World Cup squad last summer

The 22-year-old has appeared from the bench four times in the seven games since, but was an unused substitute as Brazil beat France 3-1 in Paris on Thursday night. 

'Whenever I'm called up, it's like the first time,' Coutinho told an LFCTV documentary.

'It's a great honour to wear the Brazilian shirt, which thousands of people dream of wearing one day. I want to honour it whenever I have the opportunity. It means a lot to me.

'I believe being in the team is a dream for every player. You can represent your country. It is a very young squad, so just by having a chance it's a special moment for me.

'My goal is to look for my own space. I believe that is everybody's goal. I know we have other great players, players who have had a great impact on the team. I'm looking for my chance slowly.'

Coutinho had won just a single cap heading into last summer's World Cup, but his form for Liverpool as they finished second in the Premier League gave him an outside hope of a call-up.

But Scolari elected to omit him, meaning Coutinho missed the once-in-a-lifetime chance of playing in a home World Cup.

'I know that was the only opportunity I had to play at the World Cup in my country,' he continued.

'Whether I should have been called up is a bit complicated to say. I'd rather think about the present and make things happen in the future.

'I won't have that opportunity again, so I should use it all on the field, doing what I'm demanded to do in my position, what a midfielder must do, to be on the list for the next World Cup.'
