The male in question has been described as a cheery chap wearing a blue jacket and red hat with a ‘smiley and hairy expression’.

But this is no ordinary missing persons case - because police are investigating the overnight theft of a 3ft garden gnome from a pensioner’s ornamental front path.

Stanley Hall, 81, had placed the giant gnome named ‘Happy Harry’ beside the doorstep alongside scores of other ornaments to cheer up his neighbours in Accrington, Lancashire.

However the widower was shocked to wake 
up one morning to find the £25 statuette had gone missing - and called 
in police. It is thought the gnome may have been taken for a prank or to
 sell on.

Retired engineer Mr Hall said: ‘I can’t believe that someone would do this - and I can only presume that whoever has done this have planned it in advance.

‘I can’t imagine that they would want to walk through a town centre carrying a giant gnome. I just don’t know why they would steal him. If it was youngsters perhaps it was for a joke or prank.

‘If someone older, perhaps there is a black market for these things but why risk selling Harry off for a tenner and perhaps face the courts if they get found out?’

Plea: Stanley Hall, 81, is pictured outside his home in Accrington with a sign made by a local woman saying: 'Hello, I'm Happy Harry, welcome to my garden'

‘One of my neighbours was so upset at the theft she actually rang the police before me. They were so upset. We are quite a tight-knit group here.

'Perhaps there is a black market for these things but why risk selling Harry off for a tenner and perhaps face the courts if they get found out?'

‘The thing is we never have any trouble around here because everyone is elderly. I just want these people to bring Harry home.

‘I don’t need to speak to them - they can just bring it back during the evening when it is dark and that will be the end of it.’

Mr Hall bought the gnome last March from a local supermarket to add to his 100-strong collection of ornamental dragons, pandas, dogs, trolls and Buddha figures.

He added: ‘I collect ornaments for the simple reason that there are a lot of elderly people around here. There are at least four people in their 90s and three in their 80s.

‘It makes them smile every time they walk past and look at my front door and see all my gnomes - especially “Happy Harry” smiling back at them.

‘One of the ladies here even made a sign saying “Hello, I’m Happy Harry, welcome to my garden.” That is the whole point of it. They come past and they always have a smile for him.

‘Happy Harry waves and sometimes you see them wave back as the go by. Since my wife died three years ago, I didn’t have to answer to anyone querying what I buy.

Plea: Lancashire Constabulary urged anyone with information about who is responsible to contact the force

‘My eldest daughter often comes in and says: “What have you bought now?” I say: “Did you see my two new gnomes looking out the window at you?” She just laughs and that is what it is all about.

'We are aware of the incident and we are investigating. I urge anyone with information about who is responsible to contact us'

Lancashire Constabulary spokesman

‘Harry just makes me smile and is one of 100 ornaments. I noticed he was missing on Saturday morning. I opened the door and thought something was wrong here and realised he wasn’t there.

‘I just felt sorry for people who have to steal things like that. I want Happy Harry back, not for me but for the people. When they come past, they got used to seeing him.

‘It’s like having a missing person in the area. I will get another gnome but it won’t be the same and it looks like I will have to chain him up.’

A Lancashire Constabulary spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the incident and we are investigating. I urge anyone with information about who is responsible to contact us.’
