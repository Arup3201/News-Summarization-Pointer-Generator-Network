Traditional families with married parents and two children are a thing of the past and 'patchwork' families should be celebrated, a leading Catholic theologian has claimed.

Werner Jeanrond, a former pupil of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, said the Church must drop 'moralising statements' about the ideal family set-up and embrace single working parents.

His words come as the Coalition announced tax breaks for working mothers worth up to £2,000 a year for every child under 12.

Embrace alternatives: Professor Jeanrond claims the 'idol' of married parents with two children is a construct of the industrialised West

Change: Professor Werner Jeanrond claims the early Church would not recognise 'traditional' family units

The state-backed childcare package 
released in last week's Budget came under fire from Tory MPs claiming 
'traditional families' with a stay-at-home parent are put at a 
disadvantage.

But Professor 
Jeanrond, Master of St Benet's Hall at the University of Oxford, 
welcomed the idea of a broader definition of 'family'.

He branded nuclear families 'an idol of the modern industrialised west', which the early Church would find bizarre.

'Biblical
 concepts of the family often transcend biological considerations and 
refer to larger households which can include relatives of different 
degrees, an intergenerational community, visitors, and 
workers/helpers/slaves,' he told MailOnline.

'All
 too often the increasing numbers of people who live alone are not at 
all present in the — at times — too many and too much moralising 
statements on the 'Christian' family.'

He added: 'Our so-called patchwork families ought to be of interest to a Church so used to changing concepts of family.

'It
 is the attention to Jesus Christ that unites a Christian family, not 
the adherence to shifting codifications of its boundary.'

Professor Jeanrond is Master of St Benet's Hall, University of Oxford, which has just decided to admit female undergraduates, and is a former pupil of Pope Benedict, who many say left an overlooked progressive legacy

Laura Perrins, of campaign group Mothers at Home Matter, said: ‘It’s a disgrace that taxpayers’ money will be used to contribute to the childcare bill of families earning up to £300,000. The Old Etonians need to take a trip to reality street.’

The Government insisted it is taking various steps to provide support for stay-at-home parents – including a new universal state pension crediting years spent caring for children and a transferable marriage tax allowance to be introduced from next year.

But that will be worth just £200 a year, to the dismay of Tory critics.

Former children’s minister Tim Loughton said: ‘The state is disproportionately geared up to pushing parents into being working parents.’
