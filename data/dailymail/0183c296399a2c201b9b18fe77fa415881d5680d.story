Ambition: Unite leader Len McCluskey told Newsnight he feels union influence on Labour is imperative

Ed Miliband's controversial reform of Labour's structures will allow the unions to tighten their grip on the party, Len McCluskey boasted last night.

Mr McCluskey, militant boss of the giant Unite union, said he 'certainly' expected to emerge with more power from a set of reforms that are meant to convince voters that Labour is not simply doing the bidding of its union paymasters.

Mr Miliband pledged to shake up Labour's links with the unions last year in the wake of the Falkirk vote-rigging scandal, when Unite was accused of trying to fix the selection of a new candidate for the safe Labour seat.

A watered-down package of reforms is set to be rubber-stamped by party chiefs at a special conference this weekend, although they will not be phased in programme fully for five years.

But Mr McCluskey told the BBC's Newsnight that he expected the reforms to give the unions 'more influence' in the running of the party than they have already.

Asked if Unite could emerge with more power, he said: 'We certainly could, if we work hard enough, and Unite intends to, we intend to go out and persuade our members actively to a whole host of different mediums to join the Labour Party... because of course we believe that in recent years the party has lost the values that trades unionists bring to the party and we want to have more influence in the party.'

He said it was now 'central to Unite's political strategy' to persuade activists to sign up for a new category of 'affiliate' membership of Labour, which will give them full voting rights on a par with MPs in leadership elections.

The intervention is deeply unhelpful for Mr Miliband, who has repeatedly denied Tory claims that his reforms are a sham that will increase the influence of the unions rather than curb it.

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps last night seized on Mr McCluskey's comments as evidence that the reforms would have little more than a cosmetic impact.

'The unions still dictate Labour's policy, push the leader around and choose the candidates,' Mr Shapps said.

'Ed Miliband is too weak to stand up to his union paymasters and therefore will never be able to stand up for the hardworking people of Britain.'

His words come as Labour party leaders, such as Miliband and Harman, intend to show their distance

Concerns: McCluskey said he feels talk of a Lib/Lab coalition shows the party is losing its roots

In a further flexing of muscles, Mr McCluskey also warned Mr Miliband to rule out a post-election coalition with the Liberal Democrats.

Mr McCluskey, whose union is Labour's biggest donor, said: 'One of the things that people are looking for is something different and I'm afraid that the reason why politicians are not particularly popular at the moment is people don't see any differences so I think they're looking for people who have courage of their convictions.

'Labour, I hope, win the next election outright, but if they are the biggest party then my view is Ed should have the courage of his convictions and govern on a minority government.

'The real test comes in 2015 when the British people have chosen, and my advice, my view is that Ed shouldn't be sucked into a Lib/Lab pact, he should have the courage of his convictions if we are the largest party, he should govern.

'And he should challenge those coalition parties to bring him down if necessary and go back to the people so that there's a stark alternative.'

His comments come amid reports that David Cameron is preparing to rule out a future coalition with Nick Clegg.
