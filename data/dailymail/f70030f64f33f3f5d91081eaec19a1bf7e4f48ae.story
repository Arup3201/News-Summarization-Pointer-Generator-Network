A newlywed couple were so determined to have the ultimate set of wedding photographs they travelled to Antarctica - so they could pose up with penguins in their natural habitat.

And the bride even wore her strapless dress in the sub-zero temperatures, while her groom wore – what else? – a penguin suit!

But the Chinese couple’s antics have brought anything but best wishes back in their homeland, where their behaviour has been deemed an embarrassment, according to the People’s Daily.

Snow regrets: The couple had the time of their lives - but these photos prompted frustration back home

The nation is acutely aware of its reputation for tourists behaving badly abroad and anything that can be seen to reinforce the stereotype is often widely condemned.

With a rapidly-growing wealthy elite, China already sends more tourists to Antarctica than any country in the world apart from the U.S. and Australia. 

According to International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, 37 Chinese tourists visited the continent between 2003 and 2004.

Ten years later that number had exploded to 3,328.

This group was spotted by a Chinese photographer who traveled to the untouched wilderness on assignment - and he found them chasing penguins and jumping into groups of the birds.

Irresponsible? Chinese citizens are keen to avoid anything that paints them as reckless eco-tourists

Internet users in China reacted angrily, with some suggesting the next stop would be taking inappropriate pictures on Mars. 

A photographer from Chinanews.com took pictures of some Chinese tourists exhibiting what he described as 'pitiful behaviour'.

The photographer claimed that the 'uncivilised phenomenon happened constantly'.

'Some Chinese tourists seem to enjoy themselves too much so that they chase penguins and run into crowds of the animal for pictures,' the photographer added.

'There were even tourists who ignore rules and took pictures of penguins very closely.'
