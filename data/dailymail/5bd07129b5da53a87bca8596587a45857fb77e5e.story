Team news

Derby

Jake Buxton is likely to partner Richard Keogh in defence for Derby's Capital One Cup quarter-final with Chelsea.

Ryan Shotton is suspended after being sent off in their 2-0 defeat by Middlesbrough on Saturday, when Buxton was an unused substitute, while Zak Whitbread has been struggling with back and hamstring problems.

Jamie Ward is out with a thigh injury and the Rams are waiting for the results of a scan the Northern Ireland international had on Monday.

Provisional squad: Grant, Roos, Christie, Keogh, Buxton, Forsyth, Hendrick, Eustace, Hughes, Coutts, Mascarell, Bryson, Calero, Santos, Russell, Martin, Best, Ibe, Dawkins

Chelsea

Playmaker Cesc Fabregas is available following suspension as Chelsea travel to Derby for their Capital One Cup quarter-final clash on Tuesday night.

Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is unlikely to be risked after missing the Premier League leaders' win over Hull with a minor muscular injury, so Petr Cech is poised to continue in goal.
