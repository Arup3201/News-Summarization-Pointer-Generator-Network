The New York Daily News reports that Pena, Gil, and Campbell were each charged with misdemeanor assault and disorderly conduct while Howard was charged with felony assault using a weapon. 

In the footage, Howard can be seen taunting Pena on the Washington Square station-bound F train, when she is slapped so hard she was almost knocked over.

Another man jumped to her defense as scenes descended into chaos with the men raining punches down on each other. 

Howard and Pena were reportedly both arrested at the W. 4th St. subway station at about 5 a.m. Saturday along with Howard's friends Kevin Gil, 21, and Shanique Campbell, 20

The incident was captured on camera and has since gone viral, according to the New York Daily News.

The undated footage, which was uploaded to YouTube on Saturday, has already had more than 1.5 million views.

It shows Howard on the train with her friends telling Pena, who is wearing a leather 8 ball jacket and fur hat, to stay away before she starts to insult his clothing.

Her friends egg her on and clap as she throws insults at the unnamed man, who nods and smiles at her.

Howard tells Pena: 'You got a dumb*** 8 ball jacket that came out in the 1990s.'

As she is holding a pair of high-heeled snake skin boots she says: ‘I’m done. You wanna know what shoes I’ve got on? They’re Steve Madden ones, alright?’ before sitting down.

She was insulting his dress sense and told him 'You got a dumb*** 8 ball jacket that came out in the 1990s'

The young woman's friends jump up when they see that another passenger is recording the argument 

Her attention is then drawn to the man filming the incident after he tells her: ‘Nobody wears Steve Madden no more,’ and her friends jump up and charge towards him asking him what he is doing.

He backs off but Howard knocks the phone from his hand – sending it flying to the ground but it is still recording and he tells her ‘you’re petty as hell – you can’t even afford this.’

The man picks it up but she knocks it from his hands again before continuing her attack on Pena.

'You sound stupid,' she shouts at him from behind before hitting him on the back of his head with her boot.

Howard continues to taunt Pena by telling him he sounds stupid before she hits him on the back of his head

A man steps in in an attempt to break up the fight but is unsuccessful and also ends up in the middle of the fight

He then swiftly turns round and slaps her hard across the cheek, creating a loud smacking noise.

The girl's friend jumps in and the situation quickly spirals out of control with several people trying to hit each other, while the cameraman screams in excitement.

Another man steps in to break up the fight and eventually two of the men are separated. 

The video, titled 'Man smacks the soul out of girl on the NY Subway', has since gone viral and even led to remixed versions online.
