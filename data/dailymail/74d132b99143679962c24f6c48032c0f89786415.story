Leicester midfielder Andy King celebrated his 26th birthday by signing a new four-year contract at the club.

King joined Leicester in 2004 and rose through the youth ranks before making his full debut in 2007.

The Wales international, who has played six Barclays Premier League games this season, has penned a new deal until the summer of 2018 and he hopes to see out the rest of his career at the King Power Stadium.

'To be able to commit my future and for the club to have shown this sort of faith in me is a massive boost so I'm just looking to kick on now,' King, who has played 283 times for Leicester, told the club's official website.

'I've only ever played for Leicester City and it's looking more and more like they're the only team I'll ever play for. I would love it if that is the case.

'I’ve always said from when I made my debut against Wolves in 2007 that the fans have been nothing but brilliant with me, so I’d just like to say a big thank you to them. 

'They’ve supported me throughout my whole career with Leicester so far and I hope that they continue to do so.'
