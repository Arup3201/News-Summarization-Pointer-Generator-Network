Jeb Bush has surged into the lead in the Republican presidential candidate race according to the latest poll.

The surge in popularity follows his announcement last week to 'actively explore' a bid to run in the 2016 race. 

According to the survey by CNN in conjunction with OCR, he is the choice of nearly a quarter (24 per cent) of GOP supporters interviewed and ten points ahead of his closest rival, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (13 per cent).

Jeb Bush has the largest lead in the polls by a Republican presidential hopeful in two years. The former Governor of Florida is 10 points ahead of closest rival, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie 

Physician Ben Carson came in third with 7 per cent of the support, while Senator Rand Paul and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee were tied for fourth with 6 per cent. 

It is the first time that a GOP potential has led beyond a poll's margin of error in the past two years. 

However, of the Republicans polled, some said they were less likely to vote for him on some of the issues he has encountered as the Governor of Florida. 

For example 42 per cent say his description of illegal immigration as an 'act of love' make them less likely to support Bush, but another 39 per cent say it makes no difference to them. 

In the Democratic race, Hilary Clinton is still the runaway favorite, with two-thirds of support within her party.

Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is the closest to her, but with a distant 9 per cent. 

Bush last week said that he is going to 'active explore' a bid to run for the White House. He has constantly been ahead of his competitors in 2016 polls 

Last week Bush showed more signs he was preparing for a run at the White House.

He stopped booking paid speeches, though he will follow through on previous commitments through early next year.

After his father's loss Bush decided to stay in politics, first as a campaign manager for Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and later as a candidate himself. He failed at his first attempt to be elected to public office but succeeded at winning the governor's mansion on his second try in 1998.

Two consecutive terms as governor later, Bush reentered the private sector in 2007 and joined the boards of Lehman Brothers, which was later absorbed in part by Barclays after the 2008 financial crisis, Swisher Hygiene, InnoVida, Rayonier and Tenet.
