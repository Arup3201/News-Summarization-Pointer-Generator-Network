In dusty aviation graveyards around the world, abandoned planes are being stripped for parts by a pair of brothers who turn them into bespoke, high-end furniture.  

Brett and Shane Armstrong from Kent travel the globe collecting scrap from the aviation industry and transform the junk into desks, coffee tables, sofas and clocks.

Among their designs is a £7,000 chair made from a Martin Baker MK10 ejector seat, as well as a £25,000 sofa made from the fuel tank of a Corsair jet.

Hangar 54 is not the first company to create bespoke furniture from aviation parts.

Californian company Motoart spends hours transforming wings, doors and engine cowls into stylish furniture.

Many of the parts require more than 100 hours of cutting, grounding, buffing and polishing before they are ready to buy.

The company's bomber seats even come with the original ejector pin and 'remove before flight' warning tag.

Its prices range from from £65 for a desk watch to £39,000 for a one-of-a-kind conference table, made from a wing.

The sofa, built into the rear of the droptank, is made of red leather and can seat up to three people.

There is also a circular office desk made from a Boeing 737 engine cowling, with a 15ft diameter.

It can be bought on its own or with a matching recycled elevator from a Douglas DC-3 airliner.

The DC-3 was introduced in 1936. It was active until 1942, and again in 1950, before being retired.

Only 607 of the fixed-wing propeller planes were ever made.

The vintage Martin Baker ejector seats were taken from RAF Tornados. They now pass as luxury chairs and bar stools worth £7,000.

Others designs created by the Armstrongs' firm Hangar 54 include chairs made from Martin Baker MK10 ejector seats, like the one pictured. The British rocket-powered seat was built by Martin Baker in the 1970s. By 1989, the seat was fitted into 28 different types of aircraft

Another design is the time-zone wall clock made from a piece of Boeing 747 fuselage, pictured, and its windows. The clock costs £1,200 per window and any time zone can be added

The Martin-Baker MK 10 was a British rocket-powered ejection seat built by Martin Baker in the 1970s. By 1989, the seat was fitted into 28 different types of aircraft.

Another design is the time-zone wall clock made from a piece of Boeing 747 fuselage and its windows. The clock costs £1,200 per window and any time zone can be added.

Brett, 38, and Shane, 47, are now preparing to showcase their high-end furniture at the Paris Air Show this summer.

This reception desk has been made from the engine intake of a Boeing 737. It costs £20,000. The firm has also created other circular office desks from the engine's cowling which are 15ft in diameter

Hangar 54 charges £1,250 from this coffee table made from the tail of a bomb

Inspired after seeing an old engine cowling being used as a table, Brett, from Tunbridge Wells, said: 'We realised we could a better job and we sat down and realised there was a great business opportunity to create unique pieces of furniture finished to a high standard.

‘We also liked the idea that some of these wonderful pieces from the aviation world weren’t going to be lost or wasted forever.

‘These items are really pieces of scrap that are scrap value that have been brought back to life and turned into a thing of beauty a that also has a practical purpose.

‘Some items, like the ejector seats, were quite easy to look at and think of as a piece of furniture.

'Other pieces, like the belly tank sofa, took a bit more imagination.

‘But a lot of these parts are extremely hard to find, such as the Martin Baker ejector seats.

'We have got three of them at the moment. While the wall clock comes from the fuselage of 737-400s which are readily available.'
