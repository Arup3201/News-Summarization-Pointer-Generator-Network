The number of prisoners caught with active Facebook accounts has almost double in the last year, new figures have revealed.

A leading charity has warned offenders accessing social media can be 'hugely distressing' for their victims after it was revealed the number of active Facebook accounts detected had increased by almost 50 per cent.

Victim Support has said some criminals have even used the internet to 'taunt victims and attempt to intimidate witnesses'.

Prisoners are banned from updating their Facebook accounts while serving their sentence or asking others to do so from outside prison.

The Ministry of Justice has warned any inmates who are caught breaking the rules will be 'stripped of privileges' and the matter 'referred to the police'.

Figures released following a Freedom of Information request revealed the number of detected active accounts which had been deleted had jumped from 49 in 2012 to 93
 up to by the end of this November.

While numbers had risen over the last year, the figure has in fact dropped dramatically from 2010 and 2011, when 203 and 204 active accounts were deleted.

It means a total of 549 prisoners' Facebook accounts have been detected as being active and deleted since 2010.

According to figures released following a Freedom of Information request, 18 Facebook accounts were deleted at HMP Parc, in Wales, in 2011, while in 2012 the highest number of accounts detected was at HMP Wolds, in East Yorkshire.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling reacted with fury after the pictures showing the pair surrounded by gadgets were published in the Mail

So far this year the highest number of accounts have been found at HMP Wealstun, in West Yorkshire, where 12 have been detected and deleted.

The National Offender Management Service has said it is not always known whether the prisoner is updating the account or whether a third party on the outside is doing it on their behalf.

Javed
 Khan, chief executive of charity Victim Support, said: 'If offenders 
are able to access Facebook from prison it makes a mockery of the idea 
that they are being punished and can be hugely distressing for the 
victims of their crimes.

'We
 know some criminals have used social media to taunt their victims and 
attempt to intimidate witnesses, and it is essential that this kind of 
activity is prevented.'

A 
Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'The Justice Secretary has made 
clear that it is totally unacceptable for prisoners to access social 
networking sites.

'Those
 who break the rules will be dealt with severely, and no prisoner should
 be in any doubt that if they are found with a mobile phone or any other
 illicit items they will be stripped of their privileges and reported to
 the police for further action.'

In August, the Daily Mail reported how two violent thugs were caught boasting of their easy prison life on Facebook.

Sonny Barker and Korrel Kennedy posted pictures they had taken in their cell at HMP Rochester in Kent on to Facebook.

Justice
 Secretary Chris Grayling reacted with fury after the pictures showing 
the pair surrounded by gadgets were published in the Mail.

At
 the time it was reported the pair had lost their TV, were being made to
 wear prison uniform and could be moved to a tougher jail after they were caught. Police had 
also been informed.

Mr
 Grayling demanded the prison authoriries 'throw the book' at the pair, 
who faced having up to 42 extra days added to their sentences.

Barker, 20, was jailed for eight years after he held a mother and daughter at knifepoint in their home during a burglary.

Kennedy, 20, a former Jean Paul Gaultier model, was jailed for chasing a man with a knife and threatening hospital staff.

In his first post on Facebook on June 29, Barker wrote: ‘What’s happening! Coming from live from prison. Whos (sic) missing me.’ He added: ‘I’ll be home soon. Real soon December 2015.’

When one friend wrote he had ‘it on smash’ – prison slang for living an easy life inside – he replied: ‘When haven’t I had it on smash? Admit it, been bossing since Elmley [Prison].’

HMP Rochester is a Category C young offender institution for 650 males deemed untrustworthy and likely to try to escape.

The men faced being moved to a Category B jail.

And earlier this month, MailOnline reported how Michael McInnes, 23, who was jailed for attempted murder, taunted police by posting pictures of drunken nights out with friends on his Facebook account after going on the run from prison.

McInnes failed to return from home leave from Castle Huntly prison, near Dundee, almost a fortnight earlier.

But rather than going into hiding, McIness had been boasting about his drunken exploits on the social networking site since absconding.

According to the Daily Record, McInnes even risked a visit to one of his favourite nightclubs in Bellshill, Lanarkshire, three days after he absconded and posted a picture of him with his arm around other revelers online.

Clearly amused by McInnes's posts, one of his Facebook friends commented: 'Your the hide n seek champion lol x' (sic).

Another posted: 'Your daft hahahaha' (sic).

McInnes brazenly shared a link to a newspaper article about him being on the run from prison on his Facebook profile

McInnes, who posted a link to a newspaper story about his escape online, was jailed for six years in 2010 after leaving Kevin McNee brain damaged after repeatedly kicking and stamping on his head in a vicious attack.

He had previous convictions for violent offences.

Mr McNee spent three months in hospital following the attack and a further nine months in a rehabilitation centre for brain injury victims.

Despite being given an extended sentence because he was deemed likely to refoffend, McInnes was allowed to leave jail on home visits within three years.

The mother of McInnes's victim, Agnes McNee told the Daily Record: 'He's a very dangerous man and the judge said he was capable of doing it again.

'He should never have been in an open prison, he should have been kept in a secure jail because he's a danger to the public.

'When we saw on Facebook that he had been celebrating with his friends at a club, it just made us sick.'

The Scottish Prison service has faced criticism from both Scottish Conservatives and Labour over the decision to allow McInnes on home leave.

But a spokesman said that it would be 'inappropriate to comment' while an investigation was ongoing when contacted by MailOnline earlier this month.
