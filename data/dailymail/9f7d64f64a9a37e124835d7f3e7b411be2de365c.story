Scotland Yard detectives swooped on the family home of Field Marshall Lord Bramall of Bushfield, the former chief of the defence staff and a D-Day veteran

At 91, Lord Bramall – the latest VIP to be dragged into the sex abuse inquiry – is the oldest and most respected of Britain's eight living Field Marshals.

He stepped down as Chief of Defence Staff in 1985 after four decades spent climbing the ranks from 2nd Lieutenant right to the pinnacle of Britain's armed forces.

Lord Bramall first saw action on the Normandy beaches the day after D-Day, when he was shelled. 

Everyone else in his vehicle died but he managed to crawl out. At first he thought he was on fire, but in fact he was badly wounded and was sent back to Britain for treatment.

Lord Bramall returned to his unit just five weeks later and was leading a patrol on the Dutch-Belgian border when he was ambushed. 

Rather than flee, he led a counter-attack, and managed to wound two Germans and take another one captive. He was later awarded the Military Cross for his actions by Field Marshal Montgomery himself.

He led the Royal Green Jackets in Borneo in 1965, commanded British forces in Hong Kong in the 1970s and was made head of the Army in 1979. 

Lord Bramall held that role during the Falklands War of 1982, and was a strong admirer of Margaret Thatcher. 'A wonderful war leader,' he said, 'probably even better than Churchill'.

Born in 1923, Lord Bramall's father came from a merchant family in the Potteries in Staffordshire, while his mother hailed from impoverished aristocracy. 

She would forever call him 'my baby' – even when phoning his office while he was head of the Army.

He captained Eton's cricket team, had two pictures displayed at the Royal Academy, and to his mother's chagrin, turned down a place at Oxford to join the Army.

He married his wife Avril in 1949 and they have two children. The couple are still together.

After he retired, festooned with decorations, he became a life peer – and has never been afraid to speak his mind in the Lords – opposing the second war in Iraq and what he termed 'mission creep' in Afghanistan.

More recently, Lord Bramall has also been a vocal critic of defence cuts, which he fears could weaken the Army. 

He told peers that when it comes to dealing with threats you 'have to prepare for the unexpected'.

Eton-educated Lord Bramall commanded a platoon at the D-Day landings and led the Army as chief of the general staff during the Falklands campaign.He was awarded the Military Cross in 1945

 

The headline to an earlier version of this article wrongly stated that Lord Bramall had been arrested. While the article made clear that this had not been the case, we are happy to set the record straight and apologise for any confusion caused.
