A month after a pay dispute controversially derailed its tour to India, the West Indies Cricket Board has confirmed that 14 top-flight players have been contracted for a three-test series in South Africa.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India, the most powerful stakeholder in the game, suspended bilateral ties with the West Indies last month and threatened to claim millions in compensation.

There was initially concern about the South Africa tour going ahead next month, but West Indies management took the first step last week by selecting a 15-man squad and giving players a week to sign and return the tour contracts.

Denesh Ramdin captains the side to play three Tests in South Africa, starting on December 17

The WICB on Tuesday said Darren Bravo was the only player who asked not to be considered for the series, due to personal reasons.

West Indies players, captained by Bravo's half-brother Dwayne Bravo, quit a tour of India in October due to a contract dispute with the WICB. 

Denesh Ramdin will remain captain for the South Africa series while opening batsman Chris Gayle provides a major boost to the line-up as he returns from injury.  

The Windies play their first of three southern hemisphere summer Tests starts on December 17 at Centurion, with three Twenty20 internationals and five one-day internationals to follow.
