A scientist tagging newborn seal pups in Erebus Bay, Antarctica, has shared an adorable photo he took of a baby seal nuzzling up to its mom.

William Link of the U.S. Geological Survey captured the heartwarming moment involving the Weddell seal and her pup back in October.

Link, a statistician, was helping researchers tag newborn seal pups when he saw the baby seal cuddle up and plant a kiss on the side of the mom's face.

'I carried my camera a good bit and took about 4,000 photos while I was there,' Link told ABC News. 'The seals would just be hanging out on the ice. They're not afraid of people. You can walk right up to them.'

Since it was posted on Instagram last week by both the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of Interior it has received over 19,000 likes.

The public affairs department for the U.S.G.S. had asked scientists for interesting images to post on social media which inspired Link to submit this particular image.

After a seal pup is born, the mom spends all her time close to her baby and hardly interacts with other seals.

The Weddell seal population of Erebus Bay, Antarctica has been extensively studied for over 40 years; one of the longest running studies of a long-lived mammal.

Because of the isolation, the animal are relatively undisturbed by human activities. The Weddell seal population is healthy and stable, and thus gives a good example for studies of animal population dynamics.
