A judge was applauded from the public gallery of his court for jailing two thugs who battered an old soldier on Remembrance Day.

The yobs attacked 78-year-old Cyril Edmonds as he made his way home from the pub where he had been raising a glass to fallen comrades.

Gary Mills, 22, and Matthew Putson, 17, hit him in the face with his own walking stick, threatened him with a knife and stole his money and phone. Police later found a combined knuckleduster and lock-knife on Putson, who had taken a cocktail of cannabis and prescription drugs.

There was spontaneous applause from the public gallery and shouts of ‘well done’ when Judge Michael Taylor jailed Mills for seven years and nine months, and Putson for four years at Teesside Crown Court on Tuesday.

Mr Edmonds was knocked over when the thugs took his stick from him in the attack in Middlesbrough last year, and had to crawl to a nearby house for help. He suffered injuries to his cheek, hand and arm and his sight has since deteriorated so much that he is almost blind in his right eye.

The yobs, both from Middlesbrough, admitted robbery, having an offensive weapon and a separate offence of burglary with intent to steal. Judge Taylor told them: ‘It would have been obvious to anybody that saw him he was vulnerable and elderly.

‘In a cowardly way the two of you attacked him. His stick was taken from him, he fell to the ground and you then rifled through his clothing.

‘You relieved him of his mobile phone and one of you used his walking stick against him, smashing it against his face.’

The judge also lifted a court restriction which had banned the media from naming Putson because of his age, saying: ‘The public are entitled to know what is going on.’

Great-grandfather Mr Edmonds, who has also worked as a bricklayer, said he was pleased with the sentences.

‘I’m quite happy with it. I consider they got what they deserved,’ he told the Middlesbrough Gazette.

‘They hit me in the face with my stick and they took my phone. They are just scum really. They are not going to beat me.’

But he said he will now only go to the pub when he is escorted by his son-in-law.

Duncan McReddie, defending Putson, said: ‘With the benefit of a clear head he fully understands the terrible nature of this crime.’

Defending Mills, who already has two convictions for robbery, Robert Mochrie said he should be given credit for his guilty pleas.

After the hearing DC Marie Appleby of Cleveland Police issued a statement saying she was ‘delighted’ with the sentences and hoped the pair ‘will now realise the severity of their actions’.

She added: ‘This was a cowardly and disgraceful attack on a defenceless elderly man, who was even unable to retreat to the safety of his own home after Putson and Mills threw his walking aid out of reach.’

The sentences contrast with that of Lewis Gill who was given just four-and-a-half years in jail for killing Asperger’s sufferer Andrew Young, 40, with a punch when he asked Gill’s friend not to cycle on the pavement in Bournemouth last year.
