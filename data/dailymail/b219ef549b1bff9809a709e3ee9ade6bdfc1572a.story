Michelle Obama has touched down in Tokyo in what is being described as a 'makeup call' after she 'snubbed' the Japanese by failing to accompany her husband during his state visit to Japan last year.

In a further patching up of relations, Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzō Abe, is due to make a reciprocal visit to America next month.

Mrs Obama's previous no-show  upset members of the Japanese establishment so deeply that one politician, Kazuyuki Hamada, made the outrageous claim that the Obamas were getting divorced, as the president had been using Secret Service agents to cover for his extramarital affairs.

Mrs Obama's trip comes at a time of high tension for Americans in Japan, as Tokyo police investigate phone calls threatening to kill U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy and Alfred Magleby, the U.S. consul general based on the southern island of Okinawa.

Her arrival also coincides with a visit by former president Bill Clinton, who is in the country to deliver a keynote speech at the JFK International Symposium held at Waseda University in Tokyo.

During the five-day trip, Mrs Obama will also visit Cambodia - whose leader, Hun Sen, has a reputation for ruthlessness, and where child prostitution and human trafficking is rife - to highlight a campaign supporting education for girls. 

There were so far no details on the cost of the trip but the First Lady's group spent $222,000 over two days in hotel expenses during her 2014 trip to China, the Washington Examiner reported. 

Mrs Obama, who is visiting Japan for the first time, will have separate meetings with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko. She will visit historic sites in the ancient capital, Kyoto, before travelling to Cambodia.

In Tokyo she plans to announce, along with Japanese first lady Akie Abe, the Let Girls Learn initiative, a partnership supporting girls' education. The two will also meet with Japanese university students.

It is hoped that the community-based aid program, led by the Peace Corps and similar aid organizations, will help get 62 million girls back into school.

White House staff said that the program also reflects a U.S. commitment to be more involved in the Asia-Pacific region.

Mrs Obama will be the first sitting U.S. first lady to visit Cambodia, one of 11 countries participating in the Let Girls Learn initiative.

Cambodia's government is led by Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has a reputation for ruthlessness and little tolerance for dissent. The country also has child prostitution and human trafficking problems.

Evan Medeiros, senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, told reporters that while in Cambodia, Mrs Obama plans to discuss the need for open and inclusive politics and highlight basic values and principles that are important to the U.S.

In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal earlier this week, Mrs. Obama called it a 'tragic waste of human potential' when 62 million girls worldwide are not in school.

'It is also a serious public-health challenge, a drag on national economies and global prosperity, and a threat to the security of countries around the world, including our own,' Mrs. Obama wrote in her online travel journal.

'This visit is part of a journey that began decades ago, back when I was a little girl.' 

YouTube celebrity Michelle Phan is joining Mrs. Obama in Tokyo to help spread awareness for the Let Girls Learn campaign, and pose questions to the first lady submitted through Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
