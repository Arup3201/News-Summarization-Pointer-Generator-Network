Business Secretary Vince Cable has accused teachers of failing to provide good careers advice for their pupils

Teachers are failing students because they ‘know absolutely nothing about the world of work’, Business Secretary Vince Cable has said.

The Liberal Democrat minister was accused of being ‘crass’ and ‘insulting’ to teachers after suggesting they are to blame for a lack of good careers advice in schools.

His remarks were seized on by political opponents, and risk undoing months of attempts by the Lib Dems to win back some of their traditional support in the teaching profession by attacking Education Secretary Michael Gove.

The Business Secretary was speaking to hundreds of senior figures in the manufacturing industry, and claimed Government schemes to get students interested in careers in their sector were being thwarted by an ‘underlying problem’ - teachers themselves.

‘There has been an argument in Government about how to get the right careers advice in schools and successive governments have frankly messed this up,’ Mr Cable said.

‘But the underlying problem is of course that most teachers, particularly in the secondary sector, are graduates.

‘They know how universities work, they know what you have to do to get an A-level, they know about UCAS forms – but they know absolutely nothing about the world of work.

‘They don't know how to direct people to apprenticeships or traineeships which we're now doing as a first stage for people.

‘We're issuing guidance to schools on how they should put in place proper careers guidance in schools linked to the world of work, but we start from a bad place.’

A senior source at the Department for Education said: ‘These comments are offensive to teachers who work hard every day. Cable should pay a visit to some inner city schools before saying teachers know nothing about the world of work. Instead of lashing out at teachers, Cable should be getting business to engage with schools.’

Mr Cable claimed Government schemes to interest students in careers in their industry were thwarted by teachers

Cathy Bell, head of Esher Church School in Surrey, said Mr Cable’s remarks were ‘absurd’, pointing out that many teachers converted from other careers.

‘Before I went into teaching in 2000, I was responsible for managing a marketing and advertising budget for a cosmetics company which was larger than our entire school budget is now,’ she said.

‘There would be very few industries in which staff would have sufficient experience in all other business sectors to be able to give career advice. 

‘Many teachers do convert to teaching from other careers, usually because they feel strongly about the vocational aspect of teaching, but there is nothing wrong with being a career teacher.

Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, labelled Mr Cable's comments 'crass'

‘We don't pretend to have an in depth knowledge of the manufacturing industry but even as a primary school, we have already this year taken our ten- and 11-year-old children on visits to manufacturing factories and had people talk to them who do. 

‘When I was at school there was a careers advice centre which was separate to the school which sent people in to do practice interviews and offer careers advice.  I'm not sure at what point careers advice became the job of schools alone.’

Teachers’ representatives accused Mr Cable of seeking to curry favour from a business audience, saying he was ‘finding scapegoats and playing to the gallery’.

Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers (NUT), said: ‘This is a crass remark, which is insulting to teachers who are workers in their own right.

‘As the Government’s own survey shows, teachers work an extraordinary number of hours and show real dedication to the world of work. Indeed, the teaching profession mirrors society and many of our teachers come from diverse backgrounds with different life experiences. They are a resource to the young people they teach, not a hindrance.’

A spokeswoman for the Department for Business was unapologetic. ‘The Business Secretary was echoing concerns from industry about the need to improve the quality of careers advice in schools,’ she said.

‘He was making the point that teachers have an important role in making sure their pupils are aware of all options available to them to help them build a career.

'For some this may be via a graduate route, but for others a vocational skill or qualification is more appropriate.’
