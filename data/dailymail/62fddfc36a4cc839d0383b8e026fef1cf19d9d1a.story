Humans can work out a dog's mood just by the sound of its bark, according to new research

Humans can work out a dog's mood just by the sound of its bark, according to new research.

People use the same rules to work out how their dog is feeling, as they do to determine the emotional state of friends.

The study found that owners listen to the length and pitch of the barks their dogs make to understand their canine companion.

Researchers from Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, said that shorter barks sounded more positive and higher pitched noises more intense.

Dr Tamas Farago, part of MTA-ELTE Comparative Ethology Research Group based at the university, said: ‘Humans are extremely good at recognising other's emotions based on their behaviour or even voice.

‘We were curious when they hear a human laugh, cry or the calls of our close companion the dog, whether they use the same acoustical rules to assess the caller's inner state.

‘We found the most important features of both dog and human sounds were the length of the sound and its pitch.’

The findings confirm what many dog owners have long claimed, that they can tell if their pet is happy, sad, angry or afraid, based purely on its different barks.

Scientists used to believe that barking is a random noise without any specific information or content.

But evidence at Dr Farago's Family Dog Project Lab - one of the world's first facilities dedicated to the human-dog relationships – has revealed that there is more to it.

A study found that owners listen to the length and pitch of the barks their dogs make to understand their canine companion. Shorter barks were found to sound more positive and higher pitched noises more intense

In the study, 39 volunteers listened to 200 recordings of dogs and humans (where the humans made noises but did not speak) and were then asked to score them on a scale measuring emotions.

Dr Farago said that in both dog and human samples the shorter the calls the more positively they were rated.

Higher pitched samples were also marked as ‘more intense in both species' vocalisations.’

The research, published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, is the first to directly compare how people perceive human and dog sounds.

Previous studies found that humans can assess the emotions of dogs based on their barks, but the new research involved a much wider range of noises.

‘We used several different dog calls like growls, whines, moans and similarly the human sounds we played back were pretty diverse,’ Dr Farago told MailOnline.

The research enabled him to directly compare what parameters can affect the assessment of emotions in dogs and humans.

Dr Farago said: ‘We show humans use similar acoustical parameters to attribute emotional valence and intensity to both human and dog vocalisations.’

Together with earlier studies, the 
research suggests the general rules discovered could be applied to other
 mammal noises and bird sounds, although this has yet to be proven.

He believes the findings may even be used in the future for improving interactions between people and artificial intelligence.

‘Using these rules we can develop artificial emotion expressions that can be easily recognised and can be used in social robots or other devices,’ he added.

This week scientists revealed that the 'puppy dog eyes' expression that dogs make taps into our subconscious.

Research by the University of Portsmouth found dogs that raise their inner brows, to make their eyes appear larger, are chosen by prospective owners more quickly than other dogs.

The study suggests that dogs have evolved in response to the human preference towards childlike faces.

In conjunction with the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition, researchers used a newly developed tool called DogFACS to analyse dogs’ facial expressions.

They studied every muscle movement made by 27 dogs in re-homing shelters when a person came and stood in front of their pen.

The tool counted the number of times the dogs raised their inner brows and widened their eyes as a prospective owner approached.

Dogs that produced more of these movements attracted an owner quicker with their ‘child-like’ expression than those that did not.

Lead author, Dr Bridget Waller, an expert in the evolution of social communication at the university, believes the results of the study suggest that wolves which produced childlike expressions may have been more tolerated by humans, and so modern dogs have inherited these features.
