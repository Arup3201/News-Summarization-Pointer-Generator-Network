A jeering mob encouraged a suicidal man to ‘get on with it and jump’ before he plunged to his death from a car park.

Some in the crowd of around 30 even took ‘selfies’ and filmed the drama on their phones as the man stood on a ledge 60ft above ground.

Their actions were last night condemned by police. Officers said that those who took the offensive photographs and posted footage of his death on social media could face prosecution.

A jeering mob encouraged a suicidal man to ‘get on with it and jump’ before he plunged to his death from a car park in Telford, Shropshire (above)

The victim, who was in his 40s, had spent two hours on the top of the car park in the town of Telford, Shropshire, before he fell on Saturday afternoon. He has not yet been formally identified.

Witnesses told how cries including ‘How far can you bounce?’ and ‘Go on jump’ could be heard as he stood on the ledge at the Southwater One car park.

A man of 57 who was in a building opposite said: ‘I saw a crowd of people of all ages, some with small children, gathered outside watching this poor man. Many were taking pictures.’

The onlooker, who did not want to be named, said the man had waited on the ledge for more than two hours while a crowd of around 30 gathered below. He said that, although police had cordoned off the scene, some of the mob ducked under the tape to see more.

‘I just felt for the guy,’ the witness said. ‘I can’t imagine what frame of mind he could be in to want to do this. As for those who did take pictures and posted them – they should be ashamed.’

Another witness, Kelly-Anne Taylor, 35, said: ‘People were recording it with their phones and yelling at him to jump.

‘I can’t stop thinking about it. I could have tried to help him. I am so heartbroken for him and his family. Onlookers were yelling at him to jump.’ 

Others took to social media to tell of their disgust. One woman wrote: ‘The fact people were shouting for the man to jump from that building in Southwater and filming it make me worry for our generation. Scum.’

West Mercia Police has hit out at the 'appalling' actions of the crowd who gathered outside Southwater Shopping Centre in Telford (pictured), and said anyone who chanted should be 'unequivocally condemned'

Another Twitter user, Georgia Wade, wrote: ‘RIP to that poor man who jumped off the Southwater multi-storey today hope those people feel ashamed of themselves telling him to jump.’

A petition has been launched on campaigning website Change.org calling for those who ‘encouraged’ the victim to be arrested. In just five hours it gathered more than 1,000 signatures.

Friends of the man took to the website to voice their disgust. Jacqueline Hickman wrote: ‘This man was a friend, a lovely warm, caring man. The people who goaded him are despicable. They all deserve to be arrested.’

Rebecca Hadley said: ‘I am appalled with the behaviour of the Telford people and worked closely with the poor man who took his life.’ 

Officers were called to the shopping centre at around 1pm. The man fell to his death at 3.40pm. Detective Sergeant Mark O’Connor of West Mercia Police said: ‘We hope the local community would work with our officers to provide information regarding those who committed the cruel taunts. This was clearly someone who was in need of support.’

He added: ‘The origin of any comments or material that is deemed to be unlawful will be investigated and appropriate police action will be taken.’
