Phil Jones was refusing to curb his whole-hearted approach ahead of England’s game against Honduras – just ask Jack Wilshere.

The Arsenal man was left in a heap following a meaty barge from his Manchester United adversary during the warm-up.

Wilshere had just released a pass during a session of keep-ball when Jones clumsily sent his team-mate tumbling to the turf.

But the 22-year-old suffered no ill-effects and was okay to take his place among the substitutes.

Jones, too, was on the bench for England’s final friendly match before their World Cup opener against Italy next Saturday.
