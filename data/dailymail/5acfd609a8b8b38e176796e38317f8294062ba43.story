Leading figures in the LA porn industry say they'll start packing up their sex toys and abandoning the U.S. porn capital if authorities carry through with an effort to police film sets and order that every actor wear a condom.

That move took step closer to becoming reality on Tuesday when the Los Angeles city council voted 9-1 to grant final approval to an ordinance that would deny film permits to producers who do not comply with the condom requirement.

The measure now goes to Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa for approval.

Before the measure can take effect, 
the council has called for the creation of a committee to determine how 
it might be enforced.

'It's
going to be interesting to see how in fact they do try to enforce it 
and who's going to fund it, and all of the time and effort they're going
to spend,' said Steven Hirsch, co-founder and co-chairman of Los 
Angeles-based Vivid, one of the largest makers of erotic movies.

'Ultimately I think what they will 
find is people will just stop shooting in the city of Los Angeles,' 
added Hirsch. 'That's a given.'

His company would be among those that would consider leaving, he said.

Approximately
90 per cent of U.S. porn films are made in Los Angeles, almost all of 
them in the city's San Fernando Valley, said Mark Kernes, senior editor 
of Adult Video News.

When films, Internet downloads, sex 
toys and admission to dance clubs are counted, Kernes said, it's an 
industry that produces about $8 billion a year in revenue.

It has been battered in recent years, however, by the recession and the increased popularity of free Internet porn.

Kernes and others say requiring condoms would further erode business.

They
say consumers, particularly those overseas, have made it clear they 
won't watch films when the actors use condoms, complaining that it is 
distracting and ruins the fantasy.

'The
only thing that the city could potentially achieve is losing some film 
permit money and driving some productions away, but you can't actually 
compel an industry to create a product that the market doesn't want,' 
said Christian Mann, general manager of Evil Angel, another of the 
industry's largest production companies.

Ged
Kenslea, spokesman for the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, said the measure
is needed because the industry has failed to properly police itself.

For years, he said, filmmakers have 
ignored state health laws mandating the use of condoms when workers are 
exposed to blood-borne pathogens.

'Let's
make one thing clear: Condom use on adult film sets is, and has been, 
the law in California under blood-borne pathogens regulations,' he said.
'It is just a law that has not been uniformly enforced or followed.

'This
film permit ordinance that the city council approved today provides 
another enforcement mechanism to make sure that adult film producers are
complying with existing California law.'

The council's final vote to approve the law was taken without public discussion, on a day when most of the porn industry's major players were in Las Vegas preparing for Wednesday's opening of the Adult Entertainment Expo, their industry's largest trade event.

The industry already does its own policing, filmmakers say, requiring actors be tested for sexually transmitted diseases a minimum of every 30 days when they are working.

They say no cases of HIV have been directly linked to porn films since 2004, adding they fear if the industry scatters to areas outside of Los Angeles, testing could fall by the wayside, exposing performers to more risk.

'If someone is going to catch an STD, it's usually out of the business because we are tested so often,' said veteran porn actress and producer Tabitha Stevens.

In her 17 years in the business, Stevens said, she has worked both with and without condoms.

Although she prefers to use condoms, acknowledging they do increase safety, she said the choice should be left up to the performers and not mandated by a government agency.

'If you want to wear them, wear them. If you don't, don't. That's up to the talent to decide. It shouldn't be up to the government to decide,' she said.
