Mr Rowe has been advocating for the AFL to be broadcast in HD for two years

An avid AFL fan has accused the Seven Network of 'backflipping' on a promise to broadcast the 2014 grand final on it's high definition channel.

Josh Rowe, a passionate AFL follower, has been advocating for the broadcast of AFL in HD for over two years, with his webite 'AFL in HD Please' having nearly 80,000 followers on Twitter.

Rowe went public with emails on Tuesday which detail communication between himself and Seven Melbourne managing director Lewis Martin, which indicate that the network made a commitment to show the AFL grand final on their HD broadcast channel, 7Mate.

'I thought we had achieved something,' said Rowe.

'He didn't have to make that promise, but he did and he broke it. He wanted the whole campaign to be shut down by making a promise, and now he has to feel the consequences of doing that.'

In March this year, Rowe had a phone conference with Seven Melbourne's  Lewis Martin regarding the commercial realities of broadcasting in HD, during which Martin made a verbal commitment to broadcast the grand final in HD.

'We had a very open conversation,' Rowe told Daily Mail Australia, 'during which he told me that the grand final would be in HD. I was delighted.'

Mr Lewis insisted he never made such a promise

Free-to-air channels have been beset by requests from sports fans to broadcast games in HD, an ongoing issue for many enthusiasts in Australia. 

Many major sporting codes are not broadcast in the higher definition resolution, with the Seven, Nine and Ten networks only broadcasting in standard definition.

'I followed up the meeting with an email, asking for permission to announce the good news. Lewis replied back and asked if I would keep it confidential,' said Rowe, 'and I agreed.'

In the email dated March 31st from Martin to Rowe, the managing director of Seven Melbourne asks, 're GF (grand final) this year that needs to remain confidential'.

'We have been emailing back and forth frequently since March and at no point did he say that the grand final would be in standard definition. I emailed him a few weeks ago and he told me to hold the fort, and it wasn't until I saw the TV guide published that I realised the Seven Network hadn't scheduled the grand final in HD.'

After learning that the Seven Network did not intend to broadcast the grand final this Saturday between the Hawthorn Hawks and Sydney Swans in HD, Rowe confronted Martin. 

'I called him and asked if it was a mistake. He said it wasn't, and then denied ever making the promise to me,' said Rowe.

'I did not promise that. I said to you I would update you in the event we would be. I shared with you the commercial realities,' wrote Martin in an email provided to Daily Mail Australia, which Rowe has labelled as a 'gold medal winning back flip'.

'I said that I was going to publish the emails on my blog,' said Rowe.

''I kept my promise for this whole year, and if anything, dampened slightly the efforts of the HD campaign because of what I knew.' 

The 80,000-strong social media following had gathered strength earlier in the year, in addition to a petition for the grand final to be broadcast in HD

The some 80,000-strong social media following had gathered strength earlier in the year, in addition to a petition for the grand final to be broadcast in HD. 

'The campaign was pushing for change,' said Rowe, 'Not just for myself but for all the fans out there. To have that all fall away is so disappointing, and I think people need to know what Channel 7 is doing.'

'They have chosen to air B-grade shows which garner only a small viewer base simply for the profit margin. Instead of broadcasting the grand final which is one of the biggest sporting events of the year, they have let down fans and chosen money.'

Airing on 7Mate at the time of the grand final on Saturday are episodes of Swamp Men, motoring programs, Pimp My Ride and a collectible show called Bid America. 

Rowe is now campaigning for awareness, calling for a boycott of sponsors of the AFL and deliberately spreading information about HD options.

The Seven Network has declined to comment, issuing a statement that the grand final is available in standard definition, returning to the base line which Rowe is so passionate about improving.
