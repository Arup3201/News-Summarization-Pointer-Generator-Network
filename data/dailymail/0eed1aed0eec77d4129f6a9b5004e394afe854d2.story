Disney smash Frozen has inspired a host of tributes and parodies in recent months but now someone has taken it to a very different – and kinky - place.

Fifty Shades Of Frozen takes the dialogue from the trailer to the forthcoming S&M romance Fifty Shades Of Grey but replaces scenes from the Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson-staring movie with clips of the most popular animated film of all time.

Once you watch the end result you’ll never be able to look at Frozen in the same light again as it adds an altogether steamier undercurrent to Hans and Anna’s romance which was wholly missing from the G-rated cartoon princess musical.

Watch: Fifty Shades Of Frozen

The forthcoming S&M romance Fifty Shades Of Grey features Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson taking on the roles of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele

As a stand-in for Christian Grey, Prince Hans is eerily appropriate as the mash-up shows the manipulative prince to have much in common with control-freak corporate titan

The mash-up is the handiwork of YouTube user Tranceart Violeta, who has skilfully pieced the two movies together.

As a stand-in for Christian Grey, Prince Hans is eerily appropriate. He may not have a Red Room of Pain hidden in his castle, but the mash-up shows the manipulative prince to have much in common with control-freak corporate titan Grey.

Other Frozen parodies in recent months have included the Oscar-winning song Let It Go rewritten as Do You Want To Be My Boyfriend, Do You Wanna Get A Beer, Man and by father sick of the musical who sings 'Let it go, let it go, I'm gonna smash the radio'.

Not out until next February, Fifty Shades Of Grey is the hotly-anticipated movie adaptation of E.L. James' best-selling novel.

Pure passion! Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson put on a steamy portrayal as Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele in the 50 Shades Of Grey official trailer, which dropped last month

Fans were given a taste of what’s to come when the extremely steamy trailer was released last month, with Dornan and Johnson taking on the roles of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele.

The clip begins with Anastasia and 
Christian’s first encounter when a shy Ana goes to interview the successful 
businessman at his opulent offices - and the sexual tension is palpable right from the get go.

A timid Ana is instantly enamoured with the ‘polite, intense, smart, intimidating’ Christian, who appears equally intrigued by the doe-eyed brunette. Christian asks: ‘I’d like to know more about you.’

‘There’s really not much to know about me. Look at me,’ the nervous literature student responds as the camera pans out, capturing his high rise office in all its glory.

‘To what do you owe your success,’ Ana questions. ‘I exercise control at all things, Miss Steele,’ Christian tells.

Soon the tranquil mood vanishes and the pair’s intense, adventurous romance begins.

‘I’m incapable of leaving you alone. I don’t do romance. My tastes are very singular. You wouldn’t understand,’ a controlling Christian warns.

But eager-to-please Ana doesn’t think twice. ‘Enlighten me then,’ she says.

Raunchy: The trailer features glimpses of kinky love scenes between the couple

Frozen is the most popular animated film of all time and its Oscar-winning song Let It Go has inspired countless parodies including Do You Wanna Get A Beer, Man and a father sick of the musical who sings 'Let it go, let it go, I'm gonna smash the radio'

Not long now! 50 Shades Of Grey will be released on Valentine's Day next year

A long process: After several setbacks, including actor Charlie Hunnam quitting the role of Christian Grey at the last minute, the crew finally began filming in December last year

As the haunting slowed-down remix of Beyoncé’s Crazy In Love lingers in the background, viewers are shown a kinky montage of the couple’s journey.

The film, which is directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, will be released on Valentine’s Day next year and boasts a star studded cast with the likes of Luke Grimes Elliot, Victor Rasuk and Rita Ora.

After several setbacks, including actor Charlie Hunnam quitting the role of Christian Grey at the last minute, the crew finally began filming in December last year in Vancouver. 

Last year Jamie, 32, opened up to Entertainment Weekly about taking on the role following Charlie's shock departure.

Their biggest movie yet! Dakota had small parts in The Social Network and 21 Jump Street while Jamie has appeared in Marie Antoinette and Beyond The Rave

Good bedfellows: 'That's a big part of it ... having trust,' Doran explained of their job

'You know, one door closes, another opens. When [Charlie] dropped out, I didn't instantly think, "Oh here we go, maybe I should cancel that holiday," but I did feel that maybe we'd revisit the idea of me' the Irish-born actor explained.

As for doing Christian justice the father of one, who welcomed his first daughter with wife Amelia Warner in November last year, told: 'I've never felt that Christian needs to be some kind of monster, but I think it's very clear how he conditions himself and looks after himself.'

'I take decent enough care of myself anyway, so obviously I'm gonna up it slightly with training, but we don't have any intention to really bulk up. I don't think it's appropriate.'

Daring: In one scene, Christian slides his hands up Ana's skirt as they sit at the dinner table with family

Experimenting: Ana and Christian don't hold back when it comes to exploring in the bedroom

Tumultuous: Ana soon realises Christian is controlling

Meanwhile, landing the coveted role of Anastasia Steele was a huge coup for 24-year-old Dakota, whose parents are Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, and it's expected this role will sky-rocket her career.

Despite the raunchy nature of the film, the actress was comfortable filming the sex scenes. 'I don't have any problem doing anything. The secret is I have no shame,' she said to Elle magazine last year.

'Reading the book, I found myself more interested in the ways they were breaking each other down emotionally than the sex scenes. I think there's a part of a woman that wants to be the thing that breaks a man down,' Dakota added.

Not so hot! 'It's not, like, a romantic situation. It's more, like, technical and choreographed and less. It's more of a task,' Dakota said of filming the sex scenes

Mum and dad are banned! Understandably Dakota won't be letting her famous parents watch the film
