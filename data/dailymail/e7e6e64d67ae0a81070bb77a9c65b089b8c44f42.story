Despite being in her seventies, Delia Smith could hardly be said to have gone off the boil.

She
remains the UK’s top cookery author – having sold more than 21million 
books – and the so-called ‘Delia effect’ is famed for having a huge 
impact on the sale of products used in her recipes, from sea salt to 
cranberries.

However, the 
grand dame of TV cooking has been dropped as a face of Waitrose while 
the younger, trendier Heston Blumenthal is being retained.

Odd pairing: Delia Smith and Heston Blumenthal were signed up to be the faces of Waitrose in 2010

The
supermarket claims 71-year-old Miss Smith’s contract was terminated by 
‘mutual agreement’ because she has several other major projects coming 
up this year.

Mr 
Blumenthal’s contract has been renewed and, as well as him featuring in 
new advertising, a Waitrose spokesman said his ‘successful range will 
continue to excite our customers and push the boundaries of supermarket 
innovation’.

Veteran cook 
Miss Smith broke her life-time policy of refusing to advertise 
commercial brands when she signed a money-spinning tie-up with the firm 
three years ago. 

There was
speculation then that her timing may have had something to do with a 
leaked report from executives inside the BBC that claimed she had 
‘limited appeal’ and was in the bottom tier of the corporation’s roster 
of presenting talent.

Delia sticks to what she does best with a classic recipe enjoyed by thousands of people over the years.

The combination of fruit soaked in brandy and mixed spice with nutmeg create a traditional festive flavour.

Waitrose sells a £10 box with all the ingredients prepared and weighed out in advance.

Heston let his imagination run wild to create an unusual twist on a Christmas classic.

A whole candied clementine hidden in the centre which infuses the entire pudding with strong citrus notes.

The pudding is priced at £13.99 but the high demand has led it to be sold on ebay for £250.

The 
Waitrose deal paired Miss Smith, an outspoken critic of celebrity chefs 
who champion pretentious and fussy food, with three-Michelin starred Fat
Duck chef Mr Blumenthal, 46, famed for his offbeat concoctions such as 
snail porridge.

It is not known how much both were paid but their annual fees are thought to run into six figures.

Confirmation
that cookery’s most unlikely double act has reached its sell-by date 
came yesterday in a Waitrose statement saying Miss Smith’s contract with
them finishes next month when they will be bidding her a ‘fond 
farewell’.

A spokesman 
said: ‘Delia has other major projects and  commitments coming up in 2013
and so, by mutual agreement, her contract will finish in February 
2013.’

Calls to Miss 
Smith’s manager were yesterday responded to by Waitrose. Sources said 
details of her new projects are likely to be revealed in the ‘next few 
weeks’.

Waitrose marketing 
director Rupert Thomas said: ‘It has  been such a fantastic experience 
working together and we have been really appreciative of the work Delia 
has done with Waitrose.’ 

Both
Miss Smith and Mr Blumenthal signed three-year contracts with Waitrose 
in March 2010 to take part in a campaign costing £10million. 

The
partnership was also a first for Waitrose, which had never before used 
celebrity chefs to boost sales. In the campaign, the two personalities 
encouraged customers to cook meals from scratch and created recipe 
cards.

They waived their fees for a low-budget Christmas advert so that the money could go to the retailer’s own community charities.

Miss Smith’s departure was announced just days after  Waitrose revealed record festive sales.

The Blumenthal-created Hidden Sauce Figgy Pudding and Christmas Cake were among the store’s top-sellers.
