Guilty: Melanie Smith has been convicted of killing her neighbours by setting fire to their home

A woman who started a fire which killed five members of the same family – including three children under five – was facing life in jail last night after being convicted of murder.

Melanie Smith, 43, set fire to a baby’s pushchair because she was fed up with it being outside her front door.

But the blaze spread into a devastating inferno which ripped through the first-floor flat in Prestatyn, North Wales, last October.

It trapped and killed Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, her partner Liam Timbrell, 23, their baby son Charlie, 15 months, Miss Shiers’s nephew Bailey, four, and niece Skye, two.

Jobless Smith, who lived in the flat below, was yesterday convicted by a 10-2 majority of five counts of murder, making her one of the most prolific murderesses in modern British history. She will be sentenced next month.

Her ex-husband, Paul Smith, said the killer ‘deserves to rot in hell’.

Smith collapsed in tears at Mold Crown Court after the jury returned their verdicts. She sobbed ‘Oh my God, no’ when the first verdict of murder was returned.

The victims’ relatives in the packed public gallery gasped ‘Yes!’ when the foreman announced the verdicts.

The jury was told that as the fire took hold, Mr Timbrell was heard in the background of a 999 call screaming: ‘Oh my God, oh my God, we’re going to die.’

Despite being badly burned, Mr Timbrell managed to tell police that he heard  Smith shouting through the letterbox: ‘I’m going to burn your house down.’

After the case, Lee-Anna’s parents Joy, 45, and Peter, 64, told of their relief. Mrs Shiers said: ‘I am overjoyed.

'I am sorry for her  family because we have always got on well with them. All our family are so happy at the verdicts.’

Young love: Ms Shiers' described the couple as 'heroes' would would have done anything to save the children

Her husband added: ‘Nothing will bring
them back but we have at least seen justice served. There is a big hole
in our lives and how do we fill that hole? It is just impossible.’

The Daily Mail can reveal that Smith had a history of cruelty to her own children.

She stubbed cigarettes out on her 
baby son’s forehead, hacked off her toddler daughter’s blonde hair, 
scalded her with boiling water and locked her in an understairs cupboard
as punishment.

Tragic: Skye Allen, two, and her brother Bailey , four, who were killed in the fire in the first-floor flat in 
Prestatyn

Deaths: Ms Shiers, left, and her 15-month-old son Charlie were both killed following the blaze set by Smith

One of Melanie Smith's victims made a harrowing 999 call from the burning building and was heard shouting: 'Oh my God, oh my God, we're going to die.'

The jury in her murder trial heard a recording of Liam Timbrell's call to emergency services, in which he said: 'Help, help. Someone has put it on purpose. We're inside the flat.'

Mr Timbrell, the only person from inside the flat who could give an account of the fire, later told rescuing paramedics that 'it was arson' and 'it was Mel from downstairs'.

He was very badly burned but became alert and awake, and said: 'Babies, are the babies okay?'

He then added: 'I heard a woman shouting in the street.'

Asked by the paramedics what he meant, he replied: '"I'm going to set fire to the house" - yes, yes I heard this woman shouting she was going to set fire to the house.'

Mr Timbrell repeatedly said 'Mel did it,' and told a police community support officer: 'She was shouting through the letterbox, "I'm going to burn your house down."'

Asked if he recognised the voice, Mr Timbrell said 'Yes', adding: 'It was Mel from the downstairs flat.'

Mr Smith, 51, said she inflicted 
terrible cruelty on the three children they had together, before 
abandoning them aged three, two and nine months.

He said: ‘She destroyed my family 
years ago, and by setting fire to that house she’s ruined the lives of 
so many other people.

'The sentence is totally deserved and none of us 
ever want to see her again.

‘She was an appalling mother to her 
own children, and now she’s done this to these other kids.

'It’s 
horrific. That evil woman deserves to rot in hell.’

Born in the seaside town of Prestatyn, Smith was 17 when she married Mr Smith. Over the next few years they had three children.

Mr Smith said his ex-wife resented being tied down to three young children and regularly mistreated them.

One of Smith’s daughters, Charlotte, 
now 23 and a mother of one, said: ‘It shocked me to know what she’d 
done, but it’s not out of character.

'She was cruel to us as kids, so why
shouldn’t she be cruel to other kids years later?

‘She was a mother from hell to me – 
and she still is. Spending the rest of her life in prison won’t come 
close to what she deserves.’

Mr Smith added: ‘I shudder when I 
think that Melanie will probably spend the rest of her days in prison, 
but she’s brought it on herself.

‘She’ll go down in history as a  notorious killer.’

Innocent: Bailey and Skye were staying with their aunt, Ms Shiers, at the time of the killing

Relief: The children's parents celebrated after the guilty verdict was delivered today

Self-confessed alcohol 'binger' 
Melanie Smith had a 'propensity' to make drunken threats to burn 
people's houses down 'with their children inside'.

Mold Crown Court was told of numerous
occasions when Smith threatened to set fire to property and how in the 
six weeks before the fire she stepped up her campaign of threats against
Lee-Anna Shiers.

In late 2007, Smith was barred from the Victoria Hotel in Prestatyn for being 'loud and argumentative', the court was told.

In April 2008 Smith and her boyfriend Steven Clarkson were again refused service at the pub by the landlady.

Smith's response was to say: 'I'm going to f****** torch this place', and to storm out of the door in a temper, the court heard.

Threats: Smith, pictured outside court last week, repeatedly said she wanted to burn down people's houses

The court heard Smith 'hated' Samantha Schofield, whom she claimed had been having an affair with Clarkson.

In August 2012 Smith 'trashed' Mr Clarkson's car while it was parked outside Ms Schofield's house.

The windscreen wipers were bent back, the wing mirrors kicked out of position and pink milkshake thrown at the windscreen.

Around 20 matches were also strewn 
around the road outside Ms Schofield's house and a matchbox was found 
beneath Mr Clarkson's car.

Smith then had two conversations with Ms Schofield's sister, Amy, in which she said she was 'going to set fire to Sam's house'.

Smith said that she had nearly set fire to the house but was 'too drunk to ignite the matches'.

When it was pointed out to her that 
Ms Schofield had children living with her who 'had done nothing wrong', 
Smith replied: 'I'm not finished with Sammy yet and I can't make any 
promises.'

Fire: The smoke-damaged property in Prestatyn after the blaze which killed five people last year

On September 1 2012, Smith told Ms Shiers's friend Stacey Brady that she was going to 'make Lee-Anna's life hell'.

The court heard Smith was 'ranting' 
about her throwing cigarette butts and shouted up at Ms Shiers: 'I am 
going to set your house on fire with you and your kids in it.'

On September 5 Ms Shiers' brother, 
Michael, called to see his sister and she told him that when the 
defendant was drunk she made threats to burn her house down, saying: 'I 
have threatened to burn someone else's house down and I will do the same
to you.'

The manager of the Vegas Bar in Rhyl,
Yvette Giblin, told police that on October 13 she heard the defendant 
rowing with Clarkson.

She claims Smith said in a raised 
voice: 'You're shagging the woman upstairs. I will burn the house down 
with her and the kids in it.'

On October 18 2012, Smith told her 
friend Pamela Handley she was going to 'torch or bomb' her landlord's 
flat and that he was not going to get any money from her rent.

On the morning of October 19, Smith 
went to Chantelle's hair salon where hairdresser Sophie Griffiths 
noticed she smelled of alcohol and was complaining about her flat.

She said it was too small and that 
she did not like her neighbours or landlord, adding: 'To be honest, I 
wish they'd burn it to the ground because the council would have to put 
me up then.'
