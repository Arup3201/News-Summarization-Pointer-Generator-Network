Vincent Kompany lost his place in the Manchester City team following a dressing-room row with Fernandinho.

Sportsmail understands the pair were involved in a heated exchange that threatened to boil over at half-time during their 2-1 defeat at Liverpool.

A City insider told Sportsmail: 'Fernandinho had a bit of a go at Vinnie and he went right back at him. He was raging and didn't take well to the criticism. Others had to get involved to stop it getting worse.'

Tempers flared shortly after Manuel Pellegrini's men returned to the Anfield dressing room with the score at 1-1, according to the Mirror.

Liverpool had opened the scoring when Fernandinho sold Kompany short and Philippe Coutinho nipped in before Jordan Henderson struck from long-range.

A source told the paper team-mates feared the pair would come to blows after Fernandinho criticised his captain for his part in the goal.

Kompany is said to have reacted furiously before Pellegrini told the Belgium centre-half that he should listen to his team-mate.

The 28-year-old is then reported to have reacted even more angrily before rounding on anyone who challenged him.

Kompany, who signed a new five-year contract last summer following a 2008 move from Hamburg, was an unused substitute for the following match, a 2-0 win over bottom-of-the-table Leicester City, with Pellegrini claiming he needed to freshen his side up.

Brazilian Fernandinho, a £34m signing from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013, was left out of the squad altogether.

Manchester City declined to comment on the incident. However, they are understood to be happy that there is no lingering animosity, believe the row was over as quickly as it started and are of the opinion that it was similar to disagreements that happen on a regular basis in dressing rooms across the country.

They are also keen to point out that it had nothing to do with Kompany not playing the next game. 

The Premier League champions are currently five points behind leaders Chelsea, who have a game in hand.

They travel to Burnley in Saturday's late kick-off.
