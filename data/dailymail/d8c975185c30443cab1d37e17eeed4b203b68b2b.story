Scots will be able to buy fish and chips every day for 10 weeks with the money they save by voting 'No' to independence, the Government has claimed.

Last week the Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander claimed there was a 'UK dividend' worth £1,400 for every Scot by staying in the union.

Now the Scotland Office has released a list of 12 things that Scots will be able to buy with the cash - each illustrated using lego characters and published online.

Scots will be able to eat fish and chips every day for 10 weeks if they vote 'No' to independence, according to the Government in London. But the SNP have rejected claims that there is a 'UK Dividend' of £1,400 for staying in the union

According to the Government, Scots will be able to 'scoff 280 hotdogs' at the Edinburgh Festival, drink more than 600 coffees or get a hair cut every month for three and a half years.

The bizarre press release sparked ridicule online - with one person writing on Twitter that it was 'proof if any were needed that UK Govt takes Scots for mugs'.

SNP MP Pete Wishart joked: 'They may take our lives but they'll never take our, err, lego.' 

It also threatens to overshadow a speech by the Business Secretary Vince Cable in Glasgow today.

Mr Cable is expected to claim credit for economic growth in Scotland in a bid to convince voters to stay in the UK.

He will say: 'Since May 2010, when the coalition came to power, unemployment has dropped by 40,000 - 54,000 lower than the peak in 2012 - and an extra

First Minister Alex Salmond claims independence would leave Scots £600 a year better off

148,000 people are now in work.

'This hasn't happened by accident. The coalition has taken various steps to make the job market fairer, to improve opportunities and minimise exploitation.

'Our efforts apply to Scotland as they do to Wales, Northern Ireland and England.'

His speech will focus on the business case for a vote against Scottish independence in the referendum this September.

Leaving the UK would hold back efforts to raise living standards, he is expected to claim.

'To continue job creation, to raise living standards across the UK, we need balanced economic growth to maintain business confidence and to encourage investment,' he will say.

'I don't believe Scottish independence can sustain these conditions as effectively and efficiently as the UK.'

But SNP Treasury spokesman Stewart Hosie said: 'Scotland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, richer per head than the UK, France and Japan.

'With a "Yes" vote we can make this wealth work for all the people and put Scotland first, in contrast to the Westminster system obsessed with London, which even the UK Government now admit harms Scotland's economy.'

But according to the Government, Scots will be £1,400 worse off by walking away from the UK. The Scotland Office published its list on-line yesterday.

The Government report claims: 'New financial analysis from HM Treasury shows that every one of us in Scotland will be £1400 better off every year staying part of the UK than we would be if we voted for independence.

'But how far does £1400 go? Here are 12 examples:'

1. An overseas holiday for two with cash leftover for sun cream. (Average cost: £680 per person for a 10-day jaunt.)

2. Pay for Christmas presents twice over, with some money left over to spend on Hogmanay celebrations. (Average spend on Christmas in Scotland: £610.)

3. Hop on the bus between Glasgow and Edinburgh (and back) 127 times. That’s the equivalent of a daily commute for more than 5 and half months. (Average cost: £11 for a return ticket.)

4. Scoff 280 hotdogs at the Edinburgh Festival. (Average cost: £5.)

5. Cover your family’s yearly shoe habit for about the next 6 years. (Average annual household spend on footwear in Scotland: £234.)

6. Fill up your fuel tank for the whole year with money leftover for an MOT and a few trips to the car wash. (Average household spend on petrol/diesel for personal transport in Scotland: £1123.20, average MOT costs: £29.65- £124.50.)

7. Watch Aberdeen play all season with two mates – with a few pies and Bovrils thrown in for good measure. (Average cost: £425 for one 2014/15 main stand season ticket.)

8. Experience 636 joyful caffeine highs. (Average cost: £2.20 for a medium cappuccino.)

9. Share a meal of fish and chips with your family every day for around 10 weeks, with a couple of portions of mushy peas thrown in. (Average cost of fish and chips in UK: £4.74 per portion, based on family of 4 sharing meal.)

10. Go for one haircut a month for over 3 and half years…you can go for significantly more if you’re a man! (Average spend for women per haircut: £29.99.)

11. Pay off your energy bills in full over the year. (Average household cost in Scotland: £1211.60 per year.)

12. And finally, you’ll still have enough left over for endless hugs with everyone to celebrate being in a United Kingdom. (And if you’re still in need of a reason to smile, go to Inverness – it’s the second happiest place in the UK.)
