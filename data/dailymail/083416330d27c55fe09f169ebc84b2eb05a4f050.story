An office manager who stole nearly £100,000 from her clients to pay for a boob job and a sports car will only have to give around a quarter of the money back.

Louise Hitchen, 27, swindled £96,620 while working at a PPI claims firm and was jailed for 12 months in May.

The mother-of-one diverted the funds to her own bank account on 15 different occasions, and spent £3,000 on breast enhancement during a downward spiral into drink and drug abuse.

Hitchen, from Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, also blew thousands of pounds of clients' cash on holidays to Holland and Ghana, an abortion, online shopping and a Vauxhall Astra convertible.

A proceeds of crime hearing at Liverpool Crown Court heard that Hitchens, who worked for Hardwick Financial Solutions, in Wigan, had assets worth £23,849 and had paid this money back in an out-of-court settlement.

At her sentencing in May, a jury heard how Hitchen's offending began when she secretly transferred £3,000 funds to her own bank account to pay for an abortion.

Greed quickly took over and by the time her fraud came to light she had already left the firm having taken £93,000.

The company had to halt plans for expansion and 10 members of staff were laid off as a result.

Jailing her, Judge Robert Warnock said 'A significant driving force behind this fraud was greed and the wish to artificially boost her own self-esteem.'

When she joined the company in March 2011 she was described as “keen and enthusiastic”, but by July the following year her performance had deteriorated and she was subject to disciplinary proceedings.

Hitchen spent £3,000 of the stolen money on breast enlargement, and was jailed in May for 12 months

Hitchen's 'The Only Way is Essex' lifestyle drew the attention of her boss because she was spending fare more than she earned, but she told him her boyfriend was sending her money from overseas

Her line manager became suspicious when she started living a 'The Only Way is Essex' lifestyle, buying a car, having her breasts enlarged and buying clothes online, but Hitchen claimed her boyfriend worked overseas and was sending her cash.

She left the company in October 2012, but in December that year a client complained that they had not been paid out and investigations revealed that the cash had gone into Hitchen’s payroll bank account.

Hitchen claimed it had been 'a one-off', but inquires showed more payments totalling £28,574.

She paid £20,000 back then, as well as handing over her car. 

In March 2013 another client complained that they had not been paid out and it was found that Hitchen had diverted other funds to herself but destroyed the audit trail. It was only then that the full extent of her fraud was revealed.

The company, Hardwick Financial Solutions (offices pictured), had to lay off 10 staff because of the lost money

Speaking after the sentencing in May, Detective Constable Mark Edwards, from Greater Manchester Police, said: 'In the space of about four months Louise Hitchen stole close to £100,000.

'With the exception of the cosmetic surgery and car - which has since been returned - Louise Hitchen frittered away much of the cash on shopping sprees and trips out.

'The cost to Hardwick Financial Solutions LTD has been significant and has included staff losing their jobs but the only person Louise thought about while she had her "hand in the till" was herself.'
