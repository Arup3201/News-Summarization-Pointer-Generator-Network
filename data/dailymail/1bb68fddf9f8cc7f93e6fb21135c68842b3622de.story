Police have launched an investigation after shocking video footage emerged of a steward repeatedly punching a rugby league fan during a frenzied attack.

David Farthman was left battered and bruised following a barrage of blows from the security guard as chaos erupted during the tense Super League clash between Widnes Vikings and Warrington Wolves after a smoke bomb was thrown onto the pitch.

Mr Farthman's friend captured the sickening moment on his mobile phone, as the unidentified steward, recognisable in a high-visibility vest, lashed out at the 30-year-old several times while his colleague held him down.

Attack: The sickening moment rugby fan David Farthman was repeatedly punched by a steward at the Widnes Vikings and Warrington Wolves game in August

Investigation: Cheshire police have launched an investigation after footage of the beating hit 40,000 views on YouTube

The assault came after a smoke bomb was thrown onto the pitch at the Halliwell Jones Stadium during the tense Super League clash, causing chaos on the stands

The lifelong Vikings' fan insists he is lucky to be alive after the attack, which left him with serious concussion and a sprained wrist.

He said: 'He could have hit me in the right place and the right time and I could be dead. He shouldn’t be getting away with it.

'He could do it again and kill somebody. It is not just for my safety - he shouldn’t go unpunished.

'I have made a statement to the police. Hopefully it will be pursued.

'I
was angry because I had just paid to get into the match, brought one 
drink then quickly into the match was kicked out. He was just hitting me
in the head for no reason. It was just shocking.'

Mr Farthman believes that the steward falsely assumed he was the one who launched the smoke bomb.

He
adds: 'They must have thought I had thrown the smoke bomb. My mates 
were trying to keep me in the stand and the stewards were trying to take
me out. This steward started laying into me. He must have hit me about 
10 times without me hitting him.

Mistaken: The victim believes he was wrongly targeted by the steward over a smoke bomb which exploded on the pitch

'I
couldn’t defend myself. I had my hands held behind my back and I 
managed to get my right hand from behind my back to cushion the blows. 
It was relentless. I thought I was going to get knocked out. He was 
tall, he looked like a typical bouncer and had a skin head - the 
stereotypical bouncer look.'

The video taken during the match at Halliwell Jones Stadium in Warrington on August 15 has racked up almost 40,000 hits on YouTube, and sparked a series of angry outbursts from rugby fans on forums and social networking sites.

Cheshire Police have been made aware of the footage and and have launched an investigation.

A statement from the force reads: 'We are aware of video footage circulating on the internet. The matter is being investigated and officers are currently reviewing all information available to establish if any criminal offences are identified. Anyone with any information is urged to call Cheshire Police on 101.'

Five fans were arrested after the match in connection to crowd trouble. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old will appear at Halton Magistrates Court in Runcorn next month.
