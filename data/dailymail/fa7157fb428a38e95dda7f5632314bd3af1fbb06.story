A former high class escort - rated among the top one per cent in her field by The Erotic Review, 'the Yelp of the commercial sex world' - has detailed her carefully calculated strategies. 

Svetlana Z, as she refers to herself, moved to New York from Chelyabinsk, Russia, when she was 19 years old and had $300 to her name. Lured by the promise of quick money, she entered the escort industry and soon made a small fortune by catering to investment bankers, 90per cent of them married.

'Mostly, I offered understanding,' she wrote for Medium. 'The truth is, even for guys who hire me for three or four hours, the sex usually only takes about 15 minutes.' Not bad for $1,000 an hour.

Svetlana - who describes herself as 5ft 7in, 119lbs, with long legs, hazel eyes, full lips and a slender figure -  remarks that when it did come to sex, however short-lived, massaging her client's ego was key.

Around 98per cent of men wanted to perform oral sex on her, and 80per cent of them would ask if she'd had an orgasm, or insist she had multiple orgasms before they did. This wasn't about her pleasure, of course, it was their need to 'prove themselves.'

Svetlana faked orgasms with relative ease and presumably on nearly every occasion. Her mind, she says, was always in business mode. 

She refers to one instance in which a client asked to pour honey all over her before they had sex. She agreed - but only after he agreed to pay triple her hourly rate - and she spent the whole rampant session mulling over cleaning the sheets and re-doing her hair and make-up.

With regards to her beauty regime, Svetlana cut no corners. She admits she 'didn't each much,' employed a personal trainer and had manicures and pedicures - always red, 'any other color is taking a risk' - at least twice a week. 

Her mascara cost her $130, her eye shadow, foundation and lipstick cost $50 a pop, regular hair appointments cost $200, lingerie sets cost $600, not to mention the clothes and shoes. 

One of Svetlana's biggest overheads were the ads she placed on Eros.com; the 'best' site for high-class escorts and '$2,000-an-hour porn stars,' who pay a base fee of $400 a month to be listed. 

Svetlana, evidently a shrewd businesswoman, found that by representing herself, she didn't have to pay an agent the standard 30-40per cent of her fee. 

Instead, she spent almost $4,000 a month buying up the most prominent spaces on Eros.com, and flooding the 'featured' and 'what's new' spotlights with her profile.

She spent 'at least $3,000' on monthly rent for a Manhattan-based apartment in which to entertain clients, as the sorts of clients she was pulling in were hardly going to travel to cheaper areas like Brooklyn or Queens. 

Initially, Svetlana didn't give much thought to how she presented herself in her ads, beyond commissioning expensive photo shoots so she looked her best. She quickly learned to up her game, however. 

'What I know now is that guys want to know the women they’re f*****g. It surprised me, but a lot of them - most of them - really need to feel a sort of connection,' she writes. 'I always wondered why Playboy ran those little interviews with the girls alongside the photos. 

'Now I know. The guys who are j*****g off want to feel like they know the girl.'

When it came to her ethnicity, Svetlana was seemingly born lucky. 'White girls' charge the most in the business, followed by 'Spanish girls,' then 'Asians' and then 'black girls.'

'Men here - especially American men - have certain ideas about certain nationalities,' she writes. 'If you’re a South American girl, then you’re wild, you’re fun, and you love to f**k. 

'If you’re Asian, you’re bad! You’re freaky, and you’ll do anything, and you’ll want to do more!... Russians are hot, but also icy and mean... American girls... sometimes have cute ponytails and big smiles, but guys think they’re sort of selfish and bitchy, too.'

Svetlana built herself two personas to advertise to men; Anna - was more 'shy' and 'passionate,' and Angelina was 'fun and playful.'

Svetlana made herself available 12 hours a day, from noon until midnight, 'rarely' drank, 'never' took drugs, 'always' used condoms and demanded payment in advance - although, she says, it's best to pretend the envelope 'doesn't exist.'

She made it a rule never to ask men about their families, but remarks that it's surprising how often they 'brag' about their kids. Most importantly of all, amid the hours and hours of chatter, she never opened up about her own problems.

'A billionaire doesn't understand what s****y problems I have,' she writes. 'It’s bad business.  A guy will complain to you over and over, but he doesn't want to hear your complaints. I promise you that.'

Svetlana was highly tactful when it came to demanding the best. Rather than appear spoiled in her requests to fly first class while travelling with clients, she would weave silky allusions into the conversation. 

For example, she would claim that her 'really long legs' would get cramped in coach, which would hinder her 'flexibility' and thus affect her 'd***y-style' performance. 

In addition to clients that - quite literally - came and went, Svetlana had a fair few long-term arrangements too. One 62-year-old client, divorced and with cancer, would pay her a $20,000-a-month retainer for two full days and nights every week. 

Eventually, he proposed marriage, and promised a hefty inheritance from his will, but Svetlana declined.

Svetlana has never been raped, drugged or done porn. She claims she doesn't 'hate men,' has never had a pimp and doesn't suffer from 'daddy issues' or a difficult childhood. 

And perhaps in part to her dogged attention to detail and her carefully considered approach, she managed to avoid any dangerous or traumatic experiences.

When she once caught a client attempting to videotape them having sex on the sly, she simply grabbed his phone, erased the footage, and told him to 'get the hell out' of her apartment. 

Another threatened to call the cops on her if she didn't give him free sex, so she threatened to post his phone number to a gay escort listing.

Young guys are 'bad,' virgins are 'awful,' and 'young virgins' were a 'nightmare' - but not because they were scary or dangerous, just woefully off-beat, Svetlana says. 

Then there was the client who had sex with her for a full hour straight, all the while making 'woo woo woo' train noises. 

Aside from these mentions, life as a high-class escort appears to have suited Svetlana. Couples were her favorite sorts of clients, and she got to charge double the fee for the same amount - often less - of work. 

'That's the cool thing about capitalism,' she points out. 

Eventually, Svetlana gave up her career and said goodbye to Anna and Angelina. She has saved up $200,000 over the past five years, and is currently studying film-making and psychology. 

She has had one boyfriend since she quit her former job, a banker ironically, but it didn't work out. 

And she has traded Eros.com in for sites like OkCupid and Match.com, in the hopes of one day marrying and having children.

Svetlana has no regrets about her life as an escort, and even misses certain aspects of it. But from now, she's freshly minted and carving herself out a new - and very different - sort of American dream.
