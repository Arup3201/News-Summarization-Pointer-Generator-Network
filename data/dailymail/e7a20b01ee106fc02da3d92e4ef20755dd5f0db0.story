A haul of sporting memorabilia bought by a career criminal is set to fetch hundreds of thousands of pounds after police seized the vast collection.

Police hope to raise over £670,000 by auctioning off the prized sports collection of one of Britain's most notorious fraudsters - including Wayne Rooney’s boots and a signed Maradona football shirt.

Thomas Scragg, 57, was jailed for 17 years after leading one of the biggest scams in British history in July 2010.

The career criminal spent thousands of pounds of his ill-gotten gains on sporting memorabilia - including Wayne Rooney’s boots from the 2007 FA Cup Final.

Scragg also bought a Manchester United shirt from the 1963 FA Cup Final signed by club legends Dennis Law, Bobby Charlton and the late George Best worth £2,500.

The sports-fan - who had snooker player Jimmy White as best man at his wedding - splashed out £3,000 on autographed pictures of Muhammad Ali and Brazil legend Pele.

On July 8, 2010, police seized the valuables along with £200,000 worth of jewellery he gave to his girlfriend.

Scragg also had a David Morris diamond suite necklace, earrings worth £70,000 in his home in Solihull, West Midlands.

As well as his prized collection of 
signed football shirts, police also discovered wads of £50 notes bundled
together and kept in drawers along with dozens of expensive gold 
watches.

The items - valued at around £675,000 - have sat in West Midlands Police storerooms since 2008 when they were seized from Scragg's country house

They were found along with stacks of costly Louis Vitton, Gucci and Dior handbags and shoes.

Scragg spent £14 million living a champagne lifestyle in glitzy London hotels and restaurants as well as splashing out on a fleet of luxury cars.

The racket saw Scragg, 56, use his business Moya Payroll, which managed the wages of construction firm staff, to siphon off £26million in tax from 2002 to 2007.

Workers would be paid in cash without deductions for tax being made, while VAT for work carried out by the construction firms – many of which were set up by Scragg – also went unaccounted.

He would also include false expenses which affected his tax payments.

Another investigation by West Midlands Police uncovered a further £8 million of stolen PAYE tax in a 10-month period from April 2007 to February 2008.

Scragg’s empire collapsed and the criminal inquiry led to the convictions of 12 co-conspirators who helped him carry out the fraud.

His accomplices laundered the cash in such a way as not to raise the suspicion of the authorities.

Scragg was jailed for 13 years in November 2010 and was given a further four years in March 2011 - making it the second-longest sentence ever received in the UK for a white-collar crime.

West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service obtained the proceeds of crime order on behalf of HMRC, which had brought Scragg to justice following the probe - named Operation Digit.

The lots, which have been in West Midlands Police storerooms since 2008, are expected to fetch at least £675,000.

All the goods are now set to be auctioned by police at Wilsons Auctions in Birmingham to help raise £1 million for local good causes.

Detective Sergeant Derek Tinsley, from the Regional Asset Recovery Team (RART), said:

'Tommy Scragg thought he had everything, the money, the lifestyle and the celebrity friends, but he lost it all when the law finally caught up with him.

'It’s our job to ensure Scragg never gets to reap the rewards of ripping-off the taxpayer and that the public are compensated for his crimes, which is why, when he was convicted, we seized all of his assets which we’ve now been given permission to sell off.

'His penchant for expensive jewellery, boxing and football means we’ve got a whole selection of unique items to sell at auction which I’m sure will generate a lot of interest from prospective buyers.

'Hopefully it will also send yet another message to Tommy Scragg and any other potential fraudsters that crime simply doesn’t pay.

'Confiscation and forfeiture orders made against criminals strike right at the heart of the principal motivation for organised crime minus the money.

'We will never rest on our laurels as we continue to seek new opportunities to remove assets from offenders.'

A video cataloguing Scragg’s vast collection of luxury cars and sporting memorabilia was released yesterday by West Midlands Police.

Full details of the auction can be found on the auction house’s website www.wilsonsauctions.com in the coming days.

Bidders can purchase the items by attending the auction in person or on-line using Wilsons ‘Live-Bid’ facility; details of how to register are also available on the company’s website on December 12.
