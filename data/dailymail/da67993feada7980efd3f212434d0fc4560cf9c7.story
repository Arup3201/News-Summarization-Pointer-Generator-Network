He is twice-divorced - so it's no surprise that Mick Jagger would admit: 'I don't really think that much of marriage'.

But that did not mean the Rolling Stones frontman was not devoted to L'Wren Scott, his statuesque girlfriend of 13 years.

Indeed, in 2007, Jagger, now 70, picked out a vintage diamond ring that signified the fact he expected to spend the rest of his life with the 6ft 3ins tall brunette, also twice-divorced, MailOnline can reveal.

Today, the New York City medical examiner's confirmed that L'Wren, 49, had committed suicide by hanging herself at her Manhattan apartment on Monday.

The ring that said it all: L'Wren Scott had been wearing a massive diamond ring on her engagement finger since 2007

And speaking about her romance with Jagger, a friend told MailOnline today: 'Mick gave L'Wren the ring as a sign of his devotion. I know it was a vintage ring that he picked out himself, but they were very quiet about it, they never discussed it in public - it was just private for them.'

Worn on her tell-tale ring finger, L'Wren first showed off the huge rock when the couple were seen enjoying a string of performances at a folk festival in Rajasthan in India in October 2007.

Neither would comment at the time on an engagement, but a friend confirmed they were never engaged.

L'Wren told how Jagger indulged her passion for antique jewelry and once enthused to Vogue: 'Talk about someone who knows about jewelry - and the most fabulous taste!'

She was seen wearing the ring at what would be her last public appearance on December 2 at the British Fashion Awards at the London Coliseum in London.

The former model turned fashion designer was known to have been previously married to property developer Anthony Brand, a short-lived union that lasted from 1992 until 1996, when their divorce was finalised in California.

However, MailOnline has learned she was also married for a second time before meeting Jagger at a photo shoot in 2001.

In an emotional interview, L'Wren's adopted sister Jan Shane told how L'Wren admitted 'I envy you' at their father Ivan's funeral in 2002, adding: 'I know deep down she wanted a family 
and kids, and I think she deeply wanted it and couldn't get it. I think 
it bothered her.'

‘To me she had it all,’ said Jan, 
fighting to hold back tears as she spoke in the kitchen of her 
comfortable family home in Sandy, Utah.

The mother-of-eight, who has been married for most of her life to a garbageman, added: 'She was going out 
with a Rolling Stone and travelling to London and all around the world 
and I was a stay-at-home mum who hasn’t really been anywhere.’

While Lupe Montufar, who worked as 
L'Wren's housekeeper in Los Angeles between 1993 and 2009, told the New 
York Daily News that the designer tolerated Jagger’s infidelity in the 
hope of one day having a family with him: 'She wanted to get married and
 have a family, but she didn’t want to get her hopes up or say it out 
loud to Mick. She didn’t want to pressure him.

'She
 always dreamed about having fame, fortune and money. She had all that 
in her hands with him. She sacrificed a lot to be with him. A few years 
ago, she thought she’d be with him forever and have a family. She knew 
there were other women, but she accepted it.'

When asked about her desire for children in 2010, L'Wren dodged the question, saying: 'Let me 
see if I can articulate this in a way that makes sense.'

'I 
have seven wonderful sort of children in my life, by default. I have 
four fabulous grandchildren. I feel that being the product of adoption 
is a wonderful thing, and at the moment my life is saturated with 
children. My family life is a high priority.”

Jagger and L'Wren shared a $10 million home in London and a stunning apartment on the Left Bank in Paris.

And asked how her daughter had won the notorious Mick Jagger, L'Wren's adopted mother Lula Bambrough said in 2003: 'L'Wren
 is very independent and would not take any nonsense from anyone no 
matter how famous they were.

'She usually knows what she wants and she gets it. It
 doesn't surprise me at all that she's tamed Mick. She is very much her 
own woman and it would be my guess that is why this Mick Jagger likes 
her.'

Even Jagger's second wife, Texan supermodel Jerry Hall would later admit: 'I think she's better at dealing with him than I am.'

The singer first wed Nicaraguan-born Bianca Perez-Mora Macias in 1971 in St Tropez in the South of France, although the day was marred when he made a scene because Bianca refused to sign a pre-nuptial agreement.

The marriage was effectively over after a year, though the couple stayed together for the sake of their daughter, Jade.

When
 Bianca finally divorced Jagger in 1979, smart work by his lawyers kept 
her settlement at only around $1.6million (£1 million).

He then wed Jerry Hall in a Balinese woodcarver’s hut in 1990.

The
 breaking point with Jerry was his affair with the Brazilian model 
Luciana Morad, which resulted in a son, Lucas.

When Jerry sued for 
divorce, having by then had four children by Jagger, he crassly claimed 
their Balinese wedding was legally invalid, and so the marriage was 
annulled ‘by mutual agreement’.

However, Jerry's rumoured settlement of $7.4 million (£4.5 million) made her the first Jagger ex to describe him as ‘very, very
 generous’.

So it's no surprise, that speaking in 2010, Jagger told the New York Times: 'I don’t really subscribe to a completely normal view of what relationships should be.'

'I have a bit more of a bohemian view.
 To be honest, I don’t really think much of marriage. I’m not saying 
it’s not a wonderful thing and people shouldn’t do it, but it’s not for 
me. And not for quite a few other people too, it would appear.'

He laughed: 'I just think it’s perhaps not quite what it’s cracked up to be. I know it’s an elaborate fantasy.'

L'Wren's body was found by her assistant at 10am on Monday. Jagger is said to be en route to New from Australia, where he was touring with the Rolling Stones.

The tour of Australia and New Zealand has now been postponed and today the band's spokesman was forced to deny that Jagger had left his longtime love at home during the tour because his bandmates felt she was their 'Yoko Ono' - calling reports by PageSix 'ridiculous'.

Jerry Hall had four children with Jagger - and managed to walk away from their marriage with a $7.4million settlement
