Food poisoning affects one in six Americans every year caused by rotting meat and vegetables, dirty water and unhygienic kitchens. 

But a new technique using just electricity and water could one day make food safer, without damaging the environment.

Researchers claim that tiny nano-sized droplets of electrically charged water filled with free radicals could be sprayed onto food to kill pathogens lurking on the surface.

Scientists at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts believe that with more research, droplets called Engineered Water Nanostructures (EWNS) could replace current methods used to disinfect food, such as applying mild solutions of bleaches and chlorine.

‘Fruit and vegetables can become contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms anywhere in their production chain, starting from the field or orchard, during harvest, transport, processing, distribution, and marketing, or during preparation in food-service establishments and in the home(from farm to fork route),’ the scientists write in their study, published in the journal of Environmental Science and Technology.

‘Possible pathogen sources include contaminated irrigation water, animals, birds, insects, soil, manure, and infected workers/food handlers.’

Depending on how long fruit and vegetables were exposed to the spray of nanoparticles, lab tests showed that between 80 and 98 per cent of bacteria were destroyed. An SEM image of E. coli is shown

Think of food poisoning and you may immediately consider raw meat to be the culprit.

But raw or minimally processed fruit and vegetables can be a source of pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites the study said.

Every year in the US, approximately 48 million people get sick, 128,000 are hospitalised, and 3,000 die of foodborne diseases.

Between 1990 and 2005, contaminated fresh produce accounted for 13 per cent of all reported food borne outbreaks and for 21 per cent of reported illnesses.

In Europe, fresh produce of non-animal origin accounted for 10 per cent of the outbreaks, 26 per cent of the cases, 35 per cent of the hospitalisations, and 46 per cent of deaths between years 2007−2011, according to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). 

To create the charged droplets, which measure just 25 nanometres, the team led by Philip Demokritou, sprayed water though a strong electrical field - a technique known as electrospraying.

The water molecules split into hydroxyl and superoxide radicals, which are usually unstable, Environmental Technology reported. 

But in the electrospray, a thin layer of charged water captures the radicals and stabilises them.

The electrical charge serves to boost each droplet’s surface tension so that it stops the radicals evaporating.

‘EWNS possess unique properties; they are 25 nm in diameter, remain airborne in indoor conditions for hours, contain Reactive Oxygen Species and have very strong surface charge,’ the study said.

To test the efficiency of process, three strains of bacteria known to cause illness - E. coli, Salmonella and Listeria - were applied to tomatoes and stainless steel surfaces.

Tomatoes were then sprayed with nanoparticles in an enclosed chamber for between 30 and 45 minutes, while the steel samples were exposed for 15 to 45 minutes.

Scientists believe that with more research, droplets called Engineered Water Nanostructures (EWNS) could replace current methods used to disinfect food, such as applying mild solutions of bleaches and chlorine. They tested their technique on tomatoes (stock picture shown)

Depending on how long fruit and vegetables were exposed to the spray of nanoparticles, lab tests showed that between 80 and 98 per cent of bacteria were destroyed.

The study added: ‘The results presented here indicate that this novel, chemical-free, and environmentally friendly intervention method holds potential for development and application in the food industry, as a “green” alternative to existing disinfection methods.’

The scientists claim that the charged water does not change the taste or texture of food.

However, it could be years before it can be used to treat produce sold in supermarkets because current rules stipulate that treatments must kill 99.999 per cent of bacteria.
