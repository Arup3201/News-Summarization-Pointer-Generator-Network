A campaigning MP hit out furiously today after it emerged Rolf Harris still holds a CBE six months after he was convicted of paedophile offences.

Government officials were accused of 'insulting' his victims by failing to strip the disgraced Australian entertainer of the honour awarded by the Queen.

Critics contrasted the treatment of Harris – once among the Queen's favourite entertainers - with that of Stuart Hall, the former It's a Knockout host who lost his OBE four months after he was jailed for a string of child sex offences.

Harris, 84, was jailed for almost six years last July  for 12 attacks on girls as young as eight.

Jurors were told Harris was a predator with a fixation on under-age girls. He carried out indecent assaults on girls between 1968 and 1986 - including a catalogue of abuse against his daughter's friend over 16 years.

In the aftermath of his convictions, Government sources suggested it was highly likely he would be stripped of the CBE awarded to him in 2006. He previously held an MBE and OBE.

But six months on, nothing has happened.

Although the jury was unanimous in its verdicts on Harris, and the artist/performer was subsequently stripped of his prestigious BAFTA Fellowship, officials have mysteriously hesitated over whether to remove his CBE.

Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who wrote an acclaimed book on the Cyril Smith child sex scandal, told the Mail: 'There should have been no hesitation in taking his honour off him.

'Harris is an evil person who has abused children.

'Allowing him to keep his honour a day longer than necessary is an insult to his victims. It is absolutely awful. He has shattered so many lives and the last thing the authorities should do is allow him to keep his honour.

'Harris should face the full humiliation of having his CBE taken away forthwith. I will be raising this matter in the House of Commons.'

The Cabinet Office refused to comment on Harris's case, in keeping with its policy of not discussing individuals, but precedent confirms honours are forfeited in circumstances where the person is jailed for more than three months or considered to have brought the system into disrepute.

A recommendation is typically made by Whitehall's honours and appointments secretariat to the forfeiture committee to revoke an honour if a person has been found guilty of a serious criminal offence.

The Mail understands that one possible reason for the delay in removing Harris's CBE is his insistence that he is innocent.

In November the paedophile, who painted the Queen's portrait and sang at her Diamond Jubilee celebrations, lost the first round of a bid to appeal against his convictions. The Judicial Office confirmed that permission to appeal had been refused by a single judge. 

However the Australian had the option of renewing the application before three judges at the Court of Appeal, or referring his case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

Hit out furiously... Campaigning Labour MP Simon Danczuk told the Mail: 'There should have been no hesitation in taking his honour off him.

Harris's victims included a young autograph hunter, two girls in their early teens and a friend of his daughter's against whom he committed a catalogue of abuse over several years.

One victim said the abuse had taken away her 'childhood innocence'.

Mr Justice Sweeney said upon sentencing that Harris took advantage of his celebrity status and had shown 'no remorse'.

Attorney General Jeremy Wright decided in July not to refer Harris's sentence to the Court of Appeal despite 150 complaints over its 'leniency'.

He said he did not think judges would find it to be unduly lenient and increase it.

Former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne's ex-wife Vicky Pryce was stripped of the Companion of the Order of the Bath she was awarded in 2009 when she was a senior civil servant in the Government.

The Queen removed the honour after Pryce was jailed for eight months for perverting the course of justice after taking speeding points in 2003 for her then husband.

Boxer 'Prince' Naseem Hamed lost his MBE after being jailed over a high speed car crash in his £300,000 McLaren Mercedes in 2005.

Jockey Lester Piggott, meanwhile was convicted in 1987 of tax fraud which led to him spending one year and one day in prison, and was stripped of the OBE.

Recipients of honours can also lose them if they are censured or struck off by a professional or regulatory body for something relevant to their honour, or if they are judged to have brought the system into disrepute.

Harris was first honoured in the late 1960s with an MBE, followed by an OBE a decade later, and a CBE in 2006.

In 2005, the Queen sat for Harris while he painted her portrait, commissioned by the BBC to mark her 80th birthday. Then in 2012 Harris was one of the star performers at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

Failure to remove the honour is unlike the treatment of other criminals

It could be because the Australian still protests his innocence
