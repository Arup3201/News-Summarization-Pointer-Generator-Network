The remains of a man who spent the last year on the run from authorities in the murders of his wife and two daughters were discovered Sunday in Petrolia, Calif.

Shane Miller's body was found on the banks of the Mattole River, and identified with dental records. Authorities are not yet certain how long the remains had been there.

Miller's case was recently featured on an episode of CNN's 'The Hunt,' a show looking for tips on fugitives.

The show recounted how a 911 dispatcher answered a May 7, 2013 call from the Miller house then reported hearing breathing, weeping, and loud bangs before the line cut out.

Police arrived to find the corpses of Miller's two daughters - Shelby, 8, and Shasta, 5, - and wife, Sandy Miller.

Each victim had been shot multiple times.

Miller, his dog, and truck were nowhere to be found.

Miller was last suspected to be fleeing on foot through California forests after abandoning his truck

His disappearance led to a nationwide manhunt as authorities searched for their top suspect in the triple homicide.

He was last seen by an ex-girlfriend in Petrolia.

After that, authorities last knowledge of him was that he'd abandoned his truck and tried to escape capture by traveling on foot through California's 'Lost Coast' forests.
