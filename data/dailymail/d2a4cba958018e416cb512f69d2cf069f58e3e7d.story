Elizabeth Scarrott, 28 (pictured outside court), was pregnant when she joined Shereene Warrington, 32, in confronting their ex-boyfriend Christian Plumley

A love rat who was seeing three different women was confronted by the mother of his unborn child and another ex-girlfriend after the pair discovered his new affair, a court heard.

Pregnant Elizabeth Scarrott, 28, and Shereene Warrington, 32, are said to have joined forces before driving 130 miles from Gloucestershire to Devon to confront their former boyfriend Christian Plumley, 27.

The pair hammered on the door of his new girlfriend's terraced home in Newton Abbot as terrified Mr Plumley cowered behind the curtains and shouted: 'She's going to get her head kicked in.'

Warrington, a mother, then allegedly produced an axe from under the car seat and smashed the windscreen of Mr Plumley's grey Peugeot 206, causing £600 of damage.

The two women then got back into their VW Golf and sped out of the cul-de-sac before driving for two hours back to Gloucestershire.

The tangled love life - including the fact that Scarrott and Mr Plumley are now engaged with a child - was outlined to magistrates in Torquay, Devon, yesterday.

Scarrott, who was pregnant at the time of the attack but has since given birth, admitted one count of causing another person harassment, alarm or distress with intent and was given a 12-month probation order.

Warrington, of Dursley, Gloucestershire, has not yet entered a plea to charges of using threatening words and behaviour with intent, criminal damage and possession of an axe in public.

At yesterday's court hearing for Scarrott, Nicholas Bradley, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant travelled down from Gloucestershire to Newton Abbot. 

'She had previously been in a relationship with Mr Plumley. She was pregnant with his child.

'The attack related to Mr Plumley's behaviour to do with a relationship with another girl. Scarrott was very upset.'

Alistair James, mitigating, said Scarrott, of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was dealing with personal issues and is actually a 'candid' and 'reasonably intelligent' girl. 

'She did not come down to cause trouble,' he said. 'She does accept, however, that in the highly emotive environment words were said and it became a public order incident.

'In the heat of the moment she got herself into a foolish situation.'

On his Facebook page shortly after the incident on June 15, Mr Plumley described the attack as a 'result ov a snake in the grass' (sic).

However, after patching up their differences Scarrott got engaged to Mr Plumley and she gave birth to their son on June 29, just two weeks after the incident.

On her Facebook page, Scarrott said that she could not wait to marry Mr Plumley.

She wrote: 'I have finally after all these years found my sole (sic) mate, my best friend and love of my life.

'It's bin ups and downs and sometimes a hard road. But all it's made me realise is haw (sic) much I love this man and the hard times just made us stronger.

'No one is perfect. But I love every imperfection of his. He has given me my third amazing son and there is nothing I wouldent do for him (sic).'

District Judge Kevin Gray ordered Scarrott to pay £85 in court costs and a £60 victim surcharge.

He said: 'This was an incident where clearly you have travelled and we all know the reason why.

'Clearly there has been a making up and that clearly is relevant.'
