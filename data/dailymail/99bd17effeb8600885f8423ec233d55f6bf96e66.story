Disruptive pupils who wreck the schooling of millions will be given an ‘unambiguous lesson in who’s boss’, the Education Secretary vowed yesterday.

In a new war on ill discipline in the classroom, Michael Gove will loosen rules on the use of physical force by teachers and increase penalties for parents who allow their children to play truant. 

The tough measures are part of a crusade to ‘restore adult authority’ over what Mr Gove described as an ‘educational underclass’.

I'm the boss: Teachers will be put firmly back in charge of the classroom under new measures introduced yesterday, which aim to 'restore adult authority'. (Posed by models)

He said respect for adults had been ‘subverted by a culture of dutiless rights’ which encouraged the young to ignore civilised boundaries.

In a strongly worded speech, the Education Secretary said last month’s riots had highlighted the growing gulf between what he called a ‘hard-working majority’ and a ‘vicious, lawless, immoral minority’.

He insisted it was clear that Britain’s social malaise had its roots in the breakdown of discipline in the home and the classroom.

New war: Michael Gove has unveiled a number of powers for teaching staff in a bid to improve discipline in the nation's schools

Mr Gove said there was an ‘iron-clad link between illiteracy, disruption, truancy, exclusion and crime’ which the Government must try to break. Measures to hand back powers to teaching staff and improve discipline include:

Mr Gove, in a speech at an academy school in South London, said the culture of children’s rights had been twisted to undermine adult authorities.

‘The right every child deserves, to be taught properly, is currently undermined by the twisting of rights by a minority who need to be taught an unambiguous lesson in who’s boss,’ he said.

Many pupils were failed in primary schools because their behaviour was not policed with proper boundaries and they were not taught how to read properly.

By the time they arrived in secondary school, they were unable to follow the curriculum and covered up their failure with shows of bravado and disruption.

‘For all the advances we have made and are making in education, we still, every year, allow thousands more children to join an educational underclass. They are the lost souls our school system has failed,’ Mr Gove said.

‘It is from that underclass that gangs draw their recruits, young offenders’ institutions find their inmates and prisons replenish their cells.

‘These are young people who, whatever the material circumstances which surround them, grow up in the direst poverty – with a poverty of ambition, a poverty of discipline, a poverty of soul.

‘I recognise that using a word like underclass has potentially controversial connotations. It can seem to divide society into them and us. But I believe there’s a merit in plain speaking.’

Mr Gove said problems began even before school, with primary teachers reporting increasing numbers of children arriving at school  ‘totally unprepared to learn’, unable to hold a pencil, unable to sit and listen, unable to use the lavatory and, in some cases, unable to  communicate.

Inappropriate: Andy Burham, Labour's education spokesman, said he did not think it was helpful for Mr Gove to talk of an educational underclass

‘Some express their frustration through displays of inarticulate rage,’ he said.

Mr Gove said the latest figures showed that 1,200 children aged seven or under had been permanently excluded from primary schools for violence or other disruptive behaviour in the past five years.

A further 53,000 in the same age group were suspended.

The Education Secretary said regulations brought in by Labour on the use of force were inhibiting teachers’ judgement.

‘So let me be crystal clear, if any parent now hears a school say, “Sorry, we can’t physically touch the students”, then that school is wrong. Plain wrong. The rules of the game have changed,’ he said.

And on truancy, he revealed that more than a million children are absent for 10 per cent of the school year. ‘We need to review the sanctions schools, police, the courts and the Government have available,’ he insisted.

Responding to the speech, Labour’s education spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘I don’t think it’s at all  helpful for the Education Secretary to talk of an educational underclass.’
