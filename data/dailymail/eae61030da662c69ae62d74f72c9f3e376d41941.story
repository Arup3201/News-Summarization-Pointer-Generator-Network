They’re among the most fearsome predators in the animal kingdom.

Not that one would have guessed it from this display.

When a pride of lions became involved in a stand-off with a family of elephants, they quickly decided it was a battle they weren't going to win.

One of the lions ended up scrambling up a tree in an effort to escape the charging elephants

Instead of putting up a fight, they had no choice but to flee to rampaging elephants, which were attempting to protect one of their young calves.

Rose Hipwood, from the Luxury Safari Company, and Kyle Branch, from the Sausage Tree Safari Camp, watched as the event unfolded during a safari trip in the Lower Zambezi National Park in Zambia.

Mr Branch said: ‘We spotted the pride of twelve fast asleep in the shade of the winter-thorn trees... a peaceful scene until a herd of elephants with a tiny calf arrived from a mid-day mud wallow.

‘The herd would have been extra sensitive to any predators, because of the presence of the young calf, and were agitated as they approached from a long way off to investigate the lions scent that was blowing towards the herd.

‘The matriarch eventually spotted a camouflaged lioness close to our vehicle and the games began.

‘I repositioned the vehicle so we weren't part of the fleeing lion pride and watched as the whole elephant herd made sure who the real king of the jungle is! Lions are quicker than elephants thank goodness and none of them were hurt.

‘Eventually the elephant herd calmed down and moved off to feed.

‘The lions promptly sat down and went to sleep again, except for one of the 14-month-old cubs, who had climbed a small tree and was pretending to be a leaf.

‘Once he had made sure the elephants had gone he re-joined the pride to sleep.’

Ms Hipwood added: ‘Close encounters with big game are thrilling and exciting.

‘We got caught in the middle of a herd of elephants chasing 12 lions as the sun set on the Lower Zambezi - an unforgettable experience.’
