The Queen will not attend Nelson 
Mandela's funeral after being advised to scale back on long haul 
travel but send the Prince of Wales instead, it was confirmed today.

Buckingham Palace said Prince Charles will represent the British monarchy at the memorial events in South Africa commemorating the Nobel Peace Prize-winner's life.

Prime Minister David Cameron said on Twitter today he will also fly out for the service.

The Queen, meanwhile, is expected to pay tribute to the revered statesman at a service at Westminster 
Abbey, after reluctantly making the decision not to fly to South Africa.

Charles, who has made several visits to South Africa, is understood to have sent a private letter of condolence to Mr Mandela's widow Graca Machel following his death last week.

The Duchess of Cornwall will not be accompanying him to the funeral, a Clarence House spokeswoman said.

Mr Cameron wrote on Twitter: 'I'll be at the memorial service in South Africa on Tuesday to commemorate the great man. #RIPMandela.'

The official memorial service will take place at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg, the South African government said.

A message on the government website said it would be attended by members of the public as well as heads of state.

'This will give ordinary people and public leaders an opportunity to celebrate Madiba's life collectively,' they said in the statement, using the clan name Mr Mandela was affectionately known by.

A state funeral will be held days 
later, with the South African government saying 'a funeral service and 
interment ceremony will take place at President Mandela's home and final
 resting place at Qunu in the Eastern Cape.'

A
 national service of thanksgiving for the life of Mr Mandela will be 
held after the state funeral on Sunday - the first ceremony of its kind 
at the Abbey for a non-British citizen.

A book of condolence has also opened at St Margaret's Church at the Abbey.

Three American presidents will attend memorial services for Mr Mandela this week, alongside an estimated 140 heads of state.

The Queen
discussed plans for the ceremony to Mr Mandela as early as June, according to The 
People.

She is also believed to have telephoned him a number of times since he was taken seriously ill in the summer.

The pair had a strong relationship and Queen Elizabeth first met Mr Mandela in 1991 and received him again in 1996.

During the state visit, the South African president called her 'this gracious lady' and she also praised 'this wonderful man'.

A statement from 
Buckingham Palace said after his death was announced on Thursday: 'The 
Queen was deeply saddened to learn of the death of Nelson Mandela last 
night.

'He worked tirelessly for the good of his country, and his legacy is the peaceful South Africa we see today.

'Her
 Majesty remembers with great warmth her meetings with Mr Mandela and 
sends her sincere condolences to his family and the people of South 
Africa at this very sad time.'

The memorial, expected to last ten days, will be an unparalleled event in South Africa’s history.

The
 White House said President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama 
would be joined on Air Force One next week by former president George 
Bush and his wife Laura.

A Bush spokesman said the couple 'gratefully accepted' the invitation from the Obamas.

Bill
 Clinton is also travelling to South Africa, along with his wife, former
 secretary of state Hillary Clinton, but it was unclear whether they 
would also fly on Air Force One.

Former President Bill Clinton is also set to attend the state funeral and will be joined by Hilary Clinton

Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who met with then-94-year-old Mandela last August, will also journey to South Africa

'My whole family will be there,' Mr Clinton said. 'And we're looking forward to having the chance to say goodbye one last time.'

President
 Obama also invited 89-year-old George Bush senior to travel with him to
 South Africa, but a spokesman for the former president said he would 
not be able to make the trip.

A
 memorial service for Mr Mandela, 95, will be held 
on Tuesday at a stadium in Johannesburg, followed by a smaller funeral 
in his home town.

Desmond Tutu, a long-time friend of Mr
 Mandela and former archbishop of Cape Town is expected to hold the 
service and David Cameron will also attend.

Religious leaders such as Pope Francis and the Dalai Lama are also expected to attend the services.

A host of celebrities who had personal ties to the great leader are also expected to travel to South Africa. 

Naomi
 Campbell, who said Mr Mandela was her 'honorary grandfather, U2's Bono, Oprah Winfrey, and Bill Gates, who has campaigned for AIDs awareness in Africa, are 
likely to attend the memorials.

Preparations for the funeral are expected to bring the country of 53 million to a virtual standstill.

The
 sheer number of dignitaries, including numerous heads of state, is sure
 to spell a logistical nightmare for the South African government, which
 will be tasked with providing air-tight security during the solemn 
event.

Those planning Mr Mandela's funeral include the former president's family, the federal government, the military and the African National Congress party.

Despite some prior planning by authorities as Mr Mandela grew frail and suffered bouts of hospitalisation in recent years, many of the details remain up in the air.

It is unclear which ceremony world leaders will attend, either Tuesday's stadium memorial or the planned funeral service on December 15 in Qunu, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate's rural hometown in Eastern Cape Province.

His body will rest in state on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, the seat of government power in South Africa's capital.

Mourners will walk up the steps into the Union Buildings' amphitheatre and file past Mr Mandela's body.

ANC members will hold a ceremony on December 14 at Waterkloof Air Force Base near Pretoria before Mr Mandela's body is flown to Qunu from there, Mr Chabane added.

Sunday has been declared a national day of prayer and reflection over Mr Mandela's death.
