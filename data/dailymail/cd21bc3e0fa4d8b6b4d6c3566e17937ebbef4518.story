An obese takeaway addict whose ankles were buckling under his 20 stone bulk has shed six stone - by eating Chinese food.

Builder Matt Riggs, 35, piled on the pounds when his business was hit by the recession and he started binge eating for comfort.

But he realised he had to change when he went to his GP with a suspected broken ankle but was told there was no break - he was just too heavy.

Matt Riggs lost six stone in four months by cooking himself healthy versions of his favourite Chinese meals. He says at one point he was losing a pound a day. He is pictured (left) before his weight loss and (right) now

The dad-of-one had just started working in a Chinese takeaway restaurant and realised that if he took out fat he would be left with delicious, healthy food.

He has now only eaten noodles and rice for four months and has lost an impressive six stone.

Mr Riggs said: ‘I knew I had to sort my life out. I was eating far too many takeaways.

‘I noticed that many of the customers were overweight and was confused why the chefs at the Chinese were slim.

‘I watched the way they cooked the food they ate themselves.

‘It was basically the same but without the fat.

Mr Riggs (pictured with his daughter, Cherry) weighed 20 stone before he changed his diet and he was so heavy that his ankles were being damaged. He now weighs 14 stone

‘I had hardly ever cooked before, I would just get a takeaway or chuck something in the microwave.

‘But now I love cooking and have really enjoyed inventing my own recipes.

‘I was losing a pound every day when I first started.

‘People give up on other diets because they can't face lettuce or the other things you have to eat.

‘But with my diet you get to eat the food you like - just cooked healthily.’

At his heaviest Mr Riggs, from Bournemouth, Dorset, tipped the scales at a hefty 20st 5lbs.

But thanks to his new eating regime - which allows him cereal for breakfast and Rivita for lunch - he has now slimmed down to 14 stone.

By swapping Chinese takeaways for home cooked versions, Mr Riggs has more than halved his fat intake.

Each day he has one of his favourite Chinese dishes such as chicken chow mein, chilli chicken, Kung Po chicken or chicken chow.

Mr Riggs (pictured before his weight loss) believes that he has now halved his daily fat intake

An average takeaway chicken chow mein has 860 calories and 30g fat, but a home-cooked version can have just 458 calories with 15.8g fat.

Mr Riggs says he has a second dieting secret - he always eats his main meal of the day before 5pm so his body has time to burn off the calories before he goes to bed.

He says his wife Mel, 33, and daughter Cherry, one, have both been delighted with his new trim look.

Before he went on a diet, Mr Riggs would have toast or a cooked breakfast in the morning then grab a supermarket sandwich or fast food for lunch.

In the evening he would occasionally put a steak in the oven, but most of the time he stuck to microwave meals or takeaways.

He would also down up to ten cans of lager a night.

Nutrition scientist Dr Aine O'Connor, from the British Nutrition Foundation, said: 'When you're eating out or buying food that has been prepared for you, it's often easy to have more fat, salt and calories than you realise.'
