A Project Runway: All Stars contestant recreated the Givenchy Haute Couture gown worn by Oscar nominee Rosamund Pike at last night's Academy Awards ceremony - in just five hours.

Sonjia Williams, 27, from Boston, worked through the night in order to finish the design, which was modeled by Today show host Natalie Morales during this morning's broadcast.

'I picked up a couple of fabrics [before the ceremony aired],' the designer explained to Today anchor Savannah Guthrie.

Spot the difference: Today show host Natalie Morales (L) modeled a copy of the Givenchy Haute Couture gown worn by Rosamund Pike (R) at last night's Oscars 

It's in the detail: While designer Sonjia Williams did not have access to the same kind of lace fabric used on the original Givenchy design, she copied every other aspect of the gown, including the scalloped neckline

The real deal: Rosamund's dress was viewed by many as one of the highlights of last night's red carpet

Hard at work: Sonjia, pictured in the Today show studio, admitted that she had worked through the night in order to finish her design

'I thought I was bound to see something red on the red carpet, obviously. I didn't have any lace but I had this red leather leftover and I thought that it would give that same look that you can see with the detailing on the side and on the belt. 

'So I used that and then did the scalloping detail on the neckline, and we have a close enough dress of what it would have been for me to have done it in five or six hours.'

While the dress was not an exact replica of the beautifully-detailed lace-embellished gown worn by Rosamund last night, both Savannah and Natalie agreed that Sonjia had done the best job possible with the materials that she had available. 

'We should say that Rosamund Pike's dress is a Givenchy dress, I mean it's fabulous and beautiful,' Savannah said, before asking Sonjia: 'You did this in how many hours?

'Five hours, I haven't slept!' the reality star admitted.  

She added: 'I didn't have the fabric, I didn't really know how I was going to make a dress that had the same look the way that the lace detailing is. You know [this material] is red crepe, it's not anything close to that fabric. 

The big reveal: Both Natalie (pictured) and Savannah Guthrie were thrilled with the final result

Leading lady: Rosamund was nominated for the Best Actress award for her role in Gone Girl at last night's ceremony, but lost out to Still Alice star Julianne Moore

Sewing star: Sonjia took to her Instagram account on Monday morning to thank the Today show for inviting her to take part in the challenge

'But I think me having that red leather that really kind of made that pop with the color so you can see at least the detailing and it stands out.'

Despite the frantic rush to get the design finished and fitted in time for Natalie to wear it on the show, Sonjia confessed that she had a great time taking part in the challenge - and took to Instagram shortly after appearing on the show to thank the Today team for having her. 

'Thanks @todayshow for having me this morning!' she commented alongside an image of herself sitting in the studio with her sewing machine. 

'I haven't slept since 7am yesterday but it was totally worth it.'

While Rosamund, who was nominated for Best Actress for her role in thriller Gone Girl, did not take home a coveted statue at the end of the ceremony last night, the starlet and her beautifully-ornate gown were hailed by many as being among the top red carpet winners of the evening. 

'Rosamund Pike absolutely slaying in @givenchy. How did she JUST have a kid?' one Twitter user commented, while another added: 'Rosamund Pike's dress?! WOW. Just wow.'
