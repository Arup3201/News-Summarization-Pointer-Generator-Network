Present: Firebox have advertised the giant confectionery as a 'beloved concoction of roasted peanuts, nougat and caramel'

A Snickers - previously known as a Marathon before the name was changed 23 years ago - contains roasted peanuts, nougat, and caramel, covered in milk chocolate.

Ben Redhead, from Firebox.com, said: 'We're pretty big fans of giant confectionary, so we jumped at the chance to stock this behemoth bar.

'Who needs Christmas pudding when you've got this tucked away in the kitchen?

'It'll be the gift that keeps on giving for Snickers fans through Christmas and beyond.'

The huge bar measures 25cm (9.8 inches) long, 6.5cm (2.6 inches) wide, and 4.5cm (1.8 inches) high.

Firebox say it is 'perfect' as it is, but have also suggested their customers to try it deep fried.
