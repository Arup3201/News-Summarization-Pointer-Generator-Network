It is a new way to ensure your phone is always charged - and one that doesn't require a wall socket.

A German firm has revealed a pocket charger which contains its own fuel cell.

It runs on gas usually used in lighters, converted into electricity by the internal fuel cell.

Each refuel takes three seconds, and can charge 11 iPhones fully

The system converts standard camping gas or lighter gas – cheaply available all over the world – directly into electricity. 

The highly efficient device is easily refilled again and again in just three seconds the firm says, and each refuel can charge 11 iPhones.

German company eZelleron Inc., based in Dresden, has developed the new charger which can power  smartphones, tablets or even GoPro cameras

The firm says it is a 'quantum leap in terms of performance and availability compared to conventional battery chargers.'

'Kraftwerk really is a small portable power station,' it says.

'The handy and extremely lightweight device provides reliable power anytime, anywhere, and absolutely never needs to be connected to an electricity supply or a power outlet.'

'With just one charge of gas it makes the user completely independent for weeks.'

Already available in a range of flawlessly functional prototypes, eZelleron Inc. wants to launch kraftwerk on the market in November/December 2015

A capable partner for mass production has already been found. 

In order to fund the necessary steps until then – including two comprehensive test phases – the company has now launched a campaign on the crowd-funding platform Kickstarter.
