A woman who called police after seeing a young child left alone in a hot car was allegedly run over by the boy's angry mom - and may never walk again.

Shannon Dominguez was on the phone to police when she had a confrontation with 27-year-old Kristina Riddell.

The 43-year-old was hit by Riddell's Honda car and left with a back injury with doctors warning she might never walk again.

'Every day is a chore. Every day is stressful,' said Dominguez, whose left leg was crushed in the June 7 incident.

She is now wheelchair bound and faces months of rehabilitation to try and walk again.

Collared: Kristina Riddell, 27, was later arrested and charged with hit and run, assault and child abuse

Dominguez told Fox 31 News she was outside a store in Longmont, Colorado, when she saw a small boy alone in a car.

Fearing he might be overcome by the heat she called police.

The boy's mother mother Riddell allegedly became angry when she realized police had been called.

She punched Dominguez's boyfriend, Alan Mason, before running the couple over with her white Honda.

Mason was thrown over the hood while Dominguez's leg was crushed under the wheels of the car.

Riddell sped off, but was later arrested and charged with multiple offenses.

Mason said: 'She had her windows down, so I grabbed onto the door. She drug me about 20 feet. I realized she was not going to stop, so I let go. I tumbled in the parking lot.'

Doctors said Mason suffered internal and external bruising.

Dominguez said she had no regrets about calling for help as she feared the boy could die from being in a baking-hot car.

'All four windows were rolled up. And it was in the direct sun. It scares the heck out of me. It's some innocent child might die,' Dominguez told the station.

She added that next time she might call 911 and leave rather than wait around, but added: 'If it means helping a child, I'd do it in a heartbeat.'

Riddell was arrested at her home in Longmont.

She was charged with hit-and-run, assault and child abuse.

Fox 13 said she has an extensive criminal record, including arrests for assault, domestic violence and multiple driving violations.
