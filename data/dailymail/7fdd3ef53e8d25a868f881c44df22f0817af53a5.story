Sentenced: Jose David Diaz-Marrero was sentenced to eight years for burglarizing a home and snorting what he believed was crushed pills and were actually human and canine ashes

A man who was convicted of breaking into a Florida home and snorting the ashes of two dogs and an elderly man has been sentenced to eight years in prison.

Jose David Diaz-Marrero, 20, broke into a home in Silver Springs Shores in 2010, and stole two urns that contained the remains of the homeowner’s father and two Great Danes.

He and fellow alleged burglars, Waldo Soroa, 21, and Matrix Andaluz, 19, reportedly snorted the remains, thinking they were crushed pills.

They were horrified to find out days later when they watched a news report that they had actually snorted ashes.

Diaz-Marrero pleaded guilty to burglarizing the house in June. He and his accomplices were also accused of stealing $1,500 worth of jewellery and laptop computers.

Appearing in court last Friday, he apologized for what he did. ‘I recognize that I made a big mistake,’ he told Judge Sandra Edwards-Stephens, according to Ocala.com.

‘I wish the victims were here so that I could tell them how sorry I am,’ he said.

The urns contained the remains of homeowner Holli Tencza’s father, as well as her two purebred Great Danes, Epic and Samson.

Diaz-Marrero will spend the next eight years in prison, and will pay Ms Tencza $9,000 in restitution.

Once they realised their error, the suspects discussed returning the remaining ashes but threw them in a lake instead because they thought their fingerprints were on the containers, said police

They, along with two juveniles who cannot be named, allegedly stole the cremated remains of the man and two dogs.

According to reports, they believed the ashes to be drugs.

Investigators learned what happened to the ashes after they arrested five teens in connection with another burglary attempt at a nearby home.

'The suspects mistook the ashes for either cocaine or heroin.

It was soon discovered that the suspects snorted some of the ashes believing they were snorting cocaine,' the sheriff's report said.

Police divers were trying to recover the ashes.

The suspects were jailed on numerous burglary and other charges.
