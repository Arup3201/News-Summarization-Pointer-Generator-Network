Andy Fraser, who co-wrote the rousing rock anthem All Right Now when he was the teenage bassist for the British rock band Free, has died in California at age 62.

Fraser had been living in the Southern California desert community of Temecula, where he died Monday, the Riverside County coroner said in a statement. The cause of death is  under investigation, but it was known that he had been battling HIV and cancer.

He was reportedly found in his car by his gardener.Â

At age 15, the London-born Fraser briefly became a member of John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers. The group functioned as a training ground for young British rockers including Eric Clapton and Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor.

Within a year, Fraser became a founding member of Free. The band's most prominent member was singer and guitarist Paul Rodgers, who would also go on to front Bad Company and The Firm.

The band's biggest hit by far was 1970's 'All Right Now,' which remains one of the defining hits of classic rock radio. Fraser also produced the track and plays a bass solo on it.

Fraser kept playing music for most of his life, but he would never equal the success he had as a teen with Free, which broke up in 1972

The song is also a staple of football stadiums. The Stanford University and University of Southern California marching bands each play it at virtually every game.

He and Rodgers took the stage together to play All Right Now at Woodstock '94, the reboot of the classic music festival.
