The mother of one of the British teenage victims of the Zanzibar acid attacks revealed today how she was struggling to come to terms with why someone could do ‘something so evil’.

Nicola Gee, of Hampstead, north London, whose daughter Katie Gee, 18, was splashed with battery acid while volunteering on the African island, said the family faces an ‘extremely long journey’.

The girl’s friend Kirstie Trup, also 18, is now recovering at home with her family after three days at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in Central London, while Katie was due to undergo surgery.

Mrs Gee told BBC News: ‘This whole 
thing is unexplained. It's difficult to think of someone doing something
so evil. This is an extremely long journey. It's very, very sensitive.’

It comes after Kirstie’s mother 
Rochelle Trup, 49, said yesterday: ‘Kirstie has been temporarily 
discharged until Thursday when she’s back in for a skin graft.’

The pair were attacked by two men on a
moped in Zanzibar City. They were flown to hospital in Dar es Salaam in
mainland Tanzania, then on to London.

Last night Zanzibar’s police said a 
third British woman was sent threats apparently from the same 
attackers. The unnamed 29-year-old insisted she would not stop her charity work
on the island.

Care: The two teenagers were both taken to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital after returning to the UK from Zanzibar on Friday

Temporary discharge: Miss Trup returned to her family home in Hampstead, North London, last night after being released from hospital ahead of skin graft procedures on Thursday

'Beyond imagination': The teenage girls were covered by sheets as they were escorted out of an ambulance and into the hospital on Friday

Members of both teenagers' families 
have been keeping a bedside vigil after the pair were flown home and 
immediately sent to London's regional burns centre.

One friend of the pair told how one of the two men involved in the unprovoked attack ‘smiled’ before throwing acid.

Speaking from Zanzibar, medical 
student Olivia Moore told Channel 4 News: ‘The two men were on a moped 
and they went past a group of tourists.

‘They stopped for the girls and the 
two men then looked at each other, nodded, and then the man on the back 
of the bike smiled and threw acid on the girls.

Attack: Two men on a moped hurled acid in the girls' faces as they walked to meet friends for dinner in Stone Town, Zanzibar (seen in a file photo)

‘From then on it's just chaotic. There
was no incident that preceded the actual attack. Everyone was shocked. 
Nobody can think of a motivation or anything that precipitated this.’

Katie has already taken to Twitter to 
thank well-wishers for their support, while a photograph released by the
teenagers' families showed the injuries one of them suffered in the 
attack.

The women were enjoying the last week 
of a trip as volunteer teachers to the predominantly Muslim island when 
the corrosive substance was thrown at them in an apparently unprovoked 
attack.

They had originally planned to return 
in time to collect their A-level results this week, with Kirstie hoping 
to study history at the University of Bristol while Katie is considering
the University of Leeds.
