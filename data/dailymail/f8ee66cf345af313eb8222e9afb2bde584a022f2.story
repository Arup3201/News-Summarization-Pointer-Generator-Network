A 20-year-old self-proclaimed 'pothead princess' from Florida tweeted the words '2 drunk 2 care' just hours before allegedly causing a horrific wrong-way crash that killed two young women.

Police say Kayla Mendoza, of Hallandale Beach, was the culprit in the Saturday night accident on Sawgrass Expressway that resulted in the deaths of Marisa Caran Catronio and Kaitlyn Nicole Ferrante.

Catronio was pronounced dead at the scene. Her friend was rushed to a hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries this morning.

Party girl: Kayla Mendoza, the 20-year-old self-proclaimed 'pothead princess' who posted photos of joints on her Twitter account, is allegedly responsible for a wrong-way crash that killed two women

Less than three hours before the wrong-way crash on November 17 last year, Mendoza tweeted that she was '2 drunk 2 care'

Addict: Mendoza's Twitter account is filled with posts about her marijuana habit

Evidence: The 20-year-old was not shy about sharing photos of weed

Mendoza, who remained in serious condition at an area hospital earlier this week, has not been shy about her suspected drug use and weakness for alcohol on Twitter, as Miami New Times first reported. 

Posting under the user name 'Kaila Mendoza,' the T-Mobile sales associate has fired off dozens of tweets about being high and rolling blunts.

Just after 11pm Saturday, less than three hours before the deadly collision, Mendoza posted a message that read: '2 drunk 2 care.'

Second fatality: Kaitlyn Ferrante passed away from her injuries in a hospital four days after the collision

In the days and weeks leading up to the crash, the 20-year-old graduate of Broward College lamented that her 'car permanently smells like weed,’ described her state as '2 high 2 care' and boasted about 'rolling a blunt in the airport parking lot.'

Her Twitter account, which has not been taken down as of Thursday evening, is also peppered with images of what appear to be marijuana cigarettes and piles of weed.

On November 9, Mendoza tweeted: 'Can't sleep without my bedtime blunt.'

A week earlier, she shared with her 631 followers: 'I really am so baked right now.'

Mendoza's Facebook page, however, paints a slightly different portrait of the Florida party girl.

Photos of the 20-year-old show a beaming, prim young woman with shiny black locks and conservative outfits.

Police have yet to charge Mendoza in connection to the deadly accident.

Victims: Marisa Caran Catronio, right, and her best friend Kaitlyn Nicole Ferrante, left, were both killed in the collision in the early hours of November 17 last year

Driver: Kayla Mendoza was allegedly driving the wrong way and hit the girls. She remains in serious condition

Catronio and Ferrante had been heading 
home to Coral Springs in Ferrante's 2012 Toyota Camry after a night on the town last Saturday when they were struck by a Hyundai Sonata driven by Kayla Maria Mendoza, according to police.

Mendoza was heading east in the westbound lanes when she slammed head-on into Catronio's red Camry driven by Ferrante west of University Drive.

According to news reports, the two friedns were out celebrating Catronio's 21st birthday.

Marisa was pronounced 
dead at the scene shortly after 1.45am. Both Ferrante and Mendoza were taken to 
Broward Health North, where the former passed away Thursday.

According to Florida Highway Patrol, Miss Ferrante sustained severe head injuries and had been kept on life support, CBS Miami reported.

Distraught: Marisa's father, Gary, sobbed as he said he would never be able to hug his daughter again

Loved: Mr Catronio is now calling on highways to install spikes or flashing lights to warn wrong-way drivers they are headed for danger. He is pictured with his daughter Marisa, whom he called 'full of life'

Catronio's father, Gary, has revealed that he and his wife made it to the scene of the accident on Sawgrass Expressway after tracking their daughter using a phone app.

'My little girl is not here anymore 
because of the negligence of a driver driving on the wrong side of the 
highway,' he told NBC. 'This has to be stopped. We've got to do 
something to prevent this.'

The victims' friends and members of their community have rallied around the girls' devastated families, holding candlelight vigils and fundraisers to help them in their hour of need.

'Full of life': The girls had been heading back from a night out when they were hit by the other car

Loved: Her brother shared these images on Facebook. She leaves behind two young brothers

Mr Catronio said Marisa, who worked at a pediatrics office, loved fashion and baking. She leaves behind her mother, Natalie, and brothers Jesse, 19, and Dustin, 17.

The family members paid tribute to Marisa on Facebook, sharing photos of the young woman.

Jesse wrote: 'Best big sister in the world! No one can ever replace you. You were always there for me and helped me through so much. I love you and you'll never be forgotten.'

Marisa's funeral will be held on Friday. var nbcLP={};nbcLP.aRandomNumber=Math.floor(Math.random()*10000);nbcLP.currentPageLoc=encodeURIComponent(window.location.href);nbcLP.currentSiteLoc=encodeURIComponent(window.location.host);nbcLP.defaultWidth=636;nbcLP.defaultHeight=367;nbcLP.cmsID="232327461";nbcLP.vidPid="VMmrC7qVj0OC";nbcLP.vidSec="TK";nbcLP.vidSubSec="TK";nbcLP.vidFrame=document.getElementById("nbcLP232327461");nbcLP.vidFrame.style.border="none";nbcLP.vidFrame.width=nbcLP.defaultWidth;nbcLP.vidFrame.height=nbcLP.defaultHeight;nbcLP.vidFrame.scrolling="no";nbcLP.vidFrame.src="http://www.nbcmiami.com/templates/nbc_partner_player?cmsID="+nbcLP.cmsID+"&videoID="+nbcLP.vidPid+"&width="+nbcLP.defaultWidth+"&height="+nbcLP.defaultHeight+"&sec="+nbcLP.vidSec+"&subsec="+nbcLP.vidSubSec+"&turl="+nbcLP.currentSiteLoc+"&ourl="+nbcLP.currentPageLoc+"&rand="+nbcLP.aRandomNumber;
