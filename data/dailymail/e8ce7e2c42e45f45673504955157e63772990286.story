Cristiano Ronaldo scored goal number 255 in his 250th game for Real Madrid but there were some whistles of discontent at Carlo Ancelotti’s side as they struggled to beat newly promoted Cordoba – a team who finished seventh in the second division last season.

Ronaldo’s late spectacular second for the European Champions after Karim Benzema’s first half strike put a gloss on what was a far from convincing first home performance of the season.

Discontent over the sale of Angel Di Maria, defeat in the Spanish Super Cup against Atletico Madrid, and the failure to sign Radamel Falcao increased the pressure on the European Champions to put on a show but they toiled for large parts against plucky minnows Cordoba. They might even have been pegged back at 1-1 had former Newcastle striker Xisco’s second half goal not been rubbed out for offside.

Benzema put Real Madrid ahead in the first half with his first goal for Real Madrid since a strike against Bayern Munich last April. The club is under pressure to sign another forward to compete with the Frenchman but Ancelotti has said that the squad is now complete and there will be no movement ahead of next Monday’s. Cristiano Ronaldo also had the ball in the net from an offside position after running on to Luca Modric pass.

The home side’s first chance came on three minutes when Gareth Bale’s free-kick sailed high over the Cordoba bar. The newly promoted side were playing their first game in top flight for 43 years and had brought 6,000 supporters with them. 

Ronaldo then claimed a penalty after a push from Jose Angel Crespo in the area but the referee waved away appeals and the visitors immediately had their first chance with Mike Havenaar shooting just past Iker Casillas right-hand post.

The Spain captain had been picked to start the game with new signing Keylor Navas left on the bench alongside Xabi Alonso, Asier Illaramendi, Sami Khedira, Isco and Rafael Varane – around 100m euros of surplus talent.

Real Madrid’s next chance came when Daniel Pinillos was booked for tripping Alvaro Arbeloa on the edge of the area. Luka Modric rolled the free-kick to Ronaldo whose drilled shot was saved by Juan Carlos.

Cordoba were playing without fear in their first game back in the big-time. They finished seventh in last season’s second division but were promoted because Barça’s B-team, who cannot be promoted, finished third giving their place in the play-offs to Cordoba.

Bale forced two corners and from the second the ball came out to Kroos whose shot failed to make it through the crowded area. The German tried again from distance and this time Juan Carlos had to get down smartly to make the save. 

Finally the deadlock was broken and predictably it came via the right foot of Kroos whose perfectly executed corner was headed home by Benzema.

The Frenchman needed a goal having not scored in preseason and with many fans still hoping Falcao is signed before deadline day to replace him in the starting line-up.

Cordoba finished the half strongly with Havenaar heading wide from a corner and their supporters chanted ‘yes we can’ as the two teams went down the tunnel. Madrid encouraged those away fans with a very slow start to the second half. Albert Ferrer’s side were quicker to everything although it was still Madrid who had the first real chance of the second 45 minutes with James Rodriguez going close to his first goal for his new club.

Madrid were still struggling to get into their stride and there were some whistles of discontent from supporters. The volume of the discontent went up when Cordoba put the ball in the Madrid net. Casillas palmed a Fidel shot straight out to Xisco who scored, but the former Newcastle striker was flagged offside and Real were off the hook.

James Rodriguez was replaced by Isco and one-time Arsenal target Sami Khedira, who now looks set to stay at the club, replaced Benzema as Carlo Ancelotti looked to add another body to midfield and play Bale and Ronaldo as a front two.

Ronaldo scored from an offside position running on to Kroos’ pass and then hammered in the second from all of 30-yards out but it was the Cordoba fans making most noise on the final whistle as Madrid fans filed away not convinced by their team’s first home showing of the season.
