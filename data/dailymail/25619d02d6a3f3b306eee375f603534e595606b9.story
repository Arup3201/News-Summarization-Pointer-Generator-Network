The New York townhouse where Andy Warhol painted some of his earliest Pop Art has gone on sale.

But the slim, 16.5ft-wide, five-storey house, located on Lexington Ave in New York's Upper East Side, is not quite the impoverished artists's studio.

It's on the market at a cool at $5.8million.

The living room: Andy Warhol bought this townhouse on Lexington Avenue in in 1959 for $60,000 and lived there for 15 years, sharing the Carnegie Hill-area home with his mother, Júlia. It is now on sale for nearly $5.8million

However, for the Warhol admirer, the place may be the ultimate collector's item.

The artist bought the home in 1959 for $60,000 and lived there for 15 years, sharing the Carnegie Hill-area home with his mother, Júlia.

It was during that time period that Warhol created some of his most iconic work, including colourful renditions of Campbell's soup cans, dollar bills and comic strips.

He used the house itself as his studio in the early Sixties, reportedly leaning canvases against a fireplace in one wood-panelled room.

Later he took his work to various other locations around the city, known as his 'factories', where assistants would controversially help him to create many of the masterpieces which bear his name.

The living room: He used the house itself as his studio in the early-Sixties, reportedly leaning canvases against a fireplace in one wood-panelled room, but later moved his work on to a series of 'factories' around the city

All mod cons: After Warhol's death, Edward J. Hughes, his business manager, bought the home for $593,000. Since then the house has passed through two owners and undergone small-scale renovations

Comfortable: Warhol's nephew, James Warhola recalled how, after arriving at his eccentric uncle's home late at night, he woke up in an upstairs bedroom stacked high with towers of Campbell's tins and Brillo cartons

The 3,072 sq/ft Manhattan townhouse, which opens straight onto busy Lexington Avenue, was originally built in 1889 to a design by Henry J. Hardenbergh, the same architect behind the plaza hotel and the Dakota.

At just 48ft deep and 16.5ft wide, it is smaller than many Upper East Side townhouses, most of which are about 100ft deep, according to city tax records cited by the Times.

It has four bedrooms, one en-suite, each with wood-burning fireplaces, four separate bathrooms, and a wood-panelled dining room.

Iconic: Warhol's famous Campbell's soup tins screenprint. The unifying element in Warhol's work is his deadpan Keatonesque style - artistically and personally affectless - which he also assumed in life

Warhol's nephew, James Warhola, wrote and illustrated a 2003 children's book called Uncle Andy's about a family visit to the Lexington Avenue home in the early-Sixties.

He told the New York Times when the house was last on the market in 2008 how, after arriving at his eccentric uncle's home late at night, he woke up in an upstairs bedroom stacked high with towers of Campbell's tins and Brillo cartons.

'I always thought the house should have been a museum,' he told the Times. 'All those important early Pop paintings are in museums scattered across the world.'

Warhol leased the home to Frederick W. Hughes, his business manager, in 1974. Fifteen years later, after the artist's death, Mr Hughes bought the home for $593,000 from the Warhol estate.

Since then the house has passed through two owners and undergone small-scale renovations. However it still boasts its original ornate wood mouldings, panelling and mantels.
