Sometimes, as anyone who has ever come into contact with Chelsea's manager Jose Mourinho will tell you, sorry seems to be the hardest word.

Sadly Watford's former chairman Elton John was not here to witness Jose Mourinho's public apology for digging out the referee on TV over his failure to award Chelsea a second-half penalty.

It probably helped that they scored anyway after Diego Costa's shot had been charged down and Loic Remy twisted inside the area to score their second. The nation should be grateful for small mercies, though.

Mourinho did not say sorry to those he insulted after claiming that a campaign was being waged against Chelsea when they slipped up at Southampton and were beaten 5-3 at Tottenham, but we cannot expect every thing.

'We had a big penalty in our favour and I was speaking with the referee and I want to apologise for my earlier comments to TV because what he did was great refereeing.

'He was saw that it was a penalty, he was going to give a penalty, but he saw the ball was going to Remy and he waited a couple of seconds.

'He told me that if Remy did not control the ball or if the ball goes over the bar or the ball was lost then he would have given a penalty. So it was good refereeing.

'I was complaining but it was good refereeing by Kevin. So I apologised.' 

Thankfully Remy scored because the fall-out from yet another perceived injustice would have been too much for even the most one-eyed Chelsea fan to stomach after the past few days.

Something has rattled Mourinho's cage of late, but the twinkle in his eye has returned after Chelsea finally broke down Slavisa Jokanovic's team.

He made eight changes to the side beaten at White Hart Lane, giving captain John Terry, Eden Hazard, Cesc Fabregas, Thibaut Courtois and the rest of the gang the day off after their chasing in north London.

Even then it took a double substitution at half time, replacing the woeful Andre Schurrle and the ineffective Oscar, with the energy of Diego Costa and Willian to make the difference.

'Sometimes we don't have good performances and I needed some guarantees of winning,' added Mourinho. 

'To have Willian and Diego was important to us.' 

It certainly was because Mourinho is becoming increasingly irritable in the dug out. For varying reasons Remy, Oscar and even Chelsea doctor Eva Carneiro got it in the neck during a frustrating first half.

Everytime Chelsea ventured forward there was traffic, with five yellow shirts racing across Watford’s defence and four more buzzing around in midfield. Eventually, the lights turned green.

Willian scored the opener in the 58th minute, curling the ball beyond Bond from the edge of the area. It was a quality strike.

Chelsea turned the screw, adding to their lead through Remy and adding a third in the 72nd minute when Kurt Zouma’s deft header beat Bond’s outstretched fingertips.

This was rough on Watford. Jokanovic had a gameplan to suffocate Chelsea’s forward-thinking players and to hope his isolated forward Troy Deeney could do something special in attack.

He had a couple of first half chances, both easily taken by Petr Cech, and faded after the break when Chelsea stepped up the pace.

‘Our plan was to stay in shape and make some counter-attacks,’ admitted Jokanovic. ‘If we scored it could have changed everything.

‘If Deeney had scored it could have changed something, but it is a good experience. We suffered without the ball.

‘It was a nice dream to surprise a team like Chelsea, but in the end we couldn’ t do it. 

‘The FA Cup is over for us and now we must go back to our real life in the next training session.’ 

Soon enough the reality will hit home for Chelsea as they prepare to play six fixtures - a two-legged Capital One Cup semi-final with Liverpool, the FA Cup fourth round and three Barclays Premier League games - in the space of 22 days. 

‘We don’t want to throw away any competition and sometimes we have to make some changes,’ added Mourinho. 

‘To win the game I wanted to make some changes to the system and the dynamic. I want to win the game - I don’t need to be angry.’ As ever with Chelsea’s manager, it’s always hard to talk these things over.
