A sordid tale of teenage betrayal and brutality has authorities struggling to understand how the theft of over $600,000 ended with the tragic death of a 21-year-old woman and with five young men facing charges for a bizarre kidnapping with a near nude escape and the fatal shooting.

An April 20 Miami Herald report tries to shed light on the strange South Florida story, starting with 19-year-old Luis Mir.

After a mutual friend introduced Mir to several other young men in Miami-Dade County, Florida, police say Mir made a proposition that would eventually leave Alain Perea, 19, Roman Villacres, 19, Dexter Marshall, 27, Carlos Morillo, 26, and Joe Manuel Cotte Vazquez, 18 all awaiting trial for Mir’s own violent kidnapping and possibly the death of Perea’s girlfriend Damaris Jaramillo, 21.

Mir’s uncle, it seemed, was allegedly involved in the marijuana growing business and kept a healthy sum of cash in the family home.

The plan: with Mir’s explicit instructions and with him waiting in the getaway car, the other men, led by Perea, would enter Mir’s uncle’s home, push aside Mir’s grandmother and baby sister and lug out a safe full of over $600,000 in cash.

‘He told us all the little information, every detail about his uncle, his family,’ Perea told the Miami Herald. ‘Where it was located and what time to go in, who was inside the house, everything.’

In May 2012, the men allegedly succeeded in their mission. Back with Mir, they would split the mountain of cash.

But that’s when things took a turn. According to Perea and the rest, Mir took far more than his fair share.

And Mir would do little to dissuade Perea and even his own family of that fact.

Though he told Perea that he only took his portion and denied any knowledge of the theft to his family, the unemployed Mir would suddenly start driving a 2010 Infiniti.

His family was immediately suspicious and Perea, too, began to watch Mir closely.

‘I didn’t pay him no mind,’ Mir later said, though he would live to regret it.

Police say that's when Perea and his friends decided to set up Mir to take him down.

On August 8, Mir and his friend Xavier Valdes, 17, left a teen pool party but were lured back by a phone call from Perea’s girlfriend Damaris Jaramillo at Perea’s behest.

Perea and his friends allegedly 
jumped Mir and Valdes and took them back to Jaramillo’s place where they
tied them up and beat them brutally.

Mir claims Perea made no mention of the stolen cash and was instead beating him mercilessly for much smaller trifles.

‘The only thing he said to me “This is because you were flirting with my girlfriend,”’ Mir said.

Shortly thereafter, the kidnappers, who police say were under the influence of drugs, fell asleep.

Meanwhile, Mir’s family ran to the police and Mir himself was able to escape as his kidnappers snoozed.

Shortly thereafter, tragedy struck.

Nearly naked and plodding through the streets of South Miami-Dade County, Mir managed to call police and inform them where he was. They reached Jaramillo’s trailer and burst inside to find her wielding a revolver.

‘The police were forced to utilize deadly force,’ reads the arrest report.

Jaramillo was shot dead by officers on the scene.

The rest of the men were arrested and now, under Florida law, face charges of Jaramillo’s death in addition to the kidnapping charges. They’ve all pleaded not guilty while Mir still faces charges for the May 2012 theft of his uncle's safe.
