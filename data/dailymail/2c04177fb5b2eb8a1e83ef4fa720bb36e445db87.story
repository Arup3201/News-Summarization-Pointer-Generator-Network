Rory McIlroy's decision to play for Ireland at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games has been backed by Team GB’s golf coach.

Englishman Jamie Spence believes it would have been ‘the worst of all worlds’ if McIlroy had felt unable to choose between Team GB and Ireland and had elected to sit on the sidelines when the sport returns to the Olympic fold.

‘Of course I’m disappointed he won’t be playing for us because he’s one of the best players in the world and a clear gold-medal prospect,’ said Spence.

‘But Rory grew up playing for Ireland and he’s made the right call. The most important thing is that it was his decision.’

McIlroy
 chose the happy juxtaposition of the Irish Open starting in Cork and 
the World Cup going on in Rio to finally declare his hand. As a Northern
 Irishman, he had the option to play for either Team GB or Ireland.

‘I’ve
 been thinking about it a lot, all those times I played as an amateur 
for Ireland,’ explained the  25-year-old.

McIlroy was born in Holywood, Northern Ireland, which means he is a UK citizen and so eligible for Team GB.But McIlroy is also an Irish citizen and played amateur golf for Ireland on an all-island team, so he is also eligible to play for that nation at the Olympics.

‘I think for me it’s the right
 decision to play for Ireland and a decision with which I am 100 per 
cent comfortable.’

McIlroy, who split from fiancee Caroline 
Wozniacki last month, added: ‘I’ve had a lot of time on my own the last 
few weeks and I’ve been thinking about it a lot.

'I wouldn’t say I was 
torn about it, more worried about what people would think. But at the 
end of the day you’ve got to do what’s right for yourself.’

Fellow
 Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell, who has also opted to play 
for Ireland, backed McIlroy’s call. ‘I’m hoping to be there alongside 
him,’ he said.
