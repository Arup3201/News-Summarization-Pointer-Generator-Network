The husband of an Ebola-infected aid worker who was airlifted back to the U.S. has been quarantined himself after returning from Liberia.

Nancy's husband David Writebol returned to the US on Sunday night but will have to spend around three weeks in quarantine before he can see his wife

David Writebol and two other missionaries are not showing any symptoms of the deadly virus but will be kept in isolation in Charlotte, North Carolina, for three weeks.

Mr Writebol's wife, Nancy, was airlifted from the African nation after contracting Ebola and remains in a hospital in Atlanta.

The three 
quarantined men will live in motor homes in their mission's RV park 
along with eight others who are in isolation, including six children, until they have gone 
three weeks since their last contact with the infected.

They must stay three feet from each other at all times, and 'can't hug', Bruce Johnson, president of the SIM USA mission, said.

Mr Johnson said Mr Writebol looked glad to be back in the same country as his wife, despite not being able to visit her yet.

'There was good color in his face,' Mr Johnson said.

'He looked great, interacting. He wasn't emotional. There was a sense of relief that was on his face.'

The
 Writebols had been in Liberia since August after being sent there by 
SIM USA and sponsored by their home congregation at Calvary Church in 
Charlotte.

Mrs Writebol, 59, was airlifted back to the US when she started showing symptoms of the virus.

She was evacuated alongside Dr Kent Brantly, who was also infected with Ebola but is on the road to recovery.

Her duties 
at an Ebola clinic included disinfecting staff entering or leaving the 
treatment area, which may explain how she came to be infected.

The
 three men in quarantine will be able to go mountain biking round the 
90-acre park, can eat together as long as they are separated and can 
play games with the children.

Mr Johnson said: '[The men] were amazingly
 vibrant this morning when I was with them, So we're really grateful for
 their health, their spirit, their attitudes.

'They've got great space to walk around, along with our six children that are here who came in earlier, and the other two adults.

'What they can't do is hug. 

'[The quarantine] provides the public the knowledge it is a secure place for their privacy, but it's also a secure place so the public can be reassured of how we're handling this.'

Dr Megan Davies, the state epidemiologist, said the missionaries will check in twice a day, updating health officials with their temperatures, or if they have headaches or abdominal pains.

Ebola has killed nearly 1,000 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria in total.

It is passed by direct contact with the bodily fluids of infected people, so cannot be passed in the air like many other viruses, such as flu.

What is Ebola virus disease?

Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 per cent.The illness affects humans as well as primates, including monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees.

How do people become infected with the virus?

Ebola is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals.

In Africa infection in humans has happened as a result of contact with chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest.

Once a person becomes infected, the virus can spread through contact with a sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen. A person can also become infected if broken skin comes into contact with a victim's soiled clothing, bed linen or used needles.

Men who have recovered from the disease, can still spread the virus to their partner through their semen for seven weeks after recovery.

Who is most at risk?

Those at risk during an outbreak include:

What are the typical signs and symptoms?

Sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. That is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function and internal and external bleeding.

The incubation period is between two and 21 days. A person will become contagious once they start to show symptoms.

When should you seek medical care?

If a person is in an area affected by the outbreak, or has been in contact with a person known or suspected to have Ebola, they should seek medical help immediately.

What is the treatment?

Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. They need intravenous fluids to rehydrate them.

But there is currently no specific treatment for the disease. Some patients will recover with the appropriate care.

Can Ebola be prevented?

Currently there is no licensed vaccine for Ebola. Several are being tested but are not available for clinical use.

Is it safe to travel to affected areas?

The World Health Organisation reviews the public health situation regularly, and recommends travel or trade restrictions if necessary. The risk of infection for travelers is very low since person-to-person transmission results from direct contact with bodily fluids of victims.
