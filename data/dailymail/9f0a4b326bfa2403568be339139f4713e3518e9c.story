For an Upstate New York woman, what started as a night filled with Halloween fun ended in the back of a police car. Twice.

Catherine Butler, 26, from Rochester, made two trips to a police station Saturday on charges of driving while intoxicated in a span of three hours, both times dressed as a zombie.

Ms Butler was returning from a Halloween party at around 2am on Saturday when she was pulled over by police on Buffalo Road in Gates for allegedly driving without headlights.

Scary behavior: Catherine Butler, 26, from Rochester, New York, pictured in her booking photo in a zombie makeup, was arrested twice on DWI charges in a span of three hours after leaving a Halloween party

Bloody good time: Prior to her arrest, Butler had attended the Zombie Prom party at BLU Bar and Grill 

A Breathalyzer test showed that her blood alcohol level at the time was .11 per cent, according to police, which is above the state legal limit of .08, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reported. 

She was hauled off to the local police station and photographed for a mugshot, which shows the teary-eyed blonde sporting spooky zombie makeup, complete with smears of fake blood on her face and neck.

A friend later picked up Butler and drove her home.

But less than three hours later, the Halloween reveler was stopped a second time by a different officer after she was allegedly spotted swerving in and out of her lane on the same street. 

Sequel: Butler, seen here wearing the same outfit she had on during her arrest, was released to a friend the first time around, but she was pulled over again just three hours later 

Police say the 26-year-old was still wearing the same costume she had donned Friday night to attend the Zombie Prom party at BLU Bar and Grill in Gates. 

Dark past: Butler had been arrested twice before on DWI charges, including in 2011 (pictured) 

Although Butler had somewhat sobered up since her first arrest, police say her blood alcohol level still slightly surpassed the legal limit, earning her a second DWI charge.

Ms Butler had had other run-ins with the law in the past.

She was arrested on DWI charges in 2006 and 2011, but those counts had been reduced to impaired driving.

On Saturday morning, she was driving with a valid license.  

'That's four driving while intoxicated arrests that she's been involved in. I don't know what it's going to take to get people to stop driving under the influence,' Gates Police Chief James VanBrederode told Time Warner Cable News.

Butler is now facing two counts of DWI, along with fines for driving without headlights and failure to maintain lane. 

She is due back in court November 18.
