Enzalutamide extends survival time for men with untreatable prostate cancer (file picture)

A new drug for prostate cancer patients who have run out of treatment options has been licensed for use in the UK.

Enzalutamide (Xtandi) extends survival time and improves the quality of life.

It is now available in England via the Cancer Drugs Fund to men whose disease has become resistant to first-line hormonal treatments and has not responded well to chemotherapy.

One in eight men in the UK is affected by the cancer that develops in the walnut-sized gland underneath the male bladder. About 40,000 new cases are diagnosed every year, and it is the second most common cause of cancer death in men.

Early-stage prostate cancer can be treated but it is incurable if the disease spreads. Up to 30 per cent of men are not diagnosed until the disease has reached this stage, and 72 per cent of these will die within  five years.

A multinational trial involving 1,199 men with advanced cancer showed that Enzalutamide improved overall survival by an average of 4.8 months compared to a placebo.

Prostate cancer is fuelled by the 
male hormone testosterone. Enzalutamide works by targeting the male 
hormone receptors in the cancer cells, so blocking the effects of 
testosterone.

Heather 
Payne, Consultant in Clinical Oncology at University College Hospital, 
London, says: ‘Enzalutamide allows us to offer men another option which 
will extend their lifespan, improve their pain and allow them to 
maintain a good quality of life for longer.’

Although
Enzalutamide is currently licensed for use only when other treatments 
have stopped working, it is also being trialled for use in earlier 
stages of the disease.

She
adds: ‘It’s not a cure but  it slows down the progression of the 
disease. This drug gives huge hope to men with  prostate cancer.’

Enzalutamide,
which is taken in capsules once daily, is now awaiting approval by the
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.
