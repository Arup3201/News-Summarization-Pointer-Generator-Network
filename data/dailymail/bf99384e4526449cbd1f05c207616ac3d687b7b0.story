A Delaware man was arrested Tuesday after throwing semen at a 20-year-old woman he told police he thought was ‘hot.’Frank Short Jr., 22, was charged with a litany of offenses after being arrested for the depraved act in a New Castle, DE, Wal-Mart, according to a police report obtained by Mail Online.Among the charges are lewdness, harassment and offensive touching with bodily fluids, said the report.

Depraved: Frank Short Jr., 22, threw semen on a 20-year-old woman standing in the aisle of the New Castle, DE, Wal-Mart

The incident occurred while the woman was in a Wal-Mart aisle texting and Short walked past her, saying ‘excuse me,’ said the report. The woman soon felt ‘something wet on her buttocks, thigh and leg.’Though she initially thought the pervert spit on her, the woman soon realized it was ‘a glob of semen on her leg, just below her knee,’ the report said.

At first the degenerate denied his depravity, saying he ‘sneezed into his hands, then shook his hands off’ onto the poor woman’s leg. He soon admitted to spitting on the lady before finally copping to the whole thing after calling the woman ‘hot.’

Short also admitted to considering himself a 'loner' who 'gets a thrill out of such an act,' the report said.

The report concluded Short took ‘a substance into his hand, believed to be his own semen, and did place this substance upon the body of [the victim] because he was sexually attracted to her.’He was booked and tossed into a local jail before being released later in the day on bond.
