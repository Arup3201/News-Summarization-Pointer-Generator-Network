Nabbed: Michael Brewster, 54, of Pensacola, Fla. was arrested on Thursday after pulled over for running a stop sign in Oklahoma in what they'd discovered was a stolen SUV

The suspected 'bucket list bandit' who robbed at least 10 banks during a near three month road trip across the U.S. was arrested after running a stop sign in Oklahoma.

Police in Roland said Michael Eugene Brewster, 54, who got his name by telling bank tellers he only had four months to live, was nabbed after his vehicle was found reported stolen in Florida while re-marked with Utah license plates.

As ABC reports Brewster was evicted from his Pensacola apartment in Florida on June 14, seven days before appearing in Colorado where he hit his first bank.

From there he went on an 85-day trip around the country while only until now, according to at least one crime expert speaking to ABC, amazingly getting away with his crimes.

'The fact that this guy committed not oneâ€¦but a total of 10 bank robberies is a little startling,' said law enforcement expert and crime analyst Rod Wheeler. 'And the fact that he got away with these crimes is even more startling.'

Brewster's arrest on Thursday came three days after his most recent heist at a Huntington National Bank in Erie Pennsylvania bank where he was recognized by his blue polo shirt, grim prognosis, and warning of being armed.

Following that robbery a massive search went out for the man, plastering his face on billboards, TV stations, posters and the internet.

He was connected to the robberies after a confidential informant gave the FBI Brewster's name and birth date presumably after spotting him on a wanted poster the FBI had released.

'On September 12, 2012, a Contributor of Information (COI) telephonically contacted the FBI-Erie office and identified Michael Eugene Brewster as the 'Bucket List Bandit,'' Erie FBI Special Agent Kirk R. Brace said.

According to the Erie Times News, just days earlier on September 10 he 
approached a female teller and handed her a piece of paper containing 
instructions in which he demanded $5,000 in a bag, that he had a gun but
 did not want to use it, that she had a minute to comply.

In a hurry: Brewster was arrested in Oklahoma on Thursday after driving this stolen SUV from Florida through a stop sign

Routine work: Surveillance photos provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigations show the serial bank robber in the same blue polo from left on June 21, June 27 and July 6, 2012

He also advised her not to provide bait bills or set off any alarms.

The
 teller gave Brewster about $4,080 and after putting money in the black 
binder he was holding, he told her that he had cancer and did not care 
what happens, and to give him a minute. He fled the bank on foot heading
 east.

After arresting the man, authorities 
then reviewed surveillance video and found an 'obvious likeness' to 
Brewster during robberies in Missouri, Colorado, Arizona, Idaho, Utah, 
North Carolina, Tennessee and Illinois.

The black Chevy Captiva, which the man is accused of borrowing from a woman on June 11 and not returning it, is similar to the vehicles seen by witnesses at several of the 'Bucket List Bandit' bank heists.

Tipster: The FBI launched a massive hunt for the man who claimed to have just months to live and 'didn't care' leading to a tipster's aid in identifying him

Scene: The last bank to be robbed, making at least 10 by the same bandit, was this Huntington branch bank in Erie, Pennsylvania on Monday

Before he held up the Erie bank, Brewster's most recent robberies have been in St Louis and Columbia, Missouri.

Prior to that he has struck in Colorado, Arizona, Idaho, Utah, North Carolina, Tennessee and Illinois.

The robber usually wears the same blue polo shirt and jeans for his robberies. He also has a gray mustache and wears glasses.

The bandit typically walks into a bank alone and hands the teller a demand note. It isn't clear whether he needed the 
money for medical care or for spending during his 
final few months.

'It's not uncommon for a robber to 
just want to get in and get out,' said Rebecca Wu, a spokeswoman from 
the FBI St Louis division, in an interview with Fox News.

'They generally want to draw as little attention to themselves as possible.'

No one was hurt in any of the robberies and officials have not revealed how much money has been stolen. In some of the crimes the robber has implied that he has a weapon, but has never shown one.

The FBI was planning to use digital billboards in the eight states where the bandit struck to display images of the man to help them track him down.
