As the American Red Cross continues to draw heat for not adequately meeting the needs brought on by Hurricane Sandy, the organization is responding that its relief efforts have been ‘near flawless.’

The organization, which calls itself ‘the world's largest humanitarian network,’ took that stance in an interview with an NBC reporter on Sunday.

‘Given the magnitude of this storm, the American Red Cross is very proud of its response - our largest U.S. relief effort in more than five years,’ Laura Howe, a Red Cross spokeswoman told the Daily Mail in an email exchange.

The Red Cross recently got caught up in a media storm that has shaken its public image over the past two weeks.

The New York Times on November 2 ran a story under the headline: ‘Anger Grows at Response by Red Cross’

The Associated Press on November 4 ran a story under the headline: ‘Red Cross Carries on After Drawing Criticism — Again — for Its Response to a Major Disaster’

Thirteen days have passed since Hurricane Sandy ravaged the East Coast, killing at least 120 people and causing an estimated $50 billion in damage from South Carolina to Maine.

The storm destroyed homes around New York City and along the New Jersey Shore, cut off power for more than 8 million people and delivered a major blow to public transportation systems.

Several hundred thousand people in New York and New Jersey are still without electricity, including an estimated 170,000 on Long Island.

Volunteers, public officials and those who have been impacted by the storm are directing some of their anger at the Red Cross.

'I saw them up at FEMA (a claim center 
outside Breezy Point),’ a 79-year-old storm victim in Queens told an NBC
reporter. ‘What would they do? Were they offering anything? No. I need 
services, I don’t need them to give me coffee.’

James Molinaro, Staten Island’s borough president, took a recent opportunity to chastise the organization, calling its ‘absence from the relief effort’ an ‘absolute disgrace.’

Molinaro told a New York Times reporter that he had visited a shelter after the storm and witnessed people arriving barefoot.

‘They were in desperate need,’ he said. ‘Their housing was destroyed. They were crying. Where was the Red Cross? Isn’t that their function?’

The Red Cross and its president, Gail McGovern, are now juggling relief efforts with efforts to keep criticism at bay. The organization publicly apologized last Sunday for not responding sooner to get food, water 
and other supplies to storm victims in New York and New Jersey.

‘No disaster response is perfect, and we understand the frustration people feel,’ Howe told the Daily Mail. ‘But with nearly 6,000 volunteers delivering millions of meals and hundreds of thousands of supplies, we are serving more neighborhoods and more people every day.’
