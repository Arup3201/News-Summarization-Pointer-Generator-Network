A local TV station in Chicago accidentally showed a porn site during a news segment about a new app.

WGN-TV was doing a report on an app that helps juveniles expunge their criminal records

To show the many different ways users can access the site, they filmed a production staffer looking up the app on their iPhone.Â

Whoops: WGN was doing a segment on a new app, using a production staffers iPhone. Unfortunately, the phone's owner had recently visited a porn website and that appeared in the search history on air

But while typing the address into the search bar, the iPhone owner's search history popped up - revealing an embarrassing query for Pornhub.com.

A user on Reddit pointed the snafu out and the station quickly took down the video from their website.

'Chicago needs a fresh start on their browser history...' the user wrote.

Mediaite was quick enough to record the video and post it on their own site, so the on-air slip-up can be preserved for years to come.

There's an app for that: The news broadcast was about a new app that helps juveniles in Illinois expunge their criminal records

News stations often use phones belonging to their own employees to use as props in news segments.

It's likely that whoever lent their phone didn't know how to clear their search history, which is easier to do on a computer than on a phone.

For the iPhone used in the segment, the owner could have cleared the search history by clicking 'Settings', going into the Safari app and clicking 'Clear History'.
