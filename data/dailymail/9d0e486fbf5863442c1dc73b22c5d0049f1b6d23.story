It was one of Bernard Matthews's dearest wishes.

After his death, the millionaire turkey tycoon wanted his French mistress of 23 years to carry on living in the luxury Mediterranean villa they had shared.

He made three wills, and in a pleading letter begged his estranged wife and children to let Odile Marteyn keep his £12million mansion near Saint Tropez.

But it has now emerged in a High Court
case that his three adopted children – who were left nothing in his 
will – have defied this wish and are claiming their share of the villa.

Despite the three wills, Mr Matthews 
knew that he was powerless against French inheritance laws, which 
decreed that 75 per cent of his property would go to his family.

So in 2006, four years before he died 
aged 80, he wrote a letter addressed to Joyce, at that time his wife of 
54 years, and 'all members of my family'.

In it, he described how 'Odile has 
supported me unfailingly for years', and reminded his children that he 
had already been generous to them and long provided financial support.

Miss Marteyn, now 62, was at Mr 
Matthews's bedside when he died, along with his wife. Her existence was a
secret until last year when Mr Matthews's will was published, revealing
he had left her £1million.

It also revealed that he had left all 
but one per cent of his 39 per cent holding – believed to be worth 
£30million – to Frederick, his son from a five-year affair with a Dutch 
aristocrat.

The 30-year-old internet entrepreneur is not claiming his share of the French villa.

In the letter, Mr Matthews wrote: 'The
purpose of this letter is to explain to you all ... my thinking in 
relation to my absolute gift of my French villa to Odile.

'Odile has supported me unfailingly for many years and particularly so during my recent illnesses.

'Without such support, I might not have been able to continue directing our family company for our mutual benefit …

'In reaching my decision I have taken 
into account the fact that each of you is very well housed with at least
one property each and that, directly or indirectly, I have provided 
financially for each of you over a very long period of years.

'I wish the French villa to continue 
to be occupied and enjoyed and consider Odile would be the best person 
to take on this responsibility'.

'The purpose of this letter is to explain to you all...my thinking in relation to my absolute gift of my French village to Odile.

'Odile has supported me unfailingly for many years and particularly so during my recent illnesses.

'Without such support, I might not have been able to continue directing our family company for our mutual benefit.

'In reaching my decision I have taken into account the fact that each of you is very well housed with at least one property each and that, directly or indirectly, I have provided financially for each of you over a very long period of years.

'I wish the French villa to continue to be occupied and enjoyed and consider Odile would be the best person to take on this responsibility.'

In one of his wills – two French and 
one English – Mr Matthews, whose property outside of France was worth 
around £40million, bequeathed the villa to his 62-year-old mistress 
outright.

But a ruling at the High Court 
yesterday revealed that his three adopted children, Kathleen, Jason and
Victoria, have not adhered to their late father's request and instead 
have insisted on their right to their stake in the villa – 56.25 per 
cent excluding Frederick's share.

This leaves Miss Marteyn with 43.75 
per cent, but Judge Nicholas Strauss QC said she 'accepts that there is 
nothing she can do about this'.

The case came to the High Court 
because the children had argued that the £2million inheritance tax they 
are liable to pay on their share of the villa should  be paid out of 
their late father's English estate.

However, rejecting their arguments, 
Judge Strauss said Mr Matthews had clearly wished Miss Marteyn to 
inherit the entire villa and to have her French inheritance tax bill 
paid from his estate.

'He did not want his adopted children to have any part of the property.

He concluded: 'For this reason, I hold
that the adopted children have no right under the English will to have 
their tax liability discharged, or to be reimbursed if they have paid 
it.'

Despite his extramarital affairs, Mr 
Matthews, who once described his private life as 'complicated', never 
divorced his childhood sweetheart Joyce, 83, whom he married in 1952.

A Matthews family spokesman said they did not wish to comment.
