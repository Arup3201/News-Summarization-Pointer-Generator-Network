One of the stand out events of this year's Oscars ceremony was that ubiquitous selfie taken by Bradley Cooper on Ellen DeGeneres’ phone.

The problem that many people highlighted was the fact that Cooper's arms weren’t quite long enough to fit everyone in - but now there’s a solution, dubbed the 'selfie stick.'

A number of companies are now selling 'arm extenders' that not only hold the camera, but are also used to take the shot and even focus the image.

Selfie sticks, or monpods, pictured, work by holding the camera in landscape mode, with the screen facing the photographer. Buttons on the handle of the stick are used to control the device. Some monopods manually press the shutter button on the side of phone using an arm, or similar. Others connect remotely via Bluetooth

Monpods work by holding the camera in landscape mode, with the screen facing the photographer, and using the front-facing camera.

Buttons on the handle of the stick are used to control the device. 

Depending
 on the model, some monopods will manually press the shutter button on 
the side of phone using an arm, or similar.

Others connect 
remotely via Bluetooth and take the photo using software controls.

The trend for cameras on sticks, also known as monopods, isn’t new and a number of sticks are already available for digital cameras from companies including Opteka and XShot.

But monopods designed especially for 
smartphones, however, were unveiled at this year’s Mobile World 
Congress, including a Samsung version from Chinese firm Winners’ Sun 
Plastic Electronics.

It is a trend that's especially popular in Asia, including Indonesia.

Soulaya Lestary, 20, from Indonesia, told The Huffington Post: 'We use social media all the time and because we’re shy to ask someone, [to] take picture of us,’ it’s easier to do it ourselves.'

Meanwhile, a number of existing monopods can be used with iPhones, from companies including Interfit, grips pictured. Prices range from £15 ($24) up to £30 ($50) depending on the make and model

Models from Gala, pictured, sell for between £10 ($18) and £13 ($22) in the Philippines

On the Winners’ Sun Plastic Electronics version there is additionally a timer delay button and a focus button.

The selfie stick on display at Mobile World Congress didn’t have a release date or a price.

Models from Gala sell for between £10 ($18) and £13 ($22) in the Philippines, and on online, while existing monopods range in price from £15 ($24) up to £30 ($50) depending on the make and model.
