Wedding dress re-sale site PreOwnedWeddingDresses.com has released a Wedding Dress Value Calculator for former brides who want to figure out how much their used dress is worth.

The calculator estimates a gown's worth based on the label, date purchased, price paid and other characteristics like whether or not the dress was cleaned.

'The calculator is a starting price 
that we consider to be "fair value" for a seller's gown given all of the
factors that we know influence a sale price, site creator Josie Daga 
tells MailOnline.

Celebrity fans: Beyonce's crystal-encrusted Barraci wedding dress is for sale for $30,000 on PreOwnedWeddingDresses.com. The steep figure is a relative bargain - the original price tag was $85,000

She typically recommends that a used gown be priced at
50per cent of its retail value - if it is less than two years old, has 
been cleaned and is in great condition.

Designers like Vera Wang and Monique Lhuillier can fetch slightly more than 50per cent, while custom work can be harder to recoup in a sell.

Styles worn by celebrities are especially coveted though.

'Chelsea Clinton's, Vera Wang Diana, Khloe Kardashian's Vera Wang Ethel and 
Hilary Duffs Vera Wang Gemma are still quite popular,' Ms Daga says.

And some stars even use the site to buy and sell their gowns. Kim Zolciak famously 
paid $58,000 for her Baracci gown on the site, and currently for sale is Beyonce's Baracchi crystal-encrusted gown from the 'Best Thing I Never Had' video (original price, $85,000; selling for $30,000)

The average selling time is 70 days, though some dresses sell within 24 hours.

And while some brides still sell because of cancelled weddings, Daga says there is a growing trend to pass the dress on partly because the bride wants someone else to experience the same joy.

But does it work? I tried the calculator on myself - and a few other brides - to find out. 

Blowing the budget: Catherine Townsend re-sold her $17,900 Vera Wang Eliza Deluxe gown for $7,500

'Any future daughter of mine will think my Vera Wang is a yellowing meringue monstrosity!'

THE BRIDE: Catherine Townsend

THE WEDDING: September 21, 2012 at the Hotel Bel Air in Los Angeles, California

THE DRESS: Vera Wang Eliza Deluxe

ORIGINAL PRICE: $15,900

CALCULATED VALUE: $9,306

SOLD FOR: $7,500

CATHERINE SAYS: People have commented that it's ridiculous to put something on my body that costs more than a used car, and I agree. I wanted a bottle of tequila and City Hall, but my husband was dead-set on a larger wedding for friends and family and generously offered to foot the bill.

My Vera Wang Eliza Deluxe was customized with sweetheart neckline, a seven-foot cathedral train and beadwork. The retail price was $25,000, but I paid $15,900 and cut a deal with the seamstress to do the customization separately for a total of $17,900.

I loved wearing my dress, but was equally happy to box it up afterwards. I know that in rare cases women can pass their dresses down, but I thought it far more likely that any future daughter of mine would think it looked like a yellowing meringue monstrosity - and I wanted to get some of the money back!

I didn't have the calculator, but with the price point and custom work I knew that I was catering to a very specific buyer.

Luckily I found her - the woman who bought the dress has now become a friend, and I'm actually going to her wedding in Italy. So the cathedral train will actually get to see the inside of a cathedral!

Buyer's remorse: Nahrein Emerson couldn't return her Jenny Packham dress (as seen on the catwalk)

'My Twenties-style Jenny Packham gown was a mistake I couldn't return'

THE BRIDE: Nahrein Emerson

THE WEDDING: October 20, 2012 at Holy Apostolic Assyrian Catholic 
Church of the East in the Sunset in San Francisco, California

THE DRESS: Jenny Packham's Eden dress

ORIGINAL PRICE: $5,000

CALCULATED VALUE: $4,500

SOLD FOR: $3,000

NAHREIN SAYS: 'It was a mistake dress.

'I was under pressure to pick one and I 
went to a number of bridal shops and this was the first dress that 
didn’t look like a meringue.

'I had my doubts from the moment I went home
and I called them the next day to say I wanted to change it from white 
to cream and they said I should wear white – they didn’t let me change. 
Then I found my dream dress.

'When I found out I couldn’t cancel I 
started looking for ways to sell it.

'I didn't know about the price calculator, I just 
figured that I would knock $1,000 off and someone would be thrilled.'

Mrs Emerson sold the dress to a 'sweet' bride planning a Great Gatsby/flapper
theme and says that she will attend her wedding next year.

Something old: Julie Buratti Buthman sold her Elizabeth Fillmore dress for an impressive $1,400 (posed by model)

'I was never going to wear the dress again'

THE BRIDE: Julie Buratti Buthman

THE WEDDING: June 12, 2012 at the Devon Boathouse in Oklahoma City

THE DRESS: The Elizabeth Filmore Evie dress

ORIGINAL PRICE: $2,000

CALCULATED VALUE: $900

SOLD FOR: $1,400

JULIE SAYS: 'I
decided to sell my wedding dress because I knew that I was never going
to wear it again and it would just sit in a closet somewhere. By 
selling the dress, someone else could enjoy the dress as much as I did.

'I
don't know any details about the [buyer's] wedding, but I do know that
she is a fairly young bride just graduating college this year.'

'It was expensive, so getting some of the money back makes sense'

THE BRIDE: Amanda Bassin

THE WEDDING: January 12, 2013

THE DRESS: Sottero & Midgley's Chrystelle gown

ORIGINAL PRICE: $1,700

CALCULATED VALUE: $765

SOLD FOR: $895

Financial incentive: Amanda Bassin spent $1,700 on her Sottero and Midgley gown, so was keen to get some of that money back (posed by model)

AMANDA SAYS: 'Not only is it beautiful and magical and I would love for someone to wear it again, practically, it's expensive, so getting some of the money back makes sense.

'Also I don't believe that the reason people keep their gowns, 20 years down the road my unborn daughter would wear it, makes any sense at all fashion wise.'

Mrs Bassin sold the dress to a bride who was the same size and, since designer wedding gowns normally have to be ordered six months in advance, was under time pressure.

Selling one's bridal gown is a growing trend, inspired both by financial incentive and the influence of celebrities like Beyonce, whose dress is currently listed on the site
