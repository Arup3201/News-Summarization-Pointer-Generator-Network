Her daughter makes millions every year walking the catwalk and fronting campaigns for the world's most esteemed designers but the mother of supermodel Natalia Vodianova still makes a living selling pies on the streets of Russia. 

Natalia, 33, used to join her mother as a market trader in Nizhny Novgorod before being discovered at the age of 17 and whisked off to a life of luxury at the forefront of fashion.

Since then, she has become one of the world's most in-demand supermodels working with Calvin Klein, Stella McCartney and Louis Vuitton and many others.

Rags to riches: Natalia Vodianova has made millions as a supermodel after growing up in poverty

Still earning her own living: Natalia's mother Larissa says she won't give up work

But despite her daughter's wealth and success, 52-year-old Larissa is insistent that she will continue to make her own living.  

She said: 'I and my other daughter (Natalia's sister) want to show others that we can achieve something in life by ourselves. Sixteen-years-ago Natalia was selling bananas in the market to help make ends meet. It's nothing to be ashamed of.'

Larissa, who also had a daughter with cerebral palsy, said Natalia has been 'incredibly supportive' of the family and understands her mother's to desire to keep working.

Natalia told You Magazine: 'My mother is such an inspiration to me: she lived her life by following her heart, rather than what she was being told was "the right thing to do".'

Supportive: Natalia used to join her mother selling fruit before becoming a supermodel and understands why she wants to keep her job going

Larissa taught Natalia to have a strong work ethic from a young age. As the family were struggling to get by, Natalia had to leave school to start earning money by selling fruit before she found fame as a model.

Her rags to riches tale was complete when in 2001, she married English aristocrat, Justin Portman, the heir to 110 acres of prime central London property and the half-brother of the 10th Viscount Portman. They had three children together but separated in 2011.

Since then, Natalia has met another wealthy suitor, Antoine Arnault, 36, the CEO of luxury men's footwear brand Berluti, and the son of LVMH founder Bernard Arnault.

They had a son, Maxim, together in May. 

While Natalia now lives a privileged life, she said she has never forgotten her roots.

She said of her past: 'It was a tough but not a bleak life. I remember once finding a rouble on the street – at a time when the average salary was perhaps 25 roubles a month; I grabbed it with a feeling of euphoria, ran back to my mother and was allowed to go shopping for food with it. It was a wonderful feeling to be able to do that for my family. From very early on, I had a strong sense of responsibility.'

She added that she believes growing up in poverty set her on the path to success.

'I live a very different life now, with incredible privileges, but looking back I realise that growing up in Russia gave me tools that other people don’t necessarily have – such as the will to push that bit further, to make things happen, to succeed. I try to use these now to help other people,' she explained.

In 2004, Natalia founded the Naked Heart Foundation to help children in need in Russia. The charity aims to 'ensure that every child has a loving family, and a safe and stimulating place to play'.

The supermodel holds a number of fundraising events every year and has run half marathons to raise money for the charity.
