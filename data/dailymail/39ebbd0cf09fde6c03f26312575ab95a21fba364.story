Pet lovers from around the world have donated more than £1million to Manchester Dogs Home after a horrific blaze killed 53 animals on Thursday night.

It emerged yesterday that the dogs which died had been ready to be rehomed with families after being rehabilitated at the centre.

Police spent the day questioning a  15-year-old arrested on suspicion of arson.

Wellwishers took food, bedding and 
toys to the home’s sister branch in Warrington which was caring for 150 
dogs saved from the blaze by staff, neighbours and firemen.

Money poured in to the home’s 
JustGiving page from as far afield as Australia, the US and Canada, as 
thousands of social media users posted ‘dog selfies’ to promote the 
cause.

Police confirmed that 53 dogs had died
 in the blaze, which home manager Lisa Graham said was concentrated in 
kennels dedicated to dogs which were ready for adoption. All but two of 
those dogs died. She said: ‘The dogs in there were dogs that were 
relying on us to find them homes.’

All the staff were upset, she added, particularly those who worked in the kennels.

‘It has been hard for everyone but the
 kennel staff are suffering the most,’ she said. ‘They have been caring 
for them, and feeding them and rehabilitating them.’

It took 30 firemen just over an hour to bring the blaze under control.

Colin Ballance, who has worked at the 
centre for 25 years, risked his life to save a crossbreed dog and a 
Staffordshire cross from the burning adoption kennel.

He said: ‘I just ran straight towards 
where the fire was, pulled the doors open, and all the roof and timbers 
and everything else was burning away.

‘I couldn’t let them all out, that was
 a risk to them and a risk to everybody, so I grabbed the first two. By 
the time I got them out and took them to an outside pen further away, I 
turned back to go back and you couldn’t even see in front of you – the 
smoke was horrendous, it was just choking.

‘I didn’t sleep last night because I 
was just thinking about all the dogs. It was the fact that when we ran 
in they were all there but there was nothing we could do. There were 
bits falling from the ceiling. All you could hear was dogs barking. It 
was just a nightmare.’

Firefighters have described how they will never forget the sound of the distressed animals as they tried to get through the wall of smoke in the home

Neighbours Jason Dyer, 41, his son 
Daniel and nephew Dean Rostock, both 25, were hailed as heroes for 
rescuing between 30 and 40 dogs from kennels next to the burning 
building. Mr Dyer said: ‘We ran over instantly, jumped over the fences 
and starting kicking the cages open, pulling the dogs out two at a time.

‘My son ran to reception to grab all 
the leads so we could use them to tie the dogs up – we tied them to the 
fence in the car park. The ceiling was collapsing in and windows were 
popping left, right and centre.’

His son said: ‘The dogs were coughing 
and vomiting from the smoke. Nothing deserves to die like that, just at 
the flick of a finger.’

The Manchester and District Home for Lost Dogs was founded in 1892 by businessmen concerned about stray dogs roaming the city, then the heart of the Industrial Revolution.

It has re-homed more than one million dogs in 120 years.

The city grew around the centre and it is now surrounded by homes, describing itself as an 'inner-city' centre, and has a sister re-homing site near Warrington, Cheshire.

The charity says it takes in more than 7,000 dogs every year, many of which are never reclaimed by their owners and require emotional and physical support after abuse or neglect.

Dogs are then usually made available for adoption, with more than 250 often awaiting a home at any one time.

Poignant: Volunteers waited with dog leads to help move the saved animals to other rescue centres

Popular: Police provided contact numbers for people who wanted to help as donations soared over £100,000

But there was joy for one dog owner last night who feared her pet had perished.

Leo, a two-year-old bichon frise, had 
been taken to the centre by a dog warden after escaping from the home of
 owner Dawn Bradbury, 29.

She rushed to the centre after hearing
 about the fire and was alarmed when she could not find him. But then a 
friend told her she had seen Leo on TV coverage of the blaze and the 
pair were reunited at the Warrington centre.

The manager of a local branch of builders merchant Jewson has offered to donate materials to help rebuild the home.

Last night it was claimed the teenage 
boy who has been arrested had recently been attacked by a dog. It is 
believed police are temporarily rehousing his family for their safety.
