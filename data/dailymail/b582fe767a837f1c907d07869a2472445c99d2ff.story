Football is not always as glamourous as some might imagine, as the story of the first time I signed Marouane Fellaini perhaps illustrates.

The serious negotiating began in smart enough surroundings; the Les Ambassadeurs Club in Mayfair. But it wasn’t long before the Everton club secretary and I were jumping on a four-seater prop plane and making a crazy dash to Brussels with only a few hours left of transfer deadline day. And that was only the beginning of our problems.

Our European scouts had been aware of Marouane for some time. He was doing well in what was a very good Standard Liege team. They had some decent players. Steven Defour and Axel Witsel in a midfield three with Marouane. Dante, a fine Brazilian centre half now at Bayern Munich. And a good striker in Dieumerci Mbokani. I liked the way they played.

This was August 2008, and Liverpool were drawn against them in the qualification round of the Champions League. So I went along to Anfield to watch, and then flew out to Belgium that weekend to see Marouane in action again. He was excellent. Perfect for us at Everton.

But not until transfer deadline day did we get to sit down with Standard Liege. It was Bill Kenwright and myself, a couple of agents and these guys from Belgium. Eventually Dave Harrison, our secretary, joined us as well.

We went in there at around 2pm wanting to spend no more than £11million or £12m. But hours went by and we were getting nowhere, and the price was slowly creeping up. Bill kept having to check if we were still doing the right thing; if as a club run very prudently we could actually afford it. By 7pm we were still at a stalemate, but by 9.30pm we had a deal - £15m.

I’m always very careful when I’m spending the club’s money. I treat it like it’s my own and I always try to sign players for what I feel is the right price. We had spent decent money on Yakubu the year before but most of our signings — players like Phil Jagielka, Joleon Lescott, Mikel Arteta and Leighton Baines — came for fees closer to three, four or five million. A year later we signed Seamus Coleman for 60 grand from Sligo Rovers.

Marouane’s fee took Everton out of their comfort zone. It was big money for the club. But I knew he was what we needed. I wanted him. And I was so determined to get him I made damn sure we signed him that night by going to Brussels myself. It was an insane race against time. First in the car from Mayfair to Luton Airport, then this bumpy, terrifying ride across the English Channel in this tiny aircraft and finally the hunt not only to find Marouane but a hotel fax machine that actually worked.

When we arrived at a hotel that still seemed to be under construction it was chaos. We couldn’t find the lad. And when we eventually did — he was with his dad and an agent — we discovered the fax machine in the hotel business centre didn’t work. I remember Dave screaming down the phone to the FA, trying to explain that the bloody thing was broken. It was a complete car crash.

We were rescued by someone in the hotel who then said there was a machine in one of the executive rooms that worked, and with minutes to spare the paperwork was faxed through and Marouane was ours.

He arrived at Everton and, of course, the first thing everyone clocked was the hair. I’ve always been quite strict when it comes to the appearance of my players. I don’t want to see earrings in training, things like that. With Marouane’s hair, I actually wondered if it might take a bit of the pace off the ball when he went up for a header. But I soon realised it was part of his personality. Part of who he is.

Moyes signed Fellaini, here after a match against Liverpool in 2012, from Standard Liege to Everton in 2008 - it was a fee that took the club out of their comfort zone but, Moyes writes, 'I knew he was what we needed'

The qualities that made Moyes sign Fellaini to Everton when the same reasons he brought him to Manchester United for £27.5m on a five-year contract - the midfielder was Moyes only signing of the summer window

When we signed him he was still very young and very slightly built. But he worked incredibly hard to develop his upper body and gain the strength you need in the Premier League. In fact, he worked hard at all aspects of his game, and he became a real asset for us. He could score goals. He has great energy. He’s a terrific runner and, while he’s not the quickest player in the Premier League, he will cover as much ground as anyone.

Technically he’s very good. He has fantastic chest control, for instance. And he’s very professional; hard working with a great attitude. He will do anything you ask and all you’ll ever hear from him is a ‘thank you, coach’ at the end of a training session. He’s a very quiet lad. If anything a little shy.

It was all these qualities that convinced me to bring him to Manchester United, and he was very excited to come. It was a big move for him.

I remember his father, a former professional player and a huge influence on Marouane, being in tears at Carrington on the day we signed him. He was so proud his son was joining this great football club.

Just like the first time I signed him, the deal was done right on deadline. But, of course, he wasn’t meant to be our only signing at United that summer. He was brought in to compliment the squad and the other players we were hoping to bring in; to do a certain job in certain games.

Unfortunately for Marouane, he was the only player we brought in and because of that he was seen as the big signing. It meant he was under more pressure than he perhaps should have been. And when the season didn’t start the way we all wanted it to, he came under a great deal of scrutiny, even if most of the attention was on me.

I felt it was unfair that he was having to carry that extra pressure and expectation, and deal with extra criticism, simply because David Moyes had signed him. 

I think he’d be the first to admit he maybe didn’t always play as well as he could have done when he got the chance. But it was a big change for him, even if he did have previous Premier League experience, and he had come into a team that wasn’t playing with as much confidence as we would have liked. I think that affected him as well.

It’s also true that players can take time to settle at a new club. I remember people telling me it took Patrice Evra and Nemanja Vidic a while. Players who became great players for United.

Marouane should have been given time too, because he’s now proving what I always believed; that he can be an important player for United.

I’ve watched him in the last two games and he has been first class. He’s had an influence on the games, which is what you look to your bigger players to do. And I think he’s played an important part in helping United gain some momentum going into today’s Manchester derby.

There were times last season, when things were tough, when we spoke. But I told him then that he would become a top United player if he continued to work hard.

It was hard when I left, because we had a great relationship and I think he was upset. I did feel bad, responsible even. I’d convinced him to come across in the belief that was I going to be there for a long time, and now suddenly I was leaving. But in football everyone realises these things can happen, and Marouane knows his job is to deliver for United.

He can perform several jobs in a team but I think it helps him to have someone like Daley Blind sitting there in that more defensive midfield role. At Standard Liege he had Defour or Witsel sitting deeper and allowing him to get further forward, and at Everton he had players like Phil Neville.

At United last season we lacked that kind of midfielder, and while Marouane has the physical ability to cover the ground he’s definitely more effective in a game if he’s accompanied by a defensive midfield player.

So I’m delighted he’s settled down now and he’s beginning to be appreciated for what he is; a damn fine footballer who was definitely worth the effort as well as the money.

Marouane Fellaini suffered the harshest criticism as Manchester United’s form crumbled last season. But, after a steady World Cup in Brazil and an injury-hit start to life under Louis van Gaal, the Belgian is looking the real deal again. He scored a good goal in a decent performance at West Brom, but topped that with an all-action display against Chelsea, as shown in his touch map.
