A firearm was used to kill a former soldier who believed he was a suspect in the Alps Murders case, it emerged today.

The 50-year-old was found dead in his flat in the village of Ugine, eastern France, on Tuesday.

Police, who found evidence of a ‘violent disturbance’, are working on the theory that he committed suicide.

Scene: Police investigate the scene of the murder in the forest near Chevaline and Lake Annecy in 2012

Victims: Engineer Saad al-Hilli (left), the British-Iraqi man killed alongside his wife and mother-in-law. Sylvain Mollier (right), a French cyclist, was also shot dead in the attack

A ‘firearm’ was used to kill the 
unnamed man, a trained marksman who served in a parachute battalion of 
the French Foreign Legion, said Annecy prosecutor Eric Maillaud.

He had been spoken
 to by detectives investigating the bloodbath which claimed the lives of
 three members of the Al-Hilli family, from Surrey.

Sylvain Mollier, a French cyclist, 
was also shot dead in the attack, which took place close to Lake Annecy,
 in eastern France, in September 2012.

Mr
 Maillaud said the man knew Mr Mollier and his family, and left a ‘six 
or seven page note’ saying he was ‘disturbed’ by the questioning because
 it ‘made him feel like a suspect’.

One
 theory in the baffling case is that Mr Mollier, 45, was the main 
target, and that one or more local marksmen could have been responsible.

Investigation: Police outside the Al-Hilli home in Surrey in June 2013, almost a year after the killings happened

Comments: Eric Maillaud, the prosecutor in Annecy, eastern France, said the parachutist left a 'six or seven page note' saying he was 'disturbed' by the questioning because it 'made him feel like a suspect'

Gun collector: Eric Devouassoux, a 48-year-old old former policeman, was arrested over the killings in February and spent four days in custody

Intriguingly, Mr Mollier also lived in Ugine with his heiress girlfriend, who had come into a multi-million pounds fortune. 

Mr
 Maillaud confirmed that the man who died on Tuesday was ‘questioned for
 two hours in April 2013’, mainly because he was ‘linked to Mr Mollier’s
 family’.

Eric 
Devouassoux, a 48-year-old old former policeman from the area, was 
arrested over the killings in February and spent four days in custody.

The
 gun collector is still being investigated for arms trafficking, but 
there has been no legal action linked to the four murders. Zaid al-Hilli, a Surrey financial controller who is related to three of the victims, was the first suspect arrested in 2013.

But
 the 54-year-old has been told by Surrey police that there is not enough
 evidence to charge him with the killing of his brother Saad, 50.

The younger Al-Hilli was shot dead alongside his wife Iqbal, 47, his mother-in-law Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, and Mr Mollier.

The Al-Hilli’s daughters, Zainab, seven, and Zeena, four, survived the attack and are currently in the care of surviving family.

Investigators say that whoever carried out the crime is likely to be a 
trained marksman, and to know the local area extremely well.
