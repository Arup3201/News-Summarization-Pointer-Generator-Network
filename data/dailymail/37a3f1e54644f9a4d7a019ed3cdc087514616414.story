She shot to fame as the half-naked cavorting star of Robin Thicke's steamy Blurred Lines video and landed a role in Gone Girl alongside industry heavyweights Ben Affleck and Rosamind Pike.

But Emily Ratajkowski just got a whole lot cooler. 

The 23-year-old, who is already a pin-up for men worldwide, has been unveiled as the star of the new Call of Duty game trailer.

Guess who! Emily Ratajkowski, who is already a pin-up for men worldwide, has been unveiled as the star of the new Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare game trailer

The American model, who saw her star rocket since being cast in the video for the controversial song featuring T.I. and Pharrell last year, stars alongside actor Taylor Kitsch in the new trailer for Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare. 

The trailer is set in the first person view and sees the viewer fighting with Kitsch - who has just been confirmed to star in the second series of True Detective. 

Set in a fantasy war zone in Lagos in 2059, Kitsch bumps into a mirage played by a sultry looking Ratajkowski, who bares her midriff and legs in a revealing outfit.

The new game, which is out on November 4, has been in development for three years and men worldwide have been counting down the days until it hits the shops.

The other star: The trailer sees the viewer fighting with Taylor Kitsch - who has just been confirmed to star in the second series of True Detective and is known for his roles in Friday Night Lights and X-Men Origins: Wolverine

This just the latest in a series of coup's for the Blurred Lines beauty, who has also recently been seen filming We Are Your Friends in Los Angeles alongside Zac Efron.

The star has no trouble attracting men (and we're sure this new trailer will only heighten her appeal), but Emily revealed she is more interested in casual flings than a long-term relationship right now.

On Tuesday, the model posted a sexy picture of herself wearing a skimpy bikini to her Twitter account, just weeks after speaking to America's Cosmopolitan magazine about her sex life.

She told the publication: 'I feel lucky that I can wear what I want, sleep with who I want, and dance how I want, and still be a feminist.' 

And, according to the Daily Star, she reportedly told the magazine: 'If I want to have casual sex, I'll do it.'

She is also reported to have said: 'I'm not the girl who will handcuff someone the first time I sleep with him. But I'm also not going to cry during sex because I think it is so romantic.'  

Who's that girl? She shot to fame as the half-naked cavorting star of Robin Thicke's steamy Blurred Lines video and landed a role in Gone Girl, the year's most hotly anticipated movies alongside industry heavyweights Ben Affleck and Rosamind Pike

Projects: The 5ft 7in star has also recently been seen filming We Are Your Friends in Los Angeles alongside Zac Efron. The drama centres around a DJ trying to make the big time with his first hit track
