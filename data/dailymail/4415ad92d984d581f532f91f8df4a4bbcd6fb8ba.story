She was the victim of female genital mutilation (FGM) at the age of nine and has been fighting the mental and physical scars ever since, frightened that she would never experience the joy of becoming a mother.

Now 26-year-old Khadija Gbla is celebrating what she describes as a ‘miracle’ after she gave birth to a beautiful, healthy, baby boy, weighing almost three kilos, on Monday night.

Samuel Williams Jr, named after his father, was delivered by emergency caesarean section in Adelaide’s Women's & Children's Hospital at 11.14pm after Khadija went into early labour.

The FGM campaigner said there are no words to describe the anticipation she felt as the doctors were ‘tugging and pulling and getting him out’. The pregnancy that she had sometimes imagined was an impossible dream suddenly became real.

‘When they showed him to me, I didn’t think I’d ever seen a more beautiful sight in my life. He is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.’

Samuel was named after his father (left) and has been described as a 'miracle' after Khadija never believed she would be able to have her own children

‘Sometimes I thought FGM had won but when I saw him I finally thought “yes I am really having a baby”. It is such a miracle and a gift,’ she said. 

Khadija, who lives in Adelaide with her husband Samuel, was nine years old when her mother took her into the bush in Gambia, Africa, and pinned her down while an old lady 'operated' on her with a rusty knife.

Khadija was nine-years-old when her mother took her into the bush in The Gambia to have her circumcised

‘She started hacking away. I remember the pain and trauma of it. The knife was so rusty it felt like it was going on forever,’ she told Daily Mail Australia in December while she was 10 months pregnant.

‘I thought they were going to slaughter me. She lay on my body above what I now know as a clitoris and cut off that piece of flesh,’ she recalled.

Khadija was born in Sierra Leone but when war broke out in 1991 her family moved to The Gambia for safety and then on to Australia when they were granted refugee status in 2001.

As a child Khadija didn’t know what had happened to her or why and for years a state of amnesia stopped her recalling that terrifying day.

She now runs the charity NO FGM Australia providing help and advice to other survivors and the one in three girls a day who are still at risk of having their genitals 'mutilated' in Australia.

When Khadija became pregnant she was honest about how her FGM experience was impacting on what should be a happy time.

She had to deal with health professionals with ‘a lack of knowledge and sensitivity’ and just two months before her due date she still did not know if she would be able to have a vaginal birth due to her scarring.

‘I’m scared it’s going to be like FGM all over again,’ she said in December.

Internal vaginal scarring could have caused her baby’s head to become stuck if she gave birth without a caesarean.

So when her contractions began on Monday night, Khadija felt a sense of panic when she called the pregnancy hotline and was simply advised to tell her husband to get the towels ready.

‘I thought “oh no I’m not having this baby vaginally”… they rushed me to the hospital but they said if the baby’s head was too low already it might have to be a virginal birth.

The pregnancy that Khadija had sometimes imagined was all an impossible dream finally feels real

‘I thought “this can’t be happening”… but they got me to hospital and that’s when my waters broke. They still had time to get me into theatre and stop my nightmare coming true,’ she said.

‘For a couple of hours I was in a lot of pain and there were a lot of F words.’

‘It all worked out in the end… for my baby to come into the world in the least traumatic way possible for both of us. There was drama but I wouldn’t have had it any other way,’ she added.

Khadija is cherishing her first few days as a new mother.

‘I don’t want to let him out of my sight. I didn’t let my husband hold him, I said “he’s mine, he’s mine”,’ she laughed.

‘I keep thinking “wow I made that, that came from me, it’s overwhelming. He’s absolutely gorgeous”.’

And she can already spot signs of baby Samuel’s personality. ‘His eyes are wide open, he’s very peaceful, he eats a lot and is a little mini Khadija, he’s very feisty and already a strong, strong man,’ she gushed.

Female genital mutilation (FGM) comprises all procedures that involve altering or injuring the female genitalia for non-medical reasons, the United Nations says. It is recognised internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women.

Over 140 million girls and women alive today have undergone some form of FGM.

If current trends continue, about 86 million additional girls worldwide will be subjected to the practice by 2030.

FGM is mostly carried out on young girls sometime between infancy and age 15.

FGM causes severe bleeding and health issues including cysts, infections, infertility as well as complications in childbirth increased risk of newborn deaths. 

WHO IS 'AT RISK' OF FGM IN AUSTRALIA?

A girl is 'at risk' if: 

When her husband saw Samuel for the first time ‘he fell in love at first sight’.

‘It was absolutely beautiful to see a man get emotional like that and he didn’t want to give me the baby either, there is a bit of a competition.

‘It’s so surreal for both of us watching him sleep and thinking he’s here, he’s finally here.’

She hopes Samuel will be ‘a happy healthy baby’, who grows into ‘a man who is compassionate and kind and a feminist - if I have anything to do with it’.

Despite still being in hospital recovering from the dramatic birth of her first child, Khadija can’t wait to get back to advocating.

The tireless campaigner said the last nine months have been ‘such a learning experience’. And now she’s ready to put what she’s learned to good use for other FGM survivors.

‘There is no down time. This is my passion. This is not work. This is what I live for… it’s too important not to do,’ she said.

'There is no down time': Khadija can’t wait to get back to advocating for FGM survivors and will do it with baby Samuel by her side who she hopes will grow up to be a 'feminist' 

Friday marks the United Nations International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation and Khadija hopes her story can encourage more people ‘to break the silence’.

‘The silence allows abuse to continue. When you break the silence you say “no” to the abuse.’

There’s no doubt about it, Khadija will continue fighting to give FGM survivors their ‘womanhood back’ with access to mental and physical health services and she won’t stop campaigning to make people realise that mutilating children is child abuse and not a cultural problem.
