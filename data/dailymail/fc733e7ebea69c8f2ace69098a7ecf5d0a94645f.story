Any England fans hoping their Gallic neighbours might provide a pick-me-up of sorts by succumbing to Switzerland were simply placed in a deeper state of disillusion after France produced a ferocious performance that suggested they may remain in Brazil for a good while longer.

Goals from Olivier Giroud, Blaise Matuidi, Mathieu Valbuena, Karim Benzema and Moussa Sissoko saw Ottmar Hitzfeld’s team destroyed in Salvador and promoted France to genuine title contenders.  

It certainly seems a lifetime since Didier Deschamps’s side were 2-0 down to Ukraine in the play-offs for this World Cup and on the verge of missing the tournament altogether.

That this brilliant display came four 
years to the day since the French squad went on strike in South Africa 
throws the result into even sharper relief.     

This
 time everything is clicking and they will win Group E, thus likely 
avoiding Argentina in the second round, unless something dramatic 
occurs. The only other time France won both their opening games at a 
World Cup was in 1998, and we know what happened after that.

Switzerland
 have long boasted a fine defensive record at World Cups but France tore
 them apart with a first half of pace, pressure and poise that left 
Hitzfeld’s players looking bewildered.

How
 much of that was down to Steve Von Bergen’s departure after just eight 
minutes with a suspected fractured cheekbone is open to speculation. 
What is clear is that after he was forced off to hospital, following a 
brutal connection with Giroud’s high boot, Switzerland developed more 
holes than one of their famous cheeses.

New
 Aston Villa defender Philippe Senderos arrived to join his ex-Arsenal 
team-mate Johan Djourou and both showed why they are no longer in Arsene
 Wenger’s ranks.

At a corner
 in the 17th minute a current resident of north London put France ahead.
 Yohan Cabaye swung across an out-swinging corner and Giroud rose 
unchallenged to power a header at goal. Diego Benaglio got fingers to 
the ball but only succeeded in diverting it over the man on the line.

Racing away: Blaise Matuidi wheels away after his slick finish for France's second goal

Taking chances: Matuidi picks up the ball on the break from Karim Benzema and finishes with aplomb

Beaten: Swiss keeper Diego Benaglio is too late as Matuidi's shot beats him at his near post

Down and out: Swiss star Xherdan Shaqiri's face tells the story as his side go 2-0 down after 18 minutes

It was France's 100th goal at a World Cup finals and reward for Deschamps in restoring Giroud to the starting line-up.

Within
 13 seconds of the restart France went had their 101st. Valon Behrami 
played a blind pass and Benzema pounced, advancing quickly and releasing
 Matuidi down the left channel. The Paris Saint-Germain midfielder 
whipped a left-foot shot that beat Benaglio at his near post when it 
really shouldn’t have.  

It 
was two goals conceded by Switzerland in 66 seconds, the same amount as 
they had allowed in the previous 750 minutes of World Cup action spread 
over eight years. In 2006 they were knocked out without letting in one.

Hitzfeld’s
 team did respond for a brief flicker when Admir Mehmedi ran through 
midfield and unleashed a low shot that Hugo LLoris could only palm to 
Xherdan Shaqiri. The Liverpool target was denied only by the slenderest 
touch by the Tottenham goalkeeper that went undetected by the officials.

Stacks on: Matuidi (centre) is swamped by his team-mates as they double their lead within a minute

Tripped: Real Madrid front man Benzema is brought down by Stefan Lichtsteiner in the corner of the penalty area

Picked it: Benaglio goes the right way to save Benzema's spot-kick

Rebound: Yohan Cabaye is first there after the save but his jumping volley only clatters into the crossbar

Dutch
 referee Bjorn Kuipers was more alert in the 31st minute when he 
correctly awarded France a penalty for a clumsy challenge by Djorou on 
Benzema. The Real Madrid striker, who bagged two in the opening game, 
stepped up to take the spot-kick but was denied by Benaglio. It seemed 
certain Cabaye would put the rebound in as he advanced onto the falling 
ball but the ex-Newcastle man curiously chose to volley rather than head
 and crashed it against the bar.

No
 matter, nine minutes later France would have their third in 
breath-taking fashion. Switzerland had a corner but 14 seconds and four 
passes later the ball was in their net.

Benzema
 fed Raphael Varane, who produced a sublime pass to the galloping 
Giroud. The Arsenal striker squared it to Valbuena at the far post and 
the diminutive midfielder applied a finish. It was stunning stuff.  

Benzema
 progress his golden boot chances by scoring midway through the second 
half. Paul Pogba, on as a substitute, sliced a lovely ball forward, 
Senderos hacked horribly and Benzema fired in his ninth goal in nine 
internationals.

Body behind it: Benaglio got his whole torso behind the spot kick to avoid going down 3-0, momentarilly

Blood bin: Defender Steve von Bergen (left) goes off bleeding from a wound near his eye

Nightmare start: Von Bergen goes down in the opening minutes of the group E clash after a collision

Piggy-back to last-16?: Mathieu Valbuena (left) jumps on Giroud after extending the lead to 3-0

Put away: Valbuena latched onto a low cross from Giroud following a slick counter-attack

Gratefully received: Benaglio scrambles but has no chance as France's lead becomes a mountain for the Swiss

On the money: Benzema scored France's fourth with this finish between Benaglio's legs

Another 
lovely move 20 minutes from time made it five. Benzema fed Sissoko, 
whose first time hit across goal whistled in. Saves from Benaglio and 
last-ditch clearances prevented an even bigger rout and Switzerland got 
two of their own late on as the French switched off.

Nine
 minutes from time Blerim Dzemaili fired a low free-kick through a 
pathetic French wall to defeat Lloris and then Granit Xhaka got another 
back with a superb volley. This group could come down to goal difference
 and those strikes could prove important.

Benzema
 thought he had scored a superb second with the last kick of the game 
after curling in from the edge of the area. He ran off celebrating but 
Kuipers had already blown up.

It is far from the final whistle for this exciting French side however.
