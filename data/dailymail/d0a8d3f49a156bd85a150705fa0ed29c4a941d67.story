Ross McCormack is set to leave cash-strapped Leeds United after manager Brian McDermott lost his job.

McCormack, 27, was the Championship’s top scorer last season with 29 goals and the Scotland striker handed much of the credit to McDermott, who spent less than 14 months in the job.

McCormack, rated by Leeds at about £8million, is wanted by a host of clubs headed by Celtic, West Ham, Leicester and Malaga.

Most wanted: Ross McCormack (2L) is set to leave struggling Leeds for around £8m with several clubs interested

He is understood to be deeply upset by the manager’s treatment.

McCormack recently said: ‘Everyone knows what I think of Brian. He has to be given a chance to do his job properly. He deserves that at least.’
