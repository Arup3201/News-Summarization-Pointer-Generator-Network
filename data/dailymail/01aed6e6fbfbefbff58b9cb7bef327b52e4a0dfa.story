A surge in interest in the Greens has taken the party to 11 per cent in a new opinion poll.

The new survey by Lord Ashcroft puts the Greens up three points in just a week, ahead of the Lib Dems and just behind Ukip, after their profile was boosted by a row over being excluded from TV debates.

The poll and focus group findings will make grim reading for the other parties, with Labour and the Tories both on less than 30 per cent and Ed Miliband likened to a zoo animal 'you're not bothered whether you see or not'.

While much attention has been focused on the rise of Ukip in recent months, the Greens have made steady gains.

The party boasts that its membership had reached 44,175 in England and Wales, higher than the 41,943 claimed by Ukip last week and almost level with the 44,526 issued by the Liberal Democrats in November.

The Labour party has been warned it has failed to take the threat of the Green party seriously.

One in five people saying they will back the Greens voted Lib Dem in 2010, precisely the people Labour needs to woo to win.

The Ashcroft survey puts the Tories ahead on 29 per cent and Labour on 28 per cent. Ukip is on 15 per cent, and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.

Lord Ashcroft said: 'One factor could be that the Greens have benefited from their prominence in the arguments over TV debates – in which case it will be interesting to see in the coming weeks whether they can sustain their share.'

As a nation of animal lovers, it is no surprise Britons come to see their politicians as members of the animal kingdom.

But a lot depends on whether they are a predator or prey depends.

Lord Ashcroft asked a series of focus groups what they thought of the party leaders.

He found David Cameron was viewed as a fox for 'being smart and sleek' while others described the PM as a giraffe, 'looking down on everybody'.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage was branded a peacock or a weasel while Nick Clegg was dismissed as 'a Chihuahua in David Cameron’s handbag'.

But Labour's Ed Miliband left most voters blank, telling the pollster: 'Certainly not a predator… one of those animals that, when you go to the zoo, you’re not bothered whether you see it or not.'

Today Green party leader Natalie Bennett predicted a 'political earthquake' at the general election and said believes that the public are moving away from 'business-as-usual politics'.

She said it was vital for her party to be included in any TV debates to provide balance as voters are moving away from the 'old boys' club' of Westminster.

Ms Bennett was speaking at the launch of a poster campaign aimed at the leaders of the main parties, entitled 'What are you afraid of, boys?', to challenge broadcasters to include the Greens in any televised debates between party leaders.

Ms Bennett said: 'I have seen a whole slew of surveys last week that showed that the public want the Green Party represented in these debates, and of course we had a petition with 275,000 people saying, 'invite the Greens'.

'The arguments don't stack up - the broadcasters have to invite the Greens.'

'It is very clear that we should be there if this is going to be a balanced debate.'

Ms Bennett said it was time to move on from the traditional 'old boys' club of Westminster, and that debates should be inclusive and help promote that.

Last week she wrote to Labour leader Ed Miliband, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Ukip Leader Nigel Farage, urging them to back calls for them to be involved in the debates. She revealed Mr Farage had written back to her, 'basically saying 'no'.'

'This is the Green surge,' Ms Bennett said. 'We don't know where it is going, but it is certain that politics in Britain is not going to be the same again, and that is a very good thing.

'Let's get past the debating about the debates and let's actually debate the issues that we so desperately need, given the state of Britain today.'

Asked what sort of animal Labour's Ed Miliband would be, the focus group told the pollster: 'Certainly not a predator… one of those animals that, when you go to the zoo, you’re not bothered whether you see it or not.' David Cameron was viewed by voters as a fox for 'being smart and sleek' while others described the PM as a giraffe, 'looking down on everybody'

Ms Bennett said the 'Green surge' pointed to the fact that politics is changing 'very fast', and that the main political parties were afraid of the political ground shifting.

She said: 'There is a real potential at this election that we could see politics break wide open.'

Polls and studies suggest Britain politics faces being plunged into chaos after the election, with at least three parties would be needed to form a coalition.

At the weekend political commentator Iain Dale predict Labour will win 300 seats and the Tories 279, but both would need at least two other parties to secure a majority of the 650 MPs in the Commons. 

A separate survey showed a third of Scots want to see Britain run by a Labour-SNP coalition which could put Alex Salmond in the Cabinet.

Mr Miliband faces the grim prospect of a Labour wipeout north of the border, seriously damaging his hopes of securing an overall majority in the general election in May.
