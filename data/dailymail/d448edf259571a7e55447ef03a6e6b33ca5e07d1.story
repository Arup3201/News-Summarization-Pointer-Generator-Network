The 'quiet beer' that turned into an impromptu tip to Thailand has described it as 'a truly crazy experience', with a series of photos revealing the exploits of two Middlesbrough men who have become an internet sensation.

Phillip Boyle and friend Jamie Blyth made headlines all over the world when it was revealed that a drink in their local pub turned into an all-nighter and a flight out to the Far East.

Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Mr Boyle has revealed how the madness continued throughout the duration of the two-day trip - not all of it positive though.

'Going out there was the roughest part in all honesty, as we were both suffering from hangovers, but once we got to Thailand, we threw ourselves into it,' said the 33-year-old company director.

'It was a crazy decision to make, booking flights out there after a session on the beers, but I don't regret it at all, it was a brilliant trip and a truly crazy experience.

'We knew some lads out there, and there's a big community from the UK, so it was great to catch up with people.

'We were out all the time, going for meals and having drinks in bars and pubs, we didn't get the chance to travel around much.' 

Mr Boyle, who paid £550 for a return flight and £60 for a two-night stay in Pattaya, revealed that he decided to upgrade his luggage after only heading out with a Tesco bag 'full of boxers and T-shirts'.

'When I got there I bought a bag and some trainers from Levis,' he added.

However, on checking out of one hotel after their first night's stay, Mr Boyle fell on some hard luck.

'We were checking out, and there was a bit of confusion. One guy started to get involved in the conversation, we had no idea who he was.

The pair flew from Manchester Airport to Pattaya, Thailand with a stopover in Abu Dhabi 

'The next minute I looked down and my trainers had gone - he must have had his eye on them and that's why he came over.'

Determined not to let the theft ruin his holiday, Mr Boyle continued the party - matching up shorts with a pair of black shoes.

'We got to Bangkok, and decided we had to get a motorbike as the taxi wasn't going anywhere and it was really busy,' he added.

'But there was no way I was getting on one barefoot, so I reached into my bag and pulled out my brogues and off we went.'

The pair had arranged through Facebook to meet an old friend, David Lamb, who was in Thailand at the time.

The friends used to play football in the UK with Mr Lamb, who works in Australia and was visiting Thailand following a wedding.

'It was great to catch up with people we knew, and it was just a brilliant trip,' added Mr Boyle.

'It was definitely worth doing for the sheer craic of it.'

It's been somewhat of a comedown for Mr Boyle since he returned to the UK on Monday, and he has found himself behind with his work.

'Going away has meant I've let some people down in work terms, and that's never easy,' he added. 

'I'm finding myself a bit behind now, but I wouldn't swap our experience for anything.' 

His friend, however, might have some more pressing explaining to do, as Mr Boyle explained.

'Jamie's got a girlfriend, and it was a real battle just to get hold of his passport to head out to Thailand.

'But it's only two days we were out there, not two weeks, so I'm hoping he should be OK.'
