Vodquila is making waves in the drinks industry

Embarrassment levels following a very drunken office party could be about to get even worse.

Two of the spirits most likely to make us dance on a table and attempt Britney Spears on karaoke have been combined into one lethal drink. 

Vodka and tequila are now available together in one bottle. That's right, Vodquila is here and it's coming to the UK on Amazon soon.  

The next time you find yourself hugging the porcelain bowl, the people responsible could be  American Chander Arora and his daughter Nina.

The pair came across the idea when Chander was mixing one of his evening cocktails at home in Birmingham, Alabama. 

His daughter Nina asked why he had never tried to combine his two favourite drinks - vodka and tequila - and the booze revolution was born. 

The drink tasted good enough for them to take the idea seriously. 

First of all, Nina developed it as a project during college, then afterwards her brother Romie joined the team and they started to look at is as a serious business plan that could do well in the American drinks market.

Chander Aurora and his daughter Nina came up with the idea to mix tequila and vodka into one hybrid when he spent an evening making cocktails at their Alabama home. 

They put the mix through a proper distilling process that resulted in a product good enough for USA brand Red Eye Louie’s to place on supermarket shelves. 

The vodka is distilled six times, while the tequila is made from Pure Blue Agave Plants, the two drinks are then blended together in small vats, macerated together at a high temperature to achieve a smooth blend. 

And while it possibly won't do much for your stomach the following morning, the tipple is making waves in the drinks industry - it won a silver medal at this year's prestigious International Wine and Spirit Competition. 

The International Wine and Spirit Competition is seen as a very prestigious event in the world of alcohol tasting 

Co-Founder of Vodquila, Romie Arora said: 'It was actually my sister who came up with the vodka and tequila idea.

'My dad and I thought there was definitely a space in the market for a new spirit and so we decided to pursue it - it sure has taken off from there! 

Ewan Lacey, General Manager of the International Wine and Spirit Competition was impressed the by taste of Vodquila 

'I believe Red Eye Louie’s Vodquila has had so much success because it gives you the best of both worlds. 

'It’s a huge achievement for us to have won an award in this year’s International Wine and Spirit Competition as it is recognised as one of the oldest and most prestigious spirit and wine competitions in the world.'

The combination made such a stir at the awards that they are now seriously considering a new section of the competition just for hybrid alcohols. 

Ewan Lacey, General Manager of the International Wine and Spirit Competition said: 'Vodquila initially intrigued the IWSC judges in the blind tasting, but the spirit proved it’s no gimmick when it was awarded a Silver Medal. 

'This is a whole new world of innovation in the spirits industry. 

'It's outstanding that something initially created for a college project can make such an impact on the spirits market by creating a new category of its own. 

'It’s affordable too, great for mixing in both classic tequila & vodka cocktails.'
