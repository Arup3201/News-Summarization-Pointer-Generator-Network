Network Rail bosses were yesterday shamed into giving up bonus payments worth up to £1.4million.

The decision follows a ferocious public backlash against plans which could have seen the taxpayer-funded firm’s six executive directors share a total of £20million by 2015.

Last week Network Rail was forced to apologise after it admitted health and safety breaches over the deaths of two teenage girls at a level crossing in 2005.

Unprecedented step: Transport Secretary 
Justine Greening had planned to attend the Network Rail members' meeting
on Friday  to shame executives, such as chief Sir David Higgins, into 
giving 
up their bonuses

It said yesterday that its executive 
directors would hand any bonuses they received this year –which are 
expected to total up to £1.4million – to a ‘safety fund’ to improve 
level crossings.

The firm – which receives £4billion a year from the public purse to run the rail network – also said it would rethink plans for a long-term bonus scheme that could hand the directors up to £15.6million over the next three years.

Taken with their annual bonus payments over that time, the bonuses could have totalled £20million by 2015.

The climbdown came after Transport 
Secretary Justine Greening threatened to gatecrash a meeting on Friday 
that had been set to rubber-stamp the bonus package.

Yesterday the firm said the meeting had been shelved while it ‘reflected’ on the level of bonuses it should offer.

The directors on the Network Rail board were each entitled to bonus payments of up to 60 per cent of their salary this year - which could have been worth £1,392,000.

The discretionary payouts are dependent on performance targets being hit - but chief-executive Sir David Higgins could have pocketed £336,000 - on top of his £560,000 basic salary.

In total, the generous bonus package could have been worth £20million to the board between now and 2015. Under complicated arrangements, the directors receive both 'short-term' annual bonuses and 'long-term' bonuses.

A spokesman for Network Rail said a new incentives package for subsequent years will now have to be agreed.

Given the pressure being exerted by the Government to cut executive pay, in future bonuses are unlikely to be anything like as extravagant.

Below are the salaries each of the Network Rail Board members receives and in brackets the bonus they could have received this year.

Sir David Higgins - Chief-Executive £560,000, (£336,000)

Patrick Butcher - Group Finance Director £350,000, (£210,000)

Robin Gisby - Director, Operations & Customer Services £330,000, (£198,000)

Peter Henderson - Director, Asset Management £440,000, (£264,000)

Simon Kirby - Director, Investment Projects £330,000, (£198,000)

Paul Plummer £310,000, (£186,0

Miss Greening, who described the bonus proposals as ‘unacceptable’, last night welcomed the ‘sensible’ U-turn.

She said: ‘I have made it clear to Network Rail at every stage that this proposed package did not go far enough in reflecting the need for restraint.

‘The fact that its executive directors have also chosen to forfeit their annual bonuses to improve level crossings is a sign that they have recognised the strength of public opinion.’

Downing Street last night urged other organisations to ‘reflect’ on the move.

The Prime Minister’s spokesman said: ‘All parts of the public sector should be reflecting on the financial environment and taking responsible decisions.’

However, Network Rail last night confirmed that it would be bringing forward new proposals for executive bonuses in the coming weeks.

It issued a statement saying it would ‘take the opportunity to reflect further on how to incentivise performance in the company against the backdrop of the current context’.

A spokesman said the firm had a legal duty to offer bonuses to its staff. 

One of the firm’s 78-strong members’ board told the Daily Mail that bonuses were being used as a substitute for pay rises.

He said three directors had threatened to quit unless they received the cash.

Chief executive Sir David Higgins, who is
paid a basic salary of £560,000, was in line for a £336,000 annual 
bonus and a £1.8million long-term bonus.

Last week he apologised on behalf of Network Rail after it admitted 
health and safety breaches over the deaths of Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and
Charlotte Thompson, 13, who were hit by a train in 2005 at Elsenham 
station in Essex.

The directors’ decision to donate their bonuses to a safety fund was 
welcomed by Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, who said: 
‘This decision is sadly too little, too late for the parents of the 
girls who tragically died.

‘But we welcome it as  the first step in the direction of the directors 
starting to put safety and the passengers ahead of their own handsome 
rewards.’

Higgins was announced

Tory MP Anne Main, who led a Commons debate on the issue last week, 
urged ministers to ensure that the firm was not able to slip through 
proposals for big bonuses when public controversy about the issue dies 
down.

She said: ‘The original proposals were a disgrace.

‘They should be ashamed that they were even considering these massive bonuses at a time when performance is getting worse.

‘It is welcome that they are going to waive their bonuses this year, but this must not become a one-off gesture.’
