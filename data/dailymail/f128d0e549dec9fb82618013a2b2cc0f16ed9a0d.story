Police are on the hunt for 'armed and dangerous, anti-government' couple who are accused of abducting their two young sons from the home of their grandparents just days after losing their parental rights, authorities said on Tuesday.

Cole Hakken, four, and his two-year-old brother, Chase, were snatched by father, Joshua, at 6.30am this morning in Tampa, Florida. He drove off with his sons after tying up their maternal grandmother, Patricia Hauser.

A national Amber Alert has been issued, the  Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office reported. Both boys have brown hair and brown eyes and were last seen wearing their pajamas.

Hakken and his wife Sharyn, 34, are considered armed and dangerous.

According to the Tampa Bay Times, Joshua Hakken waited until his father-in-law had left for work before he sneaked into the home and tied up Mrs Hauser with zip ties.

Police were alerted two hours later after the grandmother managed to free herself and dialed 911.

Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said in a statement: 'Both suspects are anti-government and have attempted a previous abduction at gunpoint in Louisiana.'

Officials say the couple have been 
stripped of their parental rights earlier this week after having the 
boys removed from their care months earlier.

Authorities in Louisiana have told 
Florida deputies that the children were initially placed in a foster 
care center. At some point, the Hakkens arrived at the facility armed 
with guns and unsuccessfully attempted to enter it.

Chase and Cole Hakken were later sent to live with their grandmother in Tampa, who was granted permanent custody of the boys.

Joshua Hakken, 35, fled the home on Shady Shores Drive in Ms Hauser's 2009 Silver Toyota Camry.

It is believed that they could now be traveling in a black 2006 GMC pick-up truck with Florida tag number U95KT. They may be pulling a 2012 Forrest River pop camper, Florida tag: BHNV-86.

The
 vehicle may have been spotted in the area of Highway 30 and Highway 411
 in Etowah, Tennessee Wednesday night around 8pm, WBIR reported. The couple also have 
ties to Slidell, Louisiana, and may be heading there.     

Anyone with any information is
 asked to dial 911 or call the Hillsborough County 
Sheriff’s Office at 247 8200.

The sheriff's office told CNN that 
the Hakkens' troubles started last June when the husband was arrested on
 multiple drug charges while attending an anti-government rally in 
Louisiana.

Crime scene: Officials say Joshua Hakken entered a home in the 14000 block of Shady Shores Drive owned by his sons' maternal grandmother, tied up the woman and abducted the boys

Detective Daniel Seuzeneau, with the Slidell Police Department, told WGNO that Joshua Hakken had first appeared on their radar in June 17, 2012, after causing disturbance inside a hotel that was the site of an anti-government rally.

He described the father of two as being intoxicated and making incoherent statements. Hakken was arrested on multiple drug charges and jailed for about a week.

Meanwhile, police contacted the Department of Children and Family Services, which took the Hakkens' children into custody.

Sheriff's Cpl. Kevin Bodie told Tampa Bay Times that Hakken is a mechanical engineer who owns a business in South Tampa. His wife has been certified as a civil engineer.

According to her Facebook page, Sharyn Hakken got her Bachelor's degree from University of South Florida in geotechnical engineering in 2001 before obtaining a Master's degree in civil engineering from USF in 2008.

Last February, someone by the user name SailingBull posted on the libertarian forum Adam vs The Man that was started by Adam Charles Kokesh, an Iraq War veteran, activist and talk radio host who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in New Mexico.

'My name is Joshua Hakken,' the forum member wrote. 'I am a father, a registered professional mechanical engineer and a veteran of the USAF. I am absolutely devoted to life, liberty, the rights of the individual and the Constitution of the United States of America.'

Hakken lamented that 'things here in Florida have not added up for quite some time,' and emphasized the importance of 'maintaining open communication lines for ideas, observations and news...if the "good guys" are to be successful in surviving to maintain the fight of ideas.'

The couple own a home in the Virginia Park area south of Palma Ceia, where neighbors described them as a normal, average family. While Robert Lucas said the Hakkens were not overly outgoing, that did not seem like bad people.

However, neighbor Lindsay Fleming recalled that one time, the parents were puffing on marijuana joints outside their home with their toddler sons nearby.
