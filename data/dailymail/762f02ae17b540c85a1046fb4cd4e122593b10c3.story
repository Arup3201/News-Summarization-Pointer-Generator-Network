Tyne Yates, 23, has been jailed for 18 months for theft, burglary, taking two vehicles without consent and driving while disqualified and without insurance

The granddaughter of a respected magistrate made sexual advances towards elderly men so she could pickpocket their wallets.

Tyne Yates, 23, targeted vulnerable old men out walking alone and then distracted her victims by hugging or groping them.

While manhandling them she would put her hand into their jacket pockets and steal their wallets and mobile phones before walking off.

Yates, who has serious drug and drink problems, targeted the vulnerable old men as they walked on Blackpool Promenade.

One 87-year-old widower, who was on a break in the seaside resort following the death of his wife, was a victim of her ‘Kiss Me Quick’ thefts.

In a two-year campaign she is believed to have struck numerous times but many of her victims are thought to be too embarrassed to report it to police.

Last night Yates was behind bars, starting an 18-month jail term after she admitted four charges of theft and a burglary.

She also admitted taking two vehicles without their owners’ consent, driving while disqualified and driving without insurance.

Preston Crown Court heard Yates shunned her middle-class background and went off the rails despite her grandparents being pillars of the community and leading political figures in the Lancashire town.

Her grandmother Sylvia Taylor, a 
magistrate and Labour councillor, was a former mayor of the seaside 
resort until she retired earlier in the year.

Yates’s grandfather Ivan 
Taylor, a company director, was also a former mayor of  the town, head 
of education and social services and sits on the joint executive and 
scrutiny panel for Blackpool Council.

The
couple, both 74, who had adopted Yates’s mother Lisa as a child and  
later set her up in her own home, were too upset to talk about the case 
yesterday.

When contacted about her granddaughter Mrs Taylor said: ‘I’m sorry but we don’t want to talk about it.’

But
one of their neighbours said: ‘It’s such a shame because they’re a 
lovely couple who have given so much public service and done so much 
good in Blackpool. They doted on this girl yet it seems she has just 
thrown it all back in their faces.’

Yates’s descent into crime began when she was just 15 years old and began to play truant from her high school.

Life of crime: Preston Crown Court heard Yates, pictured in 2009, had a comfortable middle class upbringing but turned to drugs and crime

In
2005, her mother was hauled into court after her daughter went to 
school on only four out of a possible 110 days over a four-month period.

The
teenager had an average attendance rate of just 4 per cent and carried 
on truanting despite repeated visits by education officials. As a result
her mother was ordered to complete community service for failing to 
ensure Yates went to school.

Her
mother died in 2007, at the age of 38. Her death led Yates further into
crime and in 2011 she was charged with stealing a wallet containing £80
after hugging a 74-year-old man on the promenade.

At the time the victim said she asked him for a cigarette then got hold of him by the hips, hugged him and asked him for sex.

He
said ‘no’ and walked away but two witnesses believed a theft had taken 
place and alerted police who arrested Yates and were able to return the 
wallet to the victim.

During
a subsequent police interview Yates said she needed to steal the money 
because she had a serious drug and alcohol habit to feed.

She
was tagged and ordered to go into drug rehabilitation course but she 
was arrested again after she drunkenly crashed a Ford Mondeo car while 
chauffering a 71-year-old businessman from a football match.

The
court heard that in May, Yates had approached a 17-year-old boy and 
asked him if he ‘fancied a cuddle’ before stealing his mobile phone.

Two
days later she approached a 73-year-old man waiting at a bus stop and 
asked for sex in return for money, and began touching him over his 
clothes.

The pensioner said 
he wasn’t interested but afterwards realised his wallet, containing £10 
cash, and his mobile phone had been stolen.

Later
Yates and another girl went to Blackpool promenade where they spotted 
the 87-year-old holidaymaker. Yates asked for money and then asked him 
if he wanted sex with her.

She began to grope the old man and touch him and, as he tried to push her away, she took his wallet containing £100.

Yates
was arrested a month later after committing a burglary with her then 
boyfriend when she ended up driving the victim’s Nissan Primera car.

Peter
Horgan, defending, said Yates was highly ‘embarrassed  and disturbed’ 
by her repeated behaviour of stealing from vulnerable old men.
