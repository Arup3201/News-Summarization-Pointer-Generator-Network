A German court has sensationally thrown out a case against a former Nazi SS member accused of taking part in the massacre of hundreds of French villagers during the Second World War. 

Werner Christukat, 89, had been accused of being a member of an armoured SS division that attacked Oradour-sur-Glane on June 10, 1944 - savagely murdering nearly all of its inhabitants.

But the case against the elderly suspect - who had been charged in January with the murder of 25 people committed by a group, and with aiding and abetting the murder of several hundred others - was dramatically dismissed this morning for lack of evidence.

Christukat, who lives in Cologne, said he is haunted by the massacre of 642 civilians - and although he admitted being in the village with his S.S. regiment on the day, denied ever killing anybody.

Horror: Today Oradour exists as a massive memorial - a chilling time capsule where the burned out homes remain exactly as they were on the day they were torched

The suspected former Nazi's case was being heard in the western German city of Cologne, but a statement released by the court this morning revealed it no longer intended to pursue the case.

Charges against Christukat, who was 19 at the time of the atrocity, were initially filed by the prosecutor's office in Dortmund.

Had he been convicted, it is almost certain Christukat would have spent the rest of his life in jail.

The massacre the man had been accused of taking part in took place in the tiny village of Oradour-sur-Glane in western France on June 10, 1944. It is understood to have been a brutal act of retribution following the purported kidnapping of a Nazi commander.

SS members stormed a barn where 181 men had gathered, using pistols and automatic weapons to murder them all before setting fire to the structure. They are believed to have then moved on to a church where a further 254 women and 207 children were killed using explosives and machine guns.

Christukat says he has had nightmares about the massacre ever since it took place - particularly over one small boy whose life he was unable to save.

'There was this boy,' he said. 'He came walking over the hill. A small blonde boy with a bicycle and he wanted to go past me and into the village. I can still picture it exactly.'

'I stopped him and wanted to chase him away, but then the junior squad leader came up and started yelling at me.'

'Not a night goes by in which I don't think of Oradour. In front of me, I can still see the church through the treetops. I hear a bang and then the screaming of women and children.'

'I can't get it out of my mind. I felt so dreadfully sorry for them. But the worst is that I couldn't save the boy.'

Last September German president Joachim Gauck (left) became the first German leader to visit the site when he joined François Hollande (right) and two of the three living survivors on a tour of Oradour-sur-Glane.

Memories: Hollande and Gauck were accompanied by two of only three living survivors of the Oradour massacre - Robert Hebras, 88, and Jean-Marcel Darthout.

Prosecutors had accused Christukat of helping the massacre take place by either blocking off or acting as a lookout along the road leading to the church, or by carrying flammable material to help burn the building down once the murders had been carried out.

The suspect, who admitted being in Oradour-sur-Glane at the time and confirmed his involvement with the local SS branch, has always denied having anything to do with the massacre of 642 people.

The village has been a ghost town since the massacre, with rusting cars nestled long-abandoned beside the rubble of the burned-out church. 

Today Oradour exists as a massive memorial - a chilling time capsule where the burned out homes remain exactly as they were on the day they were torched, and even the car of the mayor still lies rusting in the main street. 

Location: Oradour-sur-Glane is in central France, approximately 250 miles south of the capital Paris

German soldiers killed all 642 inhabitants, including children. The men were rounded up and shot in barns, the women were herded into the local church which was set ablaze with hand grenades

Homes and business were all torched by rampaging S.S officers, leaving just empty shells remaining

The atrocity is an understandably sensitive subjective for France, and last September German president Joachim Gauck became the first German leader to visit the site when he joined François Hollande and two of the three living survivors on a tour of Oradour-sur-Glane.

In a sign of post-war unity,  Gauck said he felt a 'mixture of gratitude and humility' as he visited the site with his French counterpart Hollande.

The statesman added: 'The Germany that I have the honour of representing is a different Germany from the one that haunts memories.'

In return, Mr Hollande said: 'You have made the choice to visit - this is a tribute to you, and at the same time it forces us, once the past has been acknowledged, to go boldly into the future.'

Hollande and Gauck were accompanied by two of only three living survivors of the Oradour massacre - Robert Hebras, 88, and Jean-Marcel Darthout.

Rubble: Survivors look for the bodies of victims within the remains of the village shortly after the massacre

Destroyed: A burned out building is seen in Oradour-sur-Glane just days after the atrocity took place

A military tribunal opened in Bordeaux in 1953 to try the surviving 65 of the approximately 200 soldiers involved in the massacre.

However, many could not be extradited from the new East Germany, and 14 of them were Alsatians - French nationals of German extraction. 

20 men were found guilty, but were all released from prison within five years.

In 2010, Germany re-opened the war crimes file into the massacre after a historian uncovered evidence implicating several still-living suspects.

Using secret files on individuals created by communist East Germany's Stasi secret police force, prosecutors identified seven previously unknown members of the SS unit that carried the attack.

Investigations are now underway into six of the men. The other suspect is Christukat, against whom charges were dropped today.

Early on the morning of 10 June 1944, the 2nd SS Panzer Division entered the village of Oradour-sur-Glane to avenge the death of a German officer who had been kidnapped by the French Resistance.

They marched into the town and separated the men from the women and children.

The men were taken to six barns and shed while the women and children were locked in the church while the village was looted.

The men were said to be shot in the legs before being doused in petrol and set alight.

Six men escaped although one was later found nearby and shot dead. In total 190 men perished.

The soldiers proceeded to the church and tried to set it alight. Women and children tried to escape through the doors and windows of the church, but were met with machine-gun fire.

A total of 247 women and 205 children died. Two women and one child survived; one was 47-year-old Marguerite Rouffanche. She hauled herself out of a window behind the altar, followed by a young woman and child. German soldiers shot all three of them, killing the woman and child by wounding Rouffanche who escaped into nearby foliage where she stayed until she was rescued the following day.

The following is part of her testimony read out to the 1953 Bordeaux military tribunal:

'Firing burst out in the church then straw, faggots and chairs were thrown pele-mele onto bodies lying on the stone slabs. I had escaped from the killing and was without injury so I made use of a smoke cloud to slip behind the altar. In this part of the church there are three windows. I made for the widest one in the middle and with the help of a stool used to light the candles, I tried to reach it. I don't know how but my strength was multiplied. I heaved myself up to it as best I could and threw myself out of the opening that was offered to me through the already shattered window. I jumped about nine feet down.

'When I looked up I saw I had been followed in my climb by a woman holding out her baby to me. She fell down next to me but the Germans, alerted by the cries of the baby, machine-gunned us. The woman and the mite were killed and I too was injured as I made it to a neighbouring garden and hid among some rows of peas and waited anxiously for someone to come to help me. That wasn't until the following day at 5 p.m.'
