She waited 36 years to visit her daughter's grave.

Now Elaine Joseph has finally been able to pay her respects, by becoming one of the first people to visit a small, windswept island where a million souls are buried.

Tonight her emotional story will feature in a documentary on Hart Island, the final resting place for New York's still-born babies, the homeless and the unclaimed where 1,500 fresh corpses arrive each year.

Access is severely restricted, photos are banned and burials are performed en masse without tombstones by prison inmates.

Island of lost souls: Hart Island off the coast of New York is the final resting place for a million of the city's still-born babies, jobless and homeless - but access is severely restricted and photographs are forbidden

Forbidden: Access to Hart Island and its decaying abandoned prison workhouse is severely restricted. Each white plastic pipe near the building marks an infant mass gravesite, one plastic pipe per 1,000 babies

In November, the 59-year-old nurse became one of eight women to be granted permission to visit after a fierce campaign to stop the dead being omitted from history.

Her daughter Tomika was born two months prematurely in 1978 and lived for just five days, weighing a fragile 4lb 2oz.

But she could not be there when Tomika suffered heart failure, because a snowstorm cut off her route to the hospital. By the time she got there, her daughter's body was already gone.

Ms Joseph told ITV's John Ray, writing in the Daily Mirror: 'They said, "The body’s already gone. You signed the forms so that the City will bury her but don’t worry because the City buries them with all of the other babies and stillborns."

'Anyone who’s a parent, knows that you simply can’t let it go – it’s a part of you.'

At first, she was told only that her baby was buried in Potter's Field.

Later she would discover this was not the name of a real place, but a common term for a pauper's grave. It comes from Biblical times, in which clay fields would be useless for agriculture and used for burying people instead. 

History: Hart Island, at just 131 acres, has had many uses - including as a homelessness and alcoholism rehabilitation centre in the 1950s (pictured). But its solitary jetty is now surrounded by barbed wire

Trench: This photo from 1990 shows a mass burial trench for adults. Pine boxes used as coffins can be seen

City limits: Just within the boundaries of the Bronx, Hart Island is tucked away from the view of most people

Once they arrive at Hart Island, corpses
 are interred in great, anonymous trenches.

There are no tombstones and small white posts in the ground mark each 150 adult bodies. A thousand 
children and infants are buried together per grave, stacked three coffins deep.

The island is run by the Department of Corrections and the men who do the digging are convicts from Rikers Island, petty offenders tasked with carrying bodies to their final resting place.

But it lay largely forgotten until artist Melinda Hunt began a campaign to revive interest in its secrets.

She began the Hart Island Project, mapping the 131-acre island's burial sites and collection stories from people whose relatives were buried there.

By now she has helped around 500 people from as far afield as Poland, Ireland, France and the Netherlands, and listed more than 60,000 burials in the project's database.

She told Mr Ray: 'They line them up sort of like UPS unloading boxes... A morgue truck arrives and it’s full of coffins. Especially if it’s baby coffins, where there are 50 or 60 at once.'

Heartbreaking: Blankets with names, cause of death and date of death, created by Melinda Hunt. The story of Elaine Joseph, who visited her daughter's grave after 36 years, will be shown tonight on ITV1

First used as a cemetery in the Civil War, Hart Island was used as a training camp, a prison for captured Confederates, a workhouse, a mental asylum and a Cold War missile base.

It has just one jetty, which is closed to the public and surrounded by railings, barbed wire and spikes.

Prison authorities long banned visits on the basis that the island's buildings were dilapidated, abandoned and potentially dangerous.

Under pressure, they finally began allowing visits in 2007. But those attending would only be able to stand in a gazebo far from the graves themselves.

Once Elaine Joseph arrived last month, she broke down in tears.

'I
 can't say I found closure,' she said. 'When you lose a child, there really is never
 closure. There is a piece of you that is gone.'

'I did find solace in that there was water surrounding it and there was a lovely view.'

She was even allowed to take a photograph.

Elaine Joseph's story features in On Assignment, which airs tonight at 10.35pm on ITV1.
