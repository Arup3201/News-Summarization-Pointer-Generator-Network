A Russian father who fed parrots, guinea pigs, cats and puppies to his pet snake and filmed the gruesome footage is being hunted by police. 

Father-of-two Andrei Generalov, 32, from St. Petersburg in north-western Russia, started uploading videos of his Boa Constrictor 'King' devouring rats and hamsters. 

But as the videos rose in popularity, he began taking suggestions from viewers who demanded more 'blood and gore'. 

With this in mind, he started feeding 'King' larger animals in the sickening videos, which included terrified puppies. 

In the videos, he tells his audience: 'Why these senseless sacrifices? It's for the sake of food (ha ha).

'I like to film the way the animals fight for their lives, suffer and eventually die.'

The guinea pig tries to wriggle free but the snake has jaws lined with small hooked teeth, for holding their prey

A petition has started in St Petersburg, Russia, by those appalled by the suffering of the animals 

But furious campaigners - outraged at the appalling suffering - began a petition to take Mr Generalov to court. 

After collecting more than 4,000 signatures, they handed it to the prosecutors office who ordered police to arrest him. 

Chief Prosecutor Sergey Litvinenko said: 'An arrest warrant has been put out for this man but he has now disappeared.

'Anyone with information of his whereabouts should contact us or the police directly.'

Local petition signer Tigran Evdokimov, 28, said: 'What this man did was sickening beyond belief.

'To film such cruelty and to enjoy it is the work of a very sick and dangerous man.' 

But his friend, Leopold Polyakov, 35, defended Mr Generalov describing him as a 'good, family man'. 

He said: 'Andrei is a very good man, a family man. He has three cats at home and has never shown any sign of cruelty towards people or animals.

'I find it just incomprehensible that he would do this.' 

Boa Constrictors will eat almost anything they can catch, including birds, monkeys and wild pigs

The boa constrictor is a species of large, non-poisonous snake.

It is a member of the Boidae family and is found in the wild in North, Central and South America, as well as some islands in the Caribbean.

They live for between 20 and 30 years, reach up to 13ft in length and can weigh up to 60lbs or 27kgs.

Like their cousins, Anacondas, Boas are excellent swimmers but prefer to stay on dry land. In the wild they tend to live in hollow logs and mammals burrows.

Their jaws are lined with small hooked teeth, for grabbing and holding their prey, while wrapping their muscular bodies around their victim, squeezing it until it suffocates.

Boas will eat almost anything they can catch, including birds, monkeys and wild pigs.

Their jaws can stretch to allow them to swallow their prey whole.

Female boas incubate their eggs outside their bodies and can give birth to up to 60 babies during their lives.

Some boa constrictors are hunted for their fine, ornate skin and as such, many of the species are endangered.
