Authorities in Maryland have charged Baltimore police officer Alec Eugene Taylor with animal cruelty after they say he killed his girlfriend's puppy and texted her a photo of the dog's body

A 27-year-old Baltimore police officer was taken into custody on Wednesday after he allegedly beat and choked his girlfriend's 7-month-old puppy and texted her a photo of the dog's lifeless body.

Alec Eugene Taylor of Silver Spring, a five-year veteran of the Baltimore department, was charged with aggravated animal cruelty, which is a felony, and abuse or neglect of an animal.

Taylor allegedly confessed that he he beat the Jack Russell Terrier called Rocko because he was tired of the dog defecating on the carpet. He shared the dog with his girlfriend.

County police said that Taylor's girlfriend first called them on Friday February 28 and claimed that Taylor had killed Rocko two days earlier.

They said the girlfriend told them Taylor had texted her a written message that the dog defecated on the carpet and he killed it.

Police said that then Taylor subsequently texted her a photo of what appeared to be a dead dog.

Authorities said Taylor told his girlfriend he had beaten the dog with a mop and then put the body in an outdoor trash bin.

Alec Eugene Taylor, 27, of the 13800 block of Castle Boulevard (pictured), told police he chased the Jack Russell terrier, named Rocko, out from behind a dryer and then throttled it until it was dead

Police said Taylor's girlfriend pleaded with him to retrieve Rocko's body from the dumpster so that she could bury him.

Around 6:30 that evening, she returned home and found the dog's body in a shoebox on the balcony of their apartment. She took it to a park in nearby Hyattsville and buried Rocko.

Officers with the Animal Services Division recovered the body and said a necropsy showed the cause of death was blunt force traumaÂ  which resulted in 'acute hemorrhagic shock,' likely due to blood loss from liver damage.

Authorities said Taylor told Animal Services that he used a mop to force Rocko from behind a dryer and choked the dog with his hands.

Baltimore police said Taylor was suspended without pay on Wednesday.

The department said in a statement, 'Allegations of animal cruelty are taken seriously by the Baltimore Police Department.

Over the course of the last year significant emphasis has been placed on developing and training investigators to handle animal abuse incidents in Baltimore.'

There is no bond information at this time.
