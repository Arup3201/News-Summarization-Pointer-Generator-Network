Simon Gamble is believed to have died one hour after he had been sent home from hospital with chest pains for a second time

A builder died just one hour after he had been sent home by doctors with chest pains after they diagnosed him with anxiety, it has been alleged.

Simon Gamble, 46, is said to have been sent home twice from Clacton District Hospital, in Essex, in the 24 hours before his death.

His mother Chrissie Westgate has now called for a review of the hospital's procedures following the death of her son, of St Osyth, Essex, who leaves two children, aged nine and seven.

Mrs Westgate, of West Mersea, Essex, says her son's 'heart just stopped'.

She said: 'It was horrendous. He had been to Clacton Hospital twice, the day before and the day he died, with pains in his chest.

'Both times he was sent away because they told him he was suffering from anxiety.

'He came out of hospital, went home on his own where within an hour, we think, he died.

'That's awful for us because if only he had phoned us. We might not have found him alive but you don't know.

'We intend to follow it up but can’t until we have the post-mortem examination report.'

Mrs Westgate said her son, who died on January 2, was not an anxious person and did not have underlying heart problems.

She said: 'The coroner phoned and said it was not a heart attack, she said his heart just stopped beating.'

Mr Gamble, who was a keen musician, is said to have been sent home twice from Clacton District Hospital, in Essex, in the 24 hours before his death

Mrs Westgate said the post-mortem examination will be available in three weeks.

She said: 'I wouldn’t dream of suing anyone or anything like that.

'But to send him home twice - why didn’t they send him to Colchester hospital?

'I wasn’t there and I don’t know what he said to them, but somebody should have sent him for further tests.

'We are not the sort of people that are 
going to start shouting and screaming, but we will voice our concerns by
 writing a letter to say in the future we would like their procedure 
taken seriously.'

A spokesman for Anglian Community Enterprise said: 'We would like to offer our sincerest condolences to the family of Mr Gamble on their loss.

Mr Gamble's mother Chrissie Westgate has now called for a review of the hospital's procedures

'Patient confidentially regulations do not allow us to publicly discuss an individual patient’s condition and treatment.

'However, we will investigate the 
circumstances of Mr Gamble’s visit to Clacton Hospital’s minor injuries 
unit on January 2 and if his family wishes to contact us we will, 
naturally, discuss with them any concerns they may have.'

Mr Gamble, who was a keen musician, grew up in Mersea and went to school in Colchester.

His nine-year-old son and seven-year-old daughter live with their mother in Cornwall.

He also leaves his mother Mrs Westgate, father David Gamble and stepmother Valerie, who live in Colchester, and sister, Victoria.

His passions were music and building. He played the guitar, banjo and trombone, which he also taught himself to play.

Mrs Westgate said: 'He was a person who lived totally in the moment.  If he didn’t want to go to work one day, he wouldn’t, he would sit and play guitar.

'Riches didn’t interest him, he just loved life. A friend said to me, however long he lived, no-one was ever going to clip his wings.'

Mrs Westgate said she had received about 160 sympathy cards.

She said: 'Everybody knew him. We have never had so many people phone up and come round and offering condolences. I have been astounded by it, it is humbling.'

About 500 people are expected to attend his funeral in West Mersea on Friday.
