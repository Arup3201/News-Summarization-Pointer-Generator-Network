A man has handed himself in to authorities investigating the disappearance of an elderly couple after they went to buy a car registred on Craigslist.

Vietnam war veteran Elrey 'Bud' Runion, 69, and his wife June, 66, drove from Marietta to McRae on Thursday to meet the would-be seller of their dream car: a 1966 Mustang. 

They were reported missing by their daughter after failing to turn up at her home to babysit. 

On Monday, Ronnie 'Jay' Towns, 28, surrendered himself to authorities.

He had not been accused of harming the Runions before his surrender.  

Suspect: Ronnie 'Jay' Towns, 28, handed himself in to authorities investigating the disappearance on Monday

Bud and June Runion, who are both in their late 60s, drove from Marietta to McRae on Thursday to meet someone who had responded to a Craigslist ad placed by Bud seeking a 1966 Mustang

The missing couple's daughter say their father had wanted a 1966 Mustang ever since he had returned from duty in Vietnam in 1966

Daughter Virginia Owens said she became suspicious after her parents failed to show up to babysit her children on Friday and didn't answer their cell phone 

The couple's last phone call was to Towns, police claim.  

Daughter Virginia Owens said she became suspicious after her parents failed to show up to babysit her children on Friday and didn't answer their cell phone. 

The couple were driving a champagne colored 2003 GMC Envoy and cell phone data shows they made it to McRae by Thursday evening.

Police say the phone number the Runions called traces back to a disposable cell phone, signals from which they are tracking in hopes of finding the couple.

A missing person's report has been filed with Cobb County police.

Owens and her sister, Stephanie Bishop, say the last conversation they had with their parents was one in which they had expressed excitement over the car.

They said their father had wanted the car ever since he returned from duty in Vietnam in 1966.

‘We’re just staying positive and not thinking the worst,’ Brittany Patterson, another daughter, told AJC.com.

The couple's concerned daughters have set up a Facebook page to assist with the search and to raise awareness of the couple's disappearance. To date it has been shared more than 40,000 times.
