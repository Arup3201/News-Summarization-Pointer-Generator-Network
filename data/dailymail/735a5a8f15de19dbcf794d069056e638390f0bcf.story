In honor of former President Bill Clinton's 68th birthday, the Clinton Foundation released a House of Cards spoof on Friday, featuring Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood and Hillary Clinton as herself.

In the video Underwood impersonates Bill and tries to find out what the former first lady plans to get her husband for his upcoming birthday.

In a nod toward Hillary's dodgy remarks about her presidential ambitions, the former Secretary of State tells him: 'I told you you, this is a very personal decision that I will make when I'm ready.'

Hillary shoots down Underwood's suggestion that she buy her husband an elephant for their backyard

In a phone call to Hillary, Underwood suggests that she buy Bill an elephant for the backyard of their Chappaqua, New York, home, but Clinton shoots him down.

'Don't you think that could be a little dangerous for our dogs?' she asks, referring to her and Bill's three pets.

'Well, what about a baby elephant?' Underwood responds.

Still undercover, the faux politician suggests that the Clinton's pregnant daughter, Chelsea, name her first-born child Frank - after himself - if it's a boy and Claire - after his wife - if its a girl.

'Well, I was actually thinking of pushing for the name Kevin if it's a boy,' Hillary tells him.

Hillary ends calling Underwood actor Kevin Spacey out, and he gives up

'Kevin, will you please just sign my husband's birthday card already?' Clinton says, calling Spacey out.

The final scene of the spoof shows a fake text message conversation between Spacey and Bill in which Spacey informs him that he wasn't able to find out what Hillary had in store for his birthday.

The video was published on the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation's website on Friday along with a form to sign Bill's card.

The 42 President of the United States' birthday is on Tuesday.
