It is every Antiques Roadshow fan’s dream – a painting picked up in a shop for just £400 has been identified as a Van Dyck masterpiece.

The piece, worth up to £400,000, will be revealed tonight to be the most valuable painting to feature in the show’s 36-year history.

It was identified after a hunch by  presenter Fiona Bruce when the owner of the painting, Father Jamie MacLeod, took it along to be valued at Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire.

Materpiece: Fiona Bruce with FR Jamie MacLeod with the 17th century work of art

Ms Bruce, who recently made a TV programme about Anthony van Dyck, thought it might be a genuine work  by the Flemish master and showed it to an expert. It was later confirmed  to be by the leading court painter in 17th Century England.

‘It’s everyone’s dream to spot a hidden masterpiece,’ she said. ‘I’m thrilled that my hunch paid off – to discover a genuine Van Dyck is incredibly exciting.’

The picture, showing a Brussels magistrate, is believed to be a preparatory piece for a larger work painted in 1634.

While the main painting was destroyed in 1695, the smaller single portrait survived and somehow found its way to an antiques shop in Nantwich, Cheshire.

From there it was bought for £400 by Fr MacLeod – mainly because he liked its golden frame.

It hung in the hallway of a retreat 
he runs for the clergy in Derbyshire. At at one stage, the painting fell
 off its hook on the wall and landed on a CD player, smashing the 
device.

After
 art expert Philip Mould inspected it, it underwent a thorough 
restoration and was officially verified as a genuine Van Dyck by Dr 
Christopher Brown, who is a world authority on the artist.

Mr
 Mould said: ‘Discoveries of this type are exceptionally rare. The 
painting’s emergence from beneath layers of paint was dramatic.

‘It’s
 been revealed as a thrilling example of Van Dyck’s skills of direct 
observation that made him so great a portrait painter.’

The
 artwork will now be sold by Fr MacLeod to pay for the restoration of 
bells at the chapel within the grounds of the retreat he runs.

He
 said: ‘It’s wonderful that new church bells hopefully will be pealing 
out to commemorate the centenary of the end of the First World War in 
2018.’

The discovery, to be revealed on BBC1 at 7pm tonight, makes the  portrait the most valuable painting ever found on Antiques Roadshow.

Among the show’s other most famous previous discoveries is a glass vase bought for £1 at a car boot sale.

It  was later identified as a rare Art Nouveau piece and was sold at auction for £32,450.

Tonight’s edition of Antiques Roadshow will also reveal that a leather-covered chest inscribed with the initials ‘Q’ and ‘A’ almost certainly belonged to Queen Anne.

It has been studied by experts at Hampton Court Palace, who have unearthed records suggesting the chest was used to transport Queen Anne’s bed linen when she travelled between various Royal palaces.

Experts on the show estimate it is worth up to £30,000.
