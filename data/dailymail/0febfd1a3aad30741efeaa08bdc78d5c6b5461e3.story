Matt Fitzpatrick and Graeme McDowell were among the rich assortment of players to make fulsome contributions to a wonderful first day at the 114th United States Open before Martin Kaymer emerged from the evening shadows to add a slice of Pinehurst history on Thursday.

A remarkably crowded leaderboard led by McDowell among others had formed until the brilliant German put together an intoxicating back nine that earned him a clear three stroke lead.

On the charge: Martin Kaymer stormed into a three-shot lead after a brilliant back nine

Kaymer 
completed a spectacular return from a year in the wilderness with his 
victory in the Players Championship last month. Here the good times 
continued with a stunning inward half of 31 strokes for a 65 that was 
the lowest score ever seen in nine US Open rounds at this storied North 
Carolina venue.

‘Obviously
 I took a lot of confidence from the Players victory and especially the 
way I won down the stretch,’ said Kaymer. ‘I played very well today and 
holed some good putts late on that made my score.’

Ben Hogan 
once sat in the locker room at a US Open and, shaking his head, 
proclaimed:  ‘I just played with a kid who should have beaten me by six 
shots.’

Certain
 parallels with that lovely story about a tender Jack Nicklaus might 
well have crossed Phil  Mickelson’s mind on Thursday after being 
outplayed by England’s outstanding young talent Matt Fitzpatrick in the 
opening round of the 114th edition.

In the end, the decorated American shot 70 to the Sheffield teenager’s 71, but the third member of the group, defending champion Justin Rose, who fought back valiantly for a 72 of his own, called it perfectly, saying: ‘Matt was just so impressive, he played an outstanding round of golf. The only disappointing thing for him is that he must feel he left several shots out there.’

The most 
disappointing of those came at his penultimate hole, the 8th on the 
card, when he addressed a chip and his ball moved. Fitzpatrick duly 
called in the referee to confirm he needed to add a one shot  penalty. 
Typical Matt, he didn’t bemoan his luck afterwards or rage at the gods.‘I just thought: “Oops”,’ said the 19 year old.

Day
 one at the most eagerly anticipated US Open for some years and the 
hoopla was justified as McDowell supplied the grit, Rory McIlroy 
the glamour, and some of the outstanding young talents in the game 
showed their quality and composure.

US
 Open specialist McDowell was the early leader alongside American Kevin 
Na after respective rounds of 68 but Jordan Spieth, the remarkable 
20-year-old Texan, and Japan’s 22-year-old rising son Hideki Matsuyama 
also broke par with 69s, as did world No 2 Henrik Stenson and world No 5
 Matt Kuchar.

McIlroy played quite beautifully, hitting
 14 greens in regulation and missing just one fairway, but still  
finished three shots behind playing partner, G-Mac.

Is there another
 player in the sport who  manages his game quite as expertly as 
McDowell, who won this title in 2010 and finished runner-up in 2012?

Tough challenge: Dustin Johnson hits out of the trees on the eighth hole

By
 his own admission he didn’t strike the ball very well but the only time
 he was ever out of position was on the closing hole, and he still made a
 par. McIlroy birdied it to place his round in a deservedly kinder 
light. Another contented camper was Ian Poulter, who matched the 
stringent par of 70.

Three more 70s, and he will almost certainly be collecting his first major come Sunday night.

Just why Fitzpatrick will turn pro after this tournament was evident in this exciting display.

He will need to find a little length off the tee but other than that the only missing piece is experience.

He
 gave himself any number of birdie opportunities while a couple of the 
saves he made from precarious spots were so good they were positively 
Mickelson-esque.

And so it was that a shade before 8am the most 
alluring threeball of the day made their way to the first tee. You had 
to admire Fitzpatrick’s composure as he walked down his first hole.

A
 decent number of his supporters were making themselves known and 
England’s first US Amateur Champion for more than a century acknowledged
 them all.

At the Masters there had been first tee nerves and a 
double bogey. Here he calmly pitched close to the hole and rolled the 
putt in for a birdie. Another followed at the 12th and he actually stood
 over a 6ft birdie putt at the 13th for the outright lead. It caught the
 hole, alas, and stayed out.

When he missed short putts at the next 
two as well for bogeys, there was the horrible fear his dream start was 
turning into  nightmarish reality.

Then came a welcome moment of good
 fortune as a long birdie putt at the 16th touched every millimetre of 
the hole’s circumference before falling below ground. Fitzpatrick looked
 skywards and expressed his relief by blowing out his cheeks and smiling
 broadly. By the side of the green, Mickelson caught his eye and 
acknowledged the quality of the putt.

Testing: Bubba Watson hits a shot from a bunker on the sixth hole

‘He was like that all day as 
was Justin,’ said Fitzpatrick. ‘Whenever I played a good shot they made 
sure I heard what they thought about it. It was a great experience for 
me. I know my game is currently a long way from theirs, they’re grown 
men who have won majors. But I hope to get there one day.’

Outside 
the ropes, the masses were getting excited as Mickelson showed all his 
class and short game brilliance to move into the lead  at one point, as 
he attempts to complete the fabled career grand slam. It was some effort
 by the Open champion who will turn 44 next Monday, given the mental  
burden of his past history in this event, where he has been runner-up on
 no fewer than six occasions. Two dropped shots late on, however, tinged
 the round with feelings of disappointment.

Mickelson had woken to a 
story in the New York Times admitting they had ‘overstated’ the claim he
 was being investigated for potential insider trading. ‘As I’ve said all
 along, I did nothing wrong but I’ll continue to help the investigation 
in any way that I can,’ he said.

As for Rose, just as he did last 
year when he went on to win, he fought back from a horrible start that 
saw him reach the turn in four over par.

‘I was definitely thinking 
about Merion after nine holes,’ he acknowledged. ‘My short game was 
really poor but if I can get that sharp I can really feel confident 
about the rest of the week because I’m striking the ball better than I 
have for a while.’

A crowded leaderboard, therefore, and a gorgeous 
mix of  established figures and men of promise who will undoubtedly 
leave their mark on the game in years to come.

Pinehurst is living up to the hype.
