Photographs dating back to as early as 1970 of astronauts training on a barren Hawaiian island in preparation for their historic missions to the moon were released by NASA on Saturday.

The photos show the crews of Apollo 14, 15 and 17 training on Hawaii's Big Island, a volcanic landscape which sports an environment remarkably similar to the one found on the moon. The astronauts practiced with equipment such as the moon buggy in area with recent volcanic activity, also rehearsing activities such as taking soil samples.

The earliest photograph dates back to 1970, which shows astronauts Alan Shepard, Edgard Mitchell and Stuart Roost of Apollo 14 training with a Modularized Equipment Transporter.

This image from 1970 shows Apollo 14 astronauts Alan Shepard, Edgar Mitchell, and Stuart Roost training with a Modular Equipment Transporter along with another unidentified individual. This photo was among a set recently unearthed by NASA showing astronauts training in preparation for their historic moon missions.

This photo, taken in 1971, shows Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison 'Jack' Schmitt (pictured left) training in a lunar roving vehicle on the Big Island of Hawaii. Apollo 17, which launched on December 7, 1972, was the last manned lunar mission undertaken by the United States, making this photo the latest in the set recently unearthed by NASA.

According to NASA, the photographs were found by Rob Kelso, executive director of The Pacific International Space Center for Exploration Systems, a Hawaii state agency. Kelso reportedly found the photos while visiting the Johnson Space Center, in Houston, Texas.

Kelso said that crews from Apollo missions 13 through 17 trained on the island for their lunar missions. The island is still used by NASA to test robots for missions to the moon and to Mars.

This picture, dated December 1970, shows members of the crew of Apollo 15 training with gear on. The area was picked for it's remarkable similarity to the terrain of the moon.

According to Kelso, robots are being tested on 'lava tubes', areas formed after lava solidifies and becomes a solid sheet. Formations similar to lava tubes have been found on satellite imaging of planets such as Mercury, Venus, and Mars.

In recent years, NASA has also begun to use the island to test new technology that can pull oxygen out of the area's dirt, which is volcanic basalt much like the soil commonly found on both the moon and Mars. The technology could allow future missions to simply extract oxygen from the planet's soil instead of bringing it on the trip. The technology could also be applied to make fuel for the missions.
