A Bond girl told a London court how she kicked Max Clifford, pictured, 'really hard' between the legs after he allegedly sexually assaulted her

A Bond girl told a court today how she kicked Max Clifford between the legs ‘really hard’ after he sexually assaulted her.

The woman, an extra in the James Bond film Octopussy, said the celebrity publicist had shoved her on to a sofa and thrown himself on top of her.

She said: 'He lunged towards me. He pushed me down. He was on top of me. His hands were all over the place and he was trying to kiss me. I just remember his smelly breath.

'Then I got very frightened and I kicked him between the legs really hard.  He held himself. I jumped up, grabbed my things and ran.’

The woman, now 52, said the assault came in Clifford's New Bond Street offices after he had persuaded her to wear stockings and suspenders for a photo shoot.

It was 1981 or 1982 and Clifford was offering to become her agent, she said. She had ready been given a role in the Roger Moore movie.

He promised to make her famous and said she could get her a part in a new film by legendary Hollywood actor and director Charles Bronson, but needed some photographs of her in lingerie first, Southwark Crown Court in London heard.

She told jurors she had just landed the role in Octopussy and was aged about 20. ‘Max Clifford contacted me or I was given his number and I went to his office. He congratulated me on being in Octopussy,’ she said.

‘He had a script for a new Charles Bronson film and he thought I would be perfect [for that too].'

After their meeting, she said she received a bizarre phone call at home from a man named 'Terry Denton' who claimed he worked for Clifford and told her the publicist was 'in love’ with her.

Then, at their next meeting, again in Clifford's office, she said the PR man pretended to be on the phone to Charles Bronson.

'He said he was speaking to Charles Bronson and that he needed photographic evidence from me,' she said.

Trial: The publicist stopped to pose for photographers as he arrived at Southwark Crown Court today

She claimed Clifford gave her money and sent her to a nearby Dorothy Perkins shop to buy lingerie, and she came back with a bra, a pair of knickers, a suspender belt and stockings.

She thought he would take professional photographs but instead of using a studio, he made her pose in an office while he snapped away with an 'Instamatic' camera with 'no film in it', she told the court.

'He asked me to do the "James Bond gun pose" and asked me to sit on the sofa and put my legs apart.

'I realised things weren't right at all.'

She got dressed to leave but claimed Clifford then molested her.

Asked by Richard Horwell QC, defending, if she was making her claims up, the woman said: ‘What I'm saying is, to my best knowledge, the absolute truth and anything that deviates from that as such - it's such a long time ago. And it did happen.’

Barbara Broccoli, daughter of film producer Cubby Broccoli, said that her father did not even know Clifford

The jury in the PR guru's trial is now 11-strong after one juror dropped out because she knew a witness

The court later heard from James Bond producer Barbara Broccoli, the daughter of Bond movie franchise owner Cubby Broccoli.

The court previously heard that Clifford claimed he represented Cubby Broccoli, and told one alleged victim she would have to sleep with the producer so she could be in one of his films.

But Miss Broccoli said she did not think her father knew Clifford, telling the jury: 'As far as I know he did not know him.'

Wearing a navy blazer, white shirt and jeans, Clifford listened from the dock. The 70-year-old, from Hersham in Surrey, is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven women and girls.

He denies all the charges.

The jury trying him is now 11 strong after one woman juror was discharged because she said she knew one of the supporting witnesses.
