Authorities in Miami believe there may be a link between a group who filmed a rap video bragging about murder and the recent shooting of a police officer.

Officer Lino Diaz was shot twice while executing a search warrant on a North Miami Beach house early Friday morning.

Police say the home  bears a striking resemblance to the one that was used to film a rap video for NMB Stunnaz, in which the man waved around assault rifles, dumped shell casings on the ground, and pointed guns right at the camera.

The suspected shooter, Elton Bandoo, was taken into custody Friday. It is unknown whether he is one of the men in the video.

According to the Miami Herald, Diaz was shot shortly after sunrise during an investigation with federal agents into unemployment fraud at the home.

Meanwhile, police had used the 2011 NMB Stunnaz rap video for Pull Out The Stick when preparing for the raid.

'We’re aware of that video and we used it as part of our planning,' said North Miami Beach police Major Kathy Katerman. 

'We don’t know that for sure, if one of them [in the video] is the shooter. But the structure you see in the video appears very similar.'

Officer Diaz was rushed to Jackson Memorial Hospital after being shot and is expected to make a full recovery and be released on Monday.
