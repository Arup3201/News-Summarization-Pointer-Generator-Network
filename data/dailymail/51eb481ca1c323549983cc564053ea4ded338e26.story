The illegitimate son a wealthy Spanish aristocrat has been awarded a €2million (£1.6m) inheritance in a five-year legal battle reminiscent of a Downton Abbey plot.

Esteban Marchena García, 59, was born to 17-year-old servant girl Encarnacion Marchena in 1955, after she had an affair with the late Seville-based landowner Juan Velez Utrera.

As the boy was illegitimate Utera refused to recognise him as his son, which led to his adoption and eventually to him receiving no money when his father died aged 82 in 2001.

But following a lengthy legal fight that saw his family secretly exhume Utera's body and have it cremated in order to destroy the DNA, a judge has now ruled that Marchena, who works as a waiter in Malaga, has the same right to the family fortune as his three legitimate brothers.

Illegitimate: Esteban Marchena García, 59, was born to 17-year-old servant girl Encarnacion Marchena in 1955, after she had an affair with the late Seville-based landowner Juan Velez Utrera

Marchena was born on his father's estate near Seville at a time when the law allowed wealthy aristocrats to easily disown children they had fathered outside of marriage. 

The problem was particularly prevalent in southern Spain in the mid-1950s.

As she was not receiving any additional income to look after her son, his mother was forced to give Marchena up for adoption, although the pair kept in regular contact, according to The Times.

When Utrera died in 2001 his estate was divided between his legitimate offspring. Eight years later Marchena started legal action to claim his share of the money, claiming his mother deserved justice after being forced to give up the child she loved.

In a bizarre twist early in the case, Utrera's family dug up the aristocrat's body and had it cremated before DNA tests ordered by the court could be conducted. The tests were ordered in the hope of proving Utrera was Marchena's father - something his family had long denied.

But the judge this week finally ruled in favour of Marchena and awarded him $2million - claiming the 'extraordinary obstruction' of his three brothers and the family likeness was enough to prove Utrera had been his biological father.

Marchena is not the only illegitimate Spanish waiter to launch a high-profile court case arguing his right to an aristocratic inheritance. Alberto Sola (left) claims he is the son of Spain's former King Juan Carlos (right)

The case came to court after Spain changed its inheritance laws in 2006, allowing women and children born outside marriages the same right to inherit family fortunes as their legitimate siblings.

Since then dozens of high profile cases have emerged where the first-born daughters of aristocrats and politicians have been granted wealth and titles they wouldn't have received under the old law.

Bizarrely Marchena is not the only illegitimate Spanish waiter to launch a high-profile court case arguing his right to a large inheritance from his aristocratic father.

Alberto Sola, 58, whose adoptive parents are peasants from Catalonia, claims he is the illegitimate son of Spain's former King Juan Carlos - the monarch who abdicated the throne in July and allegedly bedded more than 1,500 women.

In August - after the former king lost his  immunity by quitting quit the throne - Sola lodged his claim in the country's highest court in a bid to finally prove he is of royal blood.
