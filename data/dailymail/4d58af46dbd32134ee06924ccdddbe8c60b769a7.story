A group of cute mini-mes starring in an Emmy parody clip have managed to almost upstage their A-list counterparts and attract over half a million YouTube hits .

The adorable video, created by parenting site Mom.me, features a cast of children as characters including Detective Rust Cohle, played by Matthew McCounaghy in True Detectives,  Walter White from Breaking Bad played best-actor winner Bryan Cranston  and Michelle Dockery's Downtown Abbey alter ego, Lady Mary.

It also includes scenes from Emmy-nominated shows including Game of Thrones, House of Cards and Mad Men.

Starring in the YouTube hit are mini Lady Mary (pictured right) and mini Anna (pictured left with Lady Mary) from Downtown Abbey

Bryan Cranston may have won the Emmy for his role as Walter White in Breaking Bad but his miniature counterpart also gives a stirring performance

In the opening scene a group of children in Game of Thrones garb declare they are the 'the true king' only to be set on fire by a stuffed dragon at the request of a mini Queen Daenerys. 

A little Detective Rust Cohle sporting a fake moustache then gets philosophical across his desk, much to the bemusement of a teeny Detective Maynard Gilbough.

And in a quirky parody of Kevin Spacey's performance in House of Cards, a pint-sized Frank Underwood talks to the camera from the Oval Office.

Game of Thrones also appears on the YouTube clip

Also given the kiddy treatment is Jon Hamm's Mad Men character Don Draper, who raises a laugh across the boardroom table by making a sexist remark at the expense of a mini Peggy.

'I spent all night working on that pitch!' declares the miffed Peggy before storming off.

But perhaps the best laugh of the clip comes in a scene from Downtown Abbey when Anna pours her heart out to Lady Mary.

'I know how you feel. My dress has stain, afternoon tea was late and I don't know which wealthy man to marry!' sighs Lady Mary's tiny doppelganger.

And emulating Bryan Cranston's Emmy-winning role, the pint-sized Walter White also gives a brilliant performance. 'This is the last time I trust my chemistry teacher!' he declares dryly.

Award-winning performances all round!
