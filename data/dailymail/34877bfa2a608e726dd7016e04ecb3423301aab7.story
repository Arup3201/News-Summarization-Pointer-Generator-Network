Traditional religious freedoms are under assault from the ‘intolerance of aggressive secularism’, a Cabinet minister will warn today.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles will today attack court rulings against the right of Christians to wear crosses at work and legal action to prevent prayers before council meetings.

He will insist that faith provides a ‘clear moral compass’ for society and declare that the Coalition does ‘do God’, unlike the last Labour government.

Warning: Eric Pickles will say religious freedoms are under assault from the 'intolerance of aggressive secularism'

Mr Pickles’s comments come on the day of a crunch verdict from the European Court of Human Rights, which will rule whether four Christians were discriminated against at work – including two women who claim they were forced out of their jobs for wearing the cross.

He is vowing to change UK law to support the right of people to discreetly display a symbol of faith in their workplace if their case is rejected.

Addressing the think-tanks British Future and Policy Exchange in London, Mr Pickles will say: ‘Faith provides a clear moral compass and a call to action that benefits society as a whole. At a time when Christians are under attack for their beliefs in different parts of the world, I am proud of the freedom of belief that exists in Britain.

‘But in recent years long-standing British liberties of freedom of religion have been undermined by the intolerance of aggressive secularism: taking people to task for wearing a cross or a rosary, beginning costly legal actions against council prayers – as if they had nothing better to do.

Symbol of faith: Eric Pickles is vowing to change UK law to support the right of people to discreetly display a symbol of faith in their workplace

‘We’re committed to the right of Christians and people of all beliefs to follow their faith openly, wear religious symbols and pray in public.’

Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali, the former bishop of Rochester, said that it would be ‘clear discrimination’ to allow employers to ban the cross whilst letting those of other faiths wear symbols and clothing from their religions.

He added that it would ‘further accelerate the undermining of this country’s Judeo-Christian foundations by aggressive secularism and naive multi-culturalism’.

In his speech, Mr Pickles will also reiterate previous demands that all immigrants should learn English, saying it is ‘incomprehensible’ that no one speaks the language in one in 20 households. Parents who do not ensure their children learn English are ‘condemning them to a limited life’, he will say.

He will attack the ‘old statist policies’ such as the decision to pay for translation ‘instead of trusting people to learn the language’.

‘People should be able to talk to and understand one and another in a nuanced way. The reality is you need English to succeed. We all miss out, our country is the poorer, if people can’t speak our language, if they are unable to participate or make an economic contribution.

‘English is the passport to prosperity the world over. From Mumbai through to Beijing every striving parent is trying to get their kids to learn English,’ he will add.

Eric Pickles: Not confident in estimates

David Cameron yesterday explained why the Government is refusing to publish official estimates of how many Romanians and Bulgarians will come to the UK to seek work when restrictions are lifted at the end of the year.

He confirmed that figures had been drawn up by civil servants but said he had little confidence his officials had come up with reliable numbers.

The Prime Minister said the Coalition wants to avoid mistakes made by Labour in 2004. Then, there were confident predictions that only a few thousand Poles would come to Britain for work when they joined the EU.

In the event, the number of Polish migrants turned out to be far higher – and the hundreds of thousands of new arrivals put huge pressure on housing and public services.

Some 21million Romanians and 7million Bulgarians will be free to travel to and work in Britain from the end of the year when transitional controls on EU migrants expire.

At the weekend, Eric Pickles revealed he had seen estimates of how many might come to the UK but said he would not yet release them because he was not ‘confident’ that the figures were accurate.

In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Cameron backed Mr Pickles’s decision not to publish the estimates. He said civil service figures had proved unreliable in the past.

He added: ‘If you look at what the calculation was in the case of Poland, it was something like 14,000 – a ridiculously low number – and it turned out to be many, many times that. So we don’t want to make that mistake again so it’s right to take the time and get this right.’ But Mr Cameron said he did not believe as many Bulgarians and Romanians would come over as Poles did almost a decade ago. He added: ‘The last government didn’t put in place any transitional controls – we told them to.

‘You can basically restrict the immigration for the first seven years and they failed to do that, and quite rightly we have had transitional  controls in place with Romania and Bulgaria.’A source close to Mr Pickles yesterday said: ‘When we get the answers, we will make a  judgment [on the figures].’
