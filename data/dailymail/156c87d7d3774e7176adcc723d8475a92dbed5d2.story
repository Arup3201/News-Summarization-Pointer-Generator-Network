Britons are going to greater lengths than ever to impress on a first date, by splashing out an average of £90 on grooming beforehand.

Preparation includes haircuts, manicures and spray tans - and £42 on a new outfit.

The cost doesn't stop once they're out the door, with singletons spending an average of £50 on food and drink during a hot date.

Men spend 10 per cent more cash on pre-first date grooming - including manicures and haircuts

While women have a reputation for spending hours in front of the mirror, men are now outdoing the ladies, according to this research.

The average man spends £93 on grooming to make the best first impression, compared to £83 for women.

A haircut is deemed an essential, with men spending an average of £18 on a pre-date trim, as well as a further £75 on other grooming treatments, including spray tans.

While £132 is the national average spend
 on grooming and outfits, Coventry residents splash the most cash to 
impress a potential suitor, spending £204 on pre-date 
preparations, followed by Birmingham, who spend £200, and Londoners who splash a hefty £191.

Gloucester residents spend the least with just £83 while the Welsh also 
take a less pampered approach, with Wrexham dwellers spending just £92 
and Cardiff citizens, £95.

Many date up to four people at once, but are quick to spot a catch, bagging a partner in less than three dates

And the first 
date splurging habit could prove expensive for the UK's singletons, as 
those surveyed admitted that in their luckiest months they dated an 
average of three different people.

A third (33 per cent) confessed to 
dating over four different suitors (one a week!).

Despite
 this trend for serial dating, Brits are quick to spot a catch, with 
over half (52 per cent) of those surveyed having started a relationship 
with their current partner within three dates or less.

Forget old fashioned courtship, the digital era has well and truly taken over as technology is the top way to score a date, making that first face-to-face impression more crucial than ever.

Nearly two fifths of respondents (37 per cent) admit dating sites, apps or social sites are now their top way to find love, with over one in 10 (12 per cent) using dating apps.

Just over one in five Brits still hope to meet a match through friends (22 per cent) while the office romance is on the way out with only four per cent looking for love at work. 

A swipe to the right is key to dating success as 60 per cent of those in a new relationship found their new partner on Tinder.

While women have a reputation for spending hours in front of the mirror, men are outdoing the ladies

Looking for love online is also a proven winner, with 55 per cent of new couples finding each other on a dating site.

This is followed by a further 46 per cent through another dating app, 37 per cent through blind dates and 30 per cent on Facebook.

Just 21 per cent found love on a speed date, despite busy speed daters going on an average of seven dates a month - the most of any method.

A spokesperson for VoucherCodes.co.uk, who commissioned the research, said: 'It seems Britons have a serious case of first date butterflies, spending nearly £150 on their appearance to make the ultimate first impression.

'With technology giving singletons access to more potential partners than ever before, dating is an exciting experience but could prove an expensive habit.'

As technology is the top way to score a date, that first face-to-face impression more crucial than ever
