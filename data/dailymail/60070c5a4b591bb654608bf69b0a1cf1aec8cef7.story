She's been dubbed Australia's Katniss Everdeen - and Christie Pisani says she would 'kick a***' at the Hunger Games.

The 30-year-old paramedic, personal trainer and bow-hunter was born in Western Sydney into a 'hunting family' and estimates that she first shot a rifle at the age of four.

Ms Pisani switched to bow-hunting at the age of 20 and estimates that she has killed more than 40 different species of animals, including pigs, goats, deer, and buffalo, warthog and wildebeest.

Her first kill was a goat, which she cooked on camp oven for dinner and her most terrifying moment came when she was charged by a buffalo in the Northern Territory.

The Goondiwindi local, who writes a column, Babes And Bows, for Bowhunting Downunder magazine, is a passionate advocate of hunting and thinks more women should be involved in the sport.

'I think women bring a softer edge to the sport… We're quite in touch with the idea of ethical hunting – only taking what you need, not letting things suffer more than they need to,' she said.

She says that while the sport attracts criticism, most of that is down to ignorance and that hunters are often quite environmentally conscious.

Ms Pisani is currently a semi-finalist in the Extreme Huntress competition, if she makes it to the top six, she will travel to Texas in July to film the finals

Ms Pisani started hunting at the age of four and says the sport is 'family-friendly' and misunderstood by critics who think it is cruel

She says that more women should get into hunting, because they bring an 'ethical' side to the sport

'Hunters are the ones who are out there in the bush and it's in our interest to protect the bush,' she said.

'People are always opposed to what they don't understand. People forget where their meat comes from.

'Hunters generally, except for a handful of bad apples, do respect the animals and don't want to see them suffer more than is necessary.'

Ms Pisani is one of 20 semi-finalists in the U.S. Extreme Huntress contest, a U.S. television hunting competition, if she makes it to the top six she will fly to Texas in July to film the television show.

The show's tagline is: 'If mom goes hunting so will her children', and Ms Pisani agrees that hunting is a family-friendly sport.

Ms Pisani met her husband Luke through the sport, he runs bow-hunting tours

Ms Pisano's dream is to bag an American bison, which she hopes to do if she makes it to the finals of the Extreme Huntress competition this year

It has proved to be a romantic sport for her as well, it was through hunting that Ms Pisani met her husband Luke, who leads bow-hunting tours and she says that if the pair have children they will definitely raise them to be hunters.

'I owe a lot to my dad who provided this awesome childhood where you could just go out and go hunting whenever we wanted and he passed that passion on to us, it'd be a great thing to pass on to the next generation,' she said.

In the short term though, she is hoping to make it to the Extreme Huntress finals, and bag an American bison.

Christie says that success in hunting depends on persistence, patience, attention to detail and compassion for the animal

Christie has hunted in Australia and also in Namibia, where she was able to hunt wildebeest and warthog, but her most terrifying encounter was with a water buffalo in the Northern Territory
