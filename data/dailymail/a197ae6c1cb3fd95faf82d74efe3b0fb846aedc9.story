The pregnant 'body-in-suitcase' murder suspect Heather Mack told her lawyer 'I don't know how long I can take this' as it emerged she was put in solitary confinement in an Indonesian jail, her lawyer said on Monday.

The 19-year-old's Chicago attorney told MailOnline he spoke to Mack for the first time in several days shortly after midnight today.

'She has gotten worse in terms of her emotional and mental state,' he said. 'On the one hand, the fact she is now in isolation with a female guard is healthy, but on the other she is very scared by what is going on.

'She is emotionally and mentally drained, and told me, "I don't know how long I can take this"'. I would like to be there because she needs a friendly face, somebody she can trust.'

Heather and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, were arrested in Bali on August 12 for the murder of her mother, wealthy widow Sheila von Wiese Mack, 62. 

The butchered, half-naked body was discovered inside a suitcase that Heather and Schaefer had allegedly taken from the luxury St. Regis hotel down to a taxi, saying they would return.

After two hours, the driver began to get suspicious when blood started to seep from the case and he went to the police station where the grisly discovery was made.

The young lovers, who both come from the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, were arrested, asleep in each other's arms in a hotel near the Bali international airport, after allegedly attempting to get hotel staff to open her mother's safe deposit box so they could retrieve their passports.

Heather is two months pregnant with what is believed to be Schaefer's child. Indonesian authorities say if she is convicted, the child could grow up in prison with her mother. 

Elkin said he has appointed a local Indonesian attorney to take the case and has aides on the island doing investigative work to help in her defence. Neither Heather nor Schaefer have yet been charged.

He said he has scrapped immediate plans to go to Bali because sources on the ground there have told him that he could be detained himself because of allegations he made that Heather had been sexually assaulted while in prison.

'It was completely my intention to go,' he said. 'But when my sources started telling me the authorities had the intention of detaining me I changed my mind. It is not that I am concerned for my physical safety more the logistical issues that would arise if I was detained.

'It would create tremendous problems because I am the only one with full details of everything that is going on.'

Last week Elkin made his claims that Heather had been sexually assaulted 'multiple times' inside her jail. He said she initially thought it was fellow inmates but later changed her mind saying not all the guards wear uniform.

The lawyer admitted he had to be circumspect when asking her what had happened because of fears their conversation was being monitored.

Fights: Police in Mack's hometown of Oak Park had been called to the family's former home 86 times over a ten-year period - an average of once every six weeks - to help calm fights between Mrs Mack and her daughter

'I asked her if she was being mistreated and she said yes,' he told MailOnline at the time. 'I started going through questions and asked her if she had been touched inappropriately and she said yes. I asked her if it was in the female area and she said yes. I asked her if it was on more than one occasion and she said yes.

'I asked her if it was consensual and she said no. I could not go into the specifics of whether there was an actual rape or whether it was sexual assault, molesting, call it what you will. I cannot say for sure it was intercourse.'

After those allegations Heather was placed on suicide watch and in solitary confinement with a regular female guard.

Mrs Mack's body was found in the morning of August 12. She had been hit repeatedly about the face with a heavy blunt object. Pathologists say she suffered asphyxiation, a broken neck and a broken nose and that she had probably been killed between 6.45am and 10am local time.

During her autopsy, several defensive wounds were also discovered — suggesting Mrs. Mack, the widow of Chicago musician James L. Mack, who died in front of Heather during a family vacation to Greece in 2006 — had fought back while being attacked.

Dr Dudut Rustyadi, the forensic chief at Sanglah hospital morgue in the Balinese capital of Denpasar, said: 'From the wound, we found violence using blunt objects.

'We found many wounds, open wounds and bruises, including wounds on her left arm. We allege that the victim fought.'

In the hours leading up to her murder, Mrs Mack had been seen on CCTV footage walking around the hotel lobby at 3.45am.

Authorities say one sequence caught on hotel security cameras shows Mrs Mack arguing with her daughter and Schaefer about who should pay the hotel bill.

She was heard by staff telling her daughter that she had paid for Schaefer’s air fare to Bali so the two of them should pay the bill.

Police claim the young couple initially told them that they been taken captive at the St. Regis by an armed gang who killed Mrs Mack. They said they managed to escape the gang’s clutches and fled to the hotel in the Kuta area of Bali.

Mrs. Mack's body was flown back to the United States last week.

After the murder, police in her hometown of Oak Park revealed that they had been called to the family's former home 86 times over a ten-year period — an average of once every six weeks — to help calm fights between Mrs Mack and her daughter.

They never made an arrest in all of those visits even though Mrs Mack was found with a broken arm on one occasion in 2011.

It was also revealed that Mrs Mack called cops just last month after her credit card company told her about an unauthorized charge. Police went to the Conrad Hotel in downtown Chicago, where they found Tommy, Heather and seven other youngsters partying in an eighth-floor suite. Schaefer was arrested and was due to appear in court in September on charges related to the incident.

Mrs. Mack's brother, William Wiese told the Chicago Tribune that Heather grew more difficult after her father's death, which the family alleged resulted from an injury he suffered on an earlier cruise in 2006. Mrs. Mack won a $1.5 million settlement from Royal Caribbean Cruises.

Wiese told the Tribune he believed Schaefer showed up in Bali without his sister's knowledge as she was trying to make a fresh start with her daughter by taking her on the vacation. 'She was such an optimist,' he said. 'She was forever trying to help that girl.'

'I think my sister loved Heather more than anything,' Wiese added. 'She would seek our input and advice. She tried so hard to help Heather through the years with therapists and psychiatrists. It was always a struggle to get Heather to (cooperate).'

Mrs Mack sold the five-bed, five-bath Oak Park mansion to a developer for $650,000 last year. After extensive renovations it is now back on the market for $1.68 million. 

At the time of her death, she and her daughter were living in a 18th-floor luxury apartment on Chicago's Gold Coast area with stunning views overlooking Lake Michigan.
