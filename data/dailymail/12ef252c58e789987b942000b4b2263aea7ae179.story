A pensioner has been forced to reassure friends and family that he is alive and well after a local newspaper published his obituary.

The Northern Echo ran a dedication to George Simpson on Thursday paying tribute to his 'friendly' nature and community work.

But when mourners rang to pay their respects to Mr Simpson's family, they were surprised to hear him answer the phone.

The confusion arose when the 
newspaper was told a man named George Simpson, of Darlington, died 
earlier this month and his funeral was due to take place this afternoon.

George Simpson said he was able to see the funny side after his obituary was published in a local newspaper

It then ran the 
obituary to Mr Simpson, 81, of Darlington, County Durham, along with a photograph, when in fact 
it was an 84-year-old namesake who had died.

Mr
Simpson is well known in the town for his involvement in local football
and the article included a tribute from a referee.

His wife Sandra, 67, answered some of the phone calls to inform friends that her husband was not deceased.

Mr Simpson said: 'I'm still alive. The phone hasn't stopped all morning, I've had to go out to get away from it.

'My cousin read it and he informed his two
sisters in Australia that I'd died, but now he knows I'm still here so 
he's getting back in contact with them to give them the news.

'It's been a terrible mix up. The obituary in the paper says I'm 85, but I'm 81. I'm ageing every day.

'The man who died was aged 84 I believe. I can take it and I see the funny side. People have said I'm the best looking corpse they've seen.

'But I do feel sorry for the family of George Simpson who has died. I don't know them but he lives on the other side of town.

'I'm a bit worried that people who know me will turn up at the funeral.

'The paper has apologised and are going to print something to clear everything up.'

The Northern Echo mistakenly ran an obituary to the wrong George Simpson in Thursday's newspaper

Mr Simpson, a former Royal Navy electrician, won an 'Unsung Hero' award for his dedication to local football in 2011.

The obituary detailed Mr Simpson's involvement in the Darlington Church and Friendly League over 45 years.

He had chronicled results from the league, taking up responsibility for the register which was 106 years old. The league folded in 2010.

The obituary read: 'George Simpson, the very definition of the Darlington Church and Friendly League and its unceasing mainstay for 45 years has died. He was 85.

'Friendly? Beyond question. Christian? George was such a good-hearted chap that he wouldn't even include goal difference in the league tables he sent to the papers.

'"It disheartens those who concede a lot," he said.'

The MailOnline has contacted The Northern Echo for comment.
