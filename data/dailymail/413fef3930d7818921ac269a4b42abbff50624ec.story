It seems like hipsters are here to stay with the bearded, kale-munching, green juice-drinking members of society creating their own non-conforming offspring.

As hipsters breed, it is only fitting that they choose ironic names, inspired by music, art, geographical locations and nature – or sometimes just random letters of the alphabet.

When Gwyneth Paltrow announced to the world that her children were named ‘Apple’ and ‘Moses’ the names were considered abnormal.

But the kindergarten classes of 2020 are likely to be filled with children with monikers inspired by fruit.

They’re the names that make you feel like you haven’t applied nearly enough wit or innovation in the naming of your own children.

Beard-twirling, kale juice-drinking hipsters seem to be taking over the baby name game

Here is a list of the names that are most likely to be attached to the cardigan-wearing, thrift-store shopping bubs.

Bear, according to Buzzfeed, has frequently been used as a name by celebrities, shared by the sons of both Alicia Silverstone and Kate Winslet.

One would think that the prominence of the name amongst celebrities would make it strictly off bounds amongst hipsters.

Despite this, it is indeed a favourite name amongst the glasses-wearing, bike-pedalling members of society – especially if it is the ‘spirit animal’ of the parent.

Often, the secret to a hipster name is taking a name that is intended for one gender and giving it to a child that is of the other sex. 

Embracing all things vintage is an important component when naming a hipster child. For girls, names like Edna, Mabel, Edie and Ramona are climbing the hipster charts.

There are bouncing baby boys boasting the names Ray, Stanley and Ignatius. 

But remember – these names cannot hit the top 100 baby names. As soon as they do, they are no longer original, thus cannot be used for a truly hipster baby. 

Should we named it Edna, Mabel, Edie or Ramona?

Ray? Stanley? Ignatius? He'll probably ride a fixie and work as a barista

Names normally used for objects, with Clementine and Pearl frequently used for little girls.

Plant and food names are also particularly popular, such as Clover, Juniper, Magnolia and Olive.

Amazingly, Kale is even more multipurpose than first thought.

It is not just a hipster superfood, used frequently in salads and juices, but is also understood to be a boy’s name

Names that appear to be nicknames, such as Frankie, Lulu are also markers of true hipster names.

For hipsters naming their babies it is an opportunity to demonstrated just how cultured and well-read they are.

Classic novels are the birthplace of many hipster names. Of course, the books that are used cannot be mainstream favourites, but rather the long-forgotten treasures.

The beloved 1960 novel ‘To Kill A Mockingbird’ by Harper Lee has inspired two of the favourite names amongst the hipster community: Atticus and Scout.

Gulliver is another hipster pick, naturally spurred from the 1726 text ‘Gulliver’s Travels.

Atticus, Scout and Gulliver are among the literary-inspired hipster name choices

Holden and Salinger are two names that should be expected in future schoolyards, both derived from ‘Catcher in the Rye’ – Holden being a character in the novel and Sallnger the surname of the author, J.D. Salinger.

If the name begins with an X, Q or Z it is preferable, as they are highly uncommon – which remember, is the goal when naming a hipster child. These names include Xena, Zola, Zeus

Many of the character names from The Simpsons are becoming popular are they now hold a certain irony – so expect to see more people bearing the names Homer, Mo, Maggie and Lenny.

Just because hipsters are becoming parents, doesn’t mean they’re not cool. To remind the world of this fact, many children’s names have been inspired by the names of old-school rock stars.

The name Elvis is having a resurgence, as is Jagger – a la Mick.

Buddy is a nod to Buddy Holly and Everly is used for both baby boys and girls, perhaps in reference to the Everly Brothers.

Naming children after geographic locations is a special way for hipsters to commemorate memories - with good times obviously frequently occuring at places such as Arizona, Aspen, India and Brooklyn, which are increasing in popularity. 

Considering the number of hipster's residing in Sydney however, one can expect Tamarama or Glebe to soon be inked on baby certificates.  

Some names channel the kind of personality the parents want for their child. 

Some hipster parents are optimistic, choosing names like Serenity. 

Others are more daring, gifting their future ratbag with the name Rebel or Truant.
