He has been to war zones, flown helicopters and been known to enjoy a late night party.

But to one family in Chile, Prince Harry will always be known as the man who fixed their telly.

On a visit to a slum outside the former capital, Valparaiso, the Prince showed his practical side by mending the family’s television just in time for them to watch the Brazil v Chile match in the World Cup.

Prince Harry is shown the devastation left by forest fires in Valpariso, which burned down many homes in the poorest area of the Chilean city

Prince Harry joked and laughed with well-wishers who turned out to greet him when he visited a fire station in Valparaiso, Chile today

Crowds gathered outside the fire station in the west of the country to greet the prince, who was clearly delighted with the reception he received

The Prince was in the village of El Vergel, one of the many slums that cling to the hillsides overlooking the city, to see how the community is being rebuilt following a forest fire in April that destroyed nine in ten of the self-made homes.

The charity Techo is helping the villagers to build new homes out of chipboard and corrugated iron, and inside one of the shacks, home to Coca Perez, 50, and her teenaged son and daughter, the Prince noticed their television was not working properly.

'He looked at it and he started to fiddle with the cable,' said Mrs Perez. 'He managed to get it working so we could watch Chile playing Brazil later. Now I can tell everyone that Prince Harry is my TV repair man!'

Outside, the Prince looked at the thousands of blackened tree stumps on the sides of a valley that runs beside the slum, and was told that Techo had reinstated electricity, installed portable toilets and communal water tanks so the villagers have access sanitation.

He told Mrs Perez: 'The worst seems to be over and now it’s just a case of waiting.'  

During his visit to the fire station Harry met with firefighters, who were also laughing along with the prince

Harry was introduced to firefighters from the 11th Fire Company, which included British volunteers

The Prince looks pleased with his brand new hat in the shape of a beer tankard, but stopped short of trying it on for size after being presented with it

Mrs Perez replied: 'We just have to wait and be patient. We have no choice.'

The Prince was shown around the slum by Pia Mundaca, 24, the social director of Techo, who explained that 10,000 people had been affected by the fire, including 20 per cent of all those living in slums. A total of 15 people were killed, though none died in El Vergel.

In the first house the Prince visited, Carolina Guzman, 33, became emotional and wiped away tears as she recounted the day the fire swept through her community.

She chatted with the Prince for 10 minutes in her cramped two room home with her son Gerald Perez, aged seven.

She said: 'My husband was on another hill and I phone him and said should I leave but he said 'no don't worry the fire is on the other side’." But the flames arrived at the settlement and she had to shout for help to move her father-in-law who is bed-ridden.

'I yelled and four of my neighbours came to help move him out. When my husband arrived our home was burning and he tried to put out the flames on our son's bed but we had to leave.

'I feel really moved to have met Harry and thankful and happy. I feel like crying.'

The Prince then went to the home of Adriana Jimenez Castillo, 58, who lives with her husband and 18-year-old granddaughter. Because the hut is so much smaller than their original home, just 15ft x 12ft, it is crammed full of possessions donated to them by local charities.

Mrs Castillo told the Prince: 'We lost everything in the fire. All we could save was the dog and a handbag with our identity papers in it.

'I had saved up 2.5 million pesos (£2,500) to buy new living room and kitchen furniture, and I lost it all in the fire.'

The Prince asked: 'If the government built new houses somewhere else, would you move?' She replied: 'No, because this is my home, I have lived here for 38 years. Even if they built me a palace I wouldn’t want to move.'

Earlier in the day, Prince Harry didn't disappoint the crowds who came to see him on a trip to a fire station in the city of Valparaiso.

Last night, Prince Harry gave a speech at a Queen's Birthday Party event at the British ambassador to Chile's residence in the capital Santiago

The prince mingled with the various guests invited to the party, taking time to chat to them. He even had a joke, left, with members of the Chilean military

There he met firefighters at Valparaiso fire station, who were involved with dealing with devastating forest fires.

And crowds gathered outside the station in the west of the country to greet the prince, who was clearly delighted with the reception he received.

Harry appeared to be relaxed as he joked with the well-wishers who turned out catch a glimpse of the prince as he shook hands with many of them.

He even bent down to shake hands with children through the safety barriers who were at the front of the crowd.

The prince was also presented with his very own beer-shaped hat in the traditional red, white and blue colours of Chile and looked to be happy with his new gift.

Harry was then introduced to firefighters from the 11th Fire Company, which included British volunteers as well as representatives from the city's other fire services and members of the British community in Valparaiso.

His visit to Valparaiso comes after he attended a Queen's Birthday Party in Santiago last night hosted by the British ambassador to Chile at her residence.

During his speech, Harry joked that he would be speaking in English, as his Spanish wasn't so good and wished Chile well for their World Cup last-16 match against Brazil today.

On his arrival at the party, the Prince met with Chilean fireman. He even took time out to inspect one firefighters medals that were pinned to his chest
