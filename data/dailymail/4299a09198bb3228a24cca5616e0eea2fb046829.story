Ravi Bopara looks set to pay the price for his dismal form building up to the World Cup by being dropped from Saturday's big opening match against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

England look certain to spring a surprise by preferring Gary Ballance, who returned with a half-century in the final warm-up match against Pakistan after breaking a finger, to the under-performing Essex all-rounder.

It is a huge blow to Bopara, who has rarely lived up to his vast potential and could now be facing the end of his England career at 29.

Bopara's fate comes as good news for Gary Ballance, who appears set for a starting role at the MCG

England seemed prepared to give him the opening couple of World Cup matches after struggling in the Tri-series but all the indications were that they had made a decisive call to go with the adopted Yorkshireman.

Ballance has been one of the success stories of England's new era in Test cricket and averages over 50 in List A cricket for his county and it has seemed only a matter of time before he got his big one-day chance.

And it has come a little earlier than expected because England have finally run out of patience with a man who once scored three centuries in successive Test innings but who has become an under-achieving figure with the bat and a rarely used one with the ball.
