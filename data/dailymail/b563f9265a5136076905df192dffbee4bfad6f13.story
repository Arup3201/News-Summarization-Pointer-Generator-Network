As of tonight, book worms can download the 10,000 word chapter, which costs 99p and follows the sex lives of two twenty-somethings, to read on their morning commute.

Speaking to the Sunday Times, a spokesperson for Hodder & Stoughton, who are publishing the book, said: 'It is aimed at commuters who want to spice up their journey to work, but also it's erotic fiction that readers can actually imagine happening.'

Cheltenham-born Dubberley, 40, who is also the founding editor of Scarlet, a sex magazine for women, as well as erotica website, Cliterati, said: 'My book is aimed at females, but some men might want to improve their techniques.

'This is not the fantasy sex of Fifty Shades Of Grey but the sort of sex and relationship which most can relate to. This is not whips and chains.'

In its synopsis, Blue Mondays, a three-part series, describes itself as: 'Part one of an addictive eight-part erotic romance for fans of Sadie Matthews and Sylvia Day.

'When Lucy Green sees a stranger drop his wallet on the tube, it’s the beginning of a cat-and-mouse relationship that enlightens, frustrates and arouses her in equal measure. She follows him to give it back, and is soon drawn into a situation she never dreamed possible, behaving in a way she never thought she would.

'She seems to respond to Ben at some animal level, and it’s frightening. Should she follow her head, say goodbye and carry on her way to work? Or go with him and explore her adventurous side?

'Sensual and romantic, shocking and arousing, Blue Mondays will change the way you think about your commute forever.'
