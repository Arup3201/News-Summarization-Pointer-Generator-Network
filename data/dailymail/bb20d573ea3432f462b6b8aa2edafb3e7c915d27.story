Disturbing footage has emerged of young children in prams watching their drug addicted parents shoot up next to them in public parks.

The drug users were captured on hidden cameras set up by council workers at busy parks in Frankston, south east of Melbourne.

A woman was caught on camera pushing two young children in a pram as she approached two men in a corner of a public park.

A woman was caught on a hidden camera injecting drugs into her arm in front of two young children in a pram at a public park in Frankston, south east of Melbourne

The mother handed two men something from her bag and they were captured subsequently crouching down preparing a needle.

She turned her back on the men and started injecting the needle into her arm in broad daylight.

The footage, aired by A Current Affair on Thursday, then showed the woman folding up a tiny pink cardigan and putting it in the pram like nothing had happened.

Another incident captured a man in a nearby park clearly injecting himself in the arm.

He was caught looking around before pulling up his sleeve and shooting up.

His daughter, who appeared to be no older than 18 months, was sitting in a pram right next to him sucking on a dummy, oblivious to what was happening.

The footage had only previously been shown to members of Victorian Parliament but Frankston Mayor, Darryl Taylor, has now aired the videos publically claiming a lack of support from government and police.

'We've had a very hard fight in convincing not only government but police that there is a problem. That's why council undertook its own covert operation and collected footage,' Mr Taylor told A Current Affair.

Mr Taylor commissioned the council to set up the cameras, which captured more than 30 hours of incriminating CCTV video.

'The footage that we collected showed drug use within 100m of the current needle exchange and the police station,' Mr Taylor said.

The Mayor said Frankston's 'honey pot' drug culture was thriving because not enough was being done by the government or police to regulate pharmacies that can supply methadone.

'You don't need six located within several hundred square metres of each other,' Mr Taylor said.
