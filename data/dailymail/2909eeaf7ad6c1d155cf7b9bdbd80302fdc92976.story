Taxpayers are forking out more than £25,000 so that two dangerous inmates can have sex swap operations.

The criminals, who are at high-security Full Sutton Prison, told officials they wanted to become women courtesy of free treatment on the NHS.

Under Labour’s Gender Recognition Act, the Ministry of Justice had no option but to agree.’

Controversial: The two men are in Full Sutton Prison, which has admitted staff are being given extra training to 'support' them through the sex change process

The inmates – whose identities are being kept secret – have now begun a treatment programme.

Once complete, they will be switched to a women’s jail to reflect their change of gender.

Staff have been trained to support the convicts as they go through the process, which costs £13,500 each.

Last night, Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, expressed shock that the surgery was going ahead at a time of budget cuts.

He said: ‘Expensive treatment on the 
NHS must be based on medical need, especially with the increasing care 
demands placed on the Health Service. Part of prison involves removal of
a criminal’s liberty.

‘Many people will find it surprising 
that these changes have been given the go-ahead given the huge, and 
expensive, complications it will create.’

Details of the operations emerged in 
the 2012 report by the Independent Monitoring Board for the 600-inmate 
Category A and B prison – which holds terrorists and killers.

It said the pair had ‘exercised their legal right of choice and requested the right to start on the path of changing gender’.

Inmate: Serial killer Dennis Nilsen, who murdered 15, is currently at Full Sutton

The report adds: ‘Staff have received training and necessary arrangements have been put in place to support the prisoners.’

It comes at a time when the governor 
at the jail has to find £1.1million in savings between 2013 and 2014. 
Inmates at Full Sutton, in East Yorkshire, include Dennis Nilson, who 
murdered 15 men before dissecting their bodies, and Jeremy Bamber, who 
killed his father, mother, sister and her six-year-old twins.

This is not the first case of 
dangerous prisoners being granted sex change procedures on the taxpayer.
In 2011 it emerged that killer Robert Page was being called Emma, had 
developed breasts after £200-a-month hormone treatment, wore a blonde 
wig and was allowed to dress in skirts and blouses in the male Category A
jail HMP Wakefield.

He is serving a life sentence for 
killing Clive White, 56, during a bungled burglary and will be 
transferred to nearby female prison HMP Newhall when the gender 
reassignment surgery is complete.

There has also been controversy over 
the rights of prisoners to obtain other expensive treatments courtesy of
the taxpayer – including IVF to father children from behind bars. The 
European Court of Human Rights has ruled blocking prisoners’ access to 
IVF treatment may breach their right to a ‘private and family life’.

Since a 2007 case involving a British 
killer, 13 inmates have demanded the right to father children, citing 
the decision. In 2011, one application was approved by then prisons 
minister Crispin Blunt. But Justice Secretary Chris Grayling last month 
vowed to review the policy with a view to a ban – putting him on a 
collision course with Europe.

A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘We 
do not comment on individual prisoners. Prison staff are required to 
manage transgendered prisoners in accordance with the law.
