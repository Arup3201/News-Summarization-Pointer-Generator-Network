Raymond Roth, 47, the man who is believed to have faked his own drowning to claim the life insurance policy, was arrested again for calling his estranged wife after being released from jail.

Evana Roth filed a restraining order against her husband after he reappeared following a massive search at Jones Beach, where he was last seen entering the water for a swim on July 28.

Police spent thousands of dollars searching for him, only to find him driving on a South Carolina highway. He was arrested and released on $100,000 bail, ordered not to make contact with Mrs Roth.

He disobeyed the court order, allegedly phoning Mrs Roth repeatedly from an anonymous number and whispering 'You know who this is' to his terrified wife. Roth's attorney claims the man was just looking to discuss the sale of their house.

Arrested: Raymond Roth is escorted by law enforcement officers after being arrested after he allegedly faked his own drowning at a New York beach in a scheme to collect on a life insurance policy

Hurt: Roth's wife Evana said she has received numerous phone calls from him despite court order of protection

'It's like having a ghost call,' Leonard Leeds, Mrs Roth's attorney told the MailOnline.

'She was horrified. She's terrified. Obviously, this is somebody unpredictable. You think you're married one day and the next day that person is a total stranger.'

Roth surrendered to police at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, Long Island, yesterday.

He pleaded not guilty to charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud and falsely reporting an incident.

After posting $100,000 bail, he went home and promptly phoned his wife, despite court order specifically prohibiting him from doing so.

Mrs Roth, who has been overwhelmed by the dramatic events that have unfolded in  the past few weeks, answered a call from an anonymous number, thinking it was a friend or family member.

'She said "Who is this?"'  her attorney, Mr Leeds, told the MailOnline. 'He said, "You know who this is," and she hung up.'

Roth then called the house at least three more times, Mr Leeds said, leaving his wife bewildered and afraid.

Up for sale: Roth had put his Long Island home on the market days before he faked his death and was allegedly calling about the sale

Scrum: He was arrested at a hospital where he was receiving psychiatric treatment for depression

Cost: Tens of thousands of dollars were wasted searching for Roth at Jones Beach, Long Island

'It was eerie, I was scared and I started to shake,' Mrs Roth told the New York Post.

'She went from mourning him to fearing him,' Mr Leeds said.

The two have been married for 12 years. Mrs Roth has filed for divorce since the incident.

But Brian Davis, Roth's attorney, said that his client just wanted to discuss the sale of their home and had no intention of harassing Mrs Roth.

Voicemails obtained by the Post appear to indicate that that was the nature of at least one call.

'Um I’m just calling to tell you, you know I still love you. And I know you still love me,' Roth said to her voicemail.

'We do have a house to sell. We need to get together on the subject or sell it or let the bank take it -- one way or another.'

Despite the evidence, Mr Roth plead not guilty to charges of criminal contempt and posted bond at $10,000.

Charges: Roth was arraigned on Wednesday afternoon on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud and falsely reporting an incident

'Scheme': Roth's son Jonathan, left, and his attorney Joey Jackson after his appearance in court on Tuesday on charges that he helped his father to fake his death. Jonathan claims he was coerced

He was reported missing by his son on 
July 28 at Jones Beach. The elder Roth was later reported to be in 
Florida and got a speeding ticket in South Carolina.

His son, 22-year-old Jonathan, was arrested last week. According to court documents, the pair conspired to get more than $50,000 in life insurance money.

But Mr Davis said his client was not aware of an insurance scam and blamed the man's son.

'My client's intent was to disappear, not to cash in on a life insurance policy,' Mr Davis said.

He added that Jonathan Roth is the one who tried to cash in on the policy just days after reporting his father's disappearance. 'It was never my client's intent to make a claim,' he said.

Days after his disappearance, Raymond Roth was reported to be at a resort in Orlando, Florida and on August 2, he was stopped driving at 90 mph in Santee, South Carolina.

When police ran his name, they saw he was listed as missing, but Roth said he was driving back to New York and the officer let him continue.

Found: Roth left his shoes, wallet, clothing and phone on the beach when attempting to fake his death

Caught: More than a week after his disappearance, Roth was pulled over for speeding in South Carolina

But he failed to show up to a scheduled meeting with police and his attorney claimed he had in fact been admitted to hospital with depression.

Jonathan Roth, 22, is free on $10,000 bond. He has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, filing a false report and other charges.

Court papers show he 'was fully aware that his father never walked into the water and had in fact driven off in his own personal vehicle'.. He faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty.

The younger Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, said his client and his father had a 'strained' relationship and claims he was coerced into going along with the scheme - which Mr Davis has denied.

He also claimed he feared for his life after his father left him a threatening voicemail when the scandal went public.

'Listen, tough guy. You say you’ve been to the Marines and you can kill and everything else. When I get back, you are gonna do just that. One of us is going to die,' Roth allegedly said.

Raymond Roth's wife, Evana, said her husband had not told her of the scheme, and handed over emails she found on the family computer that implicated her stepson.

In one dated the day before he vanished, the elder Roth told his son to contact him at an Orlando resort to update him on developments following his disappearance.

'This is a terrible nightmare that I just want to wake up from,’ said 43-year-old Evana last week. 'Why did he do this? I think I’m just numb.’

Raymond Roth had put the family's home up for sale just days before he vanished, and Evana Roth also said her husband had recently been fired from his job in New York City.

Police estimated that an air and sea search for Roth cost tens of thousands of dollars.
