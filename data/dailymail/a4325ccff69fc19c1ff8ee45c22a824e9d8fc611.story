It is not an easy task, but Radio 2 has launched a project to unveil 'soundtrack to British culture,' in 50 records.

Yesterday, the first 10 songs in the series were 
unveiled representing an varied mix of styles from We’ll Meet Again by wartime morale booster Dame Vera Lynn, to Rehab by the late troubled singer Amy Winehouse.

In a landmark series called The People's Songs the station is attempting to chart the musical journey from the Second World War to the present day.

Yesterday, the first 10 songs in the series were unveiled representing an varied mix of styles from the wartime morale booster and songstress Dame Vera Lynn, left, to the late troubled singer Amy Winehouse

Broadcast in Janaury next year, the producers hope that through the song choices themes such as post World War II optimism, the punk years, mass immigration and the dangers of celebrity will all be explored.

We’ll Meet Again - Vera Lynn (1939)

Rock Island Line - Lonnie Donegan (1954)

She Loves You - Beatles (1963)

My Boy Lollipop - Millie Small (1964)

A Whiter Shade of Pale - Procul Harum (1967)

Je T’Aime... Moi Non Plus - Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin (1969)

God Save The Queen - Sex Pistols (1977)

Two Tribes - Frankie Goes To Hollywood (1984)

Ebeneezer Goode - The Shamen (1992)

Rehab - Amy Winehouse (2006)

All the song choices are billed as 'unforgettable and timeless,' and will not be presented in a chronological order, reported The Telegraph.

Controller of BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music Bob Shennan told the Radio Times: 'Music plays such an important part in people’s lives. This series will be moving and evocative in equal measure.'

Presented by Stuart Maconie, an hour-long episode will be devoted to each song.

The station wants listeners to get involved by contributing music stories.

It will be opened with We’ll Meet 
Again, exploring Dame Vera’s role in boosting wartime morale.

The programme states listeners will 
'hear from those who lived through WW2 - both those serving in the Armed
Forces and those on the Home Front - and discover the significance of 
music during the war years and how it kept the force's spirits up whilst
comforting those waiting anxiously at home. '

The Beatles: Stuart Maconie will recount the social change, optimism and Beatle-mania of the early '60s

The episode which features Amy Winehouse's number one hit song Rehab is entitled 'The Price of Modern Fame.'

The progamme bills as 'a tragic and extreme example of the price of fame in the UK in the Noughties.'

Mr Maconie will discuss his two 'very different, meetings with Amy,' while examining the the growth of celeb and tabloid culture in the past decade.

When My Boy Lollipop by Millie is 
featured the series will looks at the beginnings of modern 
multi-cultural Britain in the 1940s and when 
God Save the Queen by the Sex Pistols is featured it will take in the infamous year of the Silver Jubilee and punk. 

Stuart Maconie said: 'The People’s 
Songs is the story of modern Britain in 50 records. In the company of 
the Great British public, I aim to tell the story of the last seven 
decades via the records that sound-tracked this dramatic period; a 
period of conflict, social change, parties, prosperity, plenty, poverty,
peace and war.

'These are the songs that people listened to, laughed to, loved to and laboured to, as well as downed tools and danced to. And we’d love to hear from listeners.'

The remaining 40 songs will be unveiled next year.
