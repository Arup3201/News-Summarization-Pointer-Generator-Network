Victim: Frenchwoman Alexandra Blachere with a faulty implant

Women with faulty PIP breast implants are at risk of chemical exposure that causes damage to unborn babies, experts have warned.

Their report disputes previous warnings by the NHS that material inside the implants was ‘not toxic or carcinogenic’.

The scientists are now calling  for an inquiry into the potential side effects of PIPs.

Up to 47,000 British women could have received the French implants which were fraudulently filled with an industrial-grade silicone designed for mattresses.

Testing has previously revealed that PIP implants were up to six times as likely to rupture as other brands.

Writing in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, the group of experts called for women to be given ‘full information’ by British authorities.

The consumer protection group Antidote Europe said it disagreed with a report by the British Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulation Authority (MHRA)  that suggested the implants did not contain hazardous materials.

The body identified dangerous levels of chemicals in the implants, with one known as D4 being deemed of ‘high concern’ by European health officials.

Antidote Europe director and co-author of the report, Andre Menache, said: ‘Considering these known risks and the fact that most women receiving breast implants were of reproductive age, we would expect the MHRA and the Department of Health to fulfil its duty of care and thoroughly investigate these risks as well as provide full information to patients.’

The report says that thorough analysis of the gel within the PIP implants has yet to be carried out and also points towards possible contamination with lead, platinum and zinc during production.

The implants, made by the French company Poly Implant Prothese, were banned in March 2010 after a health scare in France.

Yesterday Rajiv Grover, president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said: ‘We reiterate our call for analysis to be conducted on collected samples taken “in vivo” rather than off-the-shelf, as it would also be advantageous to examine what impact body temperature and conditions have on them.’

‘Women who had or still have PIPs and the surgeons removing them know that more research is needed to explain what they are seeing and experiencing.’
