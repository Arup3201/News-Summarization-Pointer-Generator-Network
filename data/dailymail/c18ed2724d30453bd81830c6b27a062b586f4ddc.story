He had just one job to do but the Boxing Day Test's ground announcer  still made a whopping error.

When introducing teams at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, James Sherry accidentally announced over the loudspeaker that the Australian side was being led out by captain Michael Clarke instead of Steve Smith.

Clarke, who injured his hamstring during the first Test in Adelaide earlier this month, was actually preparing to commentate the game when the error was made.

Steve Smith, who has replaced Clarke as captain and smirked when the gaffe was made,  won the toss to bat first against India at the MCG.

Australia will reclaim the Border-Gavaskar trophy if they draw or win the third Test and Smith had no hesitation in batting first. 

'It looks a pretty good track so hopefully we can start well this morning,' Smith said.

India counterpart MS Dhoni admitted he would have made the same decision on what looks a pristine batting wicket. 

'We were looking to bat first, but I feel the first hour will be crucial,' Dhoni said. 

'It's important we bowl well in the first hour, but I feel the wicket will be quite the same and every morning there will be a bit in it for the fast bowlers.' 

Australia made two changes to the XI that defeated India by four wickets in Brisbane.

India also made two changes, with Mohammed Shami and debutant KL Rahul coming into the side for Varun Aaron and Rohit Sharma.
