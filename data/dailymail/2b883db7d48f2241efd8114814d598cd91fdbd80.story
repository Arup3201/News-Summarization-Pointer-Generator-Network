A tycoon ordered by a judge to hand his ex-wife £2 million has failed to pay up, claiming she is jealous of his relationship with a Ukrainian 12 years his junior.

Paul Grundy, 50, was said to have ‘recklessly’ splashed out a fortune on a playboy lifestyle and watched with ‘contempt’ as former wife Jennifer Francis, 48, ‘descends into poverty’.

She claimed the businessman – who lives on Dubai’s luxurious Palm Island – has been driving a Lamborghini Gallardo and spending thousands at Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Harvey Nichols and Yves Saint Laurent, frittering away £60,000 on ‘luxury goods’ last year alone.

wife Jennifer Francis (right) a £2million divorce settlement or face six
 weeks in jail after the High Court heard he was living a lavish 
lifestyle while she struggled financially

Mr Grundy has been told he will be jailed if he fails to pay his ex-wife, a former teacher, within three months.

But last night he accused her of being bitter over his relationship with blonde Ukrainian Asya Riabko.

The 38-year-old has started using his surname, but Mr Grundy said their wedding is on hold until he has resolved the dispute.

‘If
 I want to spend £1,000 in Harvey Nichols I’m not going to ask her [Miss
 Francis’s] permission,’ he said.

‘My Lamborghini was sold over 18 
months ago and I spend more than £40,000 a year on our son’s attendance 
at the top private school in England, which Jenny put him into, and lots
 of my shopping is for our son or Asya.’

The court heard Mr Grundy (right) lived a lavish lifestyle in Dubai, visiting racetracks and spending thousands in expensive boutiques after divorcing his wife of seven years

He said he suspected Miss 
Francis’s claims about his ‘reckless’ spending were due to jealousy, adding: ‘I’m now engaged to a Ukrainian girl who’s 38 –  and Jenny 
doesn’t like it. But she has not communicated with me directly for seven
 years.

‘She’s already had more than £1.6 million out of me and it’s 
impossible for me to get £2 million immediately because the business is 
in dire straits.

‘She lives in a five-bedroom house while I’m living in a two-bedroom flat, although it is on Palm Island in Dubai …

‘All
 I want to so is settle this thing by getting time to pay the 
money … the judge doesn’t seem to understand how business works in the 
Middle East.’

Mr Grundy and his former wife met in the late 1990s and 
lived in Pudsey, West Yorkshire.

The couple moved to Dubai (pictured) and made huge amounts of money from Mr Grundy's fencing business. But the High Court has heard their fortunes varied wildly after they split in 2009 and divorced in 2012

They married in 2002 and moved to Dubai, where he launched a lucrative business providing fencing for construction sites.

The
 couple bought a six-bedroom house with a swimming pool, a holiday home 
in France and a luxury flat in Miami. They were divorced in 2009.

According
 to Miss Francis – a mother of two boys, one from a previous marriage – 
she has since descended into poverty, renting accommodation in Oakhill, 
Somerset, while her ex-husband has lived the high life.

In 2012 Mr 
Grundy was assessed as having £2.5 million available – and was told to 
pay a £2 million lump sum and £300,000 in legal costs. He has failed to 
do so, claiming he does not have the funds to hand.

A judge at London's High Court has now ordered that Mr Grundy pay the divorce settlement or go to jail

But Miss 
Francis’s barrister Michael Bradley told a High Court judge on Thursday 
that Mr Grundy had ‘utter contempt for his wife and for the orders of 
this court’, adding: ‘It is clear he continues to lead a lavish 
lifestyle and that his claims of poverty are hollow.

‘She … is having to eke out her funds and watch every penny.’

Finding
 Mr Grundy does have enough money to pay, Mrs Justice Parker said: ‘He 
has money to fritter away on luxury goods but gave so little to the 
wife.’

She ordered him to sell his business interests to fund the divorce settlement.
