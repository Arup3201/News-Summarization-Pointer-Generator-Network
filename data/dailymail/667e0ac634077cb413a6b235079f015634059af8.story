Secret Labour plans for a multi-billion-pound package of new ‘property wealth taxes’ to hammer London and the well-to-do counties of southern England were leaked last night.

The Tories claim the proposals fly in the face of Ed Miliband’s claim to be a ‘one-nation’ leader and would only exacerbate the so-called ‘cost of living crisis’.

Tellingly, the report commissioned by Mr Miliband which contains details of the ‘triple tax whammy’ is marked ‘very sensitive’. It would mean that if he wins power in next year’s General Election:

New taxes planned: Ed Miliband, left, and former Wickes DIY store boss Bill Grimsey, right

The tax plans are part of a report by Labour adviser and former Wickes DIY store boss Bill Grimsey, aimed at reviving struggling town centres.

His blueprint would impose new levies on shop owners and businesses in the prosperous South of England – in addition to all farmers – to provide extra funds to run-down towns, mainly in the North.

Mr Grimsey will discuss his recommendations later this month with Mr Miliband and Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna, who recruited him to conduct the review.

But the Conservatives last night claimed the plans would set North against South, lead to a rise in high street prices, including food, and hit rural areas.

In addition, they said the proposals would mean a return to Labour’s failed high-tax policies of the 1970s.

In his report, Strengthening The High Street, Mr Grimsey says that the current business rates system, which raises £23 billion a year, is ‘no longer fit for purpose’. He calls for a ‘better balance of the taxation burden among property and business owners’.

In a candid, but strictly confidential, acknowledgement of the radical and controversial nature of his proposals, Mr Grimsey says Mr Miliband must ‘seize the initiative in this very sensitive area’  once he’s been elected Prime Minister – and sets out how he should do this.

He says Mr Miliband must scrap the current rule under which all firms pay the same level of rates based on the value of the properties they occupy.

Instead, a Labour government would immediately increase the level in prosperous areas (mainly the South) – and slash it in less prosperous areas (mainly the North) to tackle ‘geographical unfairness’.

Even more provocatively, if it wins power in May 2015, Labour should take advantage of rarely-used, special ‘retrospective’ laws to backdate the change three months to March, says Mr Grimsey.

Labour should ‘apply a regional factor to the rateable valuation of all business premises in March 2015 (retrospective to being elected) that addresses the geographical unfairness that has developed from the last (business rates) valuation,’ he explains.

Decay: The plans aim to redistribute funds to run-down towns

And rural communities would be hit by a plan for Mr Miliband to ‘bring farmland and farm buildings back into the business rate system’ to subsidise firms in other areas.

In another dramatic reform, Mr Grimsey says business rates, currently charged only on premises used for business purposes – for example, shops – should also be levied to the owners of such properties even if they have nothing to do with  the business.

Mr Miliband must ‘consider levying a percentage of the tax on property owners and not just the occupying business,’ he  confirms.

But Business Minister Matthew Hancock said: ‘Labour tried this flawed and divisive approach in the 1970s. It didn’t work then and it wouldn’t work now. It would increase rents, raise rates and cost residents.

‘Instead of penalising those who are doing well, Mr Miliband should focus on helping others learn from their success. Labour has no ideas other than taxing and spending more.

‘If shops and farms have to pay more tax, shopping bills will go up, making a nonsense of Mr Miliband’s talk about cutting the cost of living.’

The Tories also dismissed Mr Grimsey’s call on Mr Miliband to appoint a ‘Minister of High Streets’ as a gimmick.

He also urges wide-ranging new tax-raising powers for Business Improvement Districts (BIDs), groups of local entrepreneurs set up by Labour in 2003 to boost city and town centres.

Currently, BIDs, which operate in more than 100 towns, can charge firms only a modest levy.

All shop owners would be forced to pay a new ‘property owner’s tax’ separate from existing business rates – and on top of existing income tax.

Emergency laws would impose a new ‘business tax’ on firms in every prosperous city and town in England – backdated to before the election – to fund tax handouts to less well-off areas.

And a new £500 million ‘farm tax’ would be introduced by scrapping the exemption from business rates that has applied to agricultural land and buildings since 1929.
