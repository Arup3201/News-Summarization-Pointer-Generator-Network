There's an old adage that opposition parties don’t win elections, governments lose them. It’s a crutch that’s easy to lean on for those who subscribe to what’s becoming an ever more cautious approach to politics.

But parties rarely walk into Downing Street by default. You have to earn your right to govern. You can’t simply freewheel into No 10. You have to break the door down with a battering ram.

Recent polls showing a Tory resurgence are a timely reminder that Labour won’t win by fighting defensively and dodging punches. It’s time  we came out swinging.

Labour MP Simon Danczuk, right, believes leader Ed Miliband, left, needs to move away from his 'comfort zone' if the party is to win the next general election

For far too long, we’ve relied on the unpopularity and incompetence of this Government rather than focusing on our performance and offering solutions to the nation’s problems.

It was foolish to think that could carry on for ever. Sooner or later the Tories were always going to get their act together. Now we need to up our game.

The polls show that Labour’s message isn’t hitting home. We’ve become too comfortable with talking to ourselves, with policy announced through  set-piece speeches as though  in a university lecture.

Some in the party view politics as an intellectual pursuit; it’s not,  it’s a monumental struggle  to win hearts and minds.

At this stage in the electoral cycle there’s no point in just harping on about the Government’s failings and  it’s too late to rely on negative campaigning alone.

Mapping out a vision for a better Britain, however, won’t be achieved by just setting off  a few fireworks or coming up with some catchy slogans. It has to be part of a conversation that addresses people’s doubts. And it has to reach out beyond Labour’s core vote.

We won’t win a General Election by campaigning excessively on food banks and the bedroom tax. Labour has to offer a route out of poverty and unfulfilled potential.

Continually reciting a mantra of misery is not the answer.  We have to start speaking the language of aspiration.

Britain needs a Government with a convincing mandate to introduce the big changes that are required. But Labour can’t achieve that with the core vote and a few disgruntled Liberals. That’s a suicidal strategy.

Mr Danczuk said too many people in the Labour Party view the business of politics as 'an intellectual pursuit' rather than a 'monumental struggle'

UKIP has proved that there’s a rich seam of despairing voters out there. They’ve been ignored for far too long and Labour has to show it’s willing to listen.

It’s daft to characterise UKIP voters as disaffected loons, because many are simply working-class people tired of the three main parties. A lot are Labour people and we need to work hard to get them back.

There are still many in the party who think we have a right to govern. Some have mostly known Labour victories, which makes it easy for them to dismiss the 2010 Election as an aberration. New MPs such as myself know all too well there is no easy way back into power.

The latest polls are a wake-up call. But we should be under no illusion. Time is running out and if we don’t have a strong showing in the European and local elections this week then things will need to change.

Labour doesn’t need to panic – yet. But more of the same won’t cut it. Earning the trust of the public is hard and there are no short cuts.

Between now and election day there are many questions the electorate want answering. We can’t leave them unanswered.

From now on all signs need to point away from our comfort zone.
