Elder abuse: Rhonda Lee Miller, 39, was arrested this weekend after police found her 80-something mother living in deplorable conditions at a motel

A Florida special needs teacher was arrested this weekend for neglecting her 80-something-year-old mother.

Apopka Police discovered  39-year-old Rhonda Lee Miller's mother living with 16 cats in a feces-ridden room at the Crosby Motor Inn.

According to the police report, Miller's mother was covered in flea bites, didn't have access to medical care and hadn't been fed in days.

'The officers that responded are all veteran, tenured officers. They were all very, very disturbed by what they saw,' Apopka Police Sgt Ed Chittenden told Fox 35. 'They actually had to leave the room because of the smell of urine and the burning in their eyes, and the insect bites all over them.'

Motel owner John Crosby told WESH that he rarely saw Miller, but her mother had been living there since mid-December.

'From my understanding, since this started, she had been adopting the cats from Petco and places like that for the last three, four weeks and bringing them here,' Mr Crosby said.

He called police on Saturday after noticing an odor coming from the room. 

Mr Crosby said if it were just Miller
 staying in the room, she would have been kicked out weeks ago but he 
said he was concerned about the mother, who has dementia.

Miller had her first court appearance on Sunday where she was charged with elder abuse and bail was set at $1,000.

Before her arrest, Miller was a exceptional education teacher at Apopka High School. 

Orange County Public School officials
 said she would be barred from campus if she tried to show 
up for work on Monday. They wouldn't say how long she had been working 
for the school district but records reveal she has a prior criminal 
record. She has been on felony probation for check fraud and grand theft
 since 2012.

'The schools do the absolute best they can in going through and doing background investigations on people, but it is a little upsetting to see that there is a teacher that would treat her mother this way,' Sgt Chittenden said.

Miller's mother was taken to Florida Hospital to be treated for high blood pressure and low oxygen levels and was in fair condition as of Monday afternoon.

She has since been placed in the custody of the Department of Children and Families. It's uncertain what the mother's actual age is, since it has previously been recorded as 83. 85 and 86.
