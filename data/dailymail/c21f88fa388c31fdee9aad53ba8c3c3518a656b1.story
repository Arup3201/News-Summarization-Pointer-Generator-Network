A veteran volunteer firefighter and father-of-two has been killed in a hunting accident by his best fried, who mistook the man for a deer and fatally shot him.

Prosecutors are now investigating whether to bring forward charges following the incident that left 52-year-old Long Island man Charles Bruce dead.

Bruce, who worked as an electrician and was part of the Malverne fire department, was on an annual weekend hunting trip in upstate Westford, N.Y., just east of Cooperstown, with a group of fellow firefighters.

Authorities say the death occurred Saturday afternoon in the woods, according to NBC New York.

Tragedy: Charles Bruce, 52, has been killed in a N.Y. state hunting accident by his best friend, who is now facing possible criminal charges

The terrible accident took place Saturday in the woods of upstate Westford, N.Y.

Bruce was walking out of the bushland as it started to get dark about 4.30pm when his friend, who was hiding in a tree about 60 yards away, fired a shot that struck Bruce in the chest, according to Otsego County district attorney John Muehl.

The shooter, who is said to be 'inconsolable' has not been identified.

A Malverne fire department spokesman said the shooter was a former volunteer and one of Bruce's best friends.

'It's a difficult thing to kill your best friend,' Muehl said.

'But there is no excuse for shooting someone.

criminal charges against the hunter.

'I know he is heartbroken,' Muehl said.

'But he violated the first rule of hunting.

'You don't aim your gun at something unless you have positively identified it as a target.'

Bruce was not wearing blaze orange when he was shot, the DA said.

Wearing the color is not required by law, but the Department of Environmental Conservation told CBS 2′ that there hasn’t been a single accident in 10 years when a hunter was wearing the color.

Black and purple bunting hung on the outside of the Malverne fire house on Tuesday as colleagues mourned Bruce, a firefighter of 17 years.

He was described by department spokesman Dave Gildea as a 'very active guy' who loved hunting, running and smoking cigars.

Bruce was the father of two grown children.

'It's just a terrible tragedy,' Gildea said. 

On average there are more than 20 shooting accidents, including about three fatalities, during the typical hunting season each year.
