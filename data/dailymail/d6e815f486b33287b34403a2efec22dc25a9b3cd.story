Neymar's agent has blasted Luis Felipe Scolari following Brazil's World Cup semi-final humiliation, calling him 'an old jerk' and 'repulsive' in a sarcastic Twitter list.

Ribeiro produced a list of 'six requirements to be Brazilian coach' and proceeded to belittle many achievements in Scolari's managerial career.

Neymar missed the semi-final after fracturing the third vertebrae of his back in the last eight win over Colombia, leading to an outpouring of national grief, and faces a race against time to be fit for the start of the season with Barcelona.

Ribeiro wrote on his Twitter account: 'One - being Portugal Coach and winning nothing.'

'Two - going to Chelsea and being sacked the following day.'

'Three - going to coach in Uzbekistan.'

Four - returning to Brazil, taking over a big team [Palmeiras] and getting them relegated to the second division.'

'Five - leaving the club 56 days before the end of the Brasileirao [season] to 'escape' the relegation.

'Six - being an old jerk, arrogant, repulsive, conceited and ridiculous.'

The fact Neymar's agent is willing to make public such negative feelings about the Selecao's coach sums up the mood in Brazil that he should be sacked and replaced as soon as possible.

Scolari was defiant after Tuesday's 7-1 thrashing at the hands of Germany, saying although it was the worst moment of his career, he would not step down from the post.

His last match, however, could be Saturday's Third Place Play-off with Holland in Brasilia.

Scolari's insistence that his squad were 'still developing' and that most would be in the 2018 World Cup is not borne out by the facts.

Out of the current Brazil squad, only five the 23 players will be under 30 in 2018, while 14 of the current Germany squad will still be in their 20s.

Tite is viewed as Scolari's most likely replacement, with Sao Paulo coach Muricy Ramalho and former Brazil and Real Madrid manager Vanderlei Luxemburgo also in the running.

Scolari has continued to insist his record was something to be proud of, telling a news conference on Wednesday: 'It's the first time we reached a semi-final since 2002 so maybe our work wasn't so bad.

In a year and a half together we played 28 games and won 19, drew six and lost three.

'In official games we won eight, drew two and lost this one - okay, catastrophically. But this episode is over now. We must look forward.

'We have a commitment with the CBF (Brazilian FA) until the end of the World Cup.

'It is only after this we will talk with the direction of the CBF, that's when we will decide.'
