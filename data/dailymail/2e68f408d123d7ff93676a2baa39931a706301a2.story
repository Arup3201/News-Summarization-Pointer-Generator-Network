'Practice makes perfect', 'the grass is always greener on the other side' and 'good things come to those who wait' are just some of the words of wisdom given to people in childhood, which they still refer back to as adults.  

Of the 2,000 adults polled in the survey, which was carried out by children's charity NSPCC, 75 per cent  said they can still recount a piece of advice given to them in their early years. 

The research was carried out by the NSPCC to launch their mantra: every childhood is worth fighting for. The message of the research is that any adult can have a positive and lasting effect on a child's life.

'Practice makes perfect', 'the grass is always greener on the other side' and 'good things come to those who wait' were the top three most influential sayings we remember from childhood

'Practice makes perfect' (63 per cent), 'treat others how you'd like to be treated' (62 per cent) and 'if at first you don't succeed try, try and try again' (54 per cent) were the top ten sayings adults remembered being taught by their parents.

However, there were also a few old wives tales on the list with 'eat your crusts they'll make your hair curly' (26 per cent) and 'eating carrots will help you see in the dark' (30 per cent) also sneaking in.

According to the research, parents are the biggest source of childhood wisdom (85 per cent), with grandparents (49 per cent) and teachers (28 per cent) also cited as sources of sage words. 

It seems these words of advice go full circle with 81 per cent of mums and 72 per cent of dads saying they use well-known expressions to teach their own children.

'Two wrongs don't make a right' (20 per cent) and 'it's not the winning, it's the taking part that counts' (17 per cent) were the two most commonly recited phrases by parents today.

When quizzed on the maxims that respondents try to live their own lives by, almost half said 'treat others how you'd like to be treated', more than one in three cited 'manners cost nothing', a third quoted 'practice makes perfect' and 32 per cent chose 'if at first you don't succeed try, try and try again'.  

1. Practice makes perfect (63 per cent)

2. Treat others how you'd like to be treated (62 per cent)

3. If at first you don't succeed try, try and try again (54 per cent)

4. Manners cost nothing (52 per cent)

5. You can't judge a book by its cover (45 per cent)

6. Good things come to those who wait (47 per cent)

7. Two wrongs don't make a right (41 per cent)

8. It's not the winning, it's the taking part that counts (38 per cent)

9. Never say never (37 per cent)

10. There's no time like the present (34 per cent)

There were also gender differences. Women appeared more likely to practice patience – a quarter of the women polled said they live by 'good things come to those who wait' compared to just 14 per cent of men.

Women were also shown to be slightly more empathetic than men when choosing their favourite words of wisdom with over half living by the phase 'treat others how you'd like to be treated', compared to 42 per cent of men. 

The NSPCC commissioned the research to help illustrate their message: childhood shapes who we become - but abuse never should.

Celebrities, such as Stephen Fry, Alan Sugar, Piers Morgan, have all shared their own childhood words of wisdom using #childhoodwisdom.

Other celebrities to join the trend include actress Gemma Atkinson and Radio 1 DJ Matt Edmondson.

Gemma tweeted: 'Being told to drink lots of water. Dad told me it'd make me strong like a lion. Random but I always remember it', under the hashtag.

'"Think like a dog" (i.e. live in the moment!)', was Matt's tweet.

Peter Wanless, CEO of the NSPCC, said: 'We're entering a fresh phase in the NSPCC's 130-year history.

'We want to show how actions that all of us can take, help ensure children's experiences are positive and one way of doing this is to impart words of wisdom.

'Abuse robs children of a happy childhood but it doesn't have to be that way.'
