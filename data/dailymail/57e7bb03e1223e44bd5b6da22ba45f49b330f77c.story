While mulled wine and egg nog are the traditional festive tipples of choice, it seems they might have competition this year from an even older beverage - real ale.

According to sales figures, the barley and hops based brew has enjoyed record sales as people stock up ahead of Christmas Day.

In the last week alone, Tesco reported selling a staggering 1.5 million bottles of the alcoholic drink - the largest amount it has ever sold over a seven-day period.

The reason for the sales boom, say the superstore's experts, are a growing interest in real ale as an accompaniment to food.

According to food enthusiasts, pale ale goes well with fish, while malt beer is the perfect partner for turkey and goose, as well as a good alternative for those who dislike wine.

The popularity of the drink has also been boosted by the Campaign For Real Ale and the increasing availability of the drink in traditional pubs.

Surprisingly, demand for the drink is highest among younger consumer - a sea change in attitudes given that until recently, ale was considered the preserve of older male drinkers.

As a result, stores are now stocking a huge variety of different ales, with Tesco alone increasing its offering from 20 types in 2006 to 350 brews in 2013.

Of the brews on offer, sales
figures reveal that the ales most likely making it onto Christmas dinner tables
 are Old Speckled Hen, Newcastle Brown Ale, Theakstons Old 
Peculiar, Fullers London Pride, and Badger Fursty Ferret.

Christmas ales, including Santa's Beard, Bateman’s Seasonal Ale, Santa’s 
Swallie Christmas Beer, Shepherd Neame Christmas Ale, and Thwaite’s 
Yule Love It, are also proving popular.

Commenting on the figures, Tesco ale buyer Chiara Nesbitt said: 'Ale is an ideal match with the Christmas feast due to its cosy, warming flavours which perfectly complement the roasted, savoury and spicy tastes on offer in the main course as well as with the fruit in the pudding and mince pies plus the cheese and biscuits later on.

'Brewers are increasingly producing new and exciting products with connoisseurship in ale rivalling that in wine.

'With demand growing at its present rate we believe that it won’t be too long before restaurants offer up ale lists with their food menus and cheese courses.

'There has never been a more exciting time to drink beer as the last few years have seen an explosion of small brewers producing exciting new beers, often made with locally available ingredients.

'Sales of bottled ales have been growing steadily since the mid-noughties but this is by far the highest demand we have ever seen in Christmas week which would indicate that people will be drinking it with their roast turkey.'

Perfect partner: According to Tesco, malty ales taste wonderful with Christmas turkey and goose

Christmas dinner doesn't have to mean imbibing vats of wine. Whether you're tucking into a turkey or chomping on a Christmas pudding, Tesco's beer experts have a beer for you. 

FISH

Drink light ales to bring out delicate fish flavours.  Two that are worth a try are Castle Rock Harvest Pale Ale (CAMRA Champions Beer Of 
Britain 2010) or Badger Golden Champion.

TURKEY AND GOOSE

Malty ales work best to add to the fuller flavour of
 these birds. Suggested matches are Fullers London Pride or 
Marstons Pedigree.

CHRISTMAS PUDDING

Contrast the fruit and peel of the pudding with the
 chocolate malts of Hobgoblin ale or the subtle sweetness of 
Banana Bread Beer.

CHEESE

For mild varieties, a light ale such as Eagle IPA is best, while strong cheeses such as mature cheddar taste wonderful with Hobgoblin.

Those tucking into strong blue cheese should try an aged ale which have have great depth and flavour and are best to 
cut through the strong mature cheeses. Old Tom which was 
voted the world’s best ale in 2009 is a good choice, although its worth noting that it has a similar strength to wine and should be sipped like a good port.
