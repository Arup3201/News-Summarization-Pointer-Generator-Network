Friday night's Comic Relief on BBC1 pulled in a record £75million for charity.

But many parents were left fuming over explicit sexual references in sketches broadcast before 8pm.

In one, Rowan Atkinson, playing the Archbishop of Canterbury, told viewers that Jesus said love your neighbours 'but it doesn't mean sh*g your neighbours'.

Complaints: Rowan Atkinson as the Archbishop of Canterbury filming of his sketch for Comic Relief 2013

In the face of a 'significant' number of complaints, the BBC yesterday removed the sketch from its iPlayer service, after the lapses provoked anger on social networking sites.

A BBC spokesman said there had been a 'surge of feeling' that the sketch had not 'struck the right note' and a decision had been taken to pull it from iPlayer.

In another gaffe, comedian John Bishop had to apologise after insulting people from Newcastle during his live presenting slot alongside Davina McCall.

The pair were discussing Miranda Hart's madcap week of fundraising, which included organising a dog show in Oxford.

Bishop, 46, said: 'I'm glad they put it all in that order and the dog show was in Oxford and not Newcastle. It wouldn't be very good having a dog show with Rottweilers.'

He quickly backtracked, but only seemed to make things worse by saying: 'I do love people of the North East, please don't send your dogs down here.'

Later the Liverpudlian comic took to Twitter, writing: 'To the people of Newcastle no offence was intended by anything I said tonight - it's a live show, off the cuff jokes were not meant to upset x'

One Twitter user wrote: 'John Bishop calling geordie girls dogs and that we all headbutt eachother. pretty sure he's from liverpool... cough, awkward.'

Another said: 'Are you sure you're not just running away from the Geordies???' when Bishop tweeted about boarding a plane to a comedy festival this morning.

starvation in Africa and domestic abuse in the UK.
