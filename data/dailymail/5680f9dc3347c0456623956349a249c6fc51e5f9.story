They might not have been quite as intimidating as Mitchell Johnson but Eoin Morgan found himself facing two more formidable opponents on his welcome to New Zealand in a Maori warrior and the Mayor of Wellington.

After England appeared to get cold feet on their big Valentine’s Day date with Australia they were greeted more warmly here in the New Zealand capital even though the local English mayor was clearly batting for the opposition.

Celia Wade-Brown, born in West London but a Wellington resident for more than 30 years, firstly welcomed England captain ‘Eoin Rogers’ and then said: ‘Don’t be fooled by the accent – I’m supporting New Zealand on Friday.’

The slip of the tongue from the Green Party politician followed Morgan being met with a scary looking Maori challenge, which he accepted immaculately while maintaining eye contact with the warrior throughout, before England were given an official Powhiri, a traditional and far more friendly welcome.

Now all Morgan has to do is end a run of four ducks in five innings when England face the other co-hosts, a New Zealand team who are almost as frightening as Australia even though they had a jittery win over Scotland.

Still, rubbing noses with a host of dignitaries in New Zealand is far more agreeable than coming face to face with opening World Cup opponents who appear to be playing a completely different one-day game to England.

England, for now, can forget all about an Australian team who have beaten them four times already on this trip to extend their mastery over the old enemy that was firmly established on the Ashes tour over a year ago.

But life could well be just as difficult for Morgan - not Rogers - when they meet a New Zealand side who had a nervous encounter of their own with Scotland in Dunedin today before winning by three wickets in a low scoring game.

The captain is clearly discovering just how tricky leading England in a big tournament can be.
