A man has revealed his horrifying childhood as a five-year-old sex slave in Florida, where he says a member of his family made thousands forcing him to indulge the pedophile desires of pillars of the local community.

Jerome Elam said that he was taken advantage of by a relative, who kept him in servitude for seven years and made him participate in child pornography and take drugs.

He said that clients of his trafficker would beat, choke and rape him - and punish him severely whenever he tried to escape his life of abuse.

Elam told local station WTLV how he was dragged in and out of school in Jacksonville to fulfill the whims of his relatives' clients, whom he claims were often doctors and lawyers with a 'darker side'.

Sex slave: Jerome Elam, pictured above as a boy in the 1970s, said he was trafficked, choked and raped by members and clients of a pedophile ring operating in Florida

He said: 'I would be pulled out of school at times and what they would do is they would set up a list of clients and this would take place in hotels, in campers, in store rooms, whatever location they chose we would be forced to go to.'

'There was no depth of depravity these people had, so it was a very lucrative business... They looked like the people you would see in church on Sunday.

'These were doctors and lawyers and people who were well respected but the darker side of them were never exposed until they got into the after hours trafficking part of it.'

In a first-person account for the Communities Digital News website, Elam told how he was subjected to beatings and rape by each member of a pedophile ring before he was turned over to the clients.

He wrote: 'My indoctrination to the “group,” as they often referred to themselves in private, consisted of being raped and beaten by each member...

Today: Elam said he is sharing his horrific story so that other victims will see there is hope for their future

'Children were choked unconscious to satisfy the twisted sexual appetites of a select few of the members, and many clients of the trafficking ring also shared this sick practice.

He also said that his 'handlers' would take revenge on him if he tried to escape or alert anybody to his plight.

Elam wrote that he was beaten and had three of his ribs broken after he tried to tell a doctor what was happening to him.

According to child abuse experts, pimps can make as much as $200,000 per year from a single child, and often have as many as six under their control at any given time.

Elam said that he escaped and was able to build a new life for himself after a suicide attempt left him in hospital and gave him the opportunity to escape.

He said he is sharing his story to encourage other victims of sex trafficking to realize that they can reclaim their lives.
