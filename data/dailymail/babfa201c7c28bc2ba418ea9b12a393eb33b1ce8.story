A town in Michigan has been targeted by a cruel animal abuser who has apparently dumped more than a dozen starving dogs near a pet store.

The small dogs, which all seem to be maltese-poodle crossbreeds, were highly emaciated and filthy when they were found and taken into care.

Police are now hunting for the culprit, who could face a jail sentence if he is found to have abused the pets.

Abandoned: More than a dozen dogs have been dumped near a pet store in Troy, Michigan

Helpless: It is not known why the animals were left to fend for themselves on the street

Cruel: The animals were in an appalling state before they were cleaned up by animal welfare workers

Care: The dogs are being nursed back to health so they can be adopted and find a loving new home

The dogs started being left near a branch of PetSmart in Troy, Michigan in April this year, according to the Detroit Free Press.

Most were dumped behind the building and later found by store employees, although some were discovered in other locations nearby.

After tracking down the dogs - which sometimes required chasing after them for up to an hour - workers turned them over to the Animal Welfare Society of Southeastern Michigan.

This week, the problem got even worse as six emaciated animals were found in the area in a single day.

Filth: The animals were found with matted fur and covered in faeces having clearly been neglected

Nurture: The dogs were showered and thoroughly cleaned once the pet store turned them over to the Animal Welfare Society of Southeastern Michigan

Filth: The neglected dogs, apparently all maltese/poodle crossbreeds, were caked in mud

Cheery: The dogs seemed to react well to being washed and finally receiving some nurturing

PetSmart workers are baffled about the culprit's motives - pointing out that the store does not even sell dogs.

'If they'd just call us, we can refer them to a rescue group or the Humane Society,' manager Nikki Taylor told the Free Press. 'We just don't want this continuing.'

The animals, which are aged between two and six years old, appear scarred by their experiences and are nervous of people.

Debris: This bowl contains two pounds of matted fur and faeces cut from a single dog

Suffering: Some of the animals are clearly traumatised and find it hard to interact normally

Hungry: This fluffy pet welcomed the chance to get fed for the first time in a while

Unwanted: But workers have no idea why someone has been dumping the animals around Troy

One dog was about to give birth when she was abandoned, but thankfully her puppies were delivered safely.

A volunteer at the Animal Welfare Society said that the dogs were 'in terrible condition', with matted fur, covered in faeces and dangerously thin.

The animals will be put up for adoption once they have been nursed back to full health.

Danger: The animals looked as if they had never had their claws trimmed by their owners

Punishment: If the serial abuser is found, he or she could face a hefty prison sentence

Pals: These three poodles were found together and then handed over to a foster home

Epidemic: This is one of six dogs found abandoned near the pet store in a single day this week

Authorities are looking for the person who dumped the dogs - although it is possible that a number of different people could be responsible.

'I think it's a breeding situation,' Ashley LaPorte of the Animal Welfare Society told the Free Press. 'I guess they have too many and theyâ€™re overwhelmed. Or it could also be a hoarding situation.

'But whatever's going on, it's pretty heartless that they're dropping them off by the freeway.'

Relief: But rescuers fear that some animals may not have been so lucky

Cosy: The Welfare Society has given the dogs shelter after receiving them from the pet store, which does not sell dogs

Heartless: The person who dropped them off could be an overwhelmed dog breeder
