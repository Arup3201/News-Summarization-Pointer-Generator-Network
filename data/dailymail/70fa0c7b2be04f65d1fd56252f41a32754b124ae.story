Bosses at an NHS trust have sparked outrage by recreating the infamous “ear-cutting” torture scene from Reservoir Dogs - to promote a new flu jab campaign - just weeks after being condemned for 400 ‘needless’ deaths.

Senior medics dressed up as characters like Mr Orange, Mr Pink and Mr White from the 1992 Quentin Tarrantino heist film for a video to persuade their staff to get vaccinated against the virus.

But the light hearted five minute film has provoked fury after it featured a department head from Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust reenacting the murder scene in which Mr Blonde played by actor Michael Madsen slices off a policeman’s ear.

Bosses at an NHS health trust have sparked outrage by recreating the infamous 'ear-cutting' torture scene from Reservoir Dogs - to promote a new flu jab campaign

In the sequence Anthony Freestone, Head of Resuscitation at the Lancashire Trust, dances around a terrified bound and gagged man played by an NHS worker in a boiler room before pretending to inject him with a hypodermic needle.

Other sequences show three of the medics dressed in black suits and sunglasses stalking hospital corriders then bundling a nurse in a side room before she is forced to undergo a jab.

A third clip shows one of the doctors opening up a black attache case and smiling menacingly as if receiving a hitman’s murder kit before the case is revealed to be laden with hypodermic needles.

The film, nicknamed “Reservoir Docs”, was made by the Blackpool Trust just weeks after it was condemned over 400 “needless” patient deaths in just one year in a report compiled by NHS England medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh.

Sean Gibson, regional organiser for 
public service union Unison, said:  'My jaw hit the floor when I saw 
this video - it just beggars belief that someone thought it was a good 
idea.

'For the hospital trust to decide to film scenes about promoting good health based on one of the most violent and notorious movies in history is very badly thought out indeed.

'I understand that they wanted to convey a message but I found the content very threatening especially with the way people are being threatened with drugs. I know it is meant to be humorous but I think it has totally missed that.

'The video is very threatening. I know it is supposed to be tongue in cheek but it is a very badly thought through analogy. Using films like Resevoir Dogs - no matter how well meaning - is not appropriate to promote a a health campaign.

'The NHS has a zero tolerance policy 
towards violence and this flies in the face of that. At one point a 
worker is threatened with drugs, which is outrageous.

'I am writing to the hospital’s chief executive immediately to demand that it is withdrawn.'

The video is the latest produced by the Trust each year to encourage staff to get themselves inoculated against the flu virus.

It starts with the doctors who call themselves the Flu Fighters gather around a table in a canteen chatting like the robbers in the movie.

They then stepping out like in the iconic opening scenes of the film to go to the hospital to administer the flu jabs.

The video ends with mughots of all four 
characters with the message: 'Don’t make us send the boys round. Get 
your flu vaccincation now.'

Communications assistant Lee Rayner, said: 'The video shows how a serious message can be driven home in a fun and innovative way.

'We wanted to raise awareness among 
staff about the importance of being vaccinated but we wanted the message
to be delivered in a fun and engaging way.'

Mark Wrigley, haematology laboratory 
manager at Blackpool Victoria Hospital who starred in the film said: “It
was great fun to be involved and the feedback I have had already has 
been amazing.

But the union Unison has condemned the video's use of drugs and violence. A spokesman said: 'Using films like Resevoir Dogs - no matter how well meaning - is not appropriate to promote a a health campaign'

The Unison spokesman added: 'The NHS has a zero tolerance policy towards violence and this flies in the face of that. At one point a worker is threatened with drugs, which is outrageous'

'Underneath it all is a serious message but hopefully by putting it across like this we can help get the message across in the best way.” While it is not likely to top many awards lists, the trust is hoping its film is a hit with staff.

Caroline Hastie, head of communications at the trust, said: 'Last year’s video created huge interest among our staff who enjoyed the film but also took the message to heart.

'It created a real buzz and our staff vaccination levels rose dramatically as a result. We are hoping this year’s video will help us improve on those figures even more.'
