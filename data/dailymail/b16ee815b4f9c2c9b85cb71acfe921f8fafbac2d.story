Karl Lagerfeld has got a fearsome reputation for intimidating people. But last night he revealed that he's learning to soften up, thanks to his Persian cat Choupette.

During a Q&A session at the Lincoln Center in New York with friend and actress Jessica Chastain, the 80-year-old Chanel designer said of the pet: 'She’s helped me to become a nicer person. There’s something very touching about her. Even if she is spoiled beyond.'

He added that the gray and white feline is the perfect companion because having a dog would require going out for walks - something he prefers not to do, being so 'recognizable.'

Fashion legend: Karl Lagerfeld has got a fearsome reputation for intimidating people - but last night he revealed that he's learning to soften up, thanks to his Persian cat Choupette

'I cannot walk in the street anymore,
I’m too easy to recognize . . . It's a nightmare,' he said, sat dressed
in his signature black pants, blazer, high-collared white shirt and 
leather fingerless gloves.

Ms Chastain, 36, who was wearing a bejeweled Chanel cocktail dress for the occasion, said she is yet to meet Choupette but has heard many stories about her.

The pet belonged to one of Mr Lagerfeld's friends originally. But after he cat-sat for two weeks, he refused to let her go.

'[She] is the most beautiful cat in the world . .  [and] very clean,' he mused. With no spouse or children, Mr Lagerfeld joked earlier this year that he would marry the animal if he could.

During last night's 40-minute conversation with Ms Chastain, Mr Lagerfeld also opened up about the way fashion has changed over his six-decade-long career.

He said the 'role of the red carpet' and Photoshop have had a huge impact on the industry.

'The red carpet is not fashion; it’s always the same silhouette,' he observed. 'Fashion is something else than the red carpet, but the red carpet is a part of our world, our fashion world… It [can be] a little too much sometimes.

As for Photoshop, he said: '[We are] easily in a period of over-retouching.

'Some models [end up] look[ing] as if they are coming out of a funeral parlor, all life taken out of the face, I hate that.'

He also touched on how fashion design has lost some of its magic.

'Lots of designers these days don’t sketch anymore.

'Choupette is the most beautiful cat in the world and very clean- she helped me become a nicer person'

'They have studios [or] do it with a computer. I do everything myself because I like physically the work of sketching.'

Despite his charismatic and mysterious demeanor, Mr Lagerfeld went on to describe himself as being 'boring' behind closed doors.

He explained that he does not drink, smoke or do drugs, likes to 
get seven hours of sleep a night, and prefers to stay indoors away from the public.

He
continued: 'I would hate to be friends with people like me, that's too 
boring', adding that he 'admires people who destroy themselves.'

Despite the 'dullness', Mr Lagerfeld summed up his life as being 'quite pleasant'.

Indeed, thanks to his career success, he is able to afford the luxury 
of having two houses in Paris - one for work, one for sleep - and a bank
balance topping millions of dollars.

He
explained that he was ambitious from a young age - teaching himself 
four languages by the time he was six - and today he considers fashion 
as a round-the-clock occupation.

'I would hate to be friends with people like me, that's too boring - I admire people who destroy themselves'

During the night he says he often wakes up to make notes in a sketch book, which he keeps close to his pillow.

He added that his 'tough' mother never attended one of his shows, and in her later years she shunned his designs in favor of Sonia Rykiel's.

Despite his self-deprecating remarks, friends of Mr Lagerfeld's, present at the event, described him as anything but 'boring'.

British-born Harper's Bazaar 
editor Glenda Bailey - who coordinated the Q&A session - said she had known the German fashion legend for about 27 years and was 'in awe of him' long before they met.

After getting to know him personally, she fondly said: 'He has such wit and sense of fun.'

Meanwhile, American artist Jess Koons said he loved working with Mr Lagerfeld on photo shoots, and some of the best advice he received was: 'Confidence is the key to dressing well.'
