A carer who secretly buried a dead man in a rockery so she and his wife could continue to claim his benefits could be sent back to jail because falling gold prices mean she can’t repay the money.

Boqer-Ore Adie, 44, and Rebekah Sturdey, 57, were jailed earlier this year after they claimed £77,318 in benefits in Geoffrey Sturdey's name for nearly four years after he died.

They had buried him in the garden of the Sturdeys' isolated farm near Tregaron, West Wales, after he died suddenly of natural causes. The last confirmed sighting of him was in October 2008, when he was 60.

Family: Wife Rebekah (left), 56, claimed he'd gone travelling around Europe to explain his absence. Boqer-Ore Adie’s daughter Hazel, 21, (right) pleaded not guilty which was accepted by the prosecution. Her stepsister Karmel admitted preventing the burial and was given a suspended sentence

Both women have since been released, but now Adie faces being returned to prison unless she repays  £46,116 - which she used to buy gold bullion only for it to fall in value, Swansea Crown Court heard.  

A proceeds of crime hearing was told that Adie, who was a registered carer for Mr Sturdey before his death, had assets worth £70,00 in gold coins and cash.

However, the court heard Adie said she had sold the gold and had only made £37,545 due to a fall in prices.

She said she couldn’t get hold of the remaining £8,571 in time for this week's deadline.

Judge Paul Thomas said he would give her a further three months to come up with the money, or face a 12 month prison sentence.

Grave: Adie and Rebekah Sturdey had buried Mr Sturdeyin the garden of the couple's isolated farm near Tregaron, West Wales, after he died suddenly of natural causes

Adie was jailed for 20 months in February alongside Mrs Sturdey for wrongly claiming benefits after hiding Mr Sturdey's body in a makeshift garden grave at the farm where the couple ran a religious sect. 

The Sturdeys set up the community at their 20-acre farm called Beth Berithnear, and Adie lived there with her daughter Hazel and her stepdaughter Karmel.

The group studied the Old Testament and believed Jesus would soon return to the earth.

Mr Sturdey said that when he died he wanted to be buried in the rockery so he would be able to rise from the dead.

After he passed away Mrs Sturdey, Adie and Karmel dug a grave and buried him in his chosen spot - but failed to notify the authorities of his death.

Officials became suspicious after thousands of pounds of disability allowance and pension credits continued to be paid in Mr Sturdey's name.

Mrs Sturdey lied to benefits investigators, telling them that her husband had gone on a touring holiday around Europe. However, Mr Sturdey did not have a valid passport and a specialist police search was launched at the cost of £20,000.

Investigation: Mr Sturdey was dug up and examined so police could rule out foul play before being returned to his grave in the rockery, in accordance with his wishes

Falling value: The court heard Adie had sold the gold and had only made £37,545 back due to a fall in prices

A court was told his 'remarkably well-preserved body' was found buried under the rockery.

He was dug up and examined so police could rule out foul play before being returned to his grave in the rockery, in accordance with his wishes.

Sturdey and Adie admitted fraud and conspiracy to prevent his lawful and decent burial. Karmel Adie, 26, also admitted preventing the burial.

The pair were jailed for 20 months earlier this year and have since been released from prison. Mrs Sturdey has repaid her share of the money.

Karmel Adie was given nine-month suspended sentence. Hazel Adie, 21, pleaded not guilty which was accepted by the prosecution.

Swansea Crown Court heard Hazel was only 15 at the time and was 'under the influence' of the older women. 

Prosecutor Huw Rees explained the group's unusual domestic set-up.

He said: 'Their home contained a large number of religious books.

'They were not part of any organised group but they studied the Bible particularly the Old Testament and Adie had taught herself Hebrew.

'Mr Sturdey had chosen his own burial plot where he expected to be raised from the dead.

'The group expected Jesus's return to earth after his death.'
