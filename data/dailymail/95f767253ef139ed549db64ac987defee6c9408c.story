Fans of the film Pretty Woman are in for a treat.

To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the  romantic comedy starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, the Four Seasons Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, which served as the setting for the film, is offering a themed package for guests.

With three levels of pampering, the hotel's 'Pretty Woman for a Day' package is chock full of perks to have guests feeling beautiful in no time.

Fans of Pretty Woman can now experience a special themed weekend at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California

With prices ranging from $15,000 to $100,000, the weekend getaway packages may require guests to be a 'corporate raider' themselves

At the cheapest offering, the $15,000 (£10,000) deluxe package includes accommodations in a Deluxe Beverly Suite, as well as a personal shopper for two hours on Rodeo Drive.

Guests will receive a dining etiquette lesson, private styling in their suite, a 60-minute couples massage at the Spa at Beverly Wilshire, and a cultural date night: a picnic with limo for two hours and a romantic dinner on the Veranda Suite Terrace.

To remember the amazing experience, couples will be offered the chance to pose for photographs to recreate memorable scenes from the film.

As part of the luxurious offerings, guests will receive a personal shopper to take them out on Rodeo Drive - and style them after

Guests have the option to stay in either the Deluxe Suite, the Veranda Suite or even the stunning 'Pretty Woman' Presidential Suite

Guests who opt for the Beverly Wilshire's ultimate package, for $100,000, will receive a 'diamond manicure and pedicure'

For $22,500 (£15,000), instead of the deluxe suite, guests will be upgraded to the Veranda Suite, gain an additional hour of personal shopping time and a $1,000-pe-rperson clothing allowance for their outing.

A longer couples massage and a musical serenade during the picnic lunch is also included.

And for those really looking to splash out on a memorable weekend, look no further than the ultimate package - priced at $100,000 (£66,000).

It includes a stay in the palatial Presidential Suite, three hours of personal shopping and a clothing allowance of $3,000 per person.

All packages offer a 60- or 90-minute couples massage at the hotel's famed Spa at the Regent Beverly Wilshire

Just like in the film, you and your love will be able to head for a romantic picnic at the Greystone Manor - complete with limo transfer 

All couples will be given a lovely dinner and the chance to experience a cultural 'date night' activity out in Los Angeles

Additionally, the lunch picnic with a limo ride gets a makeover too. Guests will have the option to choose from a Rolls-Royce or Bentley for a five-hour getaway, complete with a musical serenade.

During a romantic dinner on the Veranda Suite terrace, celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck will make a personal appearance and couples will receive a 'diamond manicure and pedicure' as well as a 90-minute couples massage.

However, coming in at $100,000, you just may need your own 'corporate raider' to be able to afford it.
