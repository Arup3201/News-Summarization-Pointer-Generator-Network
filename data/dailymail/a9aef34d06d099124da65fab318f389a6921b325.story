Tragic: Polly Kitzinger was left severely brain damaged after she was injured in a car crash in March 2009

The sisters of a woman left severely brain damaged after she was injured in a car crash have published a study calling for patients in a vegetative state to be allowed to die.

Celia and Jenny Kitzinger were devastated when their sister Polly was involved in the crash in March 2009.

Five years on Polly, now 52, has emerged from a coma but remains with permanent and profound mental and physical disabilities.

Although the sisters handed doctors a 100-page dossier outlining fiercly independent mental health advocate Polly's wishes not to be kept alive, including her own notes and testimonies from family and friends, they were legally unable to have her treatment stopped.

Now Celia and Jenny, who are both 
university professors, have published research declaring that other 
families of severely brain damaged patients believe that when all other 
avenues have been exhausted, terminal sedation is a humane option.

Jenny, a professor in the School of Journalism, Media and Cultural 
Studies at Cardiff University and Celia, sociology professor at the 
University of York, hope their research, published in the respected 
Journal of Medical Ethics, will help inform debate about ways 
of dying when people become catastrophically disabled through illness or
 injury.

'Often family members want to speak publicly about this but 
it’s taboo for them to say they wished their loved one was dead or would
 want to be dead,' Jenny said.

'Polly, who very much believed in 
people being able to make their own health choices, had a car crash and 
now lives life in a coma.

'It is a very, very cruel irony.

'She’s trapped and could live like this for another 25 years. I know it’s not what she would want.'

Trapped: Polly's sisters have said she is 'trapped' due to her severe mental and physical disabilities, and believe she should be allowed to die

Prior to the accident, Polly, now 52, was a mental health user involvement 
officer at Interlink Rhondda Cynon Taf and was returning from a work 
conference when she was involved in the car crash near Brecon, Wales.

Having suffered multiple fractures and profound brain 
injury, she was kept breathing on a ventilator as she was rushed to the 
University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.

Soon afterwards, the family was told 
the prognosis was grim and although Polly now has some minimal 
consciousness having emerged from her coma, she has permanent mental and physical disabilities and will always need 
round-the-clock care.

Her
 sisters, daughters of acclaimed birth rights writer and campaigner Dr 
Sheila Kitzinger, talked about dying before the accident and say they 
have no doubt their younger sister, who lived in Brecon, would not want 
to be kept alive.

'We’d
 discussed as a family what we’d each want if we lost capacity to make 
decisions and mother and I had written living wills,' said Jenny, who is
 in her .

'You can download 
forms on informed consent and living wills. When I cleared Polly’s house
 in Brecon I found an empty form from Compassion in Dying, she’d never 
filled it in. I wept. How many of us find time to do it?'

'It feels very cruel for Polly that she is kept alive against her wishes.

'After her accident we discovered next of kin have no legal right to take decisions.”

Jenny, who lives in Penarth, said Polly was a lively, fearless woman who enjoyed sailing and gardening and had strong views on patient rights and disability rights.

She hopes the study, Withdrawing Artificial Nutrition and Hydration from Minimally Conscious and Vegetative Patients: Family Perspectives research, will help raise awareness of the issue.

Speaking to 51 relatives of patients in a vegetative or minimally conscious state, the sisters found two thirds believed their relative would rather be dead than stay alive in that condition, but less would consider applying to halt artificial feeding and hydration to allow death.

Some told them euthanasia by sedation was preferable to withholding or withdrawing treatment.

Currently, halting treatment is the only legal method guaranteed to allow death in patients in a vegetative state.

'At the moment it is legal to allow people to die by withdrawing artificial nutrition and hydration, but that can mean watching a long, slow death which many relatives just cannot bear the thought of,' explained Celia.

'There must be a more merciful way of allowing people to die.'

'If a court is going to take a decision to allow someone to die, why not do it in a way that’s less prolonged for the patient?

'There must be a more merciful way of allowing people to die.

'The lived reality of the families facing these decisions should be taken into account and other ways of bringing about the death of severely brain damaged patients should be given full ethical consideration.”

The sisters, who are co-directors of the York-Cardiff Chronic Disorders of Consciousness Research Centre (CDoC) which explores the social and ethical challenges of the vegetative and minimally conscious state, say relatives’ views should be given ethical consideration in legal and medical debates on treatment options.

Their work has also informed a leaflet for families to help them represent their loved one and Jenny organised a Before I Die festival in Cardiff last May to encourage people to discuss their end-of-life wishes.

The Cardiff academic also spoke at the launch of the new Royal College of Physicians national clinical guidelines on 'Prolonged Disorders Of Consciousness' last month.

'We are trying to honour Polly’s values and beliefs in the ways that we can,' said Jenny.

'I hope our research means that Polly’s legacy lives on.'
