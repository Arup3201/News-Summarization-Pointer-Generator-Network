Midfielder Sandro believes the arrival of a new manager in the summer could reignite his Tottenham career.

The 25-year-old has struggled to re-establish himself in Spurs' midfield in the second half of the season after suffering a calf injury in December, and was labelled 'not up to it at the moment ahead of other people' by boss Tim Sherwood after being overlooked for the April 19 game against Fulham.

Sherwood has opted to use Paulinho as his main defensive option in the middle of the park - leaving Sandro out of the first-team picture - but the Brazil international hopes the seemingly likely departure of Sherwood at the end of the campaign could rejuvenate his prospects in north London.

Chance to reignite: Sandro is relishing a new manager to replace Tim Sherwood at Totteham Hotspur

And he's off! Sherwood is widely expected to leave White Hart Lane at the end of the season

'He (Sherwood) will leave at the end of the season,' Sandro told ESPN Brazil. 'Then, new coach, new everything.'

Sherwood was handed an 18-month contract when he succeeded Andre Villas-Boas in December, but that has not prevented reports he will be shown the door at the end of the term, with the likes of Frank de Boer and Mauricio Pochettino touted for the role.

Sandro, who has been linked with a transfer to Sao Paulo, is unsure what his own future holds, but says a switch back to his homeland would be difficult given Tottenham's valuation of him.

'I do not know anything yet (about my future), but I'm happy to have my name talked about with a club the size of Sao Paulo,' he said.

'(But) it would be very difficult to leave on loan. If I leave, I would have to be sold, and it is not close. Other teams have come, but with little money.'

On the radar: Spurs are keen on Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino to take over

Sherwood has played down talk of bad blood between the pair, stemming from the player tweeting to tell fans he was not injured on the morning of the Fulham game.

'He's not injured, and he's fit to play, but he's not selected because he's not up to it at the moment ahead of other people,' the 45-year-old said after the 3-1 triumph.

'I really don't have a problem with him. He's a good lad. I don't have any problem with anything he's got to say. He's not being disrespectful to me, I don't think.'
