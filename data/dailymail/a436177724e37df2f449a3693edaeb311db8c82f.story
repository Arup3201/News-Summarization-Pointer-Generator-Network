Gary Glitter was yesterday charged with eight sexual offences against under-age girls more than three decades ago.

The former singer is alleged to have molested two girls, one of whom was no more than 13, over three years.

The offences are alleged to have taken place in the late 1970s when the glam rocker’s career was already in decline.

Gary Glitter has been charged with eight sexual offences relating to 
girls aged between 12 and 14, the Crown Prosecution Service said

The alleged offences are said to have taken place between 1977 and 1980, when the singer's career was already in decline

Now aged 70 and in poor health, Glitter was told by prosecutors that he faces trial.

In
 a statement, the Crown Prosecution Service said the first victim, who 
was aged 12 or 13, claims Glitter had sex with her, indecently assaulted
 her and drugged her for sex in 1977.

The second, who was aged 13 or 14, accuses Glitter of indecently assaulting her between late 1979 and the end of 1980.

Scotland
 Yard and prosecutors have been exchanging evidence since July last 
year, with the most recent material submitted in March.

Baljit Ubhey,
 CPS chief crown prosecutor for London, said five further allegations 
made by two other women had been dropped because there was ‘insufficient
 evidence’.

Glitter was the first suspect to be arrested by Scotland
 Yard’s Operation Yewtree in 2012, the investigation set up after Jimmy 
Savile was exposed as a prolific paedophile.

The pop star - real name Paul Gadd - is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on June 19

Since his arrest, 
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, has kept a low profile at his £1.2million 
apartment in London’s fashionable Marylebone district.

He has been re-bailed at least  five times as more than a dozen other celebrities were arrested by Yewtree detectives.

The decision to charge Glitter leaves only a handful of Yewtree  suspects on bail, including BBC DJ Paul Gambaccini.

Former
 Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning was charged last month with 41 offences, 
including 34 counts of indecent assault. The allegations dated from 
between 1967 and 1985.

Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck was arrested and spent 
nearly a year on bail before being told he would not face charges. 
Fellow comic Jim Davidson will also face no further action.

DJ Mike 
Osman and former BBC producers Wilfred De’Ath and Ted Beston were also 
arrested and later told they would not be charged.

Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis was cleared by a jury of 12 sex attacks, although he still faces three charges.

Glitter will appear at Westminster magistrates’ court on June 19..
