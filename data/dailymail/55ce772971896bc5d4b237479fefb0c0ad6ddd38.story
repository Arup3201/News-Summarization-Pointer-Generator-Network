Ultra cost-cutter Ryanair wants to widen its doors in yet another scheme to make themselves cash.

The Dublin-based airline says allowing people to get on or off in twos could boost their profits as it would speed-up their turnaround at airports.

Ryanair's outspoken boss Michael O'Leary is famous for his cost-cutting ideas, including charging £1 to use the toilet or even offering standing tickets on flights.

Now Mr O'Leary is in talks with a Chinese company to help him herd passengers on and off in record times.

Good things come in twos: Ryanair wants to get people on and off quicker by widening its doors

The state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China is already considering putting a prototype together for them.

'The Chinese are willing to listen to what we want,' Ryanair’s chief financial officer, Howard Millar said.

Full of ideas: Ryanair's boss Michael O'Leary has considered many extrovert plans to make more money

'A plane manufactured by Boeing or Airbus is a one-size-fits-all. We want two people to walk through the door.'

It came as last night Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary said he was upset he could not charge more for tickets, as profits fell by almost a third.

'We’re always trying to increase fares, but this time demand doesn’t allow it,' he said.

He added that austerity and European economic woes would ‘restrain fare growth’ going into next winter.

Lower demand for air travel by hard-pressed passengers was also keeping prices down, he said.

He blamed the 28 per cent fall in underlying pre-tax profits to £88million on the rising costs of aircraft fuel.

The amount the company pays for its fuel has risen by 27 per cent in the last year, he said, and now makes up almost half of total operating costs.

But it transpired that the airline had locked itself into paying a higher price for the fuel, after striking a deal.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary's plan for wider doors is the latest scheme from the budget airline. Some have been implemented, while others have not.

They include...

Last year it paid the equivalent of 
$82 a barrel for the fuel, but this year is shelling out between $100 
and $104 – more than it would be paying on the open market.

The deal means Ryanair will pay out 
the higher amount until March next year, but O’Leary said it was worth 
it for the certainty on costs.

Profits between April and June fell by 28 per cent to £88million, while passenger numbers increased by 6 per cent to 22.5million.

Revenues, which rose 11 per cent to
£1billion, were held back by ‘heavily discounted fares’ from some of 
Ryanair’s regional British airports and a number of its continental 
destinations.

But the airline has often been accused of adding on additional and hidden charges in the past.

O’Leary said the summer’s trading was
still poor, with Europeans being put off by high prices and many Brits 
choosing to stay at home to watch the Olympics.

He refused to comment on Ryanair’s offer for Aer Lingus, which is currently being assessed by European competition authorities.

Shares, which are up 25 per cent in the last 12 months, rose 8.8c to close at €4.
