But although the venue for the traditional clash between the Champions League and Europa League winners has shifted from the glamour of Monaco to the unfamiliar surroundings of Cardiff - it will feel like home to some.

Gareth Bale arrived with his fellow Madrid team-mates at Cardiff airport on Monday, as the Welshman touched down on home territory following the flight from the Spanish capital.

Real clinched their 10th European Cup in dramatic fashion in May, beating city rivals Atletico Madrid 4-1 after extra-time.

Ahead of Tuesday's Super Cup, Madrid's Alvaro Arbeloa is confident his side can make it number 11 in Berlin next year.

The 31-year-old told the Real Madrid website: 'It is true that we were in search of that title for a long time. We knew what it meant, not just for the club but for our fans, and sharing that joy with them is something we will never forget.

'Real Madrid's prestige has always been a result of its victories in Europe. For this club and for these players it is very important that we have the chance to fight for a European title and to win it.'
