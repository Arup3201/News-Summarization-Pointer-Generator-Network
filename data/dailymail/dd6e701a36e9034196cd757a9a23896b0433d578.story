Sportsmail’s Martin Keown has hailed Mesut Ozil’s return to form for Arsenal after the German playmaker inspired the Gunners to a 3-0 victory at Aston Villa on Saturday.

The German international had started the season in dismal form, mainly playing out on the left, which was compounded by his dreadful showing against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday.

Ozil, the £42million club record signing, returned to his preferred central role where he played for the majority of his time at Real Madrid, and responded to calls that he should be dropped with his best performance for some considerable time.

Martin Keown lauded Ozil's 'magnificent' Arsenal performance which inspired the Gunners to victory

The former Arsenal defender noticed a difference in Ozil with team mate Alexis Sanchez on the bench

‘With Alexis Sanchez not playing, the team was dancing for his boots. Sanchez will obviously come back in at some point but Ozil was magnificent in the central role today,’ said Keown as a pundit on Match of the Day.

‘Ozil was magnificent in the central role, he pressed all the right buttons and orchestrated all of Arsenal’s best attacks,’ added Keown.

His creativity was most potent in a concentrated burst of three minutes when Arsenal scored the goals to win this game but throughout the match he showed his true class. 

Mesut Ozil put in an outstanding performance against Aston Villa in a central role to silence his recent critics 

‘His goal was a consequence of brilliant play, he was really calm as he slotted it home into the corner.

‘There was an ease to his play as the number 10, he was energised in the centre and looked like he wanted to go forward all the time which would have pleased Arsene Wenger,’said Keown.

Arsenal manager then faces a conundrum whether to keep Ozil in the centre, espcecially with a plethora of attacking midfield options at his disposal.

However Wenger will be delighted with Ozil’s fine but prolonged return to form.
