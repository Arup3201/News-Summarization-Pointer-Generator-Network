Accused 'fan', Nedal Lakmas (above) covers his face as he leaves the Sydney court where he faced a charge of indecently assaulting Modern Family star, Sarah Hyland, at a party last month. Lakmas applied to the court to have the charge heard under the Mental Health Act next month

Lakmas, 29, is charged with indecently assaulting Ms Hyland at a party for her hit show hosted by Qantas at The Sebel Pier One.

The 23-year-old actress had been posing for photographs at the event on February 20 when she was allegedly touched inappropriately by Lakmas.

Ms Hyland reportedly fled the event in tears. Eight days later, she left Australia for Los Angeles after a two-week stay in which the Modern Family cast filmed on Bondi Beach.

The case is now likely to be handled under a section of the Mental Health Act of NSW, which allows for the defendant to undergo a treatment plan for mental health issues.

Lakmas will return to court on April 11.
