Education officials are hoping it is third time lucky as
they try to get rid of a school teacher accused of sexual misconduct.

Jonathan Polayes, 60, has taught at New York city schools
for the past 22 years, racking up a multitude of accusations that he groped
girls and made lewd comments about their breasts, thighs and bottoms.

But despite his sordid history the veteran teacher has
avoided being fired from his $95,000-a-year position.

Accusations: Three separate investigations found a sickening pattern of Polayes hugging, tickling and harassing female students at schools in Manhattan and the Bronx

In a review of misconduct cases since 2000 carried out by Chancellor
Dennis Walcott, Polayes was one of eight staffers singled out for his repeat offending.

Three separate investigations found a sickening pattern of
the social studies teacher hugging, tickling and harassing female students at
schools in Manhattan and the Bronx.

The incidents date back to 1994, when the assistant principal at Chelsea Career and Technical High School warned him not to touch female students and was later caught remarking on the size of girls’ breasts.

Now the Education Department is hoping to finally get rid of
him.

According to investigators, he’s been accused of hugging
students, of sliding a hand down a girl’s back and saying her thighs were
getting smaller, of tickling the waist of an 11-year-old; palming a girl’s legs
and calling her ‘Tiny’, and of touching another student’s buttocks.

Two arbitrators didn’t find Polayes guilty of ‘sexual
misconduct’, which carries with it automatic firing, but they did determine he
hugged two kids, tickled another and touched a girl’s leg in a way that made
her feel ‘uncomfortable’.

On both occasions Polayses was suspended but his
investigators say his behaviour continued after returning to work.

General counsel Michael Best told the New York Daily News:
‘We’re unhappy to look back and see decisions where arbitrators are deciding
the people can stay in the classroom even though they’ve done something that's
inappropriate.’

Polayes, who has been assigned to desk duty since March 2,
called the agency’s attempts to can him a ‘witch hunt’.

‘The (Education Department) dropped charges, dismissed
charges, whatever term you want applies,’ he said from his Connecticut home.

‘And now they’re digging it up again. What does that tell
you? ... And right now they’re digging up things that they themselves proved
weren’t true.’

United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew said
he supported a ‘zero-tolerance policy’ for sexual misconduct.

‘It is up to the (Education Department) to use its powers
and its hundreds of lawyers and investigators to manage this process
effectively,’ he said.

But Chancellor Walcott said that officials have their hands tied,
adding that the city would like to fire as many as 20 other teachers and
teaching assistants still working in the system.

‘This is in the hands, unfortunately, of an arbitrator,’ he
said. ‘I would like to have the ability in these type of cases especially to be
the final decision maker. We look forward to working with the UFT around that.’
