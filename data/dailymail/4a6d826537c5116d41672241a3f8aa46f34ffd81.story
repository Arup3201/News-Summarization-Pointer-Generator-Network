If you're more familiar with the well-endowed end of the underwear alphabet, wearing a bra that doesn't feel as thought it belongs to your grandmother might seem like an impossible dream.

But a new fashion which allows big-bosomed ladies to wear more glamorous underwear is sweeping the high street - meaning larger bras no longer have to feel as though they are reinforced with iron.

The trend hit the M&S lingerie laboratory earlier this summer, when experts unveiled a new non-wired bra for those with DD cups and larger.

M&S is just one of the high street chains which is branching out in its range of larger bras, allowing women with bigger breasts to wear the more luxurious bras usually reserved for small cup sizes. Pictured: An example from their DD+ range

Triumph has also created an innovative bra from those with larger assets, which uses silicone for uplift, instead of wire. Wonderbra, another popular underwear company, has also started selling strapless bras - previously only for those with petite breasts - up to a G cup.

And, according to the statistics, it's about time. According to The Times, In the past ten years alone, the average bra size in the UK has increased from a 34B to a 36C.

Amy Debenham-Evans, 
lingerie merchandiser at Figleaves, added that the DD+ 
business is worth 80 per more than the core size business of cups AA to D.

Harlow & Fox was set up in 2011 specifically to 
provide more luxurious bras for DD to G cups, while high street brands such as Elle Macpherson and 
Agent Provocateur have since followed suit.

The prominence of celebrities such as Kelly Brook in glossy magazines means bigger breasts are being celebrated

And, with the likes of Kelly Brook and other celebrities with larger breasts often being featured in glossy magazines, it seems larger boobs are having something of a Renaissance.

According to M&S, the new range of non-wired bra uses 'compressed cup technology' which means the foam cups are specially moulded to give compression in the right places.

It also includes a supportive cradle to help keep the bra in place - without having the usual, somewhat unflattering, two-inch straps.

The designs include lace and silk, previously reserved for bras with a smaller cup size.

Soozie Jenkinson, head of lingerie design
 for M&S, said it was a beautiful design which still delivered on great shape definition and support.

Meanwhile, Triumph's new bra with silicone - complete with animal print fabric and padded cups - gives the shape and 
uplift of an underwired bra.

Julia 
Mercer, Triumph's bra fit expert, told The Times that the tide was turning because the average bra size sold by the company in M&S had increased from a 34B to a 36D.

She said it was partly due to less active lifestyles, but also because so many people had previously worn the wrong-sized bra.
