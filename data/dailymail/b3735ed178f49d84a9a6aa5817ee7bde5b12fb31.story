How did the heron cross the river? On its hippo friend's back of course! 

A visitor at the Kruger National Park in South Africa filmed the unlikely duo in action.

The long-legged bird is seen surfing downstream, while its large pal paddles underwater.

At one point, the hippo raises its head for air. 

In then dips down again, to keep the ship sailing.

The heron doesn't move a muscle as it is chauffeured along. 

To date the video of the 'surfing' bird has been watched more than 34,000 times.

Some viewers have said that they've seen similar river cruising antics at the park.
