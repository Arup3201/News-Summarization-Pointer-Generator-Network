The Lord Mayor of London's 17th century country mansion where Samuel Pepys was invited for dinner has been put on the market for £45million - but it still needs another £10million to turn it into a home.

Swakeleys House, a Grade I listed Jacobean building set among 25 acres, was originally built for Sir Edmund Wright as a palatial retreat within easy reach of the City of London.

It was later acquired by another wealthy businessman, Sir Robert Vyner, who invited the famous diarist Samuel Pepys to dinner. He described the grand property in Ickenham, Middlesex, as 'a very pleasant place'.

Swakeleys House, a Grade I listed Jacobean building set in 25 acres of land, was originally built for Sir Edmund Wright as a palatial retreat

Wright, a successful merchant, bought the estate in Ickenham, Middlesex in 1629 and commissioned the grand, H-shaped Jacobean mansion

But the 20,000sq ft property has not been used as a residence for more than 80 years. It now has planning permission to be turned into one of the country's finest family homes - if the prospective buyer pumps in millions of pounds of repairs. 

When restored, the fixer-upper could boast 23 en-suite bedrooms, along with a party pavilion for 200 guests. There will also be a separate 22,000sq ft office building.

Wright, a successful merchant, bought the estate in 1629, before becoming the Lord Mayor of London in 1940. After buying the land, he commissioned the grand, H-shaped mansion but it took nine years to complete.

The property was inherited by Wright's daughter Katherine, who then sold it to the rich financier, Sir Robert. 

In the diary entry written by Pepys, he described the property as 'not very modern' but with 'some things to excess'.

He wrote: 'It is a place not very modern in the garden nor house, but the most uniform in all that ever I saw; and some things to excess. 

The property was later acquired by businessman, Sir Robert Vyner, who invited the famous diarist to dinner. He described it as 'very pleasant'

Despite being located inside the M25 and within a 20-minute drive of central London, Swakeleys House has 25 acres of private garden

The property could be one of the capital's most impressive private homes, but will need around £10 million spent to get it into shape

The screen in the property's great hall, which boasts crests of arms, was installed by Sir James Harington, the husband of Sir Edmund’s daughter, Katherine. Pepys wrote about the screen in his diary when he visited the palace to dine with Sir Robert Vyner 

'The window-cases, door-cases, and chimneys of all the house are marble.. and after dinner Sir Robert led us up to his long gallery, very fine, above stairs (and better, or such, furniture I never did see).'

He also commented on the Harington screen, which was installed in the mansion's great hall by Sir James Harington, the husband of Sir Edmund's daughter Katherine.

He wrote: 'Pretty to see over the screen of the hall (put up by Sir J. Harington, a Long Parliament man) the King’s head, and my Lord of Essex on one side, and Fairfax on the other; and upon the other side of the screen, the parson of the parish, and the lord of the manor and his sisters.'

When Sir Robert died, the property was passed through his family, before being acquired by Reverend Thomas Clarke in 1750, in whose family it remained until 1923. 

That year, the property was taken over by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office, which sold it in 1955.

Since then, the ownership of the property has been unclear, although its current owner is thought to be a Briton living abroad. It has mainly been used for offices. 

Despite being located inside the M25 and within a 20-minute drive of central London, Swakeleys House has 25 acres of private garden.

The advert also describes the property as being 'Built for a Lord Mayor of London' and 'Fit for a King'.

English Heritage describe the home as an 'important example of artisan mannerism'. 

Once the restoration is complete, the main property would feature a great hall, family dining, sitting and breakfast rooms, as well as a kitchen, study and music room.

The estate will also feature a stable block with a long gallery, family room, library and dog wash facilities. There will be numerous detached, single storey buildings with guest accommodation.

Despite the eye-watering price-tag, it is thought there has been plenty of interest, particularly from the Middle East and Asia. 

Henry Pryor, who helps the wealthy buy property, said: 'It is very rare but not unheard of for properties like this to come to the market.

'25 acres within the M25 is very unusual indeed and must contribute a great deal to the agent's guide price believed to be around £45m.

'The distant drone of the A40, the planes landing at Northolt would put most of my clients off but there may be an ego to whom the house appeals.'

Charles Godfrey, a partner at the agency GN2, which is selling Swakeleys House, described the estate as one of London's best kept secrets.

He said: 'It is an incredible place and, in total, has around 70,000sq ft of space as well as 25 acres of land.

'The property is a very well kept secret. The amount of times I've driven past and not know it is there.

'It is one of only a few buildings which has a royal crest of arms and is insured for north for £50 million. It is also in a good condition.

'Like many buildings of its type, it has been used for offices. However, it now has planning permission for the main house to be restored to its former glory.

'The new construction will have the spa, guest accommodation and an indoor and outdoor swimming pool.

'We have had a lot of interest in it particularly from the Middle-East and Asia. It is one of London's great assets.'
