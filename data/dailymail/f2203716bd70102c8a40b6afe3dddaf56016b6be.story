West Ham installed a ring of extra security around Sam Allardyce during a torrid period for the Hammers boss last season.

Sportsmail can reveal that with home fans turning against their unpopular supremo as his side languished in the lower reaches of the Premier League, the club beefed-up security around the home dugout.

A stadium management briefing before the Hammers’ home clash with Sunderland on December 13, 2013, reveals that Allardyce had complained to staff about foul and abusive language aimed at him and his players from around the bench area.

West Ham employed six security staff at the Boleyn Ground to eject fans abusing manager Sam Allardyce

Hammers fans hold up a banner in April last year asking for Allardyce's time at West Ham to come to an end 

The club employed three staff to sit either side of Allardyce with strict instructions to eject any abusive fans

It adds that, as a result, stadium management decided to bring in six extra security personnel and ‘eject if needed’.

The briefing tells stewards: ‘The manager has complained about foul and abusive language aimed at him and our players from around the dugout area. For all matches we have employed 6 extra security personnel from Jumbo who will sit 3 either side and eject if needed. THERE ARE TO BE NO WARNINGS JUST EJECTIONS’

It also states that one supporter has already been thrown out for such behaviour.

The message ends: ‘THIS MUST BE STRICTLY ENFORCED ESPECIALLY FOR TODAY’S MATCH AS GIVEN THE WRONG RESULT WE COULD BE IN THE BOTTOM 3’.

An uninspiring 0-0 draw against the bottom-of-the-table Black Cats was enough to keep Allardyce’s men outside the drop zone.

Two months later, Swansea City were the visitors on February 1.

The tables have turned for the 60-year-old as he has guided the Hammers to seventh in the Premier League

With the Hammers now in the bottom three, the safety briefing sent out a similar message and added that the extra security was still in place if needed.

But the home side, inspired by two goals from Kevin Nolan, won 2-0 and there were no incidents against Allardyce in a match which signalled the end of his opposite manager Michael Laudrup’s tenure at the Swans.

West Ham stuck by Allardyce, went on to avoid the drop and after a successful summer in the transfer market are now in a position to challenge for a place in Europe.

The high-flying Hammers declined to say whether the extra measures were still in place but it is thought to be unlikely.

A West Ham source said: ‘A message in every matchday programme states the use of threatening behaviour, foul or abusive language is strictly forbidden in any part of the stadium and will result in arrest and/or ejection from the stadium. The Club want all supporters to be able to enjoy watching West Ham in a safe and secure environment.’
