Sir Alex Ferguson has broken his silence over Louis van Gaal’s modern Manchester United by predicting his old team will become a force in the Barclays Premier League in the new year.

Ferguson has largely watched from afar as Van Gaal and his injury-hit squad have struggled to keep up with Chelsea and Manchester City at the top of the table.

But now Ferguson has backed Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney to propel United’s charge. ‘First of all, Louis van Gaal,’ said the former Old Trafford  boss. ‘I don’t know how he can expect to get the best results with the number of injuries he has had. When he gets the best players back — you watch United. He is a great coach and will do well.

‘Michael Carrick is the best English player in the game. Robin van Persie, the World Cup maybe has taken a little bit out of him, but you watch him in the second half of the season. He’ll be fine. Rooney is flying again and will always get you a goal.’

Sir Alex, who was speaking to Clare Balding for a BT Sport Christmas Day special, also addressed the issue of United’s new players and one of his own best recent signings, keeper David de Gea.

‘I’m not interested in what is happening with the players they have brought in because they need time,’ he said.

‘When I took Patrice Evra and Nemanja Vidic in January of the same year they were all over the place. They took five months to get used to playing for Manchester United — the culture, the history of the club — and these new players will be exactly the same.

‘The one that is most pleasing for me of the present lot is David de Gea. When we bought him as a kid, he was frail, but he had ability. He has special talents and he is showing that now. I’m really pleased for that kid.’

City and Chelsea are title favourites and if Ferguson could pick a winner it would be the Londoners, not just because of United’s rivalry with City but due to his friendship with Jose Mourinho.

Ferguson added: ‘It is unfair really. He’s good-looking, he has the George Clooney bits in his hair. But he is a great example. He is learning all the time, he has a determination.’

Ferguson perhaps found his match in Mourinho when it came to mind games and the Scot revealed his famous habit of looking at his watch late in games was a con trick.

Asked if the ‘Fergie time’ act intimidated rivals, he said: ‘Absolutely. That’s why I used to go with my watch. I never looked at it. Honestly. But it gets across to the opponents and the referee. It was just a little trick.’

Sir Alex Ferguson was speaking to Clare Balding as part of a BT Sport Christmas Day double-bill of ‘Clare Balding Meets’ which features exclusive interviews with Sir Alex and Jose Mourinho. Watch the full interviews on BT Sport 1 from 3.30pm.
