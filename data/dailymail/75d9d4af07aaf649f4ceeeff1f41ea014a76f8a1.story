A comic novel about Adolf Hitler falling asleep in 1945 and waking up in Berlin in 2011 has stormed to the top of the bestseller lists in Germany.

Some 250,000 copies of Timur Vermes’ Er Ist Wieder Da, translated as He’s Back, have been sold, along with 75,000 audiobooks.

An English language version is expected to be released in British shops soon.

Chart: Timur Vermes' Er Ist Wieder Da has sold 250,000 copies, making it Germany's bestseller

A former journalist with a German mother and Hungarian father, Vermes has helped to stoke a debate over rising neo-Nazism, disillusion with a failing currency and fears of inflation – the same toxic mix which enabled Hitler to come to power in the 1930s.

Some have seen its success as proof that the guilt-ridden postwar generation has given way to one able to laugh at the monster who still haunts them.

The book hit the hardcover number one slot in fiction, beating Ken Follet’s Winter Of The World into second place, after being released in September.

Reviewers are divided between whether readers are laughing at Hitler, with him - or at themselves.

So far 17 foreign licences for it have been issued and Vermes is likely to become a millionaire out of his parody on a subject unthinkable for Germans just a few short years ago; treating the architect of WW2 and the Jewish Holocaust as a figure of fun.

Farcical: The novel follows Hitler in 2011 when he expects to find Berlin swarming with Russian soldiers

The plot is farcical. The once mighty Fuehrer does not die in the Berlin bunker at the end of WW2 but wakes after a long sleep on a plot of wasteland in a capital he expects to find swarming with occupying Russian soldiers.

He wanders the streets until a newsagent takes pity on him and lets him sleep in his kiosk and, while people obviously recognise Hitler, they assume he is a comedian playing a role.

His unintentionally hilarious monologues spark amusement and he is given a guest slot on the show of a Turkish-born comedy star, Ali Wizgür, and instantly drives ups the ratings.

There follows stardom on YouTube and, after winning the backing of a tabloid newspaper, he goes into politics, whipping up hatred against speeding drivers and dog-fouled pavements.

The cover of the book has a blank white space showing Hitler’s familiar haircut with the book title condensed to form his toothbrush moustache.

The author said he wanted to use a comic theme to portray the 'real Hitler - certainly megalomaniacal and deeply disturbed, but also charming, polite and flexible.

'There are people who would like a comfortable monster so they can shift the blame.'
