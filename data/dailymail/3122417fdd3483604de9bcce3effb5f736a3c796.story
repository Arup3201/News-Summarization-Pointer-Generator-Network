Casually sipping a juice drink – with his high-visibility vest beside him on a table – a police officer chats to a colleague in the cafe of a health food store. 

It is in a burglary hot spot and a short distance from the scene of the 2011 Tottenham riots.

But they are not two constables taking a break after pounding the beat. They are sitting in what passes for a police station in the constituency of Crime Prevention Minister Lynne Featherstone.

Last week the delighted Liberal Democrat MP announced the opening of the police 'contact point' in her local branch of Planet Organic as 'great news'.

Planet Organic Store in Muswell Hill, north London, is now a police contact point where the public can meet officers and report crimes

It is intended to replace the police station in Muswell Hill, which closed in 2013 after more than a century of service to the community. 

The new facility is supposed to offer all the services that would normally be provided by a police station, including receiving crime reports, giving advice to victims, processing witness statements and handling driving licences and insurance documents provided by motorists after accidents.

But when The Mail on Sunday reporters observed the 'contact point' over two evenings last week, the police officers had no desk, no private area where they could speak to members of the public in confidence, no means of logging on to the police national computer, and they appeared not to have official forms.

In the entire time the officers were there, not one offence was reported to them. Their only 'customer' during the first two-hour session was a passer-by who recognised one of the PCs from a dog-attack inquiry a year ago and popped in for a chat.

As she left the store, the woman remarked to her husband: 'If they spent two hours walking the streets it might be more useful.'

This is the reality of policing in 2015 as forces struggle to cope with a 20 per cent budget cut imposed by Home Secretary Theresa May.

Hundreds of police stations have closed, with the public offered a part-time service – dismissed by critics as a 'cops in shops' gimmick.

The officers deployed at the Muswell Hill branch of Planet Organic relieved their boredom by perusing the shelves of antioxidant vegetable juice, vegan tofu and sea salt bathing crystals, or trying out the store's 'reverse osmosis de-ionising' water filter.

One told an undercover reporter: 'If we weren't here, we would either be on the beat or visiting people at home, following up crime incidents that have been reported.'

The contact point is open on Wednesdays and Thursdays between 6pm and 8pm, and on Saturdays between 1pm and 3pm. Campaigners say it should be a matter of shame for Ministers that the local police station, which closed two years ago and is being sold to developers, has been replaced by two PCs occupying borrowed space in the high street for just six hours a week.

To give Ms Featherstone credit, she campaigned vigorously against the closure. But in her message to constituents last week, she welcomed the latest development as a victory.

'Residents will once again have a local contact point where they can meet local police and trained volunteers, and among other things will be able to report crimes, get crime prevention advice and hand in or collect lost property,' she wrote.

However, an investigation by The Mail on Sunday has exposed her claims about the service now offered as wildly unrealistic.

Undercover reporters who watched the police deployment at Planet Organic on Wednesday and Thursday found the scheme to be badly organised and virtually useless in terms of combating crime.

There was no Metropolitan Police logo on display outside the store, and the only indication that the premises had been designated a 'contact point' was a small notice posted above head height just inside the entrance.

No senior police officers were present and the shop seemed unprepared for the constables' arrival, leaving them in the embarrassing position of having to ask the store manager where they should sit.

John Hajdu, chairman of the 700-member Muswell Hill and Fortis Green Association, said: 'It looked like they were two policemen on their break. There has been virtually no publicity. A proper service should have been put in place, not this sort of half-hearted measure.'

On Thursday evening – the second day of the initiative – the officers brought crime prevention leaflets which they laid out on a table. None was taken. Store manager Amit Fridman said: 'I'm quite happy to have them here – it deters shoplifters.'

Crime in the area has increased and the nearest 24-hour police station is four miles away. There is one closer, but it shuts on Sundays and Mondays, and after 6pm. Official figures for Haringey borough, which includes Muswell Hill, show violent crime in 2014 rose from 4,514 offences in the previous 12 months to 6,296; rape cases from 135 to 180; robbery from 926 to 1,019; and domestic burglary from 1,979 to 2,180.

The Mail on Sunday visited a similar initiative in East London last week. There a uniformed police officer sat for an hour in a Costa Coffee outlet at a Tesco supermarket in Leytonstone without speaking to anyone for the entire time.

He had to leave an hour before his shift was due to end when the cafe closed for the night. The three-times-a-week service has been operating since the local police station closed last October.

West Yorkshire Police advertises a 'cuppa with a copper' at a cafe in Leeds. But critics say it is wrong to expect a woman who, for example, has been sexually assaulted to tell a police officer or volunteer about her ordeal in a coffee shop, where others may overhear, and there are no support services on site.

A police review of the 'contact point' scheme last year found that makeshift police desks in supermarkets, libraries and community centres were being used by an average of just one person a week and failed to offer good value for money.

Figures from the watchdog, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, show that in 2009-10, there were 1,218 police counters across England and Wales where people could report crime. By the end of next month, 264 are due to be shut down.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'We remain committed to the delivery of contact points as part of our Wider Access strategy.'

A spokesman for Ms Featherstone said: 'We will continue to work with police to ensure the service is helpful and effective for residents.'

The closure of disused local ‘nicks’ may be bad for victims of crime but has been welcomed by imaginative developers.

In Cumbria, Egremont police station is being turned into a hostel for the homeless – and given more than £100,000 by the Police and Crime Commissioner, who is at the same time cutting back on officers.

The Boutique Spa in Kent has two branches, at Orpington and Beckenham, based in former police stations. Owner Rachael Polyviou said: ‘They are just really attractive old buildings.’

Demolition work recently began on a large police HQ in Leeds that is to become a branch of supermarket Aldi. And in the Bristol suburb of Redlands a Victorian police station is now an infants school. Architects kept white-tiled cells in the basement and turned them into a library.

Overall, one in five police stations has been closed to the public since the last Election.
