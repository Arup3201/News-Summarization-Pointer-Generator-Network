A five-year-old Ohio girl died Wednesday after she tried to get out of a moving Jeep, authorities said.

Cameron Laughlin was with a three-year-old child in the parked car, the Stark County Sheriff's Office said in a release.

However, the Jeep went into the neutral position and went out of the driveway into a ditch, authorities said.

Victim: Cameron Laughlin, 5, was killed as she tried to get out of the moving Jeep

'Laughlin [...] was struck by the vehicle while attempting to exit,' the Stark County Sheriff's Office said.

Laughlin later died at an Alliance hospital, authorities said.

The sheriff's office did not say where any adults were at the time of the incident.

'It appears the car door struck her and knocked her down, and the car then ran over her,' Sheriff George Maier told Ohio.com.

'The children were playing in the car, we are still investigating this, but for whatever reason the 2007 Jeep Liberty coasted backwards going east from the residence out of the driveway across the road and struck a ditch on the east side,' Maier also said.

A mother's love: Cameron's mother Melissa Laughlin has said 'She was always a happy little girl'

The car involved in the accident belongs to Laughlin's aunt, CantonRep.com reported.

'She was always a happy little girl,‚Äù mother Melissa Laughlin told the website. '[Cameron] was so smart. She had a memory better than most adults.'

A GoFundMe has been set up to help with funeral expenses, CantonRep noted.

A request for more information to the sheriff's office was not immediately answered.
