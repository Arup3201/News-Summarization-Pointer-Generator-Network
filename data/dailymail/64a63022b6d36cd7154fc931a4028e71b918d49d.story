A teenager who became the youngest person in Britain to have a full sex change is hoping to be crowned Miss England.

After four suicide attempts, Jackie Green, 18, from Leeds, underwent surgery to become a woman on her 16th birthday.

Ever since she was a toddler, Jackie - who was
born a boy and named Jack - always acted like a girl 
and insisted on wearing feminine clothes and playing with girls’ toys.

Her parents came to terms with the 
fact she was really a girl trapped inside a boy’s body and spent, in 
total, £28,000 on her treatment.

At her lowest point, the teenager even threatened to cut off her own genitals with a knife.

Now Jackie has her sights set on a model future as she dreams of a place in the Miss England semi-finals.

She said: 'It’s a little strange because there are so many other really gorgeous girls in the competition.

'It would be amazing to win and I just hope it makes other people see that there is a lot more to life than getting bullied.'

She added: 'When I was younger I never really 
had anyone else to look up to in the same position. I would have never 
imagined this, not in a million years.'

Her supportive mother Susie added: 'If she went on to win I would be very proud of her.

'She has stuck herself out there and knew she would get flak for it. Some comments on websites haven’t 
been very kind but she is aware of that and thinks why should that stop 
me, I’m the same as anyone else.'

Jackie is currently leading the public vote in her heat of the popular beauty contest.

The top three will then go through to a
judging panel before a lucky model is given the coveted spot in the 
semi-finals of Miss England.

A spokesman for the competition said: 'There's not much we could do legally to stop her entering.

'We did agonise over it, but as she is a woman she fits the bill and is an affable young lady.'

Jackie underwent a seven-hour sex change operation in Thailand, where under 18s can have the surgery, two years ago.

After years of bullying and torment, she now claims to lead a normal life and has a boyfriend.
