Premera Blue Cross, a health insurer based in the Pacific Northwest, said Tuesday that it was the victim of a cyberattack that could affect 11 million people.

The company said hackers gained access to its systems on May 5 and that it did not discover the breach until Jan. 29.

The breach could have exposed members' names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, mailing and email addresses, phone numbers, member ID numbers and bank account information, the Mountlake Terrace, Washington, company said. 

Hacked: Premera Blue Cross said Tuesday its computer network had been hacked, potentially exposing data from 11 million people, in the second recent such attack on a major US health insurer

The information dates as far back as 2002 and affects users of Premera Blue Cross, Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska, and Vivacity and Connection Insurance Solutions.

Claims information, including clinical information as well as the personal information of people who did business with Premera, could also have been exposed.

Premera said it has not found evidence that data was removed from its systems or that customer information has been used inappropriately. 

Premera said it was working with the FBI and the private security firm Mandiant 'to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the incident and to remove the infection created by the attack.'

'The security of Premera's members' personal information remains a top priority. We at Premera take this issue seriously and sincerely regret the concern it may cause,' said Premera chief executive Jeff Roe.

Breach: The company admitted the breach could have exposed members' names, dates of birth, social security numbers, addresses and more

'As much as possible, we want to make this event our burden, not that of the affected individuals, by making services available today to help protect people's information.'

It will provide two years of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to consumers affected by the breach. 

Premera currently has about 1.8 million members. It provides health, life, vision, dental, disability and other types of insurance. 

In February, Anthem, the second-largest health insurer in the U.S., disclosed a breach that affected about 80 million customers.

Cybersecurity experts say that attack was a sign that hackers are shifting their focus away from retailers and looking at targets in health care and other fields because their systems may be more easily breached.

Companies ranging from retailers Target and Home Depot to Sony Pictures Entertainment have disclosed expensive and embarrassing data breaches recently. 

Last year, US retailer Home Depot said 53 million email addresses were stolen, months after fellow retailer Target said the personal data of 70 million customers was accessed. Analysts are now suggesting hackers could be moving away from retailers to companies like insurers, where sensitive data goes beyond the financial
