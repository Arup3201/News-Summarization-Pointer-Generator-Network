Bradford West MP George Galloway said Israel was an 'illegal, barbarous, savage state'

Controversial  MP George Galloway today vowed not to be 'silenced' after he was interviewed under caution by police for publicly declaring Bradford an ‘Israel-free zone’ in protest at the war in Gaza.

Speaking in Leeds earlier this month, the veteran Left-wing firebrand said Israelis were no longer welcome in the city where he has a constituency. The remarks sparked outrage and hundreds of complaints to  West Yorkshire Police.

Mr Galloway today lashed out at the police's decision to question him over the speech. 

He said: 'This is an absolute and despicable attempt to curb my freedom of speech by people who appear to be quite happy about the indiscriminate murder of Palestinians in Gaza.'

Mr Galloway added: 'I won't be silenced, I will keep speaking out against horrendous injustice.'

The police probe was sparked after Mr Galloway made a speech in Leeds in front of a Palestinian flag, lashing out at Israel's policies in Gaza. 

In one part of his speech, Mr Galloway said: ‘We have declared Bradford an Israel-free zone.

‘We don’t want any Israeli goods. We don’t want any Israeli services. We don’t want any Israeli academics coming to the university or college.

‘We don’t even want any Israeli tourists to come to Bradford even if any of them had thought of doing so.

‘We reject this illegal, barbarous, savage state that calls itself Israel. And you have to do the same.’

The row escalated on Monday after Daniel Taub, Israel's ambassador to the UK, visited Bradford and held meetings with local Jews and prominent councillors.

During his visit Mr Taub said: 'In the best spirit of Yorkshire, the real voice of Bradford knows that there has only ever been one good boycott – and that's Geoff Boycott.'

He also tweeted a picture of himself holding an Israeli passport outside city hall and another with an Israeli flag in the Greengates area of the city. 

The move was described as a 'deliberate provocation' by Zulfi Karim, secretary of the Bradford Council of Mosques.

Mr Karim said on Tuesday: 'For an ambassador to unfurl an Israeli flag by a Welcome To Bradford sign is a deliberate provocation and not the behaviour I would expect of an ambassador of one of the world's most important countries.'

Mr Galloway has now been interviewed and the Crown Prosecution Service will decide whether any charges should follow.

The District Commander for Leeds, Chief Superintendent Paul Money, said: ‘A 59-year-old man has been interviewed under caution voluntarily following complaints made about the content of a speech given in Leeds earlier this month.

‘Once enquiries are completed the matter will be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service for their consideration.’

Mr Galloway won a landslide victory in a byelection in the Bradford West constituency in 2012, which he dubbed the Bradford Spring.
