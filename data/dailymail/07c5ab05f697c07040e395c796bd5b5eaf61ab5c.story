A self-confessed makeup addict who spends thousands of pounds on beauty products every year has vowed to go bare-faced for 12 months to raise money for charity.

Rebecca Mead, 25, says she never leaves the house without wearing foundation, powder, blusher, mascara, lipstick, eyeshadow and eyeliner - which takes her an hour every morning to apply.

In her lifetime, Becca, who lives in Hadley, Suffolk, claims she has spent more than 5,000 hours applying makeup to her face - and is now going cold turkey  – to prove women do not need 'a mask' and to raise money for Special Effects, which helps disabled people.

Becca, who will also stop dyeing her hair every month and wearing fake nails, said: 'Considering I have worn a full face of makeup everyday for 16 years and refused to leave the house without a full layer of foundation it's quite scary.'

So far, the beauty obsessive, who spends hundreds of pounds a year on beauty products, says people's reactions have been mixed.

'Some people have said nothing but other people said I looked tired, which isn't great,' she said.

The supermarket worker started applying hair dye at 12 and wearing makeup at 14, spending hours before school carefully applying cosmetics to her face.

She would spend at least an hour each morning layering on foundation, powder, blusher, mascara, lipstick, eyeshadow and eyeliner and even put on false eyelashes.

'I'd get up at least an hour earlier each morning so I looked my best,' Miss Mead admitted. 'I had special tricks like applying extra powder to my eyebrows to make them look thicker.

'I would carefully apply nail varnish and had boxes of cosmetics which I ordered off the internet.

'I spent a lot of money on makeup and loved it.' 

But Becca is now out to prove a point: 'I think women have become too reliant on makeup and I want to prove they don't need to be.

Becca admitted hair dye was one of her biggest problems, and she changes her colour every month

'There was a time when I would change my hair colour every month – now I realise that was not necessary.

'I can't believe I used to be too scared to leave the house without makeup. I wouldn't even pop to the shops without applying slap which seems ridiculous.'

'I don't know what my natural hair colour is,' she admitted. 'Possibly brown.

When it came to make up, Becca admits she used to would wear 'the whole shebang'. 

'I even put power on my eyebrows to thicken them,' she said. 'This was to give them more shape.

Becca also admitted hair dye was one of her biggest problems. 'I probably changed my hair colour every month,' she said.

'I became addicted - most colour I used was quite unnatural.'

Becca who decided to quit her addiction earlier this month said she received great encouragement from friends. 'I asked a few of my friends what they thought and decided to go for it. 

'I can't believe I've thrown the makeup out.'
