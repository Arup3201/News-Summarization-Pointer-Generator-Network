A North Carolina man sporting a  '666' tattoo on his forehead has been charged with first-degree murder for fatally stabbing another man in a church, police say.

William Everett Long, 53, stabbed George provost, 61, Thursday after the two got into an argument while making sandwiches at Duck United Methodist Church as part of a charity program in the small town of Duck, WTKR reports. 

The murder is the first in the tiny, seven-mile, seaside community in Dare County with a population of 379. The town was founded in 1668 as part of Currituck County.

'This tragedy doesn't just hit the church, it's hit our community very hard,' Sergeant Jeff Ackerman told WTKR.

Ackerman said that the two argued and Long pulled a knife out of a kitchen drawer and attacked Provost.

The victim was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead at around 8.40am, according to CBS.

Long, who has a lengthy rap sheet, is being held without bond. 

Ackerman said that police are also looking in to the man's unusual '666' tattoo which, in a biblical context, is associated with the Antichrist.

No other guests or volunteers were injured in the incident, The Outer Banks Voice reports.

Pray: The homeless-based charity program, OBX Room in the Inn, posted on its Facebook page asking people to pray for the homeless in the area

The two were staying at the church as part of the OBX Room in the Inn program, a church-based homeless assistance program providing food and shelter to the area's homeless population.

The church released a statement saying 'In the midst of this tragedy, we remain prayerful.'

The program, which is in its seventh year of operation, too released a statement about the incident on its Facebook page, requesting privacy as an investigation into the incident is conducted.
