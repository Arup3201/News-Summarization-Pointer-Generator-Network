A Palestinian refugee achieved his lifetime ambition to one day own a lion when he adopted two of them and brought them into his home.

Saad al-Jamal purchased the two-month-old lion cubs from the cash-strapped Rafah zoo.

He has plans to raise them at his house in the Al-Shabora refugee camp in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, although he faces a difficult task as the lions - and their appetites - grow.

He refused to say how much he paid for the cubs, but admitted to AFP that he has received a $9,000 offer (£6,000) to buy them. 

The two lion cubs, one male and one female, have been named Alex and Mona.

They have been living in the three-bedroom flat ‘like members of the family’ for 10 weeks, and they play 'all day long' with Mr al-Jamal's children and grandchildren.

Footage shows the cubs play-fighting on the floor of the family's flat, and interacting with young children.

Bringing the cubs outside, Mr al-Jamal holds the lions in his arms and as of them fights against him to be put back down.

Other clips show the owner is featured stroking them as they bask in the sun.

It is believed that the parents of the cubs were brought into Gaza via a tunnel along the border with Egypt around three years ago.

Raising two lion cubs is a costly venture, and Mr al-Jamal has plans to use them to earn money. He intends to lease them to parks, restaurants and seaside resorts once they are a few months older.

Once the cubs are 15-months-old they will develop adult teeth and possess the ability to tear flesh

At just two months, the cubs eat half a kilogram of meat a day, and their appetites will become even larger as they get older. 

Right now the animals are at an age where they are unable to inflict any real damage.

But once the cubs reach 15-months-old they will develop adult teeth and will possess the ability to tear flesh.

At which point, Mr al-Jamal’s living situation might not be so harmonious.
