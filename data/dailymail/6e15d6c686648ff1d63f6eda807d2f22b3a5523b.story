Emily Hartridge’s quirky ’10 reasons why’ videos cover a variety of issues affecting young people in modern life, and have propelled her to internet stardom.

Her YouTube channel now has over 35,000 subscribers enjoying her frank and funny approach, complete with sketches, on topics as diverse as siblings and Christmas, to sexual experiences.

Her latest video gives 10 reasons why her male fans should date an older woman, or ‘cougar’.

Emily Hartridge tells her You Tube viewers exactly why they should date a cougar in this weeks installment of her video blog

Reason one: A technically naive cougar won't be able to check up on you

Reason three: A cougar will chase you

Confessing that she herself was once a cougar (by two years) and using her friend George as her pretend boyfriend to help her illustrate each reason, Emily, referencing the silly America Pie movie, explains: ‘Dating a cougar is every guys dream. I mean even I would have had sex with Stifler’s mum.’

Reasons for this idolisation are, according to Emily, a great deal to do with the confidence older women often possess in comparison to their younger counterparts.

This self-assurance means not only will there be less tantrums and insecurities in the relationship, but that a cougar is more likely to be assertive - which is sexy - and to be more independent.

Not only is a cougar unlikely to lean on her man for emotional and financial support, she might actually take care of him.

1. Older women probably aren’t going to be tech savvy, so they cant check up on you

2. They are more experienced in the bedroom

3. Older women are independent – they won't depend on you for financial and emotional support

4. There will be less tantrums and insecurities in your relationship

5. You won’t need to chase them, they’ll chase you

6. A cougar will never drag  you to see a Twilight movie

7. They are wise, and so a cougar will take care of you

8. Older women have enough life experience to know what they want

9. Cougars are past stage of having children

10. Your friends will be jealous

They are also less likely to ‘check up’ on you using your phone or Facebook, as a cougar probably wont be that tech savvy.

Another reason behind the cougar's allure for a man is that they will pursue you.

As Emily explains: ‘A cougar is actually a big cat that likes to hunt, rather than be hunted. So if you detain a cougar, you won’t need to do the chasing, she’ll get her man.’

And of course, another reason men should date a cougar is their additional sexual know-how and skills.

As Emily points out: ‘What’s better than a hands on lesson?’

‘Let’s say you’re the cougar and you’re dating a younger guy who doesn’t really know what he’s doing in the bedroom, think how much you’ll be helping him with future women he'll have sex with,’ she says.

However, while a cougar having grown 
up in a different era may have benefits, it also of course means that 
they are older – and Emily uses an online ageing app on herself to show 
that this is not always such a good thing.
