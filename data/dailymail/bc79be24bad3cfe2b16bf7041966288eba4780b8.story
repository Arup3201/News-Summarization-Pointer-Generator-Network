Fibre fan: Gabby credits potatoes for her slim waist

Sports presenter Gabby Logan has a refreshing diet tip for anyone who likes food: eat more potatoes – and bread. 

In an age when even the Chancellor George Osborne is said to starve himself for two days a week to keep slim, her stance seems rather radical. 

Yet the TV star claims her approach is the key to a trim waist, and swears she has never cut out food groups or gone hungry.

‘You hear about pop stars like Katy Perry or Miley Cyrus cutting out bread because of a gluten intolerance but they have a team of dedicated cooks,’ says the mother of two. 

‘My worry is that celebrity stories lead to more people deciding to exclude key food groups from their diets without proper medical supervision, when that’s not the healthiest option.

‘I take real pride in giving my twins Reuben and Lois and my husband Kenny well-balanced, home-cooked meals where I know exactly what we’re eating, rather than choosing whatever option is more fashionable.’

And it seems she has a point. Last month, new research suggested that a third of Britons avoid wheat because fad diets warn against gluten, the protein contained in the grain – despite only two per cent of the population actually having an allergy.

While experts believe some people might suffer mild intolerances that lead to bloating and stomach aches, this clearly isn’t a motivating factor in many cases.

 The survey also found that the majority of those who go wheat-free don’t actually know what gluten is.

The main concern among health chiefs is that this approach is contributing to our already poor fibre intake. Medical guidelines recommend we consume at least 18g of this indigestible type of carbohydrate found in plants (abundantly in fruit, veg, beans, pulses and grains) a day.

Without it our digestive system does not function properly. 

Studies show those people who eat lots of it are slimmer and have a lower risk of heart disease, cancers and diabetes. 

Yet the average Briton is said to consume just 14g a day.

Having already lent her name to the British Heart Foundation-backed Flora ProActiv drive to promote heart health in women, Gabby is now working with Weetabix to try to get us to eat more fibre.

She has altered her already admirable diet to include about 30g a day – the amount studies say protects against illness.

That sounds a lot when you consider a slice of brown bread contains just 2g, but she didn’t feel she had to make massive changes.

 ‘Often it was a matter of eating jacket potatoes with the skin on, and making sure I had high-fibre snacks in between meals,’ says Gabby.

‘Oatcakes, which contain about 1.8g of fibre per biscuit, were a lifesaver, and endlessly versatile in terms of adding toppings. Houmous has 3g of fibre per 25g. A portion of beans – not just the baked variety, although they are great – will give you about 6g.

‘If you make sure you eat five portions of veg a day, and a couple of fruit, you’ll easily be getting 20g of fibre from those alone.’

Spuds-a-lots: Since increasing her daily fibre intake, sports presenter Gabby has felt the benefits

Although Gabby, 41, is fastidious about her health today, the former gymnast and daughter of Welsh international footballer and manager Terry Yorath has suffered her fair share of illness.

Her sporting career ended due to sciatica, and she suffered a near-fatal haemorrhage in 2005 when she gave birth to her twins, now aged nine.

And, of course, tragedy struck her family when her younger brother Daniel died of a sudden cardiac arrest in 1992, aged just 15, followed by her distraught father’s battle with the bottle. For these reasons, Gabby is never complacent about her own family’s health.

Eating more fibre doesn’t have to mean munching through boxes of cardboard-like bran at breakfast. Here are a few foods that contain surprisingly high amounts:

● Popcorn: 6.5g (150g portion)

● Dried figs: 2.9g (30g portion)

● Avocado: 5g (75g portion)

● Peas: 4.4g (80g portion)

● Blackberries: 4.2g (80g portion)

● Pear: 4g (150g, compared with 1.2g per 100g for apple)

● Sweetcorn, freshly cooked cob: 6.3g (125g portion)

● Onion: 3.3g (150g portion)

● Jacket potato with the skin on: 4.7g (180g portion)

● Oatcakes: 1.8g (per cake)

● Peanut butter: 1g (per tbsp)

‘However good you think your diet is, it’s dangerous to feel you’re fine – I know how easy it is to slip into bad eating habits, especially when you’re incredibly busy,’ she says. Since increasing her fibre intake, Gabby has felt the benefits.

 ‘I’d been feeling bloated, especially after breakfast, and then suffered energy slumps later in the day, both of which have gone now,’ she says.

 ‘My diet wasn’t problematic, but I knew it wasn’t perfect – it goes to show how you are what you eat. I’ve noticed my skin improve, too.’

Gabby has one concession to food fads. Every morning she blends her own ‘green drink’ from a variety of ingredients, including hemp, ginger, kale, sunflower seeds and bee pollen.

‘I might have that with some fruit, or add in half a wholemeal bagel with some peanut butter on, both of which are high in fibre. 

'Then I might have a wholemeal fruit scone for a mid-morning snack, a handful or two of unsalted almonds mid-afternoon, or an oatcake with some goat’s cheese, and more fruit and water,’ she adds.

Dietician Sian Porter advises anyone who wants to increase their fibre intake to do so gradually. She says: ‘Perhaps add 5g of fibre a day for a week, and then go up by another 5g each week until you hit the daily 30g target. 

'You should also increase your water intake and the amount of exercise you’re doing, even if that’s just a short walk after meals.

‘It’s significant dietary change, so if you feel uncomfortable, slightly reduce your fibre intake for a few days before starting again, or see your GP if the problems persist, as a reaction to a high-fibre diet can be a sign of irritable bowel syndrome.’
