Prince Harry confessed tonight he missed his role as an Apache helicopter pilot and would like to return to flying in the future.

The fourth in line to the throne, who quit the Army Air Corps in January for a desk job organising military events including the Invictus Games for wounded warriors, reminisced about his time in Aghanistan with veterans of the conflict at a Buckingham Palace reception.

'He said he enjoyed the flying and he missed it,' said Flight Sergeant Lee Renard, a veteran of three tours of duty in Iraq and 11 in Afghanistan between 2006 and 2014.

Another Afghanistan veteran, Flight Lieutenant Lance Levin, a Chinook helicopter pilot from 27 Squadron, RAF Odiham, said: 'He said he enjoys his flying and would like to return at some point.'

There has been speculation that Harry, 30, a Captain in the Household Cavalry, might return to flying Apaches after he finishes his current posting.

However, royal sources have so far suggested that is unlikely, although they have not ruled out the Prince doing some other role involving flying. 

The Prince loved his five-month posting to Afghanistan in winter 2012-13 where he served as a top gun co-pilot, often providing top cover for medical evacuations. But he did not enjoy the social side of life on base at Wattisham, Suffolk.

As an Apache pilot, it was his regular job to provide cover from above as the teams retrieved casualties from the battlefield, often under enemy fire.

Paramedic Sgt Kevin McClean, 35, from Carrickfergus, Co Antrim, said: 'They were our support helicopter. My job was to get to the casualty, with four gunners from air force protection and do the triage and get them onto the helicopter. It was good to have the Apache pilots providing top cover, particularly if we were under fire.'

At Buckingham Palace on Thursday night, Prince Harry and his brother Prince William were joined by the Queen, the Duke of York and Princess Alexandra at a reception for 400 guests to thank those who have supported wounded, injured and sick service personnel.

It was William and Harry's idea to celebrate the role played by medical, military and civilian specialists who have helped the wounded warriors on their path to recovery. 

Among the guests at the palace were those who were saved by the bravery and quick actions of their comrades and the medics.

Taking to the air: Prince Harry said that he would like to return to flying 'at some point' in his career

Former Royal Marine Mark Ormrod, 31, from Plymouth, became the first British triple amputee of the Afghan conflict, losing both legs and an arm, when he stepped on an improvised explosive device in 2007. 

Now a motivational speaker and successful businessman, he said he had never thought about just how many people had been involved in helping him in his recovery until he arrived at the reception, in the palace state apartments. Paying tribute to them all, he said: 'I've never actually thought about it until I came here tonight.' 

Aides said Prince Harry, who took the desk job specifically to organise the first Invictus Games, a highly acclaimed international event for wounded military veterans that took place in London in September, remained focused for the moment on his current job organising events.

He would normally be expected to spend at least two years in his current post and it is understood that no decision has yet been taken on what the Prince, who is expected to be promoted to Major at some point in the near future, will do next.
