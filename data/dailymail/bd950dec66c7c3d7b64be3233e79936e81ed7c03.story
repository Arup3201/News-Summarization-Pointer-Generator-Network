Voters who back UKIP at the next election risk 'going to bed with Nigel Farage and waking up with Ed Miliband', David Cameron has warned.

The Prime Minister said the next election would be a 'straight fight' between Labour and the Tories, and a vote for UKIP made it more likely that Ed Miliband becomes Prime Minister in 2015.

The jibe came just hours before former Tory donor Arron Banks announced he was handing £1million to UKIP, in protest at being dismissed as a 'nobody' by senior Conservative William Hague.

The PM warned voters toying with the idea of voting UKIP that they were really voting for Labour. 

But hours after Mr Cameron's attack in his conference speech, millionaire Tory party donor Mr Banks announced he was donating £1million to UKIP.

The move came after the Tories were left stunned by the double defection of rebel backbenchers Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless.

The pair were also joined by Boris Johnson's former deputy London mayor Richard Barnes.

But Mr Cameron insisted that a vote for UKIP would only make a Labour government more likely.  

He told the Conservative conference: ''Let's be clear. This is a straight fight. It doesn't matter whether Parliament is hung, drawn or quartered, there is only one real choice.

'The Conservatives or Labour. Me in Downing Street, or Ed Miliband in Downing Street.

'If you vote UKIP – that's really a vote for Labour.'

He went on: 'Here's a thought: on 7th May you could go to bed with Nigel Farage, and wake up with Ed Miliband. I don't know about you but not one bit of that works for me.

'So this is the big question for that election. On the things that matter in your life, who do you really trust?

'When it comes to your job, do you trust Labour – who wrecked our economy – or the Conservatives, who have made this one of the fastest-growing economies in the West?

'When it comes to Britain's future, who do you trust? Labour – the party of something-for-nothing, and human wrongs under the banner of human rights, or the Conservatives – who believe in something for something, and reward for hard work?' 

UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the Tories were paying for insulting UKIP supporters like multi-millionaire Arron Banks (right) who upped his donation to UKIP to £1million

Mr Cameron's remarks came Mr Banks, who has previously given tens of thousands of pounds to the Conservatives, announced today that he was switching his allegiance to UKIP.

He initially said he was going to give the party £100,000. But last night he announced he was handing the party £1million to fight the next election - because he was angry at being called a 'nobody' by William Hague. 

Mr Hague - the Commons leader - dismissed the importance of Mr Banks' defection yesterday morning.

He said: 'I've never heard of him so we are not going to get too upset about that. It's certainly not going to overshadow the prime minister's speech today that someone we haven't heard of has gone to Ukip.'

The remarks infuriated Mr Banks, causing him to increase his planned donation to UKIP.

The joke was captured in this photograph of the autocue, after Mr Cameron rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory

Speaking to reporters last night he said: 'In light of that and in view of the fact that I am a strong advocate of leaving the EU, I've decided to donate £1million to the party and not the £100,000 originally agreed.' He added: 'Mr Hague will now know who I am.'

Mr Farage said the donation had capped a 'remarkable week' for UKIP following Mr Reckless's defection on Saturday.

He also lashed out at the personal attacks directed against UKIP during the Tory party conference in Birmingham.

The UKIP threat has sparked an angry torrent of abuse against Mr Farage's party at the Tory conference in Birmingham this week.

Boris Johnson accused defectors of being the kind of people who had sex with vacuum cleaners - while former Chancellor Ken Clarke said the party's supporters were 'grumpy old men' who had led 'disappointing lives'.

Mr Cameron, meanwhile, attacked Mr Reckless for betraying the hard work of ordinary Conservative activists which had got his 'fat arse' into the Commons.
