A retired nurse who is a self-confessed trouble-maker has been crowned 2014 Ms Nursing Home Alabama.

Edna Farrell, 89, a resident of the Arbor Springs Health and Rehab Centre beat 58 other contestants from across the state to take the top honour earlier this week.

The 58 contestants, who ranged in age from 52 to 95, had won pageants at their nursing homes before competing at state level.

The winners were then narrowed down to the top ten who competed for the title at a pageant in Birmingham in front of a 300-strong crowd.

The women were judged on their attitude toward life, alertness, personality, ability to show happiness with life in a nursing home, and what they'd done for others.

Ms Farrell said her victory came 'as quite a shock', Al.com Alabama reported.

She said: 'I've only been in a nursing home for just about a year, and I have gotten myself into trouble many times.'

As a retired nurse, Ms Farrell often can't help herself from interfering.

She said: 'I know how things should go, and when they don't go that way, I always ask why.

'I just have to remember that I no longer have a license to nurse and to keep my big mouth shut.'

Mark Traylor, the administrator at Arbor Springs Health & Rehab, said: 'We never know where Ms Farrell's quick wit and sharp mind will take us next.'

He said: 'She's very active and tries to inspire other residents to get involved.'

One of Ms Farrell's goals as Ms Nursing Home Alabama is to help people understand that 'you're not nuts because you live in a nursing home'.

she said. 'Everybody has problems now and again, but there are things that with medication and proper teaching, you can overcome a good many obstacles.'

Ms Farrell said she hadn't expected to win,'but in every girl's heart, there's always a thing â€“ she'd like to be No. 1'.

Ms Farrell, grew up in New York, but she and her late husband, John, moved around the country a lot after they graduated from Cornell University's nursing school and he took a job as a registered nurse with the U.S. Army.

As well as being a military wife and mother to three children, Ms Farrell worked as a nurse for the Army Cadet Corp.

She moved into Arbour Springs about a year ago after she injured her shoulder in a fall and required more medical attention.

Before then she had lived with one of her son's, after her husband passed away after 40 years of marriage.

Ms Farrell said she enjoys living in the nursing home, where she is a member of the Hallelujah Chorus singing group and president of the nursing home's Red Hat Society.
