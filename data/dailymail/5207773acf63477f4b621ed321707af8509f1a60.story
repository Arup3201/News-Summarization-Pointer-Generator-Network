Controversy: Tory, Lib Dem and Labour members furiously debated a 7.7 per cent rise in the price of tea at the House of Commons from 65p to 70p

With large parts of Britain under water, the NHS in chaos and the economy barely out of recession, you might think MPs had better things to do than worry about a 5p rise in the cost of a cuppa in the Commons Tea Room.

But politicians staged a heated debate on the issue at Westminster last week, and voted by narrow majority to increase the price from 65p to 70p.

The taxpayer-subsidised cost is still less than half the price of a cup in Caffè Nero opposite Big Ben, where tea is at least £1.65.

The debate took place behind closed doors at a meeting of the Commons Administration Committee, which is in charge of catering at Westminster.

Tribal party allegiances were put to one side as Tory David Evenett, Labour’s Mark Tami and Lib Dem Mark Hunter vigorously opposed the 7.7 per cent hike.

One source said: ‘They said the price of a cup of tea is high enough and there is no reason why MPs – or staff – should pay any more.’

But Labour’s Thomas Docherty said MPs could not impose budget cuts on ordinary voters and then refuse to do likewise in the Commons.

The 5p increase would save taxpayers £10,000 a year, officials said.

The rise, to come in from April across most Commons cafes, was decided by a majority of five to four.

The committee chairman, Tory MP Sir Alan Haselhurst, did not vote while Dave Watts, chairman of the backbench Parliamentary Labour Party, decided to abstain.

Commons bosses have already introduced price rises across the network of Westminster cafes and restaurants to bring them closer to high street prices.

Savings: The boosted price of the popular beverage will save about £25,000 of taxpayers' money a year

Change: Despite a bid to move closer to high street costs, it remains less than half the price of Caffe Nero tea

Debate: MPs were told they could not impose budget cuts to ordinary voters and then refuse to do likewise

A series of other increases were approved, including 5p for a banana, taking it to 35p, 5p on a bag of chips (85p) and 5p on a cup of latte coffee (£1.70).

All the measures together will save about £25,000 a year.

One MP who did not take part in the debate said: ‘MPs don’t earn as much as people think and  I don’t think 65p is particularly cheap.

'Our secretaries earn even less. The way things are going, we will soon have to pay the kind of prices you get in five-star hotel.’

But Mr Docherty defended the increase, saying: ‘We have to make an effort to reduce the taxpayer subsidy on catering.’
