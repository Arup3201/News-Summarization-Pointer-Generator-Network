The man who confessed to one of the most infamous crimes in New York City's history may go free because authorities say there simply isn't enough evidence to win a prosecution.

Last year, Pedro Hernandez, 52, confessed to murdering 6-year-old Etan Patz on May 25, 1979 after luring him into the basement of a SoHo bodega. Once Patz was in the basement, Hernandez says he strangled the boy to death, put his body in a bag and then left him on the street in a pile of trash.

The problem for prosecutors is that even though Hernandez has confessed, there's no physical evidence or eyewitnesses linking him to the crime - and Patz's body has never been recovered (it's suspected it was hauled to a landfill).

Did he do it? Other than a confession, there is no evidence that Pedro Hernandez had anything to do with Patz's death

Tragic: Etan Patz disappeared in May of 1979 - when he was just 6 years old - while he was walking to school alone for the first time

Another challenge for prosecutors is Hernandez's mental state - according to his attorney, the alleged killer suffers from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

'There’s a consensus among prosecutors there that this case cannot be 
won,' a former prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office 
told The New York Post.

Several members of the NYPD's Missing Person Squad continue to investigate the case looking for any piece of evidence to help prove that Hernandez is the killer - or that he's not.

'They’ve interviewed these people over and over and over again. Some of 
them five to 10 times. This has been going on for over a year. It’s 
exhausting,' a police source said.

Reopened: In 2010, the Patz case was reopened, which led authorities to tear up a cement floor in SoHo looking for a body. They found nothing

Patz's disappearance received a lot of coverage in the media and continues to garner headlines. Patz was the first missing child featured on a milk carton.

Over the years, other suspects have emerged in the Patz case, most notably convicted child rapist Jose Ramos, who was a friend of a woman who'd babysat the boy.

Ramos was convicted of multiple counts of child molestation and served a 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania. While incarcerated, a jailhouse snitch told authorities that Ramos had confessed to him that he knew what happened to Patz. However, it wasn't enough evidence for prosecutors to pursue charges.

Despite no criminal charges, the Patz family sued Ramos in civil court, where he was found to have been responsible for the boy's death. The Patz's were awarded a ceremonial $2million, which they never attempted to collect.

Hernandez was arrested after Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance reopened the case in 2010 and police started getting new leads, including calls from Hernandez's family members who said he'd told them - and his priest - that he killed Patz.

During his videotaped confession to police, Hernandez asked the officers to kneel and pray 
alongside him, which they did. His attorney, Harvey Fishbein, says the officers' praying with Hernandez was 'manipulative.'

Fishbein is arguing that Hernandez's mental illness contributed to his making what he believes to be a false confession.

'We are not admitting in any sense that he committed this crime. This is 
not a defense of not guilty by reason of insanity — '‘I did it but I was 
crazy,'” Fishbein told The Post. 'He didn’t do it. He confessed to it, 
and it’s the reliability of that confession that’s the issue here.'

Regardless of whether Hernandez's confession is true, both prosecutors and the defense acknowledge that convicting him without any additional evidence will be challenging, if not impossible.
