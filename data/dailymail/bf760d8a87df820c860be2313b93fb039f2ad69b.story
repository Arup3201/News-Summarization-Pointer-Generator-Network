A jury has recommended the death penalty for a self-styled street preacher convicted of killing three down-and-out men lured by bogus Craigslist job offers despite his mother's tearful plea for leniency.

The same Ohio jury that first convicted Richard Beasley made its recommendation after hearing from his mother and other witnesses who testified of the 53-year-old having had a rough childhood that included physical and sexual abuse.

Victims' relatives hugged as the jury's recommendation was announced with his sentencing set for Tuesday. Beasley hung his head without moving on Wednesday, and his mother sobbed.

Beasley was convicted of teaming up with a teenager in 2011 to lure men with offers of farmhand jobs in southeast Ohio and to rob them. Three men were killed, and a fourth who was wounded testified at Beasley's trial.

Jack Kern, whose 47-year-old son, Timothy Kern, was killed, alternately cried and smiled over the jury's recommendation.

'They made the right decision,' he said outside court. 'They knew what they had in their heart and what they had to do. They did it for us.'

The jurors left without commenting.

Beasley's co-defendant, who was 16 at the time of the crimes, was too young to face the death penalty. Brogan Rafferty was sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole on his conviction last year.

Vindication: The son of Jack Kern, second from left, was one of the victims Beasley killed after he applied to one of his fake Craigslist ads

In closing arguments, both sides 
highlighted Rafferty's life sentence in contrast to a possible death 
sentence for Beasley. The defense said that issue should factor into the
jury's deliberations, but the prosecution said it wasn't an issue 
because Rafferty's age, by law, had ruled out death as an option.

The
jury received Beasley's case after hearing two hours of testimony from 
witnesses, including Beasley's tearful mother, who were called to 
portray him sympathetically and press for leniency.

Carol
Beasley testified that her son had a troubled childhood and had 
suffered physical abuse by his stepfather. She also said she learned 
within the past year that her son had been sexually abused by 
neighborhood youngsters.

Victims: In addition to Ralph Geiger, David Pauley (left) was found buried in a shallow grave in 2011. Police later unearthed the body of Timothy Kern (right)

Partner in crime: Beasley's co-defendant Brogan Rafferty, seen, who was 16 at the time of the crimes, was too young to face the death penalty for his part in the murders

'I always felt there was much more than he told me,' she said.

As she testified, Beasley slumped 
forward, his chin on his chest and his right hand covering his eyes. He 
uses a wheelchair because of back pain.

The
defense also called a psychologist, John Fabian, who testified that 
Beasley suffers from depression, alcohol abuse, low self-esteem and a 
feeling of isolation, all possible results of a troubled, abusive 
childhood.

Prosecutor 
Jonathan Baumoel had urged jurors to consider the 'enormous' weight of 
Beasley's crimes as they considered his punishment.

Mother's plea: Beasley's mother, Carol Beasley, seen during an earlier court hearing, made her final plea for her son on Wednesday while explaining him having been sexually and physically abused growing up

Plot: Beasley, seen during an earlier court appearance, was convicted of luring several men with offers of farmhand jobs in southeast Ohio and to rob them

One of Beasley's victims was killed near Akron, and the others were shot at a southeast Ohio farm during bogus job interviews.

The slain men were Ralph Geiger, 56, of Akron; David Pauley, 51, of Norfolk, Va.; and Kern, of Massillon. All were down-and-out men looking for a fresh start in life, the prosecution said repeatedly during the trial.

The survivor, Scott Davis, now 49, testified that he heard the click of a gun as he walked in front of Beasley at the reputed job site. Davis, who was shot in an arm, knocked the weapon aside, fled into the woods and tipped police.

Beasley, who returned to Ohio from Texas in 2004 after serving several years in prison on a burglary conviction, testified that he met with Davis and Davis had pulled a gun in retaliation for Beasley serving as a police informant in a motorcycle gang investigation.
