The controversy over ammonia-treated beef - or what critics dub ‘pink slime’ - broadened this week as it was revealed that the caustic cleaning chemical is also used in cheese.

Related compounds are also used in baked goods and chocolate.

Ammonia, known for its noxious odor, 
became a hot topic with the uproar over what the meat 
industry calls ‘finely textured beef’ and what a former U.S. government 
scientist first called ‘pink slime’.   

Backlash: Meat industry experts have struck back after the 'pink slime' controversy by pointing out that the chemical is also used in cheese

The caustic cleaning chemical is also used widely in cheese and similar chemicals are used in baking products

Ammonia is a nitrogen compound with a distinctive pungent smell of urine. It's used widely as a cleaning agent - although it's highly caustic in its pure form.

'Pink slime' beef is made from fatty trimmings sprayed with ammonium hydroxide - ammonia mixed with water - to remove pathogens such as salmonella and E.coli.    

Ammonia compounds are used as leavening agents in baked goods and as an acidity controller in cheese and sometimes chocolate.     Kraft Foods, whose brands include Chips Ahoy cookies and Velveeta cheese, is one company that uses very small amounts of ammonium compounds in some of its products. It declined to specify which products.    

‘Sometimes ingredient names sound more complicated than they are,’ said Kraft spokeswoman Angela Wiggins.Wiggins said that in turning milk to cheese, a tiny amount of ammonium hydroxide is added to a starter dairy culture to reduce the culture's acidity and encourage cheese cultures to grow.    

The meat industry has been trying to 
raise awareness of other foods that contain ammonia, in response to what
 it has characterized as an unfair attack on a safe and healthy 
product.   

For example, ammonia compounds are 
used as leavening agents in baked goods and as an acidity controller in 
cheese and sometimes chocolate.    

‘Ammonia's not an unusual product to 
find added to food,’ Gary Acuff, director of Texas A&M University's 
Center for Food Safety, told a recent press conference hosted by Beef 
Products Inc. ‘We use ammonia in all kinds of foods in the food 
industry.’   

After critics highlighted the product 
on social media websites and showed unappetizing photos on television, 
calling it ‘pink slime,’ the nation's leading fast-food chains and 
supermarkets spurned the product, even though U.S. public health 
officials deem it safe to eat.

Hundreds of U.S. school districts also 
demanded it be removed from school lunch programs.

One producer, Beef Products Inc, has since idled three factories. Another, AFA Foods, filed for bankruptcy protection.

Ammonia - often associated with 
cleaning products - was cleared by U.S. health officials nearly 40 years
 ago and is used in making many foods, including cheese. Related 
compounds have a role in baked goods and chocolate products.   

Using small amounts of ammonia to make
 food is not unusual to those expert in high-tech food production. Now 
that little known world is coming under increasing pressure from 
concerned consumers who want to know more about what they are eating.   

‘I think we're seeing a 
sea change today in consumers' concerns about the presence of 
ingredients in foods, and this is just one example,’ said Michael Doyle,
 director of the University of Georgia's Center for Food Safety.    

'Slime': The meat industry has retaliated to complaints over its use of ammonia by pointing out that other foods including cheese also use the chemical

Support: Texas Gov. Rick Perry showed his support for Beef Products Inc by tucking into a 'pink slime' burger during a tour of one of their plants

The outrage, which many experts say has been fueled by the term ‘pink slime,’ seems more about the unsavoriness of the product rather than its safety.   

‘This is not a health issue,’ said Bill Marler, a prominent food safety lawyer. ‘This is an 'I'm grossed out by this' issue.’    

Still, critics of so-called ‘Big Food’ point out that while ‘pink slime’ and the ammonia in it may not be harmful, consumer shock over their presence points to a wider issue.   

‘The food supply is full of all sorts of chemical additives that people don't know about,’ said Michele Simon, a public health lawyer and president of industry watchdog consulting firm Eat Drink Politics.   

Wiggins said that in turning milk to cheese, a tiny amount of ammonium hydroxide is added to a starter dairy culture to reduce the culture's acidity and encourage cheese cultures to grow.  

‘It is somewhat similar to activating yeast for dough by adding warm water, sugar and salt to create the proper environment for yeast growth,’ Wiggins said.    

In the case of ammonium phosphate, used as a leavening agent in baking, she said the heat during baking causes the gas to evaporate.
