Peering over the wall at the bottom of his garden, John Marsden received an education in the art of being a striker that money cannot buy.

When Southport head to Derby County, aiming to strike another blow for non-League sides in the FA Cup, Marsden will think back to the days when he studied Robbie Fowler and Michael Owen, and later Fernando Torres and Luis Suarez.

Marsden’s family home in West Derby backs on to Liverpool’s training ground but of the current forwards he monitors, it is Rickie Lambert who is a continued source of inspiration for a young man who holds a record for scoring hat-tricks for Liverpool schoolboys that even Fowler cannot match.

This has been a season illuminated by strikers such as Charlie Austin and Jamie Vardy, who have battled their way from the lower leagues to thrive in the top flight. Lambert’s route was similarly unconventional.

Marsden is a ‘mad Liverpudlian’ and his dream in this season’s FA Cup is to get through today’s challenge before locking horns at Anfield against his boyhood heroes.

‘We have got a shed at the back of the house, so I used to climb on top of it and watch them train,’ says the 22-year-old. ‘Me and my sister, Charlotte, would get autographs most days and speak to the players. Robbie was my hero and I’ve still got his shirt on my wall.’

Had Marsden’s career gone as he envisaged, he would be playing for Celtic. He was scouted by the late Tommy Burns as a schoolboy and his logic was that going to Scotland would increase his chances of playing in the Champions League.

But a broken foot, sustained in a freak schoolyard accident, damaged his ambitions and after leaving Celtic, he had spells with Rochdale, non-League side Stockport Sports, Stoke’s Under 21s and Shrewsbury before ending up with Southport.

‘I was in school and slipped on the wet floor and cracked my bone right through, just coming down a couple of steps,’ he says. ‘I played for Celtic’s reserves, trained with the first team but never got to the level I wanted. It was devastating but that happens in football, doesn’t it?’

Fairytales, however, also happen and Marsden added: ‘I think people like seeing non-League clubs have a bit of a run.

‘We all watched Warrington beat Exeter and we were buzzing. Then you see Blyth and that’s a great story. We’d love one of our own.’
