From flapper dresses and fringes to feathers and finger curls, the 1920s was an era of opulence and post-war fashion fun.

And it seems that the flamboyant style of the Jazz Age has returned, with a little help of Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby film.

According to the latest study, high street stores have seen sales of vintage-inspired items soaring with one such store noting increases of up to 266 per cent.

High street giant Debenhams have seen a huge increase in sales of beaded capes, lace dresses, pearls and twenties style eveningwear.

Sales of feather accessories such as capes and head pieces have increased by over 250 per cent, and eye-catching costume jewellery such as bold diamante encrusted bracelets and extravagant strings of large golden pearls are up 200 per cent compared to this time last year.

Michelle Dowdall, Debenhams spokesman said: 'Twenties style regalia is back! Our customers are snapping up accessories and womenswear to get the Gatsby look - feminine, flapper style is fast becoming one of spring's hottest trends.

'The beauty of this trend is that women can go big or small. A simple feather and pearl hair clip gives a subtle nod to Gatsby, or for full-on twenties glamour, women can wear gorgeous sequined dresses with scalloped hems and lace by eveningwear designer Jenny Packham, accessorised with strings of pearls.'

Bling bling: Sales of feather accessories such as capes and head pieces as seen on Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan have increased by over 250 per cent

Hair jewels and beaded capes favoured by Gatsby's love interest Daisy Buchanan have been popular with customers, with sales increasing by 73 per cent and 250 per cent respectively in the past week alone.

Menswear is also seeing a Gatsby influence on sales, with tuxedo jackets and formal wear up 60 per cent versus this time last year.

Michelle Dowdall added: 'With the opulent party dresses in the film adaptation of Scott Fitzgerald's novel provided by the likes of Prada, and tuxedos from Brooks Bros, it was inevitable that men and women would want to emulate the beautiful twenties fashions seen on set.'

And it isn't just Debenhams reaping the rewards of the 1920's fashion comeback.

Suave: And it isn't just the ladies that have been inspired, men are sharpening up their looks too with dashing George tuxedos and white shirts taking the lead

George at Asda’s Twenties style Charleston beaded dress has flown off the shelves faster than Leonardo DiCaprio can pour a martini cocktail, as the nation’s ladies take inspiration from the roaring Twenties style in the latest Great Gatsby flick.

Women across the UK have embraced the decadent flapper fever from the Jazz Age, as sales of the 1920s style dress shot up since the launch of the box office hit, selling out in just two days.

George has also reported sales of its glamorous beaded collar blouse and vintage- style lace dress are up as shoppers are dazzled by the Gatsby film fashion.

Strings of pearls, flower headbands and corsages are also proving popular to recreate the vintage inspired look, and in response George has stocked the shelves with plenty to cope with soaring demand.

Brits’ beauty regimes are also taking a Twenties twist. George has reported a 45 per cent sales increase of red lipsticks with sales of its eye-popping and boldest red ‘Casino’ taking the top spot.

And it isn’t just the ladies that have been inspired, men are sharpening up their looks too with dashing George tuxedos and white shirts taking the lead. 

Tuxedos sales are up 41 per cent and white shirts are up 60 per cent in the last week as men emulate Gatsby’s suave style and dress to impress.

Fiona Lambert, George brand director said: 'Our beautiful beaded Charleston dress has been in high demand as women across the UK are inspired by the glamour of Carey Mulligan’s 1920s character, Daisy Buchanan.

'Even men are getting in on the action, smartening up and emulating the dapper male characters.

'We often see a sales uplift following new film releases and this glamorous box office smash is no exception.'

The twentines trend has also spilled on 
to the fashion catwalks in recent years, with Marc Jacobs, Gucci and 
Roberto Cavalli all causing a flapper frenzy with their SS13 
collections, and hitting the high street in time for Gatsby fever.
