Diane Keaton today reiterated her support of her friend and longtime collaborator Woody Allen following allegations of abuse made earlier this year by his daughter Dylan Farrow.

The 68-year-old actor appeared on the Today show on Tuesday to promote her latest memoir, Let's Just Say It Wasn't Pretty.

After charming presenter Matt Lauer by saying that she had looked up pictures of him on the Internet and that he had a 'nice chest', the conversation then turned to Allen.

Diane Keaton appeared on the Today show on Tuesday where she stood up for Woody Allen, calling him a 'genius'

Lauer asked if Keaton had any trepidation when accepting a lifetime achievement at the Golden Globes this year on the director's behalf.

Keaton replied that she would be 'nowhere' without Woody Allen, saying that he gave her 'the greatest gift anyone has ever given me' when he cast her in Annie Hall. She added: 'He's a genius.'

The 68-year-old, who won an Oscar for her role in Annie Hall, also said during the interview that she had coped with 'lifelong insecurity'.

She said that she regretted never getting married but no one had ever asked her. When she was younger 'becoming a movie star was my dream come true', Keaton said. 

She also talked about her past boyfriends including Warren Beatty but said: 'Warren married Annette Bening. That was a good choice.'

She also admitted that she was 'so in love' with Al Pacino while they were filming the Godfather in the early 1970s.

In an interview with People earlier this month, Keaton also defended Allen, who she was romantically involved with during the early days of her career.

She told the magazine: 'I love Woody. I don't want to say anything about [Dylan's accusations which he denies] except I'm Woody's friend and I believe him. That's the bottom line for me.

'I worry for him and everybody else involved, and I hope it works out the best for everyone.'

Revelation: Diane Keaton and ex-love Woody Allen in Annie Hall back in 1977. She has repeatedly defended the director following allegations of abuse from his adoptive daughter Dylan Farrow

Earlier this year, Dylan Farrow renewed allegations that her adoptive father Allen had molested her as a child, calling out some of Woody's famous collaborators - including Keaton - in a letter to the New York Times.

In the letter she accused her adoptive father of sexually assaulting her when she was seven-years-old and chastised Hollywood for nominating the director for a slew of awards.

'For so long, Woody Allenâ€™s acceptance silenced me,' she wrote. 'It felt like a personal rebuke, like the awards and accolades were a way to tell me to shut up and go away.

'What if it had been your child, Cate Blanchett? Louis CK? Alec Baldwin? What if it had been you, Emma Stone? Or you, Scarlett Johansson? You knew me when I was a little girl, Diane Keaton. Have you forgotten me?,' she asked.

Woody, 78, has denied all the allegations, saying in his open letter in 
the New York Times on February 7 that he blamed his ex-partner Mia 
Farrow for exploiting their adopted child, would be his 'final word' on 
the matter.

After
 reading the filmmaker's response, the 28-year-old released the 
following statement: 'Once again, Woody Allen is attacking me and my 
family in an effort to discredit and silence me - but nothing he says or
 writes can change the truth.'

'For
 20 years, I have never wavered in describing what he did to me. I will 
carry the memories of surviving these experiences for the rest of my 
life.'
