A father has told how he lost 7st in just six months after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at the age of 30.

Ryan Griffiths, 31, weighed 22st and lived off a diet of fast food until he saw a ‘shocking’ photograph of himself on a night out.

While his diabetes diagnosis was not enough to make him change his ways, the photo did the trick and he joined a gym and revolutionised his diet.

He now weighs 15st 3lb and his body fat percentage has dropped from 44 to 22. Between 10 to 20 per cent is the recommended level for men aged between 20 and 40.

He is hoping to get down to 14st with a body fat percentage of 15.

Impressively, he has also reversed his diabetes and no longer needs to take any medication for it.

Mr Griffiths, from Northampton, told MailOnline: ‘I used to bury my head in the sand – I deliberately avoided weighing myself.

‘When I saw a picture of myself on a night out I was shocked.’

Mr Griffiths, who has a two-year-old son called Joseph with his wife, Kate, used to live off a diet of McDonald’s for breakfast and lunch, numerous Costa coffees and dinners of frozen pizza.

Working as a mobile sales rep, he was constantly ‘pounding the motorways’ and took no exercise despite indulging in crisps and other unhealthy snacks between meals.

When he was just 30, he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

He said: ‘It runs in my family but the size of me didn’t help. I buried my head in the sand after the diagnosis and continued on as I was.

‘I took the medication I was given but I didn’t change my diet or alcohol intake.’

Ryan now weighs 15st 3lb and his body fat percentage has fallen from 44 to 22. He also reversed his diabetes

Mr Griffiths estimates that at this time he was consuming between 4,500 and 5,000 calories a day – twice the recommended daily intake for a man.

However, everything changed when he saw an unflattering photo of himself.

He said: ‘The picture was the proverbial straw. It made me do something.’

Mr Griffiths joined Pure Gym and slashed his daily calorie intake to between 1,600 and 1,800.

He now eats a high-protein, low-GI diet. On a typical day he has a protein shake before going to the gym at 5am and another one afterwards.

He then has boiled eggs at 10.30am, followed by an Innocent Veg Pot for lunch.

He snacks on protein bars and a typical dinner would be a jacket potato with vegetables and chicken.

As a result of his transformed diet and his weight loss, Mr Griffiths no longer has type 2 diabetes and he has been taken off all of his medication.

He said: ‘The diabetes nurse said I was only the second person she’d seen to reverse it.’

He added: ‘My wife is very pleased – she is pretty happy but we do keep having to buy me new clothes!’

Mr Griffiths added that his wife has also lost 2st 7lbs as a result of their new eating habits.

Going forward:  He now intends to continue going to the gym in the hope of reaching his target weight of 14st

He said: ‘It is also better for our son to see us eating healthy food.

‘I have much more energy now and can run around with him more.’

Mr Griffiths says he intends to continue going to the gym in the hope of reaching his target weight of 14st.

He also wants his body fat percentage to fall further. ge said: ‘I want to walk the middle line between muscles and cardio fitness.

‘I have that picture on my phone so it is always there if I need motivation.’
