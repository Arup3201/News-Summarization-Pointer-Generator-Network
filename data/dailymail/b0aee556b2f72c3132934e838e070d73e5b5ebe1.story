Reading FC player Matthew Partridge, 20, walked free from court despite admitting road rage attack that left motorcyclist's vision damaged

A young professional footballer who left a motorcyclist covered in blood and with damaged vision in one eye after a road rage incident has walked free from court.

Reading FC player Matthew Partridge, 20, beat James Mannion, 40, up so badly that he was left with sheets of skin hanging from his neck, lifelong scars and severe vision damage.

Partridge let rip when Mr Mannion asked for his insurance details after their vehicles collided at Woolhampton, near Newbury, last August.

Yesterday he wept in court as a judge told him she was giving him a suspended jail sentence for his 'disgusting, thuggish' behaviour as she wanted to give him a chance to pay back those who believed in him.'

Reading Crown Court heard how the assault happened early on 29 August last year when Partridge and Mr Mannion stopped in a lay-by after a crash.

When Partridge, from Thatcham, Berkshire, refused to give his insurance details to Mr Mannion, the victim began taking photographs of the footballer's Vauxhall Astra numberplate.

Prosecutor Lisa Goddard said: 'This defendant reacts badly to that and he assaults the victim.'

She said Partridge pushed Mr Mannion into a hedge before assaulting him again, holding him by the throat and punching him in the face three times.

The prosecutor continued: 'All he was doing was trying to get insurance details. He was doing it in as calm a manner as he could.'

Partridge claimed Mr Mannion had provoked him and that he was acting in self-defence, although he admitted a single count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

Eamonn Dolan, Reading Football Club’s academy manager, said Partridge, who earns £350 a week and lives with his parents, had been fined one month’s wages following the attack.

He told the court that Partridge had made a 'catastrophic' mistake, but said he had a good character.

And the academy’s safeguarding manager, David Downs, said he had he potential to make a career as a professional footballer.

He said: 'May I please ask that the sentence that is imposed does not destroy his potential career and does not destroy Matthew himself.'

The £350 a week footballer wept in the dock as Judge Angela Morris said she would suspend his jail term

Mitigating, Steve Molloy said Partridge was not a thug who went looking for trouble but had lost his temper with 'catastrophic consequences.'

Judge Angela Morris said: 'The thug who was behaving in that disgusting fashion on August 29 is a rather different person than is normally present with his employers at Reading Football Club.

 

'If you think that you have got away with it, you think again, young man'

  Judge Angela Morris, Reading Crown Court

'Thuggish behaviour of this nature will not be tolerated and it will be marked by sentences of imprisonment by the court.'

Sentencing a crying Partridge to 12 months' imprisonment, the judge agreed to suspend the jail term for two years, prompting sighs of relief from his family.

But she warned: 'If for one minute, Mr Partridge, you think that because I’m going to give you a chance today that you have got away with it, you think again right now young man.

'There are a lot of people who are prepared to invest time in you.

'I think it’s time for you to show them that you can respect the investment and the time that they have show in you by demonstrating that you can be the disciplined individual that they have spoken of.'

The court heard that Partridge, who was also ordered to do 240 hours of unpaid work and pay £2,000 compensation, had previously been cautioned for punching someone in a nightclub.
