Groves now faces charges of first and third-degree murder. 

Investigators recently reopened the homicide investigation in attempt to solve Heckel’s murder and brought it before a grand jury.

Heckel was 40-years-old when she disappeared in July of 1991. But her body has never been found.

A day after  she went missing, her family reported that she hadn’t returned home from work at international paper company in Lock Haven, according to WNEP-TV.

State police searched for her in the woods of Clinton County and found evidence of foul play. They also found her car in a hospital parking lot.

Yet, although Heckel’s body has not been located, a grand jury recently recommended murder charges against  Groves.

Heckel and Groves were coworkers at International Paper and had a brief romantic relationship during the summer of 1991, the grand jury heard.

Prosecutors say Groves killed Heckel after she told him she wanted to end their relationship and co-workers remember them fighting at work hours before she disappeared. 

Groves then allegedly  disposed of her body so that it would never be found. He is currently being held without bail.

Attorney General Kathleen Kane says she hopes Groves' arrest brings relief to Heckel's loved ones after years of uncertainty over her strange disappearance.
