Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud has been named Paddy Power's inaugural 'Hottest Premier League Player' after a landslide win.

A total of 250 American women were asked to rank 300 players from England's top flight and the dreamy Frenchman came out on top. 

In a cheekily charming acceptance speech, the striker was presented with a golden mirror and thanked his parents 'for making me this way' before also giving shout-outs to his team-mates, barber, botox technician, make-up artist, tailor and his selfie assistant, Gunners right-back Mathieu Debuchy.

Sunderland's Santiago Vergini was the runner-up to Giroud, while Leicester's Matty James also made the podium in third.

Paddy Power's research even produced a 'Hot XI' with Giroud spearheading the attack. 

Relegation battlers Burnley were deemed to have the hottest squad overall, but only defender Jason Shackell made the Hot XI.    

West Brom, Swansea and Newcastle were found to have the least desirable squads and occupied the relegation spots in Paddy Power's table. 

Hot XI: Ben Foster (Southampton), Santiago Vergini (Sunderland), Jason Shackell (Burnley), Erik Pieters (Stoke), Paul Konchesky (Leicester), Jesus Navas (Manchester City), Morgan Schneiderlin (Southampton), Matty James (Leicester), Nacer Chadli (Tottenham), Charlie Austin (QPR), Olivier Giroud (Arsenal).

Not XI: Gerhard Tremmel (Swansea), Ritchie De Laet (Leicester), James Collins (West Ham), Joleon Lescott (West Brom), Aly Cissokho (Aston Villa), Angel di Maria (Manchester United), Cheick Tiote (Newcastle), Stephen Quinn (Hull), Sadio Mane (Southampton), Mario Balotelli (Liverpool), Marouane Chamakh (Crystal Palace).
