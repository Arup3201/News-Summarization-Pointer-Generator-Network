Complaints: Andrew Schiff, who makes six figures, bemoans that his apartment doesn't have a dishwasher

Forget the one per cent. These guys are the WHINE per cent.

Several Wall Street bankers and execs have come forward to voice their discontent about just how daunting it is to survive on their six-figure salaries in interviews with Bloomberg.com.

Andrew Schiff, the communications and marketing director at Euro Pacific Capital, hates traffic just like most New Yorkers, but unlike most in the Big Apple, he’s feeling the crunch from a $350,000 salary.

Mr Schiff told Bloomberg: 'The New York that I wanted to have is still just beyond my reach'.

The Brooklyn resident lives in a pretty sizable apartment by New York City standards, but bemoans the fact that it came without a dishwasher.

Mr Schiff said. 'I'm crammed into 1,200 square feet. I don’t have a dishwasher. We do all our dishes by hand'.

He told the site that he needs a 600-square-foot extension for the place to allow 'a room for each kid, three bedrooms, maybe four'. 

'Imagine four bedrooms. You have the luxury of a guest room, how crazy is that?'

It's about as crazy as the worries of Alan Dlugash, a partner at accounting firm Marks Paneth & Shron LLP in Manhattan.

Mr Dlugash told Bloomberg: 'Could you imagine what it’s like to say I got three kids in private school, I have to think about pulling them out? How do you do that?'

He added: 'People who don’t have money don’t understand the stress'.

Mr Dlugash said he has been advising 
bankers about their expenses. ‘If you don’t cut that, then you’ve got to
 cut this,’ he told Bloomberg. ‘They say: “But I can’t”. And I say, “But
 you must”.’

Investment banks hit by falls in revenue are cutting back pay - with at least 25 per cent trimmed at Goldman Sachs and Barclays Capital.

Meanwhile the Wall Street cash bonus pool plummeted by 14 per cent last year to $19.7billion and the pay structure of most employees has changed, reported Bloomberg.

The average U.S. household income as a median was just shy of $50,000 in 2010 and more than 15 per cent of Americans now live in poverty.

But Richard Scheiner said that he and his wife have kept their heads above water because they have saved their money.

Still, the 58-year-old real estate 
investor and hedge fund manager admitted that he spends about $17,000 a 
year in expenses - for his dogs, and sold two of his motorcycles, 
according to Bloomberg.

At
 least he still has his Porsche 911 Carrera 4S Cabriolet, two Audis and 
his $7,500 a year membership at the Trump National Golf Club.

Wall Street headhunter Daniel Arbeeny has been reduced to coupon-cutting after a dramatic drop in his income.

Mr Arbeeny told Bloomberg: 'They have a circular that they leave in front of the buildings in our neighbourhood. We sit there, and I look through all of them to find out where it's worth going.

He even cut out his annual ski trips to Tahoe and Aspen to save money.

For people like Mr Schiff, the PR and marketing executive, it's all about the triumphs of achievement.

He told the website: 'I wouldn’t want to whine. All I want is the stuff that I always thought, growing up, that successful parents had'.
