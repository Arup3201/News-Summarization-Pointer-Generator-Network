They are already a common sight in San Francisco, but cars adorned with pink moustaches are set to be seen across Brooklyn and Queens, it has been revealed.

Car sharing service Lyft, Uber's arch rival, revealed today it will launch in New York on Friday for the first time.

The firm is known for its more relaxed attitude - drivers fist bump passengers when they get in the car, and there are even 'special' Lyft driver who have mirror balls and other customised themes for their cars.

Car sharing service Lyft, with cars adorned with pink moustaches are set to be seen across Brooklyn and Queens from Friday.

Lyft users open an app on their iOS or Android smartphones and signal drivers to pick them up and take them to their destinations. 

The app matches them with the nearest driver.

Drivers attach fluffy pink mustaches to their cars to identify themselves to passengers.

Instead of using official taxi operators or limousine service drivers, Lyft recruits regular people who wish to make extra money by offering rides in their own cars in exchange for 'donations' from passengers.

Some of Lyft's NYC founding drivers include a NY firefighter, a mother going back to school who runs a youth organization that revolves around teens and art, a honor student & MTA maintenance worker using Lyft to help pay off loans, a school teacher and father of three sons who are all actors, and a space suit designer

Drivers are screened with criminal background checks, and they must be licensed with the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.

'This week, we take a historic step forward in bringing community-powered transportation to all corners of the country, the firm said on its blog.

'After months of receiving unprecedented support from tens of thousands of residents, Lyft will launch in New York City on Friday at 7pm local time, with the outer boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens as our first communities.'

The firm said it chose the areas because of their lack of public transport.

'Brooklyn and Queens are vastly underserved by public transit options compared to the rest of New York City.

'In fact, just one of New York’s 23 subway lines passes solely between boroughs, and 95% of taxi pickups happen in Manhattan or a local airport.

'The people of New York deserve more transportation options. Lyft provides greater access to a safe, affordable personal transit alternative that is built for New Yorkers, by New Yorkers.'

Fans of the firm even began an online petition to persude it to open in New York.

The company, which is in more than 60 American cities, plans to have more than 500 Lyft drivers available when the service starts in New York, the firm said.

The Lyft allows allows people to hail their nearest car, and see information about the driver. Once the ride is complete, the passenger pays automatically uses a credit card held on file.

A Change.org petition launched by several outer borough residents has already garnered thousands of signatures, and more than 75,000 people have already opened the app to get a ride in New York City, the firm said.

'Now, residents and visitors looking to travel in between boroughs, get a ride to the closest subway station, or head out for a night on the town can easily request a safe and friendly ride.

'Not only does Lyft cost less than a cab, it also allows passengers to meaningfully connect with someone in their community as they share the ride.'

The firm said it has already signed up New York drivers and hoped to have 500 in place for Friday.

It also stressed it has a strict screening process for drivers.

'As always, safety is our top priority and every driver has undergone a screening process that is more stringent than what’s required for NYC taxis, including a strict background check, vehicle inspection and $1,000,000 insurance that provides more than three times the $300,000 minimum for taxis.'
