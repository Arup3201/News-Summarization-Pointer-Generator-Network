She is Britain’s first and only woman Prime Minister, and the longest-serving for 150 years.

But, despite her unique place in British history, the only monument to Lady Thatcher’s achievements in her home town of Grantham is a small plaque on the wall of the property where she grew up.

And that is the way it could stay, after disagreements over plans for a larger-than-life statue of the former premier.

Lady Thatcher stands next to the £150,000 white marble statue of her in 2002. Shortly after, it was famously decapitated by a protester. Now restored, it has been offered to the Grantham Museum

More than two decades after her fall 
from power, the Lincolnshire market town is split over whether to accept
the white marble artwork for display at Grantham Museum.

The museum said yesterday that any 
decision would be taken with the views of local residents in mind. The 
8ft £150,000 artwork by sculptor Neil Simmons was commissioned by the 
House of Commons and was decapitated by a protester within weeks of 
going on display at a gallery in the City of London in 2002.

It has spent much of the period since its repair in storage at the Commons.

Yesterday, the volunteer-run museum, 
which already boasts a Spitting Image puppet of Mrs Thatcher and one of 
her blue suits, said a decision had not yet been made about the offer of
the statue.

A Labour councillor in Grantham 
suggested that displaying a monument to Lady Thatcher could be ‘asking 
for trouble’. Charmaine Morgan said some of Lady Thatcher’s policies 
remain controversial and the statue might be open to more attacks if it 
was erected in her home town. ‘Placing it anywhere in a public place in 
Grantham, it could be open to a similar event occurring,’ Miss Morgan 
said. 

Lady Thatcher, who won three general 
elections and was Prime Minister between 1979 and 1990, was born and 
went to school in Grantham. But at the former grocery shop and post 
office where Margaret Hilda Roberts grew up, there is nothing more than a
small plaque.

The shop is now a holistic centre, and
her childhood bedroom is used for massage therapy. Despite calls from 
successive mayors for a statue of Lady Thatcher, her legacy seems to be 
so divisive that such proposals have never got beyond the planning 
stage. Grantham lies within Tory-controlled South Kesteven District 
Council.

The Neil Simmons statue was unveiled 
by the former prime minister in 2002, but attacked with a metal pole at 
Guildhall Art Gallery by theatre producer Paul Kelleher two months 
later.

Jayne Robb, manager of Grantham 
Museum, said: ‘It does need to go somewhere, but how the town responds 
to the life of Margaret Thatcher has to be a town decision.’

Grantham already has a statue and 
shopping centre dedicated to a famous son, Sir Isaac Newton, and many 
think it is time for Lady Thatcher, now 87, to be honoured.

‘If you were walking through the town 
you would never know she had anything to do it,’ said poultry manager 
Duncan Attwood, 39. ‘Tourists come from all over the world because it is
where she is from.’

Teaching assistant Michelle Carter, 
33, added: ‘A lot of things she did weren’t popular with Labour voters 
but she was our first woman prime minister and for that she should be 
recognised. Who knows when the next one will come along?’

A bronze statue of Lady Thatcher, unveiled in 2007, stands in the Members’ Lobby at the House of Commons.

The former British Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street with David Cameron in 2010. A Labour councillor suggested that displaying a monument to Lady Thatcher in a prominent place could be 'asking for trouble'

The grocer's daughter, who went on to be PM from 1979 until 1990, was born in Grantham and went to Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School. She is seen above visiting the school in 1982
