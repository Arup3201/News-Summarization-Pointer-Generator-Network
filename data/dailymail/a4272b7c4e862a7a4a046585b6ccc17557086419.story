Birdman may have taken four Oscars at last night's star-studded awards, but Lady Gaga stole the show on Twitter.

The singer's tribute to The Sound of Music while joined on stage by Julie Andrews saw the most tweets per minute (TPM) - and it was discussed more than when Birdman won the Best Picture accolade. The pop star was also the most tweeted-about star of the show.

This was all revealed thanks to a special interactive Twitter heat map, created to plot spikes in traffic around the globe as the Oscars award show was broadcast from Los Angeles.

During last night's show, Scarlett Johansson introduced Lady Gaga to the stage in a tribute to The Sound Of Music.

Lady Gaga, whose real name is Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta,  performed a rendition of The Hills Are Alive and was joined on stage by Julie Andrews, who played Maria von Trapp in the 1965 film. 

The moment that received the second most TPM was towards the end of the event, at 21.03, when Sean Penn awarded the Best Picture Oscar for Birdman.

The award was accepted by producer James Skotchdopole, director Alejandro Iñárritu and producer John Lesher.

And in third place was Best Supporting Actress winner Patricia Arquette's acceptance speech at 18.53. 

She won the award for her portrayal of Olivia Evans in Richard Linklater's Boyhood. 

Ms Arquette used her speech to highlight pay inequality in Hollywood.   

During her speech, she said: 'To every woman who gave birth, to every taxpayer and citizen of this nation, we have fought for everybody else’s equal rights.

'It's our time to have wage equality once and for all and equal rights for women in the United States of America.'
