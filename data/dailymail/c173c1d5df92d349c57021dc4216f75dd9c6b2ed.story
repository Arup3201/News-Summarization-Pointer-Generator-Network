The captain of a cruise ship carrying 136 passengers was left red-faced after managing to get stuck on a sandbank.

The Lady Busum had landed on the beach near the small island of Trischen in Germany, but was left high and dry as the tide went out.

The passengers had to wait for eight hours before rescuers arrived to take them home.

Stranded: 136 passengers were stuck on the Lady Busum for eight hours after it managed became marooned on a sandbank

But the ship's crew had to remain on board and wait until the tide came back and they were then able to get the ship free under its own steam.

A rescue worker said: 'Two passengers were rescued earlier due to medical reasons and were taken to land for medical treatment. It was an upsetting experience.'

The boat was then sent into dock to check to see if it had been damaged by the incident.

River police have launched an inquiry to work out what went wrong and how it was that the cruise ship ended up beached.

Relief: Passengers were finally able to leave the cruise ship after a rescue boat arrived to take them home
