When a group of travellers chose their latest settlement, it seems they underestimated the quality of the opposition.

They found themselves pitched against the hardy regulars of Hoghton Cricket Club, and from that point there was only going to be one winner.

Invoking ‘the spirit of the Ashes’, as the village cricketers themselves put it, and with a little help from Twitter, they defended their turf throughout the night with a human barricade.

Victory for the cricket team: Travellers cleared from pitch after trying to set up camp in Hoghton, Lancashire

Battle: Members of Hoghton Cricket Club formed a human barricade around their pitch to stop more travellers setting up camp

Stand off: Police talk to players and supporters from Hoghton Cricket Club who refused to let more travellers invade their pitch

The rearguard action began after 
caravans and a motorhome entered the ground, near Preston, on Monday 
morning, and locals reported dozens more people asking for directions to
the pitch.

Cricket club chairman Neil Eccles, 50,
one of the first on the scene, said: ‘This just isn’t the place for an 
invasion of travellers. It is a nice rural village and there were lots 
of people walking past who were horrified by what they saw.

‘We put the word out, used Twitter to 
rally the local community and managed to barricade the entrance to stop 
any more caravans getting on and ruining our ground.’

Players and staff from the local 
league champions side, including president Rory McDonald, 51, set up a 
rota to stand guard for 24 hours.

In that time, Mr Eccles claimed, the travellers left rubbish on the wicket and human waste on the outfield.

One motorhome even parked on the square, lovingly tended by Mr Eccles’s brother Darren, 40, the groundsman.

Mr Eccles said: ‘Darren spends hours and hours on the ground when he’s not working or playing for our second team.

‘That was our worst fear, so when they
moved from the outfield to the square we went over to remonstrate and 
they just laughed in our faces.’

Fighting back: Club president Rory McDonald with the trailer which was used to block out the travellers

Fury: Although the field has now been cleared, the club says the travellers damaged the cricket square and left rubbish and faeces

Police were called to the ground in 
the shadow of historic Hoghton Tower, and stayed overnight to prevent an
altercation. The travellers left just before midday yesterday.

Captain Phil Hurst, 30, who manned the
barricade until 7.15am before going to his job as a bank manager in 
Manchester, said it was a ‘victory for team spirit’.

He added: ‘Everyone at the club has other day jobs, but we got a rota going and all the lads have given up their time.

‘Preparing one wicket for a game on 
Saturday takes our groundsman five hours and for them to come on and 
wreck it is soul destroying.

‘When more of their convoy turned up in the night, the lads on the  barricade blocked them out and turned them away.’

Police were able to secure an 
eviction notice only after the club had to cancel a series of events. Mr
Eccles said: ‘The club had to cancel its under 11s and under 13s 
practice night, leaving 50 local youngsters disappointed, but this 
inadvertently resulted in the  gypsies having to leave.

‘The police were able to serve an 
eviction notice because they are interfering with community events, 
otherwise their hands would have been tied.’

Dispute: Police were called in to prevent a 'breach of the peace' as the stand off continued

Barricade: A local tradesman volunteered to park his lorry in front of the entrance to keep travellers out

The stand-off began at 11am
on Monday when a local called Mr McDonald to warn him there were four 
vehicles on the outfield.

Mr McDonald rang Mr Eccles’s other 
brother Russell, 48, a farmer and the club’s opening batsman, who made a
blockade with his car. They called in reinforcements in the form of a 
tradesman’s lorry, and other players quickly arrived.

Mr Eccles said: ‘We heard there were dozens more caravans in the village asking for the postcode. It was intimidating.

‘They were very aggressive and quoted 
every bylaw in the book to prove they were right. They weren’t open for 
discussion and told us they had every right to be there.

‘They threatened to stay for days. But
we stood our ground and took turns to man the barricade. I don’t think 
they realise how much volunteer effort goes into the club.’

Victory: The club formed a barricade to prevent more travallers entering and they were eventually removed after the police and council were able to obtain a court order

Team effort: Mr Eccles said the players drew on the spirit of England's national team who are competing for the Ashes against Australia this summer

Lancashire Police said: ‘We were called to Hoghton Cricket Club at 12.33pm on Monday to reports of four caravans on the pitch.

‘Members of the local community placed
a vehicle across the entrance of the car park and prevented further 
entry.

'That continued throughout the night and we remained at the scene 
to prevent a breach of the peace.’
