Intelligence agencies are closing the net on the masked ISIS executioner known as Jihadi John, Philip Hammond has revealed.

The Foreign Secretary, who just ten days ago admitted special forces didn't know where the Islamic terror group was holding its British hostages, said the investigation into tracking down the killer with the British accent was 'narrowing down the field'.

Speaking to American television network CNN at the United Nations summit in New York, Mr Hammond said: 'We are getting warm, we are working on all the leads.

'There's a big investigation and we are getting warm.  We're narrowing down the field, but I don't want to say any more at this stage.'

The Foreign Secretary also condemned the continuing hostage situation involving British aid worker Alan Henning, 47, after ISIS, also known as ISIL, sent an audio recording to his wife, Barbara, in which he pleads for his life.

Mr Hammond told Wolf Blitzer, host of the Situation Room show: 'What we do know is Alan Henning was out there simply to help. 

'He was a humanitarian worker who went with an aid convoy organised by British Muslim groups to provide support to refugees in Syria.

'He was doing good and I think it speaks volumes about ISIL that this is the way they are treating somebody who went out there to help their people and support their communities in their time of need.'

The audio recording came after the United States and Arab allies began bombing parts of Syria where ISIS have gained a foothold, reportedly including the city of Raqqa where it is thought the former Salford taxi driver is being held. 

Mr Henning, who appeared at the end of a video of the murder of British aid worker David Haines, was kidnapped last December in Syria by ISIS militants and Mrs Henning has again pleaded for them to release him.

In a statement issued by the Foreign Office, Mrs Henning said: 'We are at a loss [to understand] why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan's imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life...

'He went to Syria to help his Muslim friends deliver much needed aid.'

The militant extremist group has previously released footage showing the killings of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff as well as Mr Haines. The man known as Jihadi John is believed to appear in all three videos and seems to speak with a British accent.

A separate video released this week showed British photojournalist John Cantlie sitting at a desk reading from a prepared script and explaining that he would speak about ISIS in future videos.

There was no threat to kill Mr Cantlie made on camera.

When asked by Mr Blitzer about the UK policy of not paying ransoms to terrorists, Mr Hammond said 'absolutely right', and added he did not believe the Turkish government had paid for the release last weekend of 49 hostages held by ISIS.

Ten days ago Mr Hammond was criticised for admitting that special forces did not know where ISIS was holding its British hostages.

Explaining why no SAS operation had been mounted to release hostages including Mr Henning and Mr Cantlie, the Foreign Secretary said: 'If we knew where they were, it would be a different story, but we don't.'

His remarks were criticised by the former head of the Army, Richard Dannatt, who said he was 'surprised' Mr Hammond had spoken so freely.

Lord Dannatt said: 'At the public level, not to have commented in that way would have kept uncertainty in the minds of terrorists. They would have remained concerned...

'Not to have revealed our hand as openly might have been a different course of action to take. He was trying to be open and helpful, but it might have been better to say that to the family privately. He would appear to have shown our hand.'
