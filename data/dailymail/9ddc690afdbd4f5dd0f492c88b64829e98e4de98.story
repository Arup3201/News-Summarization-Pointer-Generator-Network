Coronation Street star Bill Roache today paid a visit to the 'Circle of Love', the mystical spiritual sect he has turned to for support throughout his child sex abuse trial.

The actor, who was this week found not guilty of rape and indecent assault, was joined by daughter Verity on the trip to the holistic centre in Ashton-under-Lyne, Manchester.

Mr Roache, who has been a devotee of the Pure Love Movement for several years, was greeted warmly with hugs from fellow members after arriving for a two-hour meeting.

He was pictured visiting the group in June last year after being charged with historic sex offences and again following the first day of the trial in January.

The motto of the Circle of Love is to share 'wisdom, knowledge, but above all, love' and meetings involve meditation, reiki - a form of healing using mystic vibrations - and discussions where members share messages from the spirit realm.

The main message of the group is that love conquers all. They seek to 'empower each person to recognise their own knowing, their own truth' and welcome people from any religion.

Yesterday Coronation Street producers confirmed Mr Roache will be back playing Ken Barlow by the summer.

The
 actor, who has been in the soap since its first episode in 1960, has 
not appeared since last May when scriptwriters sent his character to 
Canada.

Following his not 
guilty verdict, an ITV spokesman said: 'We look forward to talking to 
Bill about his return,' with sources saying he will start filming scenes
 in April to be shown from July onwards.

Past
 and present cast members have rushed to celebrate his acquittal, but 
also slammed the 'wasteful' and 'nonsense' decision to prosecute him.

The
 jury took less than six hours to reject allegations made by five women 
dating back almost half a century, leading to furious claims the case 
had been brought as part of a ‘celebrity witch-hunt’.

Roache's
 QC said the ‘spectre’ of Jimmy Savile had haunted the inquiry since the
 start and led police to single out the actor for unfair treatment due 
to his celebrity status.

Nazir Afzal, the Chief Crown 
Prosecutor for North West England, has said it had been right for the 
allegations against Roache to be put before a jury, insisting his 
celebrity status made no difference.

But
 barrister Neil Addison, a former Senior Crown Prosecutor, said: ‘I do 
think that there is a witch hunt in the sense of the post-Savile era.’

Roache
 is the third Coronation Street actor to be cleared of sex offences in 
the past year, after actors Michael Le Vell and Andrew Lancel were both 
found not guilty following trials last year.

Cast members admitted they were furious about the latest case.

Actor Ken Morley, who played Reg Holdsworth in the soap alongside him, said: 'Another waste of public money.

'Considering the Michael Le Vell farce, they should be careful about the waste of taxpayers money.

'My heart goes out to Bill. We all knew it was nonsense from the outset.

'It is part of the Jimmy Savile witch hunt - this all followed the demise of the repulsive DJ from Yorkshire.'

Sherrie Hewson, who played Maureen Webster and is a friend of Bill Roache said: 'It's made me really well up. It's just that we've all backed him for so long and I just thank God for this day.

'We all know Bill. We've worked with him, we know of his innocence and we knew right from the beginning - this should never ever have gone this far. and it's made me so cross'.
