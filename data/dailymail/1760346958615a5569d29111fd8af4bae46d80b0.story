A poignant letter written by a dying woman to her two daughters explaining why she had left half her estate to her toyboy lover was revealed yesterday.

Elizabeth Walker reminded  the pair they had previously received ‘substantial sums’ and that she had given up an inheritance from her own mother, urging her to leave her estate to them instead.

She also begged her daughters to ‘understand and respect my decisions’ and hailed her younger lover  as a ‘faithful partner’ who ‘will need this support’.

Heartbreaking explanation: Sisters Alison and Jennifer had fought to keep the letter secret, but today it was revealed to the High Court

IT analyst Michael Badmin, 35, is 
fighting Alison ‘Ally’ Walker, 31, and Jennifer Rowan, 32, for a share 
of their mother’s £1.2 million farm set in 90 acres in Garlinge Green, 
near Canterbury, Kent.

Mrs 
Walker died aged 53 in February 2010 from a brain tumour, barely a month
 after creating her will, which left half of her estate to Mr Badmin, 
with the other half split between her daughters.

The
 daughters claim their mother was in a ‘delusional and irrational’ state
 when she signed the will and have asked a judge to tear it up.

Mr
 Badmin, from Sittingbourne, Kent, insists he should receive the money. 
He was in his early 20s when he met Mrs Walker and their relationship 
‘began in earnest’ over Christmas 2005, the High Court in London was 
told. The couple kept their relationship quiet until Mrs Walker 
separated from her husband John, a property developer now aged 67. She 
was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2009, apparently cutting her 
daughters out of their expected inheritance just months later.

In
 her letter to her family, explaining her decision to give a huge chunk 
of her fortune to her lover, Mrs Walker said she hoped the ‘division’ of
 her estate was ‘adequate’, as ‘I want you all to be content’.

‘I
 wanted to provide a benefit that would not only support Michael, but 
one which would then go to help my family, so I hope you all understand 
and feel that this is reasonable,’ she wrote.

‘I
 feel I have done my best to provide for Ally and Jenny throughout my 
life, and that you have both received substantial sums in terms of 
inheritance over the years, which has given you both a good start to 
your adult lives. I forwent my inheritance from my mother, requesting 
her to leave it to both [of] you instead of taking it myself – so I hope
 you appreciate that I have tried to do my best for you as I care for 
you very much.

‘Your father 
has not helped throughout the divorce process and sadly decided not to 
agree to what I feel I should have been entitled to by law, using my low
 life expectancy against me over the course of the mediation process.

‘It
 was hard for him to come to an agreement, which I feel he should have 
made more effort to come to under the circumstances, especially given my
 prognosis.

‘As you know I 
have decided to split my remaining estate between you all, giving 25 per
 cent to Jenny, 25 per cent to Ally, with Michael receiving 50 per cent 
as he has been my faithful partner for several years and I feel he will 
need this support.’

Mrs Walker also said she had cut her husband John out of her will, because of his ‘obstructiveness’ in finalising their divorce.

She
 went on: ‘For Jenny and Ally, I feel your father should be able to help
 you as the divorce settlement looks ultimately to be in his favour and 
that I have given you the best I could in terms of bringing you up and 
being a mother. I have always tried to give you both the best of 
everything I have been able to, and I will always love you and your 
children dearly.’

Miss 
Walker and Mrs Rowan claim their mother ‘failed utterly to engage in the
 process’ of making a will and relied on Mr Badmin to help draft it.

Deputy High Court Judge Nicholas Strauss QC released the letter written by Mrs Walker, despite her daughters’ objections.

The dispute centres on Mrs Walker’s mental capacity at the time the will was created.

The case continues.

Dear All,

As you will know I have left you all a division of my estate. I hope you feel that it is adequate given the circumstances as I want you all to be content.

As you will now know, Michael has a lifetime interest in any property that I own, which will then pass on to Jenny and Ally.

I would like to ask that [daughters] Jenny and Ally both make a Will to ensure that this may pass on to Phoebe and Owen, so that they may one day benefit from this, as is my intention.

I wanted to provide a benefit that would not only support Michael, but one which would then go to help my family, so I hope you all understand and feel that this is reasonable.

I feel I have done my best to provide for Ally and Jenny throughout my life, and that you have both received substantial sums in terms of inheritance over the years, which has given you both a good start to your adult lives.

I forwent my inheritance from my Mother, requesting her to leave it to both [of] you instead of taking it myself - so I hope you appreciate that I have tried to do my best for you as I care for you very much.

Your father has not helped throughout the divorce process and sadly decided not to agree to what I feel I should have been entitled to by law, using my low life expectancy against me over the course of the mediation process.

It was hard for him to come to an agreement, which I feel he should have made more effort to come to under the circumstances, especially give my prognosis.

As you know I have decided to split my remaining estate between you all, giving 25% to Jenny, 25% to Ally, with Michael receiving 50% as he has been my faithful partner for several years and I feel he will need this support.

Due to John’s obstructiveness in finalising the divorce, we were unsure as to how much money would be left after our pressing expenses and the care I most likely will require throughout my illness.

I hope there is enough to to help you in some way.

John was uninterested in any of the above which saddened me greatly and I only hope he someday realises his unsympathetic view to my situation.

John Vincent Walker has been excluded from my Will for this reason.

Considering the possible future and writing this Will has been very hard for me, but the most important thing is that I wish the best for you all and my grandchildren in the future.

I do hope you all understand and respect my decisions.

For Jenny and Ally, I feel your father should be able to help you as the divorce settlement looks ultimately to be in his favour and that I have given you the best I could in terms of bringing you up and being a mother.

I have always tried to give you both the best of everything I have been able to, and I will always love you and your children dearly.

I love you all,

Best wishes,

Mum/Liz
