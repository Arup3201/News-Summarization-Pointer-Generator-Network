Israeli Defense Forces killed a 14-year-old Palestinian-American in a West Bank village Friday.

Orwah Hammad, who grew up in New Orleans and traveled to the West Bank when he was six, was shot in the head, as violence flares in Jerusalem and the West Bank.

On Wednesday, a Palestinian drove a car through a train station in Jerusalem, killing a three-month-old infant — also an American citizen — and injuring eight in what police called a terrorist attack.

Killed: Orwah Hammad, 14, became the second teenager killed in the West Bank by Israeli Defense Forces when he was shot in the head on Friday 

Conflicting reports have surfaced regarding the circumstances of Hammad's shooting.

Soldiers 'managed to prevent an attack when they encountered a Palestinian man hurling a molotov cocktail at them on the main road next to Silwad,' an anonymous spokesperson for the Israeli army told Reuters.

Hammad's cousin Moath claims that he was with a group of Palestinian boys throwing rocks at soldiers. 

'I don't call that a clash — little kids throwing rocks or pebbles against live ammunition,' said an uncle, Hakeem Khalek, said an uncle from New Orleans. 

'This all happens overseas, where kids throw rocks at military jeeps. And of course the Israeli army returned fire (and) we're not talking rubber bullets.'

US State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki expressed hope for a 'speedy and transparent investigation' into the shooting.

Youth: Hammad was born in the West Bank, living for a short period in New Orleans before returning to Palestine when we was six

Protests: Palestinian youth were in the streets protesting on Saturday after Hammad was killed as US State Department calls for a 'speedy and transparent investigation'

Psaki expressed condolences to the boy's family, and said that US officials will be 'closely engaged with the local authorities, who have the lead on this investigation.' 

Another US State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly, confirmed that Hammad was a US citizen.  

Hammad was born in the West Bank territory and spent a year in the US before returning to Palestine with his mother and five siblings. His father is an American citizen with roots in Palestine.

'He wanted Orwah to learn the culture,' said Khalek. 'He really wanted the kids to be brought up in the culture our generation was brought up in.'

Khalek said the father was heading to the West Bank after leaving New Orleans Friday evening.

Relations have improved little in the West Bank since the August ceasefire between Israel and various Palestinian armed groups.

Hammad's death follows the shooting of a 13-year-old eight days ago and 12 other Palestinians were wounded in street clashes with Israeli soldiers on Friday.
