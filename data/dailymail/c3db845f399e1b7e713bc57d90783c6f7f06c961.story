Town hall chiefs are spending £150,000 on accurately measuring the amount of grass, shrubs and hedges that need cutting in all of their borough's green spaces, it was revealed today.

Basildon Council in Essex said it needs the nine-month exercise ahead of a re-tendering next year - with English Landscapes, which has cut the grass since 2010, coming to the end of its contract.

Land surveying firm Atlantic Geomatics, based in Penrith, Cumbria, has now been hired to measure the borough’s greenery so the council can specify how much grass must be mowed.

Nigel Smith, leader of Basildon’s opposition Labour group, which opposed the council privatising the service in 2010, said the expenditure ‘does sound like a bit of a shambles’.

He added: ‘We opposed the privatisation of the contract in the first place, and I think we have been proved right. It would have been so much better if it was council staff carrying out these jobs.

‘One hundred and fifty thousand pounds is a load of money to be paying out on top of a contract to another company afterwards and you need to wonder about the competency of the council.’

The council said it must make sure that cutting contracts offered to companies are accurate. This means that £150,000 must be spent before a new grass cutting company can even be employed.

The re-measuring exercise will take nine months to complete, and also includes an assessment of what obstacles - such as bollards and pylons - could hinder the new grass cutting efforts.

The last re-measuring took place in 2008
at a third of the cost - £45,000 - but Tory councillor Kevin Blake said
that this was a poor job that led to issues with the English Landscapes
contract.

Kevin Blake, councillor for leisure 
and arts, said: ‘It’s a lot of money, I make no bones about that, but 
we’re talking about a huge project here.

'It
will go into the fine details rather than a finger in the air job. I 
don’t want to spend £50,000 and then run into problems later down the 
line. What you pay for is what you get.’

Eager gardener: The exercise is reminiscent of Mr Fussy from the Mr Men children's book series, who always insisted on ensuring every blade of his grass was straight and that his flowers all grew in a straight line

The council added that Atlantic 
Geomatics has the specialist equipment required to carry out the 
project, and it is a sophisticated process with the data being recorded 
and stored electronically.

The
council served 61 rectification notices and 40 default notices to 
English Landscapes in a six-month period shortly after the grass-cutting
was privatised.

TaxPayers'
Alliance campaign manager Eleanor McGrath said: ‘Local residents will 
be absolutely aghast at the amount of money Basildon Council is paying 
these expensive contractors for this ludicrous project.

‘Taxpayers want to know that their 
council is spending their hard-earned cash on frontline and essential 
services, not on bizarre exercises like this. Basildon Council needs to 
rethink its spending priorities at once, put local residents first and 
deliver far better value for money for local residents.’

The exercise is reminiscent of the green-fingered Mr Fussy 
character from the Mr Men children's book series, who always insisted on ensuring 
every blade of his grass was straight and that his flowers all grew in a
straight line.

But a Basildon Council spokesman told MailOnline: ‘This is a major and vital piece of work that has to be done in preparation for the next tender exercise in 2014 which will be for a contract that has a value of up to £1.5million per year.

'We have to recount obstacles and re-measure shrubs and hedges across the entire Borough which is 42.5 sq miles.

'This is to make sure the information we have is up to date and will ensure that we get value for money from the next contract that we award, which is worth millions of pounds.

'The last re-measuring exercise took place in 2008 and cost around £45,000. However, the new re-measuring exercise is more expensive because it will be a much more sophisticated process, with information being recorded electronically.'
