Fined: It was the second embarrassment in a matter of weeks for TV chef Jamie Oliver's empire

His restaurants boast of their eco-friendly credentials and he has featured in Government-funded recycling campaigns.

But it seems that not every corner of Jamie Oliver’s empire is singing from the chef’s sustainability songsheet, after it was revealed that one of his restaurants has been fined for breaking recycling rules.

For two years Jamie’s Italian neglected to recycle its packaging waste, the Environment Agency said, and the firm has been asked to pay a penalty in the form of a £6,000 donation to an environmental charity.

It was the second embarrassment in a matter of weeks for the TV chef’s empire.

Last month it was disclosed that his upmarket butcher’s shop in the City of London had to close temporarily after inspectors found mouse droppings and mouldy carcasses.

Jamie’s Italian fell out with the state waste regulator following the chain’s rapid expansion three years ago. Its managers, the Environment Agency said, ignored their responsibilities to recover and recycling packaging waste under 2007 regulations.

A spokesman for the Environment Agency said the company ‘had failed to register with a packaging waste recovery scheme for two years, and failed to take reasonable steps to recover and recycle packaging waste.’

She added: ‘Jamie’s Italian Ltd was 
not complying with packaging waste regulations, however the company has 
since changed the way it operates and volunteered a financial 
contribution of £5,904 to the Young People’s Trust for the Environment.

Breaking the rules: For two years Jamie's Italian neglected to recycle its packaging waste, the Environment Agency said, and the firm has been asked to pay a penalty in the form of a £6,000 donation to a charity

‘Civil sanctions such as these are a proportionate and cost-effective way for 
businesses to make amends for less serious environmental offences.’

The
 ‘enforcement undertaking for environment offences’ was accepted by the 
Agency between February and May this year, the Agency said in its notice
 published yesterday.

Jamie 
Oliver’s restaurant interests have expanded in recent years, at the same
 time as he has used his celebrity to campaign for better food for 
schoolchildren and encourage employment of youngsters in the food 
industry.

Environmental 
concerns have been prominent among his interests. His austerity 
cookbook, which advises people on how to avoid waste, has been promoted 
by the Government-funded Love Food Hate Waste campaign, and restaurants 
underline their commitment to recycling.

One
 recently-established American-themed Oliver restaurant in London 
promised that its manager would ‘use his expertise to recycle, re-use 
and upcycle large quantities’ of uneaten food.

Mr Oliver’s Fifteen restaurant in Cornwall proclaims that staying in business ‘means being sustainable.

Closed for a day: Barbecoa, his upmarket butcher's shop in London, had to close temporarily in January after inspectors found mouse droppings and mouldy carcasses. Chefs Mr Oliver and Adam Perry are pictured there

'Across the board. We focus on sustainability in all areas from energy usage, recycling, sourcing and conservation.’

The
 chef has praised fast food chain McDonald’s because ‘recycling is being
 improved and improved’, and in 2012, one of its managers told a 
newspaper that it was adopting Tetra Pak wine supplies, intended for 
easier recycling, because the system was ‘eco-friendly’.

'Jamie's Italian Ltd was not complying with packaging waste regulations'

Environment Agency spokesman

A
 spokesman for Jamie’s Italian said: ‘The penalty dates back to 2011 
when, during a period of substantial growth of the restaurant business, 
we voluntarily contacted the Environment Agency after becoming aware 
that it was likely we had reached the threshold concerning the recycling
 of packaging.

‘With their 
guidance, we made some necessary changes and implemented a new data 
collection process for waste packaging materials which has now been in 
place for the past three years.’

Mr
 Oliver’s City butcher’s shop Barbecoa closed for a day after public 
health officers gave it a score of one out of five in January.

A
 Freedom of Information request found that inspectors found carcasses 
with mould growing on them, dirty machinery and meat past its use-by 
date. Chicken had been relabelled with a later use-by date.
