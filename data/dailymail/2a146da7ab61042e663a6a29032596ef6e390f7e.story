Vivien Leigh kissing Clark Gable in Gone With The Wind

Gone With The Wind star Vivien Leigh was twice deemed unsuitable for a damehood – with her fragile mental health and scandalous affairs possible reasons for the snub.

Two unidentified experts who were asked to consider Leigh’s suitability vetoed the honour when she was twice considered in 1952 and 1954.

They deemed the actress – who had fallen for Sir Laurence Olivier when married, and also had an affair with actor Peter Finch – suitable only for a lower-ranking CBE. In the end she was not honoured at all.

The comments are revealed in Cabinet Office papers obtained by this newspaper under Freedom of Information laws.

It is not clear whether the individuals quoted were civil servants, politicians or other experts consulted as part of the honours process.

One of the pair writes: ‘There are contrary opinions about her merits as an actress.

'Personally I think she is underrated, and see no reason why she should not have a CBE [Commander of the British Empire] but certainly not a DBE [Dame Commander of the British Empire].’

The other wrote: ‘I am a great admirer of Vivien Leigh as an actress both stage and film.

‘Apart from her gifts as an actress, she has won great public admiration for the courage with which she has in recent years faced illness.

‘Personally I doubt whether she is at present quite what may be called “The Dame Class”, eg Edith Evans, Sybil Thorndike. I, therefore, venture to express the view that CBE appears to be more appropriate than DBE.’

The star was 39 at the time of the first snub and was enjoying huge international acclaim for her performances in the film and stage versions of the Tennessee Williams classic A Streetcar Named Desire.

But she had suffered from lifelong depression and had  previously taken an overdose on the set of Gone With The Wind in 1938 – the film in which Clark Gable as Rhett Butler famously told her: ‘Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn.’

In 1953 she went on to suffer a complete mental breakdown after having an affair with co-star Finch while filming Elephant Walk.

She was replaced in her role by Elizabeth Taylor and admitted to a psychiatric hospital.

Leigh’s biographer Hugo Vickers believes that legendary actor Olivier could have been behind at least one snub.

He said: ‘I think it quite possible that she was turned down because she was too beautiful and too feminine. She clearly didn’t fit the idea of a theatrical Dame at that time.

‘But these individuals would have been aware that she had health problems and that she had been married twice. Clearly these things still mattered in the Fifties.

'I just wonder if Olivier himself had any input into the matter, because he was such a powerful figure in the theatre world.

'He was jealous of her always and so beastly to her basically that he could easily have said, “I don’t think she would want such a thing.” ’

Mr Vickers said it is unlikely the actress, who was married to Olivier from 1940 to 1960, would have been aware of or bothered by the snub.

The newly released papers also show 
that the CBE bestowed on Lord Of The Flies author William Golding was 
delayed for a year because officials sent a letter informing him of the 
honour to the wrong address.

And actor Dirk Bogarde was knighted in 1992 only because his career was almost over and that the honour was ‘overdue’.

A
Downing Street memo dated July 12, 1965, and headed Honours – In 
Confidence states: ‘William Golding will presumably remain on the list 
for consideration and should, in my view, automatically, go into the 
next list: it can hardly be held against him that we were not able to 
deliver the letter offering his CBE in the birthday [honours] list.’

Of Bogarde’s, one official notes the actor ‘is described by the British Film Institute as a legendary talent, he is now close to the end of his acting career. An honour is overdue’.

The papers show that political affiliations appear regularly to have influenced decision-making behind honours.

Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan blocked a CBE for the Right-wing author Kingsley Amis in the 1979 Honours List.

A Downing Street minute dated November 20, 1978, reads: ‘The Prime Minister has given consideration to his recommendations for the New Year Honours List 1979. The Prime Minister does not wish to include Kingsley Amis.’

Amis was later knighted in 1990 when Tory Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister.
