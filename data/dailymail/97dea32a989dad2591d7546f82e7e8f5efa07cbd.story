Critical: Catrin Pugh, 19, is in hospital after her coach crashed in the French Alps

The father of a British ski instructor
in an artificial coma after a coach crash in the French Alps 
says he has been overwhelmed by messages of support.

Catrin Pugh is among three Britons critically ill in hospital after their coach turned 
ploughed into a mountainside near Alpe d'Huez and exploded.

The 19-year-old's father travelled from their home in Wrexham to Grenoble yesterday to be at her bedside.

In a statement he said: 'We would like
to thank everyone for their kind wishes and support, particularly 
British Foreign Office officials and SkiBound representatives who have 
been excellent.

'The hospital are doing all they can 
and have been most kind.

'We have been overwhelmed by the good wishes and
support from everybody.

'We would now be very grateful if everyone would respect our privacy at this difficult time.'

The distraught father's words came as 
French police investigating the bus crash prepared to travel to the UK 
to interview officials from the British coach company.

The news follows an announcement that 
the public prosecutor in Grenoble is to open an investigation into 
'involuntary homicide and injuries' after the driver of the bus died.

Aside from Ms Pugh, two other British 
nationals remain in a critical condition in hospital and a further 23 of
the 52 passengers were also injured in the horror crash on Tuesday 
afternoon.

It is understood that the main line of investigation is brake failure.

Witnesses have told police that 
moments before the smash, driver Maurice Wrightson, 64, from 
Northumberland, had frantically tried to warn passengers that there was a
catastrophic problem with the brakes.

He bravely tried to steer the 12-ton 
bus - which was towing a further three tons of luggage - to safety, 
managing to stop it plunging over a cliff.

It finally crashed into the side of 
the road and the fuel tank at the front of the bus exploded, tearing 
through the vehicle, killing Mr Wrightson instantly.

A second British woman, aged 23, suffered 80 per cent burns in the crash.

The horror smash happened on the last hairpin bend 
of a notorious Alpine road – the most famous cycle climb in the world. 
It rises eight miles to a height of 6100 feet and has 21 switchbacks.

The investigating magistrate in 
Grenoble, Jean-Yves Coquillat, said: 'It’s probably a matter of braking.
Now the question is why and the investigation will be long. It will 
take many months.'

The bus was a Classic Coaches 
chartered service operated by UK coach operator TGM. French police will 
interview staff and officials.

They will also interview officials at 
SkiBound, the British tour operator for whom many of the passengers worked
as ski instructors and holiday representatives.

Fresh details of the crash began to emerge yesterday as survivors painted scenes of desperate panic.

Matthew Beauchamp, 19, described 
leaping from the coach as it turned into an inferno and then being 
airlifted to hospital. He needed 20 stitches to his hand and 14 to his 
ankle.

'I'm lucky', he told The Evening 
Standard. 'I could have been injured a lot worse. For everyone to get 
out alive except for the driver is amazing.

Mr Beauchamp, from Downend, Bristol, was returning from six months working in a hotel in the Alps during the ski season.

'The first ten minutes after the crash
were the worst because of not knowing who was accounted for. Everyone 
was looking around in panic to see who got out.'

His father David, 49, said: 'He told 
me that the coach driver was shouting out that the brakes had failed, 
giving them time to brace themselves.

'Matthew said the driver almost stood 
up to make sure that everyone on the coach had heard, and that he 
definitely took the decision to crash into the rock to avoid the coach 
crashing through the barrier on the next hairpin bend.

'Flames immediately took hold on impact, Matthew was lucky that he was near the back.'.

It has been revealed the doomed driver of the coach which crashed in the French Alps tried desperately to warn his 50 passengers there was a problem moments before the horror smash

The relief driver and passengers on 
Wednesday gave statements to police before boarding a 
specially-chartered plane from Grenoble-Isère airport to London Gatwick.

The coach crashed shortly after it departed from the ski resort of Alpe D’Huez on Tuesday afternoon.

Doomed driver Mr Wrightson was praised for his 'remarkable courage' after sacrificing himself to save his 52 passengers.

Survivor: Matthew Beauchamp, 19, injured his hand when he escaped the burning coach

Many of the survivors say he tried to 
steer the vehicle, weighing 12 tonnes and towing a weight of three 
tonnes, to safety after shouting that his brakes had failed.

He managed to stop the bus from 
plunging into a ravine, instead crashing into the side of cliff, killing
himself as the fuel tank at the front of the bus exploded and flames 
tore through the vehicle.

Most of the passengers managed to escape via the right rear door.

Student Fred Brickell, 18, was the 
youngest passenger on the doomed coach, sitting just six seats behind 
the driver at the time of impact.

He managed to scramble to the back as it crashed and escape through the back window.

His father Clive, from Ringmer, East Sussex, said: 'He would want to thank the driver who steered the bus.

'His thoughts would also be with his friends who were injured.'

He said his son's possessions, including shoes and mobile phone, perished as the bus burnt out.

Mr Bricknell and other survivors were flown back to England on a chartered flight to Gatwick.

Frédéric Cuvillier, minister of transport, stressed 'the remarkable courage of the driver'.

He said: 'You can’t call it a miracle 
because there is one dead and many wounded. But the human toll could 
have been much heavier.

'The driver’s courage saved many 
lives. All the testimonies of the people we have met have confirmed 
this. His attitude and his actions prevented an even worse situation.”

The charred remains of the bus were being examined in Vizille.

There were no apparent problems with 
the vehicle until the straight stretch of road before bend 21 – the last
hairpin bend of the mountain road.

The accident happened in the Alpe
d'Huez ski resort - three passengers are understood to be in a serious 
condition, while 17 suffered minor injuries

Mr Wrightson's employers at UK coach operator TGM also praised his actions.

Heath Williams, managing director of TGM, said: 'We are deeply saddened to learn that one of our two drivers on board has died.

'We are offering our full support to 
his family and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time. He 
will be sadly missed by everyone at Classic Coaches.

'A number of passengers have sustained injuries and our thoughts are with them as they recover

'Early indications are that our driver
tried to take evasive action and that he alerted passengers. We pay 
tribute to him for his efforts, and also to our relief driver who helped
people to leave the vehicle.'

He said: 'It is too early to say what 
caused the accident, however, we have launched a full investigation and 
are working closely with the local authorities. Our own safety 
specialist is attending the scene to support the investigation.'

Holiday attraction: Alpe d'Huez is a ski resort particularly popular with Britons

The accident happened at the foot of the notorious, twisting descent from the ski resort of Alpe D’Huez.

The bus had left Dover on Monday with two drivers, one of whom was Mr Wrightson.

They arrived in the ski resort of 
Serre-Chevalier that evening. The following morning 25 passengers, 
employees of British tour operator SkiBound, boarded the coach and 
headed to Alpe D’Huez.

A further 26 passengers boarded the coach and Mr Wrightson, who was now the designated driver, pulled out of Alpe D’Huez at 2pm.

London, Birmingham, Manchester and, finally, Newcastle had been the intended stops.
