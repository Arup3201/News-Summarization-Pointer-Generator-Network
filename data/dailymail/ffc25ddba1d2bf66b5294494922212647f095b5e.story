An antique gun show went ahead as planned on Saturday 40 miles from the site of the December 14 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, even as other gun shows gave in to pressure to cancel after the tragedy.

The two-day East Coast Fine Arms show at a Stamford hotel, the first in Connecticut since a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at the school, drew several hundred people, some of whom were disappointed that more modern weaponry was not available.

'It's neat, it's different but it's not what I expected,' said Sue McCrery of Southington, a town that borders Newtown. 'I mean the bad guys can have them (modern weapons) and I think it's our right to be able to own them too.'

Other gun shows canceled, include one this weekend in Danbury, about 12 miles from Newtown, promoter Big Al's Silver Bullet Productions announced on its website.

Two shows in New York state - February 23-24 in Poughkeepsie and March 2-3 in Suffern - were also canceled, the website said.

In nearby Waterbury, Police Superintendent Michael Gugliotto imposed a moratorium on gun shows the day after the Sandy Hook killings, saying a gun used in a future mass shooting could be traced to a purchase made at a gun show in his city.

Westchester Collectors Inc had planned a firearm and knife show for Waterbury on January 12 and 13. Show organizer Newman Chitenden said canceling the show would not improve security.

Stamford's Republican mayor, Michael Pavia, had asked organizers of the Stamford show to reconsider having the event 'in light of the recent tragic events in Newtown.'

'As a community, we are sensitive to the emotions and feelings of all of those who have suffered losses and are still grieving.

'Holding such an event - at this time, and in such close proximity to the Newtown, seems untimely and insensitive,' Pavia said.

Outside the event, around 50 protesters passed out handbills that called the gun show insensitive and held banners supporting gun control and a ban on assault rifles.

Kara Baekey, who started a local chapter of One Million Moms for Gun Control just three days after the tragedy, told the Stamford Advocate: 'We just felt it was too soon - it was only three weeks ago that the shooting happened and the Newtown community is still grieving and state of Connecticut are still dealing with what happened.'

'The sheer lack of respect for those still grieving was pretty infuriating for us.'

Another protester, Stamford 
resident Robin Wexler, also a member of Moms Against Guns, said: 'After what happened only 40 miles 
from here there has to be changes to laws and stricter gun control in 
order to keep everyone safe.'

But the gun show organizers went ahead, emphasizing that theirs was an antiques event, where the weapons are less deadly and sometimes just for show.

The shooter in Newtown used a military-style semi-automatic assault rifle to kill first-graders aged 6 and 7 and school staff.

'This show is primarily a collectors show, most of us here have strictly antiques,' said Dave Kleiner, an antique weapons dealer from Orrtanna, Pennsylvania.

'Closing the gun show? How is that going to help anyone that was hurt in that episode?'

Gun shows - akin to a fair, where guns are on sale outside the normal confines of a gun shop - have come under scrutiny for so-called loopholes that sometimes allow sales without subjecting purchasers to a background check.

This gun show also caused controversy last week when The Advocate of Stamford newspaper ran an advert for the event next to an article about the Sandy Hook shooting.

The Hearst Connecticut Media Group said the ad's placement was the result of an oversight and apologized on Thursday.

'Our newspapers should not be running gun ads - including ads for antique and collectible gun shows - next to stories about Sandy Hook,' the group said.

'It's insensitive, and it shouldn't have happened. We have taken steps to make sure it doesn't happen again.'
