British helicopter maker AgustaWestland suffered a bruising setback yesterday as India scrapped a major order.

The Indian Ministry of Defence said it had terminated the  £465million deal ‘with immediate effect’ amid allegations the firm bribed officials to win the contract.

The move is a bitter blow for AgustaWestland and its workforce of nearly 3,300 in Yeovil where the helicopters are made.

Scrapped: The Indian Ministry of Defence said it had terminated for the £465million deal the helicopters like this one 'with immediate effect' amid allegations the firm bribed officials to win the contract

However, it comes just days after the company secured a £1billion order from Norway for 16 search and rescue helicopters.

India ordered 12 AW101 choppers in 2010 to transport senior officials such as the prime minister and other high ranking politicians.

Three of the helicopters have been delivered but the other nine will not follow, after the Indian government ended the deal.

Giuseppe Orsi, former head of AgustaWestland’s Italian parent firm, Finmeccanica, is on trial in Italy on fraud and corruption charges for his alleged role in bribery to secure the contract.

AgustaWestland denies that it paid bribes to win the contract.
