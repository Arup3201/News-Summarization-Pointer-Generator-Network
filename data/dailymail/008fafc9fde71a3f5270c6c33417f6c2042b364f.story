Dyson Allen is alleged to have started a fire that three young children and a teenager

A teenager died as he tried in vain to rescue his three younger siblings after a fire was started in a wardrobe, a court has heard.

Reece Smith, 19, battled to get to his sisters, twins Holly and Ella, four, and their two-year-old brother, Jordan, who were asleep at the time of the fire.

But he was overcome by fumes as he went upstairs following the fire which was allegedly started by Dyson Allen, 19, who is on trial for murder.

Allen, who admitted to drinking neat vodka before the fire, was the only other person upstairs at the dormer bungalow in Freckleton, Lancashire, when the fire broke out as a birthday party was being held downstairs for the children's mother, Michelle.

Prosecutor Neil Flewitt told Preston Crown Court: It is the prosecution's case that the defendant, Dyson Allen, was responsible for starting that fire and he did so deliberately.'

Three family friends were also in the house along with the defendant who was a friend of another of Ms Smith's sons. Allen was a regular visitor and stayed overnight the evening before the blaze, the jury was told.

According to people in the house he spent most of the night on January 7 in the second upstairs bedroom, said Mr Flewitt.

He continued: 'Michelle Smith had allowed Dyson Allen to store some of his personal belongings that were in a large blue Ikea bag in bedroom one (the young children's room).

'The presence of that bag may be significant because it would provide a reason for Dyson Allen to go into that bedroom.

'Apart
 from the three young children who were asleep in their beds, he was the
 only person upstairs when the fire started and he was the person that 
alerted the other occupants of the house to what was happening.'

Mother-of-nine
 Ms Smith, 37, said she said remembered the lights going off and then 
the defendant jumped down the stairs and shouted 'Fire' before he ran 
through the kitchen and out of the back door.

Mr Flewitt said: 'Michelle Smith's memory of subsequent events is understandably not clear but she recalls being taken out of the house and sitting on the little wall at the end of the driveway.

'She doesn't remember Reece going up the stairs but she remembers him being brought out and everyone gathering around him.

'Thereafter she was taken in a police car to the hospital where she discovered that four of her children had died in the fire.'

Ms Smith told police that smoke alarms had been fitted at the top and bottom of the stairs but Reece had taken them down in the days before the fire because one or both of them kept making beeping noises.

She said she took the twins up to bed at about 10pm to join Jordan who was already asleep.

The
 prosecutor said: 'She is sure that the doors to the wardrobe were 
closed when she left the room because it annoys her if they are left 
open so she always checks that they are closed and that the children's 
dressing gowns are hanging from the handles.'

Allen, from the Freckleton area, denies four counts of murder and four alternative counts of manslaughter.

The
 court heard the recollection of most of the witnesses who attended the 
party was 'affected to some extent by drink and in some cases by drugs 
in the form of cannabis.'

Mr
 Flewitt said: 'In particular, most of the witnesses are unable to say 
with any certainty at what time various events occurred.'

It could be established though that the first 999 call to report a fire was made at 11.20pm by a neighbour. And that some time after 10.45pm one of the family friends, who was sober, went up to the bedroom where Allen was.

He said the defendant appeared 'drunk and stoned' after Allen had earlier told him was going to make a mix for a cannabis bong. When he returned downstairs there was a loud bang shortly after and all the lights in the house went off.

In a witness statement given to police
 in the early hours of January 8, Allen confirmed he was a friend of 
Reece and one of the victim's younger brothers.

He
 said he began celebrating Ms Smith's birthday at lunchtime by drinking 
from a bottle of vodka. Allen said he was upstairs when the lights 
suddenly went out and he thought it was a power cut.

He saw the children's bedroom door was shut but he could see an 'orange glow' in a gap at the bottom.

'I
 opened the door to check and all of a sudden thick black smoke just hit
 me in the face,' he said. It knocked me backwards. I started shouting 
"fire, fire" straight away.'

He
 said he told Reece there was a fire and to 'get those kids out'. He ran
 downstairs to rouse a person who had fallen asleep on the sofa and then
 ran outside.

The court heard that Reece was heard kicking at the door to the children's bedroom as others escaped from the property.

When police arrived at the bungalow the defendant was outside, and an officer asked him if he was all right.

Allen replied: 'No I'm not. Please, 
I'm worried about my friend Reece. He went back in and upstairs for the 
babies. I tried to follow Reece upstairs to get the babies but the smoke
 was too thick. I've got asthma and I couldn't do it.'

Reece
 Smith was pronounced dead at the scene, while the three other children 
all died at Royal Preston Hospital shortly after midnight, the court 
heard.

Post-mortem examinations concluded all four had died from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by smoke inhalation.

Mr
 Flewitt told the jury that several 'extremely detailed investigations' 
had taken place into the cause of the fire and the unanimous view of the
 experts was that it was started deliberately.

One
 expert concluded the fire started in the hanging clothes in the 
wardrobe, and the most likely source of ignition was a naked flame.

Allen said he saw an 'orange glow' in a gap at the bottom of the door and that he ran down the stairs shouting 'fire, fire'

The fire was detected because of an electrical fault that caused the house electrics to trip out, he continued. And anyone who caused the fire would have seen the ignition and would have had 'ample opportunity' to raise the alarm.

The electrical fault occurred when the fire spread from the wardrobe to a lighting unit fitted to the ceiling of the room, the jury was told.

By that time the fire would have already reached its maximum, said Mr Flewitt.

Forensic evidence showed the three children in the bedroom were likely to have been 'incapacitated very quickly' but that Ella and Jordan made attempts to escape.

Outside Lytham Road, the defendant told a neighbour 'the electrics all cut off' and 'we had to put candles up'.

Another neighbour told police she overheard Allen say: 'It was the candle. The electric went off and we put a candle in the room. I went upstairs and there was a glow and I felt the door and it was so hot I ran downstairs and rang the Fire Brigade.'

Mr Flewitt told the jury: 'You may wish to consider whether what the defendant was saying suggests that he knew rather more about the start of the fire than he later told the police when he made his witness statement.

'Moreover, you will have noticed that what the defendant said does not fit with the sequence of events described by the experts - namely that the electricity went off as a result of, and not before, the fire. So there would have been no opportunity to put a candle in the bedroom because by then the fire would have been burning for between three and five minutes.'

On January 10 the defendant went to a church memorial service in Lytham for the Smith family.

He later called at the Station pub in the town with several others, said the prosecutor, where he was said to have told a friend: 'I don't know what to do. I've screwed up. I'm leaving tomorrow and going to Liverpool.'

Allen was arrested the next day and then bailed pending further inquiries.

Police re-arrested him in December 2012 and found two 'interesting' Skype conversations recovered from his laptop, said the prosecutor.

In one of the chats he told a female Skype user: 'btw (by the way) this is what I did xxxxxx. Well menna have done xxxxx.'

He then sent her a website link to a newspaper article which detailed his arrest on suspicion of murder. Allen went on to maintain his innocence before police charged him with the four murders.

The trial, which is scheduled to last up to eight weeks, continues tomorrow.
