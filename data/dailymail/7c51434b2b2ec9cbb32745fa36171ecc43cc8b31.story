It is a headache familiar to many parents  - the foul smelling lotions, the painstaking grooming of figdety heads, while fending off little hands desperate for a scratch.

But head lice don't just affect children, as 36-year-old Liz Slimon found out.

The mother-of-two caught the itchy critters from her young son Dylan. She spent hundreds of pounds on treatments, potions 
and even new bed sheets and towels as she tried to get rid of the 
infestation, but to no avail.

After six months of having a headful of nits Ms Slimon, of Eastbourne was so desperate to get rid of them she even considered pouring bleach on to her head.

Ms Slimon's ordeal began when five-year-old Dylan started school last year.

Head lice are tiny wingless insects that live in human hair. They are common, particularly in children.

They are grey-brown in colour, the size of a pinhead when hatched and of a sesame seed when fully grown. 

They cannot fly, jump or swim and are spread by head-to-head contact, climbing from the hair of an infected person to the hair of someone else.

A head lice infestation is not the result of dirty hair or poor hygiene. Head lice can affect all types of hair irrespective of its condition and length.

Head lice only affect humans and cannot be passed on to animals or be caught from them.

She said: 'He was really excited when we enrolled him in September. 

'But the following January, we noticed Dylan had brought home a few of his less welcome friends, head lice.

'By the time I’d found a few on his head, it was too late. They’d managed to spread from Dylan to my daughter Elsie, my partner and even my own head was itchy with lice.

'My first thought was embarrassment and disgust. I had never had head lice as a child, so to find that the entire family had caught them left me reeling.

'My partner had heard that the best thing to do was to shave off all the hair, so standing in front of the mirror, he methodically shaved off all of his hair.

'Our son saw him doing it and wanted his hair done as well.

'Dylan looked terrible but my partner and I thought it would be the best action to take against the head lice.'

But unfortunately for Ms Slimon, who also has daughter Elsie, one, there was no remedy that worked for her.

Head lice can usually be effectively treated using medicated lotions or by wet combing, using a specially designed head lice comb

She said: 'I went through almost every lotion and potion, asking the pharmacist what the strongest pesticide treatments were, I was that desperate to be rid of them. 

'I tried almost everything and for six months, we went back and forth to the pharmacist for a new treatment. I wasn’t able to have my hair cut at the hair dressers for the entire six months, because I knew they’d find the lice in my head and turn me away, it would have been so embarrassing. 

'I was close to pouring a bottle of bleach on my head in a last ditch attempt, the months on end of disgust, constant itching and embarrassment had taken their toll and I was completely fed up.'

Head lice can usually be effectively treated using medicated lotions or by wet combing, using a specially designed head lice comb. 

Wet combing can be used without medicated lotions, but needs to be done regularly and can take a long time to do thoroughly. 

However, no medicated treatment is 100 per cent effective.

Ms Slimon finally found relief with a medicated lotion called Hedrin, and said she was disgusted - and relieved  - when she washed her families hair and watched the dead lice drop out in their hundreds.

Luckily Ms Slimon has remained lice free since the summer, but she says she is well-prepared should they make a come back.

She said: 'I have a bottle in my bathroom cupboard to catch any quickly if we do have the unwelcome guests come back. It will save the family shaving their heads again and I can finally have a haircut!'
