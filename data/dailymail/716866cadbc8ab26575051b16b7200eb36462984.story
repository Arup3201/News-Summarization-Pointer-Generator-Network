Couple: Lynsey McConnell, 24, of Kirkcaldy, is set to marry her 36-year-old fiancé Ally Grubb next year

A 24-year-old woman today revealed the ordeal of losing her unborn baby after she was mugged for a cigarettes packet by two female attackers.

Lynsey McConnell was nine weeks pregnant when she was attacked by two women who beat her so savagely she suffered a miscarriage.

She was confronted in Kirkcaldy, Fife, by Cheryl Henderson, 27, and 29-year-old Kelly Vanbeck, who demanded she hand over cigarettes. But the pair kicked her in the stomach after she said she did not smoke and tried to flee.

A passing cyclist helped Miss McConnell escape but she was left devastated when doctors told her she had lost her baby in the assault.

Now Miss McConnell - who is set to marry her fiancé Ally Grubb, 36, next year - is hoping that fertility treatment will help her have a baby.

She said: ‘I was diagnosed at 15 with polycystic ovary syndrome and had been told it would be difficult to fall pregnant without help.

‘But in July 2012 I went to my GP thinking I had a sickness bug. The doctor asked me to do a pregnancy test as standard and I was gobsmacked when it came back positive.

‘So I was ecstatic when I found out and when I told Ally he was over the moon as well. Days later I went to visit a friend who had badly sprained her ankle and tell her my news.

‘I went to the garage to get her cigarettes but when I came out I was approached by two women who asked if I had any cigarettes and I said I didn’t smoke.

'But when she saw them in my pocket, one grabbed me and dragged me into an alley.

‘They went through my bag and demanded I hand over my bank card. When I said I didn’t know the pin I was kicked me in the face and as I fell to the ground they started kicking me.

‘I pleaded - saying I was pregnant, hoping they would leave me alone and begged them not to hurt my baby. But as soon as I said that, they started kicking me in the stomach and the pain just erupted.

‘I kept saying “my baby”, but they continued to kick me. They robbed me of my great aunt’s necklace and my engagement ring.  I thought since they had what they wanted and that it would be over.

‘But then one of them ground her knee into my stomach and I felt a sudden damp patch on my leggings. Everything was a blur but I knew it was blood. I knew in that moment, I was losing my baby.’

Miss McConnell was taken to Kirkcaldy’s Victoria Hospital she was told the baby had been lost.

She added: ‘My world just crashed down around me when I heard the words “no heartbeat”.

‘I was treated for broken ribs, a chipped eye socket and a dislocated ankle. They had dislocated my finger trying to snatch my engagement ring off it.

‘But I didn’t feel the pain - only numbness as I grieved for the baby I never thought I’d have, who was now gone. We had to postpone our wedding as we mourned our baby.

‘I gave a statement to police and within a few days the girls were caught. I still suffer flashbacks and have terrible nightmares.’

Henderson and Vanbeck pled guilty to assault and robbery at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court in October 2012. Henderson was jailed for 33 months and Vanbeck for 27 months.

Miss McConnell and Mr Grubb are now planning their wedding for summer 2015 and undergoing fertility tests and treatment at Victoria Hospital.

She added: ‘Now we are just having tests done to hopefully decided what avenues can be explored. After everything, it has given us hope.’

Mr Grubb, who gave up his call-centre work to become Lynsey’s full-time carer, said: ‘It was a terrible time and losing the baby was very traumatic.’
