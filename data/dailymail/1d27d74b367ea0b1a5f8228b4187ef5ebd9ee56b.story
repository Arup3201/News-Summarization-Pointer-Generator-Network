Adrian Peterson today arrived at a New York hearing to fight back against his indefinite suspension from the National Football League for whipping his four-year-old son with a wooden switch.

The Minnesota Vikings running back, who pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault last month, was suspended for the rest of the season for violating the league's personal conduct policy.

But donning a dark blue suit and white shirt, he arrived at the Manhattan appeal at 9am in a bid to get the suspension overturned. He ducked away from photographers as he entered the building.

The NFL, whose Commissioner Roger Goodell has formerly told Peterson he will not be considered for reinstatement before April 15, has provided no time frame for a ruling once the appeal ends.

However, Peterson may have his hopes up following the league's highly-controversial recent decision to overturn its indefinite suspension against Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice.

Rice, who was suspended after being filmed knocking out his wife, Janay, in an Atlantic City elevator, won his appeal last Friday, meaning he is now eligible to sign with any NFL team immediately.

Peterson, who has not played for the Vikings since week one of this season while dealing with the child abuse allegations in Texas, was placed on paid leave while the legal process played out.

The 29-year-old disciplined his son using a thin branch last May, leaving severe cuts, welts and bruises on his body. Photos of the boy's injuries were later released by Houston Police Department.

On November 4, Peterson avoided jail but received probation, a $4,000 fine and a requirement to perform 80 hours of community service for the 'discipline'.

But Goodell, who imposed the season-long suspension on November 18, told the player in an open letter: 'You have shown no meaningful remorse for your conduct.

'When indicted, you acknowledged what you did but said that you would not "eliminate whooping my kids" and defended your conduct in numerous published text messages to the child's mother.

'You also said that you felt "very confident with my actions because I know my intent".

'These comments raise the serious concern that you do not fully appreciate the seriousness of your conduct, or even worse, that you may feel free to engage in similar conduct in the future.'

Peterson, who said he was similarly disciplined as a child, was backed by the NFL Players Association, which called the punishment 'unprecedented, arbitrary, and unlawful.'

The union has argued that the player should get credit for time served on the exempt list.

Although Rice was reinstated by the NFL last week, Peterson's case is very different.

The former had already served an initial two-game suspension when he was suspended indefinitely by the league. This led an arbitrator to argue that he was a victim of double jeopardy.

Meanwhile, Peterson's indefinite suspension is the first and only punishment he has received. 

In addition, while Rice faced a former federal judge with no NFL affiliation, Peterson is making his case to Judge Harold Henderson, a longtime counsel to the league, ABC reported.

Previous appearance: Peterson, pictured laughing beside his wife, Ashley, in October, avoided jail but received probation, a $4,000 fine and  80 hours of community service for the 'discipline' of his son in May this year

Rice - who sparked outrage when he was pictured partying just hours after winning his appeal - and Peterson are not the only footballer stars in the limelight for alleged assaults.

Florida State University quarterback Jameis Winston's  code of conduct hearing is also scheduled to start today following claims he sexually assaulted a female student.

Winston has maintained his innocence and was cleared of criminal charges earlier this year.
