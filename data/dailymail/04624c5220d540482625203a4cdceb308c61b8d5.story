A police chief has come under fire for threatening a man who accused the department of spending too much time worrying about minor drug offenders in a Facebook post.

Reuben Santiago, interim police chief in Columbia, South Carolina, told resident Brandon Whitmer that his complaint - that local police were too concerned with 'stoners' and should focus on more serious crime because '(marijuana) will be legal here one day anyway' - left the officer with 'reasonable suspicion' he might be a 'criminal' too.

'Thank you for sharing your views and giving us reasonable suspicion to believe you might be a criminal,' the post said.

'We will work on finding you.'

The post, published from the official Columbia Police Department (CPD) Facebook account, was quick to cause chaos on the page and be deleted.

But followers began attacking the department for making unnecessary threats.

Trouble: Reuben Santiago, interim police chief in Columbia, South Carolina told, threatened to hunt a Facebook user down after the man questioned police priorities

Now deleted: This is the post that started the Facebook fiasco. Followers were quick to call the police response an unnecessary threat

But despite the drama, Chief Santiago went back online to announce that the original police post had indeed been written by him.

'This is Interim Chief Santiago posting, I was just notified that one of my staff members deleted my post,' he wrote.

'I put everyone on notice that if you advocate for the use of illegal substances in the City of Columbia then it's reasonable to believe you MIGHT also be involved in that particular activity.

'Threat? Why would someone feel threaten (sic) if you are not doing anything wrong? Apply this same concept to gang activity or gang members.

'You can have have gang tattoos and advocate that life style, but that only makes me suspicious of them, I can't do anything until they commit a crime.

'So feel free to express yourself, and I will continue to express myself and what we stand for.

'I am always open to hearing how our citizens feel like we can be effective in fighting all crime.'

While attempting to quell the uproar, Santiago only fueled it.

'I'm smoking weed as we speak!' one person posted.

'Come find me...Disregard the murderers and rapists, us pot smokers are the real threat.'

Making a major backtrack, Santiago told The State newspaper he had posted his reply late at night while watching television.

He later sent an apology to the first man and said he has since learned a lesson in what not to say on Facebook.

Interesting twist: After the original post had been deleted, Columbia Police Chief Reuben Santiago went back on Facebook and posted this message, which seemed to only make matters worse

In a statement released to media, the CPD's public information officer admitted the Chief had written the comments himself, but said they had been misunderstood.

'Chief was trying to say that he puts would-be-criminals on notice,' he said.

'If you commit a crime or plan to commit one, CPD will work hard to investigate and press charges according to the law.

'It's easy for social media posts to be misunderstood.'

Whitmer's complaint was made in response to a post published by the CPD promoting their recent seizure of '$40,000 of marijuana' and arrest of its owner.

Whitmer commented that police time would be better spent tracking down 'the people shooting people in [local district] Five Points instead of worrying about a stoner that's not bothering anyone'.
