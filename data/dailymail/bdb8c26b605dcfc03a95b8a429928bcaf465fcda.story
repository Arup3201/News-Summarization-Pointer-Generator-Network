The president of a group planning to build a fortress city in Western Idaho, in which all citizens aged 13 and up will be armed with rifles, has posted pictures of the group's gun factory online.

James Miller says the moment has come for his movement which is ‘ready to stand on the green and defend liberty' inspired by Captain John Parker, who commanded the Lexington militia.

News of the scheme dubbed ‘the Citadel’ emerged yesterday with its website claiming hundreds of families had already signed up to the ‘patriotic’ community.

Home-made: Weapons made by the III Arms Company will be sold to fund the Citadel according to its website. Pictures of the process have been put on Facebook

Gun-maker: James Miller, President of the III Arms Company, says the time was right for a citadel, right. The project claims to own 200 acres in Western Idaho from which they hope to develop their fortress city, left

The group say they plan to create a town of 3,500 to 7,000 families supported with an arms factory run by the III Arms Company at the Citadel’s core providing income for the society through sales and also arming residents aged 13 and over to become the city’s ‘security force’. '

‘Those who consider us insane [do so] only because they don’t hear what the III Arms calling is doing and the Citadel has for us,’ Miller the president of the III Arms Company told a meeting to promote the movement. ‘It is up to us to make them hear that call to bring them aboard and make them one of us.’

III Arms Company's Facebook site contains numerous photographs of the group's cache of home-made guns including assault weapons, which they are selling for more than $1000 a go, and calls to oppose gun control in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre.

Miller, who is president of The III Arms Company and a key supporter of the Citadel, was filmed speaking at a 'Patcon' meeting last year when plans were first coming together for the armed city.

The Citadel has so far purchased 20 acres of land in Benewah County, Idaho, which its website says will ‘become the initial factory location for our firearms company and will be developed into a Showcase for the larger Citadel concept.’ They say the mountainous area is their first choice for the completed project.

Plans for the final city show a perimeter wall to the community complete with 18 look-out towers, a firearms museum, a reflecting pool, a school and an amphitheatre.

III Arms Company is currently selling homemade AR-15s and 1911 pistols although point out legislation on gun control following the Sandy Hook massacre may block the sale of assault rifles in the future.

‘Face it folks. The market changed overnight Tuesday,’ the website reads. ‘The ability to purchase an AR at yesterday's costs is rapidly coming to a quick and painful ending. The timer started ticking Tuesday. It's a countdown timer and we're rapidly approaching 00:00:00. In the firearms world, when that timer hits 00:00:00 this time...it does not reset like it did in 2004.’

The group say the community will live in accordance with Thomas Jefferson's ideal of rightful liberty and prepare for all imagined emergencies.

‘It will be defined by physical preparedness to survive and prevail in the face of natural catastrophes --such as Hurricanes Sandy or Katrina -- or man-made catastrophes such as a power grid failure or economic collapse,’ the website says.

Miller adds: ‘I think we are all ready for something like this to succeed and honestly the moment for making something like this to happen is right now.’

Site: The proposed location for the Citadel is in Benwah County, Idaho where the group have already purchased 20 acres

Many have put themselves forward as possible Citadel residents on the website and The III Arms Company’s Facebook account.

Jason Hamrick III wrote: ‘I wish the wife could relocate. I would be there in a heart beat.’

Another commentator known only as 
Matt added: ‘I wish you guys luck. I think it's a great idea and there 
should be many more like it.’

Others have criticized it and argued it will never be able to go ahead.

‘Can we build another wall, taller, around it?’ One comment said.
