Danny Welbeck is confident the goals will flow for both Arsenal and England if he is given a run of games as an out-and-out attacker.

The 23-year-old begins a new chapter this week after swapping home-town club Manchester United for the Gunners in a £16million deadline day move.

Welbeck had been with the Old Trafford giants since the age of eight, but dropped down the pecking order and grew increasingly frustrated at a lack of opportunities to lead the line.

Danny Welbeck said he is confident goals will flow for club and country if he gets a run as a central striker

It was a position he shone in for England on Monday evening, netting a second-half brace in Switzerland to secure a winning start to their European Championship qualifying campaign.

And Welbeck is confident goals will continue to rack up if he is allowed to play in his favoured role.

He said: 'It is well known I prefer to play through the middle so when I get my opportunity I just want to show what I can do.

'Once I get into the box and get the opportunities I have got faith in my ability.

'Before I wasn't getting into the box because I wasn't playing too much as a striker and I had to worry about my defensive work.

'Listen, anyone can say what they want to say but I just know once I get the opportunity and a run of games up front I will do my best.

'That's definitely what I need. It is good for any footballer to get a run of games.

'You become more confident and play much more at ease and to get a run of games would be absolutely perfect.

'That is my first 90 minutes this season so it is just the start of things and really looking forward to it.'

Welbeck says he has not had a decent run of games since Christmas last year, suggesting Monday's display in Basle could be just a taster of what is in store for Arsenal and England.

The forward impressed up top alongside captain Wayne Rooney, with his goals helping the Three Lions to a much-needed 2-0 win after the World Cup debacle.

'It was important,' Welbeck said. 'It was good for me to get the two goals but it was more important for the whole team to get the win and off to a flying start and to get three points from scratch and that was the most pleasing thing.

'I think what we have worked this week in training a lot of it showed and that is very pleasing because it showed your hard work is not going to waste and that is what we have got - players in midfield who can break on beyond the attackers and we know if they get behind us we are going to sit in for them.

'We are fighting for each other as a team and that is most important.'
