The teen accused of shooting a toddler between the eyes during a robbery attempt counted down from five before firing, his alleged accomplice testified today after pointing him out as the shooter.

Dominique Lang testified that he ran into De'Marquise Elkins on the morning of the March 21 slaying. A short while later as the two walked together, they saw Sherry West with a stroller.

Lang says Elkins walked to West and demanded her purse before pulling out a gun. When West refused to hand the purse over, he hit her in the face with it and threatened her baby.

'The baby was in the stroller screaming,' Lang said.

Alleged accomplice: Dominique Lang points out defendant De'Marquise Elkins during testimony on Thursday, August 22, as the shooter of a 13-month-old baby

In court: De'Marquise Elkins is charged with murder, child cruelty, attempted armed robbery and multiple counts of aggravated assault in connection to the March 21 shooting

Murdered: Baby Antonio was shot in the head as he slept by two boys who attempted to rob his mother

Elkins shot Sherry West in the leg with his .22 caliber handgun, he testified, and then shot the 13-month-old baby Antonio Santiago.

De'Marquise Elkins is charged with murder, child cruelty, attempted armed robbery and multiple counts of aggravated assault in connection to the March 21 shooting.

If convicted, Elkins will not face the death penalty because he was 17 at the time of the killing, too young under Georgia law to be executed.

Prosecutors have also accused Elkins of shooting Wilfredo Calix Flores outside a local church ten days before the child was killed.

The killing this spring in the port of city of Brunswick, close to vacation spots like Jekyll Island, drew national attention, and the trial was moved to the Atlanta suburbs because of the extensive publicity the case received locally.

In opening statements, Johnson told jurors that both shootings started off as robberies.

'When it didn't happen immediately, as Mr Elkins thought it should, his reaction was to shoot,' Johnson alleged.

'The young man took the gun and aimed it 
at Antonio's head and shot him right between the eyes,' Brunswick 
District Attorney Jackie Johnson told jurors.

Sworn in: Lang says Elkins walked to West and 
demanded her purse before pulling out a gun. When West refused to hand 
the purse over, he hit her in the face with it and threatened her baby

The prosecutor said Elkins and Lang stopped the mother and child as they returned home from the post office.

Johnson said that Elkins pointed a small .22-caliber revolver at West and demanded her money. West did not immediately hand over her purse and the child was shot.

Bystanders and rescue workers were unable to revive the child, who was pronounced dead at the scene.

Lang is also charged as an adult with murder but will be tried separately. Authorities said Lang identified Elkins as the shooter.

Defense attorney Jonathan Lockwood suggested that Antonio's parents were somehow involved in his death, though he did not provide a precise motive or further explain that theory.

He said that no one in the neighborhood saw or heard anyone fleeing the scene of the shooting.

He also questioned whether police focused their investigation too soon on the wrong suspects. He said that West tried to collect on a life insurance policy shortly after her son's death.

'The police were under a great deal of pressure to see that the matter was resolved as vacation season was not far away,' Lockwood said.

Lockwood said the child's parents both
 had gunshot residue on their hands. A report filed earlier by the 
Georgia Bureau of Investigation said that gunshot residue can wind up on
 shooting victims.

The child's father, Louis Santiago, said during an 
initial court hearing that he touched the bullet wound on West's leg 
before his hands were swabbed.

Prosecutors
 said information from Elkins' mother and sister led investigators to a 
pond where they found a .22-caliber revolver.

Elkins'
 mother, Karimah Elkins, is standing trial alongside her son on charges 
of evidence tampering and lying to police. Elkins' sister was also 
charged with evidence tampering.

An
 attorney for Karimah Elkins, J. Wrix McIlvaine, said police had 
violated her rights and that she was not involved in the killing.

McIlvaine said, 'None of these people had anything to do with the shooting of a child.'

Conspiracy: The defense has suggested that the baby's parents killed him to collect his life insurance

Incriminating: West's 21-year-old daughter told a TV 
station that her mother called her after Antonio's murder wondering how 
long it would take to receive a check from the life insurance company

Spared: Because of his youth, Elkins will not be facing capital punishment, if convicted

Elkins was last a student in the 
system in October 2011 when he left Ombudsman, an outsourced alternative
 school program, Weidhaas said.

Both
 prosecutors and Elkins' defense attorneys declined to comment before 
the trial, citing a gag order by the judge. The boy's mother also 
declined to talk.

In 2008, West's 18-year-old son was 
stabbed to death in an altercation in New Jersey. Prosecutors said the 
stabbing was self-defense and did not file charges.

History of violence: Prosecutors said Elkins shot somebody else 10 days before the toddler was killed

Family: Elkins' mother and sister provided information that led police to a pond where they found a .22 caliber revolver

Defense
 attorneys also pointed to lab tests by the Georgia Bureau of 
Investigation that found traces of gunshot residue on swabs taken from 
the hands of West and the boy's father, Louis Santiago.

Reports
 filed in court stated the GBI found a single microscopic particle of 
gunshot residue swabbed from the father's hands, while more than five 
particles showed up in swabs from West's hands.

The
 GBI report cautioned that gunshot victims can end up with residue on 
them. During a preliminary court hearing, Santiago said he touched the 
bullet wound on West's leg before his hands were swabbed.

In
 a court filing on Wednesday, District Attorney Jackie Johnson argued that 
Elkins' defense lawyers have made ‘false, inflammatory and misleading 
statements’ about the case.

While
 the toddler's mother identified Elkins as the shooter in a photo 
lineup, police said much of their evidence against the teenager came 
from his own family and the younger teen charged as his accomplice. 

Grief: Antonio's father Luis Santiago tries to comfort Ms West at her apartment on Friday

Horror: Demarquis Elkins, 17, allegedly threatened Sherry West then shot her infant son when she didn't give him any money

Investigators
 have testified that Lang told police he and Elkins were trying to rob a
 woman pushing a baby in a stroller when Elkins pulled a gun and shot 
them both.

Lang's aunt,
 Debra Obey, told police her nephew and Elkins came to her for a ride 
the day of the slaying. She said Elkins ducked down in the back seat of 
her car, as if he was hiding.

Four
 days after the shooting, police said information from Elkins' mother 
and sister helped lead investigators to a pond where they found a 
.22-caliber revolver.

Both
 women were charged with evidence tampering. Elkins' mother, Karimah 
Elkins, also was charged with lying to police.

Prosecutors say Elkins' 
mother and an aunt gave police conflicting alibis for his whereabouts at
 the time of the shooting. Karimah Elkins is scheduled to stand trial 
alongside her son.
