Emmanuel Adebayor will not be rushed back for Tottenham Hotspur's Capital One Cup quarter-final tie with Newcastle United on Wednesday night.

Adebayor has returned to training after a week's compassionate leave in Africa.

The Togo striker was allowed to return home after he was embroiled in a family row.

In November, Adebayor's older brother Kola claimed the player had been brainwashed by Islamic spiritual healers into thinking their mother used black magic to sabotage his form on the pitch.

But even though he reported back on schedule on Monday morning, manager Mauricio Pochettino says that the best part of 72 hours will still not be enough to throw him straight back in.

Adebayor has not played since November 7 due to an injury picked up on international duty which later ran into a virus.

Despite the player now being fit, manager Pochettino said on Tuesday: 'He was back yesterday, but play tomorrow? No.

'He began training after one week yesterday so it would be impossible for him to be ready tomorrow.'

Although the Premier League remains a priority, Pochettino would love to deliver the trophy the long-suffering Tottenham fans crave.

The north Londoners are just two games away from Wembley and Pochettino said: 'It's important for the club and important for us and our supporters.

'It's a big game and a very good opportunity to go to a semi-final. We need to create a good platform. Newcastle are a very good team. We need to create a nice and great atmosphere to go to the semi-final.'
