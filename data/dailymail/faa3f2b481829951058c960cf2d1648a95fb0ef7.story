They might look like props from a sci-fi film, but this strange collection of objects is actually a hands-on training kit for midwives working in developing countries.

A Norwegian company came up with a trio of affordable products aimed at helping to save lives in countries where preventable birth-related deaths is greatest as many midwives do not access to  education or training.

'The Natalie Collection' comprises a birthing simulator, suction device and newborn simulator to provide practical training in a bid to help reduce the number of newborn babies and mothers that die just after giving birth - two of the UN's Millennium Development Goals.

The other-worldly-looking 'Mama Natalie Birthing Simulator' is a wearable contraption that that is meant to simulate a woman's womb, but in a slightly abstract and inoffensive way. The simple design only focuses on the most important features without realistic aesthetic distractions

The concept, which combines industrial design and education, was dreamed up by Laerdal Global Health in response to the shocking statistic that 3,000 newborn babies die from birth asphyxia along with 1,000 birthing mothers every day.

The company claims that The Natalie Collection is a portable and low-cost way of training skilled professionals.

This scene might look gory, but it is a simulation of a birth using the unusual training aid. Fake blood is used to make the scenario more realistic

The simple design only focuses on the most important features without realistic aesthetic distractions but there is still something bizarre about this scene from a role play where a midwife is pulling on a fake umbilical cord

The simple design only focuses on the most important features without realistic aesthetic distractions.

However, it can be used with fake blood to prepare and train midwives for post birth bleeding, which is a leading cause of maternal deaths.

Less strangely, a penguin-shaped suction device called the NeoNatalie Suction, is designed to train midwives to access babies' nostrils effectively but safely to help newborns with breathing difficulties.

The company claims that The Natalie Collection, including the birth simulator (pictured) is a portable and low-cost way of training skilled professionals and the fake blood makes the training more realistic

The device is easily disinfected and transparent so that professionals can inspect the suctioned material.

The 'NeoNatalie Newborn Simulator' a mannequin designed to focus a user's attention on the important aspects of a baby’s body to provide realism only where it is important.

Details such as weight, head articulation, umbilical pulse, as well as the babies’ breath and heartbeat have been simulated as closely as possible, making the model similar to handling a real baby.

The devices, which combines industrial design and education, were dreamed up by Laerdal Global Health in response to the shocking statistic that 3,000 newborn babies die from birth asphyxia along with 1,000 birthing mothers every day

A training programme with charity Helping Babies Breathe, which uses the NeoNatalie collection in Tanzania has shown a 47 per cent 
reduction in newborn death due to asphyxia.

Katinka Von Der Lippe who is involved in the project, said: 'The Natalie Collection
is a low-cost, practical, hands-on training kit for the most important 
and critical moment in life - when a baby is being born.'

She said it is a good example of how clever design can improve living conditions and its simple approach invites participation and teamwork.

The company claims the product encourages the learning process to become playful enabling midwives and birth assistants to role-play.

'Since the Natalie Collection is based on practical involvement, language barriers have little impact on the learning process,' she added.
