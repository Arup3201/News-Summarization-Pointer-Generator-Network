To her listeners, she sounds utterly composed as she asks guests to tell her their Desert Island Discs.

But when host Kirsty Young found herself face to face with Tom Jones, she became a little… flustered.

The host of Radio 4’s long-running interview programme has revealed she was overcome by the singer’s ‘animal magnetism’ – and imagined that he must be a ‘killer in the sack’.

Lanarkshire-born Miss Young said the singer ‘pulsates sexuality’ and hinted that she might have been unable to keep her hands off him in his younger days.

Sir Tom, 74, appeared on Desert Island Discs in 2010. Miss Young, 45, revealed he was one of her ‘favourite customers’ in ten years of fronting the programme, and said she would take Sir Tom’s music to a desert island.

She told the Radio Festival in Salford: ‘I was grateful that I was interviewing him in the autumn of his years, because God knows if he had walked into my studio 30 years ago I would not have been responsible for my actions.

‘He pulsates sexuality. It is unfair. He has an animal magnetism and he is very at home with himself. I can only imagine he is a killer in the sack.’

Miss Young, 45, took over Desert Island Discs – which first aired in 1942 – from Sue Lawley in 2004. In each episode, she plays music chosen by her guests while interviewing them about their lives.

At the end, they must choose which single track they would take to a desert island, along with a book and a luxury item. 

Thoughts: Miss Young also revealed she felt Ed Miliband’s Desert Island Disc was a 'compromised' choice. The Labour leader (above) was ridiculed  after he named Angels by Robbie Williams as his favourite piece of music

Sir Tom chose Jerry Lee Lewis’ single A Whole Lotta Shakin’ Going On as the track he would save as a castaway, and a bucket and spade as his luxury item.

During the interview, he admitted he had ‘over-indulged’ in his sex life, and had been ‘weak-minded’ over temptation during his marriage.

Asked about his sexual image, he told Miss Young: ‘I did feel like that. Sex Bomb, you can’t get away from that title. 

'When you do things, sometimes you create a monster without actually realising. Sometimes I should rein myself in a little bit.’

Miss Young, who is married to businessman Nick Jones, with whom she has two daughters and two stepchildren, said one of the celebrities she most wanted to interview was US comedian Joan Rivers, who died last month.

She also revealed that she felt Ed Miliband’s Desert Island Disc was a ‘compromised’ choice because it was not really his favourite track.

The Labour leader was ridiculed last year after he named the song Angels by Robbie Williams as his favourite piece of music on the Radio 4 show.

Miss Young added her voice to the sceptics who felt it may have been chosen by his spin doctors in an attempt to appeal to voters.

She told the Radio Festival: ‘Isn’t it a coincidence that it was the best selling track in the country? My overall impression was his list probably was compromised in places, but fair enough.’

The Scottish presenter said she remembers Mr Miliband failed to meet her eye during their interview, making it harder for her to tell if his choices were genuine.
