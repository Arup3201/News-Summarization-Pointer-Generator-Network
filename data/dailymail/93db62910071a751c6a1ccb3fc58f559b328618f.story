Baby product company Graco has come under fire after one of its double strollers was seemed unsafe because it failed a brakes test.

According to the latest issue of Consumer Reports, the Ready2Grow Classic Connect LX, which costs $210, raised safety concerns during a routine test after its brakes released when it was angled 19 degrees up on a tilt table.

'If you must use one of those strollers, be aware of the potential brake issue,' warns the magazine, which labeled the stroller a 'Don't Buy' product.

Consumer Reports also found that after the stroller underwent the test, the plastic teeth that lock the wheel sin place were bent and showed stress marks.

The company responded that there have been no brake-related injuries reported for this particular model, and Consumer Reports confirmed this claim.

Graco added that the brakes are being upgraded 'as part of continuous improvement,' and that the new system will meet the safety standard as tested by the magazine.

The stroller, which is able to carry two children simultaneously, is one of the most popular purchases on the Graco website, with customers giving it an average rating of 4.2 out of five stars.

But Consumer Reports further explained its negative review in a video on its website.

'We've tested more than 160 strollers, and this is the only one where the brake gave way'

'We've tested more than 160 strollers, single and double that are listed in our ratings,' says John Galeotafiore, head of stroller testing for Consumer Reports, in the video. 'And this is the only one where the brake gave way.'

The publication even went so far as to 
recommend that parents who have already purchased one of the models in 
question should ask the retailer for a refund.

Models Ready 2 Grow Classix Connect LX, the Classic Connect, Click Connect LX and Click Connect were all included in the 'Don't Buy' rating.

A spokesperson for Graco has refuted the unfavorable write-up, calling Consumer Reports' test measures 'unreasonably excessive'.

'Our test is designed to assess whether strollers have an extra margin of safety'

'While we share a common commitment to the safety of families that use our products, we strongly disagree with Consumer Reports' assertion that our Ready2Grow Classic Connect stroller is unsafe,' the spokesperson told CNNMoney.

But Mr Galeotafiore explains: 'Our test is rigorous. But it's designed to assess whether strollers have an extra margin of safety.'
