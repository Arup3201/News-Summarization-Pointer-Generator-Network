A Brooklyn drug dealer with ties to a well-known hip hop artist accused of running a murderous drug gang has admitted to cross dressing in order to more easily kill a rival.

Saquan Wallace, 28, told a federal jury hearing the racketeering trial for Ronald ‘Ra Diggs’ Herron that the rapper advised him to don a wig, lipstick and makeup to track and then kill the target.

‘I put on a wig, lipstick, makeup and I went looking for him,’ Wallace testified Thursday in court, according to the New York Daily News.

The six-foot-two Wallace weighs upwards of 200 pounds, but said he looked passable in a shirt long enough to be a dress while skulking in the hallways of the Wyckoff Gardens housing projects looking for Jabari Foster in early 2006.

Herron, 32, wanted Foster, a one-time protégé, dead because he continued to sell drugs in Wyckoff Gardens in open defiance of the hip hop artist.

The rapper’s violent gang ran the drug trade, mainly crack cocaine, in the nearby Gowanus Houses, authorities contend.  They ran him into court on a racketeering count and three murder charges.

The idea to dress like a woman came from Herron, who Wallace said gave him the idea after doing it himself.

Wallace claimed he lurked in the grim project’s halls until finding an apartment with a loud music.He then waited in the hopes Foster would emerge from the party.

‘Someone walked out and I was around the wall waiting,’ the man already serving 30 years on murder, racketeering and drug charges testified. 

‘When the person came in the open it was him [Foster] and I opened fire on him repeatedly and killed him.’

He then replied ‘yes’ when asked during cross-examination if he looked like a woman.

‘So it was a good disguise for you?’ Defense Lawyer James Neuman asked.

‘It was good enough,’ the admitted killer said, adding that he burned the getup after the killing.

Wallace admitted he is looking to cut a deal with officials for a shorter sentence in exchange for his testimony.

His identical twin brother was also locked up for 20 years on drug charges.

Authorities are using Herron’s performances and songs as Ra Digg, which portray a gang banging, drug dealing and murderous lifestyle, against him in court.

None of the murders he is accused of involve cross dressing.
