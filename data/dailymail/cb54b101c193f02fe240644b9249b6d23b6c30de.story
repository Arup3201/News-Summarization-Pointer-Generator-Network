Three young children have been left without their mother after she was dragged by the driver of an SUV and run over in the street where the family lives.

Kristina Purdin Dunn, 28, died in hospital on Monday after a horrific incident which was watched by her eight-year-old daughter Morgan. Mrs Dunn also leaves two sons - Jonathan, ten, and five-year-old Brandon.

Her devastated husband Mike Dunn, 30, said the driver sped off after an argument about a $130 bill outside their home in Middletown, Ohio.

Mr Dunn was with his wife beside the truck and was arguing with driver Dustin Watkins who wanted  money for a paint job he had not finished, according to WLWT.

As female passenger Maria Misquez screamed at Watkins to leave, Mrs Dunn's arm became entangled in a seatbelt, causing her to be pulled along beside the SUV before being run over.

Police were called to the street at 9pm on Sunday where they found the mother lying on the ground bleeding from the head and not moving.

Mrs Dunn was dragged 40 feet by Watkins, 27, who was behind the wheel of a dark green Chevy Tracker. 

Police have charged Watkins with  tampering with evidence, fleeing the scene of an accident and possession of drug abuse instruments.

Misquez, 31, who owns the vehicle, was charged with complicity to 
fleeing the scene of an accident.

Despair: Mike Dunn lost his wife who had been his childhood sweetheart

Watkins has been on the sex offenders' register since 2004 after an attempted unlawful sexual conduct with a female minor.

Mrs Dunn had been airlifted to University Hospital on Sunday evening but later died.

Cause of death had not yet been determined by the coroner.

Mr Dunn, who works in construction, said he was trying to raise enough money to bury his wife while supporting his three grieving children.

He said his children, in particular his daughter who watched her mother die from a window of their house, were traumatized by their mother's death.

The couple were high school sweethearts and had been together for 13 years before marrying two years ago.

Mr Dunn told the local TV station: 'My wife was killed for $130... I just hope they get what’s coming to them.'
