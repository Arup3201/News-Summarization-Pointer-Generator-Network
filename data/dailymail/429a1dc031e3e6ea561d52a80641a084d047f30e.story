A boyfriend proposed to his girlfriend when he had just six months to live - then spent the rest of his days making his bride’s dreams come true.

Chris Price, 26, promised to give 'love of his life' Ceri, 29, everything she ever wished for after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer.

The pair had a plush church wedding with Ceri’s four children as the guests of honour.

Chris then took her and four children Halle, nine, and triplets Evan, Morgan and Georgia, six, to Disneyland Paris.

And they had only been home a few weeks when he whisked Ceri off to New York for a weekend of sightseeing and shopping.

Chris then splashed out on the £500 pair of Louboutin shoes - and a £900 Mulberry handbag Ceri had always wanted.

The loving husband then booked to take Ceri to Las Vegas for her birthday... but sadly he ran out of time.

Chris died in Ceri’s arms last month and his funeral was held in the church where the pair had married just six months earlier.

Heartbroken Ceri said: 'It was as if Chris wanted to spend his last days making me as happy as he could.

'We did such a lot in those last six months.

'He was so positive he never talked about dying, he just wanted to see me and the children happy in the time he had left.'

Ceri told how maintenance inspector Chris loved to surprise her and his four stepchildren.

She said: 'The Disney trip was something we had talked about in the future but when Chris knew he didn’t have long he booked for all of us to go.

'Then he told me he’d arranged a romantic trip for us in Dublin but on the way to the airport he told me we were going to New York.

'We had the most magical time and I will savour those memories forever.

'He knew I had fancied a pair of Louboutin boots but they were way too expensive for me to ever afford them.

'But Chris bought them for me and got me an even more expensive Mulberry handbag.'

The pair had known each other since being teenagers - and moved in together when romance blossomed in January 2012.

Chris was fit and healthy - and hadn’t been to see his doctor for more than 10 years.

But he started having stomach pains and tests revealed he had cancer of the oesophagus in April 2012.

Though Chris was given the all clear, his cancer returned a year later

Chris, of Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, underwent an eight-hour operation where doctors had to remove part of his stomach because the cancer had spread.

He was later given the all clear but in April 2013 scans revealed secondary cancer in his liver and lungs.

He was told there was no cure but chemotherapy could prolong his life. He passed away in January 2014.

Ceri said: 'If my love could have saved him, he would have lived forever.

'We packed so much into the short time we had together.

'His illness made him live completely in the moment and he taught me to do the same.

'He died in my arms and I felt his last breath.

'My heart is broken losing him and I still spray his Aramis aftershave and wear his clothes to feel close to him.

'He loved me and took me on with four children as if they were his own. They loved him so much too.'

Brave Ceri said that although she has been left heartbroken she will always treasure the last six months of happiness they had together.

She said: 'I have no regrets - we accepted what was going to happen and we savoured every single second we had together.

'At his funeral we played his favourite song Robin S - Show Me Love.

'That’s all he ever did was show everyone he met love. I miss him every moment of every day.'

Chris tragically passed away in January: 'All he ever did was show everyone he met love. I miss him every moment of every day,' says Ceri
