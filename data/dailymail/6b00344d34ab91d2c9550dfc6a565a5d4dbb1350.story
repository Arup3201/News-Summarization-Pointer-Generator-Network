A grieving daughter had to be rushed to hospital after a coffin carrying her 290lb father snapped as it was lifted by pallbearers.

'I saw my father die twice,' said Debora Sebastianelli of the moment the dead man's  corpse spilled from his casket in the middle of his funeral.

'I was already under shock over his sudden death, then this upset me. I went out into the street screaming, I ended up in the emergency room with high blood pressure,' she told Il Messagero.

'I saw my father die twice': Debora Sebastianelli with her late father Maurizio, who died of a heart attack. She had to be taken to hospital after the coffin carrying his corpse snapped in the middle of his funeral 

Maurizio Sebastianelli, from Rome, had died without warning just days earlier, leaving his 23-year-old daughter, an only child, to take care of the funeral arrangements.

She insists she warned undertakers in advance of the need for a reinforced coffin for her 290lb, 6ft tall father - and paid extra for one - so expected she had anticipated any weight-related calamities.

But the material used in Mr Sebastianelli's coffin could not hold him. 'It snapped, they’d just lifted it up to take it away and there was a thud,' Miss Sebastianelli said.

'We had to take him in the church with a cover to hide the mess.'

Quick-thinking funeral directors found a sheet of zinc to place beneath Mr Sebastianelli's coffin, but it was too late to save his daughter and other mourners from humiliation.

'It was a demeaning display,' she said. 'I watched my father and I was ashamed. He had been unlucky in life - died at age 52 of a heart attack - and was so even in death.'

Big man: Miss Sebastianelli insists she warned undertakers in advance of the need for a reinforced coffin for her 290lb, 6ft-tall father - and paid extra for one - so she didn't expect any weight-related calamities

Miss Sebastianelli's  grief was compounded after the catastrophe delayed Mr Sebastianelli's funeral mass. His burial also had to be postponed until the next day.

Now she says she is planning to sue the undertakers over the accident.

'I want Ama funeral services to pay for the damage done to my family,' she said. 'I had to borrow the money for my father's funeral and I saw him die a second time.'
