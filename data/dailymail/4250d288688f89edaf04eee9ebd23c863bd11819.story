A family in Russia are mourning the death of their one month old baby boy after he was crushed to death in the doors of an elevator.

Anya Tikhonenko, 28, was with her baby Sasha after visiting friends and decided to take the lift from the top of an apartment block in St. Petersburg to the ground floor, according to reports.

When it arrived and the doors opened she pushed Sasha's pram in - but before it was all the way inside, the doors started to close.

'I pushed my hand through the crack as the doors slammed against the pram in a bid to reach the stop button but it was too late,' said Anya.'The doors closed and the lift moved down. The pram was sliced in half when the top of the lift came down.'

The baby was crushed to death and his little body retrieved by emergency workers from the elevator on the ground floor.

Happy family: Sasha was the second child of Anya and Andrey Tikhonenko, the 28-year-old father of the baby. Aleksey, his elder brother aged two, was with a relative when the accident happened

Sasha was the second child of Anya and Andrey Tikhonenko, the 28-year-old father of the baby. Aleksey, his elder brother aged two, was with a relative when the accident happened.

His death has triggered sudden inspections of all the elevators in apartment blocks in the area where he died. The lift in which he died was made in 1981 and should have been replaced a decade ago, according to media reports.

Police are advising that mothers with babies should remove them from baby carriages before they enter elevators.

'This is a terrible tragedy, and it's a mystery how it happened but we are looking into it,' said a spokesman.
