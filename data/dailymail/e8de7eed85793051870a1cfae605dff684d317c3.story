George Osborne believes Britain’s exit from the European Union is ‘no longer unthinkable’ and is backed by more than ‘just the crazies and the bores’, a new book claims.

The revelation comes as the Tory party threatens to tear itself apart over Europe in the wake of the dramatic defection of MP Douglas Carswell to UKIP.

An updated biography of Mr Osborne claims the Chancellor’s view of the EU has ‘hardened’ since coming to power in 2010 and he could now see how the UK could sever ties with Brussels.

Chancellor George Osborne is said to have 'hardened' his views on Europe since taking office, and now takes seriously the prospect of Britain severing ties with Brussels

David Cameron is under growing pressure to set out a tougher stance on Europe, with up to 100 Tory MPs set to defy the Prime Minister by pledging to vote to leave the EU no matter how much power he manages to claw back from Brussels.

Such a move would be widely seen as a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister’s ability to win a good deal for Britain as part of his plans for a renegotiation of powers before an in-out referendum.

Mr Carswell, the former Tory MP who defected to Ukip last week, claimed that that Mr Cameron was not ‘serious’ about EU reform and wanted to recommend an ‘in’ vote.

There is speculation that Mr Cameron will use his speech to the Conservative conference next month to say he will back an exit from the EU if he fails to overhaul Britain’s membership.

Mr Osborne, who is expected to play a key role in the renegotiation, is now said to consider leaving the EU a possibility, according to an updated version of George Osborne: The Austerity Chancellor, by Janan Ganesh.

Mr Osborne also fears the two-speed EU, with some countries inside the Eurozone and others like Britain on the outside, might not last.

According to extracts of the book published by The Times, Mr Ganesh writes that Mr Osborne’s views on Europe have hardened since becoming Chancellor.

‘He remained a supporter of British membership and shook his head at the casualness with which some colleagues talked of exit.’

However he has arrived at two conclusions. ‘The first was that exit was no longer unthinkable: a sequence of events leading to that end could be imagined, and it was not just the crazies and the bores who were enthused by this.’

The second conclusion was that the countries outside the Eurozone were suffering.

‘The currency bloc was becoming the real decision-making crucible and voting weights were shifting in its favour on matters of vital British interest, such as banking.’

In speech in January, Mr Osborne said the Tory plan for renegotiation was is to ‘change the EU and to change Britain’s relationship with it, and then to place the decision in the hands of the British people: do you want to stay in a reformed Europe, or would you prefer to leave?’

But at the time he stressed that his preference was to remain in the EU.
