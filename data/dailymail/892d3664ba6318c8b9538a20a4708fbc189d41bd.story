Birthdays at football clubs are often underwhelming affairs - but fans of Colombian side Independiente Medellin ensured they celebrated theirs in style by unveiling a banner the size of the entire stadium!

In commemoration of their 101st year as a side, a banner spanning all four stands of their Atanasio Stadium was displayed by the 45,000 supporters crammed into the arena for their match on Sunday.

And the team did not disappoint, grabbing a 3-2 victory over rivals Deportivo Cali.
