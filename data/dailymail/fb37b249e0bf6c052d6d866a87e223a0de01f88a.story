David Moyes has vowed that Wayne Rooney will not be sold by Manchester United.

The new Old Trafford boss faced the media on Friday for the first time since he was confirmed as Sir Alex Ferguson’s successor almost two months ago, and inevitably faced a barrage of questions about the unsettled England striker.

Moyes stopped short of confirming that Rooney – who is understood to have told Ferguson that he wants to leave towards the end of last season – has changed his mind, but insisted that he will be staying at the club.

'Wayne is not for sale,' he said. 'He's a Manchester United player and he will remain a Manchester United player.'

'We have spoken several times. Whatever happened before with Wayne we are working together now. I’ve seen a glint in his eye, he looks happy and he looks like he is going to knuckle down. I’m looking forward to working with him and he won’t be for sale.

'There was a private meeting between Wayne and Sir Alex. I am moving on now. I don't know what was said in that private meeting. As far as I am concerned, I am looking forward to getting Wayne Rooney to the right level. 

'He has come back in good shape and he’s excellent in the training sessions.'

Speculation: Rumours surrounding Rooney's future had been rife but Moyes has kept the calm

Moyes believes Rooney can still become a United ‘legend’ if puts the turmoil of the past few months behind him and signs a new contract.

He said: ‘I think if I was Wayne, you would look at the legends who have played at this club. You see their pictures at the training ground - George Best, Bobby Charlton, Roy Keane, I could go on. And I thought to myself, Wayne is not too far away from that. It isn't too difficult to get the goals and if he could do that, he would be seen in the same light as those people.

‘What we're looking to do is see how we can get Wayne Rooney scoring those goals, which will challenge the likes of Bobby Charlton and Denis Law's numbers.

‘We are working and trying everything to get Wayne to the level where we think he should be. Not only that, this country will have a World Cup to play in next year, so for everybody’s benefit, we are trying to get him back to the Wayne Rooney we all know.’

Moyes, 50, has joined United on a six-year contract after 11 years at Everton.

He revealed that Ferguson invited him to his house in Cheshire and effectively told him that he would be his successor.

‘It was a strange situation,’ he added. ‘I had no idea whatsoever. I knew nothing until ir Alex Ferguson gave me a call and asked me to come to his house. I was expecting him to say he was taking one of my players at Everton.

‘But the first thing he said was “I’m retiring”. I asked when and he said “next week!”. His next words were, “You’re the next Manchester United manager”. I didn’t get a chance to say yes or no. I was told I was the next United manager and that was enough.

‘I was incredibly privileged but it was more shock. The blood drained from my face. But I always hoped I would be a consideration.’

Moyes acknowledged the challenge he 
faces to maintain the success Ferguson brought to Old Trafford, and 
admitted that it will e impossible to replicate.

But
he insisted that he will do things his own way and not be intimidated 
by his fellow Scot staying on as a director and club ambassador.

‘I’m
looking forward to him sitting behind me in the director’s box,’ said 
Moyes. ‘I’ve got to say he is someone I will use for advice.

‘Sir Alex Ferguson will never go away. His statue his here and his name is on the stand. It is impossible to match him and do it for 26 years at this level. I don’t think there will be another manager who will do it for that long. His achievements means there are no better.

'Time will tell on the future. Any 
football manager wants to manage here. All I can do is what David Moyes 
has done before. I will definitely continue the traditions of Manchester
United but put my own stamp on the club.

‘I
am fortunate to take over champions of England. Success is tattooed 
across badge of this club. This job is about winning trophies and it is 
something I am wanting to do. It will not change me, I’m determined to 
try to get the first one on the board.

‘I am inexperienced in a lot of 
things. There are some brilliant managers who could have taken this role
but the biggest confidence I can take is Sir Alex Ferguson telling me 
he wanted me for this role.

‘I hope he is sitting in the directors box. I have already called him two or three times for some advice.’

Moyes added Ryan Giggs and Phil Neville to his coaching staff on Thursday, and said he hopes to bring Paul Scholes back to the club in some capacity in the future following his retirement at the end of last season.

He would not expand on United’s pursuit of Barcelona midfielder Thiago Alcantara and his old Everton defender Leighton Baines, admitting that some deals may not be in place before the team leaves for a pre-season tour of Australia and Asia on Wednesday.

‘I will try to have players in before the tour but I would not like to say yes,’ he said. ‘The way the transfer window is things might be done later. Not everything will be done straightaway.

‘I would never speak about players at other clubs. I would try to answer as many questions as I can. This club is always interested in the best players.

‘I’ve only been the manager since July 1. This club will always go for the best players and will always go for the best young players.

‘We tried to introduce players at Everton the best we could, and it’s in the DNA here to bring in our own players from the youth set-up.’

Moyes admitted that he could not remember United having to face a tougher start, with the champions facing Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool in their first five games.

But he welcomed the return of Jose Mourinho at Chelsea and the challenge of Manuel Pellegrini’s arrival at City.

‘I think there will be improvements from all the clubs,’ he added. ‘I’m pleased to see Jose back and we will enjoy having him back.

‘I have come across Pellegrini before and it will be new to him. There has been a big shake-up and there is a lot of things unknown, not just at this club but a few others.

‘I think the priority is doing well in all the competitions. We have to go for everything, you attempt to win everything. I’ve done it everywhere else I’ve been.

‘We will play exciting football, the way Manchester United play – but the biggest thing is to win.

‘I would always put winning at the top of the list and I’m sure Sir Alex Ferguson would as well. If you have an entertaining team and don’t win then you’re not going anywhere.’
