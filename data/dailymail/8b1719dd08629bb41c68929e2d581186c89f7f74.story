Get ready to fire up your barbecue as the heatwave continues.

Forecasters say tomorrow could be the hottest day of the year so far, and are predicting sunny, dry conditions for most of the country this weekend.

The record for the hottest day  stands at 26.5C (79F) in Writtle, Essex, on June 9, which was then followed by flash flooding and weather warnings.

Commuters shed their jackets as they cross London Bridge on the way to work in glorious sunshine yesterday. Behind them, and way up above, sun reflects off the Shard, London's tallest building. Temperatures in the Capital today were due to hit 24C

With the sky glowing a breathtaking orange, you may be forgiven for thinking this was a Mediterranean sunrise in the south of France. But this stunning scene was captured over Marsden beach, on South Tyneside yesterday as Britain prepares for soaring temperatures this weekend

With the sun shining and regular rainfall in recent weeks, these poppies are in full bloom at Blackstone Farm Fields Nature Reserve near Bewdley, Worcestershire. Although there could be some showers in the midlands over the weekend, conditions are due to be settled well into next week

But the Met Office says temperatures may pass the 27C (81F) mark  in the South East tomorrow.

The UK is expected to be as hot as Gibraltar tomorrow, and hotter than Paris (24C) and Berlin (22C).

The sunshine in the South is set to continue, albeit slightly cooler, for the rest of the weekend.

Met Office forecaster Mark Wilson said: ‘Thursday is set to be a fine day in the South with plenty of sunshine. Coastal areas will get the most amount of sunshine. There may be more cloud in the North. Temperatures will reach the mid-20s across England and could be as high as 25C in London and the South East. Friday is set to be a similar picture and temperatures could rise to 27C, which could make it the hottest day of the year.’

The North of the country may  not be as fortunate, with the weather expected to deteriorate tomorrow, with more cloud and patchy rain. However, it should pick up again on Saturday and Sunday with temperatures reaching the 20s. Mr Wilson added: ‘It is still expected to be a warm day further north despite the chance of showers.’

Forecast for Friday, Saturday and Sunday

Purple haze: Visitors enjoy the sunshine and rhododendrons at the National Trust's Cragside estate in Northumberland yesterday

In bloom: The sprawling estate was once the home of Victorian inventor Lord Armstrong - and was the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectricity

Flora: The grounds of the National Trust estate feature one of the largest rock gardens in Europe, as well as Nelly's Labyrinth, a network of paths and tunnels cut out of a vast area of rhododendron forest

The sun emerges over the horizon in a stunning sunrise captured from a cave at Marsden beach on South Tyneside. Fine temperatures are set to last well into next week

Saturday will cool off slightly in the south but is not expected be  a washout. While there may a chance of the occasional shower, temperatures are still forecast to reach a stunning 24C.

Sunday and Monday are predicted to be warm, with temperatures in the mid-20s in the South and very little chance of rain.

In the North there may be more cloud about, but temperatures should still be above average for this time of year. Above average  is defined as higher than 15C (59F).

The Met Office’s long-range prediction – called the seasonal forecast – suggested earlier in the week that the summer of 2014 could turn out to be in the top ten hottest ever recorded.

They added that there was a 25 per cent chance it would be the hottest ever.

Britain has been basking in unbroken sunshine this week, with the mercury consistently climbing into the 20s.

John Keggin took advantage of the glorious conditions to head out to sea. But he got more than he bargained for as a giant basking shark swims past his kayak off Port Erin on the Isle of Man

John Keggin set out for a paddle with a few friends from Port Erin on the Isle of Man but within moments, a basking shark breached the surface right in front of him. The giant creatures are regularly spotted in the waters around the island between late May and July but it is extremely rare to get this close to them
