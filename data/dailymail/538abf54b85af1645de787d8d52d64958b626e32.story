A warehouse worker has been sacked after breaking a dress code banning him from wearing Calvin Klein underpants to work.

Aaron Barnard had worked at the DHL 
warehouse in Sherburn, West Yorks for three months when bosses gave him 
his marching orders - following a routine spot check.

Managers claim he signed a contract promising not to wear Calvin Klein underwear, because it's distributed from the factory - but the 22-year-old insists he has serial numbers that prove he didn't steal the pants and is accusing his bosses of forcing him out.

Fired for wearing pants: Aaron Barnard with the offending underwear that cost him his job at a DHL warehouse in Sherburn, Yorkshire

Mr Barnard had just finished his 2pm until 10pm shift when he was spot-checked and made to show his pants and socks to his supervisor.

When they realised that Aaron was wearing Calvin Klein boxer shorts he was asked not to return to the factory.

The company claim when Aaron was hired he agreed to the dress code.

But Aaron, of Selby, North Yorkshire, claims the contract didn't say he would face instant dismissal and he insist he is not the first person to have broken the rule.

Aaron Barnard believes bosses used the underpants incident as an excuse to get rid of him

He said: 'I don’t want people thinking I’m a trouble causer, I just want to work,
but I need to clear my name - I am not a thief.

I know I shouldn’t have
had the boxers on and can’t think why I did - you just don’t think 
about it sometimes. It’s really harsh saying I can’t return and their motives are questionable.

'I
was getting to the point where I would be getting a full contract with 
more employee rights and I think they’ve got rid of me before that 
point.

'They offer no uniform and it definitely did not say in my contract that I would be sacked, other people have been caught and they’ve been let off with a warning.

'I haven’t done anything wrong. It was an honest mistake other people have made in the warehouse. They treated me like I had stolen them until I emailed them a picture of the serial number but they treated me like a thief.

'You can see the boxers aren’t new. You just put your boxer shorts on in the morning and go to work.'

He added: 'I’ve never even seen the boxer shorts being packed in the depot. I worked on shoes and handbags, sorting the boxes to be distributed out.”

Aaron got the DHL job through recruitment agency Blue Arrow. In an attempt to clear his name he sent them a photo of his shorts label serial number to prove they hadn’t been processed at the Hurricane Way distribution park depot.

Aaron recorded a phone call the day after his dismissal in which a Blue Arrow employee confirmed DHL don’t want him to return.

He tells Aaron he would need to produce a receipt for his boxer shorts to prove they weren’t from the DHL depot, but assures him theft allegations won’t go on his file.

Blue Arrow have told Aaron he can continue to operate for them elsewhere but not back at DHL in Sherburn.

Pants: Mr Barnard has serial numbers that he claims prove his boxer shorts were shipped from a different warehouse

'With the serial number you can prove the boxers hadn’t come through the DHL warehouse,' said Aaron.

'Calvin Klein will have all the serial numbers and release dates of those boxer shorts.'

He added: “The managers got on with me. I was a good worker and I worked hard.

It seems a bit of a coincidence I was coming up to getting on a permanent contract.'

Aaron claims he knows of other DHL employees who’ve been caught wearing Calvin Kleins, but escaped with warnings.

A Blue Arrow spokeswoman said: 'All of our employees working on the contract are made fully aware at start point of employment on the required dress code, and the consequences of not adhering to that policy.'
