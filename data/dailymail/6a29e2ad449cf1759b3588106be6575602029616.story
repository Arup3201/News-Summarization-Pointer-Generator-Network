World Cups offer plenty of opportunity
 for TV pundits but the two biggest managerial names look to have priced
 themselves out of contention.

Pep
 Guardiola’s representatives are understood to have asked for £250,000 
for the world’s best-paid boss to be part of ITV’s coverage of the 
semi-finals and final in South Africa in 2010.

And it is believed it would take that sort of offer, or more, to tempt Jose Mourinho to be a TV analyst in Brazil.

An interim report into the findings of the controversial England Commission to improve the national team will be delivered to the FA board by FA chairman Greg Dyke on Thursday.

Dyke has taken personal responsibility for the project, writing a lot of the conclusions himself despite his numerous other business interests.

He is expected to pinpoint where the 
process is wrong on the pathway from grassroots football to selection 
for the England senior team.

Task ahead: FA Chairman Greg Dyke will present an interim report into the findings from the commission

Criticism: Board member Heather Rabbatts said the Commission did not have enough ethnic diversity

An obvious major problem is the number of potential international players who fall by the wayside through lack of opportunity in the 18 to 21 age group.

Two solutions discussed are a quota system to ensure a set number of English players in club academies — championed by commission member Glenn Hoddle — and the introduction of Premier League feeder clubs.

But highlighting the difficulties Dyke faces in bringing about change are that quotas are against European law and would be strongly opposed by the Premier League — as would feeder clubs by the Football League, whose members dismissed the idea at their last meeting.

More likely is beefing up a Premier League Under 21/23 competition to give young players a springboard.

Wish: Dyke seeks to allow more young English talent like Ross Barkley to come through the ranks

Added: Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand was added to the commission

Get me out: England players had to wait around for hours after the gut-wrenching defeat in Paris

The amateur traditions of the Six Nations seem increasingly at odds with the elite professional game.

It
 has emerged that England captain Chris Robshaw told management that the
 players were tired of the speeches and wanted to go when the French 
Rugby Federation reception after the Paris game dragged on past 
midnight.

Stuart 
Lancaster’s wife Nina had to intervene to ensure the WAGs had a seat on 
the England coach back to the hotel after the late night as no provision
 had been made for their transport.      ..............................................................................................

England Rugby 2015 have surprisingly decided against having their own World Cup mascot on parade around the grounds.

Part of the complication is that rugby’s ruling body the IRB hold licensing rights and have signed popular children’s animation figure Shaun the Sheep to help promotion.

London 2012, from where a considerable number of ER 2015 staff were hired, received a mixed response for their Olympic mascot Wenlock.

Miami heat on Wayne

Wayne
 Rooney, whose new £300,000-a-week Manchester United contract has the 
club’s commercial hot house helping him maximise his personal earnings, 
is likely to be centre stage during England’s pre-World Cup week in 
Miami.

England shirt 
suppliers Nike are sure to want to get Rooney alongside their marquee 
basketball star LeBron James of Miami Heat — another swoosh team.

Rooney’s
 astonishing new deal is slightly more than James earns from his club 
but the American rakes in another £25million a year from endorsements.

The FA have a tentative invite to watch the NBA play-offs that week if Miami qualify and the date suits the training schedule.

Back on court in Miami: Rooney, seen here with then-girlfriend Coleen at an NBA game between New York Knicks and Boston Celtics in 2006, may be shooting some hoops alongside LeBron James this summer

England manager Roy Hodgson outflanked representatives from all the home nations subject to a long wait at Nice airport when the last BA flight back to Heathrow was delayed after the Euro 2016 draw in Nice.

Hodgson and his FA colleagues quickly grabbed the final three seats on a Gatwick flight even though it meant travelling in economy.

West Brom sponsors Zoopla, who announced they would not be renewing their shirt sponsorship when striker Nicolas Anelka was allowed to continue to play after his quenelle gesture, told the club they did not expect to be invited into the directors’ box as a result.

But West Brom have still made the property company representatives welcome whenever they want to attend a game.
