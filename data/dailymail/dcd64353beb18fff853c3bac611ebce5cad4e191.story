A Texas mother posted an open letter on her blog Monday urging her 13-year-old daughter to use Miley Cyrus as a example of the kind of girl she should never become.

Kim Keller of Frisco runs a blog called Roadkill Goldfish and used it to vent the extreme anger she felt after watching Cyrus’s now-infamous Video Music Award performance.

Thirty-six hours later, the letter titled Dear Daughter, Let Miley Cyrus Be a Lesson to You had gained 3 million views.

Incited: Texas blogger and mom Kim Keller was so shocked by Miley Cyrus's VMA performance that she wrote an open letter to her daughter titled Dear Daughter, Let Miley Cyrus Be a Lesson To You

‘If you ever even consider doing something like that, I promise you that I will run up and twerk so you will see how ridiculous twerking looks,’ Keller wrote. ‘I will duct tape your mouth shut so your tongue doesn't hangout like an overheated hound dog.’

Humor like that runs throughout Keller’s heartfelt letter, which as of Thursday evening had received 1,400 comments.

‘I’m sorry if you’ve ever felt demoralized because your Instagram following isn’t in the thousands. I’m sorry those “selfies” can never capture how amazingly beautiful you truly are.’

In addition to laughs, the letter offers straightforward advice.

Keller posted her letter on Monday and by Thursday it had 3 million views and thousands of comments

All grown up? Cyrus's performance made Keller 'absolutely angry,' after years of watching her children's show Hannah Montana with her daughter

Cyrus's performance has won her as many fans as detractors and she has shown no desire to apologize for her risque choices

A different time: Keller has argued that 20-year-old Cyrus, seen here in her child star days, may not be a role model but she is a public figure with an underage following

‘You probably know girls who will emulate this behavior at the next school dance,’ she wrote. ‘Don’t do it with them. You are far too valuable to sell yourself so cheaply.’

Part of Keller’s frustration, and part of what drove her to write the wildly popular letter, came from the years Keller and her daughter spent watching Cyrus’s Disney program together.

The massive response to Keller's letter won her invitations to Good Mornign America and Piers Morgan and she even wrote a post script response to critics who called her prudish

In the years after Hannah Montana, Keller believes Cyrus has been dying for attention and that the most recent, and blatant, attempt at it made her ‘absolutely angry.’

In a chat with Good Morning America, Keller also offered Cyrus some motherly advice.

‘If I could say anything to Miley, I would say this: 'Honey you are beautiful, you are valuable, you are loved, and you don't have to do this for attention. This is not who God created you to be,”’ she said.

The final sentence of Keller’s letter probably sums it up best: ‘You can thank me later.’
