France set themselves up for their last-day showdown with title-chasing England at Twickenham by shutting out Italy in Rome yesterday.

Coach Philippe Saint-Andre praised his side’s resilience after they bounced back from two successive defeats in the Six Nations to overcome Italy in a scrappy match.

Les Bleus scored two tries and five penalties to seal an emphatic victory at the Stadio Olimpico after a dour first half in which a wet ball and rain-soaked pitch led both sides into a string of handling errors.

France went into the break leading 9-0 after two penalties from fly-half Camille Lopez and one from full-back Scott Spedding but broke away in the second half with tries from second-rower Yoann Maestri and replacement centre Mathieu Bastareaud.

Replacement Jules Plisson converted both tries and added two penalties.

The relentless French defence, with only one missed tackle all match, stifled any hope for Italy.

‘We had a team today that’s for sure. In terms of commitment and aggression and defensively as well,’ Saint-Andre said, singling out flanker Thierry Dusautoir, celebrating his 50th match as captain.

‘Our scrum was of very high quality,’ the coach added.

Dusautoir acknowledged that after defeats by Ireland and Wales, France were under pressure to produce ahead of the trip to Twickenham.

‘It was a big test today. In our last few matches, we weren’t able to find this defiance, or quality or this hunger,’ he said. ‘The first half maybe wasn’t very productive but it wore them down and it allowed us to end the match well,’ he said.

Going in to the final weekend of the Six Nations, four teams - England, Ireland, Wales and France - are still in with a shout of claiming the trophy. Here's how each can be victorious.
