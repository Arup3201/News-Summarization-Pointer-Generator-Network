When Toni Duggan sings the National Anthem at Wembley before England play Germany on Sunday afternoon, it will be the realisation of a dream formed in the gym of a Liverpool youth club, where she played against boys four years older.

‘The fact there’ll be 55,000 people singing it back at me makes you realise how far you’ve come as an individual but also as women footballers,’ said Duggan, ‘It was always our aim to raise the profile of the game and I believe it’s only going to get bigger.’

This is the first time an England women’s game will be played at the new Wembley. Demand for tickets for the friendly far outstripped that for the men’s friendly against Norway in September and there might have been an even bigger crowd were it not for engineering works on London’s transport system putting a cap on ticket sales.

‘We sold out for our capacity,’ said Duggan. ‘Who knows, in the future if we get invited back to Wembley again it could be a bit higher.

‘I’ve been to Wembley before to watch Liverpool and Everton in the FA Cup semi-final in 2012. I saw the atmosphere there and I didn’t ever think women’s football would be played in front of those crowds in my time.’

Duggan’s love of the game began on the playing fields of her primary school and at her local youth club where she watched her older brothers play and had a kickabout on the sidelines.

‘I played with lads four years older than me,’ said Duggan. ‘It brought me on physically and mentally and challenged me a lot more than when I played with the girls because there weren’t that many girl footballers about.

‘When I was 12 I was told I couldn’t play with the boys any more and I was devastated. I’d recommend for any little girl starting out to play with the boys as long as possible.’

‘A lot of the boys I played with went on to play non-League and they come and watch me sometimes.

‘I remember as a kid scouts from Liverpool and Everton would come along and I’d try to impress them and they’d look at me like, “You’re not a boy”. But even at Man City now if someone comes along to watch us train I’ll be putting in the extra 20 per cent to make sure they know women’s football is a good standard. That’s the fight we’ve been fighting all our lives. That’s why the Wembley game is so big — we’re finally winning the battle.’

Duggan, 23, joined Everton as a teenager but last year she was lured to Manchester City, another Women’s Super League side who are at the vanguard of developing women’s football at elite level.

‘If I want to be at the top Man City is the best club for me,’ said Duggan, ‘The women are treated exactly the same as the men, they’ve built a mini stadium just for the women’s team. We train with the under 18 boys.

‘That takes me back to my childhood, I get a kick out of that. I see the likes of Sergio Aguero, James Milner or Yaya Toure around the building and they will say they’ve watched our games sometimes.’

Anyone who has seen Duggan’s sweetly struck volleyed goal against Chelsea which was judged FA goal of the month cannot deny the skill level of women’s football. Duggan, who is fond of a pair of fake eyelashes and manicured nails, says people should not be deceived by her appearance.

‘Being feminine and sporty is not mutually exclusive,’ she said. ‘That’s just the way I am and I’m not going to change that because I’m a footballer.

‘I’m a totally different person when I go on the pitch. You can judge me and say I like to look after my nails or I want to wear false eyelashes but it doesn’t mean I’m going to pull out of a 50-50 challenge. I think it’s good that there are a couple of girls on the team who are a lot more feminine and it’s important that girls have different role models.

The 23-year-old forward has represented her country 16 times and scored 12 goals

‘It’s important that people are judged on their footballing ability first and foremost. It doesn’t mean to say because someone else isn’t as feminine they’re not as good.’

Duggan knows there will be no scope for worrying about chipped nail varnish against Germany. The visitors have won seven out of the last eight European Championships, as well as two of the last three World Cups and will provide a stern assessment of Mark Sampson’s side.

Germany cruised through the qualifying campaign for the World Cup with 10 wins, including a 10-0 thrashing of Montenegro. ‘I wouldn’t want any other opposition for this big stage,’ said Duggan. ‘If we want to be at the top of our game, we need to be playing in front of 55,000 against one of the best teams in the world and people can see how good we are.’
