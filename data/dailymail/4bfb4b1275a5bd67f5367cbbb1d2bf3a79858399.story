Edin Dzeko has backed Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini to bring more silverware to the club despite their recent poor form.

City struggled to a 2-2 draw with QPR on Saturday, four days after their hopes of reaching the Champions League knockout stages were left in serious doubt after a home defeat to CSKA Moscow.

But Dzeko, who was forced off with an injury at Loftus Road, believes his team-mates are pleased with the current regime and are still in the hunt for more trophies.

Premier League appearances: 10

Goals: 2 

Assists: 1

Chances created: 6

Shot accuracy: 31 per cent 

Asked whether the squad were happier under Pellegrini than former manager Roberto Mancini, Dzeko told Bleacher Report: 'I don't like to talk too much about differences between managers. We won the title and FA Cup with (Roberto) Mancini, and Community Shield as well, so we had a good time with him.

'It's normal that the manager is changing; the players are changing, so you have to get used to each manager, and now we already won two cups in the first year with the new manager, and we're doing well, we're happy, and hopefully we can win more.'

The Bosnian striker has appeared in all but one Premier League game this season, scoring twice to help the champions to third place in the table behind leaders Chelsea and Southampton.

And despite less playing-time since the return to fitness of Sergio Aguero, Dzeko insists that Pellegrini has helped him discover his best form while in England. 

He added: I think it's important for every player to feel the confidence of the manager. I feel it since he came here, and I'm just doing my best. 

'Sometimes you score; sometimes you can't score. It's just football, but you have to give your best, and I think we play fantastic here. Last season, personally, was my best, so hopefully we can continue this year.'
