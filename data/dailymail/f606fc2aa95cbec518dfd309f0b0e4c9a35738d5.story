One man has been charged and three others are being quizzed on suspicion of terror offences linked to Syria's civil war.

Jamshed Javeed was charged with the intention of assisting others to commit acts of terrorism and engaging in conduct in preparation for giving effect to his intention.

The 29-year-old, of Cringle Road in Levenshulme, Manchester, will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London today.

It came after police investigating people suspected of travelling to or supporting the fighting in Syria made four arrests yesterday.

Two men, aged 29 and 18, and a 21-year-old woman were still being held for questioning in the early hours of this morning.

The 18-year-old man, also from Levenshulme, and the 21-year-old woman, from Trafford, were held in Manchester. The fourth suspect was a 29-year-old man arrested in Oxford.

They were detained on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.

A number of properties were also being searched, police said yesterday, adding that the arrests were not linked to any domestic terror threat.

Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Mole, head of the force's North West Counter-Terrorism Unit, said yesterday: 'First and foremost I should reassure everyone that none of today's activity is linked in any way to any imminent threats in Greater Manchester or the UK.

'The operation has been running since autumn 2013 since we first became aware of a number of individuals travelling from the North West to the battlefields of Syria.

'You may have seen headlines in recent months linking people from Manchester to Syria and you will naturally have been concerned about this.

'Like other major cities across the UK we have been aware for some time of people travelling to war-torn places for terrorism-related purposes.

'This is not a problem unique to Manchester or the North West - it is an issue that affects different communities across the country and elsewhere.'
