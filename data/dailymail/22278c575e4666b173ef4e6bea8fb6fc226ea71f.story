Britain has closed its embassy in Cairo over security fears, warning people not to visit the building.

Embassy officials in the Egyptian capital are working with authorities to find a way of reopening the riverside building as soon as possible.

Ambassador John Casson said on Twitter: 'Public services at the British Embassy in Cairo are suspended today for security reasons.'

The Foreign Office warned travellers to Egypt that previous attacks in the country have targeted security forces and government buildings.

The Foreign Office said in a statement: 'Public services at the British Embassy in Cairo are suspended on Sunday December 7. 

'The office of the British Consulate-General in Alexandria is operating as normal.' 

The Foreign Office warned travellers to Egypt that previous attacks in the country have targeted security forces and government buildings.

Britain's Ambassador to Egypt John Casson tweeted that the Cairo Embassy was closed for 'security reasons'

Its travel advice says: 'There is considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attacks globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.

'You should be vigilant at this time. Terrorists continue to plan attacks in Egypt. Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without prior warning.

'Foreigners could be targeted in tourist resorts or other locations frequented by foreigners. Previous attacks have almost exclusively targeted the security forces, their facilities and other government buildings. You should take great care near these places.'

A carol concert scheduled at the Ambassador's residence this evening has also been postponed.

Last year a British national was seriously injured when Sinai-based terrorist group Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, which has pledged allegiance with Isis, carried out an attack on the Egyptian interior minister in Cairo, killing two people. 

The Foreign Office advises against all travel to North Sinai, which shares a border with Israel.

It also advises 'against all but essential travel' within 31 miles of the Libya border, the majority of west Egypt and South Sinai.

Popular tourist destinations along the Nile and Red sea resorts such as Sharm el Shiekh usually remain calm during unrest in the country.
