London's latest hipster restaurant serving different versions of just one type of food opened its doors today.

And already customers have flocked to the trendy Porridge Cafe which specialises in 25 kinds of porridge made from 11 different grains and features sweet as well as savoury offerings.

The brainchild of Nik Wiliamson and Elly Harrington, the founders of food truck business The Bow Street Kitchen, it's the latest place to turn a seemingly everyday food into a gourmet experience.

Prices range from £2.35 for a bowl of basic porridge to £7 for the more hearty versions, with meat and vegetable toppings. 

But it does serve more than just plain bowlfuls of oats. 

A range of sweet offerings involve typical toppings such as apple, vanilla and hazelnut; strawberry, cinnamon and cranberry and raspberry, peach and almond - the savoury toppings veer towards the unusual.

Made with  spelt, arborio rice or grain buckwheat and quinoa, they feature slow-roasted chicken, leek and cream cheese; bacon, avocado and roasted tomato; and salami, pecorino and porcini mushroom.

Mr Williamson said: 'Our basic porridge will match Pret's prices.

'Customers will be able to top their basic porridge with sugar, jams or honey for £2.35.

A bowl of savoury porridge of slow cooked beef ragu, feta and basil will set you back £6.50

'The healthy and sweet porridges, with fruits and seeds, start at £4 while the savoury risottos start at £5.50 for the vegetarian ones. 

'The most expensive will be the ones with meat, with prices ranging from between £6 and £7.'

The inspiration behind their latest venture came about when the duo were in Scandinavia. 

Mr Williamson said: 'We were in Copenhagen and we noticed there was a lot of great porridge. We tasted different grains – in Scandinavia they use rye, buckwheat, spelt, barley and quinoa to make their porridge.

‘You would think we were sick of the stuff but the different varieties and incarnations are endless.

'We love how versatile it is and hope we can make people realise that porridge can be so much more than oats and water.’

High fibre, high protein and low GI, porridge has long been known as the perfect food as part of a balanced diet. 

‘Eating porridge regularly can also help reduce stress due to the presence of magnesium in many grains,' Mr Williamson added.

The partners discovered the huge amount of grains that are used to make porridge all over the world, along with the different methods to make it.

They finally decided on 11 grains which they think ‘taste great’.

‘All in all we've chosen 11 grains we think taste great and have some really great health benefits,' he said.

‘The recipes we've developed are sweet, healthy and savoury flavours.'

The cafe will open on 2 March on Paul Street, near Old Street station, London, and will serve from 7am to 6pm daily with a daily changing menu. 

At weekends there will be a brunch menu featuring three savoury and two sweet choices.

Initially a pop-up, if the concept proves to be a success, it will become a permanent fixture.

'Our hope is in we will see whether people like it in the initial month and if they will buy our porridge,' Mr Williamson said.

'If it's successful we may extend in the location for a few more months and we will probably widen the menu so there will be other dishes involved.'

The Porridge Cafe follows on the heels of London's Cereal Killer and Belfast's Simply Crisp cafe.

Just crisps: Businessman Andrew McMenamin opened Belfast's Simply Crispy in January 2015

Belfast's Simply Crispy which opened earlier in January was the brainchild of businessman Andrew McMenamin who had planned to keep his  pop-up going for just four weeks.

But with diners queuing down the street to get their hands on the snacks, which have sold out every day, the cafe will now stay open until at least March, and could even expand to other shops in Northern Ireland, Dublin, or even London. 

'We have managed to sell out every day - not the crisps though, the bread, the baps. We can't get our hands on enough fresh baps because everything flies out of the door,' Mr McMenamin said.

In December 2014 self-confessed cereal obsessives Alan and Gary Keery launched the UK’s first cereal cafe featuring 120 cereals, 20 types of toppings and 12 varieties of milk. 

The identical twins’ establishment opened in Brick Lane, London and offers a menu of over 100 cereals from around the world.

The duo came under fire when they first opened their cafe, for charging £3.20 for a bowl of cereal.
