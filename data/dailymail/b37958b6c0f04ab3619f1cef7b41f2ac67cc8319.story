A green-fingered pensioner broke two gardening records today when he unveiled the world's biggest swede and Britain's largest carrot.

Bachelor Ian Neale, 70, broke his own record by growing a swede weighing 8 1/2 stone (54kg), and broke another record by growing a 1st 4lbs (8.35kg) carrot in his garden at home in Langstone, south Wales.

He had nurtured them using a home-made fertiliser mix perfected over 30 years, but said if the weather hadn't been so irregular his veg would have been bigger still.

'If the weather hadn't been so strange this year with the wet spring and the hot summer I think they could have been even bigger,' Mr Neale said.

'You don't set out going for the record, that's an added bonus, and it's better than sitting in a corner until you die.'

Mr Neale's swede was nearly two stone heavier than the previous world champion - which he had grown himself, while his carrot was around 7lbs heavier than the previous biggest in England.

He exhibited the record-breaking produce ahead of Autumn Show at the Three Counties Showground in Malvern, Worcestershire, which opens tomorrow to an estimated 50,000 visitors.

Supermarket worker Richard Smith, 48, from Bristol, was displaying a 16 stone (160lb/100kg) pumpkin.

He said: 'It's the biggest one I've ever grown - I just used the normal things really, such as seaweed and fish emulsion.

'It took seven weeks from pollination and I was quite impressed with myself.

The world record for biggest carrot is still held by Alaskan John Evans, who grew a 8.6 kg (18.8 lbs) whopper in 1998.
