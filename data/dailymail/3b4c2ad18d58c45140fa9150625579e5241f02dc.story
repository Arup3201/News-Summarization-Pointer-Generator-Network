The rise and rise of Conor McGregor shows no sign of slowing after the Dubliner joined champions Jon Jones and Ronda Rousey in signing a deal with Reebok.

The fitness brand recently announced a groundbreaking deal with the UFC and were quick to link up with McGregor, who faces Dennis Siver in Boston on Sunday.

Victory will set him up for a title shot against featherweight champion Jose Aldo, possibly in front of 80,000 fans in Dublin later this year.

Announcing the deal, McGregor said: ‘I believe my potential in the Octagon is limitless, but it all comes down to the training you put in pre-fight.

‘With a top fitness brand like Reebok behind me, there’s no telling what I can do in the Octagon.’

After just two years and four fights in the UFC, McGregor has become one of the promotion’s biggest stars.

President Dana White describes him as ‘without a doubt one of the most exciting fighters we have ever had in the UFC’.

McGregor is the first European to be signed to Reebok and will play a crucial role in expanding the sport.

Reebok Brand President Matt O’Toole added: ‘Conor’s hard work, determination and confidence have gotten him to where he is today.

‘His passion and his commitment to continual self-improvement are a true reflection of the Reebok brand.’
