A Chinese man has been sentenced to death after he attacked and killed a doctor who had carried out plastic surgery on his nose that he was not happy about.

The attack happened in the Ear, Nose and Throat Department of the No. 1 People's Hospital in the city of Wenling in China's Zhejiang Province last October.

Zhejiang's provincial Higher People's Court heard that Lian Enqing, 33, had been unhappy about his nose and had requested that the doctors carry out plastic surgery to improve the shape.

But afterwards he did not like the way it looked, and also claimed that it no longer worked properly and that he could not breathe easily with his nose.

His sister Liao Qiao, 27, told the court that when her brother complained to the hospital he had felt as if they did not treat his complaint with respect, and he had lost his temper.

She had appealed for the court to show leniency because her brother had mental issues.

She said: 'Only recently he was under treatment at the Shanghai Mental Health Centre, diagnosed with a persistent delusional disorder.'

But the appeal failed to sway the judges after they heard how he had pulled out a knife and stabbed the doctor, and had also badly injured a second doctor who tried to rescue the first.

The court heard that a third doctor had tried to escape but also received knife wounds.

Enqing had been sentenced to death in the first instance trial by the Intermediate People's Court in city of Zhejiang's Taizhou in January, and the sentence will now be carried out after it was confirmed by the High Court.
