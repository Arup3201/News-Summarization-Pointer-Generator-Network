When Eric Barrett was born his mother was devastated as she was told he might not survive, and would be imprisoned in his own body - unable to walk or talk.

He was put in intensive care for a couple of months before eventually being diagnosed with cerebral palsy, a physical disability that affects movement and posture.

But on Monday the 16-year-old surprised everyone when he climbed 1,437 steps to the summit of Sydney's iconic Harbour Bridge.

Thanks to sheer determination and years spent learning to walk from scratch, Eric stood 134m above sea level with 30 of his closest friends and family, with his achievement screened live on national TV by Channel 10.

'It felt surreal and amazing to reach the top,’ Eric told Daily Mail Australia after walking for the longest time in his life so far.

His mother Karen was by his side for every one of the remarkable steps over the two and a half hours.

'It was absolutely exhilarating, it was just a bit surreal that we got there to be honest,’ she added.

‘I didn’t think he would ever walk. I had no thought about it all because I didn’t want to disappoint him at all or myself.

‘He’s exhausted now and he’s not saying much. You know Eric is tired when he stops talking,’ she laughed, as they drove back to their home inTerrigal, a suburb on the Central Coast region of New South Wales.

Doctors told Karen that her son would be imprisoned in his own body after he was born

Karen came up with the idea for Eric to climb the Harbour Bridge around six months ago, four years after he took his first step, because she wanted do 'something that was a bit of challenge for him and also give back to the community’.  Network Ten's morning show Studio 10 helped make his dream a reality.

Karen doesn't get treatment for Eric from the doctors who once told her that her son would never walk, instead opting  to use alternative treatments and therapist Luke Waters - who started working with him many years ago.

She says doctors are amazed when Eric returns for his yearly X-rays and shows them just how far he has come.

Eric trained with Luke for six days a week, in the gym and walking up stairs, to climb the bridge.

‘He put in a lot of hard work,’ Karen said.

While growing up, Eric had to learn how to crawl properly before he could even contemplate learning to walk

However, the teen has essentially been training his whole life - since he had to learn how to crawl properly again and eventually take his first steps just four years ago.

‘We went left off field and right back to the basics, retraining the brain pathways and repeating movements over and over again. He used to bunny hop when he crawled around and we had to teach him to crawl properly,’ Karen explained.

‘With every bit he got he had to learn the next step… He built on everything he did every step of the way,’ she added.

Eric climbed the bridge with 30 of his friends and family. Here he is shown with his younger sister Presley and a younger brother Tommie 

The 16-year-old has a passion for sports, especially basketball, and wanted to raise money for young athletes

Eric spent 12 years of his life in a wheelchair and now that wheelchair is stowed away in the garage gathering dust.

Surgery and therapy helped him along the way but Karen points out 'there is no magic pill'.

She attributes his unbelievable achievement to his determination and strong character.

‘He never complains about training sessions, he looks forward to them and wants to do it. If he had a personality that whinged he wouldn't be up on his feet – he’s the one that’s done it.'

Eric was joined on the Harbour Bridge by Studio 10 reporter David 'Robbo' Robinson. He told Robbo 'the views are amazing' and therapist Luke said 'the smile on his face says enough'.

All funds raised by the walk will go to the Donnica Clarke Foundation, which offers financial and moral support to young athletes, across all sports from the Central Coast region of New South Wales.
