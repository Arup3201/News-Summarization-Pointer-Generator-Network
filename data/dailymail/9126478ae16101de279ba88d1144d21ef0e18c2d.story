It is one of Britain's most celebrated and historical monuments, built thousands of years ago by a dedicated team of workmen.

With no enormous diggers and machines, the workmen all lived close to Stonehenge as they developed the site.

And now, more than 4,500 years later, the huts used as temporary homes by the workmen have been reconstructed. However, there is one noticeable and rather smelly difference.

Historic: The huts used as temporary homes by the workmen who built 
Stonehenge are being reconstructed. It is unlikely, however, that the 
workmen did not live next to a pig farm all those years ago

Ancient: The huts are replicas of those lived in 4,500 years ago by workmen who built Stonehenge

Attraction: Three of the Neolithic houses will form the focal point of the new £27million visitor centre at Stonehenge

Project: A team of 60 volunteers is currently test-building the huts in a living history project at a nearby site at Old Sarum, near Salisbury, Wiltshire

It is highly likely the workers living in the temporary homes all those years ago did not have to cope with a smelly pig farm as a neighbour.

Three of the Neolithic houses which are currently being built will form the focal point of a new £27-million visitor centre at the historic attraction.

A team of 60 volunteers is currently test-building the huts in a living history project at a nearby site at Old Sarum, near Salisbury, Wiltshire. As the top picture shows, it is next to an enormous pig farm.

They are being modelled on the ruins of the biggest Neolithic settlement ever found in Northern Europe at Durrington Walls around two miles from Stonehenge.

Impressive: The huts are being modelled on the ruins of the biggest Neolithic settlement ever found in northern Europe at Durrington Walls - around two miles from Stonehenge

Looking back: English Heritage say the huts will offer an authentic glimpse of the lifestyle and technology of the Neolithic people who built Stonehenge

Fascinating: English Heritage said the settlement found near Stonehenge was probably a large temporary 'construction camp' for the monument

Ancient: The three huts will be built at the Stonehenge visitor centre around 1.5 miles to the west of the monument early next year

 The prehistoric monument of Stonehenge is one of the most famous sites in the world.

The circular earth bank and ditch which surrounds the site is believed to be the earliest part of the monument, dating back to about 3100BC.

Evidence found by archeologists indicated that Stonehenge could have been a burial ground from its earliest beginnings. Cremated human remains have been found on the site.

The site has always been a place of religious significance, particularly by Neo-druids.

There are many conspiracy theories and mysteries surrounding Stonehenge. This includes that the monument was constructed by the wizard Merlin.

Historically, many believed that the rocks at Stonehenge were healing rocks, brought from Africa by Giants.

English Heritage said the site was probably a large temporary 'construction camp' for the monument.

The
extremely rare remains of ten houses were excavated between 2006-7, 
revealing the size and layout of the floors and the stakeholes where the
walls once stood.

Radiocarbon
tests dated the buildings from around the same time that the sarsen 
stones were being put up at Stonehenge, about 2,500 BC.

But the appearance of the houses 
above ground is unknown and the project is testing different structures 
and materials - stone, straw, wood and dung - on the prototypes.

Once the best materials have been 
found three similar huts will be built at the Stonehenge visitor centre 
around 1.5 miles to the west of the monument early next year.

English
Heritage says they will offer an authentic glimpse of the lifestyle and
technology of the Neolithic people who built Stonehenge.

Working hard: Gareth Heathcote and Janey Green lay straw onto a neolithic hut roof at Old Sarum

Ambitious: Volunteers started building the prototypes at Old Sarum in early March and expect to finish the experiment in May

Experience: Those behind the project say the huts will bring visitors as close as they can to appreciate what life was like for the individuals who built Stonehenge

Susan
Greaney, senior properties historian, said: 'The stunning discovery 
made at Durrington presents us with a tantalising opportunity to do 
something special at the new visitor centre.

'The
reconstructed houses will be an immediate and sensory link to the 
distant past, and will bring visitors as close as they can to appreciate
what life was like for the extraordinary individuals who built 
Stonehenge.

'We have lots of evidence to inform this reconstruction, but there is also a lot of educated guess work.

'Building the prototypes will enable 
us to test things such as the roofing structure, roofing materials and 
various construction techniques, and learn more about late Neolithic 
people, their tools and technology, ideas of comfort and privacy and 
social organisation, among other things.'

Monument: The three huts being built are similar to those which were used to house workers who built the famous Stonehenge

Tough job: A volunteer works on a wall at one of the neolithic house recreations

Volunteers started building the prototypes at Old Sarum in early March and expect to finish the experiment in May.

The visitor centre, due to be opened 
at the end of this year, is being financed almost entirely by Heritage 
Lottery Fund money, English Heritage commercial income and donations 
from generous benefactors.

The
existing outdated facilities will be demolished and the car park will 
be grassed over and replaced by a small, security 'hub' tucked into the 
landscape.

Find: This image shows the excavations of neolithic hut floors at Durrington Walls

Discovery: The neolithic house recreations at Old Sarum are based on this excavation

Experiment: Volunteers say building the prototypes will enable them to test things such as the roofing structure and roofing materials
