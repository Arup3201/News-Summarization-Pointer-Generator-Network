A flamboyant businessman has splashed out £20million on 30 bespoke Rolls-Royce Phantoms - the biggest ever single order for the manufacturer.

As part of the deal Stephen Hung will get two of the most expensive Phantoms ever commissioned.

Mr Hung, a hugely successful Chinese retail and property investor involved in hotels and casinos, plans to use the red extended-wheelbase models as taxis to ferry clients to his ultra-posh Louis XIII hotel in Macau, when the venue opens in 2016.

The red Phantoms will be extensively customised and will include diamond-encrusted features and two will also feature external and internal gold-plated detailing

Rolls-Royce refused to say how much the deal is costing Mr Hung, but a typical extended Phantom costs more than £500,000.

The two most expensive Phantoms will feature external and internal gold-plated detailing while the fleet are thought to come with a series of diamond-encrusted features.

Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes, the boss of Rolls-Royce, confirmed the deal today and said the company was 'delighted and honoured'.

Mr Mueller-Oetvoes said the fleet of Phantoms would be 'one of most impressive sights ever seen in Macau'.

Each of the 30 Rolls-Royces will be extensively customised by Rolls-Royce's Bespoke design team at Goodwood.

Rolls-Royce has also helped to design the parking and driveways to house the fleet at Louis XIII and will train its chauffeurs how to drive them.

The hotel will have suites that cost in excess of £75,000 a night.

Mr Hung, 55, a former Hong Kong banker, was at Goodwood to sign the deal, and looked the part in an outrageous customised suit.

He said: 'Macau is rapidly evolving into the luxury capital of the world and we are honoured to have the opportunity to add to Macau's many distinctions, the world's largest fleet of Rolls-Royce Phantoms, including the two most luxurious vehicles Rolls-Royce has ever built.

'Louis XIII and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars share the same philosophy: to deliver the perfect experience to the world's most discerning customers.'
