A Copa Libertadores match between Nacional and Palestino was mysteriously brought to a halt on Thursday after tear gas was released onto the pitch - despite their being no fans in the stadium. 

Brazilian referee Heber Roberto Lopes was forced to stop the game, as the gas started to affect the players, coaching staff and himself, with many having to cover their faces to protect themselves.

Nacional fans had previously rioted with Newell's Old Boys and a stadium ban was put in place ahead of the game.

With no fans in the stadium, it is still unclear how the gas was let off in the first place. 

Despite the short hold up, the game carried on and underdogs Palestino, from Chile, went onto knock out the tournament favourites, Nacional on away goals - despite losing 2-1 in the second leg.

The Uruguayan side are currently top of their respective league, while Palestino are mid-table in the Chilean league, making this victory even more impressive.
