We all know that strong pelvic floor muscles can help with bladder problems and child birth but how far would you go to strengthen yours?

One woman has created a video tutorial on how to build muscle in your nether region. Her preferred method? Lifting weights.

Sex coach Kim Anami has curated Ten Reasons To Lift Weights With Your Vagina in which she outlines the positive effects of her bizarre activity.

Bizarre: A sex coach has unveiled a new tutorial entitled 'Ten reasons to light weights with your vagina'

'Think of it like your bicep,' she begins. 'You don't work out your arms just by flexing your muscles; you need weights. The vagina works the same way, it needs weight to create resistance in order to build strength.'

Her next reason for vagina weight lifting is that it will help you orgasm 'like never before'.

She explains that, according to studies, a strong pelvic floor has been directly linked to the intensity and frequency of a woman's orgasm.

Another one of her reasons is that the trick will help enhance your libido and make sex 'ten thousand times better.'

And, according to Anami, it isn't just the woman who'll benefit. She goes on to explain that with your new found vaginal muscles you'll be able to 'please your man like never before'.

Too far? The video, which claims you can become a world record holder, shows a woman lifting logs with her nether regions

Is your man misbehaving? Fret not. According to Anami you can discipline him with your 'new skill.'

'No need to send your man to the dog house when he's been bad,' she says. 'With your new secret weapon, he's sure to be a good boy.'

Anami also says you could become a world record holder - just like Tatyana
 Kozhevnikova, a Russian gymnast who can lift a 14kg kettleball with her private parts and officially has the world's strongest vagina.

She also puts forward some more bizarre reasons such as 'you'll become the life of the party' before showing a woman firing a ping pong ball with her vagina.

Odd: The video also gives more bizarre reasons, such as 'become the life of the party' and 'become a superhero' - even showing a woman saving a man's life using her downstairs region

'You never know when your super strong vagina will come in handy' she says before showing a man hanging by his finger tips off the edge of a cliff and a woman using her vagina and a rope to pull him to safety.

Anami, who splits her time between Bali, Los Angeles and Vancouver and describes herself as a 'provocateur, innovator, quantum leap life coach, sexual muse, liberation master and pleasure savant', runs luxury sex retreats and is a media commentator.

Writing on her website, the mother-of-one says: 'Iâ€™ve always been highly attuned to my own sexual energy and spiritual curiosity. From a young age, I had already experienced the power of sex to awaken, transform and accelerate my journey of self-actualization.

'By 22, I was practicing Tantra. I spent nearly a decade living off-grid, from pirate boats off the coast of Vancouver to the wet, sultry jungles of Indonesia. It was there - caressed by the warm air, like an omnipresent lover - that I shed my pseudo-self, and came into my life purpose.'

Tatyana
 Kozhevnikova, who showed off her skills on E4's The Body 
Shocking Show, can use just the muscles in her vagina to lift incredibly
 hefty weights.

The programme showed Kozhevnikova in all her glory utilising her record-breaking nether regions to lift 6kg dumbbells.

Kozhevnikova has already 
made her mark in the Guinness Book of World Records which recorded her 
lifting a 14kg glass ball with her genitals.

Speaking to The Morning Star in 2009, she said: 'After I had a child, my intimate muscles got unbelievably weak.

'I read books on Dao and learned that ancient women used to deal with this problem using wooden balls. 'I looked around, saw a Murano glass ball and inserted it into my vagina. It took me ages to get it out!'

Kozhevnikova uses custom-made vaginal balls and a variation of weights to strengthen her core muscles.

According
 to her website, she even offers special pelvic training programmes for 
men, which promises 'ideal buttocks in five days'.
