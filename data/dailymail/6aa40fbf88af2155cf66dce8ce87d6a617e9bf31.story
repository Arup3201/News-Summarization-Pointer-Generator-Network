Former Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan believes Cristiano Ronaldo would be keen on sealing a move back to Old Trafford in the future.

Ronaldo has been linked with a return to Manchester United during his time at Real Madrid, however a move has never come to fruition.

The 29-year-old, who worked under Phelan during his six-year career at Manchester United, is happy with life in Madrid but Phelan believes he could be tempted back to the Premier League.

Phelan, speaking to IBTimes UK, said: 'Ronaldo loved his time at Manchester United and, if Manchester United were interested in him again, then he would listen to that because part of his career has come through Man United.

'But listen, he is where he is because of him being Ronaldo and, at the moment, Madrid are successful so I can't see why he would think about coming back to Manchester United now.'

Phelan has labelled Louis van Gaal's current crop of players 'formidable' and insists United do not need to bring in many reinforcements during the January transfer window.

'Do they need to sign anyone? I'm not there anymore but what I've seen is that a full Manchester United squad going into January will be formidable,' added Phelan. 'They have quality.

'There haven't been many times when they've purchased in January apart from rare examples – [Nemanja] Vidic, [Patrice] Evra, et cetera.

'It's been the case of seeing what is out there, what you can bring in and the amount you are willing to spend. It is an inflated market.'

Patrice Evra and Nemanja Vidic are rare January transfer window success stories, according to Phelan
