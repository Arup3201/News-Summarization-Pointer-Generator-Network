It is 72 days since Steven Gerrard looked to the future and took the emotional decision to end his 114-cap England career.

He came to the conclusion that the time was right to make a clean break, having given his country 14 years’ loyal service, so he could maximise his prospects of being Liverpool’s dominant midfield influence for the next 'two, three or four' seasons.

After making public his plans, the 72 hours that followed were difficult and raw for Gerrard. England’s performance at the World Cup had been scarring but the promise of helping Liverpool move forward provided ample solace. He wanted to give his boyhood club his undivided attention.

England's disappointing performance at the World Cup will have been difficult for Gerrard to take 

There were also reassuring words from Brendan Rodgers.

‘A lot has gone on over the summer,’ said Rodgers, during Liverpool’s tour of the United States. ‘I am very happy that Steven is going to commit to Liverpool and I am sure that (his contract) is something we will look at. I know he can continue to play beyond this season.

‘I have always said that. Now he doesn’t have international football, he will have that freshness. Listen, for his own mind, I am sure he will want it sorted out, absolutely. You never want to leave players with not too long to go on their contracts. It is something I am sure will get sorted.’

It was intimated in the same conversation that Gerrard signing a new deal was a formality but, two and a half months on, there is an element of uncertainty starting to swirl around. Discussions have yet to begin about extending the captain’s present deal, which expires next June.

‘It (the contract) is something we are looking at as a club and with him and how he feels,’ Rodgers said ahead of Wednesday night’s crucial Champions League showdown with Basle. ‘He is still in a real good physical condition. He’s 34 years old, never needs a day’s rest.

‘This is genuine superstar, a world class player who has performed consistently for so many years. This country has not produced too many of them. He will play and prepare himself right the way through to the very end (and when that is we shall see).

‘When he still strikes a ball there are not many like him, both his passing and his shooting; I am certainly enjoying working with him and anyone who works closely with him should. Every football person will know the qualities and influence he still has.’

So here are the questions: What is the delay?

Why have Liverpool not removed from the equation the possibility that, on January 1, Gerrard would be allowed to start speaking to clubs abroad about moving when his deal expires? Never before has he been so close to being a free agent.

There will, ultimately, come a point in the future when Gerrard is no longer the fulcrum of Liverpool’s team but that moment is not at as imminent as some of his critics have suggested during his side’s fragmented start to the campaign.

Yes, there have been some games in which Gerrard has not reached the levels he would expect of himself but he, remember, is the reason Liverpool face Basle with three points rather than one, thanks to his coolly-dispatched last-gasp penalty against Ludogorets.

When Gerrard was last in Liverpool with Basle, in November 2002, he was unceremoniously hauled off at half-time by Gerard Houllier and subjected to caustic criticism from his then manager, who implored that he did not waste his potential.

Gerrard, of course, emerged from the salutatory lesson to become the finest player in Liverpool’s history, a man whose fingerprints are all over the trophies they have won during this century. His influence will always be there – and it needs to be for some time longer.

Rodgers has appreciated everything Gerrard has done for him since he arrived, from the moment he cut short a family holiday to welcome the new manager into his office at Melwood ('He told me he would give me 100 per cent. He lied. He’s given me 200 per cent') to driving last season’s title charge.

The manager knows Gerrard’s importance, as do the supporters. The next move is in the hands of Liverpool’s hierarchy.

Gerrard is an influential player for the Reds and has been an integral part of all the club's wins this century
