Hugh Grant has become a father again for the third time, according to reports.

The 53-year-old actor allegedly welcomed a baby boy into the world in September 2012 following a relationship with Swedish TV producer Anna Elisabet Eberstein.

His arrival was just three months before the birth of his second child with lover Tinglan Hong, son Felix, according to The Sun.

Hugh Grant, 53, is said to have had a son with Swedish TV producer Anna Elisabet Eberstein 16 months ago

A source told the paper: ‘They were pregnant with Hugh’s children at the same time. It’s an unusual arrangement.’

Miss Eberstein is reportedly living with her son in a £3million house near Grant's home in West London

However it is unclear whether Tinglan and Anna were aware of the fact they were both expecting the About A Boy star’s child.

Hugh's involvement with Anna's child was only revealed when his full name - Hugh John Mungo Grant - appeared on the birth certificate after it was re-registered in December 2013.

According to the paper, the space for the father’s name was left blank on the first certificate.

The source told the paper: ‘Anna is 
being supported by Hugh all the way. She lives in a very comfortable 
property in West London and knows that Hugh is there for her.

‘Anna’s parents in Sweden know all about the relationship and she has their blessing.’

Tinglan,
 who is the mother of Hugh’s daughter Tabitha, gave birth to Felix on 
December 29 and registered the new arrival on Valentine’s Day 2013.

According to the birth certificate, Felix Chang was born at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, West London . 

At the time the actor tweeted: ‘In 
answer to some journos. Am thrilled my daughter now has a brother. Adore
 them both to an uncool degree. They have a fab mum.’

He added a short while later: ‘And to be crystal clear. I am the Daddy.’

Felix’s
 arrival came almost 17 months after Miss Hong gave birth to the 
couple’s first child, daughter Tabitha Xaio Xi Hong Grant, at London’s 
Portland Hospital, in September 2011.

In an interview with American chat 
show host Ellen DeGeneres, Grant admitted that while coming as something
 of a shock, fatherhood had had a very positive ‘life-changing’ effect 
on him.

He said: 
‘Everyone was right all these years, saying: “Hugh, why don’t you have 
some children? It changes your life.” Now that I have a child, it is 
life-changing. I recommend it. Get some.

‘I
 can’t pretend it wasn’t a little bit of a surprise. But it’s a very 
nice surprise. In fact, the baby’s name in Chinese, because the mother’s
 is Chinese, means ‘happy surprise’.

Miss Hong, who was born in Zhejiang 
province in eastern China and moved to Britain in 2003, is understood to
 have met Grant in a Chelsea wine bar in 2008.

The pair struck up an unlikely friendship before embarking on a relationship in January 2011.

Tabitha’s
 arrival was kept secret for two months until the actor’s spokesman 
released a statement confirming the birth but adding that Grant – who 
rose to fame in Four Weddings And A Funeral in 1994 – was no longer in a
 relationship with Miss Hong.

It read: ‘I can confirm that Hugh 
Grant is the delighted father of a baby girl. He and the mother had a 
fleeting affair and while this was not planned, Hugh could not be 
happier or more supportive.’

Hugh dated Elizabeth Hurley for 13 years and remains close
to the model  - he is the godfather to
her son Damien.

Following their amicable split he then started dating Jemima Khan for
three years.  He is currently believed to
be single.

A spokesperson for Hugh Grant has been contacted for comment.

Hugh Grant previously dated divorced heiress Jemima Khan for three years,  from 2004 to 2007

Long term love: Hugh was with model/ actress Elizabeth Hurley for 13 years and they remain close
