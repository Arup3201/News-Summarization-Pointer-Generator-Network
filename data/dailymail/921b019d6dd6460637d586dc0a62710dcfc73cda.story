A 73-year-old man has miraculously escaped with cuts and bruises after his light aircraft crashed through the roof of a bungalow in Leicestershire.

The pilot of the small aeroplane had to be freed from the wreckage by emergency crews after his aircraft came down on the farm building outside Castle Bytham, south of Grantham, just after 2pm.

The 61-year-old occupant of the property also escaped unscathed as he was outside the property signing for a delivery from a tanker driver, 52, at the time of the crash. 

Witnesses said the homeowner and the driver 'dived out of the way' as the plane made its crash landing.

The light aircraft crashed through the roof of a bungalow at a farm on the outskirts of Castle Bytham in Leicestershire just after 2pm. The pilot, 73, had to be freed from the wreckage but escaped with bruises

The 61-year-old occupant of the rural farm property also escaped unscathed as he was outside the bungalow signing for a delivery from a tanker driver, 52, at the time of the crash. The delivery driver suffered from shock

Police said the homeowner was uninjured while the delivery driver was taken to hospital with minor cuts and bruises and to be treated for shock.

It is not known at this stage what caused the light aircraft to crash, but an investigation is set to be launched by the Civil Aviation Authority.

A private landing strip situated behind the farm property is often used by civilian light aircraft and it is believed the man may have been doing circuit practice in the area at the time of the crash. 

Police said the pilot, from Thurnby, Leicestershire, had been taken to Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham by air ambulance but confirmed his injuries were non life-threatening. He was freed from the wreckage by fire crews.

Pete Wiles, from Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue, said the homeowner pushed the delivery driver out of the way and to safety after realising the aircraft was making a crash landing.

He said: 'The occupant of the bungalow and a fuel delivery driver were in the garden. They were just finishing off the delivery and noticed the aircraft coming over the hill.

'I understand the occupant pushed the tanker driver out of the way and in doing that he moved out of the way as well.

'In the process of being pushed, the tanker driver sustained a cut to the chin.

'If they hadn't moved... they would have been hit.

'It could have been far more serious than it actually was and there could have been three people killed or seriously injured.'

He added that the trio had a 'fairly miraculous escape', and said the plane narrowly missed an overhead power line nearby.

Chris Wright, a neighbour who lives about one mile away, said he drove past the incident just after it happened.

The self-employed 63-year-old said: 'It landed on the roof and it's just stuck there. Apparently the front wheel went through into the front bedroom.

'I believe he was doing circuit practice at the time, he wasn't able to control it for whatever reason and landed on the roof.

'It's not something you see every day.

'There was obviously a problem but fortunately everyone was OK.'

He said the the homeowner and the delivery driver were chatting outside the property when the plane crashed through the building. 

He said: 'They were talking outside and saw it coming and dived for cover.

'The funny thing was that the oil delivery man was just asking if there were ever any problems with the nearby airfield, and then this happened.

'I saw the plane on the roof of the bungalow and one of the wheels was through the roof and landed on the man's bed.

'I saw both men afterwards and the guy who lives in the bungalow was a bit shaken up, obviously.

The pilot, from Thurnby, Leicestershire, was taken to Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham by air ambulance

'The delivery driver was in the ambulance and had blood on his face. I think he was hurt when the other man pushed him down.

'The pilot was being treated by ambulance men.'

He said the private grass landing strip, about 15-yards from the bungalow, was known locally as Castle Bytham airfield.  

Officers confirmed the bungalow, which is situated on a farm, did not suffer major structural damage but the area has been cordoned off for public safety. 

East Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed an air ambulance, three ambulance and four response paramedics were deployed to the scene. 

Emergency services remain at the scene to ensure the crashed plane and its fuel tank are contained and pose no danger.

The road remains closed at Counthorpe Lane at this time and a full investigation is expected to be carried out to determine the circumstances surrounding the crash.

Anyone with information should contact Lincolnshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 244 of November 19.
