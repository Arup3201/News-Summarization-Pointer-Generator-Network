Juventus midfielder Andrea Pirlo has set his sights on Champions League glory this season as the Turin club looks to regain its place at European football's high table. 

Pirlo has been central to his team's push for a fourth successive Serie A title this term, but the 35-year-old playmaker knows that it is on the continent that Juve must impress to be considered a force again, against the backdrop of Italian football's waning reputation.    

Indeed, with many Italian clubs' star players moving abroad, the division is not as respected as it once was. Juve last won the Champions League in 1996 and last reached the final in 2003, but were eliminated from last year's competition at the group stage.

With Serie A's reputation waning, Juventus will do well to keep hold of star talents such as Paul Pogba

Now, as Paul Pogba and Carlos Tevez are attracting interest from foreign suitors, Pirlo feels that stepping up in the Champions League is the only way for Juve to be considered a powerful force once again and retain their best assets.  

Speaking to La Stampa newspaper ahead of his team's tie with Borussia Dortmund in the competition's last 16, he said, 'I came to Juve in order to win. I am very happy but now we must make the next step up the ladder.' 

'I'd like to win another Champions League before retiring,' added Pirlo who won two Champions League titles with AC Milan in 2003 and 2007.   

Juve manager Massimiliano Allegri meanwhile, recognised Pirlo's unwavering quality despite the midfielder's age. 'He gives the team great shape and, above all, is a point of reference when the team is under pressure,' he said.  

'Andrea has two magic feet. When he strikes with his right foot he gives the ball an incredible flight.'

Tuesday's match in Turin is the first meeting between Juve and Dortmund since the 1997 Champions League final, which the Germans won 3-1.  

Although Dortmund have struggled in the Bundesliga this season, their European form has provided a stark contrast, with Jurgen Klopp's men storming through the group stage with successive wins in their opening four games. 

And Pirlo gave assurances that Juve would not be underestimating the quality of their opposition. 

'We will not fall into the trap of confusing Borussia Dortmund's Bundesliga status with their real quality,' he said.
