When Canada’s Graham DeLaet returned to tour life three months after surgery for a herniated disc, he lasted two tournaments and wasn’t seen again until the following year.

So the understandable exuberance that greeted the stunning announcement last Friday of Tiger Woods’s return from a similar operation, at his own tournament in Washington this week, needs to be tempered with a degree of caution.

Yes, it all looks promising for the 38-year-old to be at The Open at Hoylake next month, where he won in such emotional circumstances in 2006, his first victory following the death of father Earl. But, as DeLaet discovered, there’s a world of difference between the driving range and playing competitively.

Trophy boy: Woods was victorious in Liverpool eight years ago

Taking soundings at the US Open two weeks ago from American reporters who spend their lives writing about Woods, the most optimistic projection for his return was the Bridgestone Invitational, staged in August before the season’s final major, the USPGA Championship.

One close to Woods’ caddie, Joey LaCava, thought we wouldn’t see him again until December.Which just goes to show that, five years after hydrant-gate, even a backstage pass at the Woods travelling circus still offers little insight into what really goes on in the life of the headline act.

Less than a month ago Woods said the recovery process following surgery in March was so slow he wasn’t able to throw a ball with his kids yet. Now he’s teeing it up on the PGA Tour. Is he rushing his return in the hope the entire summer will not prove a washout?

He certainly had good cause to compete at the Quicken Loans National tournament this week, since the sponsor is one of the principal benefactors of the Tiger Woods Foundation.

Woods will give a press conference today in which he will explain his astonishing recovery. And then it will be fingers crossed for when he goes out to play.

Yes, The Open would go on merrily without him at Royal Liverpool. But what a huge shot in the arm it would be to see him back at the venue where, in 2006, he gave perhaps the most brilliant example of course management we have seen in recent times. 

If ever an event summed up a sport’s astonishing transformation, it was the women’s US Open at Pinehurst last week.

Women’s golf was supposed to be beyond the point of no return, dominated by players from the Far East high on quality but low on charisma. Now its higher echelons are dominated by a quorum who look great and play even better.

In the final round on Sunday you had world No 1 Stacy Lewis — who spent seven years of her life wearing a back brace to correct curvature of the spine — posting a 66 to set a target for the long-limbed beauty Michelle Wie.

‘I don’t know what just happened. Birdie the last seven holes? Even saying it sounds crazy.’

No wonder American Kevin Streelman was in shock. Trailing by seven shots, he one-putted each of his last 10 holes and birdied the last seven for a back nine of 28 to win the Travelers Championship in Connecticut by a shot from - it would have to be him, wouldn’t it? - the luckless Sergio Garcia and Korea’s KJ Choi.

How many times have we detailed Wie’s struggles over the years to fulfil her unquestioned talent? This time last year she was an object of ridicule for an outrageous putting style, with her back so parallel to the ground you could serve supper off it.

No wonder the Twitter-sphere exploded with joy when she shrugged off a double bogey at the 16th to birdie the 17th and win her first major at the age of 24 by two  shots. On those upturned saucer greens, she didn’t have a  three-putt all week.

And then there was the lass in third place playing, would you believe, her first event as a pro. Step forward 22-year-old Stephanie Meadow from Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland.

At the 18th hole, she knocked in one more birdie putt from 15 feet to claim a cheque for £170,000 and earn her card for the LPGA Tour in one fell swoop.

What price Northern Ireland having the world No 1 in men’s and women’s golf over the next couple of years?

And who’s Meadow going to play for in the Olympics — that will be the next question. Rio 2016 is going to do fabulous things for women’s golf and Britain and Ireland, with the likes of Meadow and Charley Hull right at the forefront.

The next stop for all these players is the Ricoh British Open at England’s best course, Royal Birkdale, in a fortnight. Let’s hope the summer weather holds.
