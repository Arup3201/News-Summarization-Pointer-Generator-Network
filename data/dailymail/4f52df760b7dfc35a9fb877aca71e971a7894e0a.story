A six-bedroom family home in Birmingham has been reduced to little more than a pile of rubble after the front of the building mysteriously collapsed.

Firefighters were called to the £475,000 detached property on Beak Hill Road in the Kings Norton area of the city at around 4pm yesterday after two bedrooms, the living room and a garage caved in.

Luckily nobody was inside the property at the time of the collapse, although it is understood builders had been carrying out construction work inside the house over the weekend.

Rubble: Nobody was inside the property at the time of the collapse, although it is understood builders had been carrying out construction work inside the house over the weekend

Fear: One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'It was like the world was ending...There was a huge crash and a rumble and then the cloud of dust coated everywhere'

Neighbours spoke of their shock after the building collapsed yesterday afternoon.

Michael Kennedy said he had heard a loud crash and rushed outside to see what had happened.

'All was silent for a second or so and the this massive cloud of dust just floated past the window,' the 68-year-old said.

'We went outside and there we saw that the house three doors down had partially fallen in,' he added.

Risk: West Midlands Fire Service said crews were called out to the property at 4.08pm yesterday. They were still at the scene late last night hoping to secure the house so that an investigation into the collapse can begin

Neighbours have been warned to stay away from their homes overnight due to the risk of subsidence

Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'It was like the world was ending...There was a huge crash and a rumble and then the cloud of dust coated everywhere.'

'I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the mess, that was a really nice part of the house and it's just gone.'

'I'm so glad no one was hurt, a couple and their son live there, but I think they have gone to stay elsewhere for now.'

A spokesman for West Midlands Fire 
Service said: 'Fire crews were called out at 4.08pm and are still at the
 scene and liasing with the builder who was on site.'

'The gas and 
electricity has been isolated and the Technical Rescue Unit is on site 
and is in the process of working with partners to help shore the 
building up.'

Cordoned off: It is believed a family had only recently purchased the property from an elderly couple and that renovation and repair work was ongoing at the site

Desirable: The house was listed on the Zoopla property website in January, described as 'an attractive substantially extended six bedroom detached property of much charm and character'

Firefighters were still on site late last night attempting to secure the property so an investigation can be launched to work out why the front of the building caved in.

Neighbours have been warned to stay away from their homes overnight in case of subsidence.

It is believed a family had only recently purchased the property from an elderly couple and that renovation work was ongoing at the site.

The house was listed on the Zoopla property website in January, priced in the region of £475,000.

It was described as 'an attractive substantially extended six bedroom detached property of much charm and character located in this highly desirable and much sought after residential location.'
