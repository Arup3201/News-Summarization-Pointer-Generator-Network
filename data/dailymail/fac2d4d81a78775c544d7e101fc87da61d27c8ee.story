Barcelona coach Luis Enrique claimed that his players do not argue with referees as much as other teams following his side's 1-0 Copa del Rey  victory over Atletico Madrid.

Lionel Messi gave the Catalans the upper hand heading into the second leg after netting a late winner from a saved penalty at the Nou Camp on Wednesday night.

Despite both Luis Suarez and Javier Mascherano being booked for dissent, Enrique insists that Barcelona 'hardly protest at all' to officials during matches.

Barca head coach Luis Enrique claims his players don't harangue officials like other teams

'In terms of the protests of my players to the referee, if I look at other teams, my players hardly protest at all,' he told reporters after the game. 

'They are very well educated. We could take a look at that aspect but we are by no means the worst. The referees understand that sometimes it is hard to accept an official's decision in the heat of the moment.'

With only a slender one-goal advantage to take to the Vicente Calderon on January 28, Enrique is well aware that the tie is far from over if they are to reach the semi-finals of the competition.

Lionel Messi lost his lunch on the pitch again 

'I see the result as very positive. We knew we had to be very compact and I didn't anticipate a different match because Atletico are a team that defend really well, are very aggressive, very well prepared and that attack you well on dead balls. 

'But with very good circulation of the ball and a very good defensive game, we managed to win.

'I'm very happy with the result, which is fair and allows us to prepare the return with optimism, in the same way we have this one and looking for the victory, although I would like to have won 5-0! 

Messi was spotted vomiting on the pitch, which has has happened a few times to the Argentine this season

Enrique insists he does not have a regular starting line-up but counts on his squad

'The return leg will be very stimulating and we will go there with the idea of creating many chances and not letting our rival create many.

'Knowing the rival and their coach and how they have done in the past few seasons, I still see it at 50 percent, although whatever the result tonight our aim would have been to go to the Calderon and win the game – even though now a draw would be good enough.

'The 44-year-old also admitted that he has not decided on a dedicated starting XI as of yet.

'I don't have a first-choice XI or 10. I have a squad that I like to manage. My idea is to have as many players at my disposition as possible – nothing more, nothing less.'
