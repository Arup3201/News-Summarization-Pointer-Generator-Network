Two criminals have gone on the run from an open prison - meaning four have fled from the same facility in just five days.

Convicted robber Marcus Brotherson, 27, and 24-year-old Jordan Hall, who was jailed for grievous bodily harm, disappeared overnight from HMP Sudbury in Derbyshire.

Two nights earlier Michael Fien McCarthy, 24, who was sentenced to three years for wounding with intent last year, absconded from the category D jail.

On Monday, Andrew David Hudson, 38, who has convictions for burglary and robbery, also disappeared the prison.

It is not known whether the latest prisoners to abscond fled together.

Brotherson has been described by police as black, 5ft 5ins tall and of a stocky build, with short cropped brown hair and brown eyes.

Meanwhile Hall is described as white, 6ft tall and of a slim build, with brown eyes and cropped brown hair.

Their last known addresses were in Birmingham.

Figures reveal the total number of prisoners currently missing from category D HMP Sudbury stands at 28

Figures obtained from police reveal the total number of prisoners currently missing from the jail stands at 28.

This includes a number who have a history of violence, while one is still on the run from the facility more than 20 years after being allowed out in 1992.

The revelations come amid controversy over open prisons after a spate of inmates went on the run.

In the most high-profile case Michael Wheatley, known as the ‘Skullcracker’, carried out a raid on a building society while on the run from HMP Standford Hill in Kent.
