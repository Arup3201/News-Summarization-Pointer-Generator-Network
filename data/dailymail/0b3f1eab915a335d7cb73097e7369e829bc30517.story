Two Second World War Lancaster bombers flew together in the skies over Britain yesterday for the first time in 50 years.

The world's only two airworthy Lancaster bombers were united on a windswept Lincolnshire airfield for what will probably be one of the last times.

The Lancaster Thumper, which is part of the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial flight, joined the Canadian Lancaster Vera from a museum in Ontario.

The two aircraft - pictured at RAF Coningsby - are expected to visit some 60 air shows and public events across the UK over the next five weeks.

The planes had been due to pass over Lincoln Cathedral last Friday, but poor weather caused the flight to be postponed.

MailOnline reported last Saturday on 
how Vera had arrived in Lincolnshire following an epic 3,700-mile 
journey to Britain from her base in Canada.

Aircraft enthusiast Matthew Munson, 
from Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, bid £43,000 on eBay for the 
privilege of flying in the bomber.

Leon Evans, chief pilot for the 
Canadian Lancaster’s historic trip, said: ‘We haven’t had two Lancasters
 fly together in a display before.

‘It’s pretty unlikely it’ll happen 
again because these airplanes might run out of airtime. Vera’s getting 
older and already has about 4,500 hours on her.’

Vera’s journey from Canada took four 
days, involving stops in Newfoundland, Greenland and Iceland before she 
arrived in Lincolnshire on Friday.

More than 7,377 Lancasters, 430 of 
which were built in Canada, were made during the Second World War but 
many that survived were scrapped.

The Avro Lancaster is one of the Second World War's most-recognisable British aircraft.

It is most famous for the Dambusters 
raids, which saw 19 Lancasters attack German dams with Sir Barnes 
Wallis's 'bouncing bombs' in 1943.

Vera - built two years after the raids, in 1945 - was acquired by Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in 1978 and 
underwent a 10-year restoration.

Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson has also been on board the bomber in preparation for a new film about the Dambusters.

On May 16, 1943, 19 aircraft set out 
to destroy three dams in the Ruhr valley - the Mohne, the Eder and the 
Sorpe.

The idea was to damage a vital source of power to the key industrial area of Germany.

The strategic targets not only supplied hydro-electric power, and water for steel-making, but also supplied drinking water.

The squadron was assembled by Wing 
Commander Guy Gibson with only 11 weeks to prepare for their mission - 
using special bouncing bombs, invented by Barnes Wallis.

They were not told that they would be 
bombing the Ruhr valley until six hours before the raid began, following
 weeks of practice over Peak District reservoirs.

On the night of the mission - 
codenamed Operation Chastise - the 113 crewmen took off in three waves 
along two different routes to bomb the dams.

Gibson attacked first at the Möhne at 12.28am, but five bombs were dropped before it was breached.

The first wave’s three remaining aircraft with bombs then attacked the Eder which finally collapsed at 1.52am. Aircraft from the other two waves 
bombed the Sorpe but it remained intact.

Although the mission was hailed
 a success, eight aircraft and 53 crew were lost during the raids.
