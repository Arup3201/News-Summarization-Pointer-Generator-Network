In many ways, Rafaella Kopelan is like any other six-year-old girl - she enjoys playing on swings, riding her bike and 
playing with the family's dog.

But every activity has to be done with extreme care - because her skin could tear at any moment.

Rafaella suffers from the rare condition epidermolysis bullosa - a genetic disorder which can prove fatal.

The incurable condition means her skin blisters constantly - and has caused her fingers to fuse together.

Rafaella Kopelan, six, was born with a rare and incurable genetic condition - called epidermolysis bullosa - which means her skin blisters and tears at the slightest touch

It takes more than 90 minutes to prepare her for the day - starting at 5.15am, all of her bandages have to be changed.

Her parents must also bath her and apply a special cream, as well as cleaning and dressing her wounds which are prone to infection.

The condition has also caused her fingers to become fused together.

But Rafi, who lives in Manhattan, New York, refuses to let her condition slow her down and has even helped raise an incredible $600,000 (£358,000) for charity.

Her father, Brett, Executive Director of the charity Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Research Association (DebRA), had never heard of the disease before she was born.

He said: ‘When Rafi was born she was missing skin on the back of one hand and on both feet. The hospital didn't know what was wrong and after six hours she began to blister.

‘The next morning when I saw her the world fell out from beneath my feet.

‘Doctors started to rule things out and then about nine days later tested for EB.

‘I called my brother who is a physician 
and tried to pronounce the name and he said “oh no” - at that point I 
knew our lives were going to change forever.’

Rafi's parents, Brett and Jackie, have to smother her in special cream and spend hours caring for her wounds

The condition has also caused Rafi's fingers to fuse together and it leaves her in agonising pain

Rafi’s mother, Jackie, had to stop working and her father worked from home for the first three years of her life.

For two years they rented an apartment in Minneapolis, Minnesota, so Rafi could undergo an experimental stem cell transplant which only seven children had undergone before.

Mr Kopelan said: ‘She had a severe case of EB and there was nothing else at that time.

‘Jackie and I knew Rafi might not survive the procedure but we had many factors in our favour.

Epidermolysis
 bullosa is a term used to describe a group of rare, inherited skin 
disorders that cause the skin to become very fragile.

In people with EB, even the gentlest touch can cause painful blisters.

Symptoms
 include blisters inside the mouth, thickened skin and nails, fingers 
and toes becoming joined together, blistering in the oesophagus, chewing
 and swallowing problems, vision problems and skin cancer.

Symptoms are usually present from birth.

EB occurs because of faulty genes inherited from one or both parents and affects about one in every 17,000 children in the UK.

There is currently no cure - treatment aims to relieve symptoms.

The outlook depends a lot on the severity and type of EB a child has.

‘She was young, the disease hadn't progressed to a certain point and we were able to use the cord blood from a German girl who was a good match for her.’

Despite the extremely high risks involved, the transplant allowed Rafi's body to begin producing the protein, Collagen 7, which it could not before.

This protein production meant her condition is slightly less severe, but she still has a bad case of EB.

Doctors are unsure whether her body will ever produce enough of the protein in the future.

Mr Kopelan
 said: ‘EB is like the feeling when you fall off a bike or scrape your 
leg and then get into a shower - how much it hurts when the water and 
soap hit it.

‘If you imagine most of your body as an open wound - we have to hurt our daughter in order to keep her clean and safe.

Rafi underwent pioneering stem cell treatment which improved her condition slightly but it is still severe

‘Every time you approach a child with EB you have to stop and think because everything that is innate about handling a child is now different.

‘You can't lift a child with EB from under the arms to give them a hug as that might rip skin.

‘Truth is, you just can't be rough with a child with EB. You can't run at them and grab them and swing them in the air like you would a healthy child.

‘I think that is where the idea of you can't hug a child with EB came from. Does that make me sad? Yes it does.

‘It makes me sad she can't zoom down a slide for fear that she loses skin on her bottom and then hurts her feet when she hits the ground.

Rafi's father, Brett Kopelan, said: 'EB is like the feeling when you fall off a bike or scrape your leg and then get into a shower - how much it hurts when the water and soap hit it'

‘It makes me sad when my parents go to pick her up and they don't always think not to lift her up the way they do their other grandchildren.

‘Rafi can't do the things or experience some things that other children can and that makes me very sad. It's impossible to know what she goes through.

‘Whenever you physically interact with Rafi, or any child with EB for that matter, it is better to breathe first, think second and then act accordingly.’

In 2012, the family set up 'Rafi's Run' - an annual 5km fun run in New York which raises money for research into a cure.

She attends a local school in Manhattan and her father said she is very mature about the disease.

Mr Kopelan said: 'There is no one I admire more in this world than my daughter'

Her father added: ‘There was a time when Rafi said having EB made her unique, which was an incredibly mature thought pattern for a five-year-old.

‘I couldn't be more proud - but, the truth is she hates having EB and I can't blame her.

‘I keep telling her about the different medicines being developed to help her and she is excited about the possibility of beating her EB.

‘It's not fair she has to go through everything that she does, but she handles it with a grace and courage that I know I couldn't muster.

‘There is no one I admire more in this world than my daughter.’
