A jealous RAC man who was jailed for 
beating up a colleague he saw canoodling with his wife has been freed on
appeal - after she belatedly confessed to the affair.

Chris Van Niekerk, 35, said he 
attacked his close friend Neil Child after spotting him cavorting with 
his wife Lindsay through a window at the family home in Hampshire.

Mr Child denied the accusation, 
insisting his friend got the wrong end of the stick and that he and 
Lindsay had accidentally 'fallen' onto a bed while he comforted her.

A crown court judge did not believe 
Van Niekerk’s story and sentenced him in August to 15 months’ jail on 
the basis that he was not provoked by any sexual relations between his 
friend and wife.

But it has now emerged that Lindsay 
has owned up to the affair, leading to three senior judges at the Court 
of Appeal releasing Van Niekerk on a suspended sentence.

Delighted Van Niekerk left the London court a free man, accompanied by a large group of family and friends.

'It is plain that the story about 
falling accidentally onto the bed simply was untrue,' said Mr Justice 
Collins, who heard the appeal with Lord Justice Moore-Bick and Judge 
Nicholas Cooke QC.

'We have seen a statement from his wife,' he continued.

'She recognises she had been having 
the affair and she recognises that that created the situation which led 
her husband to act entirely out of character and assault Mr Child in the
way that he did.

'She feels still some responsibility 
for what happened and, indeed, she is punishing herself following his 
imprisonment for what happened.'

The court heard that Van Niekerk and 
his wife had been on a trial separation and living apart when he went 
round to the matrimonial home about midnight on March 16.

He said he looked through the window 
and flew into a rage when he spotted his RAC workmate and good friend, 
Mr Child, having 'sexual relations' with Lindsay on the bed.

Winchester Crown Court Judge Keith Cutler initially rejected Van Niekerk's account of what happened

The South African, of 
Sherfield-on-Loddon, near Basingstoke, attacked Mr Child in the house, 
punching him. He continued outside, pulling his victim from his van, 
wrestling him to the ground and punching him again.

Mr Child denied the affair, saying he 
was only at the house to pick up a birthday present Lindsay had for him.
She had become upset and they fell onto the bed together when he tried 
to comfort her.

At the crown court, Judge Keith Cutler
rejected Van Niekerk’s account of what happened, saying he had not 
claimed to have seen any sexual activity when police first questioned 
him.

But, at the Court of Appeal, lawyers 
for the father-of-three said Lindsay had now confirmed that she had been 
having an affair with Mr Child, which caused her husband to flip.

The crown court judge had also been 
wrongly informed about Mr Child’s injuries, which, although serious, 
were not as bad as he had been told, the three judges heard.

Allowing the appeal, Mr Justice 
Collins said the judge should not have rejected Van Niekerk’s account of
rumbling the affair without giving him a chance to explain himself 
properly in court.

Van Niekerk, who got 15 months for 
causing GBH at Winchester Crown Court, walked free from the London court
after having his sentence cut to six months and suspended for a year. 
He is to go to live with a friend in Basingstoke and is banned from 
going to Mr Child’s house.

Mr Justice Collins said: 'It has 
undoubtedly, the whole situation, had a very dire effect upon his family
and he has taken very hard the fact of imprisonment.'
