It was originally meant to be Kanye West.

George Zimmerman, the man acquitted of the shooting death of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2013, said he wanted to fight the hip hop superstar because he 'constantly attacks innocent people'.

But now, as the 30-year-old painter continues to try and extend his 15 minutes of infamy, Zimmerman has been confirmed to go fist-to-fist with rapper DMX.

The two will compete in a 'celebrity boxing match', according to TMZ, which bizarrely was all Zimmerman's idea.

'I am breaking every rule in boxing': Rapper DMX, 43, has confirmed he will fight George Zimmerman in a 'celebrity boxing match'

George Zimmerman, 30, was found not guilty of all charges levied against him after he fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin during a fight in February 2012 inside a gated community in Sanford, Florida

DMX - real name Earl Simmons - was arrested on August 20, 2013, in South Carolina for driving under a suspended license and marijuana possession

Boxing promoter Damon Feldman confirmed the fight and said DMX was selected out of more than 15,000 applicants.

The 43-year-old rap star and actor said he plans to break every rule in boxing 'to make sure I f--k him right up'.

He also threatened to urinate in his opponent’s face if he won.

'I will beat the living f--k out of him,' DMX told TMZ.

The boxing match will last for three rounds.

An exact date, time and location for the fight will be announced at a news conference next Wednesday.

All the proceeds Zimmerman earns from the fight will go to charity, Feldman said.

Zimmerman has been in boxing training for months in preparation for the fight.

It was his idea to stage a boxing match.

Trayvon Martin, 17, was fatally shot by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, in Sanford, Florida, on February 26, 2012. Zimmerman is now taking part in a 'celebrity boxing match'

'It was my idea,' Zimmerman said in an interview with Radar Online.

'Prior to the incident I was actually going to the gym for weight loss and doing boxing-type training for weight loss and a mutual friend put me in contact with Damon and provided me with an opportunity and motivation to get back in shape and continue with my weight loss goals and also be able to help a charity out,' he said.

'Boxing isn’t new to me.

'It’s something I had picked up well before the incident and it’s something that I liked, I enjoyed, and I kept up with it and I was able to lose a tremendous amount of weight and get a healthy lifestyle.'

'So it’s not a new hobby, it’s something I have been doing and wanting to pursue to maintain a healthy lifestyle.'

In a strange coincidence, today would have been Trayvon Martin's 19th birthday.

Zimmerman was found not guilty of all charges levied against him, after he fatally shot the teen during a fight in February 2012 inside a gated community in Sanford, Florida.

The Hispanic man claimed that he had killed Martin with a weapon in an act of self-defence.

George Zimmerman initially set his aim for Kanye West, saying he should take part in a fight because he constantly attacks people

Zimmerman remained without charge for 44 days after the shooting occurred, which led to nationwide protests and sparked furious debate over racial profiling and the right to use weapons in self-defence.

Further demonstrations broke out after Zimmerman was acquitted in 2013.

Federal authorities are currently reviewing the entire case to decide whether Martin’s civil rights were violated.

Rapper The Game, who has a tattoo of Trayvon Martin on his leg, had previously registered his interest to challenge Zimmerman in a fight.

'I would not be boxing for me,' The Game told TMZ. 

'I'd be boxing for the legacy of Trayvon Martin and for his family.

'I would box him to knock him out.

'I would definitely take pleasure in it. 

'It's legal, and I want to show him you can solve your disputes without a weapon.'
