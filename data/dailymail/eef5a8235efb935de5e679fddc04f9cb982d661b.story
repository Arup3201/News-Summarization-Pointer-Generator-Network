Ukip is preparing for a ‘vicious, insulting and borderline libelous’ attacks from the Labour party in the run-up to the European elections, Nigel Farage revealed today.

The Ukip leader said he now expects to make the biggest electoral gains in Labour’s industrial heartlands, when he predicts an onslaught from Ed Miliband’s party.

It comes after Labour revealed it has hired a dedicated official to monitor Ukip’s activities.

A new YouGov poll today puts Ukip on 10 per cent. It includes 13 per cent of people who voted Tory in 2010, 10 per cent of Lib Dems and 4 per cent of Labour supporters at the last general elections.

Labour and Ukip are to go head-to-head in the battle to come first in the European elections on May 22. The Tories are widely expected to come third.

Mr Farage told MailOnline he is prepared for a panicked Labour party to descend into dirty politics.

‘The untold story of British politics is that we are hammering working class votes and the Labour party has only just begun to wake up to it,’ Mr Farage said.

Labour's Douglas Alexander said the party did not underestimate the threat posed by Ukip

‘We are now the working class party. The upside potential for Ukip now comes more from Labour than anywhere.’

He said he would be focussing resources and campaign spending on the Midlands and northern seats where Labour dominates.

‘They will be vicious, insulting and much of what they say will border on libellous. They will have they trade union bully-boy friends helping them. They have got unite against fascism groups lobbying outside our meetings.

‘We know all too well how the Labour party will behave.’

It comes as Labour  revealed it has dedicated staff working on countering the threat from Ukip.

Douglas Alexander, the party’s election –co-rindator and shadow foreign secretary,  said: ‘I take Ukip very seriously. The truth is that Ukip presents an electoral challenge to all political parties.

‘The way to defeat Ukip is not to be a better Ukip but to be a better Labour Party,’ he told The Independent.

‘That means making sure the EU works better for Britain but also tackling the cost of living crisis, promoting jobs and growth and protecting the NHS.

‘We have got staff dedicated to exposing the gap between the rhetoric of Ukip and its record. Inevitably, Ukip’s policies will come under sustained scrutiny in the weeks and months ahead.’

UKIP Director of Communications Patrick O'Flynn: 'Labour has finally woken up to the fact that the UKIP message is resonating in working class communities.

'Ordinary working families increasingly realise that the Labour Party no longer stands up for their interests and that only UKIP offers a solution to the uncontrolled immigration that is compressing wages and placing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services.'
