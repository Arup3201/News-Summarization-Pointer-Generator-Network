A drunk British man who was arrested on a Cuba-bound Thomas Cook flight after threatening cabin crew and passengers was on his honeymoon, it has emerged.

The man, named as Mohammed Khelya, from Blackburn, Lancashire,  threatened to kill cabin crew members and passengers. He was so unruly that he forced the plane to divert to Bermuda and was escorted off it by police - with his wife continuing on to Cuba without him.

Khelya had been drinking from a bottle of duty-free vodka before quarreling with his wife when he was taken in handcuffs to the rear of the aircraft and forced its unscheduled landing, prosecutors said.

Diversion: The man, named as Mohammed Khelya, from Blackburn, Lancashire, became so unruly that he forced the plane to change course and land at Bermuda

Appearing on Tuesday at a court in Hamilton, Bermuda's
capital, a contrite Khelya pleaded guilty to being drunk on the
aircraft and to threatening flight staff.

'I don't know how I'm going to forgive myself,' he said in
court.

'I don't know how she's going to forgive me,' he added,
referring to his wife.

Khelya, 22, and his wife were among 311 passengers on board
a Thomas Cook flight, which set out from Manchester
International Airport.

Several hours into the flight, after his wife changed seats
to get away from him, Khelya appealed unsuccessfully to a crew
member to see her.

'I'm going to kill you and I'm going to kill everyone
after,' Khelya told a crew member, using an expletive, according
to prosecutors.

When asked to stop drinking, he replied: 'So what if I f*****g am?'

As flight attendants moved a handcuffed Khelya to the back
of the plane, he spat at other passengers, compelling crew
members to use blankets to protect them, prosecutors said.

He further panicked passengers by taking pictures of the inside of the cabin despite being told it was against flight regulations.

Diverted to the L.F. Wade International Airport, the flight
was greeted by police officers, who escorted Khelya off the
plane.

On Tuesday, Magistrate Khamisi Tokunbo fined Khelya $2,000 (£1275) for being drunk on the aircraft and another $1,000 (£650)for his
abusive behavior towards flight staff. If Khelya fails to pay
the fines, he faces four months in a Bermuda jail.

An attorney for Khelya could not immediately be reached for
comment.

Newly weds: The man was on board a plane operated by Thomas Cook (file photo)

The Thomas Cook flight left Manchester at 10.30am on Monday and was forced to stop in Bermuda at about 6pm.

Video footage, taken from http://bernews.com, shows the man dressed in a white T-shirt and appearing to cover his face as he is led off the plane by three police officers. 

A Thomas Cook spokesman said yesterday: 'Thomas Cook Airlines can confirm that flight TCX244 from Manchester to Holguin, Cuba, diverted to Bermuda and a customer was removed from the aircraft and detained by local police. 

'We operate a zero-tolerance policy towards any behaviour on board our aircraft that affects the safety and welfare of our customers and crew.

'We'd like to thank those customers continuing to Cuba for their patience during the short delay in Bermuda.'

The Airbus A330 was on the ground on the North American island for around three hours before returning to the skies to complete its journey to Holguin in Cuba.  

A police spokesman said yesterday: 'It appears that the unruly passenger was on board creating a major commotion. The 25 year old man assaulted flight attendants and threatened to harm persons onboard the plane after he apparently consumed too much of alcohol.

'The man was forcibly taken to the rear of the aircraft where he was restrained until the flight landed in Bermuda. He then promptly arrested and taken to Hamilton Police Station where he was processed and detained.'
