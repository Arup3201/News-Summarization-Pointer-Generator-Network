Police believe they have identified a man's body dumped in pieces in a Melbourne river after a family member recognised a distinctive tattoo.

DNA tests will be used to confirm the identity of the victim, who police say may be a man in his late 30s who lived on the fringe of the Melbourne CBD. 

It comes after severed arm with a red devil tattoo was spotted in the Maribyrnong River near the Boathouse restaurant on Thursday, while other remains were found further upstream.

Divers are still scouring the river after more body parts were discovered by a member of the public, who found two severed limbs and a plastic bag of flesh at about 11am on Saturday.

Homicide Squad Detective Inspector Mick Hughes said a close relative of the suspected victim came forward after police released images of a red devil tattoo found on the forearm.

'It's a tragic way for the family to find out but it has progressed our investigation,' Det Insp Hughes said.

Police won't release the name of the victim until he is formally identified through DNA testing, which is expected to take several days.

'We will release it as soon as we are able because clearly again we want to know his associates and how they may be able to help us,' Det Insp Hughes said.

It's believed the man was not known to police.

He had not been in contact with his family since Christmas but police say that was not unusual and he was not listed as a missing person.

Det Insp Hughes said the tidal nature of the river made the search for body parts difficult.

He said police were still expecting to find more body parts and any member of the public who come across them should contact officers.

'We've done the best we can on the ground and we'll continue to do that,' he said.

'Certainly if someone sees something we'll have a team respond.'

The first body parts were discovered by a runner, while a rower discovered more on Sunday.

Det Insp Hughes confirmed some of the body parts had been found in plastic but said appeared they had not been weighed down.

Investigations into the man's associates will begin once he has been formally identified.

Detectives continued searching the river by boat on Friday morning and will focus on a bridge about two kilometres from the restaurant where the forearm was spotted

Detectives believe the latest find is linked to the other male remains found so far.

A severed arm with a red devil tattoo was spotted near the Boathouse restaurant on Thursday, while the other remains were found further upstream.

The part found on Saturday was near Oakland Street, which is about 1km away from the restaurant.

Water police revisited the river on Saturday morning and remain at the scene.

Police released the image of the tattoo after a forearm was spotted floating by diners at a nearby restaurant on Thursday afternoon.

Part of a limb and a black plastic bag of human flesh were found further upstream when police divers searched the area. 

A Victoria Police spokesman says police have received a number of calls offering information, and detectives are working through them.
