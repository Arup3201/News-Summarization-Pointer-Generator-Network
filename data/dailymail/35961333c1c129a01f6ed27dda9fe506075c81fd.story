Supermarkets seem to be deliberately organised to make it as hard as possible to find what you’re looking for.

To solve this problem, Dutch-based firm Philips is trialling a system that creates a GPS-style grid on a smartphone or tablet, and can be used by customers to plan their route around individual stores.

Shoppers input ingredients from a recipe, or food items from their weekly shopping list, and the app will plot the best route to take as well as highlight the exact location of each item.

Philips is trialling a system that connects smart lighting in supermarkets, stock image pictured, to an app. This creates a GPS-style grid on a smartphone. Shoppers input ingredients from a recipe and the app will plot the best route to take as well as highlight the locations of each item

When a customer enters a supermarket and opens the dedicated smartphone app, a positioning grid appears onscreen.

This
tells the user the route they need to take to get everything on 
their shopping list - either from recipes or other lists.

The system works by using a network of ‘intelligent LED in-store lights’ that act as a GPS-style grid.

Each light is plotted on the grid and can send its position to the app.

As customers move around the store, relevant discounts and offers also appear for nearby products.

Similarly,
 if someone is looking for generic ‘dessert’ ideas, the app can guide 
them top the pastry section and offer suggestions.

As they move around the store, the app shows relevant discounts and offers for nearby products, and can even offer suggestions for alternative products if the ones the customer wants have sold out.

When a customer enters a supermarket and opens the dedicated smartphone app, this positioning grid appears onscreen.

It tells the user the route they need to take to get everything on their shopping list and the shopper can follow the map in a similar way to how they would follow a satnav.

Alternatively, if someone is looking for generic ‘dessert’ ideas, the app can guide them to the pastry section and offer suggestions of meals to make.

This infographic explains how Philips' smart lighting system works. If a shopper plans to make Mexican dinner, the app guides them to the aisle where they will find guacamole. Alternatively, if they want to make it fresh, the app guides them through the aisles to avocados, tomatoes, onions, chilies and limes

As customers move around the store, relevant discounts and offers will appear for nearby products, pictured in the illustration left. The app can also make suggestions for alternate recipes or desserts, illustrated right

For example, if a shopper plans to make Mexican food for dinner, the app works like a ‘personal shopper.’ 

It
guides the shopper to the aisle where they will find a jar of 
guacamole. Alternatively, if they want to make it fresh, the app plots a route through 
the aisles to the avocados, tomatoes, onions, chilies and limes. 

As 
the shopper approaches various products, the app can introduce 
new brands available in the store, or make suggestions for alternate 
recipes.

The lighting system is currently being piloted with select retailers and is on display at trade show Euroshop in Düsseldorf.

‘The beauty of the system is that retailers do not have to invest in additional infrastructure to house, power and support location beacons for indoor positioning,’ said Gerben van der Lugt from Philips Lighting.

‘The light fixtures themselves can communicate this information by virtue of their presence everywhere in the store.
