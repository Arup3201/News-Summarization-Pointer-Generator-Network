Concrete evidence for the existence of Bigfoot has so far failed to materialise, but a man who’s spent 37 years hunting the beast hopes to change all that by funding expeditions using money from an initial public offering (IPO).

Carmine ‘Tom’ Biscardi, from Las Vegas, hopes to raise $3million by selling stock in Bigfoot Project Investments.

This money will be funnelled into making DVDS, but a large slice - $113,805 a year – will be used to fund Bigfoot-finding missions.

‘Capture the creature known as Bigfoot’ is listed as a company priority on documents filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), according to The Wall Street Journal.

Many are likely to consider this plan unrealistic, but it certainly won’t stop the IPO going ahead.

The SEC has said in the past that it ‘does not evaluate the merits of any IPO or determine whether an investment is appropriate for any investor’.

Biscardi told 2014 BBC documentary Shooting Bigfoot: ‘I've seen the creature with my own eyes. I was 12ft away from one once and I freaked out. I made a dedication to myself that day that I'm going to bring one of these things back because I know they exist. 37 years later, I'm still doing it.'

Quite what Mrs Biscardi makes of it all is anyone's guess, although his son TJ has been known to team up with his father and his crack 'A-team' of Bigfoot hunters.

Travelling with TJ and Tom is Young Blood, described by Biscardi as his 'chief tracker and sharpshooter' and Chico, an elderly survival specialist.

When Biscardi isn't out hunting for Bigfoot, he's busy making documentaries; among them Bigfoot Lives, Bigfoot Lives 2 and Bigfoot Lives 3.

It might sound bizarre but Biscardi is convinced he knows what he's doing. 'You hear about people saying they're a Bigfoot hunter, Bigfoot researcher, Bigfoot this and that, crypto zoologist,' he complains.

'Crypto my ass - the name of the game is this: you either heel and toe it down that street and go out into the brush and look or you'll never find anything.'

10: The photographic and video evidence is awful: Besides the famed 1968 Patterson Gimlin video that purports to show bigfoot walking all footage is grainy and photographs blurred. We wonder why?

9: Bigfoot fails to fit into the food chain in North America: The beast is supposed to be 9ft tall and weigh 600 pounds. That would mean it would need to eat 5,000 calories a day to survive - which would lead to a huge unexplained dent in the natural food chain. Scientists have said they have never detected a gap this size before.

8: Bigfoot is just too big: Logically, a 600-pound, 9ft tall ape-man would not go unnoticed by people not even on the trail of the Bigfoot. Basically, if the creature did exist, we would have found it by now.

7: There is no fossil or bone record: A creature this big would have left bones or fossil records behind. However, never once have any ape-like creature's remains or bones been found.

6: Breeding is impossible: If bigfoot is an ape, it would live a longer lifespan than other mammals in North America and the population would run into the thousands. Apes are not solitary creatures - unlike how all Bigfoots are presented.

5: Wrongly identified: Most experts point out that the majority of Bigfoot sightings could simply be black or brown bears walking on their hind-legs.

4: Explosion in sightings after the Bluff Creek Discovery of 1958: Like Roswell in 1947 can be seen as year dot for UFO sightings, so the discovery of several large footprints in 1958 at Bluff Creek in California can be said to have started the Bigfoot phenomenon. After that there were a spate of sightings which haven't stopped to this day.

3: Lack of a body: There is a long standing $1,000,000 reward for the body of sasquatch.

2: Hoaxes: But exactly because of the immense financial rewards should a hunter be proved correct, people try to seek fame and fortune with fake Bigfoots.

1: No evidence: If Bigfoot exists, all scientists need is one strand of hair to determine through DNA that a new ape-like creature has been identified. That has not happened.
