Beaming with pride after one of the performances of his life, this is the moment magic Mo Farah celebrated 10,000m gold with a hug from his pregnant wife and seven-year-old daughter.

Capping Britain's most successful Olympic day in over a century, Farah hugged wife Tania and his young stepdaughter Rhianna, who had joined him trackside after the dramatic win.

In a stunning display of tenacity, talent and speed, Farah beat Kenenisa Bekele, the Ethiopian 5,000m and 10,000m World and Olympic record holder, to claim Olympic gold in front of an 80,000 home crowd and millions of fans watching on television.

Farah, 29, collapsed to the floor after powering across the line, overcome with joy.

He went on to describe the gold-winning race as 'the best moment of my life', adding that 'it's never going to get any better than this.'

The capacity, partisan crowd in the Olympic Stadium, along with millions watching on TV, would have been moved almost to tears as Farah's stepdaughter Rhianna ran on to the track clutching a Union Jack to embrace the Olympic champion.

Unbeatable: Farah's gold completed a memorable 45 minutes for British athletics following the wins of Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford

Farah sealed his status as one of the stars of British athletics in front of 80,000 spectators in the Olympic Stadium.

It was a sign of his talent that even
the Ethiopians and the Kenyans, who dominate track and field middle 
distance running, had known that he was one of the ones to watch.

World
5,000m champion Farah had thought his race would not come down to the 
last lap as his rivals feared his sprinting speed, but in the end that 
was what happened and Farah hit the front at the bell to time his finish
to perfection.

After the 
race, Farah said: 'I've never experienced something like this, it 
doesn't come around that often and to have it on your doorstep with that
amount of people supporting you and shouting your name....it's never 
gonna get any better than this,' Farah said.

'This is the best moment of my life.

'It's
something that I've worked so hard for. It's just the grinding and hard
work and 120 miles a week, week in, week out and long distance events 
and what you put into it is what you get out.

'I
want to thank everyone who has supported me from my childhood until 
now. Without all those people that wouldn't have happened and I've just 
got to enjoy this moment I guess.'

The
gutsy Somali-born athlete, who coined the motto 'Go Hard or Go Home', 
has clearly more than stepped it up a gear since a disappointing Olympic
debut in Beijing 2008 when he failed to reach the 5,000m final.

Back in June Farah insisted he could still improve despite becoming the first man to retain the 5,000m title in the history of the European Championships.

The packed stadium was already buzzing from Jessica Ennis's gold in the heptathlon and a surprise victory from Greg Rutherford in the long jump at the Olympic Stadium.

London 2012 chairman Lord Coe was with Prime Minister David Cameron in the Olympic Stadium among the packed crowd cheering his fellow Sheffield athlete to victory.

He said Ennis was 'absolutely sensational' adding: 'Faultless throughout. Jess has nerves of steel and she has delivered a massive British moment which will inspire for generations to come.'

Of Rutherford's victory, he said: 'A wonderful achievement. Greg is always capable on his day of beating the best. I am so delighted he chose London as one of his days.

Farah spends most of his time in the United States where he has been able to train away from the spotlight.

In the big competitions, the Ethiopians have the advantage of working as a team against him.Farah spent most of his early life in Djibouti and arrived in London when he was eight to join his father.

He grew up in Hanworth, west London.

Farah's story from the poverty-stricken streets of Somalia to top flight athletics is one that serves as an inspiration, both in Britain and his place of birth.

His charity - the Mo Farah Foundation - is helping to provide life-saving aid to some of the millions of people facing starvation and disease in East Africa.

Strong home support is key.

Farah currently lives in Portland, Oregon, with his wife and daughter.

He is coached by Alberto Salazar and runs for the Nike Oregon Project.

Aside from athletics, Farah's other sporting passion is Arsenal football club.

He has been an Arsenal fan from a young age - even though his father was a massive Manchester United fan.

Farah notes: 'I'm not as quick as Theo Walcott but I've got endurance.'

As with most British athletes competing in a home Games is something special.

He said ahead of London 2012: 'I always wanted to be Olympic and World champion so having the Games in London is a massive bonus.

'If it comes down to the last 100m and people are shouting your name, it's going to give you that extra boost.'
