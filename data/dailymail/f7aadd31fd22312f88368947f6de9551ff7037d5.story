Malakai Fekitoa crossed three seconds from full time and Colin Slade converted to give the New Zealand All Blacks a 29-28 win in the last Bledisloe Cup test of the series on Saturday, inflicting more pain on the embattled Wallabies.

New Zealand had already retained the Bledisloe Cup with a thumping 51-20 win in Auckland following the 12-12 draw in Sydney at the start of the Rugby Championship, but was behind for most of the match in Brisbane and were on the cusp of losing back-to-back tests for the first time in three years.

Half-time: 15-12

Australia had 10-point cushions twice - and had a one-man advantage for 10 minutes in the second half when Patrick Tuipulotu was in the sin bin - but couldn't sustain it.

The Australians led 15-12 at the break after a see-sawing half featuring two tries for each team.

The Wallabies scored in the 12th and the 39th minutes, with halves Nick Phipps and Bernard Foley darting over from the back of rucks on the tryline.

The All Blacks responded immediately to the first try, regaining possession from the kick restart and spreading it right for Corey Jane, who slid over inside the post to level the scores.

After turning down three shots at goal, Foley landed a penalty to give the Australians a 10-7 lead in the 32nd but it only took three minutes for the All Blacks to hit the front for the first time when hooker Dane Coles embarrassed the defense by throwing a dummy near the left sideline in the attacking quarter and angling back infield to score untouched.

The lead changed hands again just before the break when the Australians, after a series of one out hitups, went to the left corner where Hooper drew in the two outside defenders and went to ground a meter out, allowing Foley to reach out for the try.

Ashley-Cooper crossed just after halftime in his milestone 100th test, giving the hosts a 22-12 lead after some sustained attack and a strong, bumping run from Tevita Kuridrani.

Beauden Barrett and Foley traded penalties to make it 25-15 in the 58th before Tuipulotu was sin-binned for dangerous tackle on a player in the air, taking out Wallabies lock Rob Simmons as he jumped to take the kick restart.

Then the experience of the No. 1-ranked All Blacks kicked in, playing for field position and pressuring the fatiguing Australian defense.

Scrumhalf Aaron Smith scored from a close-range quick tap after sustained All Blacks pressure in the 68th minute and Barrett converted to make it 25-22.

Replacement scrumhalf Nic White kicked a long-range penalty goal to give the Australians a six-point lead which appeared to be enough until the last minute when center Fekitoa sliced through the stretched defense in midfield and dived over on the right. Replacement Slade had no difficulty with the conversion, capping another successful southern winter for the All Blacks.

Both teams head to Europe for tours, with Australia unsure about the makeup of its squad. Beale is likely to be heavily sanctioned after a tribunal hearing this week, and McKenzie is also under scrutiny after yet another Wallabies defeat, albeit narrow. 

Australia: Folau, Ashley-Cooper, Kuridrani, LealiIfano, Tomane, Foley, Phipps, Slipper, Faingaa, Kepu, Carter, Simmons, Fardy, Hooper, Higginbotham.

Replacements: White for Phipps (54), Robinson for Slipper (67), Mann-Rea for Faingaa (74), Alexander for Kepu (65), Horwill for Carter (65), Hodgson for Higginbotham (60).

Not Used: Cooper, Horne.

New Zealand: Dagg, Jane, C. Smith, Fekitoa, Savea, Barrett, A. Smith, Crockett, Coles, O. Franks, Retallick, Whitelock, Messam, McCaw, Read.
