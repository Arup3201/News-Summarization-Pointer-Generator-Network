A shopper shared her disgust when she saw a magpie that appeared to be nibbling on pre-packed meat at a Tesco supermarket. 

Raquel Burchell spotted the bird perched on the edge of a shelf full of pre-packaged raw meat at a Tesco store in Havant, Hampshire, and took a photo as it seemed to start pecking at the food.

Ms Burchell posted a picture of the 'horrible' incident of the magpie perched on the beef mince section of the supermarket, on her Twitter account.

'It was disgusting. Its beak was in the packets eating raw meat,' she told the BBC. 

'It was horrible.'

Ms Burchell posted the offended pictures earlier today with the message: 'Magpie at Tesco eating the food contaminating the food discontinuing.' [sic]

All items the bird came into contact with have now been removed from the shop floor and from sale.

The supermarket giant responded to Ms Burchell and said they maintained high levels of hygiene in their shops.

In a statement Tesco said: 'Hi Raquel, rest assured, our goal is always to release any birds which have found their way into our stores.

'We also ensure we maintain our high standards of hygiene at all times.' 

Tesco said the bird was released after being discovered and it maintained hygiene standards in all stores

Ms Burchell posted the comment on Twitter today, claiming the magpie was eating the pre packed meat

A spokesman for Tesco said: 'We are pleased to confirm that the bird was safely released from the store this morning.' 

Magpies are natural scavengers, predators and destroyers of pests, and will often nest close to towns and cities because they are warmer. 

The RSPB estimates there are more than a million of the birds in the UK.
