A sci-fi obsessed couple who stole £2.3million and spent huge sums on memorabilia in an 'orgy of greed and self-indulgence' will have their much-loved collectables auctioned today.

Spendaholic Julie Nickerson, 55, from West Yorkshire, was jailed for five years after she splashed£500,000 on a house, £200,000 on holidays and even £16,000 on Star Trek costumes.

Similar amounts were also spent on Darth Vader's helmet, a mint condition Millennium Falcon model, remote controlled daleks and hundreds of other items due to be sold by police today.

Her newsagent husband Anthony, 48, jailed for two-and-a-half years, would was called Britain's best kept paper boy because he would deliver the papers in his £50,000 Mercedes.

His role was funnelling the millions his wife stole from her laundry company employer through his business.

Sci-fi gold: This mint condition replica Millennium Falcon was one of more than 1,000 items bought by a couple later jailed for their part in a £2.3million theft

Today 1,000 rare pieces of sci-fi memorabilia they bought only to be seized by police will be auctioned.

Actual costumes used in the Star Trek films, including Scotty's jacket, a replica Millennium falcon from Star Wars and remote control Daleks are among the lots in the unusual collection.

On instructions from West Yorkshire Police, Wilsons Auctions in Northern Ireland is putting the collection up for sale with no reserve price on any of the items.

Aidan Larkin, assets recovery manager at Wilsons, said the auction presented a 'once in a lifetime' opportunity for sci-fi fans.

'These items come round very, very rarely,' he said.

'It's rare for such a large, significant 
collection of these items to become available. Normally at the 
specialist toy auctions there are one or two items of a certain range - 
we have complete waves of toys that were produced.'

The Nickersons, pictured outside court, spent the cash on lavish luxury holidays, a house worth half a million pounds a fleet of Mercedes cars and also memorabilia

Mr Larkin, who said he expected a lot of on-line bids from the United States, said the set of six Star Trek costumes were probably the most valuable items for sale.

'We have been informed when the costumes last changed hands in Christie's Auctions in New York a few years ago the couple in question spent $27,000 (£15,800) on these costumes,' he said.

The auction gets under way at 6.30pm in Wilsons' headquarters in Mallusk in north Belfast. 

The diverse and valuable haul was once owned by a husband and wife who build it up using their ill gotten gains.

The Nickersons spent the cash on lavish luxury holidays, a house worth half a million pounds which came complete with five acres of land, a hot spring and swimming pool and a fleet of Mercedes cars.

They also splashed £17,000 on film memorabilia from Christie’s Auction House in London and spent a further £10,000 on motorsport events at Silverstone.

In May Mr Nickerson admitted transferring and concealing just under £925,000 between July 2009 and December 2012, while in December last year, his wife pleaded guilty to stealing £2.3million from JLA Ltd between 2005 and December 2012 after she was made redundant.

Mrs Nickerson, who worked in the accounts and finance department at the firm in Halifax, stole the cash over a seven-year period beginning in 2005.

She also admitted money laundering and fraud in relation to a fallse representation made to HM Revenue and Customs.

The court heard her husband turned a blind eye to his wife’s dishonesty, and was told by the judge ‘you helped her’ with a theft ‘in breach of trust’.

Recorder Anthony Hawks told Mrs Nickerson, who sobbed as the sentence was read out: ‘You have taken in excess of £2million. You and your husband didn’t need that money.

‘There was no pressing need for the money for an operation or a sick family member. You were comfortably off.

‘What you did was to embark on an orgy of greed and self-indulgence which only came to a head when you were made redundant.

‘You lived a lavish lifestyle. You took holidays that other people could only dream of. You spent thousands of pounds of sports memorabilia. You bought expensive vehicles. The list goes on'.
