Scotland boss Gordon Strachan barks instructions to Darren Fletcher pitch side at Celtic Park

Strachan admitted England outclassed Scotland, with Wayne Rooney fending off pressure from Fletcher

‘We thought they would sit and wait. They are a team full of Champions League players. We were mentally fatigued from Friday.

‘The team that pressurised better was England, the team that played better was England.

‘This was a good England team. To beat them we would have had to have ten out of 11 players playing well.

‘It was a one off game tonight and the priority was the Republic. But to deal with this game is difficult and we have to deal with it. We have let ourselves down.

‘We know we can play better but we have to be at our maximum against top teams. That was the best performance by England against us for a long time.’
