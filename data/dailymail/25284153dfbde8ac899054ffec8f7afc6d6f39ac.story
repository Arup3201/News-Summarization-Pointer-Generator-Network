A car was split fully in half after it hit a power pole on Sunday morning - but the person driving the vehicle was nowhere to be found.

Police were alerted to the wrecked red 2000 Pontiac Grand Am on the side of the road in Des Moines, Iowa, by an anonymous tip around 3:45 a.m.

When they arrived on the scene, they discovered the vehicle severed in two, with the rear end entirely crushed. Surprisingly, however, the front half was intact.

'The front doors, I was told, actually could be opened and closed without a problem,' police spokesman Sgt. Jason Halifax told KCCI.

'Given that information, it's not totally unlikely someone could have walked away from that accident.'

Confused detectives found no sign of the driver, and even after bringing in a sniffer dog to search the area, they were no closer to knowing who crashed the car and whether they were OK.

'They searched the area for well over an hour, had a dog come in, the dog wasn't able to find anything,' Halifax said, adding that there was no sign of blood.

Pole: The car wrapped itself around a power pole, pictured, early Sunday morning

Police also checked local hospitals for anyone who might have injuries consistent with a car crash but failed to find any patients who fit the bill, according to WHOTV.com.

'What the officers do now is they go to that last person who had the vehicle registered to them and basically ask them, "Where's the car now? What did you do with the car? Did you sell it, loan it out? What happened with it?"' Halifax told the station.

The Pontiac didn't have license plates when it was found and its last registration expired in August 2012.

Rear: But the rear half of the vehicle, pictured, was completely destroyed

Later, police located the owner of the car, who told police she believes someone who was at her house might have taken the car without permission while she slept. However, she refused to say who it was, according to Yahoo News.

'I've never seen anything like this,' Adam Garris of G & S Services, the company that towed the 2000 Pontiac Grand Am, told WHOTV.com.

'Thatâ€™s definitely one of the craziest accidents, one of the worst accidents I've seen.'
