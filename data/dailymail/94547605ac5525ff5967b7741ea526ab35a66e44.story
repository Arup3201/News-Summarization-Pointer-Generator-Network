A massive security operation – one of
the biggest seen at a court case in the UK – has been mounted 
surrounding a court case into the death of two female PCs.

It involves up to 150 officers, many of them armed, with marksmen on the rooftops of surrounding buildings as a court hears the case of Dale Cregan, charged with four murders and four charges of attempted murder.

The armed officers bristled with 
equipment, including the state-of-the-art Heckler & Koch G36C 
assault rifle, capable of firing 600 rounds per minute and boasting an 
effective range of almost 800 metres.

Equipped: Officers are carrying assault rifles, pistols, CS gas and wearing the latest body armour for protection

Many
were also armed with the Austrian-made Glock handgun, which holds 17 
bullets and is noted for its reliability and accuracy. It was recently 
adopted as the sidearm of the UK's armed forces.

As
well as firearms, they are equipped with crippling CS gas spray, Kevlar
body armour, helmets and goggles, extra ammo as well as handcuffs and 
communications equipment.

A killer ambushed two female police officers and sprayed them with bullets – stopping only when he ran out of ammunition, a court heard yesterday.

Trial: Dale Cregan (left in police mugshot, right in court today) had evaded a national manhunt when he set a trap, Preston Crown Court heard

After shooting them with a Glock pistol, one-eyed Dale Cregan, 29, threw a grenade at the unarmed WPCs as they lay near each other, it was alleged.

Cregan had called police with reports of a fictitious burglary and PC Fiona Bone, 32 and PC Nicola Hughes, 23, were sent to investigate, the jury heard.

Yesterday Cregan, who wears a black false onyx eye, appeared in court charged with four murders and four charges of attempted murder.

He and nine other defendants appeared in a dock packed with security staff for the start of the trial at Preston Crown Court.

The parents of both officers – Susan and Bryn Hughes and Paul and June Bone – sat in court stern-faced as the case was opened against Cregan.

The jury was told a wave of violence 
that erupted on the streets of Manchester last year was triggered by a 
row between two families.

Nicholas
Clarke, prosecuting, said: ‘The Short family had been involved over a 
number of years in a long-standing feud with members of another local 
family, the Atkinsons.

'The families had reached a state of uneasy peace 
following a lengthy dispute.’

But the court heard that peace was 
shattered when an argument flared between Raymond Young, a member of the
Short family, and Theresa Atkinson, the matriarch of her family.

Atkinson allegedly lashed out with a bottle, hitting Young, who 
retaliated by ‘back-handing’ her. She responded by shouting: ‘I’m going 
to get you done by my sons. You just wait here, you’re dead.’

Days later, Atkinson’s son, Leon, 35, recruited Cregan to attack the 
Short family, the court heard. As well as Cregan, others including 
Anthony Wilkinson, 33, Luke Livesey, 27, Damian Gorman, 38, Matthew 
James, 33 and Ryan Hadfield, 28, were brought in.

The jury heard that in May last year the Short family and friends had 
gone for an evening out and ended up at the Cotton Tree pub in 
Droylsden, Manchester.

Mr Clarke QC said last orders had been called and the landlord was 
tidying up when the door opened and a man wearing a balaclava stepped 
in.

‘The gunman took a single step into the pub and lifted his right 
arm,’ Mr Clarke said. ‘In his outstretched hand was a gun. The gun was 
fired.’

Drinkers in the pub saw Mark Short fall to the floor and three 
more men – John Collins, Michael Belcher and Ryan Pridding – were also 
hit.

David Short, 46, had gone to the toilet at the time of the shooting and 
returned to find his son fatally wounded on the pub floor. Mark Short, 
23, died in his father’s arms.

Less than three months later, David Short himself was shot dead in a gun and grenade attack at his home.

Mr Clarke said: ‘David Short was . . . chased through his house, being shot as he ran.

‘He was murdered in a hail of gunfire from two weapons carried by Cregan and Wilkinson.’

He added: ‘David Short had been shot at least nine times to his head and
body. He was chased from his kitchen, into his conservatory and 
outside.

‘He eventually fell in an alleyway at the side of his house. A grenade was then thrown on to him, causing massive injuries.’

Victims: Cregan is accused of the murders of David Short (left), 46, and his son, Mark (right), 23, in the months before allegedly killing the Greater Manchester Police constables

Tests on bullet casings found at the scene of the shooting showed they were typical of those used in a Glock pistol.

Mr Clarke said: ‘This was the Glock that Cregan would use again on 
September 18, 2012, when he murdered PC Fiona Bone and PC Nicola 
Hughes.’

Cregan, originally from Droylsden, Manchester, pleaded not guilty to 
four charges of murder, four attempted murders and one of causing an 
explosion. Leon Atkinson, Livesey, Gorman, Hadfield, James, Wilkinson, 
Francis Dixon, 37, Jermaine Ward, 24, and Mohammed Ali, 26, all pleaded 
not guilty to a variety of offences.

The trial continues.
