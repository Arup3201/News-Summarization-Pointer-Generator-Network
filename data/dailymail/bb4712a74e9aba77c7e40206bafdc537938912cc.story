A dance student told yesterday how she fought off a sex offender who tried to drag her into his car in broad daylight.

Nicola Thompson, 22, said she was determined not to be raped by sexual predator Mark Trim and screamed and struggled to escape his clutches.

She has waived her right to anonymity to speak out, and  to urge other women who find themselves at the mercy of sex attackers to put up the same resistance she did.

Courage: Dance student Nicola Thompson, left, summoned all her strength to fight off attacker Mark Trim, right, who tried to grab her off a street in St Helens, Merseyside, on May 3, this year, Liverpool Crown Court heard

‘I found it natural to fight back, she said. ‘He’s a disgusting man and it shows how his twisted brain works.’

Trim,
 36, described as having a warped sexual appetite, has been jailed for 
more than five years for attempted kidnap and attempting to commit a sex
 offence.

Miss Thompson said: ‘I wanted to speak out to show other women
 they should fight back. If it wasn’t me, it would have been someone 
else, or even a child.

‘I feel relieved Trim is locked up. If any 
other woman is in that position, make as much noise as possible to get 
someone’s attention.’

Trim had been driving the streets of St Helens, Merseyside in his Golf GTi looking for a victim when he spotted Miss Thompson.

The student, who had been texting her friend, found her path suddenly blocked by Trim, who dragged her towards the vehicle.

But
 she gave him a shock when she fought back, resisting his attempts to 
bundle her into the car and eventually pulling free.

She said: ‘He 
grabbed me by the upper arms. I screamed and he tried to drag me into 
the car and I was trying to fight him off.’

Alarmed by the noise she 
made, Trim gave up and sped off, leaving Miss Thompson sprawling on the 
road with cuts and bruises to her body.

She managed to note the last 
three digits of the Golf’s registration plate before getting help from a
 passer-by.

But Miss Thompson was left so traumatised by the attack 
on May 3 that she lost the ability to speak and now suffers panic 
attacks when she is out alone.

She added: ‘After it happened, I 
couldn’t speak. I was in shock. I was fine until a couple of months ago 
when it really hit me and I started struggling and had to go to the 
doctors for help with everyday tasks.

'It affected my college work, it 
impacted on me massively and I started having panic attacks, flashbacks 
and nightmares.’

Trim initially denied involvement in the attack, 
but changed his plea at Liverpool Crown Court last month after number 
plate recognition technology and analysis of his mobile phone records pinpointed him to the scene.

Jailing him for attempted kidnap and intent
 to commit a sexual offence, Judge Robert Warnock said: ‘Your motive was
 to gratify your own warped sexual appetite.

‘You present a serious 
risk of significant injury. You are a predatory offender from whom the 
public are entitled to be protected.’

He contrasted Trim’s ‘cowardly
 attack’ with the courage demonstrated by Miss Thompson, saying: ‘The 
public have cause to be grateful to her.’

Trim, a registered sex 
offender with a previous conviction for indecent exposure in 2011, had 
become a regular cocaine user following the breakdown of his marriage.

The father of one harboured disturbing fantasies about non-consensual sex with women and was prone to stress, the court heard.
