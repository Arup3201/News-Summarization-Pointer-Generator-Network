A former Catholic school vice principal says he was fired from the job for marrying his male partner.

Mark Zmuda said in a YouTube video that officials at Eastside 
Catholic School in Seattle, Washington said he was being terminated because of his recent 
marriage.

Mr Zmuda also says the head of the school even suggested that he could 
get a divorce and keep his job. Zmuda says he rejected the idea of 
getting a divorce from husband Dana Jergens.

School attorney Mike Patterson says the vice principal agreed in two 
December conversations that he was resigning from the job, not being 
fired.

Patterson says the divorce suggestion was a hypothetical idea 
that was never seriously explored.

Many students at Eastside Catholic have rallied in support of Zmuda and protested his departure.

One student, Catrina Chritenden conducted an interview with Mr Zmuda and his husband Mr Jergens which was posted to YouTube on January 4.

Mr Zmuda confirmed that he had been terminated from his job.

He said that he was told by school officials that he was let go because he was 'married to a man which violated Catholic teaching'.

Mr Zmuda said that although he loved working at the Catholic high school and valued its principles, he disagreed on the Church's stance against gay marriage.

He said: 'People don't choose to be straight or gay, instead they discover it... I just disagree with the way the church feels on this particular issue.'

More than 30,000 people have now signed an online petition calling on the Catholic Church to change its policy on gay marriage.

This weekend a rally was held at the Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle in support of the vice principal.

Demonstrators held signs reading 'Keep Mr Z', 'God is Love' and the remark made by Pope Francis: 'If someone is gay... who am I to judge?' 

Mr Zmuda said he was told by school officials that he was let go because his same-sex marriage violated Catholic teachings
