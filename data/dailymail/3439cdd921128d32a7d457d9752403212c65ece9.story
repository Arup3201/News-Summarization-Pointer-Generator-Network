These are the jaw-dropping images that could have cost a courageous Russian photographer his life.

Mike Korostelev travelled to Banco Chinchorro in Mexico in the hope of getting close-up snaps of American crocodiles in their natural habitat - and that's exactly what he got.

The nine foot long crocodile not only circled him, it got so close it nuzzled his camera and even touched him with its tail.

Extreme close-up: The three-metre long crocodile came so close to Mike Korostelev in  Banco Chinchorro,  Mexico, that it nuzzled his camera lens

Tail whip: The crocodile's long tail touched Mr Korostelv as it swam past him in a series of curious swoops

Close enough to kill: Mr Korostelev said getting this close to the crocodile was 'not an accidental meeting'

But far from being scared, Mr Korostelev was delighted with his deadly encounter.

He said: 'It was not an accidental meeting, the main purpose of my trip was to capture an American crocodile in its natural environment.

'I met this crocodile underwater face to face. When it swam close to me, the only thought I had was about how great it was that I could take great pictures.

'It nuzzled into the camera several times and sometimes it touched me with its tail.'

Walking like a crocodile: The reptile walks along the sea floor as it hunts for food

Stealth mode: The crocodile slides along the sea floor and can barely be seen amongst the marine plants

Toothy smile: Mr Korostelev said when he spotted the reptiles he immediately jumped in the water and was in no hurry to get out

Mr Korostelev travelled to a remote fisherman's hut and stayed there with a group of other photographers who hunted the crocodiles with their cameras.

He said: 'When crocodiles came close to our hunt, I immediately jumped into the water with my camera and spent as much time as possible.

'Sometimes they stayed for three hours. Of course it is deadly, crocodiles are dangerous wild animals.'
