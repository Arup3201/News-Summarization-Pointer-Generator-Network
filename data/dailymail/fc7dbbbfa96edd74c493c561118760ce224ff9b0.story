The 'Today Show' beat 'Good Morning America' for a full week in ratings for the first time in two years.

The Sochi Olympics helped to boost NBC's 'Today Show' which during the first week of the Olympic Games topped 'Good Morning America's' ratings by 4 per cent in viewers.

That's 211,000 more audience viewers than 'Good Morning America' had, reports The Wrap.

The Huffington Post reports that the small rating increase assures 'Today' that it will no longer trail behind 'Good Morning America for 16 years as 'Good Morning America' did before triumphantly beating the 'Today Show' in 2012.

'Today' will now need to do its best to ensure that beating out 'Good Morning America' is not only Olympics related.

The 'Today Show' consists of a group of hosts named Natalie Morales, Savannah Guthrie, Matt Lauer and Al Roker.

'Good Morning America' is presented Robin Roberts, George Stephanopoulos, Josh Elliott,Lara Spencer, and Ginger Zee.

The race for morning television has grown increasingly competitive this week especially when 'Good Morning America' beat it's rival the 'Today Show' for the first time on Tuesday since 'Today' was in the lead.

The 'Today show' also beat 'Good Morning America' in the show's key demographic of adults 25-54 last week by 8 per cent, or 185,000 viewers.

The Wrap reports that while the 'Today' show did well this week at the Sochi Olympics, it did better during the same week during the Vancouver Olympics.During week one of Vancouver, 'Today' topped 'Good Morning America' by 1.8 million total viewers. 'Today' won the Olympic race for viewers but whether or not they can keep up the good work is still to be determined.
