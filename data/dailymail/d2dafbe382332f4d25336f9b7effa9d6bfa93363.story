The Duke of Edinburgh is ‘responding well’ to hospital treatment for his recurrent bladder infection, Buckingham Palace said yesterday.

The 91-year-old was taken to hospital by ambulance on Wednesday after the infection that first affected him in June – forcing him to miss part of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations – flared up again.

Palace officials insisted that the move was a ‘precautionary measure’ and said doctors were likely to keep him in  Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for further treatment and observation.

Medics are understood to be treating his latest infection with antibiotics.

A statement from the Palace said: ‘The
 Duke of Edinburgh is responding well to treatment. It is unclear when 
he will be discharged, but he is likely to remain in hospital for a few 
more days.’

Prince Philip was staying at the Queen’s Balmoral retreat when he complained of feeling cold during a carriage-driving trip.

It came within hours of his return from official engagements on the Isle of Wight.

Appearance: The Duke spent Monday and Tuesday on the Isle of Wight, carrying out several public engagements

The Duke had met wellwishers and strolled around the Isle of Wight during his public engagements earlier this week, but has since been hospitalised

It is the third time in eight months that he has needed hospital treatment, following successful heart surgery over Christmas.

The Duke has been closely  monitored 
by doctors since the scare, but his latest health problems have raised 
questions about his continued workload.

The Duke has carried out more than 100
 official engagements  since December – including a  gruelling Jubilee 
tour of Britain  and Northern Ireland – when a stent was inserted to 
clear a blocked coronary artery.

He was carrying out official duties just three weeks later.

'Precaution': The Duke's visit to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary comes after he suffered a bladder infection during the Diamond Jubilee celebrations

Despite his advancing years, he still 
undertakes around 350  public engagements each year and continues to 
pride himself on his active lifestyle.

Royal biographer Hugo Vickers said: ‘He is the sort of person who wants to keep on going.

‘I don’t think it is part of his  
make-up to slow down. I think he just wants to keep going until he 
drops. He is still very interested in life.

'That is how people of their 
age keep going.’

The Queen and other royals are being 
kept closely informed about the Duke’s condition, but are  understood 
not to have visited him in hospital.

Philip refused to receive any  
well-wishers when he was admitted to hospital with a chest infection in 
2008, instead choosing to catch up on paperwork.

His latest illness may 
mean he cannot accompany the Queen to the opening of the  Paralympic 
Games on August 29, and will increase pressure on Prince William to 
become a full-time working royal.

The Duke and Duchess of  Cambridge are
 due to carry out an eight-day tour of the Far East next month, 
including visits to Singapore, Malaysia and the Solomon Islands.
