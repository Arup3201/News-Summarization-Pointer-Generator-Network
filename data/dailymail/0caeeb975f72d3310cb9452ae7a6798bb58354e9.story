It’s certainly not your average city view when looking out of a downtown Manhattan flat.

A World War One fighter plane sits on top of the roof of a 26-storey tower built by the William Kaufman Organization more than 40 years ago in New York City near Wall Street.

Locals have often wondered how it got there - and whether the 1916 British Sopwith Camel landed on the roof of 77 Water Street. Now they have a definitive answer.

Spot the Sopwith: A World War One fighter plane sits on top of the roof of a 26-storey tower built by the William Kaufman Organization more than 40 years ago in Manhattan, New York

The William Kaufman Organization decided it wanted something a little different to air-conditioning and water tanks to adorn the roof of its new building in the 1960s, reported the Wall Street Journal.

‘You can’t just impose these buildings 
and ignore the people that have to look at them. It’s very satisfying when you do something people 
so appreciate’

Robert Kaufman

Company president Robert Kaufman said they thought looking down on buildings from higher up usually made for an ugly view.

‘So we said: “What can we do?”,’ he explained. ‘And we got the idea of putting an airplane on the roof.’

‘You can’t just impose these buildings and ignore the people that have to look at them,’ he told the Wall Street Journal. ‘It’s very satisfying when you do something that people so appreciate.’

Previous mystery: Locals have often wondered whether the 1916 British Sopwith Camel landed on the roof of 77 Water Street and how it got there

But the plane never landed on the roof.

It is actually an artistic re-imagining of the 1916 aircraft that was designed by Rudolph de Harak and constructed by sculptor William Tarr.

The Sopwith Camel was hoisted into place by a crane in 1969 and has been there ever since.

Developer Shawn Hakimian has housing on 
Wall Street overlooking the building on Water Street, where the biplane 
is parked on a landing strip with runway lights.

Starting point: This Sopwith F-1 Camel shows what the artistic re-imagining of the 1916 aircraft was based on

‘It’s not every day you see an airplane taking off from a New York City building,’ he told the Wall Street Journal. ‘It’s one of our buyers’ most commonly asked questions.’

But 77 Water Street is not the only Kaufman-owned building with a twist in New York City.

A three-storey chess board can be found on a cement wall at 767 Third Avenue, where historic matches have been recreated. And a cat cashing a canary on tiles can be seen at 127 John Street.
