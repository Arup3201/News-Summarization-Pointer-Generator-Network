A car filled with explosives rammed into a U.S. government vehicle in the north-west Pakistani city of Peshawar today, killing three people and wounding 19 others.

Two Americans and two Pakistanis working at the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar were among the wounded, according to a U.S. Embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Two of the dead were Pakistanis.

The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad had earlier denied initial reports that two Americans were killed in the blast.

Wreckage: A car filled with explosives rammed into a U.S. government vehicle in the north-west Pakistani city of Peshawar today, killing three and wounding 19

Peshawar is located near Pakistan's semi-autonomous tribal region, the main sanctuary for Taliban and al-Qaida militants in the country.

The city has been hit by scores of bombings in recent years, but attacks against American targets are relatively rare, likely because of the extensive security measures taken by the U.S. government.

The vehicle was attacked after it left the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar and was travelling through an area of the city that hosts various international organisations, including the United Nations, said police officer Pervez Khan, who was part of the security escort for the vehicle as it moved.

Local TV footage showed an SUV at the site that was completely destroyed and burned. All that was left was a carcass of blackened, twisted metal.

Officer Khan said the images were of the U.S. vehicle that was attacked.

A police explosives expert, Abdul Haq, said 240lbs of explosives were used in the attack.

Irfan Khan, a local resident, was at a nearby shop when the blast occurred.

He said: 'I quickly looked back in panic to see smoke and dust erupt from the scene.

'I ran toward the scene along with others and saw two vehicles destroyed and the larger vehicle on fire.'

One dead person was on the ground near the SUV, and a foreigner was injured, he said.

'We put the injured man and the dead body in a private vehicle,' said Mr Khan. 'There were more injured in the surrounding area too.'

Another eyewitness, Wajid Ali, said he helped put a seriously injured foreigner into the vehicle.

But another vehicle arrived, presumably from the U.S. Consulate, and took away the injured foreigners, said Officer Khan.

Some of the policemen escorting the U.S. vehicle were also wounded in the attack, and their vehicle was damaged.
