Authorities in Alaska 
say they are investigating claims by a confessed Anchorage killer that 
he is responsible for three additional deaths.

A
 news release says Joshua Wade has agreed to provide information on 
three additional killings. In exchange, prosecutors will transfer him to
 a federal prison outside Alaska.

Wade was convicted of killing nurse Mindy Schloss and convicted of evidence tampering in the death of Della Brown.

Authorities in Alaska say they are investigating claims by confessed Anchorage killer Joshua Wade that he is responsible for three additional deaths

KTVA-TV reports Wade contacted them several times last winter and told them he killed three others.

Wade
 says he killed someone when he was 14 and strangled someone else five 
years later during a botched robbery. He says the third unrevealed 
killing occurred the night Brown died.

He says there was a man with Brown whom he beat and shot.

Wade, 34, has admitted killing Della Brown and Mindy Schloss.

Wade
 was sentenced to life in prison in February 2010 in the 2007 death of 
Schloss, a neighbor who worked as a nurse practitioner.

'I deserve much worse,' he tearfully said at his state court sentencing.

In
 a signed plea agreement for the slaying, Wade also acknowledged that he
 killed Brown, another Anchorage woman, in September 2000 by hitting her
 on the head with a large rock.

Brown's battered, partially-nude body 
was found in an abandoned shed.

Wade pleaded guilty in federal court to first-degree murder and carjacking in the 2007 death of Mindy Schloss Schloss, a nurse who lived next door

Wade also admitted to killing Della Brown, an Alaska Native woman whose battered, partially-clothed body was found in an abandoned shed in Anchorage

An Anchorage 
jury acquitted Wade of Brown's murder but convicted him of tampering 
with evidence, for which he served 6  1/2 years in prison.

In
 telephone calls last winter from jail to KTVA, Wade claimed he killed 
someone else when he was 14 and five years later, strangled someone in a
 botched robbery.

The third additional death, 
he said, came the night Brown was killed. There was a man with her in 
the shed. Wade told the station he knocked the man unconscious, put him 
in the trunk of his car, and then went for drinks.

When he returned, he heard thumping in the trunk.

'And
 I opened it, nobody was around, it was dark, and pulled him out and 
pretty sure that I'd killed him that time by stomping on his head,' Wade
 told the station, which didn't air the interviews last winter but did 
so Thursday night, after police announced the news conference.

'I drove 
out to the valley, found a spot, took the guy out, took his clothes off 
and shot him in the head two times with a shotgun and pretty much took 
everything from the shoulders up.'

Months 
after his release from the evidence-tampering conviction, Wade bound, 
gagged and kidnapped Schloss, shooting her in a wooded area near 
Wasilla.

Wade was sentenced to 99 years in 
prison for the murder of Schloss. A state court judge placed a 
restriction on the parole board to make Wade serve at least 66 years.

If
 Wade were to be released after that, at age 95, he would be turned over
 to federal authorities to serve out the remainder of a life sentence 
for murder committed during a carjacking.

That
 sentence was handed down in federal court, where Wade got into a heated
 exchange with U.S. District Court Judge Ralph Beistline, who called 
Wade heartless, selfish and a coward.

Red-eyed with emotion, Joshua Wade is seen with defense attorneys Jim McComas, left, and Cynthia Strout, right, after an Anchorage, Alaska, jury cleared him of murder charges Wednesday, April 16, 2003

In an angry voice, Wade told the judge, 'Don't push it, man.'

Beistline responded, "I'm going to push it."

Wade
 repeated the threat, and the judge said the angry outburst was very 
revealing and underscored what a danger Wade would be if free.

Wade denied to the station that he was a serial killer.

'Absolutely not,' he responded. And his advice to people who think he is a serial killer: 'Quit reading books.'
