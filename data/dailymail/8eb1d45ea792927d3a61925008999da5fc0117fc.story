Algerian 1,500 metres medal contender Taoufik Makhloufi, who was thrown out of the Olympics for not trying hard enough in his 800m heat yesterday morning, has been reinstated.

Makhloufi won his 1500m semi-final in style on Sunday and looked destined for a podium finish in Tuesday's grandstand final.

But the 24-year-old was banned from taking any further part in the London Games after he gave up less than half way through his first 800m heat today.

Banned: Makhloufi was excluded from all future events at the London Olympics for failing to try his best in a men's 800m Round 1 heat on Monday before being reinstated after providing medical reasons for not finishing

Algeria had attempted to withdraw the athlete from the two lap event, but missed Sunday's deadline - forcing him to take part today, or risk expulsion from the Games.

He lined up at the start of heat five at the Olympic stadium on Monday but 
was already well behind the field at the start of the back straight 
before stopping running completely another 100 metres into the race and 
wandering back across the infield past the pole vault area.

Officials at the International Association of Athletics Federations were so incensed by his lack of effort they kicked him out of all competition.

The IAAF announced in a statement: 'The Referee considered that he had not provided a bona fide effort and decided to exclude him from participation in all further events in the competition.'

But he has now been reinstated in today's 1,500 final after providing adequate medical reasons for his failure to finish the 800m, the IAAF has confirmed.

An IAAF statement read: 'After reviewing evidence provided by a LOCOG medical officer, the disqualification of athlete Taoufik Makhloufi from further participation in the athletics competition of the 2012 Olympic Games has been revoked by the IAAF technical delegates.

Vast difference: Makhloufi led the pack in the men's 1500m heats on August 3

'Consequently, Mr Makhloufi is able to compete in the men's 1500m final.'

Makhloufi, the African champion in the 800, has shown a marked improvement this year, bringing his personal best down from 3.32.94 to 3.30.80 in the 1,500.

The exclusion is the latest in a string of incidents at the Games where athletes have not tried to win in order to manipulate results or draws in their ultimate favour.

The worst was the badminton fiasco, where eight women from China, Indonesia and South Korea were thrown out of the Olympics for playing to lose group matches in order to get a better draw in the knockout stages.

There have been other incidents which have not drawn any punishment, with organisers deciding that spectators had not been denied a competition.

French rider Mickael Bourgain quit the cycling road race after just a few kilometres as planned on the first weekend of the Games having been forced to take part in order to compete in his favoured keirin track event.

Makhloufi stormed past Olympic and world champion Asbel Kiprop in a stunning to finish to his 1,500 heat on Sunday, winning in three minutes 42.24 seconds

Injured: Algeria's Taoufik Makhloufi suffered an injury after the men's 1500m semi-finals on Sunday

Last Thursday, teenage cyclist Philip Hindes appeared to admit he deliberately crashed in cycling's team sprint event to ensure Britain were handed a restart because they set off badly.

Earlier today it was announced American judoka Nicholas Delpopolo has been disqualified from the Olympics after failing a drugs test.

The 23-year-old competed in the men's 73kg division and was tested on July 30 after his loss to Mongolian Nyam-Ochir Sainjargal in the repechage stage.

The International Olympic Committee said Delpopolo tested positive for 11-nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid, which is connected to cannabis consumption.

Delpopolo admitted his guilt but claimed he had not deliberately taken a banned substance.

According to the IOC ruling, Delpopolo 'explained that his positive test was caused by his inadvertent consumption of food (prior to his leaving for the London Olympic Games) that he did not realise had been baked with marijuana.'

Delpopolo has apologised to the United States Olympic Committee and team-mates and, according to the IOC, 'indicated that he was embarrassed by this mistake'.
