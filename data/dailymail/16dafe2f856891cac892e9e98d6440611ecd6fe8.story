Rich people in America have better and more sleep than people with lower incomes, a study revealed (above file photo)

Rich people get more sleep than people with lower incomes, a study revealed.

Ethnic minority students, along with students from lower-income families or those living in urban areas get less sleep compared to wealthier white males, according to the Columbia University study.

Researchers surveyed 270,000 students in America from both public and private schools between 1991 and 2012, and asked them: How often they slept for more than seven hours a night and how often they sleep less than they should. 

The recommended amount of sleep for adolescents is nine hours, however students from lower-income families and ethnic minorities did not report having more than seven hours of sleep a night.

This could be due to housing quality, obesity and conditions that disrupt sleep, according to researchers

Surprisingly, while these students received less than the recommended amount, they reported they felt they had received enough rest.

Girls reported having less hours of sleep compared to boys. Factors that are potentially contributing to the decline of recommended sleep includes the increase use of the Internet and social media, and demands of school and extracurricular activities (above file photo)

Stick to the same bedtime: Sleep experts believe going to bed and waking up at the same times on a regular basis is vital for healthy sleep. This is because humans have an inbuilt body clock called the circadian rhythm. Controlled by hypothalamus at the base of the brain, it governs the body's daily alternation between sleep and wakefulness.

Take a hot bath: Taking a hot bath before bed can help induce sleep, says Paul Martin, author of a new book called Counting Sheep.

This is because your body temperature has a strong influence on how fast you fall asleep. A night's sleep is normally proceeded by a slight drop in body temperature and scientists have established that this drop in temperature tells your body to go to sleep.

The theory behind taking a hot bath is to raise your body temperature artificially before allowing it to drop again as it adjusts to the cooler environment of your room. The trick, says Martin, is to take a bath one to two hours before bedtime and keep your bath temperature warm, rather than hot.

Treat yourself to a hot, milky drink: It may sound like an old wives' tale but taking a hot milky drink can encourage drowsiness because milk contains sleep-enhancing properties.

This is thanks to its calcium content, which sleep experts claim can help you relax. It is also rich in tryptophan, which the body converts into serotonin - a natural hormone in the body that can make you sleepy.

This compares to coffee - which is twice as stimulating as tea due to its high caffeine content. Sleep experts recommend drinking coffee no later than within two to three hours of going to bed, so that your body has a chance to process the caffeine.

This disparity could mean those from lower-income families and ethnic minorities have not received enough education on the importance of sleep when it comes to health.

Students from middle and higher-income families who had parents that received a high school education regularly reported having more than seven hours of sleep.

The study also found that girls had less hours of sleep a night compared to boys.

The recommended amount of sleep for adolescents is nine hours, however students from lower-income families and ethnic minorities did not report having more than seven hours of sleep a night. Over the years, 15-year-old children had the biggest drop in sleep as it dropped nine per cent from 1991 and 2012 (above a graph of the amount of sleep adolescents receive by age group)

Over the years, 15-year-old children had the biggest drop in sleep as it decreased a total of nine per cent - from 71.5 per cent in 1991 to 63 per cent in 2012.

And generally, there has been a decline in adolescents who are not getting enough sleep, one-third, which could be a public health concern.

Factors that are potentially contributing to the decline of recommended sleep includes the increase use of the Internet and social media, and demands of school and extracurricular activities.
