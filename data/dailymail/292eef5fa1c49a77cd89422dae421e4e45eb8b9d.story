Battle-weary Ukrainian soldiers have converted a school into a military barracks where they are sent to catch up on their R&R before being shipped back to the front line.

Poignant new pictures show soldiers of the Azov Battalion dressed in full military gear as they play basketball in the school gym, climb the playground and sleep on classroom couches.

The Ukrainian Army is currently fighting pro-Russian rebels for control of the village of Shyrokyne, east of the port city of Mariupol.

It comes as sporadic reports of deaths and violence continue to emerge from the war zone despite a recently-agreed ceasefire deal.

At least one Ukrainian serviceman has been killed and three wounded as a result of fighting in separatist eastern territories in the past 24 hours, the military has confirmed.

However, attacks have fallen significantly in the past two weeks, but accusations of continued violence on both sides show the fragility of the peace accord agreed in Minsk last month.

The deal called for the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line, a promise adhered to in parts.

Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said: 'There is increased activity of sniper groups. The serviceman who was killed died at the hands of a sniper.'

He added that while the Minsk agreements were broadly observed along the front lines, and the intensity of provocative attacks had dropped significantly, rebels continued to fire on government positions.

Kiev accuses the separatists of using the ceasefire to regroup their forces and rearm for a further offensive, a charge the rebels deny, saying they have withdrawn heavy artillery in accordance with the Minsk peace deal.

'Illegal armed groups are actively involved in combat training, gathering resources and rebuilding technical readiness,' Lysenko said, adding that rebels had been tracked amassing combat equipment around their stronghold of Donetsk.

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors the pull-back of weapons, has said it cannot fully confirm withdrawal on both sides as it has not been given access to all the locations where some weapons have been moved.

However, Germany's foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier claims violence has reduced significantly since the ceasefire deal was agreed.

He said: 'A clear beginning was made. There's a significant reduction of violence after hardships at the beginning. Today, we don't have hundreds of breaches of the ceasefire, there are not many question marks regarding it.'

Russia and Ukraine have agreed to double the number of OSCE observers to 1,000 from 500 to monitor a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine.
