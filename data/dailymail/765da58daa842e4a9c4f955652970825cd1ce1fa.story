It might seem like an ordinary meal to most, composed of steak, sweet potato mash and four kinds of vegetables. 

But this particular dish has been dubbed the perfect meal for athletes by performance nutrition experts. 

Comprising an 8oz New York sirloin strip steak served with sweet potato mash, kale, samphire, mange tout and broccoli, the hearty offering has all right balance of protein, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals.

Athletes need the right balance of protein, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals in their meals 

The meal was served by London chef and former Olympian Francis Agyepong at Christopher's restaurant in Covent Garden to Olympic gold medallist Christine Ohuruogu and world junior champion Dina Asher-Smith. 

Mr Agyepong, who competed in the Triple Jump for Great Britain at the Barcelona and Atlanta Olympics, has since developed his career as a head chef in London's West End.

He said: 'In creating this ultimate athlete menu, I have focused on nutrition first and foremost. The dish is ideal for energy, recovery and tissue rebuilding. 

Steak is high in protein, which is excellent for muscle recovery and also in iron stores which helps reduce fatigue. It's an ideal meat for athletes to consume during their training programme.

Sweet potato is an excellent carbohydrate source so it contributes to the recovery of normal muscle function after hard training. 

The green veg provides vitamins A and C which support the immune system to function normally, which is hampered with hard training.

'The quality of ingredients used and the resulting taste also has a positive effect on the mind and general wellbeing.

'Food and nutrition is a big part of everyone's lives but to an athlete it can mean the difference between having a short or long sustained career. 

'The body has the ability to self-repair if the food you are putting in it is of premium quality.'  

The athlete turned head chef worked with worked with Sainsbury's and British Athletics' performance nutritionist Joseph Agu to create a perfect menu for Ms Ohuruogu and Ms Asher-Smith, as they prepare for the 2015 athletics season.

The season will see Ms Ohuruogu bid to retain her world 400m title in Beijing, where she won Olympic gold in 2008.

Mr Agu said: 'This is the perfect meal for an athlete, with the right balance of protein, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals.

Dina Asher-Smith, who was crowned British 60m champion at the Sainsbury's Indoor British Championships last weekend and will compete at the Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix in Birmingham on Saturday, said: 'As a young athlete I'm always looking for ways to improve my performance, so good nutrition is key. 

'Ahead of a big event it's important to eat properly, and as the experts have identified, this dish is perfect for an athlete.'

Christine Ohuruogu said: 'Nutrition is a very important part of athletics, and it's great that Francis and Joseph have identified a dish which will help our training, but also taste great. 

'Healthy eating is a big part of my life, so I'm really pleased to see Sainsbury's using their sponsorship of athletics to inspire others to live a healthy lifestyle.'
