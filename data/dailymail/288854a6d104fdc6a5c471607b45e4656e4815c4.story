The Tesla Model S P85D is best known for it stomach-churning acceleration and zero-RMP torque.

But just as impressive is a little-known feature that gives it the ability to receive over-the-air software updates any time a Tesla engineer discovers an improvement.

Now one of these upgrades is set to make the P85D even faster, according to a tweet by Tesla's founder, Elon Musk.

Earlier today, the group's founder, Elon Musk, revealed on Twitter that the P85D would be receiving an upgrade using a new algorithm that would make it even faster

'Tesla P85D 0 to 60mph acceleration will improve by ~0.1 sec soon via over-the-air software update to inverter algorithm.' he wrote. 

Musk was referring to something known as the 'insane mode' which allows the car to accelerate from 0 to 60 in a little over three seconds.

Earlier this week, a car website took passengers on a ride in the dual motor sedan and filmed their reactions when Insane mode hits. 

The video was filmed by Florida-based DragTimes. It shows a driver, known only as Brooks, taking people on a ride in the $120,000 (£80,000) car.

For each test, Brooks brings the car to a standstill before pushing the accelerator to the ground.

At the launch event, Mr Musk said the car reaches 60mph in three seconds from a standstill. During recent tests of the Insane acceleration, also carried out by DragTimes, the car achieved the speed in 3.17 seconds

The D model, unveiled in October has two motors - one powering the front wheels and one powering the rear wheels.

It has a top speed of 155 mph (249 km/h), compared with the current 130 mph (209 km/h) on Tesla’s previous S model.

It offers two Sport and Insane acceleration.

In Insane Mode, the full 691 horsepower of the electric car's two motors is applied in one go.

The car accelerates with a jolt, pushing both the driver and passenger back in their seat.

In one shot, a woman is shown holding onto the ceiling and clutching her chest in surprise.

During another shot, a child sitting in the back of the car loses control of her smartphone when the pedal is floored.

At the launch event, Mr Musk said the car reaches 60mph in three seconds from standing still. 

During recent tests of the Insane acceleration, also carried out by DragTimes, the car achieved the speed in 3.17 seconds.

As the site explained: ‘There is no complicated launch control to engage, no traction control to disable, no power braking, no RPMs to worry about.

'All you have to do is stomp on the accelerator and off you go, pulling over 1.2Gs off the line, enough to embarrass and give a hard time to just about any car that might be next to you.’

These speeds put the P85D on a par with the likes of Lamborghini’s Gallardo LP570-4 Spyder Performante and the 2014 Porsche 911 GT3.

In Sport mode, by comparison, the same speed was reached in 4.04 seconds during DragTimes' tests.
