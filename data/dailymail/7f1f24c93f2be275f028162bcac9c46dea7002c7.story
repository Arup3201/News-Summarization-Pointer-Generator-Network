Amir Khan will donate his pair of £30,000  shorts to the Peshawar school in Pakistan where 132 children were killed by Taliban gunmen earlier this week.

Khan wore the shorts, featuring a waistband made from 24-carat gold thread, in a unanimous points victory over American Devon Alexander in Las Vegas which helped him retain the WBC silver welterweight title at the weekend.

'It was just very sad to see innocent kids being killed,' Khan said. 'I can only imagine what the parents are going through.

'I want to donate the shorts for the Peshawar cause, rebuild a school and strengthen security around the area.

'We are very lucky in England. We have good security and I will be able to send my little girl to school and know she will be fine but in Pakistan you cannot do that,' said Khan.

'They send the kids outside the house and do not know if they are going to come back.'

Khan's shorts were designed by Sophie Whittam, owner of Fight Label, and feature a 24 carat gold thread woven through a waist band supporting white nappa leather trunks with crocodile trim.

Ms. Whittam explained the detailed process behind the shorts last week.

'We weren't originally planning to do the 24 carat gold shorts, but then we had a very exciting opportunity with a new company called 24KT,' she told Sportsmail.

'They have a thousand exclusive members who can order any kind of clothing they wish, which can then be customised with 24 carat gold.

'Amir is one of their members so we then got talking and it was agreed we could use the 24 carat gold to make the waistband for his shorts.

'The outside of the shorts are covered in lamb nappa leather with crocodile trim, and then the lining is 100 per cent silk, so you have to combine all those materials through different machines - so it was a jigsaw to put them all together.

'But I want every fighter to be unique and have unusual fabrics - so it was worth it.

'We started about four months ago on the training kit and then we were brainstorming ideas before putting pen to paper.

'It's probably been a four to six week period process to piece it all together and finalising all the designs for the fight night shorts.

'It's been a really exciting process working with Amir. At Fight Label I want to create people's dream shorts and make them a reality to wear. When you look good you feel good, and then you fight better too.

'Whether or not we had the material from 24KT we still strive to make unusual, unique fabrics and there's so many more different styles and trends to explore - that's why I'm in this business.' 

The trunks, made specially for the fight, have genuine 24 carat gold thread woven into the waistband
