If Corey Spicer is in a rush to see his friends, he doesn't need to jump in the car - he just hops on his skateboard and his two canine chauffeurs pull him around town.

He can reach speeds of up to 20pmh with his two pet pitbulls - attached with fluorescent harnesses - pulling him through the streets of Fort Worth, Texas.

The 27-year-old came up with the idea when watching a music video by Blink 182, where the band's drummer Travis Barker is doing the same thing.

Mr Spicer, who has been skateboarding 
since the age of five, says that using his dogs as a mode of 
transportation can have real benefits.

A real estate agent Mr Spicer said: 'I have sold a lot of houses in my own neighbourhood to my friends, I currently have 16 of them living in a one mile radius from me.

'I use my dogs frequently to take me around to their houses to drop a quick hello to them.

Exercise: 'I let them pull me on my skateboard to wear them out, and to have a bonding session with my pups,' said Mr Spicer

Animal love: Mr Spicer also owns a cat, who he says the dogs look after like one of their own puppies

Thirsty work: One of the dogs, Layla, is part Pitbull and part Boxer and the other, Sadie, is a red-nosed Pitbull

'The main reason though is that I work from home and my dogs get annoying sometimes.

'I let them pull me on my skateboard to wear them out, and to have a bonding session with my pups.'

One of the dogs, Layla, is part Pitbull and part Boxer. The other, Sadie, is a red-nosed Pitbull.

He also owns a cat, who he says the dogs look after like one of their own puppies.

Corey, who has always had a passion for board sports, said: 'My Dad bought me a skateboard when I was four or five and I have been riding ever since.

'Wakeboarding and Snowboarding are what my real passions are but they are also very expensive.

'The beauty about a Skateboard is you can walk out your house a do it anywhere.'
