These images capture the breath-taking beauty of the British countryside enveloped in the early morning mist.

From the rolling hills of Dorset to the eerily beautiful Exmoor in Somerset, sales manager Bob Small's series of photographs highlights the picturesque nature of the English country as the sun rises over endless hills and fields.

And all it takes is a breath of fog over Somerset's Glastonbury Tor for it to transform into the legendary Isle of Avalon associated with King Arthur.
