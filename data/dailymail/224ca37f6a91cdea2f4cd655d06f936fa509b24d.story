Honoured: Stephen Wright has received the Paul Foot Award for investigative journalism for his reporting on the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation

Daily Mail journalist Stephen Wright has been honoured with a prestigious accolade for his 15 years of reporting on the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation.

Judges at the Paul Foot Award for investigative journalism created a Special Campaign Award to present him in recognition of his outstanding work.

His initial investigation led to Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre famously branding the suspects ‘Murderers’, in a front page headline in February 1997.

Wright then spearheaded the Mail’s Justice for Stephen campaign through to the trial and conviction of two of the original suspects last year.

The judges praised Wright for his ‘dogged reporting’ and for ‘securing a number of scoops, and breaking significant stories to keep the case in the public eye’.

They said: ‘This included reporting on the racist and violent pasts of the suspects and on police blunders, which led to the then home secretary Jack Straw ordering a public inquiry.

‘Stephen Wright highlighted the  need for double jeopardy laws to be reformed to allow three of Stephen Lawrence’s alleged killers (who had been acquitted) to stand trial again if new evidence emerged.’

The annual Award was set up by Private Eye and The Guardian in honour of the late investigative journalist, Paul Foot.

Private Eye editor Ian Hislop said: ‘The Paul Foot Awards this year are a powerful post-Leveson riposte to all those who want to think only the worst of journalists.

‘The shortlist celebrates those whose great skill is to make the public really interested in what is really in the public interest.’
