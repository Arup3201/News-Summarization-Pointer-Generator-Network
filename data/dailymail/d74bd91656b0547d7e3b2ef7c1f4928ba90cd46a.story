Postmen often have to keep an eye out for aggressive dogs while trying to make their deliveries.

But rather than a hound, it was a large spider that stopped letters being delivered to the home of Stuart Robertson-Reed.

Instead of a cheque the business analyst was waiting for, he found a note written by a scared postman which read: 'No access - massive spider web in front gate'.

Failed delivery: Mr Robertson-Reid eventually received his letter when it was delivered by the postman's colleague - who had written 'WHAT!' on the post

According to Mr Roberston-Reed the 'massive spider' was the size of a 10p coin.

The 42-year-old said he had noticed the animal by the side of his front gate - but had left it be to avoid breaking the web.

Mr Robertson-Reed said: 'I couldn't believe it. He was either spider-friendly and didn't want to break the web or a terrified arachnophobe.'

After a night away, Stuart found his mail had been delivered to his home in Clapham, South London, by another, less scared, postman.

Fear: The business analyst said the spider, which spun its web on the front gate of his Clapham home, pictured, was no bigger than a 10p coin

Rather comically, the braver postman had added his own comment to his colleague's note which said: 'WHAT!'

Today, Royal Mail apologised for any inconvenience Mr Roberston-Reed had suffered and added: 'Alternative arrangements should have been made.'

An expert has confirmed that this arachnid is a common garden spider - and not one of thousands of poisonous spiders currently plaguing Britain.

Greg Hitchcock of Kent Wildlife Trust said: 'This is a Common garden spider, Araneus diadematus.

'[They are] common and widespread. Very noticeable this time of year as the large females are at their biggest and sitting in the middle of their webs.'

The postman is not the first - and probably won't be the last - to refuse to make a delivery.

Heather Rogers, 63, did not receive regular mail deliveries for months because pigeon droppings made it too slippery for postal staff to deliver to her home.

The animals would gather on top of a wall close to her Cornwall home and regularly splatter the path with droppings.

At the time, a Royal Mail spokesman said: 'We suspended delivery to two addresses in October 2012, because the postman delivering there reported broken glass and a slippery, slimy surfaceÂ  on the path in the narrow alleyway.

'We informed the customers of the suspension and told them we would be contacting the local authority to request cleaning work be carried out in the alleyway.'

In February, residents of 90 homes in Salford were sent a letter warning them their post has been temporarily suspended for health and safety reasons after two postmen were confronted by one dog.

Mr Robertson-Reed is not the first to experience a late delivery.

Heather Rogers, 63, did not receive 
regular mail deliveries for a month because pigeon droppings made it too 
slippery for postal staff to reach her home in Cornwall. Once the mess was cleared three weeks later, the service resumed.

Overzealous Royal Mail health and safety officers ruled in November last year that the uneven paving slabs on two roads in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, were too dangerous for their postmen to negotiate. The residents had to make a six-mile round trip to a local delivery office to collect their post - and were told to speak to the Land Registry about the issue.

Royal Mail suspended deliveries to one street in Elgin, northern Scotland, after a flock of unfriendly seagulls launched a series of 'swooping attacks' on one postman. The organisation said at the time they would resume their service 'as soon as it was safe to do so.'

Around 90 residents of a Salford, Manchester, estate were sent a letter by Royal Mail warning them their post had been suspended temporarily because of an aggressive dog.
