Read Martin Samuel's take on the Messi and Ronaldo debate 

Lionel Messi is a 'bigger genius' than Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, according to Fabio Capello.

The Real Madrid star made it a hat-trick of wins in the FIFA awards gala in Zurich on Monday, beating Messi to the coveted prize. 

However, Capello reckons Barcelona ace Messi, who won the gong FOUR years in a row, is a better player as speculation over his future at the Camp Nou rumbles on.

The Italian told COPE: 'Can Ronaldo win more Ballons d'Or than Messi? It's a very interesting battle. Messi is a bigger genius than Ronaldo, but he is having some problems at his club and that could cause some problems.

'Cristiano is very solid and mentally very strong. He wants to become the best ever and plays in an amazing team.

'All his team-mates help him and he in turn helps out the team as well. It's crucial to have the respect of all your team-mates and to always train well.'

Barcelona must keep hold of Messi as speculation over his future rumbles on

Messi still has three years to run on his contract at Barcelona but has been linked with a move away.

However, former Three Lions chief Capello insists they must pull out all the stops to keep the Argentine in Spain. 

He added: 'Barcelona should never sell Messi. How can you sell someone like Messi?

'I saw him play at the weekend. He didn't have a good start and did not seem to be enjoying himself. And then all of a sudden he awoke and put in a superb performance. Barcelona simply cannot sell a player like him.'
