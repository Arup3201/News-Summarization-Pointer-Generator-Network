If this is what a dry spell looks like then Jose Mourinho can probably rest easy, but he should not get too comfortable. There will be harder days ahead, especially if his side produce many more performances like this one.

Not that it was dreadful. How could it be when they won 2-0 and did not face a single shot on goal?

But that’s not to say it was impressive. They led through Eden Hazard inside six minutes and after 10 minutes Hull had lost Michael Dawson to injury. 

It was not until the 67th minute, when Diego Costa scored their second goal after Tom Huddlestone was shown a red card for a dreadful tackle, that they looked comfortable.

Even then there was a lingering ‘what if’, one that was posed so passionately by Steve Bruce when he weighed up Chris Foy’s odd decision not to book Gary Cahill for diving in the second half. Having already been shown a yellow card in the opening period, the England centre-half was extremely lucky not to be dismissed for his tumble when it was still 11 v 11 and 1-0 to Chelsea.

But a win is a win, as they say. Mourinho certainly wasn’t trumpeting it as anything else, saying: ‘I have to agree - we have had many special performances this season and in this we just had moments. Not for 90 minutes.’

This was the sort of day where Mourinho had only pragmatic thoughts. When asked why he was snubbed for the manager of the month award, he said: ‘I promise you that what I tell you is true - I don't care. But there is something that is not right because, in four years in the Premier League, I've won the manager of the month twice. So, for sure, they don't like me. But I don't care. I just want my team to win.’

That much they achieved, sweeping away in the process some of the doubting looks that came their way after the club’s recent struggles in the north-east, either side of a win against Tottenham. Not that four points from three games ought to constitute a crisis when set against Hull’s run of nine games without a win.

But there are worries for Mourinho, namely what happens when Cesc Fabregas is not available. His ban for this game was somewhat offset by the return of Nemanja Matic, a wonderfully significant cog in this machine.

But John Obi Mikel made up the numbers next to Matic in front of the defence and the combination simply is not as creative or fluent as when Matic and Fabregas play together. The tempo is evidently not the same when they are separated.

Perhaps that is why Diego Costa was often so subdued when this was still a match between equal numbers. He had not scored in his previous four appearances and barely made a dent on Hull’s defence in the first half. Often, the supply line just was not functioning.

With due credit to Hull, they steadied themselves well after a dreadful start littered with misfortune.

They were behind after only six minutes and had good cause to appeal for a foul in the build-up to Hazard’s headed opener. Mikel had won possession in the middle of the pitch, but replays showed he took more than a bit of Sone Aluko’s foot in the process. No whistle came, Matic spread the play to Oscar on the left and his excellent cross found Hazard. His header meant eight goals this season for a man closing in on a £200,000 a week contract.

Mourinho said: ‘He didn't play against Sporting Lisbon in midweek. I gave him four days holiday. He went with his family to a weather where he can take his shirt (off) and get some sun. Then, in return, he said he'd come back fresh. He came back with that happiness in his legs.’

Dawson then left the pitch after injuring his hamstring and what was already a tough fixture looked far harder. Somehow, the walloping never happened; Hazard’s goal was the only shot on target in the half.

The second half was fairly even until the second of two refereeing incidents. First, Cahill escaped a booking for diving after a David Meyler challenge – he had already been booked for a bad foul on Sone Aluko - and then Tom Huddlestone was sent off for an awful tackle on Filipe Luis after an hour.

Within seven minutes Chelsea were two up. Hazard did much of the work, exchanging passes with Branislav Ivanovic before threading a pass to Costa whose slow roll across and past Allan McGregor was perfect.

It was a rare moment of class on a scrappy day.
