A couple who held hands as they jumped off George Washington Bridge together may have killed the woman's uncle before their joint suicide plunge.

Gary Crockett, 41, and Nickie Circelli, 40, both of Suffern, New York, died after jumping into the Hudson River about 11:20 a.m. on Monday.

And now their deaths have been linked to that of Circelli's uncle in Suffern, according to a source.

Gary Crockett, 41, and Nickie Circelli, 40, both of Suffern, N.Y.,  died after jumping into the Hudson River span about 11:20 a.m. on Monday

The couple were reportedly living in Suffern with Circelli's elderly uncle, who was found dead inside the home on Monday afternoon.

His body was discovered along with a note implicating Crockett and Circelli in his murder.

Police believe the uncle discovered that the pair had stolen money from another relative and had threatened to turn them in.

Their death has been linked to that of Nickie Circelli's (pictured) uncle in Suffern on Monday

He had a broken vertebra in his neck.

A neighbor told the New York Daily News that she heard a loud 'boom' from Circelli’s relative’s flat on Monday night.

Josefina Rodriguez, 42, lives in an apartment above Circelli’s uncle said:  'In the morning I didn’t hear him cough,' she added, referring to the victim.

'He always coughed. And every day I heard his truck. When I didn’t hear his truck, I thought something must be wrong.'

She said Circelli’s uncle was found dead on Monday afternoon by his business partner - they owned a catering business.

Investigators found a letter in which the couple apologized for their actions, a source told the New York Daily News.

The couple did not have identification on them when they were pulled from the water so the letter was a crucial piece of evidence that enabled investigators to identify them.

A woman who said she had been a friend of the couple, Heather Becraft of Sloatsburg, N.Y.,  said Circelli had children who live in another part of New York State with their father.

She said they 'were very much in love' but had been having problems that she did not disclose, reported North Jersey.com.

Another friend, who asked not to be identified, told the website that the couple struggled with drug addiction.

The deputy mayor of Suffern, Jo Meegan-Corrigan, said on Tuesday night that a man’s body was found at the home where the couple lived on Washington Avenue.

She declined to provide more details, saying she 'would like to give the family time to gather themselves.'

Port Authority spokesman Joseph Pentangelo said workers on the lower level of the bridge saw an object go by them at about 11:20 a.m. When they looked down, they saw the man and the woman in the water

The pair, who both had a criminal record, were seen walking on the bridge together, from the Hudson River near 125th St. at about 12:10 p.m., officials said.

Port 
Authority spokesman Joseph Pentangelo said workers on the lower level of
 the bridge saw an object go by them at about 11:20 a.m. When they 
looked down, they saw the man and the woman in the water.

Workers had seen the pair along the walkway moments earlier before hearing a splash.

They were in critical condition after 
NYPD units pulled them from the Hudson River and took them to  Mount Sinai St. Luke’s hospital in Manhattan where they died.
