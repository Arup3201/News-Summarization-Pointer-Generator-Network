Alan Irvine has refused to rethink his strategy of protecting fast-rising star Saido Berahino in the wake of West Brom's Capital One Cup capitulation at Bournemouth.

The Albion boss defended making 10 changes to the side that scrambled a 2-2 Barclays Premier League draw with Crystal Palace on Saturday in spite of the 2-1 defeat at Dean Court three days later.

Irvine left star striker Berahino, Stephane Sessegnon and Georgios Samaras on the bench on Tuesday night, and paid the price as Bournemouth booked their first-ever League Cup quarter-final.

The Baggies manager is determined not to overuse Berahino, especially through the hectic Christmas schedule, and risk leaving the 21-year-old physically and mentally spent come the new year.

'Saido's getting a lot of attention at the moment, he's being asked to do a lot as well,' said Irvine.

'They are away playing international games as well, and it's a big ask.

'I'm sure Albion fans would be bitterly disappointed if Saido Berahino were to be suddenly injured because we weren't looking after him.

'It's managing the whole situation, we have a squad of players who will need to be ready and will be used over the coming weeks.

Berahino has stated the season in excellent form, scoring eight times for West Brom in 12 appearances

Berahino also played a vital part in England Under 21's qualification for next summer's European Championship

'We've got an extremely busy period not too far from now, and must handle that very carefully.

'We went Monday and then Saturday, and then to ask them to go Tuesday and Saturday would have been a big ask.'

England boss Roy Hodgson launched a long-running storm by revealing Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling had complained of tiredness during recent Euro 2016 qualifiers.

Albion boss Irvine had no qualms admitting his own players have voiced troubles with top-flight schedules though, vowing not to put any of his squad at risk.

West Brom take on Leicester at the King Power Stadium in a return to Premier League action on Saturday, with Irvine bound to recall all his big guns.

Despite missing out on a League Cup quarter-final he insisted he had been right to change his line-up, criticising his fringe players for failing to play their way into his regular selection plans.

'I've had players coming to me and saying they were tired, and these are guys who want to play and want to win things,' said Irvine.

'They are right to say how they feel and they are right to raise it with me.

'When you have senior, committed and focused players telling you they are feeling the schedule, then you have to listen and respond.

'We will need to use all our squad over the coming weeks and months, and you need to have as many people fit and fresh as possible.

'Players had chances out there and some didn't take them, but we have to keep pushing on.

'When players come in and play well the squad looks like it has depth, but when they come in and don't play well it starts to look a bit thin.

'They are all capable, but some of them didn't show it at Bournemouth.'
