A photographer is taking pictures of dead animals which look like they are happily sleeping to help owners deal with their loss.

In one image, a dog is captured lying on chair in the garden comforted by a rug and a book. 

In another, a cat looks content wrapped up in warm in a baby pink blanket.

Emir Ozsahin said when he lost a close friend it made him think about 
death and ways in which he could use photography to help him and others 
through a difficult time.

His friend was killed in a road accident and she was just 19. 

Mr Ozsahin said: 'I couldn't get out of my head the image of her body covered with newspapers.

'While I was trying to get rid of this image, I realised that the image of her alive was fading away as well. 

'Her last photograph shouldn't have been like that. Or I shouldn't have seen that photograph.'

He said the project focuses on how the people the animals leave behind want to remember them. 

'I
 worked with animals, and because they are really close to humans, they 
feel like us. And we humanise them as our human born babies.

'With
 the frames I will try to create, it's about how my subconscious 
processes them, about the reality we know and how we try to forget what 
happens after death.'

He contacted several vets asking them to tell their patients about his work. 

To create the project he ordered pieces of mini furniture to fit the animals including a tiny bathtub for the Kingfisher bird. 

The photos were taken in his parent's garden in Istanbul. 

An adult cat photographed on the wooden highchair belonged to an elderly lady.

'I was really shocked when I learned that an older woman would want to have her cat's picture taken.

'I always thought elderly people would have second thoughts about the idea of this project.

All of the other animals were sadly from the streets or animal shelters and could not be cured.

The photographer said: 'So it was more touching that way, they died on the streets or from an illness all alone.'

After completing the project he buried the animals himself and says the photographs act as a memorial to the animals that passed.

He said: 'By humanising deceased animals and showing them as if they were sleeping, I tried to briefly touch death and create a series of photographs about pushing away the feeling of disappearing before it hits us hard in the face.

'I'm seriously not sure if this is an escape or an acceptance for me. All I know is that the photographs have a positive effect on me.'
