A court in Egypt has sentenced to death seven Christians for taking part in an anti-Islam film Innocence of Muslims, which caused international riots when it was published online.

The Christian Egyptians, including the film’s maker, are all located in the United States and were tried in their absence by a Cairo court.

During the trial, the judges were shown 
clips of the low-budget film and footage of 
Muslim protesters in Libya outraged by the film, the official MENA news 
agency reported.

Egyptian courts usually hand out the 
maximum punishment - execution in this case for a blasphemy verdict - 
and send the decision to the state’s top Islamic scholar to get his 
approval, which is always granted.

If the defendants do return to Egypt, they could get a new trial.

Attack: The US embassy in Benghazi was raided on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks

Deadly: Four people died, including US Ambassador Christopher Stevens, during an assault on the US Consulate in Benghazi, Libya

The movie, in which Mohammed is depicted as a buffoon and paedophile, had catastrophic results.

Unrest linked to the film, which is thought to have only been publicly shown in the US once, began in September when a 13-minute trailer was dubbed into Arabic and posted on to YouTube.

The release of the film online set off a
firestorm in the Middle East, with Muslims throughout the region taking
to the streets and staging violent protests against the U.S.

Tragic: John Christopher Stevens is the first US Ambassador to be killed by violence overseas since 1979. He apparently died of smoke inhalation after the attack on the consulate in Benghazi

Victims: Sean Smith (left), 34, was a foreign 
service computer expert who had previously been posted to Baghdad. Glen 
Doherty, 42, was a former US Navy SEAL who was working as a private 
security contractor

Despite his lengthy association with 
extremists, including the 9/11 mastermind and al-Qaeda leader himself, 
the military recommended in a 2005 report sending him back to his home 
country of Libya.

U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens was 
killed in the deadly assault on the Libya compound.

Mr Stevens was the first US ambassador to die in the line of duty since 1979.

It is believed that the attack, which 
occurred on the 11th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, was a 
planned ambush carried out by terrorists using a pro-Islam protest as 
cover.

Three other Americans - Sean Smith, Tyron Woods and Glen Doherty - also perished in the assault.

Unrest also spread across north Africa and parts of the Middle East, major protests broke out in Pakistan, the Philippines and Indonesia, while smaller demonstrations also took place in Yemen, the West Bank and Azerbaijan.

Demonstrators in Afghanistan torched a
U.S. flag and were heard shouting slogans denouncing America during a 
protest in the city of Herat.

Wrecked: The consulate was badly damaged in the attack that forced US personnel to flee

Extremists: The Libyan government blamed the attack on Islamic extremists angry over the release of a trailer for an American anti-Islam movie

A similar scene was captured in 
Turkey, where a group of about 50 protesters set a mock American flag on
fire near the U.S. embassy in Ankara.

Egyptian protesters scaled the walls of the US embassy in Cairo to replace the Stars and Stripes with an Islamic banner.

Meanwhile in Egypt's highest appeal 
courts suspended their work today to protest presidential decrees that 
gave the country's Islamist leader Mohammed Morsi nearly absolute 
powers, state television reported, deepening the turmoil roiling the 
country since the decrees were announced last week.

A
widening dispute between the president and the nation's judiciary is at
the center of the uproar over a constitutional declaration placing 
Morsi above oversight of any kind, including by the courts.

Clashes: Riot police and protesters throw stones at one another during clashes near Tahrir Square today

Tension: Police fired tear gas into Cairo's Tahrir Square, where several hundred protesters spent the night after a mass rally to denounce President Mohamed Morsi's assumption of expanded powers

At least 200,000 protesters filled 
Cairo's central Tahrir Square on Tuesday to denounce the decrees and 
call on the president to rescind them.

Judges with the high and lower courts
of appeal decided that they will not return to work until Morsi 
rescinds his decrees, according to state TV. Many of the country's 
courts already had stopped functioning due to individual strikes.

The high court of appeal is led by 
Mohammed Mumtaz Metwali, who also chairs the Supreme Judiciary Council, 
which oversees the nation's court system. Members of the council met 
Morsi on Monday to discuss his decrees.

A
ruling, regardless of which way it goes, would constitute a direct 
challenge to Morsi, who took office in June as Egypt's first freely 
elected president but has enraged pro-democracy activists who claim he 
is acting too much like the authoritarian leader he replaced.

The court also denounced Morsi's claim that it was part of a 'conspiracy' against him.

'The
allegation that the (June) ruling was reached in complicity with others
to bring down elected state institutions and consequently the state's 
collapse ... is incorrect and untrue,' the constitutional court said in a
statement read by its deputy chairman, Maher Sami, in a televised news 
conference.

'But what is most saddening for the court's judges came when the president of the republic joined, in a painful and cruel surprise, the continuing attacks against the constitutional court,' it said, alluding to comments made by Morsi on Friday in which he said the June ruling was leaked ahead of its official announcement.

Unrest: Egyptian opponents of President Mohamed Morsi clash with anti-riot security forces, in Tahrir square

A strike by the appeals courts and the rare criticism of the president in the Supreme Constitutional Court's statement came a day after Egyptians poured into Tahrir Square - the epicenter of last year's anti-Mubarak uprising - to protest Morsi's decrees, which also gave him unlimited powers to 'protect' the nation.

Clashes between some protesters and police continued Wednesday off Tahrir, near the U.S. Embassy.

The liberal opposition has said it would not enter a dialogue with the president about the country's latest political crisis before Morsi rescinded his decrees. Activists planned another massive rally on Friday.
