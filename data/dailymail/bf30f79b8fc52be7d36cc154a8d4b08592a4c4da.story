Support: Royal Marine Sergeant Alexander Blackman's wife and mother have defended their son and argued he should be released

The wife of a Royal Marine jailed for life for murdering a wounded Taliban insurgent in Afghanistan says he 'bitterly regrets' the killing and should be released because 'he poses no threat to society'.

Sergeant Alexander Blackman, 39, is serving at least ten years after being found guilty of killing the severely wounded captive in Afghanistan.

Last year a court martial board found Blackman - known as 'Marine A' during the trial - guilty of murdering the insurgent who had been seriously injured in an attack by an Apache helicopter in Helmand more than two years ago.

The killing was captured on a camera on his helmet and afterwards he told two men with him: 'Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention.'

His family has told a documentary to be broadcast tonight that he was doing 'what he was sent out to do'.

His wife Claire Blackman, 42, from Taunton, Somerset, told the BBC: 'He does bitterly regret it but hindsight is a wonderful thing.

'There were so many other factors embroiled in that decision. He was in charge of all of those other lads who were in a really, really dangerous situation.

'They didn't know who else was around on the ground. They had an insurgent who had clearly had explosives on him in their midst.

'The trouble is we are trying very hard 
to rationalise something that happened in a warzone, in a different 
country, on the other side of the world, in circumstances that none of 
us will ever begin to understand.

'Bottom line, Al is no risk to society.'

Blackman's mother Frances has also told a BBC One documentary to be broadcast on tonight that her son was doing his job.

She said: 'In my letters I write to him, I always put "I am very proud of you son, you haven’t disgraced yourself, you haven’t disgraced us".'

She added: 'He was doing his duty to the country, and everybody in this country and the Queen and that’s what he was sent out to do, to get rid of the insurgents.'

His sister, Melody, said: 'I’ll love him no matter what and I know he’s had to make different choices that I wouldn’t want to have to make personally, but it’s war'.

After his sentencing on December 6, Blackman said he was 'devastated' at being handed a life sentence.

Footage: Before a video of the murder came to light, Blackman was being considered for promotion to Colour Sergeant

He has said he feels ashamed at his actions, describing them as 'a stupid lack of self-control and lapse in judgment'

Two other Marines were acquitted. Charges against a further two were previously discontinued.

Blackman, who denied murder, had 15 years’ experience in the Royal Marines, having joined in 1998, and was in charge of Command Post Omar in Helmand during Operation Herrick 14 in 2011.

He has said he feels ashamed at his actions, describing them as 'a stupid lack of self-control and lapse in judgment'.

‘Marine A: Criminal or Casualty of War?’ is on BBC One at 10.35pm today.

The footage was captured by a camera mounted on the helmet of a Royal Marine in the aftermath of a helicopter attack in Helmand.

He shot the unknown insurgent in the 
chest but said he believed the man was already dead and he was taking 
out his anger on a corpse.

As the fighter lies on the floor convulsing and struggling for breath, Sgt Blackman tells him: 'There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil you c***. It’s nothing you wouldn’t do to us.'

He then turned to his comrades and said: 'Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention.'

Blackman is the first British serviceman to be found guilty of murder during combat since the Second World War.

Blackman completed tours of Iraq, 
Afghanistan and Northern Ireland during his military career, and before a
 video of the murder came to light, he was being considered for 
promotion to Colour Sergeant.
