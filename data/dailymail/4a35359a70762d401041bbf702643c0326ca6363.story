She was the nerdy feminist with an ‘awful haircut’ and ‘hideous Coke bottle glasses’.

He was a ‘Viking’ of a man with a six-inch beard who towered over everyone he met.

But this is this is how one of America’s greatest political dynasties began, according to the screenplay of Rodham, about the early life of Hillary Clinton.

The script, a copy of which has been 
shown to MailOnline by a Hollywood source, gives a riveting fictional 
account of how the former First Lady and future Presidential candidate 
met husband Bill - set to the soundtrack of Carly Simon’s You’re So 
Vain.

The way we were: Bill and Hillary pictured in their younger years after meeting at Yale in 1972

Hot politics: The script rather ungallanty says 'she¿s the valedictorian of the 'look-like-s*** school of feminism¿

There is romance and sex including one scene in which the pair ‘devour’ each other.

There is the ambition of the potential 2016 Presidential candidate who was chosen in her 20s to serve on the House Judiciary Committee which looked into impeaching President Richard Nixon.

But above all there is the story of somebody who refuses to let anything get in her way of getting to the top - man or woman.

MailOnline has been told by sources that the script has not yet received financial backing and is being extensively rewritten.

It is based on real events but screenwriter Young Il Kim, a South Korean who was living in New Jersey at the time he wrote it, has taken artistic licence when it comes to dialogue.

Love story: The screenplay Rodham tells how former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met husband, former president Bill Clinton

Mr Kim said the script was intended to show the ‘journey of a person who is faced with the impossible choice of her career ambitions and personal desires’.

He said: ‘This is a story about a woman who was a political rock star and had as bright a future coming out of Yale Law as Bill if not more.

‘And the story is about someone who is so assured of her destiny in Washington D.C. until she meets the one person in the world who makes her make this the most impossible dilemma. 

‘And she faces this difficult choice when she is 26 in 1974, in an era when most women realize that they cannot have both a career and a family.’

As a result, the story is as much about the relationship between Mr Clinton and Mrs Clinton, whose maiden name is Rodham, as it is about her ascent to the White House.

Beauty: Hillary Clinton, pictured as a student in 1969, several years before she met her husband Bill

Driven: Hillary, center, with fellow students at Wellesley in 1969, is described as having 'hideous Coke bottle glasses' in the screenplay

Don't mess: In the script, Hillary decides to stop wearing skirts and wears pant suits to be taken more seriously

The script details how the pair met at Yale College in 1972 in the law school library where she is tutoring a young Robert Reich, who would go on to be Labour Secretary in her husband’s administration.

Mrs Clinton is described as a ‘blonde girl whose face is hidden behind an awful haircut and a hideous pair of COKE-BOTTLE glasses’.

It reads: ‘Her tie-dyed T-shirt has a faded “AuH2O” on it. She’s the valedictorian of the 'look-like-s*** school of feminism.’

Mr Clinton is a ‘a VIKING of a man slows down to watch her. He has a full mane and a six-inch beard.’

The then Miss Rodham notices him gazing at her, slams her book shut and storms up to him to demand an explanation.

Her ‘piercing gaze’ leaves Mr Clinton speechless until the credits roll, set to the music of Carly Simon’s You’re So Vain.

Over the 118 pages the script details how the pair then drift apart and get back together until 1974 when she joins in him Arkansas where he is running for a seat in the House - having effectively chosen his career over hers.

Work in progress: The screenplay Rodham which focuses on the love story of Bill and Hillary Clinton has been written by Young Il Kim

On her journey she encounters all the travails of being a woman in a man’s world in the 1970s.

Mrs Clinton tells a friend that her friend Betsey Wright, who would go on to her her husband’s chief of staff, thinks she should change her appearance to give herself ‘torpedo titties’ to make herself more appealing.

She later decides to stop wearing skirts and wears pant suits to be taken more seriously.

Mr Clinton’s mother Virginia, however, disapproves of her attire so much that she gives her a tight-fitting blue dress to wear during a family visit.

Sexism even comes from Mr Clinton’s own family in the form of his half-brother Roger Clinton Jr, who raises a laugh at a family gathering with the joke: ‘Who do you think f***** more women? Bill or Hillary?’

The script describes how Mrs Clinton is outraged when her husband is first offered the job on the House Judiciary Committee by chairman John Doar instead of her.

He got the call while she was standing in the room and declined as he was entering politics himself.

In a screaming row she later tells him: ‘Your mother hates me. Your brother hates me. Your staff hates me. I want to go where I’m not hated, where I’m not a consolation prize!’

Passion: In one scene the pair 'devour' each other

She also tells a friend that he can ‘burn in hell’ as he is just ‘using me for the apartment’.

Outraged Mrs Clinton complains that he ‘isn’t even using me for sex’.

When asked if she really isn’t having sex with him, she says: ‘It depends upon what the meaning of the word “sex” means’.

But it is not all stormy waters, and there are scenes of intimacy between the two.

Mr Clinton first proposes in 1972 when Mrs Clinton is 26 and working for the Children’s Defence Fund, whilst he is assistant professor of law at the University of Arkansas.

In true Clinton style, he does it rather casually as the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew plays on a TV in the background.

Mr Kim writes that Mrs Clinton ‘wanted this for so long and it’s finally happening’ but does not seem to take it seriously or give him an answer.

He later proposes again in dramatic fashion as he is about to get on a plane but she cannot say yes, even when he puts the ring in front of her finger. 

Mr Kim writes: ‘She shakes, unable to speak. Her world crumbles in the most wonderful yet devastating way.

‘Her heart wants to say yes. But her mind calculates the ramifications. She doesn’t know.’

Mr Kim also writes of when they have sex Mr Clinton ‘eyes her with such intensity that she feels naked, vulnerable, and aroused all at once’.

Power couple: Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton on their wedding day, October 11, 1975 in Fayetteville, Arkansas

He writes: ‘A seductive, penetrating gaze that makes her want to explode with pent-up desires.

‘He grabs her wrists and pins her against the wall. Feeling so wonderfully submissive to his primal, masculine needs.

‘Bill tears off the buttons of her blouse. As he buries his head into her cleavage...’

Their attempt to have sex ends in a comic note when they check their voicemail messages which include the call from Mr Doar - sparking a row which ends the liaison.

The bulk of the script is about Mrs Clinton’s time on the Impeachment Committee and how she wins the approval of older, male colleagues by being brilliant at her job.

She is assigned to work with William Weld, a 28-year-old rising star who Mr Kim describes as having ‘golden hair, dashing good looks, and tall and muscular frame. He won the genetic lottery.’

Mrs Clinton jokingly compares him to Ryan O’Neal in Love Story and they almost kiss on the roof of the Congressional Hotel.

Instead they are interrupted by a phone call from Mr Clinton wishing her happy birthday. She is touched when he plays ‘Hail to the chief’ on the saxophone down the line, winning her heart again.

The pair then go from strength to strength, with Mr Clinton helping Mrs Clinton’s work by suggesting she subpoena President Nixon’s recordings from the Roosevelt Room.

She replies: ‘I f***** love you. I mean that. I love you and I want to f*** you’.

Mrs Clinton ignores him flirting with a waitress by using his stock line that the watermelons of Hope, Arkansas, his home town are the ‘firmest, juiciest melons’.

She looks the other way when a 20-year-old girl emerges out of his campaign office right in front of her with a smile on her face.

It is not until 1974 when she is in Arkansas helping Mr Clinton run for the House of Representatives against Republican incumbent John Paul Hammerschmidt that they fall out again because his campaign staff mocked her.

The script says that she was so furious that ‘everything about him and his world repulses her’.

Mrs Clinton tells him: ‘I really tried. I tried and tried. I thought I could make this work but I can’t. I can’t do this.

Mr Clinton says: ‘Then don’t. If you can’t handle the campaign, don’t.’

Mr Kim writes that her ‘heart breaks’ as she says: ‘I mean us’.

The scene ends with the song You Can’t Always Get What You Want by the Rolling Stones, suggesting they are over - but as history would show, the partnership would last.
