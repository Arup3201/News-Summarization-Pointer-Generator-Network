Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appeared to indicate that Iran would be prepared to stop high-grade uranium enrichment.

Ahmadinejad said he would meet the demand of the United States and its allies if world powers agreed to meet its needs for the fuel.

On his presidential website he said: 'From the beginning the Islamic Republic has stated that if European countries provided 20 percent enriched fuel for Iran, it would not enrich to this level.'

His comments coincide with the start today of world power talks over the Iranian nuclear programme.

The two day conference will discuss ending a decade-long stand-off over Tehran's nuclear programme which has become a serious source of potential military conflict in the Middle East.

World powers are pushing for the suspension of Iran's high-grade uranium enrichment activities over fears the country is trying to develop nuclear weapons, although Tehran denies the accusation.

Despite the latest offer, it unclear how much influence Ahmadinejad has over the negotiations, and whether his remarks reflect Tehran's position in the talks.

Experts and diplomats said a breakthrough was unlikely at the meeting in Moscow with the Iranians.

The international powers taking part are also wary of making concessions that would let Tehran draw out the talks and give it more time to develop a nuclear weapons capability.

Iran strenuously denies it has any wish to obtain such weaponry and says it only wants nuclear technology to generate electricity.

Israel has threatened to bomb Iran if no solution to the dispute is found. Oil markets are nervous over the prospect of intensifying regional tensions and the frail world economy can ill afford a further increase in crude prices.

A European Union spokesman said after the talks started: 'The atmosphere was fine, business-like and good.

'We hope this translates into a serious political commitment by the Iranians to address our proposals.'

But a Western official made clear the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany were ready to deepen Iran's diplomatic and economic isolation if no deal is reached.

He said: 'If Iran remains unwilling to take the opportunities these talks present, it will face continuing and intensified pressure and isolation.'

The Moscow talks follow two rounds of negotiations since diplomacy with Iran resumed in April following a 15-month hiatus.

The United States wants to halt Iran's enrichment of uranium to 20 percent purity, a level which some experts consider to be a dangerous step towards achieving the ability to create the explosive material required to make a nuclear bomb.

Ahmadinejad's comments on enrichment appeared intended to ease pressure from the world powers and encourage them to make concessions at the talks.

But the Iranian president, who stands down at elections next year, has fallen out of favour with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the man who has the ultimate decision-making power over the strategic nuclear programme.
