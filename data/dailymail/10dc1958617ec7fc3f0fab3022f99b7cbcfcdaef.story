The mother of a three-year-old taken to Syria by his father to fight for ISIS has begged the terror group to send her son home, saying she 'never stops thinking about him'.

Lidia Herrera issued the tearful plea on an Italian talk show after images of her son Ismail, 3, wearing a black headband and carrying an AK-47 were posted online by accounts linked to ISIS.

The boy's father, Ismar Mesinovic, was killed fighting in Aleppo in September, but Miss Herrera had not heard from or seen her son for a year until the picture emerged.

Lidia Solana Herrera says this image shared on social media accounts linked to ISIS terrrorists shows her son Ismail, who was taken by his father to Syria last year to fight for the terror group

Miss Herrera (pictured on an Italian talk show) says she thinks about her son every day and hopes he will be returned to her,and has begged ISIS to return him to her

Speaking to TV programme Ano Uno, she said: 'I never stop thinking about him; whether he is cold, whether he’s hungry, if he needs me. He is small. He needs his mother.

'I beg these people to let me speak to him, to see a photo. Without him I don’t know what I am going to do.’

In a separate interview with Il Giornale she added: 'I want him back in my arms. In the name of Allah give me back my son. 

'They say they are real believers but what they are doing is wrong. It is not right to tear a child away from its mother.

'I hope that they look into their hearts and think about me a mother who is desperately searching for her son. Even if my husband told them to raise him I am his mother and I love Ismail like every mum in the world.' 

Miss Herrera says she had no idea her husband was a radical, saying he talked about women and children being killed in Syria, but did not seem angry about it

Miss Herrera made a tearful appeal for Ismail's (pictured) return on Italian TV, saying she thinks about him all the time 'whether he is cold, whether he’s hungry, if he needs me'

The heartbreaking image shows Ismail wearing a black headband inscribed with Arabic writing while walking across a battle-scarred landscape holding the hand of an unknown man. 

While it is not known when exactly the image was taken, this man is unlikely to be the boy's father as he is believed to have been killed during fighting in September. 

ISIS sees children as central to its mission to create a Caliphate in the Middle East, and has long actively recruited youngsters.

Children are indoctrinated into a life of violence early, often witnessing executions, and are encouraged to stage mock beheadings using toys.

Fighters will often post images of their youngest recruits, which they refer to as 'cubs', and Islamic state Twitter feeds promote services offered to children, such as free healthcare and schooling.

Miss Herrera lives in the northern Italian town of Belluno, but originally comes from Cuba.

She was raised as a Catholic but converted to Islam 'out of love for my husband', who comes from Bosnia and has family in Germany.

She said she often visits her family back in Cuba, and added  it was not unusual for her husband to care for the child while she went away. 

So when she handed her son over last year, she had no idea Ismail would be taken to Syria.

She added: I never had the faintest suspicion my husband was a terrorist.

‘I remember he was very upset by the massacres in Syria. He always watched the reports on TV about the war. 

'He would talk to me about women and children who were killed but he seemed normal. I could never have imagined that he would go to Aleppo to die.

‘He would go to the mosque but when he came back he was completely normal. 

'He never spoke to me about recruiters who came to talk to him. If he had done I would never have let him take the little one away.

“When I knew they had left for Syria it was like everything around me fell apart. My little one in Syria...You can only imagine how a mother feels in front of news like that.” 

Miss Herrera says she had no idea that her estranged husband, who is now believed to have been killed in the fighting, was a terrorist (file image of a fighter holding the ISIS flag)

According to La Repubblica anti-terrorism police and secret service officers are now investigating the boy's disappearance.

They are believed to be probing a group of Islamists who operate in the northern Veneto region, along with a notorious imam, Bilal Bosnic who is accused of recruiting many of Italy’s jihadis.

Miss Herrera added: 'I never had the faintest suspicion my husband was a terrorist. When I knew they had left for Syria it was like everything around me fell apart.

'My little one in Syria...You can only imagine how a mother feels in front of news like that.'
