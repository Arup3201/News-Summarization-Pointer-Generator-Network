A gas explosion at a restaurant in Qatar has killed 12 people, including two children, emergency services in the country said today.

The blast happened shortly after 10am this morning at a Turkish restaurant near Landmark Mall in the capital Doha, and left 30 more people suffering serious injuries.

Preliminary investigations suggest a faulty gas canister inside the restaurant may be to blame, with the explosion causing a fire that led to part of the building near a petrol station collapsing.

Blast: The explosion happened shortly after 10am this morning at a Turkish restaurant near Landmark Mall in the capital Doha. It left 12 people dead - at least two of them children

Deadly: A security source added that at least two Asian children are believe to have died and said investigations continue to look into what caused the gas tank to explode

Major General Saad bin Jassim al-Khalifi, Qatar's head of public 
security, said 'Arabs, Asians and one Qatari' were among the dead and 
wounded.

'It was a very big blast...It blew away cars and the shrapnel scattered 50 or 100 meters away,' he said.

A
 security source added that at least two Asian children are believe to 
have died and said investigations continue to look into what caused the 
gas tank to explode.

Qatar's Ministry of Interior, which is 
responsible for police and emergency operations, said on its official 
Twitter feed that the blast has led to all roads in the area being shut down due to the risk posed by the proximity of the petrol station.

Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser al-Thani, confirmed there had been an explosion in remarks to state television.

Roads around the blast site have been closed due to the restaurant's proximity to the QNB petrol station

'Some deaths occurred that were announced, and there will be a press conference through the Ministry of Interior to give more information about the incident,' said Sheikh Abdullah, who is also interior minister.

Asked if security regulations would be tightened up after the incident, he replied that 'safety precautions are all there and the precautions for civil defence are there.'

The area around the Istanbul 
restaurant is on the outskirts of the capital near Landmark mall, a 
well-known shopping complex usually busy area with families.

From
 Hamad hospital, Abdul-Rahman Abdul-Kareem, an Indian driver who was 
eating in a restaurant nearby, told Reuters: 'I have too much damage 
now, my legs are broken and my head is open.'

Hamad Medical Corporation, which manages eight hospitals in the country as well as the national ambulance service, put out a call for blood donations on social media shortly after the blast

Hamad Medical Corporation, which manages eight hospitals in the country as well as the national ambulance service, put out a call for blood donations on social media shortly after the blast.

They said all blood from all groups were desperately needed.

The star-run Qatar TV aired pictures of damaged cars and smoke rising from near a gas station close to the shopping center.

Injured bystanders were seen being wheeled to ambulances on stretchers while police officers examined the scene.

The explosion is the worst in the country since May 2012, when nineteen foreign nationals - including 13 children - were killed in a fire at another Doha mall.

A member of Qatar's ruling family was among five people sentenced to prison by a court last year for negligence over the fire.

The blaze was caused by faulty wiring in Doha's Villagio Mall and quickly spread to a nursery, the court found.

Qatar is a small, wealthy Gulf Arab state with abundant reserves of natural gas that will play host to the 2022 World Cup.

The OPEC member state is generally safe, with little violent crime or civil unrest.
