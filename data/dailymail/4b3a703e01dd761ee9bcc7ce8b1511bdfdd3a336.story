Older people with Alzheimer's disease are less likely to develop cancer, and those with cancer are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s, scientists have discovered.

A study of more than 200,000 people - the largest of its kind - showed the risk of an Alzheimer’s patient developing cancer was half that of an elderly person without the condition.

They also found that having cancer made a person 35 per cent less likely to develop Alzheimer’s.

It's hoped discovering the links between the two conditions could lead to better understanding of both.

The researchers also hope it could open the door to the development of new therapies.

Dr Massimo Musicco said: ‘Since the number of cases of both Alzheimer's disease and cancer increase exponentially as people age, understanding the mechanisms behind this relationship may help us better develop new treatments for both diseases.’

His researchers looked at 204,468 Italians over 60 during a six-year period during which time 21,451 developed cancer and 2,832 Alzheimer's.

A total of 161 had both diseases whereas that number would have been expected to be 281 for cancer and 246 for Alzheimer's when considering how often they occur in the general population.

Dr Musicco, of the National Research Council of Italy in Milan, said: ‘While other studies have noted this relationship before, this is the largest study to date.

‘It has several strengths over previous studies, such as looking for the presence of the second disease both before and after the first disease was diagnosed.

‘This controls for the possibility the presence of one disease might obscure the diagnosis of other diseases because any new symptoms might be interpreted as a consequence of the already-diagnosed disease, or in the case of cancer, people might assume memory problems were a side-effect of chemotherapy.’

The researchers found the same result in people who died during the course of the study as well as those still living - controlling for the possibility the reduced life expectancy for the first disease would also reduce the likelihood of living to develop the second.
