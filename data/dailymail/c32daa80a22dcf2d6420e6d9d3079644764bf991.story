Cristiano Ronaldo has been likened to former basketball superstar Michael Jordan by overwhelmed Elche coach Fran Escriba.

The Real Madrid forward took his La Liga tally to nine goals in four games this season following another four strikes in the 5-1 hammering of Elche on Tuesday.

Escriba could only praise the Portuguese after the game and drew comparisons with Jordan who dominated basketball in the 1980-1990s, winning six NBA championships, and five MVP awards.

'Ronaldo is an extraordinary player with tremendous scoring ability,' Escriba told reporters.

'This is like when Michael Jordan was playing and scored 50 points every night.

'And on top of that he got two penalties. He doesn't need the help.

'It was a very tough game. We couldn't get anything from here or Barcelona.
