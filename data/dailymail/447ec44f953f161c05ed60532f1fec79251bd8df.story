Does axed Crystal Palace boss Neil Warnock appear in the 'who said it' round? It would be a shock if he didn't

1) 'I have just awarded myself a new five-year contract. I'm using the power while I can.'

2) 'This is not the best league in the world, this is football from the 19th Century. The only other thing I could bring was a Black and Decker to destroy the wall.'

3) ‘I called the players into the dressing room at 10am and told them how disappointed I was. The players were how you would expect them to be. Quiet but respectful. It was the first time I’d ever had to give a speech like that. Never before in my career.'

4) 'I lost my balance, making my body unstable and falling on top of my opponent. At that moment I hit my face against the player leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth.'

5) 'I have twins at home and 25 babies at work.'

6) Do I feel like I’m wearing a permanent gag? I am looking forward to going back on Talksport and BT after I’ve retired, when you can say what you want and enjoy it.'

7) 'He's not injured. He's not fit. He's not fit to play football unfortunately. He played in a reserve game the other day and I could have run about more than he did. I can't protect people who don't want to run and train, and are about three stone overweight.'

8) 'The last 18 months we have been on a magic carpet ride of development but we still have a lot of growth to make. The natural progression of the team, probably in the summer, has been challenged. We obviously lost a world-class player but our challenge now is to progress.'

9) At the start of the season, when asked if Liverpool were stronger without Luis Suarez, which player replied: 'I think so, with the players we have brought in. No disrespect to Luis - he's a great player and he'll be missed - but we move on from that.'

10) After being voted his country's second-greatest sportsman of all time, who said: 'Thank you but to finish second is like finishing last. On that list I would have been No 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, with due respect to the others.'
