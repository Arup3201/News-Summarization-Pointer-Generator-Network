This is the horrific picture of a young boy in hospital after a giant firework only used in professional displays blew up in his face.

The unnamed child, 10, and Dale Scott, 11, were playing with the 'Onion Bomb' in Salford, Greater Manchester when another youngster lit it and ran off.

They both suffered serious burns to their faces and hands and ran home in terror to get help.

The mother of the 10-year-old, who has not been named, released a picture of her son as a warning to others.

Dale's mother Vicky Stephenson, 43, from Prestwich has called for fireworks to be banned after rushing her son to hospital.

'Fireworks should be banned. They need to stop coming into the country because they are just so dangerous,' he said.

'Dale was outside a shop doing ‘penny for a guy’ with his mates when I went to the shops. Next thing I knew he was ringing me screaming saying a firework exploded and he’d burnt his face.

'He was hysterical with the pain and they put him on morphine when we got to the hospital. He’s lost his hair, eyebrows and eyelashes and got burns on his hands, his skin is peeling off.'

A relative of the 10-year-old victim, who has not yet been named, said: 'He shouldn’t have been playing with them but young lads shouldn’t be able to get hold of the fireworks in the first place. We need to find out who’s been selling them and put a stop to it.

'He came running back home screaming and with these horrific burns to his face. Thankfully the doctors think he’s going to be okay but it’s been really traumatic for him.'

Fire crews were called to Cumbrae Gardens at around midday yesterday.

An investigation is now under way to find out how the children ended up with the ‘Onion Bomb’.

Station manager Dave Hughes said: “We were told they were holding an industrial firework, another child lit it and it blew up in their face.

'An incident like this really brings home how dangerous fireworks are and it’s heartbreaking for all those involved. We need parents to know where their children are and make sure they are not playing with fireworks. There are many organised events taking place in Greater Manchester this weekend, please enjoy fireworks safely by going to one of them.'
