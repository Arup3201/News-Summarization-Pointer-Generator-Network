A high school Spanish teacher has had her sexy secret revealed - she once posed naked for Playboy.

Cristy Nicole Deweese, 21, featured in the magazine three years ago when she was just 18 as 'Coed of the Month'.

Miss Deweese, who teaches Spanish at Townview Magnet High School in Dallas, Texas, has caused outrage among parents this week over her raunchy past.

Miss Deweese's sexy shots are available for all to see online - including the teenage boys she currently teaches.

Among her pictures are full-frontal naked shots, photos of her wearing 'winter bunny gear' and lingerie, a simulated lesbian sex scene and a 'Naked Outdoors' gallery.

In a behind-the-scenes video clip from the photoshoot, when asked about her hobbies, the teenager says: 'Hunting, shooting... I shot me a buck last year.'

She adds that she is majoring in Spanish and 'going to be a Spanish teacher'.

One parent, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Dallas Morning News, that although her Playboy past should not prevent Miss Deweese from being a teacher, it did affect the way she is viewed by some students.

Another added: 'Are her male 16- and 17-year-old students looking at her without picturing her nude?

'And for the female students, is this someone they can respect as an educator, someone that they can look up to?'

The Dallas school district would not comment on Miss Deweese's pictures, saying that it was a 'personnel matter'.

She was not employed by the school district at the time the pictures were taken.
