Asda boss Andy Clarke says that shoppers are switching to vegetarian meals in the wake of the horse meat scandal

Shoppers have abandoned hamburgers and steak and switched to vegetarian meals in the wake of the horse meat scandal, the boss of Asda has revealed.

Speaking for the first time since it emerged the firm served up horse meat in own-brand products, chief executive Andy Clarke admitted: ‘Consumers have switched to veggie meals.

‘Meat free products have also seen a lift.

‘In overall terms there has been a small impact to meat sales.’

Asda was dragged into the scandal last week when it found 4.8per cent horsemeat in its fresh Chilled Beef Bolognese Sauce, while four types of its frozen beefburgers were positive for traces of equine DNA.

It has also withdrawn another 35 own-label and big brand lines, including fresh sauces, burgers and even diced pork, as a precaution.

Mr Clarke said he ‘felt a responsibility’ as Chief Executive for the scandal which had engulfed the UK’s second biggest supermarket chain.

But when asked whether he would be waving his annual bonus in light of the revelations he said: ‘We will pay all of our colleagues a bonus this year.’

Mr Clarke said he has been shocked at the horse meat revelations, but rejected claims that a drive to keep prices down had encouraged suppliers to cut corners.

‘There’s no excuse for something criminal happening in the supply chain,’ he said. ‘It’s fundamentally wrong. This has dented trust and I am absolutely committed to rebuilding that.

‘I don’t think we have all the answers yet – we will find a solution either as an industry or individually – we will leave no stone unturned.’

He said there would be a renewed focus on buying British meat – almost 75 per cent of its beef is locally sourced. Asda is also attempting to own more of its own processing factories.

A new survey shows that one in four shoppers have resolved to buy less processed meat since the scandal broke.

The equivalent of four million people had decided to stop buying processed meat altogether after horse DNA was found in beef products, a survey by Consumer Intelligence found.

Just over one in five have also started buying less meat overall while 6 per cent claimed to know someone who had gone vegetarian as a direct result of the scandal.

Mr Clarke admitted trust among consumers had been dented, but said his solution would be a ‘belt and braces’ approach to labelling to restore confidence.

He said: ‘We weren’t on our own to be shocked by what came out six weeks ago.

‘For us as a business, the first thing we did was look inside our own organisation to identify if we had anything we should be concerned about.

‘Right from the start we took a very transparent approach and, of course, embarked on what is a world-leading change for the industry and our organisation in terms of testing.

‘What is clear is that there is significant adulteration in the supply chain.

‘For Asda, at the end of the day, our customers come into our stores and they expect to buy what’s on the label.’

The firm, which is owned by America’s Wal-Mart posted a 0.1 per cent increase in underlying sales for the fourth quarter, contributing to a 1 per cent rise in annual sales.
