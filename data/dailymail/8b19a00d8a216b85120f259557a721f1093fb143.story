These celebrity 'mash-up' images prove there is often a spooky resemblance between the stars of today and yesteryear.

The pictures, made by Swedish artist George Chamoun for his Iconatomy collection, were created by taking a black and white image of a silver screen icon and blending it with the face of a current superstar.

The artist wanted to prove how modern ideas of beauty have barely changed over the last century - and it really is quite astounding just how similar some of the stars are.

The face of Scarlett Johansson, commonly referred to as a modern-day Hollywood siren, is mixed with the ultimate glamour-girl Marylin Monroe in the collection.

In the image Miss Johnansson's eyes and lips remain, but they are set upon the iconic hair of Monroe - made famous for her role in several iconic films of the 50s and 60s.

Elizabeth Taylor and Angelina Jolie are also mixed in the unique project - with the similarity between the two women's eyes being particularly striking.Â

Miss Jolie's infamous bee-stung lips feature and the statement cropped jet-black hair of Taylor remains.

Film and fashion icon Audrey Hepburn appears mixed with the gorgeous Natalie Portman.

Hepburn went down in history as one of the world's most stylish women following her role as Holly Golightly in 1961 film Breakfast At Tiffany's, while movie star Portman has featured in numerous fashion campaigns for high-end designers.

In the male images, two of the world's most desirable men ever - Cary Grant and George Clooney - are mixed.

Clooney shot to fame for his role as Dr Doug Ross in hospital drama ER. British-born Grant is considered Hollywood's definitive leading men following a series of popular films throughout the 1940s.

Cultural icon James Dean is mixed with Twilight star Robert Pattinson in the final picture of the series.

The collection took the artist three weeks to create.

Mr Chamoun, a jewelry design student at the Konstfack University of the Arts, created Iconatomy as a way of looking at celebrities, fashion icons and other personalities that have influenced the confines of beauty today.

The artist completed the collection, which can be found on his website, in 
order to pose a number of questions about beauty and whether it was 
subjective and timeless.

Mr Chamoun leafed through thousands of pictures to identify similarities between famous faces.

He then found two images taken from a similar angle - essential so that the images fit together - and merged them.
