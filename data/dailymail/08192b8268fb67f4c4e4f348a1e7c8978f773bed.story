A 'smirking' gunman who shot a student dead was tattooed only two days later with a teardrop design that signified he was a killer, a court heard yesterday.

Kiaran Stapleton, 21, who appeared in court amid heavy security charged with the murder of Anuj Bidve, was told by shop staff that the tattoo suggested the wearer had killed someone, a jury was told.

Brian Cummings QC, prosecuting, said: ‘This was pointed out in an effort to ensure this was really what he wanted and he said words to the effect that he killed his goldfish and did that count?’

Stapleton has already pleaded guilty 
to the manslaughter of Mr Bidve on Boxing Day last year on the grounds 
of diminished responsibility but that admission has been rejected by 
lawyers.

Mr Bidve’s parents, Subhash and 
Yogini, travelled from their home in Pune, India, to Manchester Crown 
Court   for the start of the trial.

The jury heard Indian-born Mr Bidve, 
23, had been in the UK since September 2011, when he enrolled on a 
postgraduate micro-electronics course at Lancaster University.

He decided to go to Manchester with friends for the Boxing Day sales instead of returning home for the holidays.

The group of five women and four men 
had set off from their hotel sometime after midnight and were using a 
GPS phone to guide them.

They were walking through Ordsall, Salford, towards Manchester city centre when they saw two men.

Mr Cummings said as they got closer 
one of the men crossed the road and approached them, asking the time. He
said: ‘One of the group answered that it was 1.30am.

‘With no warning, the male produced a gun, put it to the head of Anuj Bidve, and fired a shot.

‘He immediately fell to the ground, fatally injured.

‘The gunman smirked or laughed and ran off.’

Stapleton and his friend, Ryan Holden,
allegedly fled into the housing estate where they lived, and showered 
and discarded their clothes.

During the investigation, police 
seized CCTV footage from a nearby garage which showed Stapleton walking 
towards the scene of the shooting with Holden. Holden was arrested at 
his home in Ordsall 48 hours after the shooting and initially refused to
speak to police, saying he feared for the safety of his family.

But he decided to give a statement after receiving assurances that they would receive police protection.

He said Stapleton had been in a 
long-term relationship with his cousin, Chelsea Holden, and they had had
a child together but had split up in 2011.

The court heard Stapleton had been out
with Holden earlier on Christmas Day and was fine until he was told his
ex-girlfriend had slept with another man when he had been living with 
her.

The jury was told Stapleton was ‘p***** off’ and said something like: ‘If I see him, I’ll kill him.’

Mr Cummings alleged: ‘He then went on 
to say something to the effect that this had been the worst year for him
– he’d lost his girlfriend, lost his house, lost his licence and hardly
saw his kid.’

The pair became aware of Mr Bidve and his friends as they walked home, Mr Cummings said.

He added: ‘They could see they were not local. They were dark skinned and not dressed like Salford people.

‘They seemed to be having a laugh. As 
they drew almost level with this group, Stapleton said to Holden “Wait 
here a minute.” He then walked across the road.

‘(Holden) couldn’t hear anything that 
was said but he saw Stapleton raise his arm and make a gesture as though
he was asking the time.

‘Stapleton moved back a little and 
Holden again saw Stapleton raise an arm, he couldn’t remember if it was 
the same arm, stretch it out as if he was going to shoot and then Holden
heard a loud shot.’

Mr Cummings said: ‘He also heard a lot
of screaming and then Stapleton ran back towards him, shouting “Run!” 
but he was already running.

‘They ran back to Stapleton’s house where he told Holden to “Chill the **** out” and “Don’t fold on me”.’

Holden did not know Stapleton had a gun before he heard the shot, Mr Cummings added.

Stapleton was arrested in the early hours of December 29.

When he appeared before magistrates the next morning he gave his name as ‘Psycho Stapleton’.

Mr Cummings said: ‘The prosecution do not accept this is a case of manslaughter and we seek a conviction for murder.

‘If you deliberately fire a loaded gun
at someone’s head, you must intend to cause really serious injury or 
death. Kiaran Stapleton intended to kill.’

The trial continues.
