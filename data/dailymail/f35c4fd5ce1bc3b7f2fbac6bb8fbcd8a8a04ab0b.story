Meet Loca, the Northern Irish pug who might just be the most hilarious dog ever.

Adorable little Loca looks just like any ordinary pug until she starts doing one thing: trying to run.

And thanks to her Belfast family who have captured their cherished pet's funny movements in a series of musical home videos, Loca is now entertaining the world via her very own YouTube channel - which has already notched up over four million hits.

Loca - who suffers from a 
neurological condition called ataxia which is not painful or 
life-threatening - is now known as 'the pug that could not run' due to 
her first home video of the same name, which has gone viral with almost 3.5m YouTube hits.

The 
video shows Loca dancing around in fields with her dog siblings, all of 
whom can run perfectly normally. Loca, however, bounces and trips around
the grass, rolly-pollying into mud puddles and leaping into the air as 
if she's been given a series of small electric shocks.

Alongside the action a 'Loca' voiceover sings: 'Well hello, my name is Loca and I'm a special pug. 'I live in Belfast, Ireland, and my 
favourite thing's a hug. I love to eat roast chicken and my friends say 
I'm good fun, but the one thing that I cannot do is I can't fe***n' run.

'I'm bouncin', flouncin', fallin' all around the show, rollin', bowlin', I just can't get it right, skippin', hoppin', trippin' up and floppin', I just can't get the hang of it though trying as I might.'

To ensure no viewers worry about the 
health of Loca - whose name means 'crazy' in Spanish - owner Mal has 
issued a statement at the end of the video saying: 'Hi Folks,
just so everyone understands, Loca suffers from a mild brain disorder.

'It is operable but risky and as the vet says she is unaware anything is 
wrong with her and will live a long and healthy life, we decided not to
risk losing her.

'She
is loved by all, spoilt rotten and closely protected by the other dogs 
and lives her life to the full despite her difficulty running. All that 
said she is very funny to watch so we thought we should share with 
others and hope she brings as much joy to you as she does to us.'

There are three clinical types of ataxia: sensory (proprioceptive), vestibular, and cerebellar. All three types produce changes in limb coordination, but vestibular and cerebellar ataxia also produce changes in head and neck movement.

Sensory (proprioceptive) ataxia occurs when the spinal cord is slowly compressed. A typical outward symptom of sensory ataxia is misplacing the feet, accompanied by a progressive weakness as the disease advances. Sensory ataxia can occur with spinal cord, brain stem (the lower part of the brain near the neck), and cerebral locations of lesions.

The vestibulocochlear nerve carries information concerning balance from the inner ear to the brain. Damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve can cause changes in head and neck position, as the affected animal may feel a false sense of movement, or may be having problems with hearing. Outward symptoms include leaning, tipping, falling, or even rolling over. Central vestibular signs usually have changing types of eye movements, sensory deficits, weakness in the legs (all or one sided), multiple cranial nerve signs, and drowsiness, stupor, or coma. Peripheral vestibular signs do not include changes in mental status, vertical eye movements, sensory deficits, or weakness in the legs.

Cerebellar ataxia is reflected in uncoordinated motor activity of the limbs, head and neck, taking large steps, stepping oddly, head tremors, body tremors and swaying of the torso. There is an inadequacy in the performance of motor activity and in strength preservation.
