One of the last homeowners in England without electricity faces a £20,000 bill to be connected to the National Grid - despite living just a few yards from power lines.

Retired Graham Spittey, 65, generates his energy with a noisy diesel generator and has to buy fresh food every day because he can’t have a fridge or freezer, even though his nearest neighbour, who lives 30 yards away, enjoys 24-hour electricity.

Mr Spittey has spent years spent begging the National Grid to hook up his remote farmhouse in the Cornish village of Temple to mains electricity, and thought he had finally won last October when Western Power Distribution (WPD) agreed to extend existing electricity cables to his 200-year-old home for £6,800.

But just as the former telephone engineer was planning which electrical gadgets he might treat himself to, the company refunded his money and told him connection to the mains would now cost him £20,000.

Mr Spittey was told the price had gone up because workers would need to close off part of the nearby A30, one of the region’s busiest roads, to fit underground cables.

He said: 'I would love to live in the 21st century but sometimes it seems as if even the 20th century hasn’t happened yet.

'Apparently the company now wants to renegotiate the price. They’ve told me it could now cost up to £20,000 to connect me, but that they don’t know for sure.

'They keep saying they’ll come back to me with a firm price but it’s just delay, delay and more delay.'

Graham relies on an ageing Lister diesel generator to power his home for four or five hours a day, and can’t use any electrical items that need constant power.

Despite its secluded location, his £350,000 property is just a few hundred yards from the A30 trunk road, and has BT poles right outside it.

Mr Spittey said: 'Years ago when I first
 thought about having mains electricity there were planning objections, 
to do with it being an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and so on.

'I just want to live in the 21st century': But Mr Spittey still has to use this ancient generator for power

'But there are now BT poles right outside my house, the main A30 has been upgraded a number of times and it’s about to be turned into a dual carriageway.

'There are electricity pylons and poles all across Bodmin moor - so I can't see that there are any planning issues at all.'

He added: 'The most sensible thing is probably to just extend the mains cable that powers my neighbours but apparently the existing cable isn’t powerful enough to cope with two properties.

'I’ve suggested uprating that cable, but still nothing has happened. I’m just waiting for Western Power to tell me what’s going on, and I’ve been waiting now for nearly a year.'

WPD said scheduled works to widen the A30 may give their engineers a chance to run cables underneath while the road is being dug up.

Almost 
every home in England and Wales is connected to the National Grid, with 
nine properties in the tiny North Wales village of Abergeirw among the 
last to be hooked up in 2008.

Most of rural Cornwall was connected in the early 20th century, with even the smallest villages joining in the 1950s and 60s.

Remote: Mr Spittey bought his farmhouse in the middle of Bodmin Moor in Cornwall 20 years ago

By the end of the 20th century only a handful of isolated rural settlements remained without a mains electricity supply.

Mr Spittey, who dreams of having a fridge-freezer and a proper shower, says he was told 15 years ago there were only nine people in the country without mains electricity - and he thinks he now might be the last.

 

'When I bough the house 20 years ago I thought we would get mains electricity very soon.  Now I still dream of a fridge, a freezer, and a proper shower.'

  - householder Graham Spittey, 65

He and his late wife, Glenise, bought the three-bedroom farmhouse 20 years ago and assumed it would be a simple job to have it hooked up to the National Grid.

But he still relies on a noisy old diesel generator and has to make a 20-mile round trip every day to get fresh fruit and veg because he can't preserve anything for more than a few hours.

The father-of-five, whose wife died two years ago, said: 'When I bought the house I thought we would get mains electricity very soon, but it's been 20 years and I really need it now.

'The main things I would like are a fridge and freezer and a proper power shower. I'm fed up with my existing one, the water just drips out weakly.

'The generator breaks a couple of times a year so I have to get someone to come out, and it means I'm left without electricity for a couple of days and I have to rely on friends and family.

'I always have lots of candles, torches and batteries on standby just in case the power goes.

'It costs around £1,000 a year to power and I use five litres of diesel a day in the summer and ten in the winter.'

The grandfather of six, who says he has to go to his brother's house to watch football, added: 'You can guarantee that if there's an important match on the TV will go dead right at the vital moment.'

Said the cost had gone up because they'd have to close the A30 to do it
