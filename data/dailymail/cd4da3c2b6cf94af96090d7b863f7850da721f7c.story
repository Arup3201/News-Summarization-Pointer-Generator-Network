Politicians were joined by familiar faces of notable individuals at tonight’s State of the Union as elected officials picked key guests to bring to the speech.

Relatives and victims of gun violence were the biggest group of guests, as family members of the children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School and the Aurora movie theater shooting were invited by 20 Congressman.

Individuals from other segments of the population were invited to personify various points in President Obama’s address, serving as makeshift tea-leaves to tell what he feels were the key issues to drive home.

NASA’s Bobak ‘mohawk guy’ Ferdowsi was invited by the First Lady, and singer Tony Bennett was a guest of Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s after he starred in an ad promoting gun controls.

First Lady: Michelle Obama last night invited key supporters of her husband's policy to join her for President Obama's State of the Union speech. Honoured guests included Nathaniel and Cleopatra Pendelton, left, and Dr. Jill Biden, right, with Apple CEO Tim Smith, third left, top row

Honored guests: The first three rows near the First Lady were chocked-full of individuals who represent various parts of the President's policy initiatives

1. Sergeant Sheena Adams is a decorated veteran who earned the Combat Action Ribbon and Navy and Marine Corp Achievement Medal. Given the recent decision to lift the ban against women serving in combat roles, her long service in the military gave a pointed message. 2. and 3. The parents of Hadiya Pendleton are the guests of Michelle Obama. The First Lady got to know Nathaniel and Cleopatra Pendleton when she traveled to Chicago to attend the 15-year-old girl's funeral. 

First Lady Michelle Obama enthusiastically greeted those sitting around her before being serious throughout the speech, which went on for more than an hour.

Emotional: Sandy Hook teacher Kaitlin Roig was seated next to Dr Jill Biden and rose to her feet during a portion where the President spoke about gun control

4. Menchu de Luna Lopez is
a nurse at New York University Hospital who helped save 20 babies when 
the power went out in the hospital following a power outage from 
Hurricane Sandy. The superstorm came up early in the speech, as the 
President directly attributed the devastating storm to global warming.

5. Dr Jill Biden sat two seats over from the First Lady, and her husband Vice President Hoe Biden was seated behind the President at the front of the room. 6. A key spot was given to Sandy Hook teacher Kaitlin Roig who saved the lives of her students by hiding them in a closet for the remainder of the massacre. The 29-year-old teacher spoke publicly after the incident about how she tried to keep them quiet and was reticent to open the door to emergency responders for fear that it was a trick by the shooter.7. Alan Aleman's inclusion appears to be a pure policy move as he was one of the first people in Nevada who were able to legally remain in the country following the passage of the President's immigration reform for the children of illegal immigrants. Adding to his attractiveness for the cause is the fact that he is a college student seeking a degree in biology and hopes to be a doctor.

Second row: Economic themes and personal perseverance were present in the stories of these guests

8. Small business owner Deb Carey represents an economic success story as she and her husband created the New Glarus Brewing Company in Wisconsin. They sold their home and rallied outside support to raise seed money and they now employ 50 full-time employees. 9. Apple CEO Tim Cook was invited by the First Lady and though he was never pointed out by name, his role in the national economy makes him a major player. The biggest allusion to his presence was Mr Obama's reference to the threat posed by cyber attacks. 10. President Obama frequently references his two daughters when talking about equal-pay policies. Tonight, however, he used Amanda McMillan, a woman who has filed a fair-pay suit against her former employers in Mississippi after she was not promoted for a higher paying job.  

Third row: Some of the causes that the First Lady has worked on throughout the first term- like support for military families and healthy eating initiatives- were highlighted by these guests

15. Tracey Hepner is a co-founder of Military Partners and Families Coalition and her presence comes just days after the Pentagon announced extended benefits for the spouses of military members. Ms Hepner is married to Army Birgadier General Tammy Smith.

Injured: U.S. Marine Sergeant Carlos Evans is a double amputee after losing both of his legs and a hand during his four deployments

16, One of the youngest attendees was 12-year-old Haile Thomas,
who was invited because she helped start an organization that promotes 
healthy cooking tutorials. Mrs Obama has largely based her agenda on 
health initiatives like Let's Move, so the fact that she would include 
someone related to the cause.

17. Energy independence is an item that the President has listed towards the top of his agenda, and Lee Maxwell represented the cause as he works as a wind energy technician. When he was called by the white House about the event, he was told that they were looking for middle class citizens influenced by the President's policies. 18. Another one of the First Lady's causes has been the support of military veterans, and Sergeant Carlos Evans (right) was invited accordingly. The U.S. Marine is a double amputee after losing both of his legs and a hand during his four deployments. 19. Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett is the rare political aide who made the cut and was able to sit within the prized three rows during the speech. 20. Though he looked bored at many points during the speech, Jack Andraka's mind is at work outside of the Capitol. The 16-year-old won $75,000 after inventing a test that detects the early stages of pancreatic cancer.

Faces in the crowd: Michelle Obama and Dr Jill Biden were surrounded by the noted guests

Other special guests who were scattered throughout the audience:

In a similar vein, the NASA engineer who
became famous for his distinguishable mohawk during the Mars landing 
will also be seated near the First Lady. Bobak Ferdowsi (below left) become
something of an internet sensation following the August landing and his
notoriety will lend credence to any space program mentions that Mr 
Obama chooses to include.

One of the oldest attendees is Desiline Victor
(below right), an 102-year-old woman who has a cause celebre since waiting in
line for three hours to vote. She has become somewhat of a symbol for 
the movement and her attendance is clear that the issue will be 
addressed.

Happy to be there: NASA flight director Bobak Ferdowsi (left)was in the first row and 102-year-old Desiline Victor, who was made to wait for two hours to vote, was in the fourth (right)

Guests related to the push for gun control measures:

Carlos Soto Jr., the younger brother of slain Sandy Hook Elementary School teacher Vicky Soto, is the guest of Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro who represents a district in Connecticut near the site of the December massacre.

Newtown chief administrator Pat Llodra was the public face of the aftermath from the shooting, and she is the guest of Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal.

Two local police detectives- Jason Frank and Dan McAnaspie- were invited by the state’s other Senator Chris Murphy. They were among the first responders at the tragic scene following the December 14 shooting.

Teresa Hoover, a mother whose son A.J. Boik died in the Aurora movie theater shooting, is the guest of Colorado Congressman Ed Perlmutter.

Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and 
her husband astronaut Mark Kelly are the guests of Democratic 
Congressman Ron Barber and Republican Senator John McCain.

Familiar faces: Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and her husband astronaut Mark Kelly wore green ribbons in honor of the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting

Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi brought in an unidentified fourth grader who attends a different Newtown school. The child wrote a letter pushing for stricter gun control following the shooting.

Though members of Congress and the 
Senate are automatically invited, governors are not typically on the 
guest list. Mrs Pelosi made a point to invite Maryland's Democratic 
Governor Martin O'Malley since he has enacted strict laws against guns in his state.

Singer Tony Bennett (below) attended the speech as a guest of Mrs Pelosi. Though his name is clearly more recognizable than a number of the others connected to the push for stricter gun control, the Grammy winner was featured in an ad supporting the cause.

Singing his tune: Tony Bennett was a guest of Nancy Pelosi because he starred in an ad advocating for stronger gun control laws

Republican politicians bring some famous faces to the crowd:

Singer Ted Nugent (below) was a controversial invite since he has long-been critical of the Obama administration, regularly threatening the President in public statements. He is the guest of Congressman Steve Stockman from Texas, and as he is a prominent gun enthusiast, he will be a clear contrast to the many guest who are relatives to victims of gun violence who are pushing for controls. Notably, he chose to wear jeans to the ceremony.

Unexpected: Singer Ted Nugent, who has been a long-time critic of President Obama was invited to the speech from a pro-gun Congressman from Texas

House Speaker John Boehner picked more crowd-pleasing guests, including Gail McGovern, the president of the American Red Cross, and Arthur Mola, the principal of the bilingual Sacred Heart School in Washington, D.C. Mr Mola will be sitting alongside two fourth graders- Laci Joseph and Henry Joseph III- who attend nearby St. Anthony’s Catholic School. Mr Boehner’s connection to the children is unclear.

Paying tribute to his home state, Mr Boehner invited Ted Kremer, a former batboy for the Cincinnati Reds baseball team who has Downs syndrome.

In an unexpected move, he also invited Jason Barlow who heads a local branch of the United Auto Workers union. Republicans have blasted unions and many gained points among voters by standing against the groups, as was seen in Wisconsin.
