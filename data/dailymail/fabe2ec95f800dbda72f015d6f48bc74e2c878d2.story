Many women might be put off by an ex-soldier who spent nearly three years years living with wolves in a muddy wildlife park without taking a shower - but Shaun Ellis has finally found his match.

The 47-year-old ‘Wolfman’, who is believed to have the strongest bond with the wild animals of any human, taught his girlfriend Isla, 30, how to live as one of them - and now they have tied the knot.

The couple met in September 2009, and more than two years after their first date in April 2010, they wed in a Native American ceremony in Devon, wearing traditional dress and writing their own vows.

In love: 'Wolfman' Shaun and his new wife Isla Ellis tie the knot at their Native American marriage ceremony

Friends: The 47-year-old 'Wolfman', who is believed to have the strongest bond with the wild animals of any human, taught his girlfriend Isla, 30, how to live as one of them

Housing: Such is their love of all things Native American, a teepee on the fringes of an area of land where the wolves are housed has become a part-time home during their spells studying them up close

Such is their love of all things 
Native American, a teepee on the fringes of an area of land where the 
wolves are housed has become a part-time home during their spells 
studying them up close.

Mrs 
Ellis said: ‘It was love at first sight when I met Shaun. I didn’t 
really know what love was until I was introduced to him. I always had an
 image in my head of my ideal man, and I guess Shaun is him.

‘Shaun
 has taught me a lot about the wolves, especially to respect them. 
Thankfully I’ve never been attacked or injured by them as it doesn’t 
make sense for them to harm a fellow pack member.'

Her
 husband spent two-and-a-half years hunting, eating, howling and 
sleeping with four male wolves in a park - even 
restricting his diet to meat and not showering so his body odour would match theirs.

Mr
 Ellis, who has four children from a previous relationship, said: ‘I 
feel completely at home with the wolves. I’ve always felt more 
comfortable in their presence than I have ever felt in the human world.

Howling: Mr Ellis taught Isla the ways of the wolf world, and she now has her own pack - two males and a female - at their canine education, conservation and wolf research centre in Coombe Martin, Devon

‘When I’m away from them I miss them terribly, I almost need and long for them. To me they are exactly the same as a human family because we are so closely connected.

'It was love at first sight when I met Shaun. I didn’t really know what love was until I was introduced to him'

Isla Ellis

‘So when I met Isla I wanted to share them with her. It only seemed natural. We are one big family.’

He taught Isla about the wolf world, and she now has her own pack - two males and a female - at their canine education, conservation and wolf research centre in Coombe Martin, Devon.

The couple now split their time between quaint village life and their family - seven North American Timber wolves. Mrs Ellis said she is fulfilling ‘everything I ever wanted to do’ with her life.

She added: ‘It’s a lifestyle that I absolutely love and enjoy. We want to educate people about how we can co-exist with wildlife - and what better way to do that than learn directly from the pack?

‘I can’t imagine doing anything other than running with the wolf pack and studying their behaviour - they teach us far more than we ever would think.

‘My friends and family love the fact I am happy here with them. They can see it is an absolute ideal environment for me.

‘Ever since I was a little girl I would ask my parents for a small wolf every Christmas and birthday. Now my wish has come true, but instead of just one I’ve got a whole pack.’

Their extraordinary integration into the packs is aimed at helping shed light on the behaviour of wolves, giving scientists around the world spectacular insight.

Mr Ellis added: ‘My integration began when the wolves were just a few days of age. They were abandoned by their parents and I had to raise them on a bottle, but they are just over eight now.

‘I spent two-and-a-half years constantly with them 24/7. Even now I spend most of my day with them. A lot of becoming a member of the pack is based on sound, that haunting howl they're renowned for.

'I can’t imagine doing anything other than running with the wolf pack and studying their behaviour - they teach us far more than we ever would think'

Isla Ellis

‘Once I could communicate with them I was accepted through sound. Then it was a case of maintaining my place in the pack. Every day you have to prove your worth to them.’

But despite an apparent ease at being accepted, Mr Ellis was often bitten by his wolf family.

He added: ‘They would most probably be too afraid of a human to actually do us any harm but the potential is definitely there. Even boisterous play from them can end up in several stitches.

‘They can really pull their punches. Some of the most serious injuries they have inflicted on me have been the internal ones from head butts and being rammed.

Scary teeth: Mr Ellis said some of the most serious injuries they have inflicted on him have been the 'internal ones from head butts and being rammed'

‘I’ve been hit in the head and knocked unconscious before. They’ve rammed me in the stomach and caused problems internally. Then there are the countless superficial cuts and bruises.’

'Although they don’t intend to harm me, one mistake could prove fatal. That’s when it is most scary'

Shaun Ellis

‘During feeding you really get a sense of their power. When you’re eating from a carcass you have snarling, snapping teeth either side of you.

'Although they don’t intend to harm me, one mistake could prove fatal. That’s when it is most scary.’

Mr Ellis said he has been called a ‘madman’, ‘crazy’ and ‘a lunatic’ by people when telling them about his profession.

But he added: ‘On occasions I probably have questioned it myself. But it only takes one person to value your work to realise I can make a difference.’
