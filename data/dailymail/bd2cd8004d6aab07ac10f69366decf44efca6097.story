A Maryland woman and two teens are facing multiple charges for attacking the woman's ex-boyfriend with a tire iron after he complained about the trio having a threesome in his home, police say. 

Glenda Rodriguez, 32, and Luis Figueroa, 18, of Silver Spring are facing a slew of felony charges including attempted first-degree murder and first-degree assault for the early December attack on 32-year-old Andres Hernandez.

An unnamed 16-year-old, Figueroa's girlfriend, has also been charged.

Days prior to the brutal attack, the victim caught Rodriguez having sex with the two teens in his home, according to ABC 7. 

Enraged, Hernandez began bad-mouthing Rodriguez and the two teens, who had been living in the home as well. The three lovers were so offended by Hernandez's words that they devised a plan.

Rodriguez lured Hernandez to a location offering him sex, ABC reports, while the two teens hid in a nearby porta-potty with a tire iron.

Cousin: Hernandez' cousin, Miguel Ortiz (photographed), said the teens repeatedly hit his cousin in the head because they 'wanted to kill him'

When the two had finished, Figueroa and the 16-year-old exited the porta-potty and attacked Hernandez leaving him unconscious, with four deep lacerations to the head.

'They only hit him in the head, nowhere on the body, because they wanted to kill him,' Miguel Ortiz, the victim's cousin, told ABC. 

The trio then got into Rodriguez's car and sped away.

Paramedics took Hernandez to Suburban Hospital in Bethesda where he required a lot of staples and stitches. He is expected to make a full recovery, ABC reports.

If found guilty, Rodriguez and Figueroa could face a sentence of life in prison, FOX 45 reports. The 6-year-old's records are sealed because she is a minor.

'All we want is justice, because there was no reason for them to do what they did to him,' Ortiz said . 'There was no reason to do it.'

Rodriguez and Figueroa will return to Montgomery County District Court for their next hearing in January.
