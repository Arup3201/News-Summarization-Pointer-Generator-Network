A Chinese monastery has destroyed a series of priceless ancient wall frescos, by painting over them what look like scenes from a Disney cartoon.

The original Buddhist artworks at the Yunjie Temple in China's Liaoning Province were believed to have been created some 270 years ago during the early Qing Dynasty.

They had faded badly over the years and 
the abbot had approached a company to carry out a proper restoration but
was told it would cost 4 million yuan (£404,000).

Local tourist authorities hired contractors to carry out the work who simply painted over the originals with garish, cartoon-like figures depicting scenes from Taoist myths.

When authorities from the city government of Chaoyang discovered the work they were horrified. Two officials deemed responsible have now been fired. 

Li Haifeng, the Chaoyang government deputy secretary-general, told the Global times: 'Considering the temple's buildings are mainly made of straw and soil, and they need to be maintained, the abbot of the temple applied to the scenic area management office, and then the office made an application to the city's cultural heritage authority.'

Aftermath: Two tourist-office employees were fired after hiring 'sub-standard' contractors to carry out the restoration work

'The abbot found a company to start the restoration work,' Li said. 'The work needed about 4 million yuan ($660,000), but the temple management office did not have that much money. So the abbot helped raise funds to restore the temple.'

Internet users took the the weibo microblogging site to complain, branding the new paintings 'even worse than cartoons'.

One user wrote: 'As a man from Chaoyang, I sincerely feel some people's brains were kicked by a donkey,'

'I should have cut the frescos down with a knife and brought them home if I had predicted this.'

Another poster said: 'Ignorance is horrible!'

A pagoda in the temple complex is understood to date back to the Liao period (916-1125) however authorities said the paintings were in a Qing dynasty hall.

Goof: Some have compared the new paintings to a Disney cartoon
