A French mayor has been ridiculed after building an 'anti-burglary wall' that stands just one metre-high.

Steeve Briois is mayor of Hénin-Beaumont in the north of the country and decided to take drastic action following a spate of violent robberies.

To keep unwanted visitors away from a residential area, he lobbied for a thick stone wall to be built directly across a street to prevent further attacks.

But locals are not laughing at the pitiful protection the wall offers as it has forced some to take a four-mile detour to get around the tiny town. 

Pitiful: The one-metre high wall in the town of Hénin-Beaumont has been mocked after it was built following a spate of violent robberies in the area

Ridicule: Mayor Steeve Briois has defended the building of the wall, and said 90 per cent of residents voted in favour of it

But Mr Briois, a member of the far-right National Front party, has defended the decision to build the wall after coming under fire from the French press. 

On his blog, he wrote that 'around 90 percent' of the 200 people in the area had voted in favour of the construction.

He added: 'The decision was made after two burglars stabbed a man in his home - including once in the head. Two hundred residents then met up to to find an urgent solution to this intolerable situation.

'The safety of my fellow citizens is a priority...and I won't give up.' 

But locals have so far been unimpressed with the barricade, and many left frustrated as it causes them to take lengthy detours.

One woman, who voted against the wall, told French newspaper Le Figaro that she didn't think building a wall in the street was 'a real solution' 

She added: 'Today, my husband had to take an eight-kilometre detour just to get to work.'

Local media are also now reporting that a new petition to take down the wall is now doing the rounds in the area.
