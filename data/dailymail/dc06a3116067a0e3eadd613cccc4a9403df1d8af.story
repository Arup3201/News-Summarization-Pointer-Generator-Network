This is the moment a former Superbike racer is arrested at Heathrow on suspicion of his wife's murder after she fell to her death on their honeymoon in Dubai.

Sean Emmett, 43, finally had his passport given back to him by officials in the United Arab Emirates months after a probe into wife Abbie’s death had concluded.

He was held by officers from Surrey Police when he arrived at the UK's biggest airport this morning.

As he was ushered into a police van, he said it was 'lovely' and a 'huge relief' to be back in Britain.

Emmett, who has three children from a 
previous marriage, added: 'I just want to see my family. I am looking 
forward to seeing my mum and my kids'.

'Huge relief' to be back: Former Superbike racer Sean Emmett arrives back at Heathrow where is arrested on suspicion of his wife's murder ten months after she fell to her death on their honeymoon in Dubai

Emmett said he was looking forward to seeing his mother and children as he was ushered into a police van

Emmett was held by officers from Surrey Police who met him on his arrival at the UK's biggest airport

He
refused to comment on his time in Dubai, where he has been stranded 
since his passport was handed to officials during the investigation.

Mrs Emmett, 27, died in February after falling several floors from a high-rise hotel in Dubai.

A
Surrey Police spokesman said: 'A 43-year-old man has today been 
arrested by Surrey Police officers at Heathrow Airport in connection 
with the death of Surrey resident Abigail Emmett, nee Elson, in Dubai in
February 2013.

'The man remains in custody while inquiries continue and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.'

Scene: The couple had been staying at the luxury Jumeirah Creekside Hotel in Dubai when Mrs Emmett fell to her death just days into their honeymoon

Before his arrest, he had posted a picture of his newly returned passport on Twitter, describing it as the 'best early Xmas pressie ever'.

He wrote on the social networking site today: 'Thanks to everyone for all your messages, my phone's melting!!

'Flight booked and I'll be landing in Blighty 7.10 tmrw. #bringonthecold.'

Emmett, a 19-times British Superbike race winner, was questioned by officers after Mrs Emmett fell 50ft from a hotel balcony.

Mr Emmet can be arrested by British Police in connection with the death because of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.

It states: 'Where any murder or manslaughter shall be committed on land out of the United Kingdom, whether within the Queen’s dominions or without, and whether the person killed were a subject of Her Majesty or not, every offence committed by any subject of Her Majesty in respect of any such case, whether the same shall amount to the offence of murder or of manslaughter.'

Mrs
Emmett, a vicar's daughter, had only been at the luxury Jumeirah 
Creekside Hotel for two nights when she toppled from the balcony in 
February.

Mr Emmett said that, following a night out, Abbie had been drinking in their hotel room when she dropped her new wedding ring.

He
claimed she had been emotional because she had been drinking and was 
upset that the pair were due to return home to Addlestone, Surrey.

Mr
Emmett said that after his bride's tragic fall he had ran downstairs 
and found her limp and lifeless body on the ground beneath the balcony.

He said he performed CPR until paramedics reached the scene.

He was then questioned by police and said that officers only told him that Mrs Emmett had died the following day.

At
the time, Mr Emmett, who has three children from a previous marriage - 
Tiffany, 19, Brittany, 15, and 14-year-old Freddie - said police told 
him there were no suspicious circumstances and he could not understand 
why he was not allowed to leave Dubai.

Last
month, Mr Emmett sent a message of thanks to supporters on Twitter, 
writing: 'Just want to thank each and every one of you that has helped 
me with support, financial or otherwise.

'I don’t even have contacts for some!'
