An unexplained S-shaped object has been spotted high in the sky above the Western Australia coast.

The bizarre shape was spotted on the weather radar maps on Wednesday about 30 kilometres west of Rottnest.

Forecasters ruled out a strange cloud formation - and locals have already dubbed it the 'Rottnest monster'.

The bizarre shape was spotted off the coast of Western Australia, close to Rottnest Island, leading to it being dubbed the Rottnest monster

'There's no cloud, there's nothing to produce a rain echo, ... which we do see a lot, but not this particular shape," the local weather bureau's Neil Bennett told ABC News.

'They don't take on S shapes and things like that.

'The radar that we use are there for the detection of precipitation, it's basically just a beam going out and hitting the rain droplets or ice particles from hail.

The WA Weather Group has seized on the photo and retweeted it to their followers.

'Nice that our pet #RottNessMonster has avoided the shark baits. Her name is Susan & she likes to eat plankton,' the group tweeted.

'And I, for one, welcome our new giant sea serpent overlords,' Perth Sunrise Prints tweeted.

The strange shape has been dubbed the Rottnest monster for its similarity to the famous image of the Loch Ness Monster

However, the monster was shortlived - a spokesman for the Department of Defence said in a statement today the image was actually a regular training activity involving ships and aircraft designed to prepare a Navy warship for an operational deployment.

'The environmental conditions over the West Australian coast at the time of the activity provided a unique opportunity for this routine activity to be visible on the weather radar display,' he said.

'This exercise is ongoing.'
