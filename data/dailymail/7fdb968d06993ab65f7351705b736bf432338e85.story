More than 200 prison officers have billed the taxpayer to hire dinner suits to allow them to attend awards ceremonies in style.

New figures reveal thousands of pounds of public money are spent each year by jail staff to rent evening dress, including ballgowns and bow ties.

Ministers have ordered a review of all civil service perks, but argued that without paying the clothing bill prison staff would not be able to attend glitzy bashes.

In the last five years the prison service has paid almost £14,800 in evening dress allowance, the Ministry of Justice revealed.

Having fallen when the coalition was first formed, last year the bill increased by almost a third to £2,734.25.

Justice minister Helen Grant said: ‘No Ministers or senior MoJ officials have made these claims.

‘These claims relate to a number of claims by prison officers for evening attire for a specific awards event, where the hire cost might otherwise affect their attendance.’

She added that in some cases prison officers could have submitted multiple claims.

‘Civil service terms and conditions are currently being reviewed through the civil service reform programme,’ Miss Grant added.

In May, MailOnline revealed how Government departments continued to spend thousands of pounds on perks for staff in the face of the age of austerity.

Since then the Department for Work and Pensions, which is overseeing deep cuts to the benefits bill, has admitted spending thousands of pounds on evening wear.

Since 2008-09 DWP staff have claimed £6,473 under the perk, including £1,700 since the coalition was formed.

In the last five years the Health and Safety Executive has paid out £2,600 in the evening dress allowance.

Under official Whitehall rules staff can claim for the cost of hiring evening dress to attend official work functions.

And if there are three events in the diary they can ask the taxpayer to help to buy them a suit or a dress.

The figures were uncovered by Tory MP Priti Patel, who has called for an end to the perks to cut the costs of Whitehall.

'British taxpayers will be astounded to see that they have been footing the bill for new suits and gowns for civil servants attending fancy events,' she said in May.

At the Ministry of Defence alone, expense claims for evening dress have reached almost £16,000 since 2008.

Vince Cable's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills paid out almost £3,000 from December 2011 and to May 2013.

At least five other departments offer the evening dress allowance but could not say how much it cost the taxpayer.

A Government spokesman said: 'We are reviewing Civil Service terms and conditions as part of our Civil Service Reform programme.

'The Civil Service will remain a good employer so it can attract and retain high quality staff.

'However some of its conditions have become outliers in comparison to the wider public and private sector and these will be addressed.'
