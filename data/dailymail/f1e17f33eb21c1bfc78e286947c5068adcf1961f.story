Demands: Albert Buitenhuis and his wife Marthie. The couple are being forced from their home as he is too over weight

This is the man who was told he is too fat to live in New Zealand, despite losing 66lb since moving there six years ago.

Albert Buitenhuis, who weighs 20 stone six pounds, was told that it may place demands on the New Zealand health services.

He and wife Marthie are now facing deportation from their Christchurch home and are living with his sister in Auckland as they fight the decision.

New Zealand is the third most obese nation in the developed world, coming behind the US and Mexico.

Albert is five feet ten inches tall and has a body mass index of 40, making him clinically obese.

But, he weighed 25 stone two pounds when he arrived in New Zealand after gaining weight when he quit smoking.

His wife Marthie said that his weight had not stopped Albert from working 40 hours a week as a chef.

She added that their annual visas have been approved every year since 2007 with little problem.

Marthie told The Press: ‘We applied for [them] year after year and there were no issues. They never mentioned Albert's weight or his health once and he was a lot heavier then.

‘We've committed no crime and did nothing wrong other than my husband being a foodie.’

But at the start of May the couple were told they must leave as Albert’s health was no longer acceptable.

Immigration New Zealand said that an applicant’s BMI must be under 35.

A spokesman said: ‘INZ's medical assessors have to consider to what extent there might be indications of future high-cost and high-need demand for health services.’

They claim that his weight increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease, cancer and fatty liver.

He also has a knee injury which could cost up to $20,000 to replace.

The Press reported that the couple’s doctor said he could bring his cholesterol and blood levels into the acceptable level within 26 weeks.

They have made an appeal to New Zealand Associate Minister of Immigration Nikki Kaye.
