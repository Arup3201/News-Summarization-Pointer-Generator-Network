The family of the woman who is accusing Florida State University's star quarterback of rape has hit out against assertions that the sex was consensual.

When it was revealed Wednesday that Jameis Winston's DNA was found in the woman's underwear, his attorney told reporters that Winston had consensual sex with her.

'To be clear, the victim did not consent. This was a rape,' the family said in a terse statement Friday.

Winston, who is a top Heisman Trophy contender and one of the biggest stars in college football, continues to lead the No. 2-ranked Seminoles and is expected to play against this afternoon against the University of Idaho.

Allegations: Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston smiled on the sidelines of a recent game but is now fighting serious claims

Prosecutors said they have 'four or five' things left to do before they can make a decision on whether to charge Winston.

The woman's family has been furious about how police in Tallahassee, Florida, handled the rape case, which was reported in December 2012.

The
family says they pushed to have a DNA sample taken from Winston only to
be told by a police detective that it would alert Winston and make the 
case public. The statement released Friday called it 'significant' that the DNA matches Winston.

Winston was a top prospect and a backup quarterback at the time.

When the FSU player was identified as
her attacker, her ‘family grew concerned that she would be targeted on 
campus,’ the statement continued, adding that a lawyer was retained.

A
detective ‘told the attorney that Tallahassee was a big football town’ 
and that the victim should give her allegations some thought because 
‘her life will be made miserable.’

The case was listed as 'open, status inactive.'

Under investigation: The team have stopped the quarterback from answering questions about the assault at their press conferences

It was only after the Tampa Bay Times
broke the story about the allegations against Winston that police 
referred the case to prosecutors.

The
quarterback has been accused of sexually assaulting the woman at an 
off-campus apartment in the early morning hours of Dec 7, 2012.

The
woman immediately contacted police and was cooperative with their 
investigation, said the family statement first published by the Tampa Bay Times.

‘Everybody wants to know what's going on,’ William Meggs, state attorney for the 2nd Judicial Circuit told ESPN.

‘So do we. We're in the process of trying to figure out what's going on,’ he added.

ESPN said they had seen the DNA analysis report undertaken by the Florida state crime lab.

The alleged victim carried out a sex assault test at the time of the alleged incident.

The
presence of DNA is not an indication of sex assault but does suggest 
the football player had sexual relations with his accuser.

Meggs told ESPN that investigators plan to use a combination of physical evidence and testimony to determine their course of action.

Officials blamed the delay on the accuser abandoning her cooperation with police in February.

‘In February 2013, the case was classified as open, but inactive, when the victim in the case broke off contact with TPD, and her attorney indicated she did not want to move forward at that time,’ a spokesperson told ESPN.

Accused: Mr Winston can outrun anyone on a football field, but he hasn't yet been able to distance himself from allegations almost a year old

Winston made his customary media appearance Wednesday before Saturday’s game, but the school prohibited him from answering any questions related to the investigation, according to ESPN.

He will be the starting quarterback for this weekend’s game against the University of Idaho.
