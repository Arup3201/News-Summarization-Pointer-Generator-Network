Detectives were last night investigating claims of an extraordinary police plot to ‘blacken the name’ of Andrew Mitchell – as a fabricated email sent by a serving officer was made public.

The barely literate message helped cost the then Chief Whip his job, despite the fact key sections of it were directly contradicted by CCTV footage viewed by the Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood days later.

Crucially, it was sent to Mr Mitchell’s deputy John Randall on the evening of September 20 – the night before details of his ‘Plebgate’ confrontation with police officers in Downing Street were made public by The Sun newspaper.

Controversy: Andrew Mitchell with his wife yesterday

The altercation happened on the 
evening of September 19 when Mr Mitchell tried to leave Downing Street 
on his bicycle by the main gate, but was told by police that he must use
the side gate.

He admits swearing at the officers but denies the most damaging allegation, that he called them ‘f***ing plebs’.

Mr Mitchell clung on to his job for three weeks before resigning when he lost the confidence of fellow Tory MPs.

The timing of the email, four days 
before an alleged copy of the official police log was leaked to the 
Daily Telegraph, shows that the sender had access to internal police 
information.

In it, the sender attempts to 
corroborate the account of officers on the gate, saying that Mr Mitchell
called them plebs and ‘continued to shout obscenities at the poor 
police officer’.

The email is now known to have been 
sent by a serving police officer posing as a member of the public and 
claiming to have witnessed the incident as a passer-by.

A second email claiming to be from an
alleged witness to the incident was sent to Mr Randall a few days later
but its contents have not been disclosed.

A constable in the elite Diplomatic Protection Group has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
Bernard Hogan-Howe has said the officer was not at the scene as he 
claimed, but has insisted this does not undermine the account given by 
the officers on duty.

Mr Hogan-Howe has repeatedly backed 
the account by his officers who confronted Mr Mitchell in Downing Street
and last night the Met said his position has not changed.

Yesterday Scotland Yard announced a 
major investigation into the controversy manned by 30 detectives. The 
inquiry is being supervised by the Independent Police Complaints 
Commission.

The inquiry will examine whether the 
officer who sent the email was acting alone or whether there was ‘any 
evidence of a conspiracy’.

Detectives are also investigating the source of the stories in the Sun and Daily Telegraph.

During Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron today expressed his dismay at the allegation that a police officer tried to 'blacken the name' of a Cabinet minister'

David Cameron told MPs yesterday : ‘A
police officer posing as a member of the public and sending an email 
potentially to blacken the name of a Cabinet minister is a very serious 
issue and does need to be seriously investigated.’

The first email was released by Channel 4 News last night.

The programme’s political 
correspondent, Michael Crick, said the officer had admitted not being at
the scene, adding: ‘The impression I got was that he was a very 
frightened man – even hinting that there were others in the background.’

Former shadow home secretary David 
Davis said Mr Mitchell had been the victim of ‘a really serious 
injustice’ and should be restored to the ministerial ranks.

He said: ‘This is a shocking 
revelation that a police officer seems to have masqueraded as a civilian
– more than seems to, I’ve seen the emails and clearly did so – and 
acted in a way which effectively completely undermined Mr Mitchell in 
the eyes of the Prime Minister and the rest of Downing Street right at 
the point they were making the decision: do we support him or not?’

Mr Mitchell used freedom of information laws to obtain a copy of CCTV footage which he says contradicts the official police report of the incident

The email is littered with 
grammatical errors and spelling mistakes, including a reference to Mr 
Mitchell’s ‘digesting behaviour’.

The author claims to have been 
showing his nephew from Hong Kong around London when he witnessed the 
clash between Mr Mitchell and police officers.

He went on: ‘Imagine to our horror 
when we heard MR MITCHELL shout very loudly at the police officers 
guarding “YOU (expletive blacked out) PLEBES !!” and “YOU THINK YOU RUN 
THE (expletive blacked out) COUNTRY” and just continued to shout 
obscenities at the poor police officers.’

The account in the leaked police log 
of the clash also states that there were ‘several members of the public 
present opposite the pedestrian gate’. They were said to have been 
‘visibly shocked’ by the language Mr Mitchell used.

But CCTV footage suggests there were 
only a few passers-by while the confrontation was taking place – and 
that none of them appeared to be interested in what was going on.

The CCTV footage is silent, making it
impossible to know what Mr Mitchell said, although it appears to have 
been only a brief exchange.

Cabinet Secretary, Jeremy Heywood

Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood was under fire last night over an ‘incompetent’ investigation into police claims that Andrew Mitchell called them ‘plebs’ during an angry confrontation in Downing Street.

Sir Jeremy, Britain’s most powerful civil servant, was asked to carry out an investigation into the explosive claims in September after a police account was leaked to the Press, and Downing Street was passed two emails claiming to be from a witness to the event.

Yesterday it emerged that Sir Jeremy had viewed the CCTV evidence that casts doubt on the version of events provided by both the police at the scene and the fabricated evidence in the email sent by another officer posing as a member of the public.

Number 10 said Sir Jeremy concluded that he ‘could not be confident that the evidence in the emails was reliable’.

But, incredibly, he did not draw any conclusions about the accuracy of the police log – or even ask to look at it.

Sir Jeremy told the Prime Minister that the CCTV footage contradicted police claims that the clash with Mr Mitchell was witnessed by a number of ‘shocked’ onlookers stood at the gates of Downing Street. But neither man took the issue further with the police.

Sir Jeremy went to ground yesterday, pulling out of a Whitehall event at which he would have faced questions from the Press.

Former shadow home secretary David Davis said the investigation was ‘not exactly Sherlock Holmes’. He added: ‘All the investigations did not go to the heart of the matter. Look at the CCTV, see whether it is consistent with the allegations made, consistent with what’s been said. It plainly wasn’t.’

Margaret Curran, a member of Labour’s Shadow Cabinet, said: It looks as if the so-called witness statement was not properly interrogated and I have to say… I do think that does speak of an incompetent inquiry undertaken by Number 10.’

Downing Street denied that the investigation had been botched. ‘The Prime Minister’s view is that reasonable inquiries were made,’ Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said. ‘Its conclusion was that one couldn’t be confident that the evidence in the emails was reliable, including on the basis of a number of inconsistencies with the CCTV footage.

‘There clearly remains a genuine difference of view about what words were actually used… the review was of the e-mail evidence that was submitted to us.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
