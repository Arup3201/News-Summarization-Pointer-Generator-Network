Tragedy: Lily sustained serious head injuries and 
was airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary shortly after 8.30am, but doctors were unable to 
save her and she died hours later

A mother has been left devastated after her six-year-old daughter was hit and killed by a Land Rover as she crossed the road to see her grandfather.

Jenna Hatfield was taking Lily to school yesterday morning when the little girl decided to go and greet her grandparents, who she hadn't seen for a few days.

As they stepped onto the road, which has a 30mph speed limit, a silver 4x4 turned into the road and hit Lily.

She sustained serious head injuries and 
was airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary shortly after 8.30am, but doctors were unable to 
save her and she died hours later.

Today, Ms Hatfield, 31, wept as she read tributes left in the street in the Wibley area of Bradford, West Yorkshire, by relatives, friends and neighbours.

Paying tribute, Lily's father Jack Davies said his daughter will 'never be forgotten'.

Mr Davies said: 'I would just like to say she was a beautiful, blonde haired little girl, who was doing very well at school. She will never be forgotten.

'I would like to say thank you to everyone who has brought flowers.'

Lily’s uncle Leon Robinson said: '[She was] really bubbly, kind and generous.

'She was very friendly and polite. Nothing worse than this could have happened, she had never done any harm to anyone.'

While the little girl’s grandfather John Laird later said: 'Lily was a special, beautiful little angel.

'She was so lovely and she loved life.

'She was crossing the road outside our home to come and see us before she went to school.

'The last time we saw her was Sunday. We planted flowers together in the garden.

'When she left, she told me she loved us lots. I told her I loved her too. She was such an amazing little girl.

'I don’t know how this has happened.

Tragic: Jenna Hatfield, mother of six-year-old Lily who was killed by a passing car as she crossed the road to greet her grandfather before school

Family: Lily's uncle Tom Laird and grandparents visit the tributes lain by neighbours at the street in Bradford

Moving: One note to the little girl, who lived nearby, read, 'Princess Lily, Sleep tight angel'

'We would like to thank everyone for all their help and the police officers who stayed with us and were so supportive. They went beyond the call of duty.'

Another uncle Tom Laird said: 'RIP to my beautiful niece. Uncle Tommy loves you and always will.

'We’re all just so upset. We wanted to come back to where it happened but it’s so hard. We can’t describe the grief we are going through.'

Other tributes left on bouquets and hand-made cards read: 'Such a sad loss to a beautiful princess.

'Today Heaven gained an angel. RIP little Lilly.

'Princess Lily, sleep tight angel.'

The
 schoolgirl, a member of Bradford South Scouts, was a pupil at nearby 
Stocks Lane Primary school and had moved to a house just metres from the
 accident scene about three months ago.

Sam
 Malynowsky was working on block paving a front drive on Beacon Road 
only yards from the incident and said: 'I heard it happen and saw a 
woman screaming. I did not see it.

Loving: Bradford South Scouts, of which Lily was a member, also left a message, flowers, and a scout scarf

Appeal: As residents call for stricter speed limits, the police appeal to find witnesses of the incident yesterday

Scene: This is the road where Lily crossed to greet her grandfather before she was struck to the ground

'I had to run next door to get an ambulance. They were doing CPR on her.'

Another witness, Mark Wright, heard screams and rushed to help.

Mr Wright, 31, said: 'I was just leaving my house and heard a big bang. I’ve never heard anything like it. The mum was screaming for help. I ran into the road and felt her pulse.

'I couldn’t feel anything so I called an ambulance. I followed their instructions to give her CPR and mouth to mouth. I didn’t know Lily but the whole area has been affected. It’s so sad.'

Despite warnings of speed cameras on the road, residents say there is a heavy flow of traffic, with cars often travelling at speed.

Residents are now calling for a petition to be made demanding strict speed restrictions to be put in place.

The road was closed for several hours while emergency services and accident investigators carried out a detailed examination of the scene.

A spokesperson for West Yorkshire Police appealed for witnesses to the incident as police continue to investigate.
