For those lucky enough, or patient enough, to get into Yayoi Kusama's latest exhibition, I Who Have Arrived in Heaven at New York's David Zwirner Gallery, they have just 45 seconds to capture the moment.

Only one person at a time is permitted into the exhibition's Infinity Mirrored Room - The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away, lined with colored LED bulbs.

But despite the nearly eight-hour-long wait to get into the exhibition, both tourists and eager New Yorker's alike are lining up in order to take just one envy-inducing selfie.

Currently, there are 2,586 hashtags for #DavidZwirner on Instagram, 1,045 for #DavidZwirnerGallery, and 1,354 for #IHaveArrivedinHeaven.

The average wait to get into the gallery can run anywhere from four hours on a weekday, and double that on a weekend. And with the exhibition's last day, December 21, fast approaching, the line is set to get even longer.

'The line is definitely getting longer,' David Zwirner Gallery's manager Anita Ragusa told MailOnline, adding that it is several hours long before they even open the doors.

She advises that people 'bundle up and arrive as early as possible' to catch the exhibition before it closes at midday on Saturday. 'The earliest that someone has lined up is 7.30am,' she added.

Encompassing a cube-shaped, mirror-paneled room that features a shallow reflecting pool as its floor, The Infinity Mirrored Room features hundreds of multicolored LED lights are suspended at varying heights from the ceiling.

They flicker on and off in a strobe-like effect, producing an illumination of the space and a repetitive pattern of reflections that suggest endlessness
 'and ultimately invoke concepts of life and death,' the exhibition's press notes explained.

The exhibition's second most photographed mirrored room, Love Is Calling, also known as 'the tentacle room,' where phallic forms  resemble large polka-dot sea urchins, is also a main draw.

But the show also features 27 new large-scale paintings alongside a recent video installation by the 84-year-old Japanese artist, which span the gallery's two adjacent locations on 19th street in Chelsea. Here there is no line.

Kusama’s work has transcended two of the most important art movements of the second half of the twentieth century: pop art and minimalism.

Her career spans paintings, performances, room-size presentations, outdoor sculptural installations, literary works, films, fashion, design, and interventions within existing architectural structures.

The exhibition’s title, I Who Have Arrived In Heaven, aims to reflect the artist’s long-standing interest in cosmic realms, while at the same time presenting a link to her artistic production from the past six decades.
