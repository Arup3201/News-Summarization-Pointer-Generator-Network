Officials at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant are building a mile-long wall of ice to prevent radioactive water from leaking into the Pacific Ocean.

More than three years after the March 2011 meltdowns, the Fukushima plant is still plagued by a massive amount of contaminated water.

Repeated leaks from storage tanks and other mishaps have hampered a decommissioning effort that is expected to take decades.

Workers place pipes into the ground around the tsunami-crippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in a bid to create an 'ice wall' around the plant to prevent contamination

The pipes being sunk into the ground will be filled with liquid coolant which will freeze the surrounding earth in the hopes that this will decrease the amount of water seeping into plants

Experts from Tepco - which owns the site - are freezing earth around the station to create an underground 1.4km wall of ice.

The technique will work by flooding the damaged reactors with vast amounts of water in order to keep them cool. The water will become radioactive, Al Jazeera reports.

Officials said they have already tested the technique but that the water had failed to freeze the earth sufficiently.

The wall, stretching 0.9miles and nearly 100 feet deep, will be set up around reactors 1 to 4 at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, which suffered multiple meltdowns following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

Workers will insert a line of pipes into the ground that circulate liquid as cold as -40C - causing the earth around them to freeze.

As well as preventing polluted water from escaping the plant, the wall will also block groundwater from flowing into the buildings' basements and mixing with highly radioactive water leaks from the melted cores.

Earlier this year, Dale Klein, a former U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission chairman who now heads a supervisory panel for TEPCO, said he was not convinced the 'ice wall' is the best way to prevent radioactive water from escaping the plant.

He also claimed the Government and TEPCO should review the plan to balance risk and benefit to see whether they should spend the money elsewhere.

'Any time you make a decision, it should be based on current, relevant science, and you have to strike a balance between science and policy,' he said.

'At the end of the day, it may be a good alternative. But I'm just not convinced.'

Akiro Ono, the plant's manager, told Al Jazeera the latest effort to construct the ice wall was working.

'The ice wall itself has been tested. And in those cases we've seen that the ground itself does freeze so I myself am not that worried that it will not go well,' Ono said.
