Three Al-Jazeera English journalists serving lengthy prison sentences in Egypt will face a retrial. 

The appeals court in Cairo will now decide the fate of Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy, Australian journalist Peter Greste and Egyptian Baher Mohamed.

However, they were not granted bail at the short hearing at the Court of Cassation today. The men have been held since December 2013.

Their arrests came after the overthrow of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood member. 

The three journalists did not attend the brief hearing that began around 9am local time, but defence lawyers said they believed a retrial for the men would be held within a month. 

Defence attorney Mostafa Nagy said: 'They will not be released until they appear before the new chamber, which will decide whether to release them or not.'

Speaking after the hearing, Lois Greste, Peter Greste's mother, said  the verdict was 'not as good as we hoped'.

Adel Fahmy said he had hoped his brother, Mohamed Fahmy, would be freed today. 

'I hoped for more today' he added.

Marwa Omara, the fianceé of Mohamed Fahmy, told Sky News the families were disappointed they had not been released ahead of the retrial.

She said her fianceé was in poor health with hepatitis B, but in 'high spirits'.

'He's just a journalist who was doing his job,'she told Sky News today.

'They were accused of being members of the Muslim Brotherhood, fabricating news and harming national security, and calling for a civil war in Egypt. 

'All these accusations are faulty and there is no evidence whatsoever - we don't understand why they are in prison.'

Mohamed Fahmy and Peter Greste were sentenced to seven years in prison at their initial trial, while Baher Mohamed got 10 years - three more because he was found with a spent bullet casing. 

Rights groups dismissed the trial as a sham and foreign countries, including the U.S., expressed  concern over the journalists' detention.

Authorities accused Qatar-based Al-Jazeera of acting as a mouthpiece for the Brotherhood. The station denied the accusations and said the journalists were doing their job.

At trial, prosecutors offered no evidence backing accusations the three falsified footage to foment unrest.

Instead, they showed edited news reports by the journalists, including Islamist protests and interviews with politicians.

Other footage submitted as evidence had nothing to do with the case, including a report on a veterinary hospital and Peter Greste's past reports out of Africa. 

Egyptian authorities offered no immediate comment on the ruling.

The Court of Cassation, Egypt's highest appeal tribunal, only reviews the lower court's proceedings, not the case itself.

Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi also has the power to pardon or deport the foreigners under a new law, whether or not the court grants the appeal. 

That would allow Peter Greste to go home and Mohamed Fahmy to go to Canada if he drops his Egyptian nationality. Baher Mohamed's case would remain uncertain as he holds only Egyptian citizenship.

A recent thaw in relations between Qatar and Egypt has seen Al-Jazeera shut down its Egyptian affiliate, which dedicated much of its coverage to Islamist protests since Morsi's overthrow. 

Last month, El-Sissi said  a presidential pardon for the three was being 'examined' and would be granted only if it was 'appropriate for Egyptian national security'.
