A rare solar eclipse has swept across the globe - captivating millions of people and plunging parts of Africa, Europe and America into darkness.

The spectacle, described by NASA as a 'rare hybrid eclipse', saw the Sun either totally or partially blocked by the Moon depending on location.

Skywatchers in central Africa had the best view - with a complete eclipse lasting for up to one minute.

Sunrise: An 'annular' version of the spectacle could be seen in the Queens borough of New York this morning

Unusual: The rare eclipse, pictured as it swept across the Canary Islands, saw the Sun either totally or partially blocked by the Moon depending on location

It was first seen in the US this morning - before sweeping east across the Atlantic Ocean and Africa.

Some areas witnessed a total blackout, while others experienced an 'annular' - or partial - version of the rare event.

It was the first hybrid eclipse in more than 150 years - with the last recorded on November 20, 1854.

It is not predicted to happen again until October 17, 2172.

Astronomy enthusiasts in the west African nation of Gabon had a peak view of the eclipse as it swept over a path nearly 37 miles wide.

They wore protective glasses as they gazed at the marvel, which was visible for about 60 seconds in the capital, Libreville.

Areas in northern Kenya also boasted stunning views - attracting hundreds of tourists eager to view a total blackout.

Members of Kenyan tribes - including the Turkana and Rendile tribes - were among those to turn up to admire the rare event.

They donned colourful tribal clothing, 
as well as a range of protective eyewear - including welding goggles, 
sunglasses, photo negatives and filters.

However, the complete solar eclipse was very brief - only lasting for around 15 seconds.

In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni joined dozens of children at Owiny Primary School in Pakwach to view the total eclipse.

And for once, Sebastian Vettel wasn't the centre of attention as he raced past an annular version of the spectacle during the Abu Dhabi Formula One Grand Prix.

The German star was shunned by dozens of fans at the Yas Marina racetrack in Abu Dhabi as they turned their gaze to the sky.

Partial
views were also available in New York, Israel and southern Europe - 
however, some of these were hampered by cloudy weather conditions.

The greatest total eclipse - lasting more than one minute - took place about 205 miles south-west of Liberia in the Atlantic Ocean, according to scientists.

Rare: It was the first hybrid eclipse since November 20, 1854. The next is predicted on October 17, 2172

Experts had warned skywatchers not to look directly Sun with the naked eye.

In a total eclipse, the Moon completely blocks out the Sun - casting a shadow on the Earth's surface - while an annular version occurs when the Moon is at its farthest from the Earth and is too small to completely cover the Sun.

In this event, a halo of sunlight - known as a 'ring of fire' - is still visible around the Moon.
