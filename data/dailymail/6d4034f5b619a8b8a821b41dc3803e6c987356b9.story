Revealed: Paul Walker, who made millions of dollars from the Fast & Furious franchise, was forced to live on the streets in college

A social worker has revealed for the first time about the impact Paul Walker’s stint on the streets had on his life.

Ken Williams met the Fast and Furious star nearly five years ago when Paul and business partner Brandon Birtell came to him with the idea of doing a documentary about the homeless problem in Paul’s hometown of Santa Barbara, California.

It was only after discussing the issue in depth that Paul and Brandon both revealed they lived on the streets as students. The 40-year-old, who tragically lost his life in a car crash on November 30, studied Marine Biology at California Community College.

Ken says: ‘Brandon and Paul were homeless for a while in college and related to the issue. Brandon mentioned that he had been living out his car and a lot of students lived out of cars or in homeless shelters, they still do now, as they can’t afford the tuition fees, there’s no such thing as food stamps, and rents are so high.

‘They said it was for a brief time and they knew it was a world of difference to the people that live on the streets for virtually their whole life.

'But this made them really interested in the subject, it bothered them, and they picked Santa Barbara, where you see it all the time. There are so many mentally ill people on the streets, it’s heartbreaking.’

The sounds of high-performance car engines filled the air Sunday as more than 5,000 fans, friends and car enthusiasts headed to the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita to pay tribute to Walker at the site where the 'Fast & Furious' actor died in a car crash.

The memorial, planned through social media, was scheduled to begin at noon, but mourners began arriving hours beforehand to leave flowers, candles, stuffed animals and other tributes.

After speaking to Ken, who’s been a social worker and campaigner in the area for the last 35 years, they realized the problem was much deeper and more complex than they could ever imagine.

The trio filmed for a year in 2009 centering on four people – three women and a blind old man called 'Pops' – who were sleeping rough and being cared for by Ken and his team.

More than 5,000 people came to the gathering, which was planned on social media. It was set to begin at noon Sunday, but hundreds of people lined up hours early

‘They wanted to follow me around, as they wanted to see the homeless through their eyes. They didn’t want the people who were being filmed to be conscious of it.

They wanted to concentrate on the town as it has this huge homeless population and it also has this massive wealth. We have a city as rich as Santa Barbara and they let Pops live on the streets. Unbelievable.

‘I found Pops on the streets and we had to carry him into the homeless shelter. Most people don’t want to touch the homeless; they’re like lepers. But Brandon was the one who lifted him up and took him on his shoulders to take him to the shelter.

‘The homeless are treated like a hidden wound and it grated on the guys that there is all this wealth in the area, all these celebrities, and also Third World poverty, which everyone just blindly accepts.

‘You just don’t usually get that empathy out of Hollywood. We have lots of celebrities who live here and you don’t get that sort of compassion.’

Even though Paul was also busy filming the third installment of the Fast and Furious franchise, he was still heavily involved in producing the documentary and even had time to turn up to Ken’s book launch, a novel about a Vietnam veteran.

‘In the middle of filming, I released a book called China White and, out of nowhere, both Brandon and Paul turn up to the launch. Paul’s in jeans and a baseball cap, he was just so unassuming.

'But he said he understood the book, as his dad is a Vietnam vet. I couldn’t believe, who am I? I’m a no one.

‘But that’s Paul. They were doing this documentary and Paul was having to commute from Brazil where he was filming Fast and Furious. They really left their comfort zone to do this. They’d never done anything like it and it wasn’t going to get them any kudos.

‘For Paul, I go back to how humble he was. He had all this other stuff going on, but he wanted to do this, it speaks volumes. It was so chaotic and difficult to do.

'I give both of them credit, there’s no more controversial subject in America, and they wanted to reach out as best they could, and they took time out to do it. They had no Hollywood ego.

'Three hundred people have died on Santa Barbara streets from the likes of hypothermia and just plain giving up. You get wet and you’re cold all night, you use drugs or drink so you don’t feel it and forget all your problems. No one cares - but they did.’

Unbelievably, Paul, Brandon and Ken all received hate mail for the work they did with the homeless. 

‘It’s weird, people hate the homeless and people were writing to me, saying they loathed me. When we did this film, we got a lot of criticism,’ explains Ken.

‘We had hateful comments, which gave me an even higher opinion of them that these guys from Hollywood were bothering to do this.

‘People were saying that the homeless are like pigeons, and you know what happens with them... you feed them, then the pigeons will overpopulate. They’d say it’s time to "thin the herd," which means when there’s too much of a herd, then they bring the hunters into kill them.

‘Others would say we don’t have a homeless problem, we have a Ken Williams problem. It’s disgusting.’

When the film, called 'Shelter,' was eventually premiered at in July 2009 and they held a charity fundraiser for the Casa Esperanza Homeless Shelter, which Ken has worked tirelessly for decades.

‘Paul’s like an angel compared to most in Hollywood. They never wanted special treatment and they put their neck on their line when there’s so much prejudice against the homeless. When the film came out, they put me down as co-producer. For me it was unbelievable, that means a lot,’ says Ken. 

As Paul knew from the beginning, Shelter would never even stand a chance of hitting the cinemas, but he was only interested in making a difference to the Santa Barbara community, says Ken.

He adds: ‘It’s still being shown in classrooms, college campuses and community events, it’s made a real impact. 

'We wanted to break the stereotypes and see them as human beings, demystify the homeless, and try to look at ways of solving the problem. They’re so badly treated - if you’re poor, you’re scum. It chipped away at the prejudice.

‘This says something about the problem that two of the four homeless people we filmed are now dead. It was amazing what Paul and Brandon did and if it makes more people take notice, then it was worth it.’
