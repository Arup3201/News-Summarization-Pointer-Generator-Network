A house which was once home to revered Victorian painter James Whistler, creator of the famous 'Whistler's mother' masterpiece, is on the market for rent at a lavish £2,500 per week.

The property, 101 Cheyne Walk, was the first of Whistler's homes in Chelsea, where he lived and worked for much of his career.

It even boasts the the original fireplace which can be seen in another of his paintings, Symphony in White no. 2, which is a portrait of the artist's mistress stood in a flowing lace dress.

Steeped in history: 101 Cheyne Walk is where Whistler created much of his work including the Nocturnes

The painting was finished in 1864 and went on to be displayed at the Royal Academy the following year.

Such
was the importance of the resident, there is even a statue of Whistler 
at the end of Cheyne Walk, just a stroll from the available property.

The sculpture by Nicholas 
Dimbleby, stands outside no. 96 and was commissioned by the Chelsea Arts
Club, which Whistler helped to found.

The house is described by agents Strutt & Parkers as a 'unique and traditional Grade II listed family house located in the heart of Chelsea with River Thames views.

It
comes with three bedrooms and three bathrooms, three receptions and a 
kitchen and also comes with a private garden.

The proximity to the river is believed to be one of Whistler's favourite things about the street, where he had four homes throughout his life.

His famous Nocturnes series features scenes in and around the river, with dim views of the riverband and Battersea bridge.

He
would sketch the Thames either from the embankment with his work 
illuminated by a gas light, or by rowing out onto the river and sketch in
complete darkness.

Masterpiece: The painting which the artist is most famous for is actually called 'Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1: Portrait of the Artist's Mother', but is commonly known as 'Whistler's Mother'

Spacious: The property boasts three bedrooms, three receptions rooms and three bathrooms

Luxury: The property's three en suite bathrooms make it an attractive home for a large family

Such
was the difficulty of this, he would train himself to memorise scenes 
as accurately as possible, and then reproduce them in his studio.

As well as living at 101 and 96, Whistler also lived in number 21 and 74 where he died.

Many
of Whistler’s house moves were forced through financial troubles. 
Indebted, in 1878 he left No. 96 after being embroiled in a libel 
lawsuit.

The
next year he had to leave the White House on Tite Street, which had 
been designed for him personally. In 1879 was bankrupt with debts of 
£4,500.

He left No. 21 Cheyne Walk in the 1890s when he was unable to pay the his rent.

Whistler died at No. 74 Cheyne Walk, and his funeral was held at Chelsea Old Church

Secluded: Despite being in the heart of Chelsea, the house comes with its own private garden which is shielded by trees and hedges

One time studio: Whistler would memorise scenes from the Thames before returning to the house to paint

Pricey: The historic property will not come cheap for future tenants who will pay around £2,500 per week
