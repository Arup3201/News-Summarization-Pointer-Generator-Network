A rollercoaster end concluded a tough week as Wall Street had its busiest day in more than a year.

More than 15 billion shares traded and the Dow Jones had furious swings as it covered more than 400 points, but all three major U.S. markets closed within one per cent of their opening value.

A moment of relief from problems in the U.S. came early today after the government published better- than-expected jobs figures and President Barack Obama promised: ‘Things are going to get better’.

The intense selling this week reflects
 frustration with sluggish economic growth and politicians' inability to
 address pressing concerns over high public debt in Europe and the U.S.

‘Fears about the European debt crisis,
 the global economy and earnings have taken a heavy toll on investor 
sentiment,’ said Joe Cusick, senior market analyst at Chicago brokerage 
optionsXpress.

The Dow Jones plunged 5.8 per cent 
this week, its biggest weekly fall since March 2009, while the S&P 
fell 7.2 per cent and the Nasdaq crashed 8.1 per cent – their biggest 
falls since November 2008.

Falls this week have been partly down a
 loss of confidence stemmed from responses to the growing threat to 
large euro-zone economies Spain and Italy and banks' exposure to their 
troubled debt.

Non-farm payrolls data in the U.S. 
showed a gain of 117,000 jobs in July - higher than expected - while the
 country's unemployment rate dipped from 9.2 per cent in June to 9.1 per
 cent in July.

The unemployment rates were 
anticipated nervously by investors as they were seen as a good means of 
determining whether the U.S. economy was indeed headed for a double-dip 
recession.

But Todd Schoenberger, managing 
director at LandColt Trading, said he was ‘surprised’ by the job 
figures, which ‘don’t seem to add up’. ‘Come on -tell me who these new 
hires are?’ he asked CNBC.

The Dow Jones rose 60.93 points, or 0.54 per cent, to end the week down overall at 11,444.61.

But the Standard & Poor's 500 
Index edged down just 0.69 of a point, or 0.06 per cent, to finish at 
1,199.38. The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 23.98 points, or 0.94 per 
cent, to close at 2,532.41.

Among individual stocks, Bank of 
America shares fell 7.5 per cent to $8.17, off a 52-week low at $8.03, 
and Citigroup dropped 3.9 per cent to $33.44, off a 52-week low at 
$31.81.

Italian Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi said his country will introduce a constitutional principle of
 a balanced budget in an effort to reduce debt levels.

Helping the market erase hefty losses 
in trading, the European Central Bank was said to be ready to buy 
Italian and Spanish bonds if Mr Berlusconi commits to bringing forward 
specific reforms.

But a possible S&P downgrade of 
U.S. debt after the market close pressured stocks throughout the day. 
The recent steep sell-off has put all three major indexes in negative 
territory for the year.

Peter Costa, president of Empire Executions, said he is concerned about the market’s sensitivity.

‘When news comes out, the market will 
selloff or trade up in a hurry,’ he told CNBC. ‘I don’t think I’ve seen a
 market this skittish in a very long time.’

Meanwhile, European shares saw their 
biggest weekly decline in nearly three years amid worries about weak 
global growth and further contagion in the euro zone debt crisis.

'There is 
no doubt this has been a tumultuous year. Recently markets around the globe 
have taken a bumpy ride. We are going to get through this. 
Things are going to get better. And we are going to get there together'

President Barack Obama

The volatile session on Friday follows a disastrous day for the markets yesterday.

Panic tore through global financial 
centres as fears grew that the U.S. is staring at another recession and 
that Europe's sovereign debt crisis is swallowing two of its largest 
economies.

The Dow Jones and Standard & 
Poor’s both tumbled more than four per cent on Thursday and the Nasdaq 
lost five per cent in the worst stock-market selloff since the financial
 crisis.

Thursday’s decline was the ninth-worst
 ever by points for the Dow, and it had lost almost $1.9trillion in 
market value had gone in just two weeks.

Amid such economic turmoil, President 
Obama spoke today in an attempt to reassure a nervous public. 'There is 
no doubt this has been a tumultuous year,' he said.

'Recently markets around the globe 
have taken a bumpy ride,’ he added. 'We are going to get through this. 
Things are going to get better. And we are going to get there together.'

‘For many 
traders this week has felt like the start of the banking crisis in 2008,
 which would go some way to explaining the panic selling we have seen'

Will Hedden, IG Index

After a tense week in which Mr Obama 
finally signed off emergency legislation to prevent the U.S. defaulting 
on its debt, volatility has spread to markets throughout the world.

The erratic market figures have come 
amid concerns about the debt deal’s impact, with projections suggesting 
just how little it will wipe off of the enormous amount America will owe
 by 2021.

While the deal is expected to save 
$2.5trillion by 2021 - a seemingly huge amount - it is not so impressive
 when viewed in the context of a projected debt by then of almost 
$30trillion.

'We are continuing to be bombarded by 
worries about the global economy,' Bill Stone, chief investment 
strategist at PNC Financial said.

Another trader said the turmoil was 
reminiscent of the start of the banking crisis in 2008 when shares 
plunged day after day before the global economy fell into recession.

‘Investors are defiantly pessimistic,’
 said Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown 
Stockbrokers in London. ‘It is nearing capitulation, a mass sell-off.’

After a lengthy partisan battle over the debt deal, the Senate passed the debt bill with a 74-26 vote on Tuesday.

After Mr Obama signed the deal and 
attempted to raise hopes of avoiding catastrophe, attention returned to 
the political name-calling which has epitomised who politicians have 
handled the crisis.

President Obama had faced furious 
reaction to his last-minute deal, with experts correctly predicting the 
agreement would be a means of hitting middle classes with tax hikes 
'through the back door'.

Will Hedden, a trader at IG Index, 
said on Thursday: ‘Financial markets are still not convinced that 
politicians have a strategy for dealing with the increased perception of
 risk around Italy and Spain.

‘For many traders this week has felt 
like the start of the banking crisis in 2008, which would go some way to
 explaining the panic selling we have seen.’
