The wife of Rolf Harris has spoken of her concern for her husband's health since his arrest on suspicion of sexual offences.

Alwen Hughes said the legendary entertainer has struggled to sleep since he was quizzed and later arrested by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile sex scandal.

The 83-year-old denies the allegations and has not been seen in public since they were first reported last week.

Welsh sculptress and jeweller Alwen, who married Harris in 1958, has told a friend how worried she is for her husband, who has suffered depression in the past.

She told the friend: 'My poor husband. It's terrible, we've been really worrying about it.

'We've both been having sleepless nights over it all', according to The Sunday Mirror.

The couple have one daughter, Bindi, who is also an artist.

Harris was quizzed by Operation Yewtree detectives in November and arrested three weeks ago.

The friend, who says he has known the couple for more than 50 years, was quoted in The Sunday Mirror as saying: 'Rolf is a lovely, loyal devoted husband and father and I can't imagine him ever doing anything to tarnish his image.'

Metropolitan Police detectives now plan to fly to Harris' native Australia to interview two potential witnesses, according to the Sydney Sunday Telegraph.

Harris – a favourite of the Queen – had been the only high-profile Operation Yewtree suspect not to have been identified by the mainstream media.

Lawyers at London law firm Harbottle & Lewis had sent threatening letters to newspapers in a bid to stop the arrest being reported.

They cited Lord Justice Leveson’s controversial proposal that the public should be prevented from knowing the names of arrested suspects in all but ‘exceptional’ circumstances.

One publisher was told there was ‘no public interest’ in revealing his identity, it was claimed.

Yesterday Harris kept silent after The Sun revealed that he had been arrested over historic sex abuse allegations.

The aggressive tactics used by his lawyers, who declined to comment yesterday, deepened the row over ‘secret arrests’.

The tersely written letters from Harbottle & Lewis were sent amid mounting concern in the media about plans to ban the public from knowing the names of police suspects who have been arrested but not yet charged.

Detectives are planning to travel to Australia to interview potential witnesses into the Harris allegations

The allegations do not involve disgraced Savile, who last year – following his death – was revealed to be Britain’s worst paedophile. Harris’s accuser is a woman who claims she was sexually assaulted by him when she was a teenager.

Although he vehemently denies the allegations, he has declined to issue a formal statement.

Channel 5 has pulled Harris's programmes pending the outcome of the police investigation.

‘While this legal matter involving Rolf Harris is on-going we have removed Olive the Ostrich and the repeats of Rolf’s Animal Clinic from the schedule,’ a spokesman said.

At last summer’s Diamond Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace, Harris famously led the crowd – including Princess Anne – in an impromptu rendition of Two Little Boys, his 1969 Christmas No 1 hit.

He is also famed for his 1957 song Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport.

Harris's arrest comes after the arrests of pop star Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr, DJ Dave Lee Travis, publicist Max Clifford and comedian Jim Davidson.

Starr, Travis, Clifford and Davidson have all publicly denied any wrong-doing and gave statements after their arrests.

Critics say Yewtree, set up in the 
aftermath of the Savile scandal, has turned into a ‘celebrity 
witch-hunt’ and police are arresting suspects on flimsy evidence.

Police
 searched his large, gated home in Bray, Berkshire, on November 24 while
 he was out of the country and took away computer equipment and other 
items.

Harris was first 
interviewed under caution – but not arrested – over alleged sex offences
 on November 29 after attending a police station by appointment.

On March 28 police took the decision to formally arrest him over the allegations.

In February, he made a rare stage appearance at London’s Southbank Centre.
