A football fan suffered serious head injuries after being mowed down by a rival supporter in a hit-and-run.

Police are hunting a 'reckless and dangerous' motorist who careered into a group of football fans in broad daylight - leaving one man with serious head injuries.

Detectives believe the driver may have targeted the rival fans after a row in a nearby pub minutes earlier.

The incident happened outside Rochdale train station at 2.45pm on Saturday as the group of friends made their way to the match between Rochdale and Port Vale at Spotland Stadium.

The vehicle, which is described as red with 62 plates, struck the Port Vale fans at the mini roundabout outside the train station and then sped off.

A 36-year-old man was left with a serious head injury. His condition is described as 'serious but stable'.

Another man, aged 52, suffered arm and hip injuries in the incident.

Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

DI Dave Sinclair said: 'This is an extremely serious offence and I would urge the driver to hand themselves in before we come knocking on their door.

The incident happened after Port Vale took on Rochdale and the Spotland Stadium in Rochdale. The game finished 2-2

'Whoever is responsible would appear not to have thought twice about deliberately driving into a group of men in the street.

'The victims were among a group of five men walking to the football stadium in Rochdale.

'One of the men is in a serious condition due to the apparent reckless and dangerous actions of this driver.

'Officers are currently working to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident, but it is believed that this is linked to an altercation that occurred earlier outside the Commercial Public House on Lower Tweedale Street in Rochdale.

'If anyone saw what happened, saw the car being driven away or knows who the driver is, please get in touch.'

If you have any information please contact Greater Manchester Police on 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

The match finished 2-2 after the home side grabbed a last minute equaliser.
