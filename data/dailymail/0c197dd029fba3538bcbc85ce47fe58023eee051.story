Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena, pictured, is the first doctor to go on trial for FGM in the UK

The first British doctor to stand trial accused of female genital mutilation has been made a ‘scapegoat’ for his hospital’s failings, it was claimed.

Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena, 32, is accused of carrying out the potentially deadly procedure on a young mother after helping to deliver her first child at the Whittington Hospital in north London.

But yesterday, Dharmasena’s defence team argued he had been ‘hung out to dry’ and should never have been put in the position he found himself in. 

His lawyer, Zoe Johnson QC, also questioned the Crown Prosecution Service’s decision to bring the case to trial.

She said the woman, who is known only as AB, should have been identified before the birth as a victim of FGM, which the court heard she had first undergone in Somalia.

This would have meant she was put on a special care ‘pathway’ with midwives who are experienced in dealing with such cases.

But this opportunity was missed, so when she arrived at the hospital in labour in November 2012, Dharmasena had to cut through stitches so the baby could be born.

He then claims he put a figure-of-eight stitch back in to stop the woman’s bleeding – but the court heard this procedure amounted to FGM.

‘If AB had followed the FGM pathway he would never have been in the situation he found himself in,’ Miss Johnson said.

Closing her case after two weeks of evidence, she added: ‘We do suggest that Dr Dharmasena has been hung out to dry and made a scapegoat for the Whittington Hospital and their failings.

‘There was a complete failure to pick up AB as someone who had suffered FGM. That failure by the midwife and hospital is at the root cause of all that has followed.

‘She should have been referred to a specialist FGM midwife. She was not. That was a serious failure. These are serious, systematic failings, none of which are Dr Dharmasena’s fault.’

The court heard that the woman had first undergone FGM when she was six years old. Her labia were cut and then stitched together, leaving her at risk of infection. She later married and in 2011, after moving to the UK, she had the procedure reversed and become pregnant.

Zoe Johnson, defending, told the court her client 'has been hung out to dry and made a scapegoat for the Whittington Hospital (pictured) and their failings'

The prosecution claim Dharmasena was encouraged to replace her stitches by a second defendant, Hasan Mohamed, 41, who was acting as the woman’s translator.

He is on trial alongside Dharmasena, accused of encouraging and assisting an offence.

Earlier, prosecutor Kate Bex claimed the doctor – who was a junior registrar in obstetrics and gynaecology at the time – had bowed to pressure from Mohamed and carried out FGM by stitching the woman back up to her ‘pre-delivery state’.

Making her closing speech to the jury yesterday, Miss Bex said: ‘The prosecution case is Dr Dharmasena, ordinarily a very good, caring and competent doctor, found himself in the position where Hasan Mohamed was interfering.

‘He kept coming over and insisting that AB’s anterior incision was repaired so as to put her back in the same situation she was in when she arrived.

‘Dr Dharmasena obeyed the patient’s wishes, but it was not clinically necessary or therefore connected with the labour and birth.

‘He did it the way he did because of Mr Mohamed’s insistence.’

However, Miss Johnson insisted her client was not a ‘quivering and trepidatious’ doctor who would give in to a patient’s demands, but an ‘honourable, honest and ethical man’.

Dharmasena, of llford, Essex, was suspended from his job in March 2014. He pleaded not guilty to one count of carrying out FGM.

Mohamed has denied aiding and abetting the procedure as well as an alternative count of encouraging and assisting the offence.

The case continues.
