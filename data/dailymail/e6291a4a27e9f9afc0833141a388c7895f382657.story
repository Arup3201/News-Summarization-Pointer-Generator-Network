Model-turned-TV star: Naomi Campbell is to mentor aspiring models in new Oxygen reality series The Face

Naomi Campbell is to star in a new reality series that will see her mentor aspiring models.

She will be one of three supermodel coaches on The Face, though the other two names are yet to be announced.

Each will embark on a global search for their chosen contestants, who will be competing to become the face of a major brand.

Miss Campbell, 41, who has fronted campaigns for Valentino and Ralph Lauren, as well as Hilton hotels and Dunkin' Donuts over the years,
is certainly well-equipped to give advice to the hopefuls - though her 
famously fiery temper promises some entertaining on-screen moments.

In a press release announcing the news, the supermodel said: 'With The Face the audience will get a real insiderâ€™s 
look at this exciting industry that has been so good to me.

'One lucky 
girl will become the face of a major brand.'

The show will air on Oxygen, the cable network that is already home to America's Next Top Model.

Rod Aissa, the network's senior VP for original programming and 
development, added: 'The Face is a fresh new series that delivers all 
the elements our 
audience craves: fashion, beauty and drama.

'Oxygen has been 
looking for the next ideation in the modeling genre and this project 
delivers it.'

Casting a supermodel host is certainly a winning formula that has proved successful in the case of Heidi Klum on Project Runway and Elle Macpherson on Britain's Next Top Model, not to mention model-mogul-Harvard graduate Tyra Banks.

News of The Face comes as America's Next Top Model is undergoing something of a revamp, after viewers dropped by 45per cent drop year-on-year.

Nigel Barker, Jay Manuel and J 
Alexander, who have all appeared on the long-running show since it began, have been axed.

Rumours suggest fashion blogger 
BryanBoy is in line to join Tyra's team, though there is no official 
word from the ANTM camp on who will be appearing in the next cycle.
