It's not the sort of bare-faced cheek usually seen in a genteel village.

But a six-year dispute over a 10ft strip of land between two millionaires reached a new low when one of the men dropped his trousers to ‘moon’ at his neighbours.

The astonishing rearguard action was the latest incident in an increasingly frenzied turf war between the men which has already led to a greenhouse being burnt down, a string of trees felled and accusations of people hiding in bushes taking secret photos.

Argument: Gerald Mead (pictured) and Mr Williams have been locked in a bitter dispute about the strip of land for six years

Land: Mr Mead had planted trees on the narrow strip of land between their two houses as he believed he owned it

Property developer Gerald Mead, 71, insists the three-yard gap between their properties in Kingswood, Surrey, belongs to him.

Mr Mead and his wife, Heather, planted trees on the land during their 19 years in the property.

But
neighbour Neville Williams, 53, the director of a company that services
Rolls-Royces and Bentleys, is equally adamant that the strip belongs to
him.

He claims a 
document from the Land Registry proves he is within his rights to remove
Mr Mead’s trees and put up a ‘conifer screen’ instead.

Caught on camera: Mr Williams admitted he did pull his trousers down but only 'after 18 months of Mrs Mead hiding in the bushes taking photos of me'

Row: Police have said they cannot resolve the dispute and have advised the two neighbours go to mediation

After a series of increasingly bitter rows, Mr Williams took things into his own hands this summer.

While his neighbours were on  holiday, he chopped down some of the trees planted by the Meads.

He then set fire to the trunks – but the blaze spread out of control and destroyed Mr Mead’s greenhouse.

Then last month, he pulled down his trousers to flash his bottom at Mr Mead’s garden – a moment that was captured on camera.

Destroyed: Mr Williams has apologised for inadvertently destroying Mr Mead's greenhouse when he set fire to the trunks of the trees he had chopped down

Accident: An attempt to burn severed trunks got out of hand, spread to more of the trees and destroyed Mr Mead's greenhouse

Mrs Mead, 69, said: ‘The grandkids were playing in the garden and I was just enjoying watching them.

‘Then he (Mr Williams) came out and there were a few words between him and the gardener.

‘Then Freddy, who is seven, shouted, “He’s showing his bum”.’

Exclusive: Kingswood, in Surrey, is one of Britain's wealthiest suburbs. Mr Mead's house is pictured on the left, while Mr Williams' house is on the right

Trees: Mr Williams described the trees as 'horrible', 'manky' and 'old' and said they needed 'taking down'

Mr
Williams admitted: ‘Yes, I did remove my trousers, but only after 18 
months of Mrs Mead hiding in the bushes taking photos of me.’ 

He added: ‘Common sense must prevail. It’s completely got out of proportion.’

He has now apologised for destroying his neighbours’ greenhouse and has offered to pay for it.

Mr
Mead is adamant that he does not want a conifer hedge, saying he 
‘didn’t move to a million-pound house for it to look like Sutton’, a 
reference to a nearby London suburb.

Police have spoken to both  parties and have referred the two men to mediation.
