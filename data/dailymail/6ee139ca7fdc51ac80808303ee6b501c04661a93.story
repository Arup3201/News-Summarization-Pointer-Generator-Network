More than 300 aeroplane passengers were delayed for 48 hours without proper food at an airport after a flight developed a technical fault.

The Airblue flight was due to fly from Manchester Airport to Islamabad in Pakistan, at 9.50pm on Friday - and passengers were fed chips and beans to keep them going during the delays.

Passengers spent Friday night in hotels in Manchester and then returned to the airport to wait for the flight again on Saturday - but were later told it was being delayed until 3pm yesterday.

Airline officials then offered to put up the irate passengers in a hotel some 80 miles away in Birmingham, West Midlands, because they said there were no rooms available in Manchester.

Most refused the offer and slept overnight in the airport, which is located south of Manchester city centre, only to find the plane again missed its take-off slot. The flight finally took off late last night.

But that meant delays for the passengers who were booked to go on that plane - who were told they would be delayed for 24 hours. Some travellers said that the delays had left families in tears.

Matthew Miller, 38, was originally due to catch a flight on Tuesday evening but it was cancelled. So when he turned up to catch the plane on Friday night, he was furious to find he was grounded again.

He said: ‘I’m a maths teacher and the 
term is about to start in Pakistan. I thought I’d be getting back in 
good time but as it is I’ll be lucky to get there by Monday. The mood is
terrible.

‘People are shouting and in tears. The airline just aren’t communicating with us - over the whole time they have given us about 40 minutes. The food is chips and beans.’

A passenger named Javed told BBC Five Live on Saturday night: ‘It has to be seen to be believed.

'There's 300 people here. Children, diabetics, non-English speaking people that can't even understand the tannoys. I'm seeing people making expensive phone calls to Pakistan. 

'I'm seeing people that cannot keep 
their fasts. I see people that have no access to food when it comes to 
opening their fasts. It is a shambles and an embarrassment to British 
society.

'To keep saying we will inform you in 
two hours, and in two hours they say: “We will inform you in two hours”.
I've chosen to eat virtually nothing because I didn't want to have 
chips and beans again.'

Many passengers spent Saturday night in Manchester Airport rather than travel to the accommodation offered by the airline about 80 miles away in Birmingham.

A Manchester Airport spokesman said: ‘They are working on the problem with the current aircraft. The passengers who were supposed to be on the 10pm flight on Sunday have been informed at home.’

‘The staff on the ground are doing their best to help sort out accommodation and food but the majority of the communication has to come from the airline. We are doing what we can.

‘Understandably passengers are frustrated and we can only apologise for the delay.’

Islamabad-based Airblue is Pakistan’s second biggest airline. Nobody was available to be contacted last night, although a spokesman previously said passengers were offered ‘every compensation’.

Standing around: Delays at London Heathrow Airport's Terminal One three months ago

Under new EU rules, airlines must pay compensation for cancelled or heavily delayed flights, unless there are 'extraordinary circumstances'.

This can include sudden severe weather events, such as a hurricane or something like the volcanic ash cloud episode of 2010.

The ruling that outlines these rights is Regulation (EC) 261/2004, which became law earlier this year. Compensation is around £210 for inter-EU flights of 930 miles or less, £330 for flights between 930 and 1,860 miles and £500 for other journeys.

It applies to any flight leaving an EU airport and any flight into the EU on an EU-based airline.

Passengers can claim by telling the airline their flight number, names and reason for the delay. If rejected, they can take their case to court.

In essence, if your flight is delayed by more than three hours, cancelled or overbooked, you may be able to claim.
