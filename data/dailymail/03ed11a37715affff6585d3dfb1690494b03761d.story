The jilted live-in girlfriend of French president Francois Hollande cost taxpayers at least £500,000 last year, it emerged today.

New figures released by Paris auditors show that Valerie Trierweiler, 49, enjoyed just as much of a lavish lifestyle as her predecessor Carla Bruni, the former supermodel.

As well as four bodyguards, Ms Trierweiler had five personal aides and made regular use of state planes and official homes.

Publicly available costs related to Ms Trierweiler add up to £381,000, but this figure does not include the salaries of the bodyguards as well as a range of other expenses.

Embarrassing: French President Francois Hollande gives ex-girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler a rose during his 2012 election campaign. New figures show the former First Lady cost the taxpayer £500,000 last year

When Mr Hollande dumped the feisty divorcee earlier this year for another lover, she moved into a luxurious state country house outside Paris with her mother and threw a party for friends. 

The figures will cause huge embarrassment to Mr Hollande, a Socialist who claims to dislike the rich.

Until now, the left-wing Ms Trierweiler has also claimed that she cost the taxpayer very little during her 18 months as first lady of France.

In a report entitled 'Spending connected with Madame Valerie Trierweiler', France's court of auditors states that all the staff positions created for her have now been closed.

Ms Trierweiler, who is also a member of the Socialist Party, was kicked out of the Elysee Palace after Mr Hollande was caught out sleeping with Julie Gayet, a 42-year-old actress.

Mr Hollande also used taxpayers' money to conduct his affair with Mr Gayet, hopping on the back of a state moped to travel to secret liaisons with at least two bodyguards of his own.

One security man was pictured delivering breakfast to the couple.

The president, a bachelor who has four children with his ecology minister Segolene Royale, now has no official partner.

Ms Trierweiler, who has spent most of her career working for Paris Match magazine, is now living in a flat in Paris and doing humanitarian work.
