QPR were so desperate to land Emmanuel Adebayor on loan on Monday that they offered to pay a staggering £75,000 a week of the forward’s salary.

Rangers made Adebayor their principle transfer deadline day target and were prepared to fork out most of his salary to sign him for the rest of the season.

Adebayor made it clear at Tottenham’s training ground on Monday morning that he had no intention of swapping life at White Hart Lane for a relegation battle.

West Ham were keen on Adeabyor, but wouldn't match Spurs chairman Daniel Levy's salary demands

Adebayor is paid £100,000 a week at Tottenham and chairman Daniel Levy was happy to do a deal with QPR on the terms offered to them on Monday morning.

When Adebayor refused to travel to Rangers, Levy refused to let him leave for West Ham when they offered to pay only 50 per cent of his salary.

Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino was among a number of staff desperate to see the back of him because he fears that he could disrupt the rhythm of the squad in the build up to the Capital One Cup final.

Spurs officials tried desperately to convince Levy to accept the Hammers’ proposal, but the chairman’s head had been turned by QPR’s outrageous offer earlier in the day.

The Hammers made their first enquiry for Adebayor at around 3pm on Monday and Pochettino was convinced that the forward would be moving to Upton Park for the rest of the season.

Levy, who has a difficult relationship with Hammers’ co-chairman David Sullivan and the chief executive Karren Brady, refused to do a deal at £50,000 a week, which is half of his salary.

The Spurs chairman, who has a reputation for being a ruthless negotiator, wanted the Hammers to up their bid for the former Manchester City, Real Madrid and Arsenal striker.

Instead he has been left with a disillusioned player and Pochettino is already trying to work out how to integrate the forward into his squad after a deadline day disaster.
