The BBC has accused supporters of Scottish independence of launching a lobbying campaign against presenter Andrew Marr about a live TV clash with Alex Salmond.

Messages posted online accused Mr Marr of being a ‘paid Tory employee’, an ‘establishment puppet’ and a ‘racist wee s****’.

Pro-independence supporters also took to Twitter to encourage people to complain to the BBC, after Mr Marr told the First Minister it would be ‘quite hard’ for Scotland to rejoin the European Union.

Clash: Sparks flew after BBC host Andrew Marr told First Minister Alex Salmond it would be 'quite hard' for an independent Scotland to rejoin the EU

On Sunday, senior Nationalists demanded ‘answers’ from the broadcaster and suggested editorial guidelines may have been breached, while one MP claimed Marr could face ‘consequences’.

During his Sunday morning show on BBC One, Mr Marr said of an independent Scotland’s membership of the EU: ‘I think it would be quite hard to get back in, I have to say.’

Mr Salmond immediately hit back during the interview, and demanded to know: ‘Is that an individual expression or is that an expression of the BBC?’

Glasgow-born Mr Marr insisted he was commenting having recently interviewed Jose Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president. Mr Barroso said it would be ‘extremely difficult, if not impossible’ for an independent Scotland to join the EU, highlighting the Spanish government’s refusal to recognise Kosovo’s declaration of independence.

Now the BBC has revealed it has found evidence of an organised lobbying campaign against Mr Marr.

The broadcaster declined to publish 
the number of complaints it has received about the interview after being
 approached by the Mail.

A 
spokeswoman said: ‘In this case, there is evidence of lobbying on the 
issue and we have a policy that we do not issue complaints figures when 
there is evidence of lobbying.'

A discussion on the Scottish National Party’s Facebook page about the interview saw several personal attacks on Mr Marr.

One user wrote: ‘Andrew Marr must be a paid Tory employee?’ Another said: ‘I used to like Andrew Marr but its clear he's become just another establishment puppet.’

Another message said: ‘Andrew Marr's interview with Salmond was a biased disgrace. Shame on him and his biased BBC. Will be interesting to see the grovelling they embark upon when we are Independant #YES’

A message posted later stated: ‘That was a shocking interview today! Marr should hang his head in shame. Expressing his opinion in such an off hand way then back tracking trying to cover his statement. He made it plain and clear, not to mention it was factually incorrect! He should be hammered for it.’

On Twitter Mr Marr was accused of a ‘cock up’ for showing ‘personal bias’.

Harry Fowler wrote: ‘Getting his arse handed to him by Salmond…must try harder Mr Marr, a lot f***ing harder.’

Mr Marr was also branded a 'self-important little weasel' and a 'racist wee s****' in comments on 
pro-independence online forum, the Telegraph reported. 

Others said they had complained to the BBC, and posted links to the official complaints page to encourage others to do the same.

Nationalist MSP Stewart Maxwell MSP, convener of the Scottish Parliament’s culture committee, said: ‘There are questions for the BBC to answer over their coverage of this issue.’

Pete Wishart MP, the party’s broadcasting spokesman, wrote on Twitter: ‘Thought Alex [Salmond] was very restrained in the face of all that nonsense. Think there'll be consequences for Marr, though.’

A spokesman for the BBC said: ‘Andrew himself made it clear on air that he had not been intending to express a personal opinion or that of the BBC, but was simply putting forward an argument from President Barroso who, as European Commission President, has an integral insight within the debate. The BBC's coverage of the Scottish referendum debate has been fair and balanced and we will continue to report on the story without fear or favour.’
