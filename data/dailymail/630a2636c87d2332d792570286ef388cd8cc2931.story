Team news

West Brom

West Brom are sweating on the fitness of strikers Brown Ideye and Victor Anichebe for Sunday's visit of Burnley.

Ideye injured his ankle scoring his first goal for the club in Wednesday's 3-2 Capital One Cup victory over Hull while Anichebe is struggling after a hernia operation.

Saido Berahino, who scored the winner against Hull, and Georgios Samaras are primed to start up front after coming on in mid-week.

Chris Baird is still suffering from the illness which kept him out against the Tigers and is likely to sit out the game.

Provisional squad: Foster, Myhill, Pocognoli, Gamboa, Dawson, Lescott, McAuley, Olsson, Yacob, Davidson, Wisdom, Morrison, Mulumbu, Gardner, Brunt, Blanco, Varela, Sessegnon, Samaras, Ideye, Anichebe, Berahino.

Burnley

Burnley will run the rule over Kieran Trippier, David Jones and Dean Marney for Sunday's trip to West Brom.

Full-back Trippier has a minor groin complaint while the central midfield pair of Jones (thigh) and Marney (hamstring) have also been struggling with slight problems this week.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

WBA have conceded a league high four goals from outside the box this season.

Burnley have failed to keep a clean sheet in any of their last 19 games against West Brom (all competitions).

The last time Burnley failed to score against WBA was six games ago in November 2006. Mike Duff was playing for the Clarets that day.

This game is the 786th different fixture combination in Premier League history.

WBA have only scored three times this season but have five points to their name.

Burnley and West Brom haven't faced each other since Steven Thompson scored twice for the Clarets in a 3-1 win during a 2009 FA Cup clash

Burnley have gained three points from just one goal in the Premier League this season.

The Clarets have collected only five points from their 21 Premier League away games (W1 D2 L18).

Burnley’s clean sheet at Selhurst Park in their last road trip was the first they have recorded away from home in PL history.

Burnley did not draw any of their first 40 games 0-0 but each of the last three matches have ended goalless.

The only teams to draw 0-0 for four Premier League games in a row are Arsenal (twice) and Tottenham.
