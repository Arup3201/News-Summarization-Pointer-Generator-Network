Cutting-edge car manufacturers strive to defy the laws of physics with streamlined designs.

But this mind-boggling incarnation of the iconic Volkswagen Beetle gives a whole new meaning to the phrase 'gravity-defying'.

This giant sculpture of a bright yellow 1953 Volkswagen by a 50-year-old Indonesian artist has seemingly turned a car into ball.

Gravity-defying: The incredible sculpture shows a commercial product in an innovative way. The artist's specialism is cuboid and spherical art

Topsy turvy: Part of the bumper and number plate are visible at the base of the sculpture (pictured right). The iconic Volkswagen logo can be seen on a wheel that is tucked sandwiched between another wheel and a door (pictured left)

Stunned: Onlookers at Art Basel photograph the sculpture, which has to be seen to be believed

In fact, artist Ichwan Noor used parts of the vehicle as raw materials and combined them with polyester and aluminum to achieve the amazing effect.

The bizarre piece is on display in Hong Kong.

The spherical car is being shown at Art Basel, an exhibition for modern art that moves from Miami to Hong Kong and Switzerland.

The surreal exhibition is not Mr Noor's first time to work with a Beetle. He has previously built a cube-shaped Beetle.
