Tax cut: Prince Charles has benefited from the new 45p tax rate for top earners, despite his income going up

Prince Charles has benefited from the new 45p tax rate for top earners – paying less to the Inland Revenue despite his income going up.

Last year the heir to the throne saw his ‘pay packet’ from the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate which provides funding for the Prince of Wales, rise by £500,000.

But, according to accounts released yesterday, in 2013/2014 he paid £4.1million in tax – a fall of almost £250,000 on his previous bill.

His private secretary, William Nye, said: ‘He has benefited from the 45 per cent tax rate.’ 

Charles has voluntarily paid income tax on his earnings for more than 20 years.

Last year, Charles’s total income and funding, which includes money from taxpayers towards travel on official duties, went up by 7.3 per cent to £21,678,000.

The prince’s official expenditure last year was £12.1million. He also used £2.1million of his income from the Duchy on his personal expenditure – down by £250,000 on the previous year – which covers everything from the cost of his food and wife Camilla’s dresses to supporting his two sons.

The 50p tax rate for high earners, which is claimed to have brought unprecedented levels of tax avoidance with minimal gain, was slashed by George Osborne in his April 2012 budget and brought in last April.

At the time it was said the cut would affect 328,000 top earners with incomes above £150,000 a year. Only yesterday was it confirmed that the future king was one of them.

A Clarence House spokesman told the Mail last night: ‘The prince has voluntarily paid income tax for more than 20 years. He pays whatever rate the Government sets.

‘He then chooses to spend well over half of his income after tax in support of his official and charitable work.’

Unfortunately for Charles, Labour has vowed to re-introduce the 50p top
 rate if it wins the next election. Ed Miliband has repeatedly branded 
the decision to cut the rate from 50p to 45p as a ‘tax cut for 
millionaires’.

While the prince has been lauded for his 
decision pay income tax voluntarily, questions have frequently been 
raised about the amount of expenditure he has been able to write-off as 
taxable expenses on official duties – which amounted to more than 
£10million last year.

The prince and Camilla conducted 665 official engagements and 
entertained 9,493 guests, while staff costs were £6.2m and £326,000 was 
spent on official entertaining and receptions

Yesterday’s accounts, released, 
unusually, on the same day as those of the Queen, also revealed that 
Charles employed 127.6 (including part-time) staff, including 1.3 
butlers and three chauffeurs as well as 2.5 valets and dressers.

He and his family – including Camilla, William, Kate and Harry – received 74,961 and Charles himself wrote 1,959 personally.

The
 prince and Camilla conducted 665 official engagements and entertained 
9,493 guests. Staff costs were £6.2million and £326,000 was spent on 
official entertaining and receptions.

His utility bills dropped by £2,000 to £184,000 for the year.

Charles
 also spent £140,000 on tending his gardens and staff picked more than 
200 kilos of crab apples from his gardens at Highgrove to make 
crab-apple jelly for his shop.

A spokesman denied suggestions that the heir to the throne in any way enjoyed a ‘lavish lifestyle’.

Prince Charles spent more than £1.2million on official travel last year – including £250,000 on hiring a private jet to attend Nelson Mandela’s funeral.

The heir to the throne was by far the biggest royal user of private jets and helicopters, covering 46,000 miles on official duties over the past 12 months.

Although his total travel bill was almost double the previous year’s figures, the rise is somewhat artificial because many of his overseas costs in 2012/13 were covered by the countries where he was travelling.

But yesterday’s royal accounts still laid bare some expensive journeys.

Charles and Camilla’s official tour of India last autumn, after which they travelled to the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Sri Lanka, cost £433,020. Similarly a tour last year to the Middle East, also conducted by private jet, cost £243,180.

‘These trips just could not have been carried out by scheduled flights due to the number of countries visited and the sheer schedule of the engagements that had been packed in,’ an aide said last night. 

Questions are also sure to be asked about flights taken by the Duke of York when the accounts are laid before Parliament.

‘Air Miles Andy’ managed to spend £14,692 on a charter aircraft to take him to Edinburgh and back for official engagements which, happily for the golf fan, included a trip to The Open at Muirhead. 

A surprising addition to the list of high spenders was the Queen’s cousin, the Duke of Gloucester, who racked up £25,575 on scheduled flights to and from Seoul, South Korea, on what is described only as an ‘FCO visit’. 

Overall, travel costs for the Royal Family were down by 7 per cent to £4.2million. The Queen is hoping to reduce costs further by leasing a helicopter for the next 12 months.
