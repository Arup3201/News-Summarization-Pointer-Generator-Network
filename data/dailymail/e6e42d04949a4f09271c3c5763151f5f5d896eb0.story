2012. The year the Earth is meant to end. And the Mayans were right - the Four Horsemen are galloping towards consoles, here to enslave humankind in front of their TVs for eternity.

Darksiders II follows on directly from the brilliant 2010 original, which tells the tale of the Four Horsemen getting into trouble for starting the Apocalypse early. Naughty Horsemen...

Fight to the Death: He may be a Horseman, but Death will be put through his paces

War, who you play in the first game, has been convicted by the Charred Council for the blunder, and is sent back to Earth as punishment.

However, knowing his brother would never do such a thing, Death – the main protagonist in Darksiders II  – flies into a rage, and sets out to clear his sibling’s name.

Defying the council, Death travels to the Nether Realms, a place between Heaven and Hell, to call in some favours from some powerful friends who dwell there.

Starting the demo, we played as Death rode his trusty horse up a snowy peak – battling some ice monsters on the way. What’s immediately evident is how good the game looks.

The art direction, in particular, is superb. That’s no surprise, as the creative director is Joe Madureira, a comic book artist behind the likes of  The Ultimates and X-Men.

Ice to see you: Just one of the beasts you'll face

As Death galloped through the jagged icy valleys, snow glistened from mountains far away, the impressive draw distance pushing along a real sense of scale.

Indeed, for an agent of doom, Death looked remarkably vulnerable and exposed in his surroundings.

The sound is masterful, too. Choirs bellow in the background, creating a haunting ambiance while reinforcing the epic task that Death faces.

Then there’s the combat – which plays like a mix of God of War and Zelda. You’ll hack away with one of the buttons, occasionally adding a more powerful attack with the other.

It’s simple, but hit detection is excellent and Death’s weapons deal some awesome damage.

This is made all the more convincing by Death’s glorious animations. He’ll bob, weave and flip over enemies like an angel of destruction.

We even got to fight a couple of the game’s bosses. Our favourite was the huge ice monster at the end of demo.

Again, gameplay is kept exciting as the beast throws out various kinds of attacks – forcing you to evade and counter.

Wilderness: Death rides his trusty steed through the barren mountains

The action looks great, too – the camera always giving you the best view of the carnage right up until the final, deadly blow.

The end of days can’t come soon enough.
