Rap mogul Suge Knight is facing up to 30 years behind bars after he and comedian Katt Williams were arrested for stealing a female photographer's camera.

The 49-year-old rap mogul is still recovering after getting shot six times two months ago, and on Wednesday he was arrested for allegedly stealing the camera in an incident that left her with 'minor injuries'.

Comedian Katt Williams has also been charged with felony robbery steaming from the alleged scuffle on September 5 in Beverly Hills, California, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office.

The founder of Death Row Records was detained in Las Vegas, Nevada, while 41-year-old Katt was arrested as he arrived at the Inglewood Courthouse in Las Angeles to face charges relating to a separate assault case.

Beverly Hills Police confirmed to the MailOnline that while the arrests have been made, the investigation remains ongoing.

In a statement, the District Attorney's Office said the incident occurred outside a recording studio just days after Suge was shot in late August during Chris Brown's Pre-VMA party at a Hollywood nightclub.

According to the District Attorney's Office: 'The two men are suspected of stealing the camera of an independent celebrity photographer on Sept. 5 outside a studio in Beverly Hills.'

If found guilty, Suge faces significantly more time than Katt due to a previous assault with a deadly weapon conviction, the DA said.

'If convicted, Knight, who has a prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon, faces up to 30 years to life in state prison. Williams faces up to seven years in custody.'

Investigations continue: Beverly Hills police are continuing to look into the alleged incident, which reportedly left the woman with 'minor injuries' 

Both men made bail, with prosecutors asking it to be set at $1 million for the record label founder and $75,000 for the comedian.

Photos of the alleged incident show a woman nursing an injured finger, however, neither Katt nor Suge were pictured at the scene.

Beverly Hills police Sgt. Max Subin told the LA Times that after coming out of the studio the comedian and hip hop mogul came across the photographer and allegedly chased the woman down an alley.

The officer said Kat then grabbed the woman's camera 'forcibly' and she 'sustained minor injuries'.

When police arrived on the scene, both of the stars had left, he said. Neither man has been charged with assault. 

Both Suge - whose real name is Marion - and Katt - real name Micah - have had their fair share of run-ins with police.

When he was arrested on Wednesday, Katt was to face court over a July 15 incident in Inglewood when he allegedly pepper-sprayed a man and tried to hit him with his car.

The comedian was charged with two counts of felony assault in addition to the use of tear gas.

That same month, Los Angeles County sheriffs were called to the Comedy Store in West Hollywood after reports he pulled out a gun and smashed a car window. No charges were laid over that incident.

Suge's rap sheet is a little longer, with the 49-year-old first arrested in 1992 on assault and weapons charges for which he received probation.

However in 1996, he was arrested after security cameras at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas caught him and a group of other men beating a gang member. He was sentenced to nine years in prison for parole violation. 

He was imprisoned twice more for violating his parole after being caught consorting with gang members and then assaulting a valet in 2003.

Suge has also been the victim of a number of serious crimes - and has been shot three times.

Besides getting shot in August, Suge was also injured in 2005, when he was shot in Miami during another pre-awards party.

Most famously he was hit by bullet fragments in 1996 in Las Vegas when he was sitting next to rapper Tupac Shakur during a drive-by hit on their car. Tupac did not survive.

Tough year: On August 24, the rap mogul was shot six times inside Chris Brown's pre-VMA party at a Hollywood nightclub. It was the third time he had been injured in a shooting
