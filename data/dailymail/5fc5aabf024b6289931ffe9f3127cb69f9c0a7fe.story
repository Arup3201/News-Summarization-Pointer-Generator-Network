If Graeme McDowell is to be believed, Victor Dubuisson will be a household name in the near future — yet what is publicly known about the Frenchman wouldn’t fill the back of a score card.

‘Enigmatic’ doesn’t come close to describing the 24-year-old, who is originally from Cannes but is such a man of mystery that nobody apart from himself knows for sure where he now resides. Reportedly, over the past year, he has based himself in Honduras (to avoid punitive French taxes), Andorra, Monte Carlo and elsewhere.

The European Tour says he is a resident on Antibes in south-east France. The man himself will not say. Nor will he speak of his background, especially a childhood in which he was left ‘by myself’ and left school aged ‘10 or 12’ to concentrate on golf.

Graeme McDowell thinks Victor Dubuisson will be a household name in golf in the very near future

Friend and compatriot Thomas Levet has said: ‘I know his family story and it was not an easy childhood, let’s leave it at that.’ Dubuisson says his childhood is too painful to talk about.

One thing is certain: the Ryder Cup rookie is some player, underlined by the skills he displayed in two wins from the two fourballs matches he has played alongside McDowell here.

On this form he has an excellent chance of adding another in the singles. His and McDowell’s latest victims on Saturday were Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker, drubbed 5&4.

Dubuisson’s father was reportedly a banker. One of France’s most famous basketball players, Herve Dubuisson, is supposedly his uncle. Beyond that, not much is known.

After Dubuisson became a YouTube star thanks to wondershots in the desert in an Arizona match play tournament earlier this year, he changed his phone number to avoid unwanted calls.

The Frenchman’s first Tour victory was in the Turkish Airlines Open last year and he has been talked up ever since.

McDowell has said in the past few days: ‘This kid is the next superstar in Europe.’ On Saturday, he added: ‘It’s been such a pleasure to play with him. He might be the best kid I’ve played with since Rory McIlroy, and that says a lot.’

Saturday’s highlights included a bloodless putt for a half at the first, a beautiful approach to the third, a tee shot to within five feet on the sixth, the same again on the 10th and delightful play to set up the winning hole.

The late Seve Ballesteros’s son Javier tweeted earlier this year: ‘Victor Dubuisson is my new hero.’

Lee Westwood says he is a friendly guy but ‘it is very difficult to know what to make of Victor’.

McDowell says he is a ‘great guy’, while US captain Tom Watson said: ‘The man is a sensation.’

Dubuisson himself simply says: ‘I am a simple man.’ Good at golf, too.
