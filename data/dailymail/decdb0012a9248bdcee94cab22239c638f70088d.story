Newcastle United have made Jack Colback their second signing of the summer after they snapped up the midfielder from North East rivals Sunderland on a free transfer.

The 24-year-old, a boyhood Newcastle fan, makes the short switch from the Stadium of Light to St James' Park and was spotted being given a tour by the club's media team.

It means Alan Pardew got the better of Paul Lambert's Aston Villa and Sam Allardyce's West Ham - two sides that had Colback on their wish-list.

Colback, who grew up in North Tyneside, is expected to be given a five-year contract with the Toon Army.

Colback made 115 appearances in the league for Sunderland since rising through the youth ranks, scoring four goals. During that time, he had two spells on loan at Ipswich Town.

On Friday, Newcastle made their first 
signing of the summer in striker Ayoze Perez from Tenerife, ending a 501-day transfer drought.

The 
20-year-old cost the Magpies £1.5m and had scored 16 goals in 34 
appearances in Segunda Division last year.

Colback said: 'I'm absolutely delighted. To come to the team I supported as a boy, my hometown team, will be really special for me.

'It was an opportunity I couldn't let slip. If you asked fans around the world the one thing they'd like to do before they die, it would be to play for the team they support and I've got the chance to do that.

'I've only got good things to say about Sunderland, they gave me my chance and I want to thank the fans and the club for all their support. I hope they can understand the chance I've had here to move to my boyhood club.  Now I can't wait to pull on the black and white shirt at St. James' Park for the first time.'

Magpies boss Pardew added: 'I'm extremely pleased to have brought Jack to Newcastle United.

'He's a great passer, versatile and rarely gives the ball away. He's also a local lad and knows exactly what playing for this club means.

'And at 24 years old, his best years are ahead of him so I think he'll be a big asset to us.'
