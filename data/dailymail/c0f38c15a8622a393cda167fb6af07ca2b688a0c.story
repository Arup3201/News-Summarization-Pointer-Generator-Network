A handicapped pensioner was killed and five others were seriously injured when a military jet crashed into a residential care home in France last night.

The horrific accident took place in the town of Vouvray, near Tours, when the Alpha trainer hit the Bellangerie home, one of the biggest in the area, soon after 5.30pm.

'Two pilots ejected and parachuted to safety after flying into a dark area which appeared to be uninhabited,' said airforce commander Cyril Duvivier.

He said both men - one of whom was a student - were uninjured and had been taken to hospital for routine checks.

But the impact had caused the death of the 63-year-old woman, who has not yet been named, and seriously injured the others, who are also unidentified.

Pictures showed a building in the Bellangerie complex completely smashed to pieces, with debris lying everywhere.

Health Minister Marisol Touraine travelled to the scene from Paris and called for a 'transparent enquiry' to be opened immediately.

More than 75 people people live at the home, with the buildings which were hit mainly housing women.

The plane had set off from France's airfoce base 705, near Parcay-Melay, in the Loire Valley.

Colonel Duvivier told AFP news agency that the plane had been on a night training flight with an instructor and trainee pilot on board.

He said the Alpha Jet was usually a 'very reliable' one, which has been in service for around 30 years.

'It belongs to a generation of straightforward planes, which have proved themselves,' said the Colonel.

It was the first accident involving aircraft from the 705 base for at least 30 years.
