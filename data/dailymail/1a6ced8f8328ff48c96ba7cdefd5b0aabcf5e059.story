Harriet, 28, and Marti, 40, had been in an on-again off-again relationship for three years and were living apart when they discovered they were expecting their first daughter Katie

The ABC's Crash Test Mummies & Daddies follows five couples over the first four months of their newborn's life to capture the stress, strain and joy a baby can bring.

Harriet and Marti were faced with the dramas every new parents experiences, but they had an added struggle when their daughter Katie was diagnosed with a serious thyroid problem shortly after birth.

'The biggest struggle was finding our feet as a family and trying to get our relationship back together in the midst of having a sick baby,' Harriet told Daily Mail Australia.

Harriet said the biggest struggle when Katie was born was trying to get their relationship back on track while finding their feet as a new family

'I certainly felt like a complete and utter failure as a mum.

'I think (Katie's diagnosis) made a difficult situation a little bit harder for us... but you have to take the good with the bad.'

Katie initially struggled with sleeping at night and will now be on medication for the rest of her life as a result of her thyroid condition.

'Getting the call was a tremendous shock and gave us an incredible fright,' Marti said.

'But at our first doctor’s appointment he reassured us somewhat that it’s going to manageable. In a way we feel very lucky with Katie’s condition; it could have been a lot worse.'

The couple said while they thought having the television cameras around would be intrusive and stressful, it actually did wonders for their strained relationship.

'For many people young couples, it can put a lot of strain on their relationship. For us this has just solidified our relationship. It hasn’t strained our relationship,' Marti said.

'It was terrifying. I actually genuinely believed I was going to be a single mother. Going through the pregnancy alone was frightening… But I’ve come with the utmost respect for people who do it alone,' Harriet added.

'Having Katie has taught us to communicate with each other. She taught us why we liked each other in the first place.

'I think having the cameras around helped us. We weren’t fighting when they were there. We had a lot of fun when they were there and they forced us to enjoy it in a way.'

After a stressful first few months, the couple say the biggest piece of advice they can give any new parent would be to 'not listen to any advice'.

'Do what works – there’s no right or wrong answer. We had a very difficult baby for the first few months so we had to do what worked for us,' Harriet said.

'You should also accept all offers of help and say thank you.'

Cathrine Fowler, a professor from the Tresillian Chair in Child & Family Health, agreed that accepting people's help was beneficial.

'It’s a really important thing because we all say it, but parents often have trouble accepting the help,' Prof Fowler said.

'Write out a list of the things that need to be done, so when someone asks what I can do, there's a list of the fridge. It's really helpful for the partners who can often feel like they can never do anything right.'

Harriet and Marti said a list would have been ideal for when Katie was first born.

'I definitely had a feeling of helplessness at the start. I've only been responsible for myself and now I've got this baby and a family. There's very little as a father that you can do. I can't (breast) feed... there's a lot of things going on and you feel a bit helpless,' Marti said.

Crash Test Mummies & Daddies starts on Wednesday, September 10 at 9.30pm on ABC2.
