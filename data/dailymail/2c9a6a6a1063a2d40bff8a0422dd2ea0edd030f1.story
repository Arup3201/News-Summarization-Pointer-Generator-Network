It took weeks to create and more than 21,000 separate images had to be stitched together to make this incredible 360 degree interactive picture of Sydney. 

The painstaking work, which was even helped along by robots, which saw three cameras taking pictures from Westfield Centre Point Tower in the CBD has more than paid off. 

This is the largest image ever panoramic 125 gigapixel photo taken in Australia.

This fascinating 360 degree image of Sydney was taken by John Colebrook, product director, at Pixelcase after being asked by CommBank to help them with their new campaign 

The incredible pictures show off Sydney's natural beauty on a clear day with the sun shining

Mr Colebrook and his team had to take over 21,000 images over several weeks to create the 360 degree image

CommBank asked Pixelcase, a media agency specialising in the ground breaking use of digital photography, to help capture the country's largest ever panoramic photo, for interactive game ‘Where’s My Wallet’. 

The game gives people the chance to find 10 wallets each day and claim their $200 prize using the new service called Cardless Cash service available on the app.

John Colebrook, product director at Pixelcase who created the image, explained CommBank wanted to give Australians a fun way to experience a new service. 

He said: 'This is the largest gigapixel image that we have ever worked on, there is quite a lot of specialised equipment involved. 

Mr Colebrook said: 'This is the largest gigapixel image that we have ever worked on' 

Specialised equipment and a robot was used to help create the amazing image over several weeks 

Mr Coleman (above) said: 'CommBank asked us to create the image to launch ‘Where’s My Wallet’, which is an interactive online game that allows Aussies to search the city of Sydney for virtual lost wallets worth $200' 

'It involves taking pictures incrementally using a high resolution camera and a robot that will move the camera. 

'The camera was set up in three different locations throughout the tower and together they captured an arc of 180 degrees each and then they are merged together to create that 360 degree view online.' 

Cardless Cash is the CommBank app's newest feature which gives customers with an eligible account to withdraw funds from CommBank ATMs without a card.

The image,  which allows users to see as far as the Blue Mountains, has a radius of 100km

The feature, which is an Australian first, allows the customer to make one cardless ATM withdrawal per day with a maximum limit of $200.

Users can collect the cash themselves from the majority of our CommBank ATMs across the country. 

Once the user has set up the withdrawal in the app, they will receive two codes, an eight digit cash code and a four digit cash PIN. 

Jessica Myers (above) from CommBank, says the image is 'pushing boundaries' for the bank 

Jessica Myers, executive marketing manager for CommBank, said: 'Where's my Wallet' is an online virtual treasure hunt and what we have done is taken a 360 degree panoramic image of the entire of Sydney. 

'This image itself is so detailed that you can zoom in really close and find wallets that we have hidden across Sydney. 

'For us it's really great to have taken the largest image ever in Australia. 

'It really pushes the boundaries in terms of technology which is a real big focus for the bank and also what is better than a really detailed image of Sydney harbour on a sunny day for people to zoom around and view.' 

Angus Sullivan, executive general manager for cards, payments, analytics and retail strategy, at Commonwealth Bank, added: 'Losing your wallet is inconvenient and can leave you stranded without cash, so for the next two weeks we’re giving all Australians the chance to find a wallet worth $200 in our record-breaking 125 gigapixel image.' 

The Where's My Wallet competition runs for two weeks and starts at 6am each morning.
