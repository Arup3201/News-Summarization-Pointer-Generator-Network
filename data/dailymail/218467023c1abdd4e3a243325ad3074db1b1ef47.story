So-called 'football wonderkids' are bandied about almost daily, but if Roma's nine-year-old Pietro Tomaselli doesn't make it there is something wrong in the world.

The pint-sized playmaker showed off some of his skills during a training session with the Serie A club, which featured a few moves that appeared to defy the laws of gravity.

Aside from the usual jinks, stepovers and nutmegs the youngster also manged to chip a goalkeeper at least twice his height and score with what can only be described as a double backheel.

Roma signed the youngster amid interest from a host of European clubs

The young Belgian, who has obviously been labelled as 'the next Totti', was signed by the Giallorossi after they watched a series of Youtube clips showing him run rings around opponents at Anderlecht's youth academy.

Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United and Manchester City were also reportedly interested in the talented starlet but his family chose Roma partly because of their Italian heritage.

'We were really wonderfully welcomed,' Tomaselli's father Pino said.

'Everyone knows about him already: the club president, the senior players. They think he could be better than Diego Maradona,' he added.
