A Spanish court is to hear a paternity suit brought against ex-King Juan Carlos by a 48-year-old Belgian woman who claims to be his daughter.

Ingrid Sartiau maintains her mother had a relationship with Juan Carlos that lasted into 1966, the year she was born. 

Juan Carlos and former Queen Sofia were married in 1962.

The 78-year-old could be ordered to take a paternity test if there is sufficient evidence to back the woman's case, a court spokesman said.

It is a further embarrassing episode for the father of King Felipe VI who abdicated last year in a move aimed at restoring the Spanish monarchy's popularity.

A string of scandals had identified the royals as woefully out of touch, including a secret, luxury elephant-hunting trip by Juan Carlos in Africa at the height of Spain's economic crisis.

The abdication of the 78-year-old former king, who has had health problems and walks with a cane after multiple hip operations, also led to the loss of his judicial immunity.   

A palace spokesman declined comment on the case yesterday.

The court rejected another paternity case brought against the former king by a 58-year-old Spanish man, Albert Sola, saying it did not meet legal requirements. 

Sola has claimed for years that his birth mother, the daughter of a well-known Barcelona banker, may have had an affair with Juan Carlos before he married Queen Sofia.

He and Sartiau made headlines in Spain in 2012 when they teamed up and underwent DNA tests that they said showed there was a 91 percent chance that they had one parent in common. 

Spanish lawmakers rushed through legislation after his abdication to prevent Juan Carlos being tried in ordinary courts. 

However, he can still be tried in the highest Spanish court, the Supreme Court.

Although King Felipe consistently scores highly in opinion polls, his family continues to draw unwelcome headlines. 

His sister, Cristina de Borbon, is due to stand trial on tax fraud charges in the second half of this year. 

She will be the first member of the royal family to stand trial since the monarchy was restored in 1975.

Juan Carlos was for decades held in high esteem for steering Spain from military dictatorship to democracy. 

He took over the throne in 1975, two days after the death of longtime dictator Gen. Francisco Franco.

But his reputation plummeted after he took a secret elephant hunting trip to Botswana in 2012 at the height of Spain's financial crisis. He later apologized for the trip.
