Wily: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne

The only thing we have to fear is fear itself’ was the famous exhortation delivered to the American people by Franklin D. Roosevelt when he became US President in 1933. His opponent in the preceding election, the hapless Herbert Hoover, had spent much of the campaign insisting that the only real problem with the economy was a lack of confidence.

Of course, FDR’s catchphrase and Hoover’s analysis actually amounted to saying the same thing in different ways. But Roosevelt went on to become the longest-serving President yet and Hoover is regarded as one of the great failures of US politics.

George Osborne seems to have learnt directly from the Roosevelt playbook. Every word of his Autumn Statement was laced with tactical electoral calculations and a determination to limit Labour’s room for manoeuvre to virtually zero. In many areas, the Chancellor has stolen the Opposition’s clothes and is daring them to criticise him for putting them on.

An objective assessment of the Coalition’s strategy would point to the stark failure to reduce the vast budget deficit. This now appears to be stuck, for the time being at about £90 billion – meaning that the Government is overspending by around £1,500 for every man, woman and child in Britain, every year. The Government’s declared intention was to eliminate this deficit by the time of the next General Election. Osborne has missed that target by several country miles. Tax receipts have been lower than expected. And despite all the sound and fury about ‘the age of austerity’, overall government spending is down by only a fraction in real terms.

IN normal circumstances, you might think that the governing party would expect to be hounded from office in the upcoming Election. Osborne is having none of such talk. Instead, he is displaying the hide of a rhino and the cunning of a fox.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls will point across the Dispatch Box and rage about how the deficit is far greater than the Tories promised. But the unspoken truth is that the Coalition have long since abandoned their plan to get spending under control. Instead, they have basically adopted the much slower, much less ambitious target proposed by the Labour Party at the last Election – to close off the deficit in about ten years rather than in only five. Sure, the deficit is much higher than Osborne initially planned – but isn’t this just what the Opposition wanted?

They insisted that the more responsible plan was to get the deficit to come down gradually, not rapidly. That is exactly what is happening. So what are the Labour Party complaining about exactly?

I am not so cynical as to suggest that the Chancellor has deliberately failed to eliminate the Government’s overspend on target. But he appears to have concluded that such a failure may actually give him an extra ace up his sleeve.

If state expenditure were more tightly under control, voters might accept that the Conservatives’ work had been completed and they could now afford to put in place a Labour-led government to go on a spending spree. But Osborne’s plea is that his task is only half-done and you simply can’t trust Labour to complete it. This is why the Tory mantra of the need for a ‘long-term economic plan’ is the centrepiece of their campaign.

Machiavelli set out his theories in 1513's The Prince

Changes in stamp duty were the most dramatic tax change unveiled by the Chancellor last week. But even here the motivation seems to be to set a clever political trap for his opponents.

Ending the absurd cliff-edge effects of the previous system was a very good move in principle. But the devil was in the detail. The political thinking of Osborne was most definitely in the detail too. Properties worth more than £2 million will see a dramatic rise in stamp duty. This is likely to mean that large London properties become harder to sell or fall in value. It also makes imposing a mansion tax on top of this is now even harder to justify.

In essence, Osborne has introduced a ‘mansion purchase tax’. For Labour to demand a further tax on top of this for owning a so-called mansion, in addition to buying one, now looks even more like the narrow-minded politics of envy.

The Government is still raising and spending far too much money. Our absurdly complex tax rulebook gets even longer and more complicated every time the Chancellor makes a statement. Those of us who want dramatic economic reform will feel the Coalition has been rather unambitious.

But observers of raw electoral tactics might consider Osborne something of a genius. Indeed, had the master of the dark political arts, Machiavelli, been present last Wednesday, it is likely that he would have been the first to rise to his feet and applaud.
