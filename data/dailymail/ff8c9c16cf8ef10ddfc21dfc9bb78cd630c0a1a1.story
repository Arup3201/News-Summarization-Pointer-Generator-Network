An aeroplane might not be the first place you think of when looking for a good night's rest but this jumbo jet-turned-hostel is an aircraft that you can finally sleep on.

Located just outside of Stockholm-Arlanda Airport, Sweden, this former Boeing 457 has swapped engines for bedrooms to offer visitors a unique overnight stay they will never forget.

The brainchild of barmy businessman, Oscar Dios, the entrepreneur spent over £1.5million (€2million) over six months to transform the huge plane into the aptly named Jumbo Stay Hotel.

This retired Boeing 457 in Stockholm, Sweden has been transformed into a unique hostel aptly named the Jumbo Stay Hotel

The cockpit has been swapped for a bedroom at the unusual hostel, located just outside of Stockholm-Arlanda Airport

The entire transformation, including the re-modelled airplane bar, cost approximately £1.5million (€2million)

After stripping the plane of its 450 chairs, the former Pan-Am aircraft now boasts 33 different rooms as well as a luxury suite for those who want to make their stay even more memorable.

For around £320 (€400) guests can take in the stunning, panoramic views of the runway from the cosy converted cockpit as well as enjoy the privacy of their own en-suite bathroom.

But that isn't all, visitors can also kick back in the communal lounge in restored arm chairs or sip from martini glasses in the comfortable on board bar.

Oscar said: 'I wanted to open up a hotel on the airport.

'I learnt about the decommissioned aircraft and I thought it would an interesting way of getting into the airport hotel market.

'The Jumbo Stay Hotel is right on the airport, it's located 20 metres outside, "airside", next to the taxi runway for the planes.

'Our guests are simply amazed when they see our hotel. 

The hotel is located just 65ft from the airport, next to the taxi runway that planes currently use

Owner and investor Oscar Dios says that guests are often amazed when they set foot in the hotel

Second life: The plane was once part of the Pan-Am fleet and flew all over the world between 1984 and 1991

Though the plane has served its time in the skies, owner Oscar Dios says it's now 'resting and guarding' its new guests

'I would say the best part of the hotel is the view from the cockpits window.

'The plane was once part of the Pan-Am airline fleet and flew between 1984 and 1991.

'This piece of aircraft has flown day and night for so many years.

'Now it is finally resting and guarding our new guests, calm and stable on the ground.'
