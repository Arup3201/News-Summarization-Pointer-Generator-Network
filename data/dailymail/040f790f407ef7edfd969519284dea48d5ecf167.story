A Christian family was stunned to discover their teenage daughter was told to take off her 'virginity rocks' t-shirt - because it could lead to awkward conversations about sex.

Chloe Rubiano, an eighth-grade student at Fayetteville, Arkansas, was told to replace the item with a standard-issue gym shirt because it 'opens up too many doors for conversations'.

Miss Rubiano had bought the t-shirt at a Christian festival, and wanted to wear it to school because it represented her beliefs, but was told by the vice-principal of Ramay Junior High that it could be a classroom distraction.

Beliefs: Miss Rubiano, who got her shirt at a Christian festival, said that the shirt represents her beliefs, and she was surprised that anybody should take issue with it

Her mother, Bambi Crozier, said she was surprised by the school's decision to ban the shirt, which says on the reverse 'I'm loving my husband and I haven't even married him'.

She told 5News: 'This is part of sex ed to me. Virginity is where you need to be - it represents what she believes.'

Miss Rubiano added: 'I just really like the shirt because I was always raised that way. I didn’t really think anyone would make a big deal out of it.'

The family has said that they thought the shirt was appropriate wear for school, even though the message is bold.

But they also said they can understand the school's point of view and that it is important for Miss Rubiano to do what the staff at school tell her.

Fayetteville school authorities clarified that any potentially disruptive clothing is banned.
