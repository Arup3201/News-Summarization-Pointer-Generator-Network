One in four office workers keep an eye on their emails as they eat, according to a new study by O2

Half of office workers now eat lunch at their desks and one in four keep an eye on their emails as they eat, according to a new study.

Researchers also found office workers spend an average of just 15 minutes eating their lunch with 15.8million workers failing to take a full lunch hour.

The poll, by O2 Priority to launch its £1 Lunch, found the most commonly stated excuse for workers failing to take a proper lunch break was being ‘too busy’ - with one in six people even feeling guilty about leaving their desk.

It also found that time pressures are not the only thing stopping people from enjoying a lunch break.

More than a third said the cost of food was the biggest factor affecting their decision of what to buy for lunch and more than one in four workers opt to take a packed lunch to work to save cash, according to the research.

In what is perhaps a reflection of ever-busier lives, the lunch break is increasingly used as admin time for workers’ personal lives.

The most common admin tasks performed by workers during their lunch break are internet banking (40 per cent), personal phone calls (39 per cent), booking appointments (29 per cent), shopping online (28 per cent) and paying bills (21 per cent).

Food psychologist Doctor Christy Fergusson said workers who eat at their desks could be in danger of overeating.

She said:  ‘It’s clear that most of us are eating too fast, and all-too-often we’re distracted by other tasks while eating so we don’t take time to notice and appreciate our food.

‘There’s a danger that this could lead to overeating - but it also means that our mind is constantly working so we don’t ever switch off to focus on the food itself.

‘A lunch break is a time to re-fuel, but it should also give us some breathing space from work.’
