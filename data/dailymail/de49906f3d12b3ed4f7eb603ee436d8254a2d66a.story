West Ham have pulled out of a loan deal for 19-year-old AC Milan striker M'Baye Niang.

The striker was chased by Everton, Tottenham and Arsenal 18 months ago while at Caen.

The France Under 21 international became the San Siro club’s second youngest scorer in history, but a dip in form and Milan’s disastrous season saw him shipped off to Montpellier on loan in January.
