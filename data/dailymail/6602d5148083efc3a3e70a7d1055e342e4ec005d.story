The morning after Ed Miliband’s conference speech, David Cameron and his speechwriting team gathered at Chequers. The Prime Minister was in bullish mood. Unlike several of his Cabinet colleagues, he wasn’t overly concerned by Miliband’s raid on ‘One Nation’ Tory territory.

He joked: ‘It’s impressive to give a speech for 70 minutes without notes; it’s even more impressive to give a speech for 70 minutes without notes and not say anything.’

Cameron’s crack is typical of his new attitude. The Prime Minister has finally heeded the pleas of many of his closest allies and made himself and his Downing Street operation more political.

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps and London Mayor Boris Johnson

New Tory Chairman Grant Shapps, unlike his predecessor Baroness Warsi, attends the two key No 10 meetings of the day at 8.30am and 4pm. This ensures the party-political perspective is heard before decisions are taken.

This more political approach will be evident in Cameron’s conference speech on Wednesday. He’ll argue his opponents don’t understand how to make Britain economically competitive. He’ll also try to show voters who want to get on that he understands that aspiration is the spur to success.

Cameron’s party is increasingly focused on a strategy for winning a majority in 2015. The initial findings were presented to Tory Cabinet Ministers last month and to key aides at the party’s campaign headquarters last week.

Outright victory has been made far harder by the Liberal Democrats’ refusal to back Tory efforts to reduce pro-Labour bias in the electoral system. But those working on the strategy – the Prime Minister’s political secretary Stephen Gilbert, his director of strategy Andrew Cooper and Shapps – believe that there are reasons for optimism.

First, they think the Nineties phenomenon of ‘shy Tories’ – people not being prepared to say they are voting for the party – has returned. They calculate that the party’s true level of support could be five points or more above what headline figures suggest.

Second, they are confident that incumbency gives them an advantage. Their analysis of the last Election result shows sitting MPs tended to be insulated against the national swing.

Third, they think they can be more targeted. In 2010, the Tories were trying to take 160 seats. This time, they are looking at just 40. I’m told the list will include more than ten Lib Dem seats.

The economy remains the key to victory in 2015, however. In his speech tomorrow, George Osborne will set out tax breaks designed to boost growth.

However, on Europe little will be said. One insider ascribes this to the influence of Cabinet Secretary Jeremy Heywood. ‘You can’t talk about Europe in No 10 without Jeremy jumping down your throat,’ I’m told.  

Cameron will have to say more soon. For his party wants two things from him: an understanding of how he intends to win next time and a clear lead on Europe. Providing these will be the best way to unite Tories around him.

Wordsmith: Speechwriter Clare Foges

David Cameron’s conference speech is the first big challenge for his new chief speechwriter, Clare Foges.

Foges, who took on the job last 
month following the move of  her predecessor Julian Glover  to the 
Department for Transport, drafted the speech pretty  much 
single-handedly. 

Foges, who is in her early 30s, has
 risen quickly though the Tory ranks. She previously worked for MP  John
 Hayes and Boris Johnson. At the start of her career, she supplemented 
her salary by driving an ice-cream van. 

She’s been writing for Cameron 
since 2008. After the Election, she followed him into No 10, where she 
is respected for her ability to capture the Prime Minister’s voice, 
knowing how he  would choose to say something.

Boris Johnson might be going to Tory conference for only 24 hours but, to the concern of many in Downing Street, he’s still set to be the centre of attention.

One No 10 aide says, only  half-jokingly: ‘At least we know where the trouble will come from.’

There’s also anger at one of Boris’s people claiming he turned down five invitations to Chequers before accepting one last weekend.

Cameron is, strikingly, doing a series of TV interviews on Tuesday, both the day of the London Mayor’s speech and the Prime Minister’s birthday. I suspect the present he really wants is for Boris to behave.

Ed Miliband and his team  are planning a ¿One Nation¿ trip across Britain designed to ram home the  message of his conference address

First there was the speech, then there was the tour. Ed Miliband and his team are planning a ‘One Nation’ trip across Britain designed to ram home the  message of his conference address.

I understand the Labour leader is keen to show he is prepared to go to places where his party has long been absent, to show he’s serious in his intent to represent the whole country. One stop will be in a solidly Tory seat hit by rapidly rising rail fares.

Miliband also wants to visit a constituency particularly affected by immigration. He knows that the last Labour Government’s failure on this issue has hurt the party badly.

I’m informed that he wants to set out  a comprehensive new policy, including restrictions on low-skilled migration from within the European Union.

This would pose a particular challenge to the Tories  as EU workers are not included in the Government’s immigration cap.

Another part of the ‘One Nation’ message  is the fight for the union. Those close to  the Labour leader are urging him to take the battle to the Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond’s backyard and head to Aberdeenshire to make his case that Scotland should remain part of the United Kingdom.

Yet Miliband needs more policy to accompany his new rhetoric. I understand there will be a Shadow Cabinet away-day later this month to thrash out proposals. 

He is still a long way from persuading the public that Labour would handle the nation’s finances competently. But the success of this conference has given him a political opening. Prime Minister Miliband is now a possibility that needs to be taken seriously.
