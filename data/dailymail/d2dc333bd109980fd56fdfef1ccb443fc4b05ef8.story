A wild shooting incident in Miami that saw 23 officers fire off 377 rounds killing two unarmed men is being investigated by the State Attorney's Office and the Miami Dade Police department.

Adrian Montesano, 27, and Corsini Valdes, 50, died inside a car in a hail of bullets unleashed by South Florida cops early one morning last December.

Montesano had earlier robbed a Walgreens at gunpoint and following that shot police officer Saul Rodriguez in a nearby trailer park.

Deadly chase: Adrian Montesano, 27, died after 23 police opened fire on his vehicle

Bullet-riddled: The blue Volvo was trapped between a tree and a pole, and its occupants unarmed

CBS
 reports that by 5am, every police officer in South Florida was looking 
for Adrian Montesano, who had stolen the officer's patrol vehicle, 
driven it to his grandmother's house and fled in her blue Volvo.

The Volvo crashed in the backyard of a townhouse on 65th Street just off 27th Avenue, wedged between a light pole and a tree.

By this point, CBS reports, neither Montesano nor Valdes was armed.

Witnesses say less than a minute passed before officers opened fire, sending more than 50 bullets into the vehicle.

'And the guy tried to put his hands up. And as soon as he put his hands up, it erupted again. And that was it for them. That guy tried his best to give up.'

During the second volley of shots, both Montsano and Valdes, who was innocent of any crime, died as bullets tore through their bodies.

Montesano and Valdes weren't the only ones struck by the huge volume of bullets.

Two officers were hit in the crossfire, one officer shot in the arm, and the other hit in the arm and grazed on the head, an injury that could have proved fatal had it been half an inch to the right.

Two others sustained ruptured eardrums from the deafening blasts.

Residents were fortunate not to have hit shot in the unrestrained shooting.

'It
 was like the Wild Wild West, man, crazy,' Vandiver, who barely made it 
through the back door of his home before the gunfire erupted, told CBS.

Endangered: Witnesses say the officers fired wildly, with no concern for nearby residents

Damage: Townhouses, businesses, cars and fences were damaged by the gunfire

'Shooting
 just wild; shooting all over the place. Bullets could have come through
 the window. Anything could have happened man. They weren’t thinking, 
they weren’t thinking at all.'

CBS
 reports that the indiscriminate shooting indicates that officers lost 
sight of their own training and failed to listen to their radios or 
coordinate their actions, which endangered the public as well as 
themselves.

Holes were blasted into a townhouse where a 12-year-old dove for over and a four-month-old baby slept in a crib.

Another neighbor said officers were laughing as they pulled the bullet-riddled bodies of Montesano and Valdes from the Volvo.

'The policemen that had on the black and white vests were out there laughing like it was so funny,' the neighbor told CBS.

'Because they got a free shot off them people. Shooting all them bullets like that, that don’t make no sense.'

The mayhem began at 3.30am Tuesday when Adrian Montesano tried to rob a
 Walgreens in Little Havana and the crime went horribly wrong. Police 
say he took a hostage in an attempt to get what he wanted.

Innocent victim: It's unclear how Corsini Valdes came to be in the vehicle with Montesano

Police
 released a surveillance camera image showing 27-year-old Montesano with
 his arm around a female hostage's throat while he points a 
semiautomatic pistol at her head. She was later released unharmed.

Witnesses said Montesano was driving 
pickup truck for his heating and air conditioning business that was 
emblazoned with his own name. 

A man who arrived at the crime scene and identified himself as Montesano's friend told the Miami Herald that Montesano robbed the pharmacy to support his drug addiction.

He said that Montesano had been an upstanding citizen before he 'fell in with the wrong crowd.'

About 5am, Miami Officer Saul Rodriguez spotted Montesano's truck at a trailer park about two miles from the robbery scene.

When the 13-year police veteran approached the vehicle, Montesano shot him in the stomach.

The fugitive then took the officer's pistol and sped off in his squad car.

WSNV-TV reports that Rodriguez could be heard gasping for breath as he radioed in a description of the man who shot him.

'White male. Red shirt. Gray pants. Officer down.'

That
 set off a frantic manhunt across the city. Half an hour later, the 
squad car was spotted near  the home of a family member of Montesano.

Officers spotted him in his grandmother's blue Volvo, which witnesses later said he had taken from her home.

A
 police pursuit ensued and Montesano, who was driving with Corsini 
Valdes, crashed. It's not clear how or why Valdes was in the car.

Witnesses say Montesano used his company pickup truck - which has his own name plastered all over it - as a getaway vehicle after the robbery

Initial reports stated that the pair opened fire, but CBS later revealed that neither was armed.

Police fired on the Volvo and riddled the car with bullets.

One of the men died at the scene. The other was mortally wounded and died at the hospital shortly after the gun battle.

Three
 other officers were hospitalized with minor injuries from the gunfight,
 including an officer who was hit by flying glass.

All officers, including Officer Rodriguez, made full recoveries from their injuries.

Montesano had only one previous run-in with police, when he was arrested in 2007 for trespassing after he drove through a fence into a beach, the Herald reports.

Officers found him trying to use beach signs to get his truck unstuck from the sand. When police approached him, he swore at them and claimed he a member of his family was a police officer.

The mayhem snarled traffic across the city throughout the morning commute as detectives worked to examine the multiple crime scenes and collect evidence.
