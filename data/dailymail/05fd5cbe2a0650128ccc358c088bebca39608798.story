A pair of conjoined twins born sharing a tailbone and genitals will have to undergo a lengthy operation to be separated.

The twin sisters were born on 17 March at Ningdu Hospital in Jiangxi, China.

They were delivered via caesarean section after their mother's blood pressure dramatically increased, the People's Daily Online reported.

The girls' father, whose surname is Zeng, 35, said his daughters were transferred to a Shanghai hospital yesterday after doctors advised him they desperately needed separation surgery.

The twins are the man's first children with his wife, to whom he has been married for eight years.

A hospital report stated: 'The twins are joined by their sacrococcygeal regions and their genitals. One back passage is blocked and the other is normal.'

It added that the twins might die if they are not given separation surgery within four days. The operation could take up to 12 hours.

And at the end of February two ten-month-old conjoined baby girls from Texas survived a world-first operation to separate them.

Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata shared the same chest wall, lungs, pericardial sac, diaphragm, liver, intestines, colon and pelvis.

A team of more than 26 clinicians, including 12 surgeons, six anesthesiologists and eight surgical nurses at the Texas Children's Hospital operated to separate the girls.

The 26-hour surgery was the first time twins conjoined at the chest and abdomen in this way had been successfully separated.
