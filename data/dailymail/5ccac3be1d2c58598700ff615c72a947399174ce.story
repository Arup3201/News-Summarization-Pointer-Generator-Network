A Tampa woman is suing Wells Fargo after she was fired from the bank for bringing her gun to work.

Ivette Ros, 37, has a concealed weapons permit and carries a nine millimeter handgun.

The single mother of three says she was fired from her job as a bank manager at the Oldsmar branch last year when bank officials were made aware of the deadly weapon she was concealing.

Armed: Ivette Ros regularly carried her gun on her person or in her purse to her workplace, which does not permit weapons

Ros' has filed a federal lawsuit claiming that the termination constitutes a violation of her constitutional right to carry arms.

According to the Tampa Tribune, she is seeking monetary damages and attorney fees.

'Iâ€™m a manager of a bank,' Ros told the Tampa Tribune. 'We have a lot of robberies that happen in our banks. I feel safer having that weapon if I ever needed to protect my employees.'

A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to talk about the court case but said the company has clear rules prohibiting employees from bringing weapons onto its premises.

Former manager: Ros used to work at this Oldsmar branch of Wells Fargo until she was fired for bringing a gun to work last year

The company offers an exception in states where individuals are allowed to keep weapons in their locked vehicle in a company parking lot.

Ros told the Tribune that she sometimes left the gun in her car, but often brought it into the bank concealed under her clothing or in her handbag.

Last year, another staff member noticed the gun and reported her to bank officials. She was fired after an investigation by corporate security.

Protection: Ros' attorney says the bank's policy violates her right to arm herself

'I am within my constitutional right,' Ros said. 'The bank is one of the places that I am able to carry a weapon to. My weapon was concealed. I have a certified license.'

Ros' attorney Noel Flasterstein says the company's policy is illegal and that Ros is being discriminated against.

Legal experts disagree.

'There is nothing in the state statute that says the employer has to let her bring it into the building,' Jason Bent, an assistant professor of law at Stetson University, told the Tampa Tribune.
