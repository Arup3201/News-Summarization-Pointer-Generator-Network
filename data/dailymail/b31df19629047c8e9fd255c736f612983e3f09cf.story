A sleeping couple in a Denver suburb were jolted awake by the sound of their car horn at 3am on Monday and called 911 fearing their car was being stolen. Instead they found a black bear sitting behind the wheel.

The smarter-than-average bear had managed to open the unlocked door attracted by the smell of food the couple had left, but managed to lock himself in and started frantically flailing around, setting off the car horn.

When wildlife services arrived to the Castle Pines North, Douglas County home, they simply opened the door and let the agitated bear run away, leaving behind damage to the tune of $15,000.'

'I am in!' The bear was photographed by the Douglas County Sheriff's Office stuck inside the couple's car after letting himself in through an unlocked door

'Our bears are really smart,' said Jennifer Churchill, a public information officer for Colorado Parks and Wildlife.

'If the door’s not locked and it’s one of those lift-latch doors they can get in there.'

Churchill told Fox 31 that in future, the couple will take care to not only lock their car door but not leave food sitting inside - especially as it has cost them a small fortune.

'For the most part, when animals are trapped like that, I think they can get pretty stressed out and agitated,' said Churchill. 'Just like we would.'

'Where to?' The couple were woken up by the sound of their car horn and thought their car was being stolen. It wasn't

Temper: The black bear became agitated inside the SUV and caused $15,000 worth of damage trying to get out

Despite the mildly comical nature of the bear break-in, Churchill said she doubts the bear will ever come back.

'A few years ago in Highlands Ranch, a bear got into a car, flipped the emergency break and rolled all the way down a hill in the car,' said Churchill to Fox 31. 'It was still locked in when our officer came to get it out.

'I don’t think we’ve ever heard from that bear in Highlands Ranch again,' said Churchill. 'I think he took off like a shot.'

Parks and Wildlife in Denver also took the opportunity to remind the public to be especially vigilant now with their property, because of bears looking for food.

'It’s important to keep in mind that this is the time of year,' said Churchill to Fox 31. 'Hyperfasia is when the bears need to eat like 10,000 calories a day, in order to pack on pounds to get through their hibernation during the winter.'

Obstacle: In San Jose, David Tang was woken by the sound of his car alarm and checked his surveillance cameras and saw this mountain lion. The date is incorrect because Mr. Tang has never set it to the correct one

 The mountain lion checked out Mr. Tang's car, but failed to find a way inside the inviting car

And in San Jose, California, on Tuesday, a man was startled awake by the sound of his car alarm, only to check his home surveillance footage to find a mountain lion had set it off by climbing on the roof.

David Tang was woken at 2.50am, but thought nothing of it, assumming a passer-by had caused the alarm to go off.

'I didn’t expect that,' he said to the LA Times after reviewing the footage. 'I thought someone passed by.'

Tang also passed on the video to his neighbors to warn them to beware over the coming days.

'People walk around here at night time and walk with their dogs, so it's dangerous for the people if they don't know,' said Tang to ABC News.

While Tang's neighbors said they think the big cat came out of Almaden County Quicksilver Park, they have only ever seen Coyotes and wild boar.
