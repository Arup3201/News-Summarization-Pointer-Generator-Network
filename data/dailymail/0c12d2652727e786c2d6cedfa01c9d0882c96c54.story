Dutch investigators have found more human remains at the MH17 crash site in Ukraine almost four months after the airliner was shot down over the war-torn country.

An official from separatist authorities in the self declared Donetsk People's Republic, made the announcement today but added it was too early to say if they were of passengers on the doomed flight or of combatants who died in fighting that has taken place in the same area.

The Malaysia Airlines flight from Amsterdam en-route to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down over Ukraine on July 17.

Separatist authorities have said that Dutch investigators have recovered more human remains from the MH17 crash site in Grabove

MH17 was brought down on July 17 with 298 passengers on board, near the village of Grabove

Dutch investigation teams have taken the lead in the operation. Australia committed more than 600 personnel at the height of the mission to search and recover

Accident investigators looking into the July crash are assessing the viability of hiring local contractors to collect wreckage still beyond their reach because of the continuing pro-Russian insurrection

Kiev has blamed pro-Russian separatists for the airliner's destruction while Russia claims a Ukrainian military aircraft brought it down.

The Netherlands is leading a probe into the downing of the Malaysia Airlines jet on July 17, in which all 298 on board, including 193 Dutch nationals, were killed.

At the crash site in Grabove today, barriers could be seen with the message: 'Forbidden area - there could be remains of victims of the MH17 crash here'.

Ella Karakut, a transport official in the separatist government said: 'Human remains have been found by experts from The Netherlands. They will be examined.

'Meanwhile, the work on removing debris from the plane has been suspended.'

The shooting down of flight MH17 as it flew over the conflict zone has stirred angry accusations between Moscow and the West over just who was responsible

Barriers marked "forbidden area - there could be remains of victims of the MH17 crash here" could be seen at the site in Grabove on Friday, AFP journalists said.

The announcement comes after Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said earlier today that there was no chance that all the remains of the victims of MH17 will ever be recovered.

The sobering assessment was made as he met with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and met with some of the 600 Australian personnel involved in the search and recovery mission.

The Dutch government has refused to deal directly with the rebels who control the site, whom it regards as illegitimate

Mr Rutte visited the headquarters of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra earlier today.

In saluting the 'professionalism' of Australian workers he also praised the country's defence chiefs for their swift action, adding that while they had never met before 'it felt like they had worked together for years'.

But there was a reminder that despite all the hard work, there is likely to be heartache for some families.

‘We are still not yet there, we are still trying to get all the remaining remains back,' Mr Rutte said.

'We want to unite, if possible, everybody with their loved ones but we are not absolutely sure that we will be able to do that but we will do everything in our power.'

A Dutch safety board report into the MH17 disaster found, in September, that a 'large number of high-energy objects' penetrated its fuselage.

Dutch PM Mark Rutte said 'we want to unite, if possible, everybody with their loved ones but we are not absolutely sure that we will be able to do that but we will do everything in our power'

The Dutch PM thanked the Australian personnel called into action following the downing of MH17, with 38 Australians on board, 196 Dutch nationals and 43 Malaysian citizens were among the 298 passengers

The Dutch Prime Minister thanked the Australian personnel called into action following the downing of MH17, with 38 Australians on board, 196 Dutch nationals and 43 Malaysian citizens were among the 298 passengers and crew.

It's believed up to 20 victims remain unidentified, at least two of them thought to have ties to Australia.

Mr Rutte again stressed the importance of a thorough, independent investigation into the attack before any decision on those responsible should face trial.

Prime Ministers Mark Rutte (Netherlands) and Tony Abbott (Australia) have worked closely together ever since the July 17 disaster which saw 298 passengers and crew on MH17 killed when it was shot down. On Friday they planted a ceremonial silver birch tree at the National Arboretum in Canberra

The Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott plant a silver birch tree at the National Arboretum  in Canberra. Mr Rutte has been in Australia to discuss the MH17 flight crash that killed 298 passengers and crew on route to Amsterdam from Kuala Lumpur in July

His Australian counterpart agreed that 'it was a very intense time and it’s not yet finished because we have yet to see the perpetrators of this crime brought to justice'.

'We are now in the resolution stages rather than the active response stages,' Mr Abbott added.

'At its heights almost 600 Australian personnel were deployed overseas to the Netherlands and the Ukraine.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott thanks his Dutch counterpart. Mr Abbott is understood to now be seeking a one-on-one meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin when both leaders attend the annual APEC leaders summit in China next week

'It was a textbook case of how Australia can respond at every level. It was our country at its best, even in the worst of times.'

The two leaders then planted a tree at the National Arboretum in Canberra.

The Dutch government has refused to deal directly with the rebels who control the site, whom it regards as illegitimate. It has said investigators are endangered.

Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders was expected to discuss the issue with his Ukrainian counterpart Pavlo Klimkin in Kiev on Saturday.
