Ringo Starr is disgusted that British jihadis in Syria have been nicknamed 'The Beatles', claiming ISIS is against everything his former band stood for.

The nickname was revealed by a former ISIS captive who said the gang of British extremists had been compared to the  group from Liverpool because of their accents.

The man thought to be responsible for beheading American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff has been dubbed 'Jihadi John', while two other British jihadis are being called Paul and Ringo.

Now the drummer has spoken out saying that it is 'b******t' that they have these names as it goes against The Beatles' ideology of peace and love.

Mr Starr told the London Evening Standard: 'What they are doing out there is against everything The Beatles stood for.

'If we stood for anything we never stood for that. The four of us absolutely stood for peace and love.'

But the 74-year-old admits that he and the only other surviving Beatle Paul McCartney are powerless to stop their names being linked to the fanatics despite their fans' fury over their names being linked to the ISIS members.

Mr Starr won a GQ Man of the Year award earlier this week for his humanitarian work, which sees his Peace and Love fund raise money for war veterans who suffer from post-traumatic stress.

Fellow Beatle John Lennon, who died in 1980, was known for his anti-war stance and releases songs such as 'Give Peace A Chance', 'Imagine' and 'Merry Xmas (War Is Over)'

Meanwhile an ISIS defector, who has said that British militant Jihadi John was chosen to execute Americans James Foley and Steven Sotloff because it would make other Westerners feel part of ISIS cause.

The former insurgent, in his 20s and now based in Turkey, said Jihadi John helped to showcase ISIS to Western recruits.

He said: 'It is possible that the goal was to project the image that a European or a Western person executed an American so that they can showcase their Western members and appeal to others outside Syria and make them feel that they belong to the same cause and that they too can do anything in support of ISIS in their respective countries.'

It comes as Prime Minister David Cameron today vowed to 'squeeze' ISIS out of existence and indicated that he may be willing to use the RAF to bomb the terrorist organisation.

He also said that the terrorist, known as Jihad John, believed to be responsible for the murder of the two US journalists, will face justice 'one way or another'.
