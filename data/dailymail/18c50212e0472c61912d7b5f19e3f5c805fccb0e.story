Tulisa Contostavlos has vowed to 'clear her name' after she was found guilty of attacking a celebrity blogger who published her private sex tape.

It was her second court appearance in what she described as a 'rollercoaster week' after she was cleared of dealing drugs on Monday.

Stood outside court yesterday, the N-Dubz star protested her innocence, saying she had not attacked Savvas ‘Vas’ Morgan at V Festival in Essex last year.

The 26-year-old had arrived at Stratford Magistrates’ Court yesterday smiling and full of confidence.

She also sported bee-stung lips which had fans speculating whether she had had surgery.

'This has been a rollercoaster week for me. I never wanted any of this.

'I did not assault Vas J Morgan and I am outraged at this decision. I will be appealing it.

'There are a number of high-profile witnesses who were there and know what happened. I urge them to come forward and tell the truth at the appeal.

'I am determined to clear my name as I have already done once this week. I repeat - I did not assault Vas J Morgan. I am innocent.'

But she shook her head in disbelief after being found guilty of assault and was later heard saying: ‘This is bull****.’

Speaking
 outside the courthouse she said it had been a ‘rollercoaster week’ and 
she was determined to prove her innocence once again.

She said: ‘I did not assault Vas J Morgan and I am outraged at this decision – I will be appealing it.

There
 are a number of high-profile witnesses who were there and know what 
happened. I urge them to come forward and tell the truth.’ 

The criminal record means the singer is unlikely to be welcomed back to mainstream TV.

The attack was said to have taken place in the closing stages of the V Festival in Chelmsford, Essex, last August.

Her
 barrister, Jeremy Dein QC, said she was angry over the sex tape, which 
was published on Mr Morgan’s website in 2012, of her performing a sex 
act on her then boyfriend.

It was removed only after a High Court injunction was granted.

Mr
 Dein added: ‘Mr Morgan played a significant part in humiliating and 
debasing Miss Contostavlos’s reputation, clearly for financial gain.’

Contostavlos
 and her entourage were walking towards the festival’s VIP camping area 
when they clashed with Mr Morgan shortly after midnight. The blogger was
 said to have been hit in the face by

Contostavlos as she went at him with both arms swinging. Mr Morgan suffered a ‘swollen eye’ and reported the attack to police.

District
 Judge Angus Hamilton said the singer was ‘aggressive and 
confrontational’. He said he was ‘quite sure’ she did strike Mr Morgan.

Tulisa was ordered by the court to pay a total of £3,020.

Her assistant, Gareth Varey, 28, was cleared of using threatening behaviour.

Contostavlos was sharply dressed for court in a single breasted suit, a white blouse, and tan coloured heels

In a statement read outside court, Contostavlos said she was 'determined to clear my name'

Earlier this week, Tulisa celebrated after her trial on drugs charges collapsed at Southwark Crown

Court.
 The judge said there were ‘strong grounds’ to believe undercover 
reporter Mazher Mahmood – known as the Fake Sheikh – had lied in the 
witness box.

Last 
night, Mr Morgan – who has joined ITV2 series The Only Way Is Essex – 
said: ‘I’m pleased we can finally put an end to this and move on.’

Tulisa at Southwark Crown Court on Monday

The N-Dubz singer was sensationally cleared of arranging a drugs deal on Monday in a case she claims was a 'horrific and disgusting entrapment'.

The 26 year old had been accused of setting up an £800 cocaine deal, asking her friend Michael Coombs to take drugs to undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood.

He told her he was a ‘big shot’ movie executive offering her a £3million role in a blockbuster starring opposite Leonardo DiCaprio.

But the case collapsed when the reporter, also known as the 'Fake Sheikh', was found to have lied in court.  

When she left Southwark Crown Court, she condemned Mazher Mahmood, the journalist who is known as the Fake Sheikh, for ruining her life for a year and targeting her. 

'This whole case was a horrific and disgusting entrapment by Mazher Mahmood and the Sun on Sunday newspaper.

'Mahmood has now been exposed by my lawyers openly lying to the judge and jury. These lies were told to stop crucial evidence going before the jury. This evidence shows that I told Mahmood's long-standing driver that I disapproved of drugs, which is the truth.

'Thankfully the lies have been uncovered and justice has been done.' 

'It is clear that the driver was pressured to change his statement to strengthen Mahmood's evidence and to damage mine.' 

Mahmood has targeted a raft of celebrities, sportsmen and royals in tabloid stings, is now set to be investigated by the police and has been suspended by the Sun on Sunday newspaper.

He could face jail for perjury and perverting the course of justice after it emerged that he ‘deliberately lied’ in court about manipulating a key witness by persuading him to retract a police statement suggesting Miss Contostavlos disapproved of drugs.

Her assistant, Gareth Varey, was cleared of using threatening behaviour during the incident last August. 

Earlier this week, a drugs trial against Contostavlos collapsed at Southwark Crown Court after the judge said there were 'strong grounds' to believe that undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood - known as the Fake Sheikh - had lied in the witness box.

Earlier in the trial, the singer told the court that Mr Morgan conducted a 'vendetta' against her since an incident in which she asked security to remove him from a VIP area at the Whisky Mist nightclub in London’s Mayfair.

She also claimed she believed Mr Morgan was involved in the release of a sex tape of her online. But added that she had no grudge against him, saying: 'He was one of many.'

Since the incident, Mr Morgan has become a regular cast member on ITV's TOWIE. 

At the end of the hearing, he said: ‘I’m pleased we can finally put an end to this and move on. It’s been a difficult time for everyone involved and i’d just like to put it behind me. I’ve had my character questioned and now feel vindicated by the verdict.'
