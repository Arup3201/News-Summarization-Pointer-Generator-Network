Despite food shortages in rural areas, reports of concentration camps and rising tensions between it and its neighbours, North Korea is a wonderful place to be - according to its rulers at least.

Now the ridiculous nature of their claims has been laid bare by a series of Instagram videos created by Associated Press photojournalist, David Guttenfelder.

From bleak country dwellings covered in peeling paint to a girl eating lunch under a television showing a military parade, it offers a rare look at the realities of life inside the Hermit Kingdom.

Military might: The North Korean army is omnipresent with parades and rallies a regular part of life

Guttenfelder, who has made 17 trips to the country since 2000, made the films during a visit in April when he was invited to witness a nuclear missile launch by the regime.

Despite travelling with a government 'minder', Guttenfelder's images paint a shocking portrait of life inside the Communist country - one that is entirely at odds with the official version.

'[North Korea] is an endlessly fascinating and visually surreal place, but it is also one of the hardest countries I have ever photographed,' writes Guttenfelder in a Huffington Post blog for the Associated Press.

'As one of the few international photographers with regular access to the country, I consider it a huge responsibility to show life there as accurately as I can.'

Few foreigners, he adds, are allowed to leave the showpiece capital, Pyongyang, while the presence of minders makes getting photos of anything that doesn't toe the official line almost impossibly hard.

That Guttenfelder has managed to get so many is an impressive feat, particularly as many reveal the all-pervasive influence of the country's military as well as a rare shot of guards patrolling the border with South Korea.

Others show a surreal military conference where rows of identically dressed men clap perfectly in time, while others show grim Soviet style apartment blocks and equally grim looking soldiers standing guard beside the Unha-3 rocket at Sohae Satellite Station in Tongchang-ri.

'My window on North Korea is sometimes, quite literally, a window – of a hotel room, the backseat of a car, a train,' adds Guttenfelder.

'Fleeting moments of daily life present themselves suddenly, and they are opportunities to show a side of the country that is entirely at odds with the official portrait of marching troops and tightly coordinated pomp that the Pyongyang leadership presents to the world.'

Stalinist: North Korea calls itself a socialist utopia but in reality operates similarly to the former Soviet Union

The Korean War, which ended almost exactly 60 years ago on the 27th July 1953,  brought 
the Kim dynasty to power and set the scene for decades of tension between it and 
its southern neighbour.

On the country's official website, 
North Korean authorities describe the country as 'the Juche-oriented socialist 
state which embodies the idea and leadership of Comrade Kim II Sung, the
 founder of the Republic and the father of socialist Korea.'

In reality, North Korea is home to 
the world's last Stalinist regime and it shares many characteristics 
with the former Soviet Union, not least a marked penchant for secrecy.

More recently, the regime's pursuit of nuclear arms has brought it into conflict with Western powers - the United States in particular - while relations with its main ally, China, appear increasingly lukewarm.

Currently, tension centres around the
 Unha-3 rocket programme, which could, if developed further, eventually 
develop a long enough range to make a strike on Los Angeles possible.

While the country is yet to fire a missile in anger, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened the USA with a pre-emptive nuclear strike in March, describing the US as the 'sworn enemy of the Korean people.'

The regime also pulled out of the 1953 armistice with South Korea and said they would end all mutual non-aggression pacts. 

Although the regime has since backtracked and has opened talks with its southern neighbour,  Japan increase its defence budget for 
the first time in decades, while the USA has
threatened to defend itself if necessary.
