How bad does a tackle have to be to earn a red card in the Premier League these days?

Watching the closing stages of Manchester United’s win at Southampton, I was disappointed but not surprised to see Sadio Mane escape with just a booking from Kevin Friend after wiping out Robin van Persie with a tackle that could have hurt the striker.

Select group officials are refereeing with so much leniency we cannot be surprised when dangerous tackles are not punished strongly.

A different type of foul also escaped censure at St Mary’s on Monday night when Marouane Fellaini fouled Victor Wanyama with his feet and followed through with his arm. Dangerous play but not even a yellow card was given. 

Friend is not alone - there were at least four other red-card challenges at the weekend where the guilty players stayed on the pitch.

Manchester City had a double let-off from Andre Marriner, who failed to dismiss Eliaquim Mangala for what can only be described as a flying karate kick on Everton’s Samuel Eto’o. There can be no excuse in this case – it should have been a straight red.

Mangala’s team-mate Fernando later challenged Gareth Barry with his boot at head height and despite appearing to catch his fellow midfielder, he escaped with a yellow card. If there was any contact then he too should have been dismissed for serious foul play.

Down at Loftus Road, Charlie Austin was given a short reprieve when Jon Moss pulled out the yellow card after the striker dived in on Burnley’s Kieran Trippier. 

It was a poor challenge with studs leading and landing on Trippier’s ankle. Austin did get a second yellow shortly after but he shouldn’t have been on the pitch following that tackle on Trippier.

In Sunday’s game between Aston Villa and Leicester, Jamie Vardy’s challenge on Ashley Westwood ticked all the boxes for a red card as it was made at pace with a scissors-type action and he showed no regard for his opponent’s safety. Westwood went off on a stretcher but Vardy stayed on.

It is clear that referees are trying to officiate in a low-key way this season and are letting a lot more go, which fans enjoy. No-one pays money to watch a ref and it’s always disappointing to see a player sent off early in a game that you have spent a lot of money going to.

However, these tackles are dangerous and if referees continue to only dish out yellow cards they will become more prevalent and players will be hurt.

The referees’ top priority in a game is the players’ safety and too many are not keeping this in the forefront of their minds.
