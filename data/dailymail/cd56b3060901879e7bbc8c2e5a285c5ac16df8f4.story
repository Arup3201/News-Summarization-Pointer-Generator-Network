A mother and her three sons were killed in a horrific head-on collision with a tractor after their SUV careered into the other lane.

The deaths of Stephanie Brown, 31, eight-month-old Grayson Brown, Jackson Brown, seven, and Gage Brown, nine, have shocked and overwhelmed members of the close-knit extended family and their community, after they were killed on State Highway 61 in Roane County, Tennessee on Tuesday.

Stephanie Brown was said to be 
returning from a visit with her grandmother when her 2004 Ford 
Expedition crossed the centre line of the highway and struck the 
oncoming tractor-trailer.

Both vehicles burst into flames but driver of the tractor, Joe Sexton, 57, did not require medical treatment.

Mr Sexton reportedly tried to help 
the occupants of the SUV, but they were pinned by the vehicle's engine, 
which had been driven into the back seat by the impact.

The Rev John Edwards, pastor of New Fairview Baptist Church, is the uncle of Stephanie Brown and described the families as 'crushed and devastated' by the tragedy. Her husband Josh Brown is obviously still in shock.'

He said the couple grew up in Oliver Springs, were high school sweethearts while attending Oliver Springs High School and married 'right out of high school'.

Jackson Brown was a first-grader at Bowers Elementary School in Harriman, while his older brother, Gage, was in fourth grade.

Dr Toni McGriff, director of Roane County Schools, said on Wednesday additional counselling was and will be made available to staff and students for as long as is needed.

Clarence Nelson, chief of the Blair Volunteer Fire Department, said: 'It looked like they were killed instantly. It was a terrible accident.

'Everything was burned. There was no paperwork, no VIN (vehicle identification number) available.'

Tennessee Highway Patrol Sgt Bobby Clevenger says it's unknown why the SUV veered into the other lane but no charges will be filed.

Neighbours along Coalfield Road say the boys and their mother radiated love.

'You have to give that much love for a child to take in, and actually show it to other people,' said Chris Turpin. 'My prayers go out to the family.'

'I don't know. I couldn't even begin to imagine how that feels,' said neighbour Jordan Williams.

Just weeks ago, the Browns attended New Fairview for Vacation Bible School. rev Edwards says now he must lead his congregation and his family through a trying time.

'All of Fairview church and of course, all of Fairview community, have been so very supportive of family, in their grief, comforting and doing what they can for them,' he said.
