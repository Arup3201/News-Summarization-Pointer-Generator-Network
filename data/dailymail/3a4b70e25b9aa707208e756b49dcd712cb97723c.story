A happier hen makes really tasty eggs.

At least that's the reasoning behind this humorous video of of a behind-the-scenes look at the 2015 Nice Pecks calendar.

The Happy Egg Company took on board findings from research that showed the happier the hen is, the tastier the eggs will be, and rounded up some handsome cockerels trying their hand at eggs-treme sports.

Eventually this cockerel gets into the football boots for his special sporty shot

It was a bit of a try, but this character settled down and got involved in a nice rugby picture

The artistic sports scenes will then be made into a special calendar for the hens down at the Happy Egg farm to provide them with some special enjoyment.

First up is the star striker cockerel, who fits perfectly into a pair of football boots.

Then it's the rugby-loving cockerel's turn in the spotlight, who struts his stuff, flaps his wings, and is snapped  perfectly for a shot kicking the egg-shaped ball through the posts.

It is hoped the cockerel calendar will be enjoyed by the hens at the Happy Egg Company

There were a few tense moments on the pommel horse, but this cockerel soon faced the camera and got snapped

It was game, set and match for this stud, as he settled up next to the tennis ball

Celebrity and sports photographer Ian Derry, who was involved in the production of the calendar, said: 'I've photographed many famous people and many famous athletes.

'It was a good day, we got some great shots of some very athletic feathered sportsmen, that should keep the girls happy down at the farm.' 

Also included for the calendar is a gymnastics scene, and a tennis shot.  

Skateboarding was another sport to feature on the calendar of eggs-treme sports

This cockerel fancied going surfing in one of the more unbelievable scenes
