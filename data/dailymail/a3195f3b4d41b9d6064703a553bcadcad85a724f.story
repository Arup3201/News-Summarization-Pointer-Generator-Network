Jack Wilshere has promised Arsenal fans he is doing everything in his power to ensure a speedy return from injury.

The 22-year-old was ruled out for three months at the end of November after undergoing surgery on damaged ligaments in his left ankle. He sustained the injury in the defeat by Manchester United after a heavy tackle from Paddy McNair.

But Wilshere showed he was already working hard on his return by posting a photo online of him working in the gym while wearing a protective boot.

He said: 'Doing what I can I [sic] be back as soon as possible... #Grind #HardWorkBeatsTalent.' 

Wilshere also posted a video of his workout. It showed the midfielder whipping two ropes up and down. Although it may not look too taxing, Wilshere assured fans it was.

He said: 'If you know then you know....2 x 30 seconds of this is enough to test anyone!' 

Reports were circulating earlier this month suggesting Wilshere had suffered a setback but Arsene Wenger denied the rumours.

Speaking to the club's website, he said: 'How long will Wilshere be out? Three months, and he had no setback. He is just in a boot, he cannot have a setback because he does not practise.'

When asked about Wilshere again this week he reiterated that the England midfielder's recovery was 'progressing as planned'.
