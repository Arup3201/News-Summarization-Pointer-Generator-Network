The BBC launched a sweeping investigation into Top Gear after its presenter Jeremy Clarkson was accused of racism, it has emerged.

The inquiry was triggered after the 54-year-old was embroiled in a series of race rows, culminating in his grovelling apology for apparently using the word n***** during an outtake.

Following the incident in May, Clarkson was handed a final warning but escaped the sack. However to avoid future embarrassments, TV controller Danny Cohen reportedly ordered a review of the show’s culture and practices.

Investigation: The BBC has launched a probe into Top Gear after a string of controversies. The show's presenters built a bridge over the River Kwai in Thailand during a series finale and Clarkson commented that there was a 'slope' on it - just as a man of Asian descent walked towards them

Although the BBC has refused to 
release the findings of the investigation, which began in June and took 
between four and six weeks, it is understood that all Top Gear staff 
were asked for their views on whether the hit show is racist.

They 
were also asked whether they felt afraid to speak out to their superiors
 when they felt parts of the programme were offensive.

And 
investigators interviewed Clarkson and his co-presenters James May and 
Richard Hammond as well as Top Gear’s executive producer Andy Wilman. 
The stars of the show were reportedly reminded of their 
‘responsibilities as BBC employees’.

Clarkson was forced to deny allegations that he was caught on camera using the n-word during filming of the hit BBC series

After the inquiry was completed 
last month, Mr Cohen met with production bosses to discuss the issues 
raised in the report. It is understood that he wanted to launch 
disciplinary action against Clarkson, but was blocked by BBC 
director-general Lord Hall.

The latest race row in May was sparked 
when unused footage from Top Gear emerged showing the £1million a year 
host swinging his finger between two cars while reciting a notoriously 
racist children’s nursery rhyme. In the clip, he could be heard 
chanting: ‘Eeny, meeny, miny, moe’ before apparently mumbling ‘Catch a 
n***** by his toe’.

Clarkson initially denied he used the word, but 
later issued a humiliating video message in which he said he was 
‘mortified’ by the upset he had caused, and ‘begged forgiveness’ of his 
fans.

Yesterday the BBC refused to comment, but this was just the 
latest in a long line of controversies involving the outspoken star.

Last
 week, broadcasting regulator Ofcom found he ‘deliberately’ used racist 
language during an episode filmed in Burma which was screened in March.

He
 caused outrage when he said a bridge with an Asian man walking across 
it had a ‘slope on it’. Producers apologised but said it was 
‘light-hearted wordplay’ and claimed he did not know the term was 
offensive. Clarkson provoked more fury in April by naming his black 
terrier Didier Dogba after Ivory Coast footballer Didier Drogba.

In 
2012, the presenter compared synchronised swimming to the deaths of 23 
Chinese cockle pickers in Morecambe Bay in 2004, and provoked a flood of
 complaints in 2011 when he said his new TV’s energy-saving setting made
 it seem as if programmes were being ‘presented by Lenny Henry in a 
cave’.

The BBC also had to apologise after Clarkson and his co-hosts 
cracked offensive jokes about Mexicans, prompting an official complaint 
by the Mexican ambassador.

And another 31,000 viewers complained when
 he joked that striking public sector workers should be ‘executed in 
front of their families’.

That was not the first - or last time - that Jeremy Clarkson has sparked controversy with some of his comments.

Weeks later, in unaired footage of the series, the 54-year-old presenter was heard reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe'.

It took place during filming of the third episode of Top Gear series 19 as the star reviewed the £25,000 Toyota GT86 and the Subaru BRZ - which costs around the same amount.

Telling viewers that they may find it difficult to differentiate between the two vehicles he demonstrated how to do it using the child's counting rhyme.

After initially denying the claims, Clarkson 'begged' for forgiveness, saying he 'did everything in [his] power to not use that word', but that his 'efforts weren't quite good enough.'

Jeremy Clarkson was also accused of racism for naming his black West Highland terrier dog Didier Dogba after former Chelsea star Didier Drogba, who is from the Ivory Coast.

Clarkson, who often mocks political correctness, asked: 'Why is it racist to name our amazingly brilliant dog after a footballer?'

In December 2011, the controversial host came under under fire for suggesting public sector strikers 'be shot in front of their families'.

Weeks later, he provoked a fresh storm of protest after describing people who kill themselves by jumping under trains as 'selfish'.

In his newspaper column in The Sun, Clarkson wrote that 'foxy woxy and the birds' should be left to 'nibble' at the 'gooey parts' of people who die by jumping in front of trains.
