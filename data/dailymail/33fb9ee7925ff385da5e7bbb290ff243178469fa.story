Women delaying have children into their forties has seen a rise in the number of twins and triplets, new figures showed today.

The number of women giving birth after turning 40 has risen steadily in recent years, with multiple births most likely amongst the over-45s.

The Office for National Statistics said this higher multiple maternity rate was linked to women turning to IVF to start a family, which is more likely to lead to twins or triplets.

The number of multiple births to women over 40 has risen sharply in the last 30 years, the Office for National Statistics found

Women aged 30-34 gave birth to the most twins in 2013, according to the latest figures

More triplets were both to women aged 35-39 than any other age group last year, the study found

New figures released today show that in 2013 there were 10,593 women who gave birth to twins, 187 to triplets and 3 to quads and above.

Last year 15.6 out of every 1,000 women who gave birth had more than one baby, compared to 9.6 multiple maternities per 1,000 in 1976.

In 1976, women aged 35-39 had the highest multiple maternity rate (13.4 per 1,000 maternities).

The ONS said: ‘Between 1976 and 2011 the multiple maternity rate increased for all age groups, but most notably for women aged 30 and over.

‘The greatest increase was among women aged 45 and over where the multiple maternity rate rose from 9.8 in 1976, to 99.3 in 2011.’

Most new mothers in their forties gave birth to their first child, while 52 already had four or more children

The proportion of children who give birth at home has fallen dramatically since the 1960s

Giving birth at home has risen in popularity among the under-thirties, but fallen among older age groups

The number of women in their twenties giving birth at home has risen in the last decade, figures show.

Overall in England and Wales last year, 2.3 per cent women giving birth did so at home.

In 1960, the percentage of women giving birth at home was 33 per cent, but this fell to a record low between 1985 and 1988 when only 0.9 per cent of women gave birth at home.

But the ONS said: 'The percentages of women giving birth at home have decreased in all age groups for women aged 30 and over and have increased in all age groups under 30.'

Among under-20s, 1 per cent gave birth at home, 1.6 per cent of women aged 20-24 and 2 per cent of women aged 25-29. 

Between 2012 and 2013 the rate of multiple births fell for every age group, apart from women aged 40-44.

The ONS found that women aged 45 and over ‘had by far the highest multiple maternity rate’ in 2013 at 95 per 1,000 maternities. Women aged under 20 had the lowest rate at just 6.1 per 1,000 maternities.

Women are more likely to give birth to twins if they have fertility treatment.

On average, 1 in 5 of IVF pregnancies result in multiple babies, compared to 1 in 80 for women who conceive naturally, according to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.

Around 17,000 IVF were babies born in the UK in 2011 and the average age of women undergoing IVF treatment in 2012 was 35.

The ONS said: ‘The high multiple maternity rate among women aged 45 and over is a result of higher levels of assisted fertility treatments (including medicines which stimulate ovulation and assisted conception which includes IVF) at these ages.’

In 2009 the HFEA launched a policy to reduce the number of multiple births.

Babies born with a sibling are more likely to have a lower birth weight.

As a result, the infant mortality rate is around five times higher for multiple births than for singleton births.
