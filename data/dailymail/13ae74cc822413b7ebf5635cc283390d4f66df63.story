A police operation has busted a major interstate crime ring, seizing more than $1 million worth of cannabis during their investigations and made 33 arrests.

This week, police raided more than 50 properties in South Australia, as well as five properties in Western Australia and Northern Territory, as part of Operation Deluge which was launched in January.

On Monday alone, the raids found more than 50kg of dried cannabis, 312 cannabis plants, $100,500 in cash, and 13 weapons worth almost $700,000 – including firearms, Tasers and a crossbow.

More than 50 homes were raided in Adelaide, as well as 5 in Western Australia and Northern Territory, of people believed to also be involved in the interstate drug distribution ring

It's believed the drugs were planned to distributed to other states from Adelaide.

24 arrests were made yesterday, with 20 people in South Australia taken into custody.

Now, in total, Operation Deluge has arrested 33 people involved in the distribution of illegal drugs.

Detective Chief Inspector Steve Taylor warned drug dealers that both the state and Federal Police are committed to uncovering illegal activity.

'We can fairly confidently say in this case it's not just a disruption, but is a complete dismantling of this criminal syndicate,' Inspector Taylor said, according to news.com.au.

'The message here is clear, if you deal in illicit drugs there is a strong probability that you will be caught,' he said.

'It may take us some time to catch you but we will. Don't risk it.'

They are 'very pleased' with the success of the operation, led by South Australia Police's Serious and Organised Crime Branch, alongside the Australian Federal Police.

'We can fairly confidently say in this case it's not just a disruption, but is a complete dismantling of this criminal syndicate,' Inspector Taylor said

'Just because you might get away with it for a short period of time, you can rest assured we will continue on until we build a fairly good brief of evidence against those people responsible and we will bring them before the courts.'

Three people from Western Australia and one from Northern Territory, believed to be complicit in the drug distribution ring, were also arrested.

11 people were refused bail.
