A 42-year-old man, believed to have been known to both victims, was arrested by gardai in connection with the deaths.

A Garda spokesman said the suspect was being held at a station in Buncrana under the provisions of Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act.

There are conflicting reports about how the elderly couple may have died.

The grim discovery was made just after 9am today.

Mr Cuddihy, a technology teacher at Carndonagh Community School, was also a past captain of Ballyliffan Golf Club and was described as a 'jovial' and 'bubbly character' on its website.

Fianna Fail councillor Martin McDermott, a family friend, said the close-knit community had been left reeling by news of the tragedy.

'The community is just numb,' he said. 'You do not think things like this will happen on your doorstep but, sadly they do.

'It is a very sad day. The couple would be very well-known and were well-liked in the area. They have a big family connection in the town.

'I would have known them personally and would have worked with them as part of my own work. It really is a tragedy.'

A priest was called to the house to administer the last rites just before 10am.

The large, well-kept bungalow has been sealed off for much of the day pending a garda forensic examination.

Floral tributes have been left at the driveway to the property.

Albert Doherty, Sinn Fein councillor in Carndonagh, who knew the family, said everyone was still trying to come to terms with the tragedy.

He said: 'They are a very well known family; very respected and very popular.

'The man of the house was a retired teacher and his wife was a nurse who would have assisted a large number of people in the ambulance service between Inishowen and Letterkenny Hospital where she was a nurse.

'To die in their own home and in their own community is very tragic. Our thoughts are with the family members who are grief-stricken at this time.'

The Office of the State Pathologist has been informed but later the bodies were still inside the house.

Parish priest, Fr Con McLaughlin, who is on holiday in Spain, said been shocked by the tragic news but declined to give further comment until he returned to Carndonagh and had spoken with the family.

Fianna Fail councillor Rena Donaghey also said the community had been left stunned by the deaths.

She said: 'It is truly shocking. Cardonagh is a small town and the close-knit community has been left in shock by the news.'
