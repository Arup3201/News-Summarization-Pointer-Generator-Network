The body of a starved springer spaniel found dumped near a school, was at the centre of an RSPCA investigation.

The  emaciated animal, that was described as just 'skin and bones,' was discovered wrapped in a blue horse rug inside a blue and grey plastic kennel. 

The grim discovery of the male tan and white spaniel was made by a dog walker after it had been discarded behind a pipe by the side of a road in Iwade, near Sittingbourne, Kent, just yards from a local school.

The RSPCA has launched an investigation to find out what happened to the starved springer spaniel

Today the RSPCA were trying to track down the animal's callous owners after saying they believed the dog had suffered in the run up to its death.  

RSPCA animal welfare officer Kelly Thatcher is leading the investigation into the neglected animal, who was found without any identification and is thought to be about five years old.

The discovery was made close to Iwade C.P. School. 

The discovery comes just months after a dead border collie, also emaciated, was found in nearby bushes.

 'It wasn't much of a Happy Christmas for this poor dog - who had clearly suffered leading up to his death,' said Ms Thatcher.

'I was shocked at how thin he was - completely skin and bones.

'At first I had hoped he had died a natural death and then been dumped, but seeing how thin he was, and young, I doubt it.

'It was also such a callous way to dump the poor dog. Over the fence and lying among all manner of rubbish.

'We urge anyone with any information about this incident to let us know on 0300 123 8018.'

The discovery of the dog was made near Iwade C.P School in Iwade, near Sittingbourne, Kent
