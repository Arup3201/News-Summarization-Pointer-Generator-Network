There was an old woman who lived in a shoe... and now it turns out that you can too.

Described as a size 318 boot, this whimsical guest house is owned by husband and wife Steve and Judy Van-Den Yssel-Richards.

Located on the very north tip of New Zealand's South Island, this one-bedroom cottage nestled in picturesque hazelnut groves looks as though it has appeared straight from the pages of a fairytale book.

Straight out of a fairytale: Husband and wife Steve and Judy Van-Den Yssel-Richards hand-built this boot-shaped cottage

Luxury: The cottage comes complete with a shower built for two, an open fireplace and courtyard

Romantic: The Van-Den Yssel-Richards designed the cottage to be the perfect escape for couples

But it was hand-built by the couple, who spent over a year perfecting their unusual home - and have now opened it to guests too.

Despite looking like an old boot, the luxury cottage packs in a shower built for two, courtyard and open fireplace in the living room.

And wannabe boot-dwellers can live out the dream for just Â£150 a night.

Twee: The bedroom has been decorated in keeping with the fairytale feel of the rest of the cottage

Specially made: The shower has been designed to fit two people

Inspiration: The boot looks very similar to the pictures used to demonstrate the nursery rhyme There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe

Unusual: The unique living room area where couples can relax in front of an open fire place

Judy said: 'The idea came from one of those conversations that start in one place and sort of spiral out of control.

'We wanted to create a unique place for couples to stay so they could get away from the stresses of life and really re-connect with each other.

'It started off as a giant teapot, then a tree house but eventually we got on to a boot, which really stuck out, and we just wanted to run with. So we did!'

Shoe accommodation: The Van-Den Yssel-Richards describe the cottage as a 'size 318 boot'

Dining al fresco: The outside courtyard is the ideal spot for couples to enjoy a romantic meal or glass of wine

Reception: The Jester House Cafe where guests arrive before being taken to their boot cottage accommodation

Getaway: The Van-Den Yssel-Richards claim their guest-house is the ideal spot for couples to get away from it all and unwind
