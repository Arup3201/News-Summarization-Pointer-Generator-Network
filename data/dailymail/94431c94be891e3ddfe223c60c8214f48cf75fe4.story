Vinyl fanatics everywhere rejoice - the beloved LP is not a thing of the past and the world's largest one ever is currently spinning in California.

A 407ft-wide 'record' of The Eagles classic album Hotel California is spinning at a rate of 17 miles an hour on the rooftop of The Forum in Inglewood, California.Â 

The mocked-up record has been spinning since New 
Year's Day and is being used to promote the re-opening of the concert 
venue after a $100million refurbishment.

The Eagles, one of the most successful bands to come out of Southern California, are playing The Forum from January 15 for several dates until January 25.

Their hit song Hotel California is being 'played' from the rooftop for fans to hear as they enter the venue.

The vinyl album was constructed over the winter holidays and consists of 5.7 acres of printed vinyl, 2,000 feet of curved aluminum and a mile of aluminum truss.

Creators of the record Pop2Life told Today that they had to get approval from the Federal Aviation Authority to build it due to restrictions on the height and scale of a structure so near the airport.
