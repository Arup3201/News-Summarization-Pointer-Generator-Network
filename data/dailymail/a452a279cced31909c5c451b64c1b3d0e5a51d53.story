Big prize: Corey Knowlton is believed to be the man who paid $350,000 for the license to shoot a black rhino

The hunter who paid $350,000 at a Dallas auction on Saturday to hunt a black rhino, one of the most endangered animals on the planet, says not to judge him - he cares 'deeply' about all animals.

Corey Knowlton, who has faced death threats since ponying up the cash to hunt the endangered animal, took to Facebook on Monday to respond to the mounting criticism.

'Thank you all for your comments about conservation and the current situation regarding the black rhino. I am considering all sides and concerns involved in this unique situation,' Knowlton wrote on his Facebook page. 'Please don't rush to judgment with emotionally driven criticism towards individuals on either sides of this issue. I deeply care about all of the inhabitants of this planet and I am looking forward to more educated discussion regarding the ongoing conservation effort for the black rhino.'

The 'license to kill' was sold by the Dallas Safari Club in conjunction with the Namibian government, as a minister from the African country was said to be jumping up and down in elation at the result because the funds go to conservation efforts in the country.

Conservation: Knowlton claims to love all animals on the planet and is a big supporter of conservation efforts

Mr
 Knowlton is an active hunter who arranges shooting trips around the 
globe, and regularly posts updates of pictures on his Facebook profile 
of himself with clients and the dead animals that they kill.

The
 hacktivist group Anonymous has now become involved in the debate and 
launched a virtual attack- which they have named as OpFunKill- on 
hunters involved with the auction.

'Unspeakable
 and terrible things happen every second of every day while the whole 
planet is forced to watch, as these cold hearted soulless zombies cause 
horrific suffering and death to animals, both common, vulnerable and 
critically endangered species,' they said in a manifesto.

Mr
 Knowlton, a married father of two young daughters, is a part of the 
Hunting Consortium and his company biography boasts that he has worked 
in the hunting tourism industry for more than a decade.

'Corey Knowlton has hunted widely on 6 continents taking more than 120 species, including a Super Slam of wild sheep and the big five in Africa.' it states.

He lists conservation as one of his major interests, which stays in line with the Dallas Safari Club's claims that the sale of the license helps protect the endangered species by focusing on the killing of specific, older and arguably more aggressive beasts.

The animal that is listed as the target involved with this weekend's sale is Ronnie, an older bull rhino who can no longer breed.

Club spokesman Steve Wagner told The Dallas Morning News that the animal was likely becoming a threat to other wildlife as he is getting more aggressive in his old age.

the 1960s. Nearly 1,800 are in Namibia, according to the safari club.

The Dallas Safari Club sale, which has been condemned by environmental groups, was offering the chance to shoot the rare beast as a way to raise funds for the species' conservation.

While there were protesters at the event and animal rights groups have regularly spoken out against the sales of hunting licenses, the organizers were more upset that they didn't raise more money- as they were originally hoping to reach the million-dollar mark.

'It annoys me to tears,' said Hanns-Louis Lamprecht, who runs a safari company in Namibia.

'I was so angry last night. A million dollars would have lasted years, years in the conservation efforts...The fact is it could have been more — it could have been a lot more,' he told The Dallas Morning News.

After complaints and protests about the 
sale, the FBI said earlier this week that it was investigating death 
threats against members of the club.

About 40 protesters held signs and chanted outside the convention center where the 
auction and dinner took place.

Jim

 and Lauren Ries traveled from Atlanta to join the protest after their 
children Carter, 12, and Olivia, 11, asked if they could campaign.

'We heard what the
 Dallas Safari Club was doing and we thought it was just wrong that they
 were auctioning off to kill a black rhino and we really got upset that 
they were thinking this,' Carter said.

The family run a nonprofit organization, One More Generation, which is dedicated to saving endangered species. 

The Dallas Safari Club has adopted a new definition of the ideal hunt-able male African lion as well as the rhino

'There's less than 5,000 black rhinos
 left on the planet and if our kids ever want to see
 a rhino left in the wild, we can't be pulling the trigger on every one 
we say is too old to breed,' Mr Ries said.

Ben
 Carter, executive director of the Safari Club, defended the auction. He
 said all money raised will go toward rhino conservation efforts.

He also said the rhino that the 
winner will hunt is old, male and non breeding — and that the animal was
 likely to be targeted for removal anyway because it was becoming 
aggressive and threatening other wildlife.

Mr Carter added that wildlife experts say culling a herd is an acceptable habitat management practice.

'In most cases, this animal is detrimental,' Mr Carter said. 'He's past his prime.'

But
 critics have questioned that logic. Officials from the Humane Society 
and the International Fund for Animal Welfare have said that while 
culling can be appropriate in abundant animal populations, all black 
rhinos should be protected, given their endangered status.

Critics have also said any hunting of a rhino sends a bad message to the public.

This
 auction is telling the world that an American will pay anything to kill
 their species,' Jeffrey Flocken, North American regional director of 
the Massachusetts-based IFAW, said earlier this week.

'This is, in fact, making a spectacle of killing an endangered species.'

The
 auction took place in downtown Dallas under tight security and behind 
closed doors. Organizers hoped to at least break the previous high bid 
for one of the permits in Namibia, which is $223,000.
