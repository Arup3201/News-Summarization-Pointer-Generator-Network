An American Airlines plane was forced to make an emergency landing after it was hit by a flock of birds. 

The AA Boeing 777-200 was taking off from Chicago's O'Hare airport when it was struck by birds on Saturday.

The close call is the fourth time the U.S. airline has had to make an unscheduled landing in just three weeks.

All four passenger planes landed safely.

The captain of the Shanghai-bound flight on Saturday declared an emergency after the bird strike and returned to the airport.

Five ambulances were sent to the scene as a precaution by the Chicago Fire Department but it landed safely.

There were no reports of injuries to the 237 passengers or 15 crew on board and customers were scheduled for a later flight.

The plane was then taken away for maintenance.

The close call comes just five days after a second AA plane from O'Hare had to make an emergency landing when a pilot became ill.

It had been in the air for about an hour en route to Dallas, Texas, when it was forced to land at St Louis airport.

The first officer was taken to hospital, Fox Chicago reported, and the plane continued with a new cockpit crew.

Last month, a Boeing 757 carrying 172 people made an emergency landing after smoke was reported in the cockpit.

The plane was flying from San Jose, Costa Rica, to Miami, Florida, when it was forced to stop at Colombia's San Andres Island.

Three days earlier, on September 17, engine trouble also grounded an AA flight at Indianapolis International Airport.

None of the 142 passengers on board were reported injured and later continued on their journey to Dallas, Texas. 

The four emergency landings are not believed to be related.

Mail Online has contacted American Airlines for comment.
