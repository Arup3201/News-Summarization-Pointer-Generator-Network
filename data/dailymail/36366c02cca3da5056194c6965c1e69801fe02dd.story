Mexican artist Frida Kahlo's native garden and studio will be reimagined at the New York Botanical Garden in the spring.

The garden will use flowers and plants native to Mexico in the exhibition 'Frida Kahlo: Art, Garden, Life,' which will open May 16 and run through November 1.

The exhibition in New York City will reflect the bright colors and textures of Kahlo's portraits and still lifes.

Famed for her colourful but disturbing self-portraits, that unabashed mono-brow, a turbulent marital relationship with fellow artist Diego Rivera and a raft of severe health problems, Kahlo, who was born in 1907, has fascinated art lovers for decades.

The exhibit will feature about a dozen original paintings and drawings highlighting her use of botanical imagery.

Photos of Kahlo and her husband, muralist Diego Rivera, also will be shown.

The Enid A. Haupt Conservatory will be transformed into Kahlo's Blue House (Casa Azul) studio and garden outside Mexico City.

It was decorated in traditional Mexican folk-art objects, Colonial-era art, native plants and religious ex-voto paintings that depict a tragedy or someone with a grave illness or injury.

Among the features at the botanical garden will be a lava rock path lined with flowers. 

There also will be a scale version of a pyramid at Casa Azul that was created to display pre-Columbian art collected by her husband, muralist Diego Rivera. 

It will be filled with traditional Mexican terra cotta pots.

The exhibition also will have a dozen of her original paintings and drawings on view at the nearby LuEsther T. Mertz Library's art gallery.

The exhibition 'will provide an in-depth look at Kahlo's work and artistic environment and also celebrate the energy and sophistication of Mexican culture,' said Gregory Long, president and CEO of the garden.

It will be curated by art historian and Mexican art specialist Adriana Zavala.

The garden did a similar recreation in 2012 of Claude Monet's flower and water gardens and home at Giverny in the north of France.

The same year an exhibition of her clothes, orthopaedic paraphernalia and even prosthetic limbs were displayed inside one of the Mexico City homes she shared with her husband.

Smoke and Mirrors: Frida Kahlo's Dresses displays 300 accessories, corsets, clothes and health contraptions worn by Kahlo that have been locked away for over 50 years since her death in 1954, aged 47. 

The exhibit explored Kahlo's unique wardrobe which was chiefly inspired by Mexico's indigenous women who were famous for their richly embroidered frocks, flowery headpieces and ornate silver jewellery.

But beneath her long dresses, Kahlo hid a body that had been contorted by childhood polio and then only just survived a horrific bus crash. Kahlo contracted polio when she was young, and the disease stunted the growth of her right leg.

When she was 18, a metal tube pierced through her abdomen during a bus crash, subjecting her to painful operations and long periods of bed rest throughout her life. 

She had her right leg amputated in 1953, a year before her death.
