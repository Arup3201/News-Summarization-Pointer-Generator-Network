A mother has lost more than 9st after she became so overweight she put her baby in danger during childbirth.

Sian Taylor, 29, tipped the scales at 23st and fitted into size 28 clothes when she gave birth to her second baby Poppy.

Midwives called for emergency help when Poppy’s head came out five minutes before her body, starving her of oxygen.

New woman: Sian Taylor lost 9st 6lb in a year after consultants told her that her newborn's life was put at risk due to her being overweight during pregnancy

Emotional Sian, who has always been overweight and was taunted by bullies at school, said: 'I felt helpless and was in floods of tears.

'All I saw was her lifeless body, and I didn’t know if she was going to survive. I didn’t even have a chance to hold her. I have never been so scared.

'I felt like the worst mother in the world. A mother’s role is to help and protect her child and I could have ended up killing my baby because I was so big.

'I shouldn’t have put her in that situation. The consultant said there were a number of factors why Poppy got stuck, but the biggest reason was most probably because I was overweight.

As she was: Sian Taylor, 29, tipped the scales at 23st and fitted into size 28 clothes when she gave birth to her second baby Poppy

Wake-up call: Sian, pictured with daughters Poppy, 1, and Willow, 2, says that when she saw Poppy's lifeless body during childbirth, it was the wake-up call she needed to lose weight

Lifestyle overhaul: Slimming World consultant Sian started a life-changing diet and joined a gym. She has since dropped from 23st 11lb and a size 28, to 13st 5lb and a size 14

'I also had serious chest pains during my pregnancy which meant I was rushed to hospital for emergency scans of Poppy.'

Though initially the newborn was unable to use her arm she suffered no lasting health issues.

But Sian, of Chandler’s Ford, Hants, was so horrified it was the wake-up call she needed to change her lifestyle and has lost 9st 6lb in less than a year.

Sian was also made redundant from her telesales manager job when she was pregnant with Poppy giving her time to reassess her life and change her future.

At her biggest: Sian said she knew she had hit rock bottom and knew if she didn't act, her babies would no longer have a mummy

New lease on life: Since losing weight, Sian says she enjoys running around the garden with her daughters

Dangerous: Speaking about her previous weight, she said: 'I was killing myself and I was out of control. I can now run around with my children and I even ran Race for Life'

She has swapped calorie-laden food for hearty home-cooked meals, fruit and vegetables, as well as swimming and exercising.

Slimming World consultant Sian, who lives with her fiancé Tim Ndowora, 29, Poppy, one, and Willow, two, said: 'I started a life-changing diet and joined a gym, which I go to regularly. I have dropped from 23st 11lb and a size 28, to 13st 5lb and a size 14.

'I am so much more happy and positive about my life. I’m a totally different person and now have the confidence to do things I wouldn’t have dreamed of doing before.

'I knew I hit rock bottom and I knew if I didn’t act, my babies would no longer have a mummy.

'I was killing myself and I was out of control. I can now run around with my children and I even ran Race for Life.

Old diet: She has swapped calorie-laden food for hearty home-cooked meals, fruit and vegetables, as well as swimming and exercising

'Clothes shopping is getting quite expensive because I am dropping down through the sizes and I have to go shopping quite regularly, but it is a small price to pay.

'It’s amazing how much your life can change in a year. I feel amazing now and for the first time in my life I feel proud of myself. I am actually living rather than just existing.

'My inspiration is my children and hopefully I can be an inspiration for them too.

'I hope to be a size 10-12 when I go wedding dress shopping so Tim and I will set a wedding date when I am closer to that.'
