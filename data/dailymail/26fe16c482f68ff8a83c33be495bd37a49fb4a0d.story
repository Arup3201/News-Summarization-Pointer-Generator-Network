More than 2,000 people displaced by Superstorm Sandy are still living in hotels five months after the devastating natural disaster destroyed their New York City homes.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency is paying on average $252 a night to house families and individuals from across the hurricane hit area.

According to the New York Times, social service groups are hoping to get all those affected into a permanent home by the end of April but admit it may not be possible.

Some experts say such accommodation will put pressure on individuals - leaving them in cramped conditions with no feeling of permanency. Others say it is just too expensive as a long-term solution.

'The problem with hotels is that it’s not a normal life — you can’t cook a meal,' said Martha J. Kegel, executive director of Unity of Greater New Orleans, a coalition that helped relocate residents after Hurricane Katrina, told the Times.

'You can’t even store much food. There’s going to be domestic violence because there’s not enough room. It’s not a good situation for people to be long-term.'

Rosanne Haggerty, president of Community Solutions, a homelessness charity said: 'Why are we spending money on hotels instead of helping families pay the rent?'

'For a fraction of the cost, families could be in a stable situation and getting a running start in putting their lives together.'

Wanda Wilson, a mother-of-two made homeless after Sandy told the paper she hoped for a more permanent solution.

'The whole situation is really messed up. It’s a waste of money,' she said.

Many of those affected by Sandy are too poor to afford available housing and have nowhere to return to because of the devastating impact of the storm.

43 per cent of those who registered for FEMA funding made less than $30,000 per year per household.

The lack of available housing made hotels the only choice according to city officials.

'The hotels provided flexibility and availability that you can’t get anywhere else,' the city’s commissioner of homeless services Seth Diamond said.

It is hoped newly available public housing will plug the gap but in some instances families will also be given vouchers to subsidize 70 per cent of their rent.

If the April 30 target is missed many of the families could end up back in homeless shelters, according to the Times.

'Shelter is one of many possibilities,' said Barbara Brancaccio, a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Homeless Services.

The ongoing difficulties in dealing with the 7,000 residents who went to evacuation centers following Hurricane Sandy on October 29, has prompted many to call for wholesale reform of the city's emergency disaster planning.

'The city may have been overly optimistic,' said Councilman Brad Lander. 'You need to have emergency rental vouchers ready to be deployed.'

After Hurricane Katrina many of those made homeless were put in hotels for years.

And there are many people affected by Sandy who may never get help. 

According to the Times, around two per cent of those in need are illegal immigrants who don't want to reveal their status to officials.

On Friday, the Government announced $1.4billion in aid to New York transit agencies to help rebuild systems after Sandy.
