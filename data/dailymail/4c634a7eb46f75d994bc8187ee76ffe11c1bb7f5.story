Vandals have desecrated the grave of a 13-month-old baby girl, littering it with smashed beer bottles and stomping on toys left by grieving family members.

Police are hunting the culprits who attacked baby Chloe Elliot's grave along with scores of others in a booze-fuelled vandalism spree at Efford cemetery in Plymouth, Devon, on Wednesday night.

Families have branded the attack 'disgraceful, immoral and beyond belief' after finding their loved ones' headstones kicked down, ornaments smashed and flowers torn up as they arrived at the cemetery to pay their respects.

'It's immoral and shows a complete lack of respect for other people,' said Andy Jean, whose mother Marie Jean's grave was severely damaged in the attack.

Mr Jean was visiting the cemetery on what would have been his mum's 80th birthday.

'To do this in a cemetery and knock other people’s gravestones over is beyond belief.'

Russell King, of Newton Ferrers, Devon, found his parents Brenda and David's grave was chipped and strewn with debris.

'It's disgusting,' he said. 'I can't believe it. It's disgraceful. You have to be respectful.'

The vandals left baby Chloe's tiny plot scattered in glass from beer bottles, smashed during the  alcohol-fueled frenzy.

Police said the thugs most likely targeted the graveyard on Wednesday evening, but could have left the trail of destruction in the early hours of Thursday morning.

A spokesman said: 'This is obviously extremely distressing for the families concerned.

'We would very much like to hear from anyone who has information about the incident or witnessed anyone acting suspiciously on that evening in the cemetery.'
