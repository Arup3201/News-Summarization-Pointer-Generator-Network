Mitt Romney yesterday led Republicans in another attack on Barack Obama's foreign policy, criticising the President for describing the murder of the U.S. ambassador to Libya as a mere 'bump in the road'.

The criticism came as Mr Obama once again changed the language he used to describe the attack, which occurred in Benghazi two weeks ago and which he said was 'not just a mob action' when he appeared on The View with his wife Michelle.

The GOP challenger's advisers say the recent unrest in the Middle East has made voters question the President's foreign-policy credentials, an area in which he has until now led Mr Romney thanks to the mission which killed Osama bin Laden last year.

The most devastating incident was the raid on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi on September 11 which killed ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.

Mr Romney was not the only Republican to challenge Mr Obama on foreign policy on Monday.

Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, said: 'Israel continues to find itself on the receiving end of harsh language by the President and the White House.

'There is a somewhat continued pattern of throwing Israel under the bus when Israel stands as our closest ally.'

And the National Republican Senatorial Committee issued challenges to Democratic candidates in several races to 'share their view' on Mr Obama's remarks in an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes over the weekend.

In the interview, Mr Obama was responding when asked if recent events in the Middle East gave him pause for supporting governments that came to power after the Arab Spring.

He said he has long noted that events were going to be rocky, adding that the question itself 'presumes that somehow we could have stopped this wave of change'.

'I think it was absolutely the right thing for us to align ourselves with democracy, universal rights,' he said.

'But I was pretty certain and continue to be pretty certain that there are going to be bumps in the road because, you know, in a lot of these places the one organising principle has been Islam.'

He added: 'There are strains of extremism, and anti-Americans, and anti-Western sentiments and you know can be tapped into by demagogues.'

Mr Romney was eager to talk about the topic, squeezing interviews with three television networks into his schedule and touching on the subject at the beginning of a rally in Pueblo, Colorado.

'I can't imagine saying something like the assassination of ambassadors is a bump in the road, when you look at the entire context, the assassination, the Muslim Brotherhood president being elected in Egypt, 20,000 people killed in Syria, Iran close to becoming a nuclear nation, that these are far from being bumps in the road,' he told ABC.

'They represent events that are spinning out of the kind of influence we'd like to have. We're at the mercy of events rather than shaping the events in the Middle East.'

U.S. officials are investigating the deaths in Libya, which occurred when the consulate was breached.In his appearance on The View, the President avoided a direct answer when asked if the attack had been terrorism.

'There's no doubt that the kind of weapons that were used, the ongoing assault, that it wasn't just a mob action. What's clear is that, around the world, there are still a lot of threats out there,' he said.

Mr Romney intends to return to the subject of international affairs and discuss foreign aid, trade agreements and international development when he addresses the Clinton Global Initiative in New York on Tuesday, according to a source.

The candidate, like Mr Cantor, took a jab at Mr Obama's handling of relations with Israel on Monday.'The president doesn't have time to actually spend time with leaders of these nations, particularly Bibi Netanyahu,' he said. 'I find that very troubling.'
