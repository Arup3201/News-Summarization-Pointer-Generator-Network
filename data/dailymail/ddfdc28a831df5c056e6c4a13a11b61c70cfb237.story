A town mayor who taunted a teenage footballer ‘to take up netball’ after the youngster broke his leg in a match has been fined £35.

Jason Ward was refereeing a youth game when 16-year-old Johnny Adair suffered a shattered tibia in a tackle.

Mr Ward later mocked the Southam United striker – who is also on the books of Birmingham City – in a Facebook message.

Yesterday an FA disciplinary panel found Mr Ward guilty of making inappropriate social network remarks.

Last night Mr Ward, who is mayor of Southam, Warwickshire, said: ‘It was just a bit of banter which has been misinterpreted.  But I accept I was in the wrong.’

Mr Ward had denied both charges but was not required to be present at the committee hearing.

Teenager Johnny was shocked to find a Facebook message sent from councillor Ward’s account the day after he suffered his injury making fun of the incident.

It read: 'Sorry to hear of your "broken" leg, probably happened during the 15th roll, not the challenge!

'It’s only a crack, not a real break. Football is a physical game played by men.

'Maybe think about netball or rounders in future. Get well soon.'

The young footballer said: 'I knew straight away it was a horrendous tackle but

the ref was saying if I’d really broken my leg I’d be crying.

'It’s shocking. A ref shouldn’t behave like that.

'When I found out he was the mayor I couldn’t believe it.

'My main worry is that he’s going to ref other games.'

Yesterday councillor Ward said: 'The FA have found there was no wrongdoing on the pitch and his mother received an apology two days after.

'I was fined for sending the messages on Facebook, which I have accepted. It was just a bit of banter - which has been misinterpreted.

'But I accept I was in the wrong.

'I have paid the fine - and the case it closed now.

'It has not affected my state as councillor or as a referee and I continue to do both.'
