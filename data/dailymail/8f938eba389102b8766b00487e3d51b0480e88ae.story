Pop legend Lulu has been the victim of a frightening cashpoint robbery – a few hundred yards from the Kensington Palace home of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

The 64-year-old singer had her bank card stolen as she was about to withdraw money from a cash machine.

Bravely, the 5ft 1in star chased after the thief, screaming for help.

Distressed: Singer Lulu talks to a police officer just moments after the incident in central London

‘She was stunned for a moment, then she ran after him shouting, “My  card. That man’s got my card,”’ a  witness said.

Lulu had visited the cashpoint at the NatWest on a corner of Kensington High Street – the nearest bank to the Palace in West London – after shopping for groceries at the American health supermarket Whole Foods.

Our exclusive picture shows a clearly distressed Lulu talking to a policeman in her car just minutes after the incident.

She had been distracted by a man who said the cash machine wasn’t working and covered it with a white sticker.

He told her to go inside the bank, 
but suddenly snatched her card, pulled his baseball cap low and ran down
the street to his getaway car, a green Ford – with Lulu in hot pursuit.

The robber jumped into the car in a nearby square and  drove off, the wrong way, down a one-way street.

Lulu, who grew up in Glasgow, called the police and they arrived at the scene within minutes. 

Last
night, a spokesman for the Met said: ‘We were called at 5.30pm on 
February 28 after a woman was the victim of a distraction theft at a 
cashpoint in Kensington High Street

‘The victim had her bank card taken.

'We are investigating but there has been no arrest at this time.’
