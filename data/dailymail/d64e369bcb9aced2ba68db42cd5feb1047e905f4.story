A woman who gained three stone while serving as an officer in the Royal Navy has shed the extra weight in time for her perfect wedding.

Gemma Allardyce, 32, from North Shields, found it a struggle to keep off the weight due to the lively social life and drinking culture that comes with being a sailor. 

Even an active tour of duty in Afghanistan failed to do the trick and she continued to pile on the pounds.

A food-fueled lifestyle saw Naval officer Gemma Allardyce, 32, from North Shields, gain three stone (left). Even a tour of Afghanistan failed to shift weight. But a fear of looking fat at her wedding helped her drop five dress sizes (right). 

'When the opportunity to go to Afghanistan came up, I jumped at the chance' said Gemma adding that she had actually expected to lose weight.

'After all, six and a half months in a war zone where you can't drink and going to the gym was your only form of social interaction, you're bound to come back 'body beautiful' right?'

However, Gemma found that the boozy social life of the Navy left her piling on the pounds.

'The lifestyle in the Navy is a party lifestyle - drinking was massive; drinking and unhealthy food.'

It wasn't until Gemma was shopping for her wedding dress and was forced to settle on a 18 gown that she decided drastic action had to be taken. 

Gemma decided to start dieting a year ago and was able to drop five dress sizes in time for her wedding last summer 

She joined Slimming World and slimmed down to a size eight bride for her nuptials last summer to husband James Allardyce.

Although you need to be fit to be in the Navy, Gemma says that there is no need to be slim and her career left her at a curvy size 18

Gemma, who is planning to leave the Royal Navy in April after 14 years to become a beautician, said her weight would fluctuate from 11 to 13 stone, but claims this isn't uncommon among naval officers.

She said: 'It's the lifestyle in the Navy. There are two chefs on board so you get your five-a-day but there's always unhealthy food around.

She continued: 'You've got to be fit in the Navy but you don't have to be slim.'

The yo-yo dieter did lose weight during her six months in Afghanistan, and became engaged to James on her return, but she had piled it back on by November last year and had to settle on picking out a size 18 wedding dress.

She transformed her diet, replacing junk food and snacks with lean meats and plenty of vegetables. 

Gemma, who has tried numerous fad diets, says that the healthy eating plan was the only diet she has had success at - and the only one James, a scaffolder and also a qualified personal trainer, has approved of.

She said: 'We used to do two separate meals but now there's one for the two of us.

'It's such a big difference to have that time and just sit down at the dining room table at the end of the day and have the same thing.'

She continued: 'The diet has been really easy to do - I felt I was eating more and getting better results.'

By May, when she received a phone call letting her know that her wedding dress was in, she was around 10 stone - but had failed to tell the shop about her dramatic loss.

Staff at the dress shop were stunned at the difference and had quite a job on their hands to re-shape the gown.

Gemma said: 'It was slipping off. They had to pin it all the way down and there were huge flaps down the sides where they had to pin it too.

'They almost took the dress apart and put it back together again.' 

Having dropped a total of 2st 13lb to hit her target weight of 9st 1lb, her new look was revealed to most of her family and friends for the first time at her July wedding.

Gemma is now keen to inspire others to shift the extra pounds

She said: 'I was really excited because I wanted natural pictures taken but in the past I was always having to hold myself in and lift my head up.

'When I saw the pictures there were so many that had been taken when I didn't even know the photographer was there - and I'm smiling and natural looking.' 

And now, a year on from the day she joined the weight-loss club, she's hoping to inspire others by launching her very own Slimming World class in her hometown

Gemma is will be holding her first classes on January 1 and 2, exactly 365 days after she took the plunge herself.
