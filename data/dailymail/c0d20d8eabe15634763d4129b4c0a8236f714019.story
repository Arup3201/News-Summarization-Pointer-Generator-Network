It is perhaps one of the most poignant and heart-wrenching images to come out of Syria after 19 long months of bloody civil war.

The bodies of four innocent young girls, possibly sisters, are wrapped in linen tied with pink bows as they lie among dozens of dead women and children, the latest victims of Bashar Assad's brutal regime.

The girls are believed to be among some 22 civilians slaughtered by the state-sponsored miltia known as the Shabiha in the town of Douma near Damascus yesterday.

'There was a horrible massacre in Douma last night,' the media office of the opposition network in Douma said in a statement.

'More than 20 civilians have been slaughtered by shabiha who were at a checkpoint and then stormed into a residential building nearby.'

Mahmoud Doumany, an activist living in Douma, said that he had the names of 20 of the dead but that 10 were too disfigured to be identified.

'People now are scared and very angry. Some of the martyrs were killed with knives, others were shot,' he said.

Syrian
state television said 25 people had been killed by 'terrorist members 
of the so-called 'Liwa al-Islam.'' State media labels opposition members
as 'terrorists.'

Victims: The bodies of six other civilians allegedly slaughtered in the town of Douma

According to opposition activists militiamen known as shabiha stormed into a residential building and began slaughtering people indiscriminately

The Syrian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the Syrian army was not present in the area.

Opposition video showed images of corpses wrapped in blankets and of the bodies of women and children, one of whom had a hole in his head and another had part of his face missing.

'God is great,' said a man off screen, his voice trembling as he walked around the house, filming bodies on several floors of a residential building.

It was not possible to verify what happened due to Syria's restrictions on media access.

More than 32,000 people have been 
killed in Syria's conflict, which began with peaceful pro-democracy 
protests in March 2011 and escalated into civil war as repression 
increased.

Global and 
regional powers have been unable to stop the violence, with the West 
condemning President Bashar al-Assad but shying away from arming the 
rebels, and Russia, China and Iran sticking by the embattled autocrat.

Syria,
whose leadership comes from the Alawite sect linked to Shi'ite Islam, 
says it is fighting Islamist hardliners backed by Sunni Muslim states 
like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey.

Also
today, an al-Qaida-inspired Islamist group rejected the short holiday 
cease-fire proposed by the international peace envoy to Syria.

The envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, said the government in Damascus and some rebel leaders had agreed to a four-day truce during the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday, which starts Friday.

But in a statement posted on militant websites Jabhat al-Nusra, rejected the cease-fire, calling it a 'filthy game' and saying it has no faith that President Bashar Assad's regime would respect the truce.

The Syrian government says it's studying the proposal.

So far all diplomatic efforts have failed to stop Syria's violence, which activists say has killed more than 34,000 people.

Both sides have agreed to earlier cease-fires only to thwart them with more attacks.

The U.N.-Arab League envoy to Syria 
said the government in Damascus and some rebel leaders have agreed to a 
temporary cease-fire during a four-day Muslim holiday that starts 
Friday.

The
Syrian government, however, did not confirm Wednesday's announcement by
Lakhdar Brahimi, saying only that it was still studying the envoy's 
proposal.

Brahimi told reporters in Cairo that President Bashar Assad's government has agreed to a truce for the Eid al-Adha holiday. Brahimi said Damascus will issue a statement on accepting the cease-fire later 'today or tomorrow.'

The announcement came as government forces intensified airstrikes on a rebel-held area near the besieged city of Aleppo.

The fighting in Syria has killed more than 34,000 people since March last year, according to activists.

Brahimi did not elaborate on how the truce would be monitored. The envoy has met with Assad in Damascus on Sunday as part of his push for a cease-fire between rebels and government forces.

He also held talks last week with opposition groups inside and outside Syria and earlier received 'promises' but not a 'commitment' from them to honor the cease-fire.

In Damascus, Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdessi stressed Wednesday that the cessation of military operations during Eid al-Adha is still 'being studied' by the General Command of the Army and the Syrian armed forces, and that 'the final position on this matter will be issued on Thursday.'

Abdelbaset Sieda, the head of the Syrian National Council, the main opposition group in exile, told The Associated Press that he had little hope the truce would take hold.

He said opposition fighters have told him they are willing to adhere to it, but will respond if attacked by regime forces.

'This regime, we don't trust it, because it is saying something and doing something else on the ground,' Sieda said in a phone interview from Stockholm, Sweden.

Brahimi's proposal is far more modest than a six-point plan by his predecessor as Syrian envoy, former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. A cease-fire was the centerpiece of Annan's proposal and was to lead to talks on a peaceful transition.

However, a truce never took hold and both sides violated their commitments, though Annan said at the time the regime was the main aggressor because it refused to withdraw troops and heavy weapons from population centers.

In Syria, regime warplanes struck the village of Mar Shureen near a strategic rebel-held town in the country's north Wednesday, killing five members of an extended family, activists said.

The village is located just outside the town of Maaret al-Numan, about a mile (1.5 kilometer) from a Syrian military camp that troops and rebels have been fighting over for several days.

Rami Abdul-Rahman, the director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told The AP that government aircraft hit the village in the morning hours.

The dead include a father and his two sons, aged 10 and 24, as well as a two other relatives, a woman and a young man, Abdul-Rahman said. His group relies on reports from a network of activists on the ground.

Opposition fighters seized Maaret al-Numan, which lies along the main highway between Aleppo and Damascus, earlier this month, disrupting the ability of Assad's army to send supplies and reinforcements to the northwest where troops are bogged down in a stalemate with the rebels in Aleppo, Syria's largest city.

At least 10 people were killed and 13 were injured when an artillery shell landed near a bakery in Aleppo, Abdul-Rahman said.

Amateur video posted Tuesday showed stacks of pita bread on shelves, soaked in blood, and human remains scattered on the floor.

Residents are also seen carrying injured people, some missing limbs, out of a shop that appears to be a bakery, loading them into civilian cars as a man shouts: 'May God punish you, Bashar ... He is bombing the people at the bakery. '

Syria restricts access to foreign reporters and the authenticity of the video could not be independently confirmed.
