The contest, organised by the Mammal Society, aimed to encourage appreciation for the many British species which are often overlooked but essential to the health of our habitats.

International photography judge Sophie Stafford said: 'Every year, the Mammal Society photo competition gets stronger and stronger.

'This year, we were treated to an impressive collection of eye-catching portraits, evocative scenes and thrilling behaviour, which just prove that the most beautiful and exciting mammals in the world live on our doorsteps.

'It was wonderful to see so many challenging species and creative photographic techniques tackled by entrants. Everyone who made it through to the judges' shortlist should be very proud.'

The winning picture was taken by Maurice Flynn, 46, from Waterford City, Ireland, who used a camera trap and sat up all night waiting for the pine marten to appear. 

Mr Flynn said: 'The picture I wanted to get was of them jumping or moving through the trees. They never came out in daylight so it had to be done at night.'  

Wildlife garden expert Kate MacRae, who helped judge the contest, said it was a 'cracking image.'

She added: 'Most of us would be thrilled with a static picture of a pine marten, but the technical expertise and dedication to capture a perfectly exposed camera trap image such as this, is impressive. A cracking image that is testament to the dedication of the photographer.'

Ms MacRae said: 'This image stood out straight away. Beautifully composed, the silhouette of the slender doe stands framed by the ground and the foliage overhead.

'A difficult shot to expose correctly, this image captures the golden sunset perfectly and that moment when the deer paused listening. A super atmospheric and well composed image.'

Also making the judges' shortlist were photos of some of Britain's smallest mammals, including harvest mice, water shrews and wood mice.

The winning and commended photos will be on show to the public at The Mammal Society Spring Conference at Lancaster University on March 27. They will then be auctioned to support The Mammal Society.
