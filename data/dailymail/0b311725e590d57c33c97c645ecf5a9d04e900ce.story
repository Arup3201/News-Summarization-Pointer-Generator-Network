Former England footballer Michael Owen has been inundated with critical messages after starring in a 'sexist' new car ad.

In the ad, which was made on behalf of his local car dealership, Owen, who is married to childhood sweetheart Louise Bonsall, compares women to luxury cars and goes on to boast about the 'dozens' of Jaguars he owns.

 'You've got to go for looks to start with,' said the star in the clip, before adding: 'Then you look inside. It's probably similar to girls isn't it? 

Awkward! In the new advert former footballer Michael Owen compares women to luxury cars 

'The look attracts you to start with and then you get to know them a bit more, I think it's the same with cars.'

Andrew North, a director at Alexanders Prestige, the dealership behind the ad, defended Owen's statement when contacted by MailOnline.

'I think it's a fair comparison,' said Mr North. 'You are attracted to the outside but ultimately, it's what's on the inside that counts and that's what he was trying to say.

'We actually filmed three hours of footage so that was just a very small part of it.'

The cringe-making video, which is set to a classical soundtrack, begins with Owen, 34, standing in the middle of the garage surveying the cars around him.

During the two-minute ad, he goes on to make several more gasp-worthy claims.

What a stunner: Michael films in front of his new Range Rover, hopefully Alexanders Prestige offered him some sort of a discount

'I've owned quite a variety of cars over the years,' he says. 'My first car being a Rover coupe, [I then] progressed to a BMW, Aston Martin, Ferrari and Range Rovers. It's great to come back home so to speak.

'I had a deal with Jaguar for a long time as well, so probably had a dozen Jaguars and a few others.' 

He continued: 'You know, you grow with cars I was never going to get a Ferrari at 18 or something. You wait until you've earned your stripes so to speak.'

Owen - who was once reported to have a net worth of £40million - was clearly unaware that for most, the stumbling block to Jaguar ownership is not being too young but being unable to afford the £170,000 price tag.  

Not content with that, Owen added: 'In football there is a hierarchy so if you go in with a nicer car than someone who has played a 100 games and played for his country then you'll be quickly slapped down and told to sell it.

Alan Patridge? Many have compared former England star Michael's punditry to the fictional character Alan Partridge

'You have to grow your car organically as I say with how you're doing on the football pitch.'

Defending his star, Mr North added: 'Michael was a pleasure to work with. We have known him for years and he have previously worked with him and his family through the equestrian side of the business.

'He was very happy to take part in the advert and we will be working with him again.' 

'I met the chaps Andy and Alex [of Alexanders Prestige],' added Owen, 'and we've done a bit of business in the horsey world as well and obviously they picked a really nice one for me.

'I've driven Range Rovers before but it's probably eight, 10 years ago so the new model is lovely and I can't wait to put some miles on it.'

When he's not promoting car dealerships, Owen - who during his career enjoyed stints at Liverpool, Real Madrid and Manchester United - works as a footballing pundit but has seen his efforts compared to Alan Partridge.
