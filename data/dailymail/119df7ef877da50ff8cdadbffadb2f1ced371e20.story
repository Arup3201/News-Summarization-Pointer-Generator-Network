Depending on why you buy things, materialism may actually increase your sense of loneliness

Many of us know the comfort of turning to a little retail therapy when we feel down or lonely.

But while treating ourselves to something nice may improve our mood briefly, new research from the University of Chicago suggests that shopping as a cure for loneliness is futile - and could in fact make us feel more lonely.

In fact, the very act of fending off loneliness by shopping can create a vicious cycle where one shops because they are lonely, feels more lonely because they have shopped, and continues shopping in a misguided attempt to cure the loneliness.

The study, published in the Journal of Consumer Research, analysed data from 2,500 consumers over six years and found that while loneliness does indeed contribute to materialism, the two have a bidirectional relationship.

Defining materialism as the ‘importance consumers attach to acquiring and owning material possessions’ the study proposes that materialism can ‘crowd out’ social relationships and thus increase loneliness, which in turn increases materialism as a coping strategy.

Before you throw out your credit card though, it is worth noting that the researchers found this vicious cycle only applied to two of the three sub-types of materialism: ‘Acquisition as source of happiness’ (where material possessions are a means to your happiness; you buy things in an attempt to fill an inner void of happiness) and ‘possession-defined success’ (using material things as a yardstick to measure how well you’re doing in life in comparison to other people) both increased loneliness over time.

However the third type of materialism ‘acquisition centrality’ (buying nice or luxury things simply because owning them makes you happy) in fact decreased loneliness.

Similarly, while being lonely increased both the first two types of materialism, it had no effect on acquisition centrality.

The subtype of materialism 'acquisition centrality' can actually decrease your sense of loneliness- so just make sure you are shopping for the right reasons!

If buying a new designer dress makes us happy because it's beautiful and we enjoyed choosing it, for instance, then the purchase may have the effect of making us feel somewhat less lonely.

However
if we expect the dress to cure an inner sense of unhappiness, or 
we want it to show friends and colleagues how well we are doing, then buying it may 
ultimately lead to us feeling more lost and lonely than before the shopping trip.

So while the study points at a wisdom in evaluating why we shop, it does not necessarily mean that we are all susceptible to the same pernicious cycle of materialism and loneliness.
