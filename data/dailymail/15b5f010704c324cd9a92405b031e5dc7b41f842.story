Fraud: Benefit cheat Caroline Hartshorn, who claimed benefits, claiming she could barely walk due to arthritis, was working as a children's entertainer

A benefits cheat who claimed she could barely walk due to crippling arthritis was caught working - as a children's entertainer at a holiday park.

Greedy Caroline Hartshorn, 38, claimed more than £5,000 of taxpayers' money in disability allowances on the basis she needed full-time personal care.

But the married mum-of-two from Skegness, Lincolnshire, was exposed as a fraud after investigators found she working at a holiday park - as well as three other jobs.

She worked as a children's entertainer at The Tavern pub at Mablethorpe Chalet Park during the summer of 2011 and spring of 2012.

Between April and June 2011 Hartshorn also worked as a caravan sales assistant, a care assistant and a market manageress.

Skegness Magistrates Court heard the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) received an anonymous tip off.

The court was told she was overpaid £5,140.35 in Disability Living Allowance between December 2010 and August 2012.

Hartshorn, from Skegness, admitted two charges of failing to notify change of circumstances when she appeared at court last Wednesday.

JP's gave her a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered her to pay £100 in costs.

The court heard Hartshorn was born with arthritis and began to claim for her condition in August 1992 with a care element added from 1995.

In 2009 Hartshorn filled in a self-assessment form on which said she could only walk ten yards at a time and needed personal care.

But in May 2011 an anonymous allegation was made against Hartshorn which led to a six-week surveillance exercise by authorities which found the evidence which contradicted her self-assessment.

But Dave Clapham, defending, said 
Hartshorn believed she had informed the DWP her condition had improved 
following a knee operation.

Hartshorn worked as a children's entertainer at Mablethorpe Chalet Park during the summer of 2011 and spring of 2012

He said: 'She was born with a condition of arthritis in her joints, a knee operation did alleviate some of the problems with that but there was a part where she could do nothing at all.

'Whilst she could perhaps get about a little there wasn't a diminishment in the pain.

'It's not dishonesty from the start, all of this work has been very short term. She should have notified the authorities, in fact she believed she had.

'The businesses she does run are from home.'

Hartshorn refused to comment outside court.
