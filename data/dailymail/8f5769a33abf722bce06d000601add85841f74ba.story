Jessie J has fast become the queen of the 'Gelfie' - that's gym selfie to you and I - regularly posting snaps of her intense work-outs.

And it seems that Nike took notice - the sports brand has invited Jessie J to be the star of its app, Nike + Training Club High Intensity Training Workout.

The pop star will guide users through five drills that aim to build muscular endurance - one of which, the 'Jessie drop squat' - is inspired by what the performer does to warm up before going on stage.

Fitness fanatic: Singer Jessie J, who has made no secret of her passion for exercise, has joined forces with Nike to help out with its fitness app

Speaking about the new collaboration, Jessie said: 'With the app, I feel like I can do the workout and I can sweat and feel tired and what’s great is that my fans can join in too and get a taste of how I train. That’s cool.'

In between recording, training and performing, Jessie J took some time to chat about her art, energy and training schedule.

The 25-year-old, who flew out to Los Angeles on 
Saturday to spend time with her American fan base and work on the US version of her album Alive, shared her inspirations and secrets to success.

'Inspiration for me comes from everywhere,' she said.

'I try to exaggerate moments of life that provoke emotions, so I get inspiration from my family, my fans, from music, from food, from a feeling in my tummy. Everything. Everything’s different, but everything to me is inspiration.'

Speaking about her energy and determination to live out her dreams, the star said: 'For me, it’s a matter of choice.

Wise words: Jessie J says it's important to enjoy the life you've been given, use that as great energy and 'dedicate your time to what you want your life to be'

'When you wake up in the morning, you have a choice in life.

'You either procrastinate and you sit back and let your dreams go by, or you enjoy the life you’ve been given, use that as great energy and dedicate your time to what you want your life to be.

'I was brought up with that mindset and it’s never left me. So I’m very grateful for that; it's the reason I try and enjoy everything I do.'

Jessie, who recently announced she will not be supporting Robin Thicke on his USA tour in order to prioritise her music, revealed her secrets to staying in shape.

'Dedication is the first word that springs to mind because you really do have to allocate time to working out.

'All you consist of in life is your body and I’m five-foot-nine of me. So I have to make sure that from my head to my toes, I’m doing the best I can to make my life long and healthy.

'I eat well, I try to get as much rest as I can, and I push myself on stage and in my cardio training.'

Clearly her hard work is paying off; the singer was spotted looking radiant and trim as she headed out to a number of business meetings in the Big Apple's 
Soho district this week.

Devoted: Jessie has been dedicating plenty of 
time to her American fan-base in recent months, after jetting out to Los
 Angeles in January to spend time with her American 'Heartbeats'

The Jessie J Wild Alive High Intensity Workout will launch on the N+TC App on March 3. For more information about the N+TC App or to shop Jessie J’s look, visit Nike.com  .
