Scotland Yard detectives flew in to Portugal last night ahead of excavation at the holiday resort where Madeleine McCann vanished.

But the arrival of the team, led by Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, comes as tensions with the Portuguese authorities escalated, with fears the investigation could be derailed at any point.

After almost two years of delicate negotiations, Scotland Yard has been given permission to start digging at sites surrounding the holiday resort in Praia da Luz where the youngster disappeared seven years ago.

Madeleine, who would be ten on 12 May, was three when she vanished from her holiday flat on May 3, 2007

A large wasteland yards from the Ocean Club complex will be dug up, 
plus an area beside the beach as well as roads by the church in Praia da
 Luz where Gerry and Kate McCann prayed for the safe return of their 
daughter.

But while Met 
detectives instigated the new searches and will cover the huge costs 
involved, the work is controlled by the Portuguese.

There are even concerns that the Met may be banned from ‘witnessing’ the digs.

In
 a further setback, a request to search the homes of some of the prime 
suspects in the case has been rejected. The three former staff members 
at the Ocean Club are considered ‘people of interest’ by the inquiry.

Analysis
 of mobile phone data suggests the men were close to the scene of her 
abduction and were in contact in the hours that  followed.

One
 theory is that burglars raided the McCanns’ flat and were panicked into
 snatching Maddie when she woke up. Met detectives reportedly requested 
the men’s bank details and asked local officers to quiz the trio and 
search their homes.

But the judge who dealt with the requests ‘did not consider Scotland Yard’s arguments valid’, local sources said.

Abroad: Specialist search teams will start by scouring sites across Praia da Luz - including this waste ground near the Ocean Club apartment complex

The digs are not thought to necessarily be in connection with a search for the youngster's body or remains

This land that was not fenced at the time of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann is contiguous to the path where witnesses saw a man passing with a child in pyjamas in her arms the night of the disappearance

The
 Met team is part of Operation Grange, which was set up in 2011 to 
investigate the disappearance of Maddie, whose 11th birthday is on 
Monday.

British detectives have since expressed their growing frustration at the length of time the probe is taking.

The Mail told yesterday how a large 
wasteland yards from the complex will be dug up, as well as an area 
beside the beach and roads by the church in Praia da Luz where Gerry and
 Kate McCann prayed for the safe return of their daughter.

But
 while Met detectives instigated the new searches and will pay for them,
 they may only be allowed to watch while the work is controlled by the 
Portuguese.

In a further 
set-back, officers have been told a request to search the homes of 
suspects who worked at the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz has been 
rejected.

The stand-off has come after the Met set up Operation Grange in 2011 to investigate the toddler’s disappearance.

Portuguese
 authorities refused to mount a joint investigation, preventing Scotland
 Yard from carrying out its own activities in Portugal, and a number of 
requests have since been snubbed.

In
 a letter to the media yesterday, Met Police assistant commissioner 
Mark Rowley suggested the relationship between the forces was on a knife
 edge.

He warned officers 
could not keep the public up to date with information in case it upsets 
Portuguese authorities. ‘The advice I am receiving from Portugal is that
 their approach is very different,’ he said.

‘If
 we provide any briefings or information on the work they are 
undertaking on our behalf activity will cease until that problem 
dissipates.

‘We will not be able to provide any information concerning the activity because ultimately it could mean the work stops.’

Deputy
 assistant commissioner Martin Hewitt added: ‘We have been issuing a 
number of letters of request. Some of the requests are not being acceded
 to.

‘It’s not fatal to 
what we are going to do - it’s their judicial authority.’ He said they 
were not being refused because of any lack of resources.

‘That’s
 causing us frustration because we know what we want to do and we are 
ready to go with that. But the process is the process,’ he added.

Maddie disappeared on May 3, 2007, when she was three years old. Her 11th birthday is next week.

The
 cold case review into her disappearance has involved the painstakingly 
analysis of every document collected during the multi-million pound 
inquiry.

Appeals on BBC’s 
Crimewatch led to new information and officers now plan to dig up key 
areas of Praia da Luz, just yards from where she vanished.

A
 key area to be searched is an overgrown wasteland, which was bought by 
Irish developers before being abandoned because of a property crisis in 
the area.

Metropolitan
 Police’s Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowler has blamed the Portuguese 
authorities for the lack of information being made public by Operation 
Grange.

In an open letter 
dated today, the senior police officer said that despite pleas for the 
media to be briefed on ongoing developments in the search for Madeline 
McCann, Portugal’s Policia Judiciara have threatened to stop work if 
information is passed on.

Revealing
 the ongoing tension between British and Portuguese police, Assistant 
Commissioner Rowley said he had explained to his opposite number in the 
Policia Judiciara that it is the Met’s preferred practice to make public
 as much information and context as possible, providing it does not 
compromise the investigation.

He
 revealed that the reply from the Portuguese police was that they do not
 brief the media on an ongoing investigation, accompanied by a threat 
that if any information were to emerge, the work undertaken by Portugal 
on behalf of Scotland Yard would ‘cease until that problem dissipates’.

‘It
 is important you understand this and appreciate the position in which I
 find myself. We will not be able to provide any information concerning 
the activity because ultimately it could mean the work stops,’ Assistant
 Commissioner Rowley said.

‘We
 respect the Portuguese position as we would expect them to respect our 
position if we were carrying out work on their behalf in the UK,’ he 
added.

Portuguese 
detectives will use radar equipment and mechanical diggers to excavate 
the site, while officers on foot will conduct fingertip searches.

Local
 reports suggested cadaver dogs could also be used in the searches - a 
controversial development considering the flawed initial Portuguese 
police case against the McCanns relied on evidence from two British 
sniffer dogs.

Also targeted 
will be an area by the beach, two locations in the surrounding 
countryside and land near Our Lady of the Light Church in Praia da Luz, 
where Gerry and Kate were given keys to pray alone after Maddie 
disappeared.

Met officers - who will pay for the work - will be in the area but can, at best, only supervise.

There
 are even concerns they may be banned from ‘witnessing’ the digs, with 
decisions on the details involved due to be made imminently by 
Portuguese authorities.

Respected
 Portuguese newspaper Jornal de Noticias wrote: ‘The logistics necessary
 for the execution of all this work will be costly.

‘It will be paid for by the UK which has already spent nearly seven million euros on this investigation.’

After
 26 trips to Portugal to negotiate the work, British detectives have 
also been told they will not be allowed to raid the homes of three key 
suspects who worked at the Ocean Club when Maddie disappeared.

And, as none of the suspects is British, the Met does not have jurisdiction to make arrests.

The
 three former staff members, who are thought to have carried out 
break-ins at the resort, are considered ‘people of interest’ in the 
inquiry.

Analysis of mobile 
phone data suggests the men were close to the scene of her abduction and
 were in contact in the hours that followed.

One theory is that the burglars raided the McCanns’ flat and were panicked into snatching the youngster when she woke up.

Portuguese police initially searched the resort, but the Met will look for anything they might have missed

Met detectives reportedly requested the men’s bank details and asked local officers to quiz the trio and search their homes.

But the judge who dealt with the requests ‘did not consider Scotland Yard’s arguments valid,’ local sources said.

A
 spokesman for the Attorney General’s Office in Portugal said: ‘The 
content of the requests formulated by the British authorities is 
confidential.’

British 
police are said ‘discreetly’ to be on the ground in Portugal already, 
with a full team is expected to arrive in the coming days.

The Met Police said it was not prepared to provide a ‘running commentary’ on the inquiry.
