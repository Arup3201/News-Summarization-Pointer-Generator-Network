Those thick mahogany locks that never frizz, kink or wisp have, unsurprisingly, become her trademark.

And with a personal hair-stylist by her side at all times, it's even less surprising that the Duchess of Cambridge's hair has become the envy of women all over the world.

In fact, the 'cascading locks' of the former Kate Middleton has been voted the celebrity hair other women would most like to have, followed closely by the wavy blonde 'elegant and effortless' tresses of Mick Jagger's ex-wife Jerry Hall, and the shiny 'big bouffant' of singer Cheryl Cole.

Model and presenter Kelly Brook, Spice Girl Victoria Beckham and new mum Adele also made it into the top five, while Holly Willoughby just missed out.

The survey, conducted by professional hair product retailer, Fabriah.com, polled 700 of the site's female users and asked them which celebrity hair they would most like to have.

Model and Strictly Come Dance in star Jerry Hall came second on the list. with just under a fifth of respondents coveting her blonde locks.

Cheryl Cole managed to come third in the poll, closely followed by glamour model Kelly Brooke who came in fourth.

One in ten people named both Victoria Beckham's and Adele's hair as the most desirable, bringing them in joint fifth place.

In a surprise turn of events, Holly Willoughby failed to make the top five and, by polling eight per cent of the vote, came in sixth.

In seventh and eighth place were X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger and US First Lady Michelle Obama, who scored seven and five per cent respectively.

In last place came reality TV star Charlotte Crosby from Geordie Shore, who only just scored four per cent of the public vote.

One respondent who took part in the 
survey said: 'I absolutely love Kate Middleton's hair - it 
is a timeless style which just radiates sophistication.

'The 
other thing about Kate’s hair is that it always looks so natural - not 
like some of the bleached and backcombed starlets you see gracing the 
television these days.'

Another commented: 'I have always loved Jerry Hall’s hair, it just has 
that elegant but effortless quality about it.'

Fabriah.com spokesperson Francesca Davies commented: 'Whether it’s Kate's cascading locks or Cheryl Cole's big bouffant, we all want to have that celebrity look.

'It was interesting to see Jerry Hall come so highly on the list - it seems that even after thirty years women still want her iconic look. What's more it is really great to see an older woman as a style icon.

'I was surprised to see favourites such as Victoria Beckham and Holly Willoughby poll comparatively low on the list.

'It just goes to show there is a difference between what celeb hair women like and what hair they actually want.'
