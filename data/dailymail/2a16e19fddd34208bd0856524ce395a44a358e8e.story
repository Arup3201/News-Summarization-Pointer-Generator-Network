Life on the open road may seem appealing – if you can bring creature comforts with you.

A Swiss company aims to save travellers the inconvenience of booking a hotel, or getting wet in a tent while sleeping on the ground, with a kit that converts any car into a miniature home.

The Swiss Room Box is modelled on a Swiss army knife and includes everything needed for a comfortable camping trip, including a double bed, table, chairs and camping stove.

The kit folds up to the size of a suitcase in order to fit inside the boot of a car and can be unfurled in five minutes to transform a vehicle into a place to sleep, cook and eat, it claims.

The main base of the all-in-one device is placed in the boot of the car, while the front of the bed is supported by a built-in suspension system.

Similar to a Lego design, the device clips together without the need for tools and allows the bed to be levelled to ensure a good – and even – night’s sleep.

A fold-out table and camping stove can be extended to extend out from a car’s boot, giving campers an el-fresco dining room and kitchen.

The box of tricks  measures 39 inches (1 metre) long, 19 inches (49cm) wide and 5 inches (12cm) thick.

A spokesman for Swiss Room Box said: ‘Over 100 years ago, the invention of The Swiss Knife was transforming a basic knife into a multi-functioning tool.

‘Today, another Swiss company has created the Swiss Room Box that will transform your car into a multi-functional home on-board.

‘Thanks to an ingenious modular system installed in the boot of your car, you can cook, eat, take a shower and sleep during your outdoor adventures.’

The Swiss Room Box is equipped with handles and integrated wheels to allow it to be moved easily. It can be checked in as luggage on most airlines, too.

Prices range from €1,799 (£1,416) for the most basic version, up to €5,810, (£4,573) which includes a sink, shower, kitchen equipment, and electrics for lights and charging.
