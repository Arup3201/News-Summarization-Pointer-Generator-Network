Pele has exchanged semi-intensive care for his own living quarters as his condition continues to improve following a urinary tract infection.

Brazil's three-time World Cup winner, now 74, has been treated at the Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo since November 24, after being diagnosed with an infection that stemmed from an operation to remove kidney stones.

He has only one kidney, having had one removed towards the end of his playing career.

The former striker was in such good health and positive spirits on Friday that he posted a video on Facebook that showed him playing guitar and he has now been able to escape regular observation and move into his own room.

A statement from the hospital, signed by doctors Fabio Nasri and Marcelo Costa Batista, and the hospital's superintendent Dr Miguel Cendoroglo Neto, read: 'Patient Edson Arantes do Nascimento (Pele) continues to do well, has no fever, and is still taking a course of antibiotics.

'As scheduled, he was transferred to his own apartment today (Saturday).'

In his video appearance on Friday, the former Santos star said: 'Don't worry. Thank you very much. I know everybody (is) worried about my health but I am okay.'

He added: 'Thanks God and thanks everyone who always pray for me.'
