A father has been charged with capital murder in the death of his son who died after being inside their washing machine. 

Authorities will not comment on whether Joseph Blocker, 28, put his son, Koda Blocker, inside the washing machine or if the boy had climbed inside himself, but they did say it is a front loading machine that must be closed and switched on from the outside before starting a cycle.

Around 3.30pm on Tuesday, Blocker called 911 to report that the boy was unconscious at their home in Garland, Texas. Only he, Koda and his 22-month-old daughter were home at the time.

Locked up: Joseph Blocker, 28, has been charged with capital murder after his four-year-old son died after being in their washing machine. It is not yet clear if the father put the boy in or if he climbed inside

Authorities arrived and found the boy already dead. 

Detectives said that a medical examiner found the boy's injuries consistent with him being inside a washing machine.

'What we feel is at some point the child was inside the washing machine in the home,' Garland police Officer Joe Harn said.

'According to investigators it is a front-loading type. For the child to be in the machine, the door had to be shut and it had to be started from the outside. It does not start by automatically shutting the door.'

He would not comment on what role the father is believed to have played in the boy's injuries, but pointed out only he, the four-year-old boy and his 22-month-old daughter were home at the time.

The boy's exact cause of death is under investigation. Police detectives are working with the Dallas County Medical Examiner's Office to determine the cause of death, Harn said.

Blocker, who lives with his children and a woman at the address, was arrested at the scene.

Neighbor Yesenia Varela told CBS he was there when Blocker was taken into custody on Tuesday.

'He had no expression on his face,' she said. 'I don't know what to tell you. He had no expression.'

Another neighbor, Luz Juarez, said Blocker's hands appeared to be streaked with blood. 

Blocker was taken to the Garland Detention Center on the murder charge. His bond has been set at $500,000.

According to public records, Blocker pleaded guilty to marijuana possession in 2005 and was convicted on a DWI charge in 2013.

The boy's mother was out of state at the time, WFAA reported. The little girl is now in her care.
