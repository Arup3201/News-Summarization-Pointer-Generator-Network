David Cameron’s spin doctor was yesterday accused of threatening a newspaper planning to expose details of a Cabinet minister’s expenses.

Craig Oliver, the Prime Minister’s director of communications, contacted the Daily Telegraph when he learned it was preparing to reveal that Culture Secretary Maria Miller’s parents lived in her taxpayer-funded second home.

Mr Oliver telephoned the newspaper’s editor last Friday and allegedly suggested that any such story would be ill-timed when the issue of press regulation was being discussed.

The newspaper claimed he indicated that the article may be poorly timed as ‘she [Mrs Miller] is looking at Leveson at the moment’.

This was a reference to the aftermath of the Leveson inquiry into Press standards. He also said she was considering making a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission.

Mrs Miller is in charge of implementing Lord Justice Leveson’s report, which proposes statutory underpinning for a new press complaints body.

Joanna Hindley, a special adviser to Mrs Miller, also brought up the Leveson report, it is claimed, allegedly telling the paper she wanted to ‘flag up’ the fact that her boss was involved in implementing it.The minister claims the newspaper harassed her elderly father, and she was angry that he was quoted in the paper. 

Last night Downing Street issued a rebuttal, saying it was ‘ridiculous’ to suggest that Mr Oliver had threatened the Telegraph’s editor, Tony Gallagher.

Downing Street communications boss Craig Oliver was one of the advisers who called the newspaper to 'flag up' Ms Miller's role in regulating the press

But the interventions by Mr Oliver 
and Miss Hindley come at a time of widespread concern about politicians 
being given a role in overseeing the regulation of the press.

Shocked MPs said they looked like an 
attempt to threaten the paper with tougher regulation if it went ahead 
with the expenses story.

Last night Mrs Miller faced calls to remove herself from any involvement in the Government’s response to Leveson.

The editor of The Times newspaper has resigned.

James
Harding, 43, announced he was quitting after the owners - Rupert 
Murdoch’s News Corp – made clear they wanted a new editor.

The
move comes at a time when Mr Harding, one of the youngest journalists 
ever to take charge of the paper, was heavily involved in the newspaper 
industry’s response to the Leveson Inquiry.

Mr
Harding, who has been in charge of the paper for five years, said: ‘It 
has been made clear to me that News Corporation would like to appoint a 
new editor of the Times. I have, therefore, agreed to stand down.

'I called Rupert this morning to offer my resignation and he accepted it.

‘I will be leaving at the end of the year and a new editor will be appointed in due course.'

The national independent directors of The Times will be now be consulted on a replacement, a company spokesman said.

In
Mr Harding’s leaving speech he said: 'This paper has an unrivalled 
history and, I am extremely confident, a long and impressive future 
ahead of it.

'It
is also something else: a wonderful place to work, full of smart, warm,
extraordinary people. I will miss it, but most of all you.'

Mr Harding began his journalistic career at the Financial Times after studying at Cambridge University.

Miss Hindley, 29, flatly denied that 
her words were intended as a threat, and claimed it was ‘misleading’ to 
‘suggest it is anything to do with Leveson’, and Downing Street backed 
the aide.

A spokesman for Number Ten said: ‘For
the Daily Telegraph to suggest that Craig Oliver was threatening them 
at any time is beyond absurd. Maria Miller had had a day of dealing with
her elderly father, who was very upset.

‘Mr Oliver phoned Tony Gallagher to discuss the story, who then sent through an apology for any distress that had been caused.

‘The conversation was about Maria 
Miller being very upset at a time when she was extremely busy with a 
whole load of things, including Leveson. 

‘The suggestion, made five days after
the conversation, that that was some kind of threat is completely 
ridiculous.’ The row began when the Telegraph, which broke the expenses 
scandal in 2009, investigated Mrs Miller for billing the taxpayer 
£90,000 for a second home where her parents lived.

She has been claiming the cost of the
mortgage and other expenses associated with the large property in South
London. The taxpayer is liable for this because Mrs Miller claims that 
for five years her main home has been a rented property in her 
Basingstoke constituency.

Her arrangements appeared to be at 
odds with parliamentary rules. In 2009, Tony McNulty, the Labour Home 
Office minister, was severely reprimanded for letting his parents live 
in his taxpayer-funded second home.

The Telegraph  sent reporters to the 
address to check if Mrs Miller’s parents lived there, where they are 
said to have held a  ‘brief conversation’ with Mrs Miller’s father. It 
formally approached her office about the second home last Thursday.

A reporter spoke to Miss Hindley, and
she pointed out that the Telegraph’s editor was involved in meetings 
with the Prime Minister and the Culture Secretary over implementing the 
recommendations made by Lord Justice Leveson.

According to the Telegraph, she said:
‘Maria has obviously been having quite a lot of editors’ meetings 
around Leveson at the moment. So I am just going to kind of flag up that
connection for you to think about.’

Yesterday, neither Miss Hindley nor her department denied she used these words. 

Douglas Carswell, Conservative MP for
Clacton, said: ‘I don’t want to live in a country where politicians’ 
representatives are able to stop newspapers from holding politicians to 
account.
‘If we become that sort of country then we will be a tin pot country.’

John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, 
said: ‘This is the kind of thing you would expect in a Stalinist 
dictatorship. It has no place in British democracy.

But the Prime Minister’s official 
spokesman said: ‘My understanding is that she [Miss Hindley] was raising
legitimate concerns about the way in which the investigation had been 
handled. It was perfectly reasonable for her to do that.’
