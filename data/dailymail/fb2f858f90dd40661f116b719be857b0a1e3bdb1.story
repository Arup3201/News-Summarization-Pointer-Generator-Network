Police have released footage showing the dramatic moment a mother was freed from the trunk of a car after she was kidnapped by her son - because he was 'lonely'.

Regelio Lopez, 20, allegedly kidnapped his mother 
from their home in Richmond, Virginia and forced her into the trunk of his Cadillac last month because she would not move with him to Miami.

Authorities in South Carolina caught up with Lopez on February 25 after receiving reports that his car was involved in an alleged kidnapping.

Discovery: Inside was the driver's mother who he'd allegedly kidnapped because he was lonely in Florida

The dashboard camera footage, first released to WWBT, shows the troopers following Lopez's car into a rest area of I-95 near Santee lot and ordering him out of the vehicle and to the ground.

One of the troopers then approaches the trunk with caution and opens it to find the woman inside. He helps her to her feet and leads her away from the car.

In the video, a trooper asks Lopez: 'What made you do that?'

'I was alone,' Lopez responds.

His mother was taken to a local hospital as a precaution but was not seriously hurt.

Arrested: Regelio Lopez, 20, said his mother had tried to escape when he stopped to buy her food from a Dairy Queen, so he punched her in the ribs and shoved her in the car trunk, police said

During the trip, Lopez had stopped to get her food from a Dairy Queen and she had tried to escape, authorities said.

On
 the dashcam footage, which was released by the South Carolina 
Department of Safety, he admits to hitting her in the ribs and forcing 
her to get in the trunk.

But
 he insisted that he did not kidnap his mother and had returned from 
Florida, where he was working, simply to collect her and take her there 
too.

Lopez was jailed in Richmond on kidnapping charges.
