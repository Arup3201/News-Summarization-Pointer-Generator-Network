A mother-of-two nearly died after developing blood poisoning just days after giving birth to her second child.

Samantha Cousans, from Sheffield in South Yorkshire, was placed in a coma, her life hanging in the balance as sepsis ravaged her body causing the flesh in her legs to die.

For 11 days the mother-of two, who had yet to meet her newborn daughter Megan Rose, fought the vicious condition.

When she finally woke, Mrs Cousans was left paralysed after losing muscle function while lying in the medically induced coma. 

Today, against the odds, Mrs Cousans has made a full recovery, and is now enjoying looking after her two daughters, Olivia, five and Megan now 18 months. 

Samantha Cousans, 31, from Sheffield was struck down with life-threatening blood poisoning just days after giving birth to baby Megan Rose, now 18 months

The blood poisoning surging through her body caused necrosis - where the body's flesh dies due to lack of oxygen reaching the tissue

She was also left paralysed because her muscles wasted away from being in a coma for so long 

Mrs Cousans said: 'After giving birth to Megan I was so excited to be at home, Olivia was so happy to have a baby sister and it should have been a wonderful time.

'But within days my health deteriorate rapidly.

'I felt sick all the time and was so weak - I couldn't even hold Megan as she felt so heavy in my arms.

'When I eventually went to hospital my family were told I might not make it through the night, it was that serious.

'When I came around after my coma I couldn't believe what was happening to me - and being paralysed was very scary.

'But my girls gave me the motivation to keep going and recover quickly, and my husband, Chris, was amazing.

'I'm so lucky - I was very close to losing my arms and legs - and even my life.

'I'm so glad I'm still here to be a mum for my girls.'

Mrs Cousan's first daughter, Olivia Grace, had been a Caesarean, so when she went home she thought being exhausted and weak was usual after a normal birth

Mrs Cousans received five different skin graft operations and had physiotherapy to learn to walk again

Sepsis is a common but potentially life-threatening condition.

It is triggered by an infection, and causes the body's immune system to go into overdrive.

It causes widespread inflammation, swelling and blood clotting.

It can lead to a significant fall in blood pressure, which can compromise blood flow to vital organs, including the heart, brain and kidneys.

If not treated quickly, sepsis can lead to multiple organ failure and death.

Each year in the UK, it is estimated more than 100,000 people are admitted to hospital with sepsis and around 37,000 people die as a result of the condition.

Early symptoms include:

Mrs Cousans was suffering from sepsis, a life-threatening blood poisoning that kills 37,000 people in the UK each year.

The poison was forcing her organs to fail and was causing necrosis - the death of body tissue - to her legs.  

Doctors put Mrs Cousans into a medically induced coma while they worked to drain her body of the poison that was killing her.

She was left with scars and parts of her muscles missing because the poison prevented oxygen flowing to the tissue, killing the body's flesh.

Mrs Cousans said: 'When I came around from the coma I knew something was wrong but I wasn't totally sure.

'It was a huge shock to realise I couldn't move.

'Because I'd been in a coma for so long I'd lost all the use of my muscles - I couldn't even move my fingers. 

'It was horrible because I still hadn't held Megan properly, they just had to lie her next to me.

'I had to have five different skin graft operations on my legs too and then I had to learn to walk again.

'There was just so much to deal with.'

Mrs Cousans first became ill the evening after Megan was born.

She said: 'Megan was born early in the morning and by the evening I was at home.

'But I began to feel very weak and tired - not myself at all.

'Olivia had been born by C-section, so as I'd never gone through a natural birth before I wasn't sure what to expect, I just thought that the way I was feeling was totally normal. 

Mrs Cousans was in hospital for 11 weeks, and found it difficult to be away from her daughters. 'I hated being away from them, I was worried all the time and I knew I was missing out on watching them grow up - especially with Megan,' she said

Daughters Olivia Grace, five and baby Megan Rose, 18 months came to visit their mother in hospital and took her scary appearance 'in their stride'

Mrs Cousans said her girls gave her the motivation to keep going and her husband Chris was 'amazing'

'But as the days wore on I was getting worse and worse.

'I was constantly thirsty and just totally exhausted - I could barely get out of bed.

'It was only when, six days later, a nurse came out to me, that she took one look at me and told me to get to the hospital immediately. 

'Apparently the infection actually gives off a smell, and the nurse could smell it in my bedroom.

'I don't remember much after that, but I know I was in a critical condition.

'I later found out that the doctors had caught me in what they call the 'golden hour' - the hour where they need to diagnose and treat me, or it's too late.

'I was incredibly lucky.'

'My story could have ended so differently, and I know I'm one of the lucky ones - many people don't survive' Mrs Cousans says

Doctors rushed her into an operating theatre where they worked to drain the body of poison.

She was then in a coma for 11 days while her body worked to recover.

Mrs Cousans, said: 'I was brought out of the coma after 11 days, but my journey was far from over.

'I was given five skin grafts on my legs where they'd cut away the dying tissue, and I then had to begin intensive physiotherapy to get my muscles working again.

'It was awful not being able to move - all I wanted to do was cuddle my girls and I couldn't.

'I hated being away from them, I was worried all the time and I knew I was missing out on watching them grow up - especially with Megan.

'I finally saw them after three weeks, but even then I was worried they'd be scared by my appearance.

'Luckily they took it all in their stride and slowly I went from strength to strength.

'But finally after 11 weeks in hospital I stood up on my own for the very first time, and the doctors agreed that I could go home.

'I was still unwell but being at home with Chris and the girls was the best medicine I could have asked for.'

Now Mrs Cousans has recovered, and is keen to raise awareness of the condition that nearly stole her life.

She said: 'I still don't know why I got sepsis, but it can happen to anyone at any time.

'I just want to make sure people are aware of the symptoms, and to get medical attention immediately.

'My story could have ended so differently, and I know I'm one of the lucky ones - many people don't survive.

'I can't thank the doctors and nurses who treated me enough, they saved my life.'
