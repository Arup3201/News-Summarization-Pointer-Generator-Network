Charges against the 22-year-old nephew of New York Giants owner John Mara stemming from a brutal assault at a New Year's Eve party have been dismissed.

The nephew, also named John Mara, faced up to 20 years in prison if found guilty of felony first-degree assault and misdemeanor breach of the peace.

The Mount Kisco, New York, resident professed his innocence from the very beginning, insisting he wasn't the person who battered party goer Phillip Blackman with a glass bottle.

William Dow III, Mr Mara's lawyer, was confident a jury would agree his client was innocent. He said today's dismissal vindicated that belief.

‘From the very beginning, Jack Mara swore he was innocent,’ Mr Dow said in a prepared statement, according to the Danbury Daily Voice.

'He did not assault the complainant,the evidence has proven his innocence,' Mr Dow continued. 'We are gratified that the State has agreed and that the charges are dismissed.'

The lawyer trumpeted the decision further, professing faith Mr Mara was in an unfortunate place that he will not soon find himself in again.

'Jack is an outstanding young man and has a bright future,' said Mr Dow. 'He and his family intend to move on from this unfortunate incident.

The alleged victim, Philip Blackman, 
said he had no recollection of the assault. He said doctors told him 
that if he had not gotten to the hospital and had emergency surgery to 
relieve pressure on his brain he might have died that night.

The arrest affidavit states that Blackman suffered a skull fracture and a brain hemorrhage.

According to his LinkedIn profile, 
Blackman worked as an auto technician assistant for Weston Service
Center in Weston, Connecticut. He is expected to graduate from 
Fairfield University with a bachelor's degree in communications and 
marketing.

Luke Kazmierczak, who was home from 
college for the holidays, told police he witnessed the incident. But he 
initially did not pick Mara out of a photo lineup of six men, the 
affidavit says.

Police said in the affidavit that the 
photo of Mara, a senior at Fairfield University, was when he was a 
freshman and looked significantly different.

When Mr Kazmierczak was later shown an updated photo, he immediately picked out Mara as the person he saw hit Blackman, police said in the original arrest affadavit.

Also, David O'Brien, a friend of 
Mr Kazmierczak's, took a photo of Mara that night and picked Mara out from a
photo lineup as the person his friend told him committed the assault, 
the affidavit said.

Mr Blackman said his friends told him he 
had bumped into a girl by accident at the party and some people at the 
party were trying to kick him and his friends out, according to the 
affidavit.

Police initially said that Mr Mara was upset after he was
told while walking to the house that his roommate's girlfriend was hit 
by someone. They describe him as highly intoxicated at the time and not 
wearing a shirt despite below-freezing temperatures.

‘I saw them fighting,’ a witness told
the New York Daily News. ‘I saw both groups come in. Both were drunk, 
looking for a fight and aggressive. Just drunk college kids.’

Another witness told the paper at the time that Mara was defending himself against a bigger man.

‘If you have a bottle in your hand, you don't need to be [big],’ said the witness, who is also a student at Fairfield.

Mr Mara has denied the assault from the beginning, police said. 
But they say when they first asked him why others were accusing him of the 
assault, he said: ‘I'm not sure. If I actually did do it, I would love 
to find out.’

Police said when they asked if it was 
possible he did not know he hit Blackman, Mara replied: ‘It could of 
happened because I was very drunk and there's a shot that I didn't 
remember.’

The younger Mr Mara is an anthropology and sociology 
major at the Jesuit School and lives in the nearby beachfront 
neighborhood where the assault allegedly occurred, university 
spokeswoman Martha Milcarek has said.

Mr Mara, whose father, Frank Mara, is 
also Vice President of Community Relations for the Giants originally turned himself
in to a police station in Fairfield, Connecticut.

Frank and his son Jack are central figures in the large but close-knit Mara clan.

Jack
regularly posts pictures from Giants games he attends with his father 
on his various social media profiles where he keeps in touch with many 
members of his extended family.

His father is the youngest son of the 11 children of Giants founder Wellington Mara and his wife Ann.

The Mara family own 50 per cent of the
team with Frank's oldest brother, John, at the helm and their brother 
Chris also in the front office.

The
Irish-American clan are well-known in New York as well as Hollywood 
where Jack's cousins actresses Rooney and Kate have become stars in 
their own right.

Like his son, Frank attended Fairfield University, graduating in 1982.

He lives in Bedford Corners, New York, with his wife Lynn. They have three other sons Sean, Frankie and Owen.   

Jack's
mother Lynn is an artist and teaches sixth grade religion at St Paul's 
in Greenwich. She also sits on the Giants Foundation.

In an interview for a Hamptons Magazine she said her perfect day would include 'a long happy dinner time with family and all the kids'.
