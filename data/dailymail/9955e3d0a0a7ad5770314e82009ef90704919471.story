A postcard mailed in 1940 has finally arrived at its destination, more than 70 years after it was sent.

Signed off by ‘Blanche’ it was sent from Portland and addressed to Florence Marion of Butte Falls, Oregon and did not turn up until July last year.

It took another nine months before a living relative of Florence – her great-grandson Alan Marion – could be tracked down and the postcard delivered.

Finally there: Alan Marion holds a postcard mailed to his great-grandmother Florence over 70 years ago that arrived in Butte Falls last year

The card carries a short message meant
 for Florence: ‘Arrived in Portland at 8 o’clock. Having a fine time. Be
 home sometime Sat. - Blanche.’

It is postmarked from Portland at 12.30pm, February 20 in 1940, but did not arrive in Butte Falls until last summer.

It was formally delivered to Florence’s descendant, Alan Marion from Phoenix, on Monday, April 14, 2014.

‘To
 me, it’s one of those things that must have been meant to be,’ Mr 
Marion, maintenance director at the Rogue Valley Genealogical Society 
told Medford Mail Tribune.

‘For everything to fall in place and show up at my doorstep, so to speak. I’m thrilled to have this card.’

Family treasure: Charleen Brown helped track down Alan Marion to give him the postcard meant for his great-grandmother, posted in Portland in February 1940

The
 postcard turned up at the Butte Falls Post Office last summer and a 
member of staff began looking into finding relatives of Florence Marion 
in the small town of just over 420 people.

After
 a chance encounter with one of Alan Marion’s colleagues at the Rogue 
Valley Genealogical Society, Charleen Brown, the post office were able 
to track him down.

Ms Brown
 looked into Florence Marion’s family on ancestry.com and was reminded 
that her colleague had mentioned that he had family in Butte Falls.

‘Being that Butte Falls was actually probably 350 people in that day, I knew it had to be the right one,’ Ms Brown says.

‘Somebody’s been looking over my shoulder here, and it must have been my great-grandmother,’ Mr Marion added

It is not known if Florence ever saw the postcard and it was put back into the system by accident after her death.

However,
 what Mr Marion knows about his great grandmother is that she lived in 
Jackson County all her life, died in 1952 and is buried in New Sharon, 
Iowa.

The sender, Blanche, remains a mystery.
