An 18-year-old who allegedly blazed a trail of crime across the South with his 13-year-old girlfriend has appeared in court for the first time since fleeing Kentucky.

Dalton Hayes, who along with Cheyenne Phillips, 13, drew comparisons with Bonnie and Clyde after they went on the run together, appeared via video-link from a jail in Panama City, Florida.

Appearing today on-screen at the Bay County Courthouse, Hayes, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, confirmed his identity and agreed to go back to Kentucky to face charges there.

Extradition: Dalton Hayes, 18, appeared at a courthouse in Bay County, Florida, Monday morning. He confirmed his identity, then signed papers consenting to be extradited

Hearing: Hayes, dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit, scratched himself in front of the judge during the brief hearing

Taken home: The sheriff in Grayson County, Kentucky, said he would take Hayes back in a separate car to his girlfriend, Cheyenne Phillips, 13

During the brief appearance Hayes, wearing handcuffs on-screen, scratched himself several times while being addressed, before agreeing to sign the paperwork. 

The couple were tracked down Sunday evening to an IHOP parking lot in the city, where cops found them sleeping in a stolen pick-up truck.

The vehicle was allegedly the third they had stolen. The pair are also accused of stealing two guns inside one car

Their two-week spree is believed to have taken them from Kentucky, into Tennessee, North and South Carolina, Georgia and finally Florida.

They were spotted begging at an undisclosed location in Florida on Friday, and were arrested Sunday night in an IHOP parking lot. They did not put up a fight.

Hayes waived the right to an extradition hearing, which means he will be taken back to Grayson County, Kentucky, from which he first fled with his girlfriend Phillips, whom he initially thought was 19.

Spree: Shown above are the known sightings of the pair, from their disappearance until their arrest

During the brief hearing, he told the judge: 'I'll sign the papers so I can go back to Kentucky.'

Charges: Hayes, who acknowledged charges against him, is facing counts of burglary, theft and trespass

The Grayson County sheriff, Norman Chaffins, said Sunday night that he had spoken to Hayes, who is 'very scared' about facing the consequences of his actions.

He said: 'I spoke to Dalton and he was very scared, and he wanted to come home. He wanted me to come bring him home.'

Chaffins told NBC News that the pair would be taken back in separate cars.

Hayes and Phillips are expected to be back in Kentucky by the end of the week.

Phillips has been taken to an undisclosed 'safe location', but is not in the state's custody, according to officials.

A spokesman for the Florida Department of Children & Families said: 'The juvenile has been taken to a safe location until arrangements with the family are made'.

Authorities said the U.S. Marshal's Service and Panama City Beach Police discovered Hayes and Phillips asleep in a car stolen from Georgia.

In Kentucky, the two teens will face charges including burglary, theft, criminal trespassing and criminal mischief, Chaffins said. Phillips will face charges in juvenile court because she is a minor.

Chaffins said he was relieved the crime spree ended peacefully. If the couple had not been found asleep and surrounded, he said, they may have run again.

Spotted: Hayes and Phillips were pictured above at a Walmart in South Carolina, where they allegedly forged checks to get money to finance their spree 

Hayes and Phillips began their run from the law and their families earlier this month when they vanished from their small hometown in western Kentucky.

Hayes' mother, Tammy Martin, had urged her son and his companion to surrender and 'face the consequences.'

She spoke today of her relief at their safe return. She told NBC: 'The first thing I'm going to do when I see him is hug him and tell him I love him - and then I might smack him.'

Martin said the couple had been dating for about three months. She said the girl portrayed herself as being 19, and the family, including Hayes, believed her.

She said Cheyenne 'would go in and write checks, and she would come out with cigarettes and stuff, so I didn't have any reason not to believe she wasn't 19.' 

It has since emerged that the pair announced on Facebook that they were 'engaged' just before they fled.

She even said Phillips told Hayes she was pregnant, and gave him a supposed ultrasound scan - though Martins appeared not to think the claims stood up to scrutiny.

One of three: The pair stand accused of stealing three pickup trucks over the two-week period. The were allegedly driving the above vehicle through South Carolina, but were arrested sleeping in another one Sunday in Florida

Moms: Phillips's mother Sherry Peters, left, and Dalton's mother Tammy Martin, right, both begged their children to give themselves up and come home. Martin added today that she wanted to give her son a hug - then 'smack him'

When he hit the road, Hayes was running away from trouble back home. He faces burglary and theft charges in his home county, stemming from an arrest late last year, according to Grayson County court records.

He was planning to be at the local judicial center on January 5 to find out whether a grand jury had indicted him on the charges. His case did not come up, but by that time the teens were gone.

Chaffins said the couple's behavior had become 'increasingly brazen and dangerous.'

Twice, the teens were able to evade law officers in Kentucky. They allegedly crashed the first truck they stole, then hid in the woods. Then they later stole another truck nearby, Chaffins said.

At one point, the two were spotted at a Wal-Mart in South Carolina, where the teens are thought to have passed two stolen checks.

Authorities said they believe they then headed to Georgia and stole a pickup truck southeast of Atlanta.
