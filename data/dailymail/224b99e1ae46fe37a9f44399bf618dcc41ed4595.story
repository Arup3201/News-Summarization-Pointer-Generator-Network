Tom Cleverley will remain at Aston Villa for the rest of the season, but is expected to join Everton in the summer.

Reports that United demanded Villa pay a £7million buyout fee or risk seeing the midfielder recalled to Old Trafford have been dismissed by a United source.

Sportsmail understands that the Bradford-born 25-year-old is keen on linking up with Roberto Martinez at Goodison Park and is set to do so at the end of the season following the expiration of his contract.

The 25-year-old has made 20 appearances for Villa so far this season but has failed to find the net

Cleverley is on a season-long loan with Villa who are currently 16th in the Premier League table. 

Paul Lambert's side have been without a win in the league since their 2-1 victory against Leicester on December 7.
