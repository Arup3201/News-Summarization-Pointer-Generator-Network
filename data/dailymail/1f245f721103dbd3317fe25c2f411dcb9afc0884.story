Diagnosed with breast cancer, Sara Cutting faced the prospect of losing her curly blonde hair during the rigours of chemotherapy.

But rather than let it get to her, she decided to embrace baldness by taking a selfie every day – and showing off a spectacular hat each time.

The 46-year-old company director makes her own headwear from anything she can get her hands on, including cakes, board games, a teapot, radio, lampshade and even kitchen roll.

Have your cake and eat it: Is it a hat? is it a snack? or could it even be both.  Sara Cutting has embraced her baldness by taking a selfie each day

She then uploads smiling selfies to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, where she has thousands of followers. 

And to cap it all, the idea has helped raise £9,000 for MacMillan Cancer Support.

Now on day 142 of the challenge, her treatment has finished and her hair is starting to grow back – but she has decided that she likes being bald and plans to stay that way.

‘Life has to go on and you have to find a way of coping, so this has been a really good focus for me,’ she said. 

‘It’s a reason for me to get my make up on, get dressed and put on a big smile, no matter how I’m feeling.’

Miss Cutting, who runs a building and renovation company in Brighton, said the experience has been ‘liberating’. Her selfies have generated many fans online, with offers of ideas coming in from as far as Australia.

And she has already worn hats by designer Philip Treacy, who was behind many of the creations worn at the Royal Wedding in 2011.

Miss Cutting, who was diagnosed with cancer last summer and began chemotherapy in October, begins a four-week course of radiotherapy next week. 

She hopes her challenge will help raise awareness and prompt others to check for signs of the disease.
