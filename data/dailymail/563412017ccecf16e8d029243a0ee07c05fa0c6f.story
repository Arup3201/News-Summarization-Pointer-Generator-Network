Their bodies were both found in the bedroom of their home on the southwest side of the city.

Chicago Police investigate an apparent murder-suicide involving a Chicago Police officer Veronica Rizzo-Acevedo and her husband, Cook County Sheriff's correctional officer Javier Acevedo

Shots rang out in the home just after 5 a.m. and a relative in the house called police immediately.

It's unclear what the motive was for Mr. Acevedo to kill his wife. He had been under investigation earlier this year for an off-duty road-rage incident, according to Smith.

The scene outside the Acevedo home on the southwest side of Chicago on Sunday. Police believe Javier Acevedo shot his wife, Veronica Rizzo-Acevedo, before turning the gun on himself.

'Officer Veronica Rizzo-Acevedo's death earlier today in a domestic murder-suicide is an awful tragedy for her family, her friends, her colleagues in the Chicago Police Department, and the people of this city,' Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said in a statement.

Rizzo-Acevedo had received 23 departmental awards during her time on the force.

'We’re accustomed to losing our (fellow officers) to violence on the streets, but when it’s something like this … it’s doubly hard to accept,' Chicago Police Chaplain Dan Brandt told the Chicago Tribune.
