The murder rate in global violence hotspots has declined by more than 40 per cent in 15 years thanks to better policing and a lower tolerance for disruptive behaviour, experts have revealed.

Murders in England and Wales have dropped by eight per cent, in Scotland by 19 per cent and in Northern Ireland by a staggering 61 per cent, new figures show.

It means, the murder rate in England and Wales is now at its lowest level for 36 years, while the homicide rate in the United States is at its lowest in 40 years.

Data by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reveals the vast number of countries where murder rates fell by 40 per cent or more between 1995 and 2010 (above, dark green) and those where crime increased (red)

The data, which will be presented at the first Global Violence Reduction Conference in Cambridge this week, shows how murder rates have been declining since the mid-1990s in many parts of the world.

Nations as diverse as Estonia, Hong Kong, South Africa, Poland, and Russia have seen average recorded murder rates drop by 40 per cent or more and out of 88 countries where trend data could be found, 67 showed a decline in homicide.

Only 20 showed an increase between 1995 and 2010, the analysis of data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime revealed.

Experts believe the drop in murder rates could be part of a wider trend which has seen improved policing strategies, tighter surveillance, and a lower tolerance for violent and disruptive behaviour from an earlier age, be rolled out in many countries.

Professor Manuel Eisner, director of the Centre for Violence Reduction at the University of Cambridge, said: 'Examples of successful homicide reduction over the past 15 years can be found across the world: from Canada and Italy to New Zealand and China.

'But if we want to achieve a worldwide decline in homicide we need to learn from these success stories and understand what they did right.

Murder rates have been declining since 1995 in many parts of the world. The latest figures (displayed above in a graphic showing the areas with the highest murder rates) show how rates have dropped by about 40 per cent

'Evidence from many places in the world suggests reductions in violence by about 2.3% per year - needed for a 50% drop in 30 years - are feasible and realistic.'

He emphasised that the figures did not yet show an overall global decline because some countries - primarily Latin American - have seen recent increases in the number of murders committed which may offset the overall picture.

However, he said that many European, Northern American and Asian countries have shown a steep decline in murder rates over the past two decades, and the lessons from these nations need to be built on.

He added: 'In London, the risk of being murdered has declined by a staggering 99 per cent from the late Middle Ages to the present day.

'In the last ten years alone, the number of homicides in London has been cut in half, from around 200 in 2003 to less than 100 in 2013, for example - making it one of the safest cities in the world.'

In England and Wales, the murder rate has dropped by eight per cent to 1.04 per 100,000 population since 1995.

In Scotland, the rate has dropped by 19 per cent to 1.8 per 100,000 population and in Northern Ireland it has fallen by 61 per cent to 1.4, according to the data.

Experts now believe that global rates of violence could be halved by 2040 if the right policies can be defined and implemented.

Analysis shows that societies with the highest murder rates in Latin America, Africa and Asia – such as El Salvador, Congo and Russia – suffer from a mix of corruption, highly profitable illegal markets, low investment in public health and education, and an ineffective police force that is not trusted by the citizens.

'Making the state more legitimate in the eyes of its citizens, the police more effective and accountable, and promoting the rule of law will be critical to achieve a significant decline of violence,' Eisner said.

Professor Lawrence Sherman, director of the University of Cambridge's Institute of Criminology, added: 'An accountable and effective police that are trusted by civil society is indispensable.'
