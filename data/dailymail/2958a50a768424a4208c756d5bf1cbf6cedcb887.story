A mother has come under fire for dressing her four-year-old daughter in a Hooters waitress outfit for a beauty pageant. 

Mother Liane, 33, from Portsmouth, created the controversial costume for Scarlett who featured in the Channel 5 documentary Blinging Up Baby.

Hooters is a chain of restaurants with 
waiting staff who are mainly young women in tight white tops usually 
referred to as Hooter Girls.

She even taught her a dance routine which included the splits and pelvic thrusts.

However, the costume and routine have been deemed 'inappropriate' by viewers.

Unemployed single mum Liane has ploughed everything into entering six-year old Bessie-Sue and four-year-old Scarlett into glitzy U.S.-style beauty pageants.

She said: 'They are very talented little girls but then I have invested a lot in them.

'I am ambitious for them and I do push them.

'She would probably be a tomboy if I let her,' says Liane, confessing that she had been a tomboy herself.

'I suppose that's what I'm influencing onto them, that they don't do everything wrong that I did when growing up' she said.

To compete in the Teeny Miss Beauty competition, Liane decides to dress Scarlet in a Hooters waitress outfit. 

Defending the decision, Liane said: 'You do try and be original, so something you have not seen before. 

'Some people may say it as controversial espeically the theme that I have chosen but at the end of the day little girls wear swimming costumes to the beach all summer and that's not a controlled environment.

'The environment my kids go in is a controlled environment and it is ticket entry only so if anyone thinks it's controversial then please explain because it aint at all.'

However, not all mothers at the competition agreed with the choice.

One parent said: 'I think Hooters is a bit inappropriate for a small child' while another thought it was 'fabulous'.

However, viewers took to Twitter to vent their disgust.

One said: 'Who the hell puts their child in a Hooters outfit and teaches them pelvic thrusting moves? How disgusting!'

Scarlet is not the only child to feature in the documentary. 

Sophie-May Dickson, 22, from Essex, sees nothing wrong with giving her daughters - Princess Bliss Tiana May, four, and PreciousBelle Ruby Rozina, two - the works including spray tan, nail polish, and designer clothes.

Princess regularly applies hair serum to her own hair and shares an incredible designer wardrobe worth thousands of pounds with her sister.

The closet, which could rival many women’s wardrobes, includes a pair of Ralph Lauren sparkly flat shoes costing £90 and a D&G child's dress costing up to £400.

Princess's flashy pink bed costs around £1,000.

Her two year-old, Precious Belle Ruby Rozina, whom she describes as a ’tomboy’ has her ears pierced and nails done.

Both girls wear gold hoops in their ears and Ms Dickson reveals that Precious had her first pedicure at nine months.

At Fairytale in Birkenhead, Marie Fullerton has been making bespoke children's wear for 25 years, but has never been as busy as she is today.

As a result of the huge demand, she now employs her son, daughter and daughter-in-law to help her.

It is not just clothes that they are asked to bling up – people have brought in potties, prams and even bath tubs, following a lead from Beyonce and the Kardashians. 

'Once you go into blinging, you cannot go back,' says daughter Hayley. 'I bling me phone cases, me make-up bag, everything...' 

As Marie prepares to expand into a boutique in the high street, she invites a few select customers in for a preview.

One of Marie's customers is 26-year-old beautician Sammy from Doncaster, who started buying frilly dresses and crystals for one-year-old Halle May before she was even born.

'I think that every woman thinks of their daughter as a doll,' she says. She trawls the internet for specialist boutiques, buying her own little doll designer clothes online months in advance. 

Despite limited cash, her daughter's wardrobe is worth thousands.
