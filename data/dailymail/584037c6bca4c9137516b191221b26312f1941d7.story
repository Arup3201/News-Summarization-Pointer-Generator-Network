From glamorous Cape Town socialite to west London girl - Chelsy Davy took her glamorous L'Ormarins Queen's Plate look down a notch when she stepped out in the capital today.

Looking fresh-faced and dressed for the winter weather, the down-to-earth Zimbabwean beauty took care of errands on a trip to the shops.  

The 29-year-old pulled her long blonde hair into a ponytail and wore a black jacket with fur-trimmed hood and trendy fingerless gloves showing off her red manicure.

Looking nonchalant and relaxed, the low maintenance Zimbabwean took a stroll to Boots and Waitrose. 

Under her black padded Triumph coat with a fur-trimmed hood, she wore a slim pink jumper.

Slim Chelsy, who dated Prince Harry for six years, was seen carrying a green croc-effect tote with chain detail straps, and a Boots bag.

Chelsy's casual trip to the shops comes just days after she was spotted at the annual L'Ormarins Queen's Plate in Cape Town over the weekend.

The stunner added a touch of glamour to the prestigious riding event in a cobalt dress, in accordance with the blue and white dress code.

She joined her brother Shaun and a few friends at a restaurant  for a quick drink before heading to the equestrian event.

Chelsy and her female friend complemented each other in similar short blue dresses worn with wedges on Saturday.

She might not mingle with the Royal Family anymore, but Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy still has a penchant for all things posh, such as the annual L'Ormarins Queen's Plate in Cape Town.

And there's no denying her dress sense is very Duchess-esque. Nude wedge heels and a classic cobalt dress by Stella McCartney? We could be describing the Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe!

We love the flattering frill in front of Chelsy's dress, which features a belted waist and V-neck. It's perfect for styling up or down depending on the occasion, plus the bold cobalt hue is bang on trend this season, with labels like Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga and Victoria Beckham all showing the shade on the runway.

The group struggled to get a taxi to the races, as the area was congested with road closures while the country's leading political party, the ANC, celebrated its 103rd birthday party at the nearby Cape Town stadium. 

Nearly 100,000 people were drawn to the area to join in the celebrations. Chelsy and her group eventually managed to arrange an UberBlack taxi to get them to the races in style. 

The event, now in its 154th year, is widely regarded as the first prestigious equestrian event of the year and attracts the glossiest locals. 

As well as 12 races, the illustrious event offers lavish entertainment and after-parties with a strict white and blue dress code.
