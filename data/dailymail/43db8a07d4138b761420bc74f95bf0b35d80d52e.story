Two 'untrained' sailors who bought their yacht on eBay smashed their boat onto rocks after getting lost just 400 yards into what was believed to be one of their first voyages.

The hapless pair went out in their £3,000 24ft vessel but were soon left teetering on a reef near the entrance to St Peter Port harbour in Guernsey.

These unnamed sailors had 'little or no knowledge' of the area or sailing and were attempting to move the yacht from one marina to another - only 700 metres away - when they ran it aground in the dark.

Unaware of the rocks until their pale blue boat Ardel crashed into them, they were forced into a Mayday emergency call to the coastguard and a lifeboat was sent to rescue them.

Lost: The pair of rookie sailors were on a 700 metre night-time cruise in the yacht they bought off eBay but smashed into rocks

But it could not get near the rocks so the local harbour master organised for the bungling seamen to be rescued by a dinghy at 2am yesterday.

The stranded yacht is now drawing crowds to Goubeau Reef off the Channel Island.

Subsequent tides have not been as big as the one that deposited the boat on the rocks and the yacht will remain there until a larger tide comes, or waves smash her to pieces.

Richard Poat, 52, a plumbing inspector who lives near the harbour entrance, said he awoke yesterday morning to see the stranded yacht.

He said: 'I woke up and saw the boat on the rocks that is only about 100 metres from the harbour.

Mystery: The two men managed to run aground just short of St Peters port harbour in Guernsey at the weekend in their £3,000 yacht Ardel

'I heard that the people on board were two Sikh gentlemen who had clearly not been aware of the reef.

'They were probably on the high tide at about 1am or 2am because that would have been the best time to move.

'They were between the Queen Elizabeth II marina and the harbour entrance and there is the reef between them.

'I went out on my boat to have a closer look and I’d be surprised if it survived when it comes off.

'There are quite a few people going out to have a look.”

Captain Peter Gill, the Guernsey harbour master, said: 'It happened just outside St Peter Port and the yacht was attempting to move from the QE II marina to another marina inside the harbour.

Error: The boat will not be dislodged unless there is a very high tide, meaning that it is more likely to be smashed to pieces by the waves and rocks

'They were doing it in the middle of the night and the distance is about 700 metres. They were about 400 metres into the journey.

'The people on board had little or no knowledge of the area and were not local. They were two men and were uninjured.

'In the end a harbour dinghy took them off because the lifeboat couldn’t reach them.

'They had been on the top of the tide and it deposited them on the rocks.

'Subsequent tides have not been as big so the yacht hasn’t floated off yet. The next tide that might do it is this afternoon.

'If that doesn’t do it then it might be lucky to survive because the weather forecast doesn’t look good.

'I heard that the men had bought the yacht off eBay.

'A similar thing happened last year with a French yacht, but before that it was several years before we had another incident.'
