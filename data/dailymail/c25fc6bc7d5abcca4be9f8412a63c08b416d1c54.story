The real bomber? Mohammed Abu Talb has been named as a likely suspect in the Lockerbie bombing

For 25 years, the Lockerbie Bombing has been shrouded in mystery.

Now, an Eyptian terrorist has been revealed as a likely suspect in the devastating attack.

Mohammed Abu Talb - who is serving life in prison for a series of bombings - has been named in a private investigation called Operation Bird.

He is alleged to be behind the blast that took place on board Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland in 1988 - killing 270 people.

The investigation - put forward as a report by Forensic Investigative Associates in London - has also accused the CIA of covering up Talb's role in the atrocity, according the The Sunday People and Exaro.

It was commissioned by lawyers for Libyan Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, who was jailed in 2001 for masterminding the bombing.

If the report is correct, it means al-Megrahi - who died of cancer aged 60 last year after being controversially freed from jail in 2009 - may have been wrongly imprisoned. 

Investigators claim key pieces of 
evidence in the case against al-Megrahi - including a fragment of 
circuit board for a timer - were faked.

They
 also allege the bomb was planted in luggage at Heathrow airport in 
London - not loaded by al-Megrahi in Malta, as the prosecution 
claimed during his trial in 2001.

And
 they say Talb - who was an initial suspect in the case - met with other
 Middle East terror suspects in the run-up to the bombing.

The report - written in 2002 - was supposed to form part of al-Megrahi's appeal in 2009, but it was never used.

However, it is due to be aired in an Al Jazeera TV documentary this week.

Its authors - Jessica de Grazia, a 
former New York chief assistant district attorney, and ex-Met police 
officer Philip Corbett - expect their findings to provoke calls for the case to be re-opened.

They conclude: 'We have never seen a criminal 
investigation in which there has been such a consistent disregard of an 
alternative and far more persuasive theory of the case.'

Talb,
 now 59, was jailed for life in 1989 after carrying out bombings in 
Copenhagen, Denmark and Amsterdam - killing one person and reportedly 
injuring a further 20.

Cover-up? The private investigation has accused the CIA of covering up Talb's role in the terrorist atrocity

He has always denied any involvement in the Lockerbie bombing - and even gave evidence against al-Megrahi during his trial in return for immunity from prosecution.

However, ex-CIA expert Robert Baer later claimed the terrorist had been paid $500,000 (£307,000) just months after the atrocity.

And Operation Bird suggests police were misled in
 their investigation due to a government agency - most likely, the CIA -
 deliberately covering up the true culprit.

Ms
 De Grazia and Mr Corbett said the five-month inquiry 'leads us to 
believe the investigation into the Lockerbie bombing was directed 
off-course as a result of government interference.'

They added: 'In our experience, the decision to intervene would have been made at the highest level of government, most likely a top executive of the United States Central Intelligence Agency.'

Earlier this year, members of the Lockerbie investigation 
team - including officers from Dumfries and Galloway Police - visited Libya to look into possible leads which could result in further convictions for the bombing.

However, Libyan authorities later said they did not want to 'dig into the past' amid
 fears they could be forced to pay out further compensation to the 
families of the victims.

Tragic: The Daily Mail's front page following the Lockerbie bombing on December 22, 1988

The Lockerbie bombing remains the worst terrorist attack to have been committed in the UK. 

On December 21, 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over the Scottish town of Lockerbie as it flew to New York from London.All 243 passengers and 16 crew members were killed - while a further 11 on the ground below also died.

Some of the victims' bodies were never found.

In November 1991, murder warrants were issued for two Libyan nationals - Libyan agent Abdelbasetal-Megrahi and Libyan Arab Airlines station manager Lamin Khalifah Fhimah.

However, al-Megrahi was the only person found guilty of murder.

He was controversially freed from a Scottish jail in 2009 on compassionate grounds because he had been diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer.

He died in Libya aged 60 last year.

Ministers insisted al-Megrahi's early release was a decision taken solely by the Scottish government.

But documents later came to light showing that the Labour party secretly helped free Megrahi to appease Colonel Gaddafi, who was threatening to scupper oil contracts and unleash ‘holy war’ on Britain.
