The euro stands on the brink of its biggest ever crisis today as Greeks vote in their general election – with the anti-austerity party Syriza maintaining a four-point lead in the polls.

With the euro at its lowest value against sterling in seven years, a Syriza victory could trigger panic in the EU and the eurozone – risking bankruptcy for Greece and its exit from the euro.

With the fate of Greece’s €240 billion bailout from the European Union and IMF unclear, Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras has rejected any suggestion that Athens is under pressure to come to terms with its creditors by the end of next month. 

All polls show Left-wing Syriza in the lead and inching towards the numbers needed for outright victory as its message of cancelling austerity and securing a debt write-off attracts Greeks hit by four years of wage and pension cuts.

‘Light has won over darkness. Victory and a majority are within our grasp,’ Tsipras told supporters at his final campaign rally in Crete on Friday.

Greece has gone through a deep recession and a quarter of its workforce are still unemployed. 

Yesterday it emerged that some Greeks have stopped paying their tax bills in recent weeks, hoping a Syriza government would not pursue the debt.

The reluctance of so many Greeks to pay taxes was cited as a fundamental cause of the country’s economic woes in the first place.

Meanwhile, Greek PM Antonis Samaras warned Syriza posed a grave threat to Greece’s economy and national security.

‘We will not allow them to take us back to the past,’ Samaras told supporters of his New Democracy party, in a last-ditch attempt to bolster support.

‘Syriza isn’t going to change Europe, instead it will turn it against Greece,’ he said.
