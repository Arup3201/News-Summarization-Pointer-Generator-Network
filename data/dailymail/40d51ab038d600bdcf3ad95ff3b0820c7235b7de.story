Former newspaper editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson will face trial in September next year over alleged illegal payments to public officials, they were told today.

Brooks, 44, ex-editor of The Sun and the now defunct News of the World, and David Cameron’s former spin doctor Coulson, another former News of the World editor, appeared at the Old Bailey.

Appearing alongside them were The Sun’s former chief reporter John Kay, 69, ex News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman, 55, and Ministry of Defence official Bettina Jordan Barber, 39, also facing charges linked to Scotland Yard’s Operation Elveden investigation.

The five defendants sat at the back of the court for the 10-minute hearing. The judge, Mr Justice Fulford, said they did not have to go into the dock.

Operation Elveden was set up by the Met Police in the wake of the phone hacking scandal to investigate claims of unlawful payments by journalists to police officers and other public officials.

During the brief hearing it was said that a plea and case management hearing is due to take place on March 8th at the Old Bailey.

The court heard it has yet to be decided who will face trial on September 10th, but it could include defendants facing allegations of phone hacking and bribery of public officials.

Brooks, Coulson, Goodman and Kay are charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office. These relate to payments allegedly made to gain confidential information about the royal family between 2002 to 2003 and January 2005 to June 2005.

Ministry of Defence official Bettina Jordan Barber, who is alleged to have been paid £100,000 between 2004 and 2012, is charged with wilful misconduct.

Those charged with phone hacking are Brooks, Coulson and four former News of the World journalists - news editor Greg Miskiw, former head of news Ian Edmondson, ex-reporter James Weatherup and former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck.

Coulson, who was NotW editor from 2003 to 2007, and Brooks, who edited the paper from 2000 to 2003 before moving to edit The Sun and then becoming chief executive officer of the two papers’ parent group News International, are accused along with the other journalists of conspiracy to unlawfully intercept communications.

In a separate case Brooks, of Churchill, Oxfordshire, along with her husband, Charlie, plus five others are accused of perverting the course of justice.

The charges relate to an alleged attempt to hide evidence from police investigating phone hacking claims, and illegal payments to public officials by the News of the World and The Sun.

Mrs Brooks’s chauffeur Paul Edwards, former personal assistant Cheryl Carter, head of security at News International Mark Hanna, and security staff Daryl Jorsling and Lee Sandell also face the charges.

The Met have arrested 52 people as part of Operation Elveden, including 21 journalists at The Sun.

All five who appeared in court today are on unconditional bail.
