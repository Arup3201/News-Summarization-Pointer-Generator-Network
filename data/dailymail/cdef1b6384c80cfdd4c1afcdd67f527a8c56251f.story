You had better not LE-GO climbing this world record-breaking tower made from Lego bricks.

At over 112 feet high, the tower made entirely from Lego bricks has found its place in the Guinness World Record books.

The incredible column was built by students from 32 schools across Wilmington, Delaware, who gave up part of their summer to complete the project.

Behold: The world's tallest Lego tower stands 112 feet high

The tower stands almost six feet taller than the last record winner, set in Prague in 2012, and is made from around 500,000 plastic Lego bricks - all donated by the students and members of the community.

Superintendent of the Red Clay Consolidated School District, Merv Daugherty, placed the last piece on top of the pillar on Monday night.

Towering: A school official had to use a cheery picker to put the finishing touches on the Lego monolith

Construction site: Building the structure resembled a construction site

Dr Daugherty said: “We knew it was going to be a huge task but we also knew that the district was up to the challenge.

“This has been a great community event and it shows what people can accomplish when they pull together.

“One kid could have never done this by themselves, but when we all work together as a team we can do something that people thought impossible.”

It is also the first Lego record to be held not by Lego themselves or a whole country.

The tower will eventually be dismantled and the Lego bricks will be distributed between local schools.
