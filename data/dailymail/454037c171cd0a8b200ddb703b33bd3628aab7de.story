There has been talk of Lukas Podolski leaving Arsenal in January, but if his Cooper Tyre Challenge performance is anything to go by, maybe Arsene Wenger should try and keep him.

Cooper Tire Europe visited Arsenal this week, and set Santi Cazorla, Mesut Ozil and Podolski a challenge, whereby they were instructed to kick a football through tyres lined up in the top corner of a goal.

Podolski has found appearances hard to come by for the Gunners this season, but in the challenge between him and his team-mates, it was the German forward that came out on top.

The challenge saw two targets - one with a single tyre, and the other with four consecutive tyres

There were two stages to the test - a single-tyre challenge, preceded by an infinitely more difficult four-tyre version. In the latter, it was Spanish starlet Cazorla that impressed, firing a magnificent strike through all four consecutive tyres - and the ball didn't even touch the sides.

The rest of the watching Arsenal squad couldn't resist getting involved, as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Alexis Sanchez, Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey, Joel Campbell and even goalie Wojciech Szczesny piled in to have a go at the challenge - and, surprisingly, it was only the keeper that managed to score through the hole.

In the one-tyre challenge, Cazorla, Ozil and Podolski all managed to fire a football through the target - eventually - although it was Podolski who came out on top.

The only forward of the bunch, you would expect the German international to be up there when it comes to scoring, but Podolski has been on the bench for the Gunners this season and started a little rusty. 

After numerous attempts, it came down to a sudden death shoot-out between Cazorla and Podolski - Spain vs Germany, midfield vs attack.

And it was Podolski who conquered. After making a love heart symbol with his hands, he high fived his Spanish opponent as he celebrated the victory.

His long-term future with Arsenal may be in doubt, but you never know... maybe Wenger was so impressed with his tyre challenge, that he'll keep him in north London for a little while longer. 

Want-away striker Podolski eventually won the challenge, with two points to Cazorla's one

Cooper Tire Europe became the first “Official Tyre” of Barclays Premier League club, Arsenal, earlier this year. The partnership reflects the values that Cooper and Arsenal share – a passion for performance and the drive for success. The multi-year deal will see the Cooper Tire Europe, which has its European technical centre and headquarters in Melksham, Wiltshire, support the London club for at least the next five Premier League seasons.
