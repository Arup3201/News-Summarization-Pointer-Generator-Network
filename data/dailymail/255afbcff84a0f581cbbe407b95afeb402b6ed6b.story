It’s really no wonder two in three Americans are overweight when they can choose between a pork belly-topped cheeseburger, 1,500-calorie cheesecake and sandwiches stuffed with mozzarella sticks.

The worst eight dishes for over-the-top fat and sodium content have been unveiled by a health advocacy group in a group of ‘dishonourees’ - but they’re sure to get your mouth watering.

From the Cheesecake Factory’s 1,530-calorie burger to the Cold Stone Creamery PB&C Shake, which has a whopping 2,010 calories, these are certainly poor choices if you’re planning a diet.

Juicy: IHOP's Monster Bacon 'N Beef Cheeseburger has two types of cheese on a Romano-parmesan bun

Mouth-watering: Denny's Fried Cheese Melt includes four fried mozzarella sticks and melted American cheese

Cut above: Morton's Porterhouse Steak weighs 24oz before it's cooked and comes in at 2,570 calories

The list was released by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) and features offerings from other restaurants, including Denny’s, International House of Pancakes and Applebee's.

The group suggests a typical adult should limit calorie intake to 2,000 a day and keep saturated fat below 20g and sodium below 1,500mg.

But each serving of the Xtreme Eating Awards winning menu items - mostly twists on the usual suspects of burgers, dessert and all things fried - nearly reaches or surpasses these guidelines.

Denny's Fried Cheese Melt is a grilled cheese sandwich with four fried mozzarella sticks inside. It amounts to 1,260 calories and 21g of saturated fat, not to mention 3,010mg of sodium.

Applebee's Provolone Stuffed Meatballs with Fettuccine has 1,520 calories and 43g of saturated fat.

The Cheesecake Factory's Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake alternates two pieces of red velvet cake with two pieces of cheesecake, for 1,540 calories and 59g of saturated fat.

‘If Americans are feeling a little more 
full when lumbering out of The Cheesecake Factory, Applebee’s, Denny’s, 
and other chains, it’s not in their heads'

Bonnie Liebman, CSPI nutrition director

Cold Stone Creamery's PB&C Shake (peanut butter and chocolate) has 2,010 calories and 68g of saturated fat.

Two out of three Americans are overweight, and such dishes increase their risk of obesity, diabetes, heart attacks and cancer, said Bonnie Liebman, the centre’s director of nutrition.

‘If Americans are feeling a little more full when lumbering out of The Cheesecake Factory, Applebee’s, Denny’s, and other chains, it’s not in their heads,’ Ms Liebman told the CSPI website.

Denny's and Applebee's both said they offer a wide variety of choices. Denny's pointed to its Fit Fare menu, and Applebee's to its Unbelievably Great Tasting and Under 550 Calories options.

Other restaurants have not yet commented. The U.S. government is trying to push restaurants to disclose nutritional information on their menus.

The Food and Drug Administration plans to issue rules requiring restaurants to list nutritional and caloric information by the end of the year.

Sue Hensley, of the National Restaurant Association, said the organisation’s data is showing restaurants are now offering a much bigger range of options including healthier foods.

‘Consumers can use the nutrition information provided by many restaurants and make the choices that makes the most sense for their diet,’ she told USA Today.

CSPI is an advocate group formed 40 years ago to campaign and educate on issues such as nutrition, health, food safety and alcohol policy.
