The dog that killed its owner's baby granddaughter in a frenzied attack was investigated by council officials just five months before the tragedy. 

The animal, believed to be a pitbull, was brought to the attention of local authorities following complaints from neighbours  in Daventry, Northamptonshire, in May. 

Daventry District Council officials visited the woman's home, but decided no action against the dog was needed. 

Neighbours placed a single bunch of flowers at the door of a home where a woman's granddaughter was mauled to death by a pitbull. The pet was reported to local authorities five months before the attack

On Friday it mauled its owner's six-month-old granddaughter to death before being destroyed by vets. 

Its owner was bitten repeatedly in the hand as she tried to pry the baby out of its mouth's grip.

Today council chiefs admitted doing nothing to prevent its dangerous behaviour after being phoned by one of the woman's neighbours. 

Ian Vincent, Chief Executive of Daventry District Council, said: 'We received one noise complaint in May from a neighbour relating to two dogs barking at the property.

'As with all such complaints, we spoke to the owners of the dogs who acted to control the noise to a reasonable level.

'We have not received any other complaints relating to these dogs. 

'We always encourage anyone with concerns about the safety of any dog to report them to us or the police.' 

Daventry District Council visited the property in May following reports that the dogs were too noisy 

Tragic: A message from neighbours left on a bunch of yellow and red flowers rests outside the woman's front door 

He added: 'Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the family following this tragic incident, which has shocked and saddened our local community.

'We are working with Northamptonshire Police to assist their investigation into the circumstances leading up to this tragedy.'

It comes after neighbours revealed they were worried about the animals in the weeks before the child's death. 

The residents, who didn't want to be named, said the 'devil dogs' were walked with muzzles.  

'The neighbours whose homes back on to the side of the house have been complaining to the district council and dog wardens since May.

'They have complained multiple times but nothing has been done. They were even recording sound levels.

'You could hear the dogs killing each other fighting non-stop in the house from 100ft away inside our house.

Neighbours claimed the dog was similar to a pitbull terrier (file image of the breed above) 

'They were screeching, growling and barking all the time. It was terrifying, they are known as the devil dogs.

'One of the ladies who complained said she was worried her two young children would be killed if they escaped.

'You see all the emergency services there and you really feel for the family.

'But at the end of the day if something had been done and the complaints were listened to then that little girl might still be alive.'

Daventry District Council said only one complaint had been lodged.  

While police are yet to formally identify the breed of the dog, residents claimed it is similar to pitbulls which are banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act of 1991. 

This afternoon a spokesman for Northamptonshire Police said the family had been devastated by the 'harrowing' incident. 

Detective Inspector Stuart Hitchon is leading the investigation into this incident.

He said: 'My officers are working hard to piece together the events that led to the tragic death of a six-month old child.

'We are supporting the family through what is an incredibly harrowing time.' 

A post-mortem examination of the animal was under way at Royal Veterinary College this afternoon.
