Every February and September, Fashion Week garners numerous headlines around the world for crazy outfits, accessories and too-skinny models.

So it's no mean feat to take the top spot out of London, Paris, New York and Milan as the most outrageous event of the season. 

But this year, thanks to numerous nipples, blackened faces and some bizarre yeti-inspired hairy slippers, Milan has bagged the title in just 24 hours.

Milan Fashion Week kicked off today and has already featured furry slippers and, blackened faces and multiple nipples (Pictured above: the Claudio Cutugno show, left, and the Gucci show, centre and right)

The Italian city kicked off its week of style with plenty of jaw-dropping antics from designers. 

Big fashion houses like Gucci guaranteed their clothes got people talking by sending scores of models down the catwalks with their nipples on show through barely-there sheer tops. 

They also accessorised with odd hairy-looking shoes on many of their models. 

The furry footwear resembled the giant slippers that were popular with teens in the 1990s. 

Several models bared their nipples as they walked the runway at the Gucci show during the Milan Fashion Week Autumn/Winter 2015

While many of the models had long or mid-length skirts, they were contrasted with see-through slips 

Models at the Gucci show also wore yeti-style hairy slippers on their feet 

Elsewhere, new designer Claudio Cutugno appeared to paint black faces on his models using glittery make-up as part of his Next Generation show. 

The Italian revealed that his collection was inspired by the artist Emilio Isgrò, who regularly uses bees in his art. 

The glitter and beading on Claudio's models' faces often appeared like they were being swarmed by insects.

At the Stella Jean show, models wore unattractive grey school-style socks with many of the outfits on show. 

The socks were pulled up to above the shin and offset with flat skate pumps. 

Some of the clothes were accessorised with floppy multi-coloured pom poms, and some models were masked by baggy sweaters in unflattering shades of green.
