Companies which exploit loopholes to avoid paying tax in Britain will be made to ‘damn well pay’, David Cameron said last night.

The Prime Minister pledged to clamp down on multinationals that funnel billions of pounds into offshore tax havens.

It follows controversy over the way firms such as Google, Apple, Starbucks and Amazon handle their tax affairs in the UK.

The Prime Minister vowed to clamp down on companies which funnel money abroad to avoid UK tax rates

Global giants have been accused of registering subsidiary companies in low-tax countries to avoid paying their full UK tax obligations.

Mr Cameron said: ‘We’ve cut the rate of corporation tax down to 20 per cent, we’re the most competitive place to come and start a business, but here’s the deal – if they have a low tax rate, those companies have damn well got to pay it.’

His comments are in contrast to that of the former chief executive of Sainsbury’s, who appeared to defend the multinationals.

Justin King, who left the supermarket giant in July, said the situation was ‘not black and white’ and that, if people did not like the tax methods used by a particular firm, they should shop elsewhere.

Last week, it emerged that Facebook had not paid any corporation tax in the UK for a second year in a row, despite recording sales of £50million, after pushing much of its revenues through a complex scheme in Ireland.

Mr Cameron said the culture is changing and those ‘sitting in boardrooms’ are realising it is ‘bad publicity’ for their business to avoid their tax responsibilities.

He was responding to a question from a worker at mobile firm O2 during a visit to its call centre near Runcorn in Cheshire yesterday.

Starbucks came under fire for its financial strategy which meant the company did not pay UK tax for years

The PM accused companies of being ‘very, very clever arranging their financial affairs, taking profit in different parts of the world’ and not paying tax on it.

Mr King, however, denied loopholes existed. 

He told a tax conference organised by Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee: ‘They are not loopholes.

'They are legitimate tax systems put in place by legitimate governments legitimately elected.

'It is wrong to lay that at the door of companies operating their business in a structure… constructed by government.

‘The first thing you have got to do is hold governments to account for putting those structures in place; that we have seen in Ireland.

'The Irish have come to the conclusion that the “double Irish” is not acceptable in their own parliament.’ 

Justin King defended the multinationals saying they were not operating loopholes merely following legitimate tax systems

Earlier this month, the Irish government pledged to abolish a controversial scheme known as the ‘double Irish’ which had allowed the country to be used as a tax haven by large foreign technology and drugs companies.

Mr King suggested that consumers who objected to such schemes should change where they shop to ‘reflect what they believe is right or wrong’ and choose a retailer which ‘most closely aligns with your values’. 

He said: ‘The vote with the wallet is the most powerful vote.’ Asked if it was morally right that companies exploited the law in this way, he added: ‘The word moral is unhelpful.’

Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said it was ‘morally reprehensible’ to avoid paying ‘a fair share of tax’ by exploiting Britain’s complex laws.

She said: ‘I understand how complex these issues are. However, the law needs to change, and the behaviour of companies and individuals must also change.

‘We want tougher tax regimes, closing the loopholes that companies exploit and prosecuting avoidance schemes. We need to simplify our tax systems, so that they are less vulnerable to abuse.’

Last year, accountants at the Fair Tax Campaign criticised Sainsbury’s for having three subsidiary companies based in the Cayman Islands, known for its low tax rate.

A Sainsbury’s spokesman said at the time the supermarket was ‘proud to play its part in society as a fair taxpayer’ and rejected allegations that it wasn’t paying its way.
