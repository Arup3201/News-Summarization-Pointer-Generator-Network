Tensions in Ukraine are continuing to escalate after Russia was accused of sending tanks and armoured vehicles across the border.

The allegation by military officials in Kiev came hours after Moscow announced that a second aid convoy would head to the region, raising suspicions that they are supplying arms to the rebels.

Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security Council, said a column of 10 tanks and two armoured vehicles had driven into the south-east of the country near Shcherbak, which has so far escaped the worst of the fighting.

Ukrainian soldiers stand at a checkpoint on a road near the city of Dnepropetrovsk, eastern Ukraine. Kiev said its forces clashed with an armoured column that crossed from Russia today 

The vehicles were spotted 11 miles from the city of Novoazovsk, which was shelled overnight.

The reported incursion could indicate an attempt to advance on Mariupol, a major port on the Azov Sea, an arm of the Black Sea. 

Moscow unilaterally sent around 200 'aid' lorries across the border on Friday, a move that Ukraine said was an invasion.

All of those vehicles have now returned to Russia after delivering goods to the rebel stronghold of Lugansk.

But Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced his attenions of a second trip along the same route, suggesting those who had been caught up in the fighting needed vital supplies.

As the conflict continues to intensify, hundreds of Ukrainian families have been sent 3,000 miles away to Siberia to begin new lives. 

More than 600 refugees have already travelled to the city of Irkutsk, close to Lake Baikal, some six time zones east of Ukraine.

Last week Ukraine and its Western allies denounced the arrival of a first huge convoy that crossed the border without Kiev's permission.

However Russia claimed it had lost patience with what it called Ukraine's stalling tactics. 

Even though the white-tarpaulined tractor-trailers returned to Russia without incident on Saturday, the announcement of another convoy could raise new suspicions that the Kremlin is supplying the rebels. 

Lavrov also said the food, water and other goods delivered to the hard-hit rebel city of Lugansk by the first convoy were being distributed  with the participation of the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Last week Russian soldiers were pictured standing next to a tank in Kamensk-Shakhtinsky near the Ukrainian border. Nato Secretary General Anders Fogh said the build up of ground and air forces has been alarming 

He said that soon 'there will no longer be anyone left to help' in Lugansk, where weeks of heavy shelling have cut off power, water and phone service and made food scarce.

The Ukrainian government in the past few weeks has been making strong gains, taking back territory from the rebels. It believed the aid convoy was a ploy by Russia to get supplies to the rebels and slow down the government advances.

On Sunday, as Ukraine celebrated the anniversary of its 1991 independence from Moscow, President Peter Poroshenko announced the government would be increasing its military spending in a bid to defeat the rebels.

In rebel-held Donetsk, captured Ukrainian soldiers were paraded Sunday in the streets, jeered by the crowd and pelted with eggs and tomatoes.

Families flee the bloodshed: Ukrainian refugees  are sent to Siberia to begin new life

By WILL STEWART 

Refugees from the bloodshed in eastern Ukraine are being sent to Siberia to begin a new life.

In an echo of the Second World War, when many were forced to flee to the east of Russia after Hitler attacked their towns and cities, trains are carrying displaced people on a five day journey to new homes.

Moscow claims that the West has ignored the scale of the humanitarian crisis, which has led to hundreds of thousands of people pouring out of the provinces of Lugansk and Donetsk, in rebel held Ukraine, as government troops from Kiev seek to regain the territories.

Moving pictures of children and families sent to a new life in Siberia have emerged after trains delivered more than 600 refugees to the city of Irkutsk, close to Lake Baikal, some six time zones east of Ukraine, a distance of almost 3,000 miles

'The latest groups of refugees to arrive comprises 606 people including 175 children, with 20 below the age of 12 months,' said the Siberian Times 

'All have fled the humanitarian nightmare in eastern Ukraine, to which the Russian government accuses the West of turning a blind eye.

'Many more are expected to arrive in Siberia, as they flee the violence in the territories of Lugansk and Donetsk.

'Two more trains in August will bring 930 Ukrainian citizens to Irkutsk, safe from the bombs and bullets in their native land.'

The West blames Moscow for fomenting the unrest on the east by supplying separatists with fighters and arms, a charge rejected by Russia.

Hundreds more are expected to arrive in the city of Irkutsk on trains and coaches as they look to escape the violence in Lugansk and Donetsk

Some refugees say they were given little option but to accept the Siberian offer, only allowed to stay in tented camps near the border for three nights before which they must move on.

Many have lost their blitzed homes. Others deem it too dangerous to return to regions where battles between the army and rebels are a daily reality.

Before leaving his refugee camp in Rostov region, Alexander, 73, said: 'Can you believe it? Just two days ago I was having breakfast in Lugansk in the apartment in which I was born, and now it no longer exists.

'It's been destroyed, and now, at my age, I have to start my life over in Irkutsk.'

Couple Dmitry and Anna fled with their two children from a village close to war-ravaged Lugansk.

'Leaving will allow us to turn the page,' said Anna. 'Our children will be able to go to school normally and grow up without anyone accusing them of being on one side or the other.'

Refugees, some of whom also brought pets with them, were given little option but to travel to Siberia. They can only stay in the tents for three nights before they are forced to move on

Dmitry said when he gets his first rouble wages from his new job, he will buy clothes for his family, pots and pans, and a fridge.

'Little by little, we'll build ourselves a new life in Russia better than the one we had in Ukraine,' he said.

Local official Valentina Voblikova said: 'Those seeking jobs will consider the vacancies we have in the region.'

The United Nations says 730,000 people have left Ukraine since the start of the conflict though not all are refugees.

Of these some 168,000 have registered as refugees, according to UNHCR. The refugees will face a dramatic weather change in their new homes.

Donetsk has average winter lows of minus 7C while the figure is minus 22C in Irkutsk. Others have been moved to Tyumen in western Siberia, and to Yekaterinburg in the Urals.
