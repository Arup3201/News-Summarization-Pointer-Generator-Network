This herd of 30 deer roamed the streets at night as residents slept, completely unaware the animals had decided their gardens would make a nice, light snack.

The herd of fallow deer live in a wooded area near the houses in Essex and at around 11pm, when the roads were deserted, they crept out of their home to eat the grass.

Around 30 deer appeared and wandered through the streets until 4am, before returning to the woods.

Amateur photographer Mark Bridger captured the deer on camera as they explored the streets and people's gardens

Photographer Mark Bridger captured the deer on camera as they explored around the houses and people's gardens.

The 46 year old, who works as a graphic designer, said: 'I love to take photos of deer, and to see them in an urban environment was strange but satisfying when you got the shot.

'The deer were very, very skittish and they are aware that they only have one or two escape routes if they need to run.

'The slightest noise and they are off and for such a large animal they can disappear into the shadows in seconds.'

Unfortunately for the unsuspecting home owners, it was their immaculately kept gardens which lead to the deer wanting to eat their grass and plants.

Mr Bridger, from West Malling, Kent, said: 'There is a lack of natural woodland areas left for the deer, and for the number of fallow deer that are wild in the UK now.

Looking for new, safe places to eat the deer were drawn to the suburban area after dark, while residents were asleep

'The grass and plants in the gardens were well looked after so the deer go where the food is, and it just so happens it is around normal houses.'

Mr Bridger added that patience and staying silent were key when photographing this big herd of deer in Essex.

He said: 'You have to be ultra quiet to do this type of photography, they are wild animals in an urban environment as so they are very nervous and disappear at the slightest hint of people.

'When we saw the group we parked up around the corner and got out of the car, then crept as quietly as we could to get into a position where you hope the deer will walk into.

'This is probably the hardest photography I've done.'

Mr. Bridger said he had to have as much patience with the animals as possible because they were nervous of their new surroundings

 

Carefully in position and hoping the deer would come near, the amateur photographer took these shots, the best he's ever done

Mr Bridger waited quietly so that they were not scared and when the animals came closer took these pictures
