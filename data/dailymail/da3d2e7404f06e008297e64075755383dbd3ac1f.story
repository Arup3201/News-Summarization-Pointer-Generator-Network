Rangers caretaker boss Kenny McDowall has sensationally revealed that he has been told he must play the five Newcastle loan players added to his squad on transfer deadline day.

The Toon quintet of Slovenian playmaker Haris Vuckic, English defender Remie Streete, Burundi-born midfielder Gael Bigirimana, Swiss defender Kevin Mbabu and Northern Ireland winger Shane Ferguson have joined the Ibrox club until the end of the campaign.

Newcastle and Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley is a shareholder at Rangers with an 8.92 per cent stake, and he and Rangers face hearings before the Scottish Football Association in March over the tycoon's possible breaches of dual interest rules.

Speaking at the Murray Park training centre, McDowall, who has signaled his intent to leave at the end of the season, said: 'On Monday night I got a call from Derek (Llambias, Rangers chief executive) saying he had secured five players on loan.

'Three of them arrived and two of them will be coming the next three or four weeks - they are injured.

'When I was given the job I was told players incoming and outgoing wouldn't be my responsibility.

'I take the team and coach the team and I am more than happy to get on with it.

Asked if he was duty-bound to play them, he replied: 'Yes.'

Then asked if he had to play every one of them every week, he again, replied: 'Yes. They are obviously good players - they play for Newcastle.  

I will carry on and do what I am told to do.'

Northern Ireland winger Shane Ferguson has also joined Rangers on loan until the end of the season

 With Newcastle players now moving to Rangers on loan, Mike Ashley's interest in the club continues to grow

Gael Bigirimana: The 21-year-old has made 26 appearances for Newcastle since arriving from Coventry City in 2012 for £1m. After impressing during his first season, the Burundi-born midfielder - likened to Cheick Tiote - has failed to progress and was soon demoted to the reserves.

Haris Vuckic: The playmaker joined Newcastle from Domzale in 2009 - after they beat off competition from AC Milan - but he has struggled with injuries, damaging his knee and ankle ligaments in one match for Slovenia Under 19s. He has previously been loaned out to Rotherham United and Cardiff City.

Kevin Mbabu: The 19-year-old Swiss defender joined Newcastle's academy in January, 2013 but is yet to make an appearance for the first team.

Remie Streete: English centre back Streete is a product of the club's youth system and joined them as a 13-year-old. He was loaned to Port Vale earlier this season. He was highly-rated all through his progression at the academy but now looks set to leave the club in the summer.

Shane Ferguson: Northern Ireland winger Ferguson has made 30 appearances for Newcastle and, under Alan Pardew, enjoyed a run in the side in 2012. He lost his place, however, and hasn't featured for the first team in nearly two years. He also has 18 senior caps for his country.
