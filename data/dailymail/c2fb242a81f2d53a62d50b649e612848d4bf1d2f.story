Npower chief executive Paul Massara has warned Britain needs new energy infrastructure as the country's spare generation had fallen to five per cent

Britain could be at risk of blackouts by next winter, the boss of one of the Big Six energy companies has warned, as old power plants are closed and have not yet been replaced.

Npower chief executive Paul Massara said Britain needs new energy infrastructure as the country's amount of spare generation at peak times had fallen from 15 per cent to five per cent this year.

Mr Massara said the shortfall raised concerns over the possibility of blackouts as soon as next year.

Mr Massara told the BBC's Panorama programme investors needed clarity over energy policy to be provided by the Government, in order for new plants to be built.

He said: 'The amount of spare generation at the peak has gone down from about 15 per cent to this winter when we'll be about five per cent. Next winter will be even smaller.

'So will we get through this winter? Yes. Will we get through next winter? I don't know.'

The warning came as the chief corporate officer of ScottishPower today warned the Government's carbon tax, which charges companies for burning fossil fuels, could make the country 'even more vulnerable to the threat of blackouts'.

Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Keith Anderson said the green levy will force coal-fired plants to close too quickly.

In October the National Grid warned the risk of blackouts this winter was at its highest for six years as Britain's reserves of electricity had halved in 12 months.

The report said Britain would have ‘margins’ of only 5 per cent, the lowest since 2007, as it headed into the freezing months.

The margin is the difference between the peak demand and the available supply from the UK’s power stations and import pipelines.

If it gets too low, National Grid can issue warnings to generators to begin producing more electricity to prevent a shortfall developing. But if these warnings do not work and the margin between supply and demand reaches zero, then parts of the country could experience blackouts.

National Grid director Chris Train however insisted the lights would not go out.

He said: ‘While there have been power station closures since last winter, the information suggests that the market can meet demand in cold weather. But as the system operator, we’re never complacent.’

The number of coal-based power plants operating in the UK has fallen because of EU legislation which has caused older, polluting, fossil fuel plants to be turned off.

One fifth of the UK’s coal capacity has been closed down in the last year because of the EU’s emissions rules.

A prolonged cold snap, such as the one seen earlier this year, could drain the UK’s gas reserves as millions of families keep the heating on to ward off the chill.

The amount left in Rough, the UK’s largest store, hit a record low earlier in the year after freezing temperatures lasted longer than expected.

Last March Britain came within hours of running out of gas after one of the under-sea pipes that imports gas from the Continent broke down.

Critics said it showed that the country needed to build more gas storage facilities. Currently the UK has enough gas storage for only 21 days, while European neighbours can hold enough gas for 100 days.

All of the Big Six energy companies have announced price rises this year, with E.On the last to do so on Friday when it unveiled a 3.7 per cent increase.

The size of that increase took into account the Government's roll-back of green levies, which is expected to knock £50 off the average family's fuel bill.

In last week's Autumn Statement George Osborne confirmed a plan announced earlier in the week by the Department of Energy and Climate Change to make changes to green levies.

In total, the Government claims green taxes add £112 to the average bill. The changes announced yesterday will reduce household's bills by £50 and bring the average bill rise down from £120 to £70 a year.

The Chancellor announced that the Energy Companies Obligation, an insulation scheme delivered by energy providers, will be extended for two years until March 2017, shaving £30-£35 off the average bill next year.

A further £12 rebate on electricity bills will also be added and families will also benefit from a reduction in energy network costs, saving them £5.
