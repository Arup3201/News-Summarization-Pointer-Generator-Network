Furious French First Lady Valerie Trieweiler is claiming £70,000 pounds in damages over a book claiming she cheated on her husband with two lovers at once.

Valerie Trierweiler was the shared mistress of left-wing President Francois Hollande and a right-wing minister while she was married, the biography called The Troublemaker claimed.

The 47-year-old divorcee has now launched legal action against the authors, which exposed the details of her complicated sex life.

Fury: Valerie Trierweiler, partner of France's President Francois Hollande, is suing the authors of a book over claims she was a 'shared' mistress of Hollande and conservative ex-minister Patrick Devidijan

Claims: It is alleged in the book that left-wing President Hollande knew he was 'sharing' Ms Trierweiler with Patrick Devidjian during their affair nine years ago

Her lawyer Frederique Giffard said the first lady was seeking damages for libel and breach of privacy for the 'malacious and unproven rumours aimed at sullying her character'.

Ms Trierweiler also recently sued a French magazine for publishing photos of her in her bikini while on holiday with President Hollande this summer - and was awarded the 'minimum' 5,000 pounds in damages.

Rumour: Patrick Devedjian allegedly had an affair with Valerie Trierweiler

The new biography claims she was having 
affairs with Mr Hollande, 58, and former conservative minster Patrick 
Devidjian, now 68, while still married to Denis Trierweiler nine years 
ago.

Both men knew they were 'sharing' Ms Trierweiler as their mistress, the book by political writers Christophe Jakubyszyn and Alix Bouilhaguet says.

But when Mr Devidjian refused her demands to leave his wife, she chose her affair with Mr Hollande over him, before finally divorcing her husband in 2010.

The book says: ‘Patrick Devedjian hesitated so much that Valerie Trierweiler allowed herself to be courted by a second man of another political persuasion: Francois Hollande.

‘Little by little, the relationship with Hollande took precedence over the other, notably after an ultimatum in 2003 which Devedjian failed to respect.’

The case is due to be heard in a Paris court on December 10.

Since becoming first lady, Ms Trierweiler has also been at the centre of accusations she tried to wreck the political career of Segolene Royal - the mother of Mr Hollande's four children.

She sparked national outrage in June when she tweeted her support for a candidate standing against Ms Royal in the parliamentary elections.

Ms Royal lost the election and later said she had been 'stabbed in the back' by Mr Hollande's girlfriend.

The French leader's former partner of 28 years went on to accuse Mr Trierweiler of costing her a place in Mr Hollande's cabinet.

Ms Trierweiler also faced humiliation last week when her boss at the French magazine where she works said she would be sacked at the end of this year.

Glossy weekly Paris Match's owner Arnaud Lagardere described her 47-year-old divorcee 'an unpinned grenade' who has caused him 'nothing but trouble' and said he would not be renewing her contract in January.

Mr Lagardere's comments were in a biography of the millionaire media tycoon by journalist Jacqueline Remy.

Ms Remy said it was suggested to Mr Lagardere in June that having the French First Lady as an employee would surely help him get 'the ear of the president'.

But he is quoted as replying: ‘Are you kidding? Up until now, she's caused us nothing but problems.’

He went on: ‘She's like an unpinned grenade.’

And Paris Match would be 'letting her go' next year to avoid any 'conflict of interest', he said.

A separate book about Ms Trierweiler called Between Two Fires, by investigative journalist Anna Cabana describes her 'a cocktail of jealousy, vengeance and political calculation'.

And a third book about her called The Favorite by journalist Laurent Greilsamer also writes: ‘As I see it, you have shown yourself to be not normal, snooty, infatuated, explosive, unpredictable. And visibly dangerous.’
