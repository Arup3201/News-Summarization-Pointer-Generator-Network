Self-promotion: Queens Park Rangers footballer Joey Barton is planning to launch his own website

He’s tried to transform his reputation from footballing bad-boy to philosopher on Twitter.

Now Joey Barton is planning to launch his own website after racking up almost 1.4million followers on the site.

The footballer, 29, said he feels frustrated by having to express himself in just 140 characters so is looking to branch out.

Barton has Tweeted on football, philosophy, politics and art as he attempts to shrug off his negative image.

He has moved seamlessly from quoting philosophers to insulting figures like Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer for the clothes he wears on screen.

But the Queens Park Ranger midfielder has courted controversy and was threatened with legal action after Tweeting about John Terry’s racism case.

Barton’s Tweets suddenly stopped on March 24 when he decided to take a Twitter ‘sabbatical’ before saying something he would end up ‘regretting’.

However, today after three weeks of silence he Tweeted ‘Justice for the 96!’ – in support of the families of the people killed in the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster on the 23rd anniversary of the tragedy.

It is unclear if he is going to return to Twitter full-time – or if it was a final Tweet in support of the Liverpool supporters killed on April 15, 1989.

Before he ‘quit’ the site on March 24 he wrote ‘have a good few weeks people’ – suggesting it was his intention to return.

The footballer said his website will be JoeyBarton.com and will not feature adverts as it will not be about making money.

The website, which he described as ‘almost a self-publication’ will contain his words along with video content.

He told the Observer: ‘For me, it’s about being a hub, or being involved in helping people to kickstart conversations that maybe will help make a change for the better.’

The footballer, who has played for Manchester City, Newcastle and most recently QPR, is currently writing an autobiography.

He became notorious when he stubbed out a cigar in an academy player’s eye in 2004.

Four years later he spent 74 days behind bars after being involved in a fight in Liverpool.
