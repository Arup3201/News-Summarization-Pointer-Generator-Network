Swapping the lab for nightclubs has proved a smart career move for Dr Rebecca Slane.

The first class honours graduate and lecturer was top of her class at the University of Sunderland, spending her day in a white coat and sensible shoes.

But now, she has reinvented herself as Toxic Cherry, a pole dancer and burlesque performer who wears hot pants and towering heels.

Dr Rebecca Slane has reinvented herself as Toxic Cherry, a pole dancer and burlesque performer

Cherry said she has never looked back since leaving her job as a lecturer in medicinal chemistry to launch her own dance school.

She took up the pole when looking for a new form of exercise to get her in shape while she was studying for her PHD.

And her inspiration came in the form of an Australian pole dancer.

'She was brilliant,' said Cherry, a former gymnast who grew up in Newcastle.

'She
 was sexy and she had boobs and a bum! She had a great figure without 
being stick thin. I learned a lot from her and eventually I took over 
her classes.

'I finished my
 PHD and took on a brief lectureship at Sunderland, but juggling my pole
 classes with a full-time job was hard work.Â 

Cherry said she hasn't looked back since leaving her job as a lecturer in medicinal chemistry to launch her own dance school

'I started off with four girls and, by the end of 2011, I was teaching 40 girls on a regular basis. I knew I had to make a decision. I was starting to compete and I couldn't do everything.

'I decided to leave my job at the university and concentrate all of my efforts into Cherry Dance Academy.

'I now teach around 150 people a week and it's the best thing I've ever done.'

In the past three years, Cherry has 
travelled the length and breadth of the UK performing and competing in 
pole dancing competitions.

In 2012, she picked up the UK Pole Professional Cup and is number one in teaching Level 5 pole dancing.

She also has a permanent residency at The House of Smith bar in Newcastle.

'Rebecca said: 'I started off with four girls and, by the end of 2011, I was teaching 40 girls on a regular basis. I knew I had to make a decision. I was starting to compete and I couldn't do everything.'

She said: 'Some people say I've wasted a good education by becoming a professional pole dancer and teaching my classes, but they're wrong.

'I loved my job as a lecturer and I love science, but it began to feel a bit suffocating.

'I'm one of those people who likes being my own boss and using what I've learned to help others.

'I work with a lot of victims of domestic abuse and I do work with victims of rape. If dancing helps them and rehabilitates them in any way then I feel I've done my job.

'Seeing my dance students develop and become healthier over time brings me so much satisfaction. We empower one another.'
