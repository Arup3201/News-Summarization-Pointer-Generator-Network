Arrested: Megan Rice, an 82-year-old nun, was one of three who allegedly broke into a nuclear facility

Two men and an 82-year-old nun allegedly broke into the U.S. government's only facility for handling, processing and storing weapons-grade uranium, government officials said Thursday.

The Oak Ridge, Tennessee facility has been temporarily shut after the security breach, and now 82-year-old Sister Megan Rice, Michael Walli, 63, and Greg Boertje-Obed, 57, face criminal charges of trespassing.

Officials said the facility was shut down on Wednesday at least until next week after the three activists cut through perimeter fences to reach the outer wall of a building where highly enriched uranium, a key nuclear bomb component, is stored.

The activists painted slogans and threw what they said was human blood on the wall of the facility before they were arrested shortly before 4.30am last Saturday.

The numerous buildings in the facility are known by the code name Y-12, that it was given during World War II, Reuters reported.

While moving between the perimeter fences, the activists triggered sensors that alerted security personnel. But officials conceded the intruders were still able to reach the building's walls before security personnel got to them.

Ellen Barfield, a spokeswoman for the activists who called themselves 'Transform Now Plowshares,' said three were arrested and charged with vandalism and criminal trespass.

She said Rice, Walli, and Boertje-Obed were being held in custody and appeared for a hearing before a U.S. magistrate judge in Knoxville, Tennessee, on Thursday.

A statement released on Plowshares’ website read that the use of blood was meant to ‘(remind) us of the horrific spilling of blood by nuclear weapons.’

A detention hearing is set for Friday afternoon, when prosecutors must show the defendants are a flight risk and a danger to the community in order to keep them in custody, according to court officials. 

The trial date is October 9.

The activists had apparently passed through four separate fences and walked for 'over two hours' before reaching the uranium storage building, on which they hung banners and strung crime-scene tape, ABC News reported.

Ralph Hutchinson, coordinator for the Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance, said the group's intention was not to demonstrate the lack of security at the plant, but to take a stance against the making of nuclear weapons.

'It wasn't so they could show how easy it was to bust into this bomb plant, it was because the production of nuclear weapons violates everything that is moral and good,' Hutchinson said. 'It is a war crime.'

Officials said that the storage building itself, which was built after the September 11, 2001, Al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, was designed with modern security features and that its contents were not compromised.

WSI Oak Ridge, the private firm employed by the U.S. Department of Energy to provide security at Y-12, is a subsidiary of the giant international security firm G4S.

G4S drew criticism for failing to provide the number of security personnel it promised to protect the London Olympic Games, forcing the British government to deploy extra army troops.

A spokeswoman for G4S declined to comment and referred inquiries to government spokespeople.

The security failure was an embarrassment both for the security firm and for the National Nuclear Security Administration, or NNSA, the Energy Department branch that operates U.S. nuclear weapons plants. 'It was obviously a pretty serious incident,' NNSA spokesman Joshua McConaha told Reuters.

'We're taking this very, very seriously,' added Steve Wyatt, a spokesman for the NNSA office in Oak Ridge, which supervises the activities of Y-12 contractors.

The NNSA officials said the activists cut through two chain-link fences surrounding the sprawling facility and a third fence surrounding the ultra-secure enriched uranium stockpile building, known as the 'Highly Enriched Uranium Materials Facility.'

Wyatt said the building served as the U.S. government's only 'warehouse' for storing highly enriched uranium used in nuclear weapons.

Highly enriched uranium is a radioactive material used in the core of bombs to produce a nuclear detonation. The Oak Ridge plant is one of the most important government installations involved in the maintenance and production of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.

Although the security breach occurred overnight last Friday, officials confirmed that the shutdown - which applies to 'all nuclear operations' at the Y-12 site - did not begin until Wednesday. Officials said it was expected to continue into next week.

In the meantime, personnel at the facility would be given additional security training.

Peter Stockton, a former congressional investigator and security consultant to the Energy Department, expressed scepticism at government assertions the nuclear material was not at risk.

'It is unbelievable this could happen,' Stockton said. 'The significance is outrageous. If they were terrorists, they could have blown open the door and got inside.'
