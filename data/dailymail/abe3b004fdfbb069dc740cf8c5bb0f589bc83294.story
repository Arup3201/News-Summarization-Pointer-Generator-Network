Setting foot on the platform, you could be forgiven for thinking 
you had travelled back in time and arrived in the golden age of steam.

It's all there - the smell of burning coal, the hissing of the steam and the clanking of the wheels as an engine is shunted back and forth.

But this is no 1930s fantasy. It's Baker Street station - and it's all happening in the here and now.

For the first time in more than 100 years, a steam train was carrying passengers on the Tube yesterday.

A restored original locomotive hauls a Victorian first-class carriage through Baker Street station in a test run for London Underground's 150-year anniversary celebrations

In a test run for London Underground's 150-year anniversary celebrations, a restored original locomotive hauled a Victorian first-class carriage from Earl's Court to Moorgate.

Billowing clouds through the capital's oldest tunnels, the weekend's recreation followed some of the route of the world's first underground railway journey in 1863.

Shortly after 1pm on January 9 in 1863 the inaugural train pulled out of Paddington station to begin a 3.5mile journey under the capital's streets and into the history books.

In all its glory: The train was built in 1898 and withdrawn from the tracks in 1963

It was a novelty that thousands of Londoners were eager to experience for themselves and to admire what one newspaper called 'the most stupendous engineering undertaking yet achieved in the railway world'.

And as on the very first journey in the 19th century, railwaymen, enthusiasts and a few dignitaries were aboard the train and riding inside the restored Metropolitan 353 carriage in the small hours of yesterday morning.

The train was built in 1898 and withdrawn from the tracks in 1963.

1898

Built in 1898, Met Loco No. 1 is the only survivor of a class of seven engines designed by the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Met, Mr T. F. Clark, for use on the Baker Street to Verney Junction service. It was the last locomotive constructed at the Met’s Neasden Works.

1904On 4 July 1904, decorated with flags and bunting it headed the first passenger train on the opening of the Uxbridge branch from Harrow-on-the-Hill.

1933The locomotive is taken into London Transport ownership when the Metropolitan Railway was taken over by the London Passenger Transport Board on 13 April 1933.

1936The locomotive is renumbered L.44 and is repainted in London Transport livery.

1963The locomotive was withdrawn, after a final moment of glory when in took part in the Metropolitan Centenary parade at Neasden on 23 May 1963, where it hauled four Ashbury bogie coaches and a milk van.1964Purchased by the Quainton Railway Society.

1975The first major overhaul started on 13 August 1975.

1987Met Loco No. 1 is loaned to the Mid Hants Railway in September 1987 for the line’s 10th anniversary.

2007Met Loco No. 1 is loaned to the Bluebell Railway in July 2007 as part of the celebration of the completion of their rake of four Metropolitan Chesham vintage coaches.

2008Met Loco No. 1 is loaned to Barrow Hill in August 2008 for their Rail Power 2008 event and to Llangollen Railway for their suburban weekend in October 2008.

One person who has very fond memories of the Metropolitan Steam Locomotive No. 1 is 90-year-old Celia Dunn.

She was a cleaner on the locomotive at Neasden, north west London, for thirteen years from 1950 to 1963.

She told MailOnline: 'We used to have good fun when we were cleaning, especially the interiors.

'There were two to each cart in the afternoon and when you finished your cart, you would help the couple next door to you and carry on until you reached the end of the train.

'We used to have laughs and sing alongs. Sometimes we would tell stories.

'They were happy those days at Neasden.One of the best.

'Perhaps when I was cleaning the windows I used to burst into song myself. I like the Beatles.

'On New Years' night we would gather in the canteen and sing and eat and I would play the piano. At midnight we would sound the hooter (steam trumpet) in the driver's cab - everyone would on all the different lines.'

Mrs Dunn said the train inspector would always check the carriages to see if they were clean enough.

She said: 'He would go through the train after you were finished, run his finger along the top, by the adverts and check for dust.

'If you hadn't done it properly he would tell you off.'

Mrs Dunn met her late husband, Robert, while working on the train.

She added: 'My late husband was a traffic controller at Baker Street.

'I used to have to phone his office every day to let him know what stock we had - and what we wanted back.

'We met, we had a coffee and within 12 months we were married.'

The ground-breaking line had been built and financed by a 
private company, the Metropolitan Railway, to link the mainline stations
at Paddington, Euston and King’s Cross with the business district of 
central London.

The very first underground railway journey took place through the new tunnels of  the 
Metropolitan line between Paddington and Farringdon, which are now part 
of the Circle & Hammersmith Line.

The opening of the railway took 
place only 26 years after Queen Victoria came to the throne and was 
considered a great novelty.

The journey will be recreated on Sunday 13 and 20 January 2013 when a series of special 
trains will be hauled by the newly restored Met Steam Locomotive No. 1  along part of the original route.

No 1 was the last locomotive to be 
built at Neasden in 1898 by the Metropolitan Railway.

It will pull the 
Metropolitan Railway Jubilee Carriage No 353 - the oldest operational 
underground carriage in existence - which has also recently been 
restored with support from the Heritage Lottery Fund, as well as the 
Chesham Shuttle Coaches from the Bluebell Railway.

It is complete with wood and gas light fittings.

Former Metropolitan 
Railway electric Locomotive No. 12 Sarah Siddons will also be part of 
the train.

No. 1 will also run throughout the year across the Metropolitan line network on special occasions.

The original plan was for a 'light steam' simulation - where an electric locomotive did the pushing.

But Transport for London insisted on having a full working locomotive, which burned approximately one tonne of coal for yesterday's journey.

The last regular steam services ended in 1905 as electric alternatives were pioneered in the later Victorian era.
