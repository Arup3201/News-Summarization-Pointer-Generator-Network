Daley Blind has signed for Manchester United to play as a defensive midfielder, according to his former coach Frank de Boer.

The Holland international confirmed a £14million deal to Old Trafford on deadline day where he will be reunited with former national team manager Louis van Gaal.

Van Gaal largely used the 24-year-old as a left-sided defender during Holland's run to the 2014 World Cup semi-finals, but the versatile player has been used in several positions for his previous club Ajax.

De Boer, who has led Ajax to four successive league titles, claims that Blind has his preferred position is as a central holding midfielder.  

'He [Blind] started as a full-back but I think now he prefers to be a controlling midfielder,' De Boer told ITV.

'He'll have two or three options [at United] - either at wing-back or on the left in a central midfield pairing.

'For Daley it's a great transfer. He's been playing for Ajax since he was 10 years old and now he can hopefully show his qualities at United.

'He'll have to get used to the rhythm of the league first, but he's a really quick thinker and nowadays that's very important.'

Blind is expected to make his United debut against QPR on Sunday, where he could be joined by three other summer signings making their bows - Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo and Radamel Falcao.
