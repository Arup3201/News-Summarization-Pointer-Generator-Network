Fernando Torres is excited about the prospect of playing with Cesc Fabregas at Chelsea next season, and welcomes the competition Diego Costa will also bring to the side's attack.

The striker has failed to set Stamford Bridge alight since joining the Blues from Liverpool for £50million in 2011, only managing 20 goals.

But he hopes the arrival of Spain team-mate Fabregas can help him and Chelsea when the new campaign gets under way.

'I wish he could have joined us a couple of years earlier,' Torres told Spanish radio station Onda Cero. 'He is a blessing for strikers, he always looks to find that final key pass, he's the type of player Chelsea don't have.'

Torres' fellow Spain striker Diego Costa is set to follow Fabregas to west London, with the Atletico Madrid man admitting he is on the verge of joining the Blues for a reported £32m.

Costa, whose 36 goals last season fired Atletico to the Primera Division title and the Champions League final, is expected to be Jose Mourinho's first-choice striker next term, but Torres said he will welcome the arrival of his international team-mate.

'People have been saying for some time that Chelsea have signed a striker, and if it's Diego, then it's very welcome,' he added. 'The level of competition at big clubs should always be very high.'
