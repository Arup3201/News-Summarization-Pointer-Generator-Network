Outspoken: John Major said he was appalled that 
'every single sphere of British influence' was dominated by people who 
went to private school

Britain is run by privately-educated elite, former Prime Minister Sir John Major has warned in a dramatic warning about the difficulties for poor children to get on in life.

The Conservative grandee said the dominance of the wealthy and well-educated  in the ‘upper echelons’ of public life was ‘truly shocking’.

His remarks were seen as a thinly-veiled reference to the wealthy backgrounds of David Cameron's government, in contrast to Sir John's own upbringing in a rented flat in Brixton, South London.

It is the second time in a month that Sir John has spoken out about the dangers of out-of-touch well-heeled politicians indifferent to the needs of the poor.

During a speech to the South Norfolk Conservative Association on Friday evening, Sir John said: ‘In every single sphere of
 British influence, the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held 
overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class.

‘To me, from my background, I find that truly shocking.’

Downing Street rejected the criticism, insisting policies to help people get on were more important than the background of politicians.

Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said the PM regularly speaks to Si John.

‘At the heart of this is about the importance of building what the Prime Minister has decribed as an aspiration nation,' the spokesman said.

‘I actually think that what people around their breakfast table in the morning, getting their kids ready for school… what they want to know is the government has the policies to ensure that their kids can fulfil their talents and ambitions. That’s what is the most important thing.’

Sir John blamed Labour for the ‘collapse in social mobility’ and the ‘truly shocking’ inequality in the UK.

He criticised Ed Miliband's ‘absurd mantra to be the one-nation party’, suggesting that ‘they left a Victorian divide between stagnation and aspiration’.

The 70-year-old grew up in a rented flat in Brixton and was educated in a comprehensive school where he attained three O-levels.

Despite his direct criticism of Labour policies during the speech at South Norfolk Conservative Association’s annual dinner, his comments are also likely to prove embarrassing for David Cameron.

The Prime Minister was educated at Eton and went on to study at Oxford University.

Several senior members of the Cabinet, including Chancellor George Osborne and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, were privately educated, as was London Mayor Boris Johnson.

Sir John suggested that British institutions should return to a system whereby ‘sheer hard graft’ can lead to success, rather than having to rely on privilege.

He said: ‘I remember enough of my past to be outraged on behalf of the people abandoned when social mobility is lost.

'Our education system should help children out of the circumstances in which they were born, not lock them into the circumstances in which they were born.

‘We need them to fly as high as their luck, their ability and their sheer hard graft can actually take them. And it isn’t going to happen magically.’

His concerns echo those expressed by Education Secretary Michael Gove – also educated at a State school – who suggested last year that ‘progressive’ education policies had damaged social mobility.

Suggesting that the Government needed to ‘pull together’ to win the next election, Sir John also criticised the Coalition’s push for same-sex marriage.

Sir John, Prime Minister between 1990 and 1997, said: ‘Social mores have moved on from the way in which we were brought up, with the values that we had. They have moved and changed.

‘And that is why issues such as gay marriage have proved so toxic for the Conservative Party.

‘For people like that, who form the bulk of our party and a great deal of our country too, these are difficult issues, these bewildering social changes, and mostly it is my generation and older who are unsettled by these changes.

‘We may be unsettled by them, but David Cameron and his colleagues have no choice but to deal with this new world. They cannot Canute-like order it to go away because it won’t.’

Sir John also said the Tory leadership should pull their punches on Ukip, saying ‘many of the Ukip  supporters are patriotic Britons who fear their country is changing’ and who will come back to the  Tory party.

Warning: Sir John Major said successive governments had ignored the 'poor and near-poor'

Last month Sir John warned wealthy politicians from privileged 
backgrounds have a moral duty not to ‘kick the ladder’ away for those 
struggling to improve their lives.

In a passionate speech standing up for
 the ‘silent have-nots’, Sir John pointedly drew on his own experience 
growing up in poor parts of Brixton.

Speaking to the parliamentary press gallery, Sir John said there were too many people ‘falling behind through no fault of their own’.

He added: ‘They are white, black, Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Jewish – all of them.

‘They work hard, they obey the law, 
they hope for a better future and they live in every single constituency
 up and down the country.

‘And this trend of people falling behind in the modern world is one that we cannot accept.’

He warned it was ‘criminally easy’ to 
overlook these ‘silent citizens’ because they do not ‘make a fuss, they 
just get on with their lives’.

Si John added: ‘They struggle to pay the bills often, they think carefully before having a family holiday.

‘If unemployed they seek work, if employed they work hard to hang on to their jobs. And how do I know about these people?

‘Because I grew up with them. They were my neighbours, the silent have-nots.

‘They are not high-fliers, not 
financially secure. They’re the dignified poor or near-poor and to the 
shame of decades of politicians – and I include myself in this – there 
are still millions and millions of them.’
