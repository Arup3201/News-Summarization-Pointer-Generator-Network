Daniel Ubani is confronted by his victim's sons at a medical conference in Lindau, Germany

A foreign doctor who killed a patient while working in Britain was branded ‘grotesque’ yesterday for taking legal action against one of his victim’s sons because he called him an ‘animal’.

Daniel Ubani was on his first shift in the UK providing out-of-hours cover when he injected David Gray, 70, with ten times the safe amount of pain killer diamorphine.

An inquest later found he was unfamiliar with the drug and had poor English. 

The Nigerian-born medic was struck off by the General Medical Council but was able to continue working in his adopted country of Germany after the authorities there let him off with a nine-month suspended prison sentence and a small fine.

Mr Gray’s furious sons Stuart and Rory, confronted their father’s killer at a medical conference in Lindau, Bavaria, where he was plugging his cosmetic surgery clinic the day after snubbing the GMC hearing.

In dramatic scenes, the brothers called him a ‘charlatan’ and a ‘killer’ and demanded he explain his ‘colossal blunder’.

Shortly before they were thrown out, Rory muttered to his brother that Ubani was an ‘animal’ – something he believes he was unaware of until it was mentioned in legal documents long after the incident.

Ubani, 71, is now suing Rory, who lives in Germany and works for the country’s weather office, for lost earnings.

He is claiming €1,148 for the loss of a speaking fee after leaving the conference in 2010 and €2,250 for legal fees – a total of around £2,700.

The action also includes a demand that Rory will not describe him as an animal in future after he ignored a lawyers letter insisting he confirmed in writing he would not use the word again.

Bizarrely, the case is almost identical to one Ubani brought against the Grays in August 2010.

On that occasion his claim for compensation was thrown out and he had to pay the brothers’ legal costs.

The German court also ruled they could refer to him as a ‘charlatan and a killer’ but not describe him as an ‘animal’. Ubani later lost an appeal at Munich High Court.

Rory, 49, told the Daily Mail: ‘It is grotesque. He has already taken this to court once and lost everything except the bit about calling him an animal. He wasn’t even aware of that until I produced a transcript from a camcorder recording I made at the conference.

‘Four years later his lawyer sent me a letter demanding I promised to pay him a lot of money if I ever called him that again. I am not going to write to him. This is the man who came into my dad’s house and killed him.

‘I don’t understand the case and my lawyer can’t understand it either. It’s an abuse of the legal process. 

‘Ubani’s just trying to extract money from the family of his victim. He seems to think he’s invincible since the German authorities took action that stopped him being prosecuted in the UK.’ 

Stuart Gray, a 54-year-old GP from Worcestershire, added: ‘This guy is obviously morally and ethically corrupt.

‘He killed my father through gross negligence but obviously he is not happy with that and wants to take my brother to court as he claims he missed a meal and payment for a conference. I consider him to be a weasel.’ 

The case is due to be heard on Monday at Lindau District Court, although Rory Gray’s lawyer has requested an adjournment.David Gray’s death in 2008 prompted a review of out-of-hours services,

particularly a loophole which allowed doctors from the EU with poor English to practise here because of rules on the free movement of labour.

Last week new laws were introduced that allow the GMC to withhold a licence if they have concerns about an individual.

The regulator wrote to the Grays congratulating them on their efforts to have the law changed.

Tanja Schubert, its head of European and international affairs, said: ‘We could not have achieved this without your support.’
