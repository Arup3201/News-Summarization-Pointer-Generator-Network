A puppy that was found dumped in the street after all of her hair fell out has been given a wardrobe of jumpers to protect her sensitive skin. 

Peaches was just nine-weeks-old when she was abandoned in the street suffering from a painful skin condition, which caused her to bleed when she tried to relieve herself by scratching. 

But after being rescued by Animal Care in Lancaster, members of the public have taken pity on Staffordshire Bull Terrier Peaches, and provided her with a wardrobe full of jumpers, hoodies and towels to help her on a speedy road to recovery.

Peaches suffers from a painful skin condition and has been given a wardrobe of clothes to protect her from the elements

Peaches was rescued by Animal Care in Lancaster and is on the road to recovery

Diane Lambert, centre manager at Animal Care, said: 'Peaches has got a bigger wardrobe than me! 

'She's a big fan of her pink hoodie, she's becoming quite a doll.'

When Peaches was found, she was so neglected that her nails were falling out. 

After being left by her owners, she was forced to roam the streets and scour for food to survive. 

Members of the public have taken pity on Peaches, and are donating clothes for her to wear until she recovers

It is thought she was left due to her skin condition, which is caused by a mite, which gets into the skin and causes extreme irritation. 

Diane said: 'We believe Peaches was born into a litter which contracted the disease. 

'It's likely the owners were left with a mother and a litter of puppies who all had the skin condition, and rather than simply treating them, they let the animals get to this horrendous state, before dumping at least one of them.

'If she had not been rescued when she did, it's likely Peaches wouldn't have survived. It's an extremely painful condition, especially for a puppy. 

'It's so sad because if her owner had just taken her to a vet when she first picked up the condition, it could have been treated so easily. 

'I have been here 15 years and I have never seen a case as serious as this.'

Peaches was first picked up by Homeless Hounds in Blackburn, where she was due to be put down until Animal Care rescued her. 

Taking her straight into isolation to prevent other dogs picking up the contagious disease, staff at Animal Care began to nurse her back to health by bathing her skin with a specialist shampoo. 'She is being treated with tablets and we have to bathe her everyday,' Diane said. 

'We must wash her with a shampoo which costs £60 a bottle, but it means her hair should grow back within a month.

She has a wardrobe of jumpers and hoodies, including a red Liverpool Football Club jersey

If she hadn't been found when she was, it is likely Peaches would have died from her condition

'We then have to pat her dry with a towel to ensure we don't irritate her skin any further.'

Due to her tender loving care, Peaches is well on the road to recovery and loving her new life. 

Diane said: 'Given everything she has been through, she is so trusting of us. 

'When she came in she looked so miserable but her personality is starting to come out now and she's beginning to behave like a puppy - it's hard to stop her bouncing around! 

'The public have been so kind - they have so far donated more than £700 as well jumpers, toys and treats for Peaches.'

Peaches still requires further treatment including having her skin scraped to allow her condition to completely clear up. 

She will then be taken in by a foster home to 'learn how to be a dog', before being permanently homed. 

Animal Care has set up a Just Giving page for Peaches, where people can donate to help get her back on her feet, here.
