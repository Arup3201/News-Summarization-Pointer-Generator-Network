Florence Crittenton High School in Denver, Colorado, enrolls students aged between 14 and 21 who require parenting assistance

The Florence Crittenton Services of Colorado states that more than 1,000 teenagers become pregnant every year in Denver County

The American Pregnancy Association states that around 469,000 babies are born to teenage mothers across the country each year

A Colorado high school for students who are either pregnant or already a teenage mother is the focus of a new reality series.

Florence Crittenton High School in Denver, which caters for 9th to 12th grade female students, has opened up its classroom doors to a film crew putting together a new TV show.

The show will follow a group of expecting teenagers and mothers from as young as 14 - some even have braces on their teeth - who are able to drop off their children at the school's day care facilities before attending the day's classes.

Grandparent breakfasts, CPR training, dads' clubs and 'raising a reader exchange day' are just some of the calender events on offer at the school.

The school also provides career guidance including the teaching of 'marketable job skills' and other parenting training to teenagers.

Enrollment is open to students aged 14 to 21 and the school is able to care for 170 students each semester.

It attracts 280 students, on average, per year.

The school's website states: 'Students have a choice of how long they would like to attend; they could be a student from one semester to five years' while most students typically 'stay in the program from 18-24 months'.

Class is in session between the hours of 8am to 3.15pm, Monday to Friday, as explored in the new six-partÂ TLC series which premieres on August 12.

The show, in typical TLC style, will aim to showcase the drama experienced by mothers and those teens who are expecting as they juggle parenthood with textbooks.

Londisha, a tenth grader who has been enrolled at the school for eight months, says the experience has offered her a second chance at life.

'I feel it's a way for me to get caught up quicker but still feel like I'm at a regular high school,' the mother-of-one says. 'They support me with my situations that I do have going on. So yeah, my second chance is here.'

The youngster, who is fitted with a mouth full of braces, reveals that just like regular high school, Florence Crittenton has its own cliques.

'I don't really hang out with the pregnant girls,' she says. 'Pregnant girls definitely have a lot of 
hormones. A lot, like, it's scary. You'll walk down the hall and see a 
big fat pregnant girl crying for no reason. It's funny... but it's not funny.'

She adds: 'Pregnant girls get on my nerves. I know I
 probably got on a lot of people's nerves when I was pregnant, just 
crying all over the place.'

She also offers some insight into her life prior to becoming a mother.

'A couple of years ago, I was partying and having fun,' she says. 'And now there's no time for that really. I go to school. He's [her son] had a big impact on my life. Good.'

She also says that attending an all-female school can be overwhelming at times.

'Like, I get tired of looking at the same
 girls every day,' she says. 'I wish I could see some boys but boys aren't that 
important. Well, they are, but they're not THAT important.'

The new series comes after the success of 16 And Pregnant, which was so popular that a spin-off series titled Teen Moms was created.

The Florence Crittenton Services of 
Colorado states that more than 1,000 teenagers become pregnant every year
 in Denver County alone.

The American Pregnancy Association states that around 469,000 babies are born to teenage mothers across the country each year.
