These are the shocking final moments before a 27-year-old camera assistant was killed by a freight train on the set of the biographical film 'Midnight Rider'.

The footage, captured on a camera mounted inside the CSX locomotive, shows Sarah Jones and other crew members trying to flee from the railroad bridge they were filming at in southeast Georgia

But while they and stars, including William Hurt and Wyatt Russell, were running for their lives, the metal bed that was being used as a prop in the movie was still lying across the track.

Seconds later, the bed was struck by the train, killing Miss Jones, who was in her first day of shooting on the film about the Allman Brothers Band singer, Gregg Allman. Six other workers were injured.

'A deadly weapon': But while those involved in the movie were running for their lives, the metal bed (pictured in white) that was being used as a prop in the movie was still lying across the track. It was hit by the train

The video was unveiled by ABC's 20/20 on Friday, more than eight months after the crash on the bridge spanning the Altamaha River, where filmmakers were allegedly shooting without permission.

The footage includes a breakdown of the train's position at various points leading up to the incident. At 26 seconds before impact, the vehicle needed a mile to stop and the engineer blew the whistle loudly.

Twenty-three seconds later, Hurt, Russell and two crew members were spotted running along the 30-foot high trestle toward the train in a bid to make it to safety.

Others could be seen holding their hands over their ears to block out the deafening sound, while some were captured desperately clinging on to the sides of the bridge.

Three seconds on, the train smashed into the bed, which workers had not been able to move off the track in time, turning it into a 'deadly weapon' that 'pushed' Miss Jones into the vehicle.

Speaking to the program, hairstylist Joyce  Gilliard, who suffered an arm injury in the crash, said those involved in the shoot had been told that if a train comes, 'you have 60 seconds to get off the track'.

Fatal: This still - captured by the train's camera- shows the train about to smash into the bed, which workers had not been able to move off the track in time. The bed then hit Miss Jones, 'pushing' her into the train

Fast-paced: The train continues to speed across the track, while Miss Jones, who was in her first day of shooting of the film about the Allman Brothers Band's Gregg Allman, dies. Six other workers were injured

Talented camera assistant: Miss Jones was just 27 years old when she was struck by the train and killed

Referring to Miss Jones's death on February 20, she added: 'At first it was like a quiet, like people were in shock at what happened. I remember hearing somebody say "Oh my gosh, she's dead".' 

Following the fatal crash, Miss Jones's parents, Richard and Elizabeth Jones, from Columbia, South Carolina,  launched a lawsuit against director Randall Miller and others involved in the film.

After carrying out a number of inquiries, investigators determined the filmmakers went onto the railroad bridge  to shoot the footage after CSX Transportation denied them permission.

A letter to location manager Charley Baxter, broadcast in the 30-minute program, seemingly confirms officials' findings, reading: 'Unfortunately CSX is not able to support your request.' 

Last job: During the 20/20 report, photos of Miss Jones's final hours as a camera assistant were also unveiled, including one of her working beside Hurt (pictured), who was lying on the bed on the train tracks

Filming: The bed was being used in a dream sequence that involved Allman lying down and seeing his late brother across the bridge. Above Miss Jones (pictured in green) is seen with actors involved in the film

Meanwhile, Miller is reportedly captured saying "that's not my job" when asked questions on why he didn't know that there could be a train barreling down on his crew.

The Jones's attorney, Jeff Harris, said: 'You don't shoot on a railroad track unless you have permission to be there.'

Miss Gilliard, who is also suing Miller and others involved in the shooting added: 'They wanted to get the shot, so whatever it took to get the shot is what they did. 

'The entire crew was put in a situation where we all had to basically run for our lives.'

Dedicated: During her career, Miss Jones also worked on the set of The Vampire Diaries, where she was described as a 'cosmic sister' by actor Ian Somerhalder. Above, she is pictured with a film camera

On Thursday, Mr Harris said the Joneses have decided to dismiss all claims against Allman - an executive producer of the film based on his life story - after reviewing evidence in the case.

'It is clear that Mr. Allman ... had no involvement in any of the decisions that resulted in Sarah's death,' he said in a statement. 

Allman - who was dismissed alongside two others - was among 10 individuals and eight corporations named as defendants in May when the Joneses filed their lawsuit in Savannah.

The couple is still seeking damages from others, including  Miller, railroad firm CSX Transportation and Rayonier Performance Fibers, which owns the property surrounding the crash site.

Fighting back tears: Speaking to the program, a tearful Miss Gilliard (pictured) said those involved in the deadly shoot had been assembled and told: 'You have 60 seconds to get off the track'

Denied request: A letter to the film's location manager Charley Baxter, broadcast in the  program, reads: 'Unfortunately CSX is not able to support your request' - relating to their request to shoot on the bridge

Miller and three other filmmakers have also been indicted on criminal charges of involuntary manslaughter, a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and trespassing in rural Wayne County where the crash occurred.  

Allman's attorney, David Long-Daniels, said the singer had little involvement with the movie other than licensing the rights to his memoir, 'My Cross to Bear', to the filmmakers.

'We're delighted the Jones family has dismissed us,' Long-Daniels said. 'We remain very sorrowful for the tragedy they have endured with the loss of their daughter.'

The Jones family's attorneys said they also dropped claims against Michael Lehman, an executive producer on the film, and Open Road Films, a film distribution and marketing company.

During the 20/20 report, photos of Miss Jones's final hours as a camera assistant were also unveiled, including one of her working beside Hurt, who was lying on the bed on the train tracks.

The bed was being used in a dream sequence that involved Allman lying down and seeing his late brother across the bridge, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

It also aired a 911 call from the set following the fatal train crash, in which someone is heard requesting an ambulance, saying 'someone got hit by a train'.

During her career, Miss Jones also worked on the set of The Vampire Diaries, where she was described as a 'cosmic sister' by actor Ian Somerhalder.

On Friday, Miller and producer Jody Savin's attorney told ABC that the filmmakers believed they had permission to be on the tracks from Rayonier.

They added: 'They had no reason to believe that anyone would be placed in danger. They will live with the sorrow of Sarah's death for the rest of their lives.'

The attorney's comments followed an earlier prepared statement from Miller and Savin in which they said the crash and Miss Jones's death 'will haunt us forever'.. 

A railroad safety expert also pointed out that the crew had no way of knowing when a freight train might speed down the track because there is no train schedule 'like a major airline might publish'.

Production on 'Midnight Rider' was halted after the crash. The case is ongoing.
