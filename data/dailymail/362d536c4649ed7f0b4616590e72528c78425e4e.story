A grandmother and her four-year-old granddaughter have drowned after they went to a lake to feed the ducks.

Relatives suspect that Laura Zulema Fleming, 59, jumped into the water at Silver Lake, a gated community in Miramar, Florida, on Sunday after her granddaughter Leila  fell in, WSVN reported.

But neither could swim and they both drowned. 

Family members called police around 11pm on Sunday to say the duo were missing. Their bodies were recovered from the water shortly before midnight.

Heartbroken: Relatives comfort each other the day after Laura and Leila were found drowned in the lake

'We saw them bringing out a person with their arms up,' neighbor Andy Casteneda told WSVN. 'Then two or three minutes afterwards, they bring out a baby.'

Autopsies were carried out on Monday and they were both found to have drowned, Miramar police spokeswoman Tania Rues said, the Sun Sentinel reported.

'Unfortunately, it appears they had been deceased for a period of time,' she said. 'Based on accounts from family members, neither the grandmother nor the 4-year-old knew how to swim.'

Fleming had taken her granddaughter out to the water around 7pm on Sunday.

'The information that we gathered from the family is that she was a very doting grandmother, was always with the grandchild and they would go out on occasion,' Rues said. 'It was not something the family thought was unusual for them to do.'

'Doting': Mrs Fleming often took her young granddaughter down to the water to feed the ducks, police said

The youngster lived with her grandmother in the gated community. They shared a home with Leila's father - Laura's son - George Fleming Jr. and her grandfather George Fleming Sr.

Her mother, 23-year-old Ashli Rodriguez, does not live at the address.

Leila's cousin called her 'an adorable, sweet girl' and added that her aunt was 'a very wise woman - very caring, very loving'. 

Miramar Police said no one witnesses the drowning but no foul play was suspected. They continue to investigate, Rue said.
