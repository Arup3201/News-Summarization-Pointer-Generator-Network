Eleven people were killed in separate head on collisions on opposite sides of the country today - including a tragic family of four.

In Tampa, Florida, five men, including four fraternity brothers, lost their lives on a southwest Florida highway early this morning when a suspected drunk driving on the wrong-side of the road smashed into their car.

And in Diamond Bar, California, a family of four perished in massive 100mph pileup after a Camaro driving the wrong way down the freeway slammed head-on into their SUV.

Devastating: A family of four is among the six people killed Sunday morning in a suspected drunk-driving wrong-way crash in California

Hunting for clues: Officials investigate the scene of the horrific accident

The driver of the Camaro, Olivia Culbreath, 21, survived the 4.45am crash and police have indicated that they believe she was intoxicated at the the time of the collision which also caused the death of two of Culbreath's passengers.

Culbreath and another passenger are currently in intensive care at a local hospital and authorities said that two of the victims were ejected from the vehicles in the tragic smash.

The family has not been identified by law enforcement yet.

In Florida, a Ford Expedition heading south in the northbound lanes of Interstate 275 in Tampa collided head-on with a Hyundai Sonata about 2am.

As the Ford burst into flames, killing the unidentified driver, the Hyundai's four young passengers succumbed to their injuries.

Due to extensive fire damage, officials are working to identify the male driver of the Ford who was in his early 20s.

Police have identified the victims in the other car as Jobin Joy Kuriakose, 21, Ankeet Harshad Patel, 22, Imtiyaz 'Jim' Ilias, 20 and Dammie Yesudhas, 21 - all members of University of South Florida's Sigma Beta Rho fraternity.

News of the horrific crash has rocked the close-knit fraternity, with condolences rolling in after Sigma Beta Rho Fraternity, Inc posted this touching message on the Facebook page:

'RIP to four of our brothers from Mu Chapter at USF in Tampa who we lost early this morning from a car crash.

- Dammie Yesudhas, Brother Netflix- Imtiyaz Ilias, Brother Rodnac- Jobin Kuriakose, Brother Ambition- Ankeet Patel, Brother Facetious

'May you rest in peace and remain in remembrance. Please pray for the families.'

In California, Culbreath has spoken to investigators about the accident on the 60 Freeway, police spokesperson Steve Urrea told MailOnline.

Horrifying: Officials investigate the scene of the accident

Alcohol may be to blame: CHP officials say there is evidence of alcohol consumption

Alcohol is suspected to be the primary factor in the accident after Culbreath was observed by law enforcement as acting drunk both at the scene and in the hospital.

However, her blood alcohol content has not been made public.

She suffered a broken femur and a ruptured bladder but is listed in stable condition, sources told NBC Los Angeles.

The coroner’s office told Patch that the deceased were four females and two males – four died at the scene, two at local hospitals.

Their identities have not yet been released, but will be once next-of-kin are notified.

Culbreath has been arrested and charged with counts of vehicular manslaughter and felony DUI, Urrea told MailOnline.

Scene: The driver of the Ford SUV, a male in his 20s, has not yet been identified due to the fire damage to the vehicle

She is in custody but remains at the hospital while recovering from injuries sustained in the crash.

The highway’s westbound lanes remain shut and the investigation is ongoing.

NBC 2 reported the death of young Ilias, a Cypress Lake High School graduate, has devastated the Cypress Lake community.

His former wrestling coach Paul Rothenberg said Ilias was one of the most determined kids on the team.

'Jim was an amazing guy. In everything, school, wrestling, he worked hard, had fun, was a pleasure to be around always entertaining Always wanted to joke,' he said.

The newspaper reported Ilias was only the second wrestler in school history to place in the state tournament twice - coming 6th in 2011 and 4th in 2012.

Yesudhas was an engineering intern at QTM Incorporated and was completing a Bachelor of Science and Mechanical Engineering at USF.

He had completed a Bachelor of Arts last year and was formerly the president of the university's chess club. He also loved playing a variety of sports, including basketball, tennis and volleyball.

Witness Crystal Fountain said she dodged the Ford SUV just moments before the crash.

'It was a car going directly at me in the same lane,' Fountain told Bay News 9.

'It was going straight, it was going fast, all I could think of was the car was on a death mission.'

Fountain said as soon as she swerved out of the way and the Ford SUV sped by, she looked in the side mirror and knew something terrible was about to happen.

'It’s just so painful and hurt that innocent people lost their lives and we still don’t know why or what the reason is,' she said.

Another witness captured the burning vehicle on camera, and she can be heard screaming as she drives past the crash site.

Authorities said they are investigating whether drugs or alcohol played a role in the crash.

The tragic news comes after six people, including a family of four, were killed in a head-on collision in California today.
