Gossip Girl star Kelly Rutherford has lost residential custody of her two children to ex-husband Daniel Giersch, according to a new report.

The 43-year-old actress is said to be 'devastated' after a judge ruled her five-year-old son and three-year-old daughter can remain with their father in France, where he currently resides.

Rutherford was fighting the 37-year-old German businessman in family court to bring her children back to the U.S.

As TMZ reports, Giersch is unable to return to the U.S. because his visa has been revoked as of April this year.

According to the website, the judge ruled Rutherford will be allowed a flexible visitation schedule so that she may spend time with her children when travel and work arrangements allow.

According to the ruling, she will be permitted to see their five-year-old son and three-year-old daughter 50 per cent of the time.

However Rutherford, who married Giersch back in 2006 and divorced him in 2010, plans to appeal the ruling.

Rutherford’s lawyer’s attempted to 
depose Giersch, a German businessman, about his visa, back in 2010 but 
at the time the judge ruled in favor of Giersch, noting that the risk of
him being deported and taking the children to Germany was 'very low.'

It's unclear when Giersch took the children to France and how long Rutherford expected the visit to last.

It makes for another disappointing 
legal row for Rutherford, who in April was sued by a private eye 
claiming he was hired to spy on Giersch.

According to court documents obtained
by TMZ, the actress engaged the services of Edward Banach to spy on her
ex back in April 2010 'in relation to certain issues regarding child 
custody and other matters'.

The website reports the pair went 
through a messy divorce, with issues of 'restraining orders and 
allegations of child endangerment'.

Banach alleges he spent months snooping on Giersch's ex, which left Rutherford with a whopping bill of $86,249.85.

However, he alleges he only got paid $28,214.35, leaving bills of around $58,000 unpaid.

Now, Banach - who was sub-contracted 
through a now-defunct security company - is suing the business along 
with Rutherford to get the remaining $58,000.

According to TMZ, at the height of 
their legal disputes, Rutherford admitted she hired a private 
investigator to prove Giersch  'did not properly secure the pool and 
play areas at his home,' which she alleges endangered the couple's young
son.

The warring pair also previously argued over 
'potty-training' their son and the actress’s ex claimed he was never 
notified of the birth, and instead read about it in online reports.

He put out a statement soon after the
birth that said: 'I was never informed by Kelly about the birth of our 
daughter, nor was I invited to attend.

'In fact, I found out about it 
through Internet reports like everyone else. Although this sickens me, I
am of course overjoyed that our baby was born healthy.

'I would’ve wanted nothing more than 
to hold our newborn daughter for a few moments, and I only seek to 
co-parent both our children responsibly and with love.'

Rutherford’s publicist Jill Fritzo 
countered: 'The doctors advised that no one be in the birthing room; 
[Daniel] was notified when [Helena] was born and was immediately invited
to come see her.'

The Gossip Girl star was previously married to Carlos Tarajano for seven months, before their union dissolved in January 2002.

A representative for the actress has not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment.

Rutherford
saw mainstream success after nearly ten years in showbusiness thanks to
her role as call girl Megan Lewis in television drama Melrose Place  for three years beginning in 1996.

She currently stars in CW hit Gossip Girl as Lily van der Woodsen, the mother of Blake Lively's charmed character, Serena.
