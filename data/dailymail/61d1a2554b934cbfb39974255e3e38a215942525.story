A woman treated for a recurring superbug infection with a stool transplant from an overweight donor rapidly gained weight afterwards, it has emerged.

The female patient then became obese, according to experts who reviewed her case.

Faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is a promising  treatment for relapsing C. difficile infections.

The bacterial infection affects the digestive system, and often those who have been treated with antibiotics.

In severe cases, the infection can cause life-threatening complications.

A woman who underwent a faecal transplant to help cure her recurring C-difficile infections gained more than three stone in the months after the procedure, where stools from an overweight donor were transferred into her gut, in a bid to restore 'good' bacteria (picture is posed by models)

The aim of a faecal transplant is to replace 'good' bacteria in the gut that has been killed or suppressed.

This balances out the 'bad'bacteria, specifically C-difficile, that are overpopulating the colon.

However the new report suggests clinicians should avoid selecting stool donors who are overweight.

And doctors say it raises questions about the role of gut bacteria in metabolism and health.

At the time of the patient's faecal transplant in 2011, her weight was stable at nine-and-a-half stone, and her body mass index (BMI) was a borderline 26 (a healthy BMI is classed as a up to 25). 

Then 32 years old, the woman had always been of 'normal weight', according to the case report. 

The transplant used donor stools from the woman's overweight but otherwise healthy teenage daughter.

It was administered via a colonoscopy to restore a healthy balance of bacteria in the woman's gut, curing her C-diff infection.

But 16 months after the procedure, the woman's weight rose to 12 stone and her BMI increased to 33 - meeting the medical criteria for obesity.

Faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is a procedure where faecal matter, or stools, is collected from a donor.

It is then mixed with saline before being transplanted into a patient by colonoscopy, endoscopy or enema.

The aim is to replace 'good' bacteria in the gut that has been killed or suppressed, usually by the use of antibiotics, leaving 'bad'bacteria, specifically C-difficile, to overpopulate the colon.

The infection can cause complications often resulting in debilitating diarrhoea, which in some cases proves fatal.

The woman's weight gain continued, despite doctors placing her on a medically supervised liquid protein diet and exercise regime.

Sustained efforts to diet and exercise regularly failed to achieve any weight loss.

Three years after her transplant the woman weighed 12-and-a-half stone, and her BMI reached 34.5.

Specialists examining her case said she remains clinically obese today.

Colleen Kelly, from the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University said: 'We're questioning whether there was something in the faecal transplant, whether some of those "good" bacteria we transferred may have had an impact on her metabolism in a negative way.'

The link is supported by past animal studies looking at bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract and weight.

After transferring gut bacteria from obese mice into animals of a normal weight, scientists noted a marked increase in fat.

In light of the woman's case, the authors of the report recommend selecting stool donors who are not overweight.

But they noted the transplant was not the only possible cause of the patient's weight gain.

The woman weighed a stable nine-and-a-half stone before the procedure and had a BMI of 26. But within 176 months her weight rose to 12 stone and BMI to 33 - making her medically obese. Two years after the operation the woman weighed 12-and-a-half stone and her BMI was 34.5 (file picture)

They said in addition to treatment for C-diff, the woman had also been treated with several antibiotics for Helicobacter pylori infection.

Other possible contributing factors in the woman's weight gain include the resolution of her C-diff infection, genetic factors, ageing, and stress related to illness.

However, as noted, the patient had never been overweight before.

Ana Weil and Elizabeth Hohmann, of Massachusetts General Hospital, said the case raises many questions about donor selection and highlights the importance of studying long-term outcomes of faecal transplants.

In a related editorial, they said: 'Careful study of FMT will advance knowledge about safe manipulation of the gut microbiota.

'Ultimately, of course, it is hoped that FMT studies will lead to identification of defined mixtures of beneficial bacteria that can be cultured, manufactured, and administered to improve human health.' 

The report was published in the new journal Open Forum Infectious Diseases.
