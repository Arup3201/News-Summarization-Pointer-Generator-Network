Teenage thugs savagely beat a grandfather, breaking his nose and leaving him with two black eyes, after he remonstrated with them for over-turning bins in his local park.

Kyle Spencer, 19, and a 17 year-old who can not be named for legal reasons were sentenced to three years detention after they brutally beat and kicked Mark Earnshaw.

The 51-year-old accounts manager was punched repeatedly and repeatedly kicked by the yobs, suffering two black eyes, a broken nose, a badly-bruised jaw and a gaping wound to the side of his face after his teeth tore through his cheek during the beating.

Brutal: Mark Earnshaw was punched repeatedly and repeatedly kicked by two yobs, suffering two black eyes, a broken nose, after he remonstrated with them for over-turning bins in his local park

Injuries: The 51-year-old account manager also suffered a badly bruised jaw and a gaping wound to the side of his face after his teeth tore through his cheek during the beating

He has permanent damage to his right eye and scars to his face, while the vision in one of his eyes is still impaired following the attack near his home in Anchorsholme, Blackpool, Lancashire in March last year.

Mr Earnshaw was celebrating becoming a grandfather to twins when he was dropped off at home by taxi following a birthday party at a nearby social club.

As he was getting ready for bed sat around 2am he hearing smashing noises and went outside to investigate.

Bins had been overturned at the entrance 
to Anchorsholme Park opposite and Mr Earnshaw feared vandals were about 
to damage flower beds and the bowling green, as well as the children’s 
play area.

Sentenced: Kyle Spencer, 19, (pictured) and a 17-year-old who can not be named for legal reasons, was sentenced to three years detention for the attack on Mr Earnshaw.

'I had gone to the surprise birthday party alone because my wife went to the hospital as my stepdaughter was going into labour with twins,' he said.

'It was really dark at that time and I assumed nobody was about, so was surprised when I heard a voice - it said "what are you staring at?" Two teenagers suddenly appeared out of the darkness and they seemed quite agitated.

'I told them I didn’t want any trouble, that I’d had a good night and that I was looking forward to going to bed. I thought that was the end of it, but as I was getting ready for bed I heard a lot of noise coming from the park.

'I love that park and go there a lot with my dog Cooper and my granddaughter, so it really annoyed me that they were vandalising it. I pulled on a pair of jeans and trainers and headed out.'

He went out to talk to the youths, but when they became very abusive and angry he turned to walk away. As he did so he felt a great heavy blow from behind.

“They came out of nowhere saying they were doing it because they had nothing else to do, then one of them squared up to me saying, ‘go on touch me’ over and over again and that’s when I really started to panic,' he said.

'The best thing I thought to do was just a walk off, but I must have taken about three steps when I felt a hard thump from behind.

'He hit me again and my glasses went onto the floor. I could hardly see where they had landed so bent down to pick them up.

'They started punching and kicking me - I just thought to myself I had to stay on my feet, it was my only chance otherwise they would knock me into a coma.

'I heard my nose crack twice, the pain was unbelievable. Blood was streaming down my face, it was just pouring out. My right eye was bleeding too and I could feel it closing up.

Suffering: Mr Earnshaw has permanent damage to his right eye and scars to his face, while the vision in one of his eyes is still impaired following the attack near his home

Wary: Mr Earnshaw welcomed the sentencing, but said that in the future he would not intervene should a similar situation occur in the future

'I was bent over trying to fend them off, shouting, "I’ve had enough, leave me alone", but it just carried on.'

Mr Earnshaw eventually escaped and ran back into the safety of his home, but he was followed and the same two yobs began smashing up his neighbour’s car.

He said: 'I yelled for my wife to call the police and headed straight for the shower to wash all of the blood off. Then my neighbour was at the door saying the lads kicked in the doors of his car .

'They obviously thought I’d gone into that house - I couldn’t believe beating me up wasn’t enough for them. I just kept thinking, that could have been my head.'

Mr Earnshaw was taken to Blackpool Victoria hospital where he was x-rayed and then transferred for special surgery at Preston Royal Hospital to stich up the hole in his cheek.

'You could have stuck your little finger through my cheek, I couldn’t believe it when I looked in the mirror, I was a mess.

'It frustrates me that these thugs have ruined what was supposed to be a happy time in our lives - the birth of our two grandsons who were born earlier that evening.'

Both Spencer and the 17-year-old admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent at Preston Crown Court.

The younger boy also admitted criminal damage and both were sentenced to three years detention.

Mr Earnshaw welcomed the sentencing, but said that in the future he would not intervene should a similar situation occur in the future as he did not want to suffer the same fate as tragic Garry Newlove, who was kicked to death as he confronted youths damaging his wife’s car outside their home in Warrington, Cheshire in 2007.

'I won’t bother tackling these yobbos next time - I don’t want to be another Garry Newlove,' said Mr Earnshaw, who is married to Angela, 49, a receptionist.

'I’m pleased these lads have gone to jail so they can reflect on what they have done but unfortunately now I would let these people get on with it next time if I saw the getting up to no good.

'It’s not worth risking my own life tackling these people in future.

'Obviously I don’t like the senseless damage of things and it annoys me people get a kick out of smashing up the park.

'Then you then hear about what happens to other people like Garry Newlove who lost his life doing something like I did - and I think that could have been me.

'If I’d fallen to the ground unconscious and been beaten some more, my wife may have been going to a funeral. I went out without really thinking about the consequences.'

Detective Constable Alan Quanbrough of Lancashire Police said after the hearing: 'This was a senseless and sustained attack on the victim, who received life-changing injuries.

'He was simply acting in the interests of his local community, and so, we welcome the court’s decision to imprison Spencer and his fellow attacker.'
