The world's first 
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier ended its remarkable career at sea on 
Sunday when it pulled into its home port for the final time after 
participating in every major conflict since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 
1962.

The USS Enterprise began shutting down 
its eight nuclear reactors almost as soon as it arrived at its pier at 
Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia, where thousands of cheering family 
members and friends welcomed the ship home from its 25th and final 
deployment after nearly eight months at sea.

'It's
exceptionally emotional and exceptionally satisfying,' Rear Adm. Ted 
Carter, commander of the Enterprise Strike Group, said as Naval Station 
Norfolk came into view and his sailors manned the rails.

The ship will never move on
its own power again and will eventually be scrapped in Washington 
state, making its final voyage a sentimental one for those who have 
sailed aboard 'The Big E'.

Copies of the 
ship's daily newspaper, The Shuttle, were in short supply as sailors 
looked for memorabilia to take with them.

Countless personal photos were
taken by sailors throughout the ship as it approached shore.

However,
Adm. Carter is the first to say that the Enterprise's final deployment was 
anything but a sentimental victory lap.

Epic: The gargantuan ship's fighter planes flew more than 2,200 combat sorties and dropped 56 bombs in Afghanistan during her service

The ships' fighter planes flew 
more than 2,200 combat sorties and dropped 56 bombs in Afghanistan while
supporting U.S. and international ground troops.

In a show of force to 
Iran, the ship also passed through the strategic Strait of Hormuz ten 
times, a figure that Carter said is more than double the typical amount.

The U.S. Navy has had a boat named Enterprise since the American Revolutionary War. The first Enterprise belonged to the British before it was seized by America in 1775.

Seven boats carried the name Enterprise until in 1954, Congress agreed to build the world’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.

Eight nuclear reactors were needed to power the giant ship - a new but dangerous approach because it required reactors to be harnessed together which had never been done before.

Enterprise was built with 60,000 tons of steel; 1,500 tons of aluminium; 230 miles of pipe and 1,700 tons of welding rods. More than 800 companies provided materials for the boat which was worked on by 900 engineers. 

Four years later, the ship, nicknamed The Big E, was set to launch and in October 1962, saw its first international action during the Cuban Missile Crisis. A blockade was placed on October 24 until after a tense four days, Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev agreed to dismantle nuclear arms in Cuba.

Following the 9/11 attacks, Enterprise headed to the North Arabian Sea to take a central role in Operation Enduring Freedom.

After returning home to Norfolk, Virginia to have extensive repairs, Enterprise deployed for the 21st time in January 2011 and carried out multiple anti-piracy missions. 

November 25, 2011 marked the remarkable boat's 50th anniversary, making it the oldest ship on duty in the U.S. fleet.

The
Enterprise has been a frequent traveler to the Middle East over its 
career.

It was the first nuclear-powered carrier to transit through the 
Suez Canal in 1986, and it was the first carrier to respond following 
the 9/11 attacks, changing course overnight to head to the Arabian 
Sea.

An entire room on the ship serves as a 
museum to its history, which includes a large photo of the burning Twin 
Towers placed in a timeline that wraps around a wall.

The
Navy will officially deactivate the Enterprise on December 1, but it will 
take several more years for it to be decommissioned as its reactors are 
taken out.

About 15,000 people are expected to attend the deactivation 
ceremony, which will be its last public ceremony after several days of 
tours for former crew members.

Those who have 
served on the ship have a unique camaraderie.

It is the second-oldest 
ship in the Navy after the USS Constitution, and its age has frequently 
shown. Sailors who work on the Enterprise have a saying: 'There's tough,
then there's Enterprise tough.'

Things frequently break down, and spare parts for a ship that's the only one in its class aren't made anymore.

'She's
just old, so you got to work around her,' said Petty Officer 2nd Class 
Danielle Almaraz, an electronic technician.

'We have to make our own 
parts sometimes because it just doesn't exist.'

Those
deployed on the Enterprise knew life wouldn't be easy at sea, a fact 
highlighted last year when former commanding officer Capt. Owen Honors 
was fired for airing raunchy videos that he said were intended to boost 
morale.

During a hearing in which Honors was trying to avoid being 
kicked out of the Navy, he and his lawyers frequently referenced the 
difficult conditions on board.

Honors was found to have committed 
misconduct, but ultimately allowed to stay in the service. He is 
retiring in April.

Some of the ship's original
crew members from 51 years ago - known as plank owners - were among the 
1,500 civilians who joined the Enterprise for its last two days at sea, 
known as a Tiger Cruise.

'This is the end of 
an era that I helped start, so I was just honored that the captain 
invited me on board. There's no way I'd turn that down,' said original 
crew member Ray Godfrey of Colorado Springs, Colo.

The
aircraft carrier is the eighth U.S. ship to bear the name Enterprise, 
with the first one being confiscated from the British by Benedict Arnold
in 1775.

Current sailors and alumni like Godfrey are lobbying to have a
future carrier also named Enterprise.

The ship's crew created a time 
capsule to be passed along to each Navy secretary until a new ship 
carries its name.

Other memorabilia on the 
ship, such as a pair of black fuzzy dice that hang in the ship's tower 
that were donated by the film crew of the 1986 Hollywood blockbuster 
movie 'Top Gun,' will be stored by the Naval History and Heritage 
Command.
