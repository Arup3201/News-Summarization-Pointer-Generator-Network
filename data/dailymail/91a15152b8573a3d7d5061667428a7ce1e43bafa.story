Two schoolboys are being questioned today over the death of a teenage footballer who was the best friend of X Factor star Frankie Cocozza.

The youngsters, both aged 14, are accused of being involved in a fight on Saturday night which ended with Connor Saunders, 19, being punched to the ground.

Connor, who frequently accompanied Mr Cocozza as he travelled the country, suffered serious head injuries and was taken to hospital. He never recovered consciousness and died a few hours later.

A 13-year-old also arrested over the death of the plasterer from Brighton was today bailed.

A Sussex Police spokeswoman said: 'Two 14-year-old boys remain in custody today on suspicion of murder.

'A 13-year-old boy, who was also 
arrested on suspicion of murder, has been released on bail until May 8 
pending further inquiries.'

Last night, Connor was described as a ‘wonderful person’ with a ‘lovely nature’.

His distraught friend Frankie pulled out of a nightclub appearance on 
Saturday night due to ‘personal circumstances’. Last night he tweeted: 
‘My life will never be the same.’

The controversial singer, who was kicked off the ITV series last year 
after reportedly boasting about taking cocaine and was later runner-up 
in Celebrity Big Brother, posted a series of pictures on his Twitter 
page of the victim at Disney World in Florida.

A spokesman said: ‘Frankie is understandably grieving. He was in Glasgow when he found out and has since returned home.

‘Connor was a very close family friend.’

According to friends on Twitter, plasterer Connor was best friends with Frankie, who was voted off last year's X Factor and starred in Celebrity Big Brother

It was unclear last night what triggered the fight outside a Tesco store in Rottingdean, near Brighton, at 10.30pm.

Police said the victim was with two 19-year-old friends, and are now hoping to recover CCTV images of the incident.

Three younger boys were also involved.

Detective Chief Inspector Nick May said: ‘We believe that an altercation took place between two groups.

‘Members of each group are known to 
each other and during the incident the victim was punched to the head, 
causing him to fall to the floor.

‘There
has been some speculation locally that a weapon was involved, but there
is no indication from the information we have that this was the case.’

Peacehaven and Telscombe Football Club paid tribute to the youth player, who was in the same Under-18s squad as Frankie Cocozza.

The victim’s father Shaun, who is the club’s first team manager, and his wife Darran, the managing director of a cake firm, were too upset to speak, but the club released this statement: ‘It was with incredible sadness we learned this morning that Connor Saunders, 19, had died following an attack yesterday evening.

‘We have all lost a wonderful person 
and talented footballer. Connor had many friends because of his lovely 
nature and his loss is tragic to everyone connected to our club, his 
friends and family.

‘The club is currently in a state of 
shock. Our condolences go to all the family and we would ask that their 
privacy be respected at this difficult time.

‘RIP Connor, we all loved you and you will never be forgotten.’

On Connor’s profile on the club website, when he was asked who he would 
like to be stuck on a desert island with, he replied: ‘My Dad’.

The teenager, who had represented Sussex Under-18s, was an avid Chelsea FC fan and considered John Terry his hero.

Flowers were left at the scene of the tragedy. The card on one bouquet 
read: ‘My darling Connor. Loved you as a son and brother. Will miss you 
every day. Sleep well sweetheart.’

Another message said: ‘May you rest now big man. Gone much too soon. All
the memories will remain. The captain. Thoughts with your family.’

Treatment: Connor was taken to Royal Sussex County Hospital (pictured) with life-threatening head injuries

Mr Cocozza’s Twitter page was flooded with tributes to his friend.The 
victim’s uncle Jamie Denyer said: ‘My nephew, my world, my soulmate, my 
idol, my hero and my heart!!! My baby boy has been taken! Xxx You walked
as an angel on earth, now you have your wings . . . fly for me baby 
boy!’

Connor’s cousin LukeTerry posted on his Facebook page: ‘Love you mate – proud to be your cousin’.

Another relative, Sue Saunders, wrote: ‘Our hearts are with Shaun and 
Darran and family in their time of heartbreak and grief. God bless you, 
dear Connor.’
