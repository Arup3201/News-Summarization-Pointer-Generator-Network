Tim Yeo, chairman of the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, has received well over £400,000 from green energy firms since 2009

The Mail on Sunday’s investigation shows how MPs, Lords and lobbyists who benefit from green policies also advise the Government on how those policies ought to operate.

The result is that the debate over measures of questionable value but enormous cost has been almost silenced.

Only three MPs voted against the 2008 Climate Change Act, whose legally binding emissions targets make it the most radical piece of economic legislation in recent history.

The present Energy Bill – which will increase renewable energy subsidies to new, eyewatering heights – is backed by all the main parties.

Behind this apparent unanimity lies an extraordinary blurring of the boundaries which normally exist between business, politics, academics and campaigners.

Top civil servants frequently work one year for the Government and the next for lobbyists, trying to influence their former colleagues.

MPs who play major role in energy debates - but are in the pay of green companies

Lord Oxburgh has directorships with Green Energy Options Ltd and clean energy firm 2OC - which he declared. But he failed to reveal his role with another green firm, the Real Asset Energy Fund

The conflicted House of Lords... where peers don't have to state how much they are paid

Lobbyists who bid for green funds - but advise ministers on green policyOne of most influential green lobby groups is E3G – Third Generation Environmentalists.

Its London branch and its offshoot Transform UK first conceived and then successfully lobbied for the Green Investment Bank, now spending £3.8 billion of taxpayers’ money, much of it to fund offshore wind – yet another subsidy on top of the levies on bills.

Its leadership is the Who’s Who of ecocrats. Chief executive Nick Mabey was responsible for energy in Tony Blair’s No 10 strategy unit; at E3G he replaced John Ashton, who left to become the UK’s chief climate negotiator, serving three successive Foreign Secretaries, Labour and Coalition. He is back at E3G as a ‘founding director’.

James Cameron, chairman of Climate Change Capital, advises the Treasury and was a member of the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Group until last year. He was a member of the commission which set up the Green Investment Bank

The specialist green private equity funds... that are very well connectedSpecialist green private equity funds also have a huge web of links.

For example, James Cameron, chairman of Climate Change Capital, advises the Treasury and was a member of the Prime Minister’s Business Advisory Group until last year. He was a member of the commission which set up the Green Investment Bank.

Cameron is on the board of Oxford University’s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment.

There his former Climate Change Capital colleague Ben Caldecott directs the Stranded Assets Programme – an academic project aiming to prove that fossil fuel reserves will have to be left in the ground in order to save the planet, currently a growing demand from green campaigns.

Caldecott moonlights as head of government advisory – in other words lobbying – at Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

While he was still at Climate Change Capital, he worked on secondment at DECC and as a climate policy adviser for the Conservative Party.

The scope of this green elite makes airing objections almost impossible.

Last week, questioned at the Commons Energy Select Committee, even Energy Secretary and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey admitted that Britain’s green policies had increased global CO2 emissions – because by increasing the price of energy, they have driven jobs to countries like China, which use coal heavily and have no binding emissions limits.

‘It is certainly arguable that our carbon footprint is bigger,’ he said.

Tim Yeo, chairman of the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, has received well over £400,000 from green energy firms since 2009.

Barry Gardiner, a Labour member of Yeo’s committee, has received nearly £60,000 since 2008 from Globe International – an international group chaired by Lord Deben, who is also chair of the Fovernment Climate Change Committee (CCC). Globe campaigns to get national parliaments to pass green laws.

@highlight

Charles Hendry was Energy Minister until 2012. He is chairman of Forewinds, which is planning the world’s biggest offshore windfarm. This role was vacated by Deben when he became chairman of the CCC. For this Hendry is paid £48,000, plus £18,000 from Atlantic Supergrid, which wants to lay a high-voltage cable between Britain and Iceland. In all, he is raking in £66,000 a year, more than his MP’s salary.

Lord Oxburgh moved the amendment to the Energy Bill which sought to impose the 2030 carbon limit that will cut CO2 emissions from electric power by 90 per cent. He has directorships with Green Energy Options Ltd and clean energy firm 2OC – which he declared. But he failed to reveal his role with another green firm, the Real Asset Energy Fund. This has led to an investigation by the Lords Commissioner for Standards. Oxburgh also advises Climate Change Capital, one of the biggest green investment firms.

Lord Maclennan of Rogart is chairman of renewable energy firm Inwatur. Together with Lord Lewis and Lord Cameron of Dillington, he was one of three co-authors of a report in May by the Lords EU Committee demanding bigger increases in low-carbon spending who declared interests in renewables.

Few environmentalists have had careers as prodigious as E3G’s chairman, Tom Burke – inventor of the slogan ‘green growth’. Having been executive director of Friends Of The Earth and director of the Green Alliance, he moved into Government, as special adviser to three Environment Secretaries, and then into business, as a green adviser to BP and Rio Tinto. Remarkably he is now also the senior climate change adviser to the Foreign Office.

@highlight

E3G’s funders reflect its chairman’s diverse interests. They include four Government departments: those for International Development, the Environment, DECC and the Foreign Office – which means taxpayers are funding a lobby group whose actions make them poorer. E3G also gets money from Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund.

Another powerful lobby is Renewable UK. Maf Smith, its deputy chief executive, previously worked at DECC on changes to renewable subsidies enshrined in the Energy Bill.
