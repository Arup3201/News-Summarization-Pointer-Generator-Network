The IMF was yesterday forced to admit it had been wrong to criticise George Osborne over his austerity programme.

Last year the Fund said the Chancellor’s cuts in public spending were acting as a ‘drag on growth’ – adding that the UK was a long way from recovery.

But yesterday chief Christine Lagarde said the IMF had ‘underestimated the growth of the economy’ and the UK would actually be the fastest-growing economy in the advanced world in 2014.

Miss Lagarde said: ‘I’m happy to come back yet again and say clearly we underestimated the growth of the UK economy in our growth forecast a year ago.

‘The only consolation I would have is that we are not alone, and I think that pretty much all forecasters at the time had the same underestimation of the success of the rebuilding of confidence.’

Last year, the IMF caused consternation in the Treasury when asserting that Government cuts were harming the prospects for the economy. It also warned that Britain was ‘still a long way from a strong and sustainable recovery’.

But over the past year the economy has recovered and the IMF has since upgraded forecasts four times in a row.

Support: Mr Osborne, pictured with Miss Lagarde, said the International Monetary Fund had given 'unequivocal support to our economic plan', adding: 'The British economy is firing on all cylinders'

The organisation’s annual health check for 2014 said the British economy will probably grow by 2.9 per cent this year and declared the latest plans to strengthen public finances would not ‘put an undue drag on growth’.

Mr Osborne said the IMF had given ‘unequivocal support to our economic plan’, adding: ‘The British economy is firing on all cylinders.’
