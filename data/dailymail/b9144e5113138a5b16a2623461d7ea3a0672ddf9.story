Marina Litvinenko (pictured today outside the Royal Courts of Justice) wife of spy Alexander Litvinenko, said Britain and Russia are conspiring to shut down his inquest

David Cameron is plotting with the Kremlin to ‘shut down’ the inquest into the death of poisoned former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko in a ‘stain on British justice’, it was claimed yesterday.

The Government is ‘dancing to the Russian tarantella’ by conspiring with Moscow to hush up the assassination, a pre-inquest hearing was told.

Both countries wanted ‘to keep a lid on the truth’ to preserve trade deals worth millions of pounds, said a lawyer representing Mr Litvinenko’s widow, Marina.

Media organisations, including the Daily Mail, are fighting the Government’s bid to withhold evidence from the inquest.

Ben Emmerson QC said: ‘This has all the hallmarks of a situation which is shaping up to be a stain on British justice, with the British government deliberately covering up evidence.’

Foreign Secretary William Hague, who oversees the work of MI6, has signed a public interest immunity (PII) certificate to censor certain details of the case.

Coroner Sir Robert Owen must now decide on whether to hold part of the inquest in secret.

Mr Litvinenko, said to have been a triple agent on the payroll of MI6 and the Spanish secret service, was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair in 2006.

He died in a London hospital three weeks later.

His widow says he was assassinated on the orders of the Kremlin, and the prime suspects are former KGB agents Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun.

They both deny involvement. The Crown Prosecution Service wants to charge Lugovoy, but Russia refuses to extradite him.

At yesterday’s hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Mr Hague’s lawyer said he had no choice but to suppress information in the case as disclosure ‘would pose a real risk of serious harm to the public interest’.

The nature of the ‘sensitive’ evidence has not been revealed. But Mr Emmerson said the secrecy bid risked the accusation of a cover-up ‘orchestrated by the Kremlin’ in cahoots with Whitehall.

William Hague has tried to exclude sensitive details relating to former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko's ties to MI6, because they could pose a 'risk of serious harm to the public'

‘It is absolutely crucial that the 
outcome of this hearing is to scotch once and for all any suggestion 
that it is because David Cameron is trying to promote trade with Russia 
that he is trying to close down this inquest,’ he said.

‘If the material shows the Russian 
state murdered Mr Litvinenko, then obviously that’s not going to be very
helpful in terms of relations with Russia.

‘The British government, like the 
Russian government, is conspiring to get this inquest closed down in 
exchange for substantial trade interests which we know Mr Cameron is 
pursuing.’

Referring to the Prime Minister 
putting his arm on the shoulder of Russian President Vladimir Putin 
during the London 2012 Olympics, he said: ‘One has to ask what is going 
on.’

Likening the situation to a folk 
dance, he added: ‘We cannot allow Her Majesty’s Government, by misusing 
the PII system, to use this inquest to dance to the Russian tarantella.’

Mr Emmerson called on the Government 
to provide more detail on the information it wanted to withhold, to 
avoid the ‘frightening prospect’ of proceedings being ‘suborned to the 
Russian Federation’.

Mr Litvinenko’s death in November 2006 plunged Anglo-Russian diplomatic relations into deep freeze.

A fugitive from the Putin regime, the 
43-year-old had for several years been ‘in the employ’ of MI6, with the 
Spanish secret service also bankrolling his espionage activities at 
MI6’s behest, the court heard. His widow believes the Government failed 
to protect her husband. The inquest was due to begin on May 1, but is 
likely to be delayed because of the arguments over secrecy.

‘The British government’s position is 
untenable,’ Mr Emmerson said. ‘They have no right to say to an 
independent judiciary, “You may not investigate these issues”. That 
happens in Russia, for sure.’

He warned the coroner that he should not 
allow the process to be ‘bogged down by the Government’s attempts to 
keep a lid on the truth’.

Mrs Litvinenko, who listened intently 
throughout proceedings, was ‘extremely disappointed’ by the possible 
setback, Mr Emmerson said.

He painted a ‘disastrous’ scenario in 
which the coroner might be shown the ‘sensitive’ evidence in the case, 
and find that although it established the guilt of the Russian state in 
the murder, he would be unable to use it in his conclusion of how Mr 
Litvinenko died because of the secrecy orders.

Alex Bailin QC, for the media, called 
Mr Hague’s PII claim ‘extraordinarily broad’. The Government has 
‘neither confirmed nor denied’ that Mr Litvinenko was an MI6 spy.

Sir Robert is expected to announce 
today whether the Government must shed light on the nature of the 
evidence it aims to conceal.
