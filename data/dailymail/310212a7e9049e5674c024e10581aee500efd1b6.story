His foreign secretary said last week that the only way to revive Britain's flagging economy was to work harder.

But it appears William Hague's blunt words may not apply to David Cameron who found time to go home and change into jeans before whisking his wife out for a swanky meal last night.

With thoughts of the recession, the euro meltdown and LOL-gate placed firmly to one side 'call me Dave' seemed determined to enjoy 'date night' at Oslo Court in north London.

With its salmon-pink decor and retro puddings, critics say the French restaurant is like stepping back into the 1970s .

That decade was dogged by strikes and economic decline too, which may explain why Mr Cameron chose to dine at Oslo Court instead of his regular haunts in upmarket Kensington.

According to a source, the Camerons had been celebrating a family birthday at the restaurant. After tucking into half a dozen oysters and the veal chop the Prime Minister is thought to have eaten a slice of birthday cake before heading home.

In a recent interview he explained how his weekly date night with his wife was important for maintaining a healthy marriage.

But the only way to bring colour back into the economy's cheeks after the UK plunged into its first double-dip recession since 1975 is hard work, according to Mr Hague.

Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph, he delivered a hammer blow to the country's bosses saying they should stop complaining and get on with reviving economy.

With its salmon-pink decor and tempting dessert trolley, French restaurant Oslo Court has changed little since opening its doors in 1970.

It attracts an older, loyal clientele who wolf down bulging glasses of lobster cocktail and whole globe artichokes.

David Cameron last night dined on half a dozen oysters and veal chop, according to a source. But the restaurant in north London also serves up classic beef Wellington, steak, Chateaubriand and is well known for its fresh fish and seafood.

The dinner menu is a fixed price of £42.50 with some dishes carrying a small surcharge, allowing you to splash out on a nice bottle of plonk. A bottle of the Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru will set you back £199.

Puds come courtesy of Egyptian waiter Neil who wheels out his dessert trolley groaning with lemon meringue and tarts in every colour.

Current owner Antonio 'Tony' Sanchez - who is 'sadly not French but Spanish' - says he's well used to seeing famous faces in the restaurant.

'Alan Sugar was in last week and we've had Joan Collins. Everyone comes here,' Mr Sanchez told the MailOnline before adding that bar Mr Cameron he hadn't seen many Cabinet members for a while.

Mr Hague may be glad to hear it.

'I think they should be getting on with the task of creating more of those jobs and more of those exports, rather than complaining about it,' he said.

Asked if his comments could be compared to Lord Norman Tebbit's 'on your bike' message to the unemployed in the 1980s, Mr Hague said: 'It's more than that. It's get on the plane, go and sell things overseas, go and study overseas.

'It's much more than getting on the bike, the bike didn't go that far.'

His comments are a direct riposte to business leaders, including chief executive of Sainsbury's Justin King, who criticised the lack of measures for economic growth in the Queen's Speech last week.

Mr Hague, a former comprehensive schoolboy from Yorkshire whose parents manufactured soft drinks, is seen as the best person to deliver the tough message, rather than David Cameron or George Osborne, who have been criticised for their privileged backgrounds.

But Mr Cameron's privileged background does not appear to have influenced his sartorial choices.

In a classic Breton top, stone-coloured jacket and navy trousers, his wife look her usual chic self.

But with his shiny 'dad' anorak and pointy work shoes, 'call me Dave' looked ready for pie and mash down the local boozer rather than a lobster cocktail in plush surroundings.

In a recent interview the Prime Minister described himself as a 'romantic' and revealed that he tries to take his wife out for dinner on Valentine's Day - if he remembers to book a table early enough.

He also revealed he and his wife have a couple of favourite Italian restaurants in upmarket Kensington, west London.

Mr Cameron's image took yet another battering earlier this week when he revealed that The Dark Side Of The Moon, by Pink Floyd was his favourite album.

Already hounded for being ‘out of touch’ during the economic crisis, critics pointed out that the album appears a fitting choice, featuring tracks including Us And Them, and Money.

Labour leader Ed Miliband also delivered a hammer blow during the Queen's speech at the State Opening of Parliament last week. He said: 'In two years, this prime minister has gone from David Cameron to David Brent.'
