The mother of Baby P could walk free from prison within days after serving just six years for a crime that horrified a nation.

Tracey Connelly, who allowed her infant son Peter to be tortured to death by her boyfriend, may be set free this week as experts believe she poses ‘no danger to the public’.

A parole board panel is considering fresh evidence about the 32-year-old after her parole hearing was adjourned in July for further reports.

Sources said the panellists had been 
conferring over the weekend and a decision is expected within the next 
couple of  days, which could see Connelly released from prison the same 
day.

She was branded ‘manipulative, self-centred and calculating’ during her trial in the Old Bailey.

Assessments
 by psychologists and probation officers now suggest that she poses no 
threat to public safety, even though she was still found to be 
manipulative following the expert examinations.

It is understood that she has shown remorse for her horrific crimes, which is crucial to her plea for freedom.

Let out: Connelly has left Low Newton jail (pictured) in Brasside, County Durham and was released after five years there for allowing her son's death

Connelly
 was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing nothing while 
her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend Steven Barker and 
his paedophile brother Jason Owen.

Peter
 was just 17 months  old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered 
cot at  his mother’s north London flat, after suffering a catalogue of 
injuries, including a  broken back.

With
 her time on remand following her arrest in 2007, Connelly has served 
longer than the five-year minimum tariff handed down at the  Old Bailey 
by judge Stephen Kramer QC, which means  she could apply to the  Parole 
Board.

A source said yesterday that the board did not require a further hearing and a decision will be announced soon.

Connelly
 could be out less than 24 hours after her release is approved, but a 
shortage  of suitable bail hostel places may keep her in jail a few  
days longer. She is currently being held at Low Newton jail near Durham.

News of her possible freedom has been met with horror by Baby Peter’s grandmother Mary O’Connor, 63.

Indefinite sentences: Tracey Connelly's boyfriend Steven Barker (left) and his paedophile brother Jason Owen (right) were both convicted of causing or allowing Peter's death

Criticised: Sharon Shoesmith, the former children's services chief in Haringey, waged a long battle to clear herself of any personal responsibility for the tragedy

‘She
 should never come out,’ she said. ‘But even if she does I won’t be 
seeing her again, she’s out of my life. She wants me to move to Kent 
with her. But I said no.’

Jason Owen was freed on licence in 2011 after serving half his six-year sentence for causing or allowing Peter Connelly to die.

But
 the 41-year-old was returned to prison in April this year after being 
caught in an area from which he had been banned under the conditions of 
his parole.

Baby P suffered 
50 injuries before he died on August 3, 2007. The attacks took place 
while Owen, a convicted arsonist, crack addict and National Front 
member, was lodging with Barker and Connelly.

The
 case provoked a national scandal after it emerged that social workers, 
police and doctors missed a series of warning signs that could have 
saved the child’s life.

Social workers considered his care to be ‘a routine, low-risk case’.

Connelly was described as ‘without much conscience’.

She denied knowing who injured the 17-month-old but admitted causing or allowing the death of a child.

Barker was given an indefinite sentence with a tariff of 10 years after being convicted of causing or allowing Peter’s death.

Owen was convicted of the same offence and, after challenging his initial sentence, he was jailed for six years.
