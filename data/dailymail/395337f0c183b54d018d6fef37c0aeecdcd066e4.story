Snow over the weekend shattered records to make this winter Boston's snowiest ever - but Mother Nature might not be done yet.

The city awoke Monday yet again to its accustomed blanket of white - but this time it had a special significance, as the latest 2.9 inches pushed the city into unprecedented territory of 108.6 inches in one season.

But, though temperatures in Massachusetts are regularly above freezing now, there could still be new flurries to take the record even higher before spring sets in.

According to the Weather Channel, Friday night could bring an extra fraction of an inch.

Meanwhile predictions from AccuWeather note the chance of snow around 7am Wednesday, and a vaguer prediction of a snow/slush downfall on Saturday night.

The previous record was 107.9 inches, which was set in the winter of 1995-96. The records cover more than a century, going back to 1872.

Boston's official total is measured at Logan airport, by an anonymous figure who heads outside with a ruler, takes an average of four measurements and submits his totals to the National Weather Service.

The final 2.9 inches came in a snowstorm that was relatively tame after a record-setting monthly snowfall of 64.9 inches in February.

The worst previous single month was January 2005 when 43.3 inches fell.

This official winter snowfall, measured from December through February this year, was 99.4 inches. That was the snowiest for the winter period, beating 91.5 inches in 1993-94.

The season snowfall record is measured from July 1 through June 30, and takes in autumn and spring.

Forecasters note snow can still mount up this year. March 1993 had 38.9 inches, and March 1916 had 33.

At the height of the relentless snow storms, residents of Boston were left wondering when the weather would calm down. 

Last month,  Boston's transport system ground to a halt as authorities struggled to cope with the bad weather.

At one point, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) public transport was not running at all and had no subways or buses. Meanwhile, flights to and from Boston's Logan Airport were canceled.

It's been a brutal winter for many people across the East Coast of the United States with non-stop snow storms.

However, Boston's residents have begun to recover from the plummeting temperatures which fell to around zero.

Matt Doody, a meteorologist at the weather service told The Boston Globe the record-breaking figures were 'pretty impressive.'

Foot upon foot of unrelenting snow did little to brighten the spirits of Boston's residents - but it did have one silver lining.

In the wake of blizzard season, a costumed joker who dubbed himself the Boston Yeti started cropping up around the blanketed city.

And now the figure, whose @BostonYeti2015 Twitter account has amassed 8,500 followers, has received his just reward.

In the midst of the city's St Patrick's day parade on Sunday, mayor Marty Walsh invited the masked figure to pose in front of a City of Boston backdrop and declared him 'interim mayor'.

However, Walsh did feel compelled to step in moments after the prank and clarify 'I love Boston and am here to stay'. 

Only kidding: Boston's actual mayor Marty Walsh, left, soon stepped in to clarify that he wasn't being replaced by a mythical figure
