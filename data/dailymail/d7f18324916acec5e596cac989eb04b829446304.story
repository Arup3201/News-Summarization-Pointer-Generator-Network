British tennis star Andy Murray comfortably won his first round match on day one of the Australian Open tennis tournament.

The sixth seed stayed well on top of his opponent - India's Yuki Bhambri - and will now play Australian Marinko Matosevic in the second round.

Murray's fiancee Kim Sears was seen smiling court-side as she watched her husband-to-be put the pressure on the 22-year-old.

This comes as local favourite Ana Ivanovic, who once dated Australian golfer Adam Scott, was knocked out of the Open by Czech player Lucie Hradecka.

Ivanovic, from Serbia, is fifth seed making her the highest seed to exit the tournament so far.

Murray, 27, had a fine end to 2014 after arriving in Melbourne last year uncertain after back surgery.

But the three-time runner-up could potentially have to conquer world No.10 Grigor Dimitrov, who leads the band of hungry young guns with eighth seed Milos Raonic, then Federer, Nadal and Djokovic in successive matches to win this year's Open.

'Obviously a very tough draw. Very difficult draw,' Murray said. 

'If you have to play all of those players, obviously it's going to be extremely difficult to come through that. I'm aware of that.' 

Tennis fans have arriving early at Melbourne Park for day one of the Australian Openon Monday.

Some big names take to the court today including Nick Kyrgios, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Maria Sharapova and Ana Ivanovic.

Conditions in Melbourne are much cooler than they were during last year's Open, when temperatures reached over 40 degrees on multiple days and play was put on hold numerous times.

World No.1 Novak Djokovic may be the favourite to win the Open as he and Federer each bid for an open-era record fifth title, but the Swiss master talked himself up ahead of his first-round clash with Taiwan's Yen-Hsun Lu on Monday.

Despite being 33 and a father of four, the ageless champion claimed he was a more complete player now than when he dominated the sport like no other before almost a decade ago.

'I would hope that over the years I've always improved,' said the world No.2.

'I think I'm serving more consistent and stronger than I ever have. That's my opinion.'

Third seed Nadal will play Russia's Mikhail Youzhny at Rod Laver Arena on Monday.

The Spaniard has won just four matches - and none against a top-20 rival - since Wimbledon and suspects it's too soon to contend after battling an ongoing back issue and withdrawing from the ATP tour finals following surgery for appendicitis. 

'I don't feel myself ready to win,' Nadal said.

'I don't consider myself one of the favourites here.'
