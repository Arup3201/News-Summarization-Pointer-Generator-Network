The Los Angeles police officer who detained Django Unchained actress Daniele Watts has spoken out to defend his actions and said he never suspected her of being a prostitute - despite her claims otherwise.

Sergeant Jim Parker told the Los Angeles Times that he never intended to arrest Watts or her boyfriend Brian James Lucas when he was called to an LA studio parking lot for a report of two people have sex in a car. 

'I figured I could take care of this call and go get coffee and that was it,' Sgt Parker told the newspaper.

Watts has defended her decision not to hand over her identification and says she was harassed by the LAPD and that she had done nothing wrong

Instead, he says, Watts turned it into a 'long, drawn-out drama.'

Watts says she was accused of being a prostitute and targeted because she is black and her boyfriend is white.

 Witnesses told TMZ that they watched Watts and her boyfriend having sex in their car with the door open. They watched her get out and wipe herself with a tissue then throw it on the ground, according to the gossip site. 

 Watts maintains she was merely making out with him.

She was handcuffed and detained after she refused to show the officer her identification and tried to walk away.

'I was trying to ID them and leave. Nobody wanted them arrested for having sex in public,' Sgt Parker told the Times. 

'But then she went into her tirade.'

 Miss Watts told CNN that she stands by her decision not handing over her ID. 

'I believe what this country stands for and I believe in freedom and I believe in a country that calls itself the land of the free and the home of the brave,' she said on Monday. 

'If I am within my amendment rights, my constitutional rights to say no, unless you're charging me with a crime, I will not be giving you my ID, that is a right that I stand up for.' 

California law allows police to handcuff and detain people in order to identify them.

The LAPD says it is conducting a review of the incident. The department is also investigating a complain Miss Watts file against Sgt Parker. 

A recording of the encounter, obtained by the TMZ and the Times, shows Parker explaining: 'Somebody called, which gives me the right to be here, so it gives me the right to identify you by law.'

Watts responds: 'Do you know how many times I’ve been called, the cops have been called just for being black? Just because we’re black and he’s white? I’m just being really honest, sir.'

Sgt Parker replies: 'Who brought up the race card?'
