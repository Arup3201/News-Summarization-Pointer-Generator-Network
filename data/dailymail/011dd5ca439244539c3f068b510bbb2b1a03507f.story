Jodhi Meares' fiance Jon Stevens had a police enforced Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) placed against him in court on Thursday, after he was arrested in the early hours of Monday, charged with one count of common assault after alleged confrontation between the pair.

Neither Stevens nor Meares were present at Waverley Local Court, where the singer was represented by lawyer Greg Goold.

Stevens, 53, remains on police bail and with the interim AVO in place until the matter is heard again on May 18.

There are no restrictions in place preventing Stevens from living with his partner at their Point Piper home, as Jodhi Meares, listed as the victim in the matter 'declined to make a statement'. However, he lawyer, Chris Murphy, did issue a statement in which she claimed to hold no fear.

'I am emphatically instructed by Jodhi Meares that she is totally without fear or concerns in relation to any future conduct by the subject of the application Jon Stevens,' he stated.

'I am also instructed by my client that there is absolutely no history of violence in the relationship between them.'

However, the court documents state the conditions of bail include that: 'The accused is not to assault, molest, harass, threaten or interfere (with the victim) and not to stalk or intimidate.'

Calm before the storm: Jodhi Meares and rocker fiance Jon Stevens put up a united front at the David Jones Autumn/Winter launch in Sydney last week. He has been granted police bail and has an interim AVO against him after the common assault case went before court on Thursday

Jodhi Meares' lawyer Chris Murphy posted this statement on her behalf as Jon Stevens' court appearance drew near on Thursday morning

Police granted conditional bail on the basis that Stevens (listed as John Stevenson in the court) has no criminal history and no history of violence.

The New Zealand-born Noiseworks rocker was arrested at 4.45am on Monday with the charge sheet reading that between 2.00 and 5.15 he (Stevens) did assault Jodhi Meares.

Meantime, Meares' company The Upside has posted an apparent message of support for the designer, following the reports she was assaulted.

Following the news, the Instagram account for Jodhi's leisurewear brand The Upside on Thursday morning posted a quote attributed to Kurt Cobain, reading, 'I'd rather be hated for who I am than loved for who I am not.'

The second dramatic incident for Jodhi in just eight months (she rolled her Range Rover in Bondi in June and recorded a blood alcohol level of 0.181) will no doubt come as a blow to the socialite and businesswoman, who has been working hard building her active wear label The Upside over the past few years.

It seemed like she could finally put the incident behind her last week when she glowed with pride as model Jessica Gomes paraded pieces from The Upside down the runway at the David Jones Autumn/Winter collection launch, Jodhi sipping water and staying close to the side of her fiance throughout the night.

Day in court: The Sydney socialite and fashion designer faced court in August over drinking driving charges, after she rolled her Range Rover in Bondi in June and recorded a blood alcohol level 0.181. She was banned from driving for 12 months and received a $1,100 fine. No conviction was recorded

Crash: Jodhi collided with three parked cars when she rolled her Range Rover in Bondi on June 21 last year

Choosing to stick to water was surely no coincidence at the 43-year-old's first public appearance since she faced court in August, the former wife of billionaire James Packer no doubt hoping to repair her image as a clean-living fashionista. 

In court over the drink driving case, which resulted in Jodhi not having a conviction recorded and receiving a 12-month driving ban and a fine for $1,100, her solicitor Chris Murphy said Meares had been 'haunted' by her marriage to Packer, which lasted from 1999 until they separated in 2002. 

Incident: In court at the time of the hearing to make a decision on Meares' sentence, her lawyer said the former model weighed about 48.5 kilograms and had drunk 'about four and three-quarter' glasses of red wine over four and a half hours and eaten just a small piece of lamb when she got behind the wheel

'She was married for just over two years [to James Packer] and that haunts everything that's said about it [the marriage],' he said.

'She's not a celebrity, she's not a movie star. She was raised by a single mother. They moved apartments every four months. There were four children, she went to three different high schools.

'She had the good fortune to make money in modelling, and in the late 90s, she created the label Tiger Lily, and married Jamie Packer.'  

'Haunted' by marriage: Also heard in court was how the 43-year-old is 'haunted' by her marriage and subsequent divorce to billionaire James Packer, who she married in 1999 and split from in 2002

Bikini babe: Jodhi rose to fame as a swimsuit model, and eventually went on to design them with her label Tigerlily, which she founded in 2000 and eventually sold to Billabong in 2007 for an amount estimated by some to be as much as $5 million

And while Jodhi has worked to create a life for herself out of her ex-husband's shadow, the court case also shone a light on how her fashion label is struggling to make money, despite its popularity among style-loving Sydney-siders.

Mr Murphy said Ms Meares had not made any money from The Upside, had to pay staff for taking maternity leave and had given any profits to a Cambodian orphans charity, the Cambodian Children's Trust.

'Every garment that is sold by that business, a payment is made to the Cambodian trust,' he said.

'In this particular situation she has a business which is in its early stages, but it doesn't make money - but the cheque goes to the Cambodian orphanage ... with the slum children.'

Short lived: Sadly the pair were not able to survive the tumultuous time of James' failing One-Tel business, and the pair announced their separation on 2002

She sold Tigerlily, the swimwear label she founded in 2000 during her marriage to Packer, to surfwear giant Billabong in 2007 for an amount reported to be between $3 and $5 million, staying on as a consultant before eventually cutting ties. 

Jodhi married James in a lavish ceremony said to have cost $10 million, but memories of the reported 750 guests and private two-hour show by Elton John  couldn't sustain their feelings through three tumultuous years, and the couple split in a blaze of publicity in 2002.

The year before, James suffered through the collapse of the communications business One-Tel.

Once the fourth-largest telecommunications company in Australia, it collapsed dramatically and ended owing up to $350 million.

While the details of her divorce settlement have never been disclosed - and Jodhi has rarely talked about her marriage- the package she walked away with was said to have included a multi-million dollar property portfolio for Jodhi, including a Bronte home she sold for $3.41 million.

But life in the spotlight didn't suit Jodhi, who famously failed to show up for the series live finale of Australia's Next Top Model of which she was the host in 2008 because of paralysing stage fright, leaving the late Charlotte Dawson to step in at the eleventh hour and save the day, crowning that year's winner, Demelza Reveley.

Much was made of the incident, but later that year the star was to suffer a devastating loss which would affect her deeply.

As the year went on, Jodhi began missing social events and eventually revealed she had been nursing her beloved dog Tenzin, who was suffering from bone cancer.

The pup was rumoured to have come from a litter from media mogul and then father-in-law Kerry Packer's rottweiler pet.

Tied the knot? Jodhi was happy to wear what appears to be a wedding band next to her engagement ring as she stepped out in Sydney’s Rose Bay on Saturday, two days before the domestic incident with Jon. The couple confirmed their engagement in 2013 but have never confirmed a wedding ceremony

But when adored pup Tenzin, who'd been her constant companion throughout the ups and downs of her very public life since they became pet-and-owner eight years before, succumbed to bone cancer in December, leaving the star distraught.

Another turning point came when Jodhi lost her father in 2012, prompting her to make a fresh start in Hawaii.

She keeps a home and spends plenty of time there, where Jon proposed in 2013. 

But what will become of the status of the couple's relationship remains to be seen after Sunday night's incident in which Stevens is accused of assaulting his fiancee.

According to reports from Channel Nine, the incident allegedly occurred after the former wife of James Packer discovered text messages on Jon's phone. Jodhi is believed to have sustained minor injuries on her wrist.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported the police were called to the couples' home after the fight and immediately issued an interim AVO, forbidding the Jezebal hitmaker from going near Jodhi for 28 days. The former INXS rocker was arrested and charged with assault.

The rocker had been due to play several gigs this week, including Rooty Hill RSL on Friday night and Revesby Workers Club on Saturday night, but the shows have now been cancelled, with concert-goers offered refunds.
