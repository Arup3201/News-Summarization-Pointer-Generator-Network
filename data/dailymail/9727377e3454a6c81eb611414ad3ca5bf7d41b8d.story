Hands on the trophy: The Germans lift the World Cup after beating Argentina 1-0 in extra-time

German daily newspaper Der Tagesspiegel have the iconic pose of one of their players lifting the World Cup with the image zoomed into the prestigious trophy.

Munich's tabloid newspaper TZ have the words 'at last' splashed over their newspaper as Germany ended their 14-year wait for the World Cup - while Morgenpost fail to hide their delight at their national side adding a fourth star to their football strip.

Catalan-based newspaper Mundo Deportivo simply lead with the headline 'Alem4nia' which translates to 'Germany'. They have used four in their headline to reference the amount of times fellow Europeans Germany have now won the World Cup.

Marca have also dedicated much of their front page to Germany's victory but they have decided to take a swipe at Argentina's Lionel Messi.

The Barcelona star failed to make any real impact on Sunday night to the delight of Madrid newspaper Marca.

They say that Argentina's captain 'disappeared' in his country's quest to win their first World up since 1986.

Sport also choose to focus on Messi's disappointing World Cup final and include a small line on FIFA's decision to refuse Barcelona permission to present new signing Luis Suarez at the Camp Nou due to the striker's lengthy ban.

Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport congratulate Germany on their triumph and also find room to include Arturo Vidal's quotes on his proposed move to Manchester United.
