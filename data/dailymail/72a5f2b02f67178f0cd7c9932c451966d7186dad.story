Syrian government forces launched a series of blistering attacks in the major cities of Deera, Hama and Homs, a day after President Bashar Assad's offer of a referendum was rejected by both rebel forces and the entire western world.

Tanks and armoured personnel carriers rumbled through residential streets while terrified citizens took shelter in their homes as heavy artillery rained down reducing many buildings to rubble.

In Deera, the border city where the uprising began last March, locals reported large explosions and machinegun fire echoing through 
districts under constant attack by government troops.

Blast: A home is reduced to rubble in the Baba Amro neighbourhood in the rebel-held city of Homs. The government unleashed a fresh wave of attacks less than a day after President Assad's offer of a referendum was rejected

In Hama, a city with a bloody 
history of resistance to Assad's late father Hafez al-Assad, opposition 
activists said shelling and sniper fire had killed at least five people 
and wounded 50 in 36 hours. 

And in the rebel-held city of Homs artillery
 shells rained down for the 13th day in a succession as fires started when a 
oil pipeline was hit continued to belch clouds of black smoke into the air.

The city of Deera, close to the border with Jordan, was the scene of the first 
demonstrations against Assad's rule, provoked by the arrest of several 
women activists and the detention of schoolboys who had written freedom 
slogans on walls, inspired by other Arab Spring revolts. 

Hussam Izzedine, a member of the Syrian human rights 
organisation Sawasiah said: 'The
 army bombardment started around dawn and after that exchanges of fire 
occurred.

'Demonstrations
 have resumed and the Free Syrian Army has been providing security for 
protests in some parts of the city,' he added.

The
 state news agency said security forces 'chased and fought with an armed
 terrorist group in the Hamidiya neighbourhood of Hama that has been 
terrifying citizens' and arrested some of its members, who had automatic
 rifles and rocket propelled grenades.       

The Local Coordination Committees, an activist group, said at least four people were killed by army fire concentrated on Baba Amro district, a Sunni neighbourhood.     

There was no comment from Syrian authorities, who tightly restrict media access to the country.  

And in the capital Damascus, troops killed at least two youths when they swept into the Barzeh district, searching houses and making arrests, residents said.

Assad's offer of a referendum on a new constitution in two weeks' time, leading to multi-party elections within 90 days, drew scornful rejections from both the opposition and the West.

The White House described the offer as 'quite laughable'.

Speaking from Air Force One Carney as President Obama travelled to Milwaukee, press secretary Jay Carney said Assad's announcement 'made a mockery' of the Syrian uprising.

Mr Carney claimed Assad has reneged on every promise of reform since the start of demonstrations against his regime and said his promises have usually been followed by increased brutality.

France said it was negotiating a new U.N. Security Council resolution on Syria with Russia, Assad's ally and main arms supplier, and wanted to create humanitarian corridors to ease the plight of civilians caught up in the violence.

An authoritative Chinese newspaper, apparently responding to criticism of China and Russia for vetoing a U.N. Security Council resolution urging Assad to step down, said on Thursday that meddling in Syria by foreign powers risked stirring up a hornets' nest of bloodshed and instability in the region.   

The commentary in the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, carried an author's pen name that is often used to state Beijing's foreign policy stance.

'The political ecology in the Middle 
East is extremely frail, a tangled mess of thousands of years of ethnic 
and religious conflict,' the commentary said.

World
 powers must realise this and handle bloodshed in Syria and Middle East 
tensions with a sense of realism, the paper said, adding that the spread
 of conflict would be a 'catastrophe' in a crucial phase of global 
economic recovery. 

'The Middle East is the world's most important fuel depot. If gripped by chaos, oil prices would skyrocket, shocking the stock market, financial systems and economies,' the paper said.        

Washington's aim was to install a friendly government in Syria to counter the influence in the region of Iran, it said.     

The Chinese foreign ministry said later that Vice Foreign Minister Zhai Jun would visit Syria on Friday and Saturday.

The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told French radio: 'The idea of humanitarian corridors that I previously proposed to allow NGOs to reach the zones where there are scandalous massacres should be discussed at the Security Council.'

He said a U.N. General Assembly vote on Thursday on a non-binding resolution on Syria would be 'symbolic'. It follows a Feb. 4 veto by Russia and China of a draft Security Council resolution that backed an Arab League call for Assad to quit.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: 'If the plan is to use the Security Council and United Nations to adopt some language to help legitimise regime change, then I'm afraid international law does not allow this and we cannot support such an approach.'

Diplomats said Arab delegations had rejected proposed Russian amendments which would weaken the Assembly resolution.

The Arab League wants a joint U.N. Arab peacekeeping force to be deployed in Syria and has adopted a resolution that would allow its members to arm Syrian rebels.

Libya's interim leader, Mustafa Abdel Jalil, said the exiled opposition Syrian National Council (SNC) would be allowed to open an office in Tripoli.

'We support the Syrian people and their aspirations,' he said. 

Syrian state media said on Wednesday a draft constitution to be put to a vote on Feb. 26 would establish a multi-party system in Syria, under Baath Party rule since 1963. Parliamentary elections would follow within 90 days of its approval.  

The constitution would allow the president to be elected for two seven-year terms. Assad's late father Hafez was president for 29 years and was succeeded by his son when he died in 2000.    

Melhem al-Droubi, a member of the SNC and the Muslim Brotherhood, told Reuters Assad must resign now.

'Bashar al-Assad has increased the killing and slaughter in Syria. He has lost his legitimacy and we aren't interested in his rotten constitutions, old or new,' he said.

The United States also dismissed the referendum plan.

The Syrian leader dismisses the revolt as the work of terrorists backed by a conspiracy of enemy nations.   

Thousands of civilians have been killed since the uprising began in March, inspired by other Arab revolts. The government says more than 2,000 soldiers and police have been killed.
