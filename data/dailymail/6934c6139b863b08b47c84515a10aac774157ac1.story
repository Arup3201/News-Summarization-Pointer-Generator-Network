A teenager who caught meningitis at a California university last month has had both his legs amputated as school officials confirm a fourth person has been diagnosed.

Lacrosse player Aaron Loy, 18, from Carlsbad, had the lower part of both legs amputated after a blood infection caused severe complications from the bacterial disease.

He picked up the disease at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) in November along with three others, who have not been named.

Outbreak: Loy and three other undergraduates became ill within a three-week time period in November. Loy, pictured here carrying his father, Ken Loy, on his shoulders, was the only one who had his legs amputated

The Santa Barbara County Public Health Department and UCSB said the four undergraduates became ill of the Meningococcal disease - infection caused by the bacteria known as Neisseria meningitidis - within a three-week time period.

This comes just weeks after seven cases of meningitis occurred on Princeton University's college campus in New Jersey.

UCSB released a statement saying it has provided preventive antibiotics to more than 500 students who were identified as close contacts of the initial three ill students, according to CBS8.

Close contacts of the fourth case have also been identified and have received antibiotics.

The students will be directed to get the antibiotics at UCSB no later than Tuesday and will be directed to take the medication onsite.

Meningitis is the inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord and may be caused by infection with viruses, bacteria, or other microorganisms, and less commonly by certain drugs.

The most common symptoms of meningitis are fever, severe headaches and neck stiffness.

Bacterial and viral meningitis are contagious; however, neither is as contagious as the common cold or flu.

Even students who have been given preventive antibiotics can become ill depending on the timing of exposure; preventive antibiotics only offer protection for about one day, so students can become ill if exposed to the bacteria again in the future.

Supportive: Loy's parents, pictured, are documenting their son's progress on a website, Caring Bridge. They say his 'competitive spirit will help him recover'

The university has suspended some of their social events on campus, including parties sponsored by fraternities and sororities, in ‘an effort to interrupt transmission of the outbreak strain in social networks’.

‘These actions are initiated with the goal of protecting health and preventing additional cases of meningococcal disease. They are important and compliance is greatly appreciated,’ said the university and the health department in a joint statement.

In the meantime, Loy is still recovering at UCSD Medical Center and having to get used to the fact that his legs are gone.

His parents are documenting their son's progress on a website, Caring Bridge.

They say their son’s ‘competitive spirit will help him recover’ but said ‘his journey ahead is lengthy’.

Two funds have been set up for Aaron and his family to help with mounting medical bills.

There are approximately 2,600 cases of bacterial meningitis per year in the United States, and on average 333,000 cases in developing countries. The case fatality rate ranges between 10 and 20 per cent.

Meningitis is the inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord and may be caused by infection with viruses, bacteria, or other microorganisms, and less commonly by certain drugs.

It can be life-threatening because of the inflammation's proximity to the brain and spinal cord.

The most common symptoms of meningitis are fever, severe headaches and neck stiffness.

People will also experience confusion or altered consciousness, vomiting and an inability to tolerate light or loud noises.

Bacterial and viral meningitis are contagious; however, neither is as contagious as the common cold or flu.

Both
can be transmitted through droplets of respiratory secretions during 
close contact such as kissing, sneezing or coughing on someone, but 
cannot be spread by only breathing the air where a person with 
meningitis has been.

Viral meningitis is typically caused by enteroviruses, and is most commonly spread through fecal contamination.

Meningococcal
disease describes infections caused by the bacterium Neisseria 
meningitidis. It carries a high mortality 
rate if untreated.
