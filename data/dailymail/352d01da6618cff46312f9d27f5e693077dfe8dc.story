Bendtner has hit a rich vein of form for Wolfsburg and he recently scored a double against FK Krasnodar

The 26-year-old had numerous injury problems during his time at Arsenal which kept him out of the team

“It was a terrible situation. My last year at Arsenal was a waste of time," Bendtner told Tipsbladet.

"It was worthless that Arsenal did not allow me to leave.

"A club like Arsenal could easily have found someone else to play my role. They would have had no trouble finding a player who could do what they wanted me to do."
