A teenage girl compelled to testify in the statutory rape trial of an ex-high school sports coach known as 'Wild Man' has claimed it was she who pursued the relationship not him.

Speaking at the trial of former Alameda High School girls basketball coach Wesley Specht, 27, the unnamed girl gave intimate details of how the pair had sex on at least nine occasions, one of them being at his home.

Defending the one-time professional basketball player, the girl recalled how she affectionately called him 'Punk', brought him a bottle of rum and enjoyed a date in a hot-tub at Specht's parent's house in Lakewood, Colorado.

High School basketball coach Wesley Specht is accused of having sex with three underage girls of which the youngest was 15 between November 2010 and April 2011

Appearing at Jefferson County District Court, the girl, who was 17 at the time the pair allegedly began their relationship, hid her face as she testified and sighed out loud as she defended the disgraced former coach.

'I cared for Wes, and they (prosecutors) knew I didn't want him to get into trouble for something we both wanted,' said the girl who is now 18 according to the Denver Post.

'The attention he gave me was really nice. He would listen to me. He would understand me.'

Consent in any case of underage sex is not a defence for statutory rape in Colorado and the girl is not being identified because she was underage at the time of the alleged crime.

A player with the Colorado Kings basketball team, Specht is charged with seven sexually motivated felonies relating to underage relationships with three girls from November 2010 to April 2011 at Alameda High School.

One of the girls was 15 when Specht allegedly began his pursuit of her and according to a police affidavit the girl said they had sex on his desk before practice and in his car, again before practice.

The girl also informed police at the time that she and Specht had exchanged 7,000 text messages and in those messages were some semi nude images and one fully nude picture of her.

Hired by the high school in 2009, Specht was ironically promoted to become head coach after the previous incumbent was fired for inappropriately texting girls on the team.

The underage sex scandal involving Specht came to the attention of police after the athletic director's administrative assistant became privy to gossip they overheard during a conversation between the boys basketball coach and the principals secretary.

'It was a faculty member that finally decided what they were hearing was probably some type of an inappropriate relationship going on and came forward,' said Lakewood police spokesman Steve Davis.

Upon being interviewed by police, the student claimed that the sex was what she wanted and refuted claims that Specht has in any way abused his position.

Admitting to nine sexual incidents to police, she stated they had sex at his Arvada, Colorado home, once in his car in a Belmar Park parking lot and once at his parent's Highland Ranch home.

However, 'It makes no difference if it's consensual, it's strictly illegal,' said Davis.

Facing seven felony counts, including a pattern of sexual assault on a child by someone in a position of trust, enticement of a child and possession of graphic images depicting underage subjects, Specht has been on a $10,000 bond since his April 2011 arrest.

The court heard about a secretly recorded phone call that the 18-year old alleged victim made at the request of Lakewood Police after they had become aware of Specht's activities.

Panicked over the escalating rumours about his sexual activities, Specht tried to cool his relationship with the girl.

'Those are serious rumours. That's what you don't understand,' said Specht to the teenager during the call.

In addition to Specht two other staff members at Alameda High School were removed from their posts after they willingly withheld information about the coach's alleged underage affairs

However, contrary to the claims of the girl in court, the prosecution produced a chain of texts sent by Specht to the girl which indicates that he was the main driving force behind the relationship.

'Still got that bottle of Bacardi,' said Specht in a text from April 2011.

'I'm up for it if you are,' replied the teenager.

Upon the former coach being arrested in April 2011, students who had been aware of the gossip surrounding Specht spoke about the atmosphere during training.

'All the basketball girls started going, 'Oh my gosh. Did you hear about Coach Wes?' said team member Savannah Duran.

'You could tell by the way he talked to some girls, it was weird for an older man.'

Other girls were completely in the dark.

'No one really knew and the people who did know kind of just kept to themselves about it because it's not our business,' said Tiffany Williams.

'A lot of girls said that he was flirty with everyone. I think he was just a really friendly guy.'

In addition to Specht, two other employees were fired for what they knew and how they handled the information.

The trial is continuing.
