Turkish Airline, which recently came under fire for banning lipstick, fired a stewardess after bosses found racy pictures she did for an Italian magazine.

Zuhal Sengal, 31, from Istanbul, was sacked after airline chiefs found pictures from her work as a model.

The airline said modelling was not one of 'certain standards and qualities' expected from staff - but the move is seen as a sign the country is becoming more religious.

She was fired as modelling is not one of the 'certain standards and qualities' expected from employees

In the pictures, Ms Sengal poses provocatively dressed in a corset and bustier. 

And a video of the shoot shows her walking around a swimming pool in a skimpy bikini revealing tattoos on her body. 

A spokesman for the company said: 'There are certain standards and qualities we expect from our staff and modelling is not one of them.' 

The airline has previously told employees investigations will be conducted into those who post inappropriate material on social media.

And last year, it was criticised after trying to prevent female crew members for wearing certain colours of lipstick.  

Staff were told pink, red or claret lipstick as well as tattoos, high buns and wigs were forbidden.

A statement from the airline said: 'Simple make-up, immaculate and in pastel colours, is preferred for staff working in the service sector.'

But the move by Turkish Airlines is seen as a sign the country is becoming more conservative and religious

But bosses were forced to withdraw the ban after staff guidelines were leaked to the media causing a storm of protest with the airline being accused of becoming 'too Islamic.'

Airline bosses have admitted Turkey is becoming more Islamic as the airline is attempting to shape the company to fit its ideology. 

President of the airline's Hava-Is labour union, Atilay Aycin, said: 'This new guideline is totally down to Turkish Airlines management's desire to shape the company to fit its own political and ideological stance.

'No one can deny that Turkey has become a more conservative, religious country.'

Temel Kotil, the airline's chief executive said: 'As to the lipstick, we had no problems but somehow low-level managers put together a paper without asking us and that paper was leaked to the media and became a big issue.'

Last year, the airline was criticised after issuing guidelines banning female employees from wearing red, pink and claret lipstick
