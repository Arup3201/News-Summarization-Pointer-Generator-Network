Barcelona are unlikely to allow Cristian Tello to move on loan to Arsenal for the rest of the season - meaning Arsene Wenger will have to look elsewhere to supplement his squad in the next 24 hours.

Arsenal are still negotiating with Schalke over a Â£37million move for Julian Draxler and are expected to complete the deal on Friday.

But with injuries to Theo Walcott, who is out for the rest of the season, Aaron Ramsey, out for another month and Jack Wilshere, who is doubtful for Sunday's game against Crystal Palace with an ankle injury, Wenger is keen to make further additions to his squad to shore up a title challenge.

Wanted man: Wenger sees Juventus striker Mirko Vucinic as competition for Frenchman Olivier Giroud

He is now expected to return to earlier loan targets, Real Madrid's Alvaro Morata and Juventus' Mirko Vucinic.

Tello is an attacking wide player while Morata and Vucinic are centre forwards to provide cover for Olivier Giroud - but there is a desire at Arsenal to deepen the squad to ensure they can negotiate a difficult February fixture list, which sees them play Liverpool twice, Manchester United and Bayern Munich.

Draxler, who is currently sidelined, would provide cover on the left and behind the strikers when he recovered from an ankle injury next month - though Wenger sees him as a centre forward in the long term.
