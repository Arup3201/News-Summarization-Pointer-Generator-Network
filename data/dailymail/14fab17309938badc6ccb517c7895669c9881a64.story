A notorious benefits cheat who lied about rents collected from tenants at her seven-bedroom home saw her son’s promising rugby career derailed after his club discovered the fraud, a court has heard.

Lynne Hampson, 52, of Worcester Park, south-west London - whose winger son Sam, 24, has played for London Wasps and London Irish - has finally been sentenced four years after pleading guilty.

She admitted failing to notify a change in her personal circumstances between 2002 and 2007 in relation to an income support claim, which saw the Department for Work and Pensions lose £15,843.

Hampson also admitted failing to notify a change in her circumstances between May and June 2006 in relation to a council tax benefit claim, resulting in a loss of £48 to the London Borough of Sutton.

She told the DWP that she only charged tenants £20 per week - but was renting out rooms at the property, which has a swimming pool in its 120ft back garden, for £480 to £540 per month.

During the five-year scam she converted her loft with the illicit profits, adding three bedrooms to the house - on a road with an average property value of £369,000 - almost doubling her rental capacity.

There has been a four-year sentencing delay due to Hampson twice unsuccessfully applying to withdraw her guilty pleas and petitioning the Social Security Tribunal to reduce her unlawful claim from an initial figure of over £45,000.

She achieved local notoriety after the council published her conviction. Her lawyer David Burgess said: ‘It was picked-up by local newspapers and she has been subjected to a four-year campaign of harassment and criminal damage.

‘For her the criminal record is a very, very serious thing and her son, a professional rugby player’s signing with Bath was declined because a Google search revealed this woman’s prosecution for fraud on the London Borough of Sutton’s website.’

Following a tip-off from a disgruntled ex-tenant in 2007 Sutton Council’s fraud investigation team worked with the DWP to gather evidence and prosecute Hampson.

She initially denied the fraud, but on the first day of her trial in December, 2009 she eventually admitted the two charges.

Hampson did not surrender to the glass-panelled secure dock due to agoraphobia, which can instigate panic attacks. Mr Burgess added: ‘This lady has had a number of problems throughout her life, not just her physical and mental well-being, but generally surviving.’

A doctor described her as someone ‘trapped in the hopelessness of her situation, which is taking a toll on her health’.

The court heard she has depression, 
anxiety, arthritis, early dementia and Mr Burgess said: ‘Her condition 
has been aggravated by these proceedings, which has not improved her 
mental state.’

'When probation officers spoke to you, you did not do yourself any favours'

Judge Daniel Flahive

Another report described her as ‘paranoid and vulnerable’, concluding: ‘People take advantage of her with her willing participation.’

Judge Daniel Flahive sentenced Hampson to 28 days' imprisonment last Friday, suspended for 12 months, telling her: ‘The sums involved came about because you did not declare properly rental income you received from lodgers.

‘When probation officers spoke to you, you did not do yourself any favours. Yesterday [Thursday] was the first time documentation was produced to the court confirming that you do have these medical conditions.’
