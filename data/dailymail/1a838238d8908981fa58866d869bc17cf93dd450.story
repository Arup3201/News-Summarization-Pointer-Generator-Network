France's new socialist government is to pass a law making it illegal to arrest Britain-bound migrants flooding into Calais.

The proposed legislation comes after the country's highest court ruled illegal immigrants cannot be held in custody for having no identity papers.

It is feared the new rules - due to become law in the autumn - will unleash a fresh tide of migrants on the northern French coast hoping to sneak on lorries and ferries to Britain.

'Mini-Sangatte': The wooden prefabricated huts currently have around 50 asylum seekers living in them

President Francois Hollande's ruling 
left-wing party has also allowed the construction of 'refugee chalets' 
close to Calais which have been dubbed a new 'mini-Sangatte' - the 
notorious Channel migrant camp closed down ten years ago.

The
cluster of pre-fabricated buildings already have 50 migrants living in 
them, and sources in the Pas de Calais department have said more migrant
chalets are set to be built.

The
latest ruling by the Court of Cassation earlier this month means their 
inhabitants are now free to make repeated attempts to sneak across the 
Channel without fear of arrest.

Originally a hangar for storing drilling equipment when the Channel Tunnel was under construction, the Sangatte camp began sheltering refugees in 1999 and was open for three years.

The centre was initially handed over to the Red Cross to offer shelter to people, mainly families, fleeing the Balkans.

That population was supplanted by people fleeing Afghanistan and subsequently Iraqi Kurds.

Eurotunnel claimed it stopped 18,500 refugees trying to smuggle themselves into Britain in the first half of 2002 alone, the vast majority of whom were from the camp.

In 2002 then home secretary David Blunkett and France interior minister Nicolas Sarkozy reached an agreement to shut it down.

Despite the closure of the centre at the end of 2002, the problem remains, with refugees arriving in Sangatte every day.

France's new interior minister Manuel Valls is keen to provide accommodation for the migrants in the area.

After the election of the socialist government this spring work began on the new camp at Norrent-Fontes.

Migrants can only be detained for up to six hours while police attempt to establish their identity.

Even
if they are found to be in France illegally, the new law will state 
they cannot held in secure detention centres but must be allowed to walk
free.

The law will affect 
around 1,000 illegal immigrants massed on the northern French coast, and
up to 60,000 across the whole of France.

French
interior minister Manuel Valls said: 'The decision handed down by the 
Court of Cassation forbids from now on placing people in custody on the 
sole motive that they are here illegally.

'The prime minister has asked me to draw up a legal text as soon as possible to give this ruling a legal foundation.'

The law would come before parliament in the autumn, a spokesman for Mr Valls added.

The announcement has been hailed as a 'victory for human rights' by refugee groups in France.

Agathe
Marin, spokeswoman for the Cimade refugees' association, said: 'Until 
now, the police have been arresting and detaining immigrants on a 
massive scale.

'After they 
are detained, most of these people are released anyway. We hope that 
this ruling will ensure that the police are respectful of immigrants' 
basic rights and stop treating them like criminals.'

Since
the bulldozing of the Sangatte camp in 2002 - which acted as a stepping
stone for an estimated 50,000 migrants to reach Britain - numbers of 
illegal immigrants in Calais have been gradually falling.

The Red Cross-run centre which housed refugees at Sangatte, near the French terminal of the Channel tunnel was closed by Nicolas Sarkozy in 2002

Former
president Nicolas Sarkozy ordered the destruction of a squalid woodland
camp known as the Jungle in 2009 and bussed almost 300 refugees out of 
the area.

A year later, another 100 migrants were removed from a woodland encampment in the Channel coast town of Teteghem.

But
it is now feared the socialist's 'gentler' approach to illegal 
immigration could see thousands more migrants flooding back to Calais.

A
right-wing town councillor who asked not to be named said today: 'We 
spent a decade trying to clear up this problem that has blighted our 
town.

'Now with several strokes of the pen, the left-wingers in Paris and making it much more attractive for them all to return.'
