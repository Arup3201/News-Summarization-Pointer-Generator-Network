Jose Mourinho believes Fernando Torres needed a 'change of scenery' from Chelsea, but the Portuguese would have preferred if the Spain striker had moved to Inter Milan rather than AC Milan.

Torres agreed a two-year loan move to Milan - and not Mourinho's former team Inter - after a challenging three-and-a-half-years at Stamford Bridge following his £50million arrival from Liverpool in January 2011.

'I'm an Interista and I would have preferred if he'd gone to Inter,' Chelsea boss Mourinho told reporters at a UEFA coaching seminar in Nyon.

'However, I hope that he does equally well at Milan. What I can say about Fernando is that as a person and a professional, there is nothing to doubt about him.

'He's a fantastic boy and a great professional. However, he needed a change of scenery.'

Torres has officially begun life as an Milan player, pictured in his first training session for the Italian giants.

The Spanish striker, who made 110 league appearances for Chelsea after joining the west London club, fell out of favour with Mourinho and was shipped out on loan last week for the remaining two years of his contract.

Upon joining Milan last Friday, Torres said of the move: 'I feel good, mentally strong. When everything goes well, you have more will power. I'm happy to train.'

'I can't wait to see the red and black supporters, to score for them and to win many titles.'

Torres will wear the number nine shirt for his new club, something the now-Milan man knows has a lot of history.

'It's an honour to wear the number nine jersey. (It) has been worn by some of Milan's great champions, I hope to be up there with them.'
