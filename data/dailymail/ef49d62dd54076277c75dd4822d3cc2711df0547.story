Families serving in the armed forces can often pass like ships in the night, but when two aircraft carriers crossed paths at the weekend, those on board were treated to a surprise reunion.

Husbands and wives, siblings, and even a set of twins were able to catch up over lunch together on Saturday, when the USS Harry S Truman and USS George H W Bush passed by in the Gulf of Aden.

For some, it meant the chance to spend precious time with loved ones, who they won't see again for at least 18 months.

Tender: John Miller hugs his wife, Nicolle Morris for the first time in eight months

There were tears of joy and laughter as family, who hadn't seen each other since July last year, were given two hours to spend together.

Sailors serving on Bush were airlifted to the Truman for the short reunion involving 28 sailors, while the ships transferred supplies.

For husband and wife Aviation Ordnanceman 2nd Class John 
Miller and Aviation Ordnanceman 2nd Class Nicolle Morris, it was the first time they had seen each other in eight months.

'I knew as soon as she came around that corner the tears would roll seeing her face again,' Miller said. 'That was homecoming for me.'

During the visit he have his wife a Truman T-Shirt sprayed with his cologne, so she would have something to remember him by.

But, as the time came for her to return to her own ship, it was hard to say good-bye.

'I just held on to her,' Miller said. 'It was tough to hold back because we know it will be several more months until we see each other again.'

The reunion, where the family members were treated to dinner in the petty officer mess, also brought twin sisters, Lieutenants Linda and Brenda Sharpe back together.

'I feel like itâ€™s Christmas right now 
being able to see my sister at the end of a deployment,' Linda 
Sharpe, told WTKR. 'Not everybody gets the chance to experience this, so it feels 
like the best gift ever.'

It took the Navy several months to plan the reunion, which gave those on board the chance to see relatives on Bush, which will be out to sea when the Truman comes home.

'What better way to finish strong than 
to see those loved ones that you wonâ€™t get the opportunity to see at 
homecoming as Bush begins their deployment,' Truman's Command Master Chief  
R D Kemp said.

'We have reunited 
brothers, sisters, husbands and wives who are going 18 months without 
seeing one another.'

David Brownlee, an Aviation Boatswain Mate on the Bush, said the visit gave him the chance to catch up with his brother.

'This opportunity tells
 something about the leadership here, allowing us to come see our 
families one more time,' he said.
