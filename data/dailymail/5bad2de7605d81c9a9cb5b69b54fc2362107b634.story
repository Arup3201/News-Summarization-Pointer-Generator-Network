A glamorous care worker stole nearly £10,000 to go on a fashion spending spree, a court has heard.

Laura Nichols, 26, of Houghton, Pembrokeshire, plundered the bank account of a vulnerable 41-year-old man she was looking after while working as a team leader for a care company.

Nichols admitted theft after stealing £9,831.99 over a year-long period from the man’s bank account - and spent the money on her love of fashionable clothes, shoes and handbags.

Ellie Morgan, prosecuting, told Haverfordwest Magistrates’ Court: ‘Police found clothes, shoes and handbags at her parents’ house. Nichols said she had bought them herself.'

However, Miss Morgan added that she 'admitted supplementing her account with the stolen money’.

Her victim could not manage his own finances and received 24-hour care at his home in Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, the hearing was told on Tuesday.

Hearing: Nichols appeared at Haverfordwest Magistrates' Court on Tuesday and will be sentenced next month

Nichols had full control of her victim’s finances because he could not remember his PIN to use a cash machine, the court heard.

Large sums of money had been withdrawn across Pembrokeshire and in Cardiff - and withdrawals were made when the victim was visiting his parents in France.

Jonathan Webb, defending, said Nichols had a second job at a pub but still found herself in ‘financial difficulties’. She will be sentenced at Swansea Crown Court next month.
