From the hockey sticks gathering dust in the attic to the gym kit lying forlornly at the back of your wardrobe, most of us have splashed out on at least one sporty item that hasn't made the grade.

But rather than let her old yoga mat go to waste, one unimpressed gym-dodger decided to give her cast-off a new lease of life.

Anjelika Paranjpe, creative director of innovative craft website Brit + Co, came up with not one but 20 different ways to make it happen.

Not using your yoga mat? Why not convert it into a useful case for your iPad or laptop

Anjelika Paranjpe, creative director of 
innovative craft website Brit + Co, came up with not one but 20 
different ways to turn an unwanted yoga mat into useful bits and pieces

'After years of downward dogs and sun salutations, it's time to retire your very first yoga mat,' she explains via the website.

'As it turns out, yoga mats are 
ridiculously versatile for repurposing, from flip flops to laptop covers
to keychains to koozies!'

Along
with koozies (America's version of for beer holders and coffee mug warmers), Paranjpe also managed to whip 
up everything from mouse mats and hair ties to clutch bags and bottle 'corks' using just her old yoga 
mat and some scissors, string and superglue.

Not that you need them for everything. Paranjpe's simplest idea was to reuse the whole mat by turning it into a lining for a drawer.

Making a coaster is also an easy option 
according to Paranjpe, who says they are 'perfect for absorbing 
the perspiration of an ice-cold glass of water - cut to a size that works
for your glasses and you're done'.

Paranjpe's electric blue mousemat and slippers are both made from a discarded yoga mat, and her online tutorial is just one of many on innovative craft website Brit + Co

Even more helpfully, your brand new 
coaster will also double as a jar opener - something that Paranjpe 
discovered when faced with a recalcitrant jar of of Smucker's Caramel 
Topping.

'This was made out
of pure necessity here at Brit HQ,' she explains.

'We couldn't get the 
darned Smucker's Caramel Topping open and grabbed the closest thing 
around, which happened to be a yoga mat. Those grips are still good for 
something!'

Much more 
impressive was the surprisingly stylish chair cover, which despite 
looking like something Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen spent hours on, is 
actually relatively easy to make.

'We recommend using paper bags to create a templates,' she advises. 'Trace onto the yoga mat using a coloured pencil, and cut!

'If you want to attach, punch a hole on each side and use string, shoelaces, or ribbon.'

Other
ideas included place mats, a laptop case, a bottle stopper and knee 
pads. Any thin shreds left over can be turned into hair ties. Waste not,
want not!

Other home-furnishing ideas include creating a seat cover or protecting floors with yoga mat scratch pads

Paranjpe's online tutorial is one of many on Brit + Co, an innovative website teaching people how to get creative at home, be it with a pair of scissors, a bottle of nail polish or a frying pan.

The website, founded by Brit Morin in late 2011, is 'an online platform and e-commerce company that inspires and enables the digital generation to make'.

Morin, a former employee of Google and YouTube, works with a team of people to bring ideas, tips and pointers for getting crafty to site visitors. She has already been dubbed 'Silicon Valley's Martha Stewart'.

She says: 'The home is the center of our lives. It can and should be a more creative, functional and beautiful place for us to spend our time.

'The tutorials, apps, and products that we suggest here on Brit + Co. are designed with that philosophy in mind and it makes me (and my mother) overwhelmed with excitement to be able to share them with you.'

Although it looks impressive, making your own clutch bag from an old yoga mat is easier than it looks. All you need are superglue, scissors and a packet of popper fastenings, which can be picked up in most haberdashery stores, including John Lewis.

Paranjpe explains: 'You already knew that yoga was fashionable, but who knew you could accessorise with a yoga mat?

'Cut a large rectangle with a rounded top. Fold into a style you like, and measure where you want your snap buttons [popper fastenings] to be.

'Attach the snap buttons using super glue. Then glue the bottom part of the clutch (everything but the fold-over) on two sides using super glue. Ta-dah!'

Paranjike's creative ideas make recycling considerably more entertaining than usual... as long as you don't mind everything feeling a bit foamy...
