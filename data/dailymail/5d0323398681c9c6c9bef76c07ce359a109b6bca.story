A well-known Philadelphia mummer and his daughter have been arrested after allegedly beating and shooting a homeless man in a brutal attack that was caught on surveillance video.

Carmen 'Butchie' D'Amato, 62, and Rita D'Amato, 36, were filmed approaching the unnamed man, also 36, in the city's Queen Village neighborhood shortly before 3am on October 25, police said.

Shocking footage shows Rita apparently crouching into a batting stance, before striking the victim in the chest with a baseball bat, knocking him to the ground.

As he gets up and tries to run, Carmen, who was inducted into the Mummers Hall of Fame aged just 21 and served as captain of the South Philly Vikings, then seemingly fires two shots at his leg.

By the time police arrived at the scene near 2nd and Carpenter Streets, the D'Amatos had fled. Officers discovered the homeless man lying on the ground with a broken leg, NBC reported.

The victim, who Carmen and Rita reportedly believed may have been breaking into cars, was taken to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital for treatment. He is thought to have since been released.

On Friday, warrants were issued for the arrest of Carmen and Rita, who were spotted leaving their house earlier in the day wearing similar clothing to that of the suspects in the surveillance footage.

The pair reportedly surrendered to South Detectives at around 6pm that day. Officers later recovered two handguns at their home on the 900 block of South Front Street.

The D'Amatos have both been charged with aggravated assault, possession of an instrument of crime, reckless endangerment, and other counts, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.

Carmen was also accused of illegally carrying a gun, while Rita was charged with tampering with or fabricating physical evidence. Investigators believe she tried to erase or modify the video footage.

During a police interview, the victim claimed the woman in the surveillance video told him: 'You know what you did, you son of a b****', before swinging the bat. 

Although there have recently been a string of car break-ins in the area, police are yet to confirm whether the attack was related to those incidents, CBS Philadelphia reported. 

In 1988, Carmen, who turned the Vikings from a beleaguered club into a powerhouse team, was indicted on charges of conspiracy to manufacture and distribute meth and defrauding the IRS.#

He was later acquitted of the drug charge, but jailed for four years for tax fraud. Before his sentencing, more than 40 people reportedly sent in letters of support for the mummer.

Weapon: During a police interview, the victim claimed the woman in the surveillance video told him: 'You know what you did, you son of a b****', before swinging the baseball bat (believed to be pictured at the scene)

Neighborhood: The homeless man was discovered near 2nd and Carpenter Streets (pictured), Queen Village

During his time in prison, Carmen continued to plan the Vikings' performance in the Fancy Brigade Division, helping them to place first in the competition that year, the Philadelphia Daily News said.

Carmen is believed to remain in police custody on $350,000 bail. Rita was released after posting 10 per cent of her $150,000 bail, according to court records.  

The pair are due to appear in court on November 18 for their preliminary hearing.
