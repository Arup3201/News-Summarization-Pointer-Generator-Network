Standing amid the ruins, a child gazes at the devastation war has brought to his home in Syria.

Once Deir al-Zor was a busy town in the eastern part of the country, with a growing tourist industry, but when rebels moved in, it became a target for tyrant President Bashar Assad's forces.

Pounded day and night by government artillery, many of the beautiful buildings have been reduced to rubble by the blasts.

In a scene looking like a film set from an apocalyptic future, fallen drainpipes lay across the road and dust fills the air.

Rebels took the town's strategic military base and airport which was once linked to the Syrian capital of Damascus.

Now there is no childhood for the youngsters caught up in the conflict.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has called on foreign powers to take action as violence keeps escalating between the warring sides.

On Friday, five people died after a night of bombardment by regime forces as they tried to push back rebels in the suburbs of Damascus.

In Barzeh, three children, a woman and an elderly man were killed in overnight shelling, according to a local activist network. Videos posted online, showed bodies of dead and injured under rubble.

Activists also reported shelling in the neighborhoods of Erbeen and Moudamieh, where four people, including two children, were discovered on their farm after overnight shelling.

In the suburb of Hammeh, it was reported that a man had died under torture after being detained byÂ  regime forces.
