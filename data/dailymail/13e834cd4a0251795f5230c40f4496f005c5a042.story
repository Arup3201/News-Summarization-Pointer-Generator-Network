Nigel Thrift, of Warwick University, saw his pay rise 21 per cent to £288,000 last year

University chiefs enjoyed pay rises of up to  21 per cent last year as students struggled with  spiralling tuition fees.

Vice-chancellors of the elite 24 Russell Group universities saw their salary and benefits increase by £10,175 – more than 4 per cent – to £277,000 in the year to August 2012.

Their total pay packages, including pension contributions, averaged £311,000 – up from £308,000 in 2010/11.

The biggest annual rise was awarded to  Warwick’s Professor Nigel Thrift, whose pay rose 21 per cent, or £50,000, to £288,000.

At York, Professor Brian Cantor won a 12.5 per cent rise to £251,900 while at Bristol, Professor Eric Thomas, who is also president of Universities UK, went up 11 per cent to £282,000.

Durham’s Professor Christopher Higgins saw his pay rise 10 per cent to £232,000.

The highest-paid head in 2011/12 emerged as Professor David  Eastwood at Birmingham, whose pay was up  1.1 per cent to £372,000.

The salary rises, uncovered in an analysis by the Times Higher Education magazine, were awarded as universities prepared to increase maximum tuition fees to £9,000 a year from September last year – up from just over £3,000.

Meanwhile, lower-ranking university staff received a flat pay increase of £150.

Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, said: ‘One rule for upstairs and another for downstairs seems to be the order of the day.’

At Durham University, Professor Christopher Higgins saw his pay rise ten per cent to £232,000

She accused vice-chancellors of ‘hypocrisy’ over pay and pensions.

‘While staff have seen their real-terms pay fall for successive years, many vice-chancellors and principals have had their snouts firmly in the trough,’ she said.

A spokesman for the Russell Group said its bosses led ‘complex multi-million-pound organisations’ that collectively contributed tens of  billions of pounds to the economy.

Wendy Piatt, director-general, said that attracting the best leaders was ‘crucial if our universities are to continue to excel in a challenging economic climate’.
