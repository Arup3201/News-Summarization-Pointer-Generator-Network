Premier League and Football League ticket prices rise at THREE TIMES the rate of inflation as the staggering cost of following your team is revealed

Sports Minister Helen Grant has warned that clubs must not take fans for granted with their ticket prices, which a new survey shows have risen at twice the rate of inflation since 2011.

Fans of Premier League clubs are also paying almost four times the amount for a season ticket compared with supporters in Germany, according to the BBC Sport Price of Football study.

Arsenal topped the list for the most expensive matchday ticket at £97 and dearest season ticket at £2,013

The average Premier League season ticket costs £508 compared to £138 in the Bundesliga - Bayern Munich fans can pay as little as £109.65, and in Spain Barcelona fans can get a season ticket for just £103.38. Arsenal is the most expensive club in Europe to watch via a season ticket, ranging from £1,014 to £2,013.

The survey shows that the average price of the cheapest match-day ticket across all four divisions is £21.49, up 13 per cent since 2011, compared to a 6.8 per cent increase in the cost of living.

Grant told BBC News: 'I can see why fans are cross. I'm cross, and I feel that clubs really must not take their fans for granted.

'To take a family of four to a Premier League match now, you're talking about £130. That is just not affordable for most families, so clubs really do need to look at this.'

Manchester City have the cheapest season ticket in the Premier League, starting at £299.

The cheapest match-day ticket in the Premier League has risen by 15.8 per cent, 31.7 per cent in League One and 19 per cent in League Two. Only in the Championship has it dropped - by 3.2 per cent.

Chelsea have the highest-priced cheapest match-day ticket of all Premier League clubs

Arsenal have dropped their most expensive match-day ticket from £126 last year to £97.

Chelsea have the highest-priced cheapest match-day ticket of all Premier League clubs - prices at Stamford Bridge begin at £50.

At QPR, where adult tickets can cost as much as £70 for Category A matches, chief executive Philip Beard said his club's priority lay in filling their ground and their prices were fixed accordingly.

Rangers also offer tickets to Category C matches from as little as £25 at Loftus Road - whose capacity of 18,100 is the smallest in the Premier League, leading to plans to relocate to a new stadium in the nearby Old Oak area.

Beard told BBC London: 'We liaise with fans on pretty much everything and when it comes to ticket prices, we want to be fair.

'The most important thing is that every single seat at Loftus Road is filled for every single game.'

Derby and Sheffield Wednesday both boast £10 match-day tickets - the cheapest in English football and only matched by Southport in the Conference.

The study also shows the average price of the cheapest match-day ticket in Scotland's football's top flight has increased by almost eight per cent since 2011 - from £18.92 to £20.42.
