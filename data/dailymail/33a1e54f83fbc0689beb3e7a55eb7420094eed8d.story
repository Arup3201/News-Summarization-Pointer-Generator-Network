Scourge of the high seas: This 40ft pirate ship,
named The Gypsy Rose II, took eight months to build. It carries up to 
30 passengers, has two bedrooms, luxury bathroom, fully-fitted kitchen 
and can travel at 17mph

Someone tell that parrot to shut up: Tim Woodson, left, known as Captain Tim, from Ballwin, Missouri, built the boat, pictured right, and he has just sold it to U.S. television network The History Channel for a cool $80,000

Captain Tim had put his creation - really a modified river boat - on the open market before U.S. television network The History Channel snapped it up..

'I've always been a fan of boats and I'm also an artist,' said the 53-year-old. 'I always wanted to put my two passions in life together to create something spectacular.

'I went out one day and wanted to find an old boat that I could transform into something really cool. My girlfriend asked, "What are you going to do?" and I said that I wanted to build a pirate ship.

'Everyone thought I was crazy but then they saw it and said how amazing it was.'

Labour of love: Captain Tim said building the 
ship - which is really a modified old river boat, was an opportunity to 
combine his twin passions as an artist and a lover of boats 'to create something spectacular'

Captain Tim revealed there was a lot of interest in the ship, but he was thrilled when The History Channel bought the boat.

'People would phone me every day to try and buy the ship or trade it for something,' he said. 'But we've just sold the Gypsy Rose II to the History Channel for $80,000, which is great.'

Captain Tim uses his unique ships to take people on pirate cruises along the Mississippi River.

Every summer he embarks on more than 100 cruises from St Charles, Missouri, to Grafton, Illinois.

He also hosts adventure-packed parties for children and booze-fuelled ones for adults aboard his boats as they glide through the beautiful southern scenery.

What a life: Captain Tim says he loves his job. 'At the moment I'm a full-time pirate and ship builder - it's great!'

'It just brings smiles to everyone's face, it's a great feeling and I love what I do,' said Captain Tim.

'The journey takes 30 minutes and everyone loves it, people can't wait to get on the ship and take photos.

'We take the kids out and search for real-life lost treasure. I love my job, at the moment I'm a full-time pirate and ship builder - it's great!'
