The popularity of the monarchy has soared to all-time highs following the birth of Prince George, a survey has revealed.

The Queen is enjoying unparallelled public support as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have reinvigorated interest in the Royal family, particularly among the young.

Three quarters of the British public believe the newborn prince will one day become king, as the public confidently predict the monarchy will endure.

Soaring popularity: 74 per cent of people think Prince George, held by his mother Kate, will one day become king

Two years ago a quarter of people said the country will be a republic within the next 50 years, compared with just nine per cent now, the ComRes survey for the Sunday Telegraph found.

The Royal family have enjoyed a surge in popularity on the back of Kate Middleton's wedding to Prince William two years ago.

A series of importance events - the wedding, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the royal birth - have kept them firmly in the public eye.

Popularity: 26 per cent said the Queen was the member of the Royal family they most admired, making her the most popular royal

Not even the controversy surrounding nude photographs of Prince Harry in a Las Vegas hotel room last year has dampened enthusiasm for the family, according to the survey.

Following the death of Princess Diana in 1997 after her divorce from Prince Charles, support for the monarchy slumped to historic lows.

But by the time the Queen's Golden Jubilee came around in 2002, the family's popularity had already recovered.

The public believe that Prince George will become king even though his turn is unlikely to come for more than half a century.

The survey found that 53 per cent believe Britain would be worse off without the royals - and only 14 per cent believe that the country would be better without them.

Today the most popular royals after the Queen are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, along with Prince Harry.

But a significant proportion say Prince Charles should not accede to the throne when the Queen dies.

The survey found that 38 per cent of people are in favour of Prince William being the next King - compared with 42 per cent who said it should be Charles. 

Future king? 38 per cent of people said Prince Charles should not become king and the Crown should instead jump a generation straight to Prince William

Asked which member of the Royal family they most admire, 26 per cent of people said the Queen, 19 per cent the Duke of Cambridge, 17 per cent Prince Harry and 12 per cent the Duchess of Cambridge.

Just four per cent said Prince Charles - and only one per cent opted for his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall.

However, 40 per cent said the Queen's £36.1million Sovereign Grant does not represent good value for money - compared with 43 per cent who said that it does.

ComRes questioned 2,005 adults about their views on the monarchy on July 24 and 25, just after Prince George had been found.
