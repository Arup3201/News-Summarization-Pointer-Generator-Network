Christmas diners seeking new ways to impress their guests have caused a spike in demand for over-sized bottles of wine and Champagne.

Sales of magnums, which are twice as large as a standard 750ml bottle of wine, and methuselahs, which contain eight bottles, have risen over the festive period.

Waitrose has reported sales of magnums have risen 122 per cent compared to the same period last year and now stocks 17 varieties.

Getting busy with the fizzy: Supermarkets have reported a spike in the sale of large bottles of Champagne, such as magnums and methuselahs, with some costing more than £250

Right, a Lanson White Label Methuselah, containing eight bottles, and a magnum (two bottles) of Prosecco available for £11.99 from Aldi

Sales of one magnum of red Bordeaux- a £35 bottle of Chateau Pey de la Tour - have risen by 230 per cent.

Ken Mackay, Champagne buyer at Waitrose, said: 'We’ve seen a real increase in customers buying magnums in the run up to Christmas – whether bought as a gift or shared with party guests, they're a fun centrepiece and definitely add the wow factor to any festive gathering.'

Waitrose also sells a Perrier-Jouet Belle Epoque Champagne magnum for £255. For those who prefer spirits, the supermarket also sells a magnum of Grey Goose Vodka for £120. 

Sainsbury's also reported more a spike in big bottle sales, such as a Moet & Chandon Champagne magnum costing £68.

After high demand for Magnums of Prosecco, an Italian sparkling wine, last year, Tesco has introduced more large bottles, including methuselahs, which contain about 50 glasses.

Magnum force: The sense of occasion that comes with the opening and pouring of an over-sized bottle of wine is one of the factors behind the spike in sales

The full range: A quarter bottle (or piccolo), a half bottle, a standard, a magnum, a Jeroboam, a Methuselah, a Salmanazar, a Balthazar and a Nebuchadnezzar

Laura Jewell, Tesco's master of wine, told the Times: 'Each methuselah requires two people to carry it and so there is a certain element of theatre created around the opening and pouring from the bottle.'

Yesterday it was reported that supermarkets are slashing the cost of champagne this Christmas with bottles of bubbly are on offer for as little as £8.

Many are touting quality wines and champagnes at half-price in an attempt to compete with budget retailers like Aldi and Lidl.

Asda sparked the price war by cutting the price of Pierre Darcys champagne from £24.25 to just £10, giving customers almost a 60 per cent saving with an offer that runs until January 1.

Tesco responded by knocking two-thirds off the official list price of award-winning Louis Delaunay champagne - from £25.99 to only £8, making it the cheapest on offer in Britain until the deal expired on December 2.

Wine bottles range from piccolos, which contain a quarter of a regular bottle, to a melchizedek, which contain a volume of wine equivalent to 40 bottles.
