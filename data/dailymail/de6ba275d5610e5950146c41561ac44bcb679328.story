Stuart Lancaster's injury-hit England squad looked focused as they were put through their paces in preparation to face New Zealand in the Autumn opener at Twickenham.

England welcome the All Blacks to the home of rugby on Saturday as the first of four internationals to be played this month as part of the QBE Series.

And despite the squad being depleted by injury the fit and available players enjoyed a training session in the Autumn sunshine at Pennyhill Park in Surrey on Tuesday.

Head coach Lancaster will be without a number of notable absentees for the entire series with Joe Launchbury the latest name to pull out of the fixtures against New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia with a neck injury.

England are already missing Geoff Parling, Alex Corbisiero, Mako Vunipola, Tom Youngs, Dan Cole, Ed Slater, Tom Croft and Manu Tuilagi for the series, and Launchbury's absence will be heavily felt.

Dave Attwood is set to deputise for the injured Launchbury against New Zealand, but even the 27-year-old's availability is not assured after he left the camp on Tuesday to attend the birth of his first child, but England are hopeful he will return in time for Saturday's clash.

Uncapped George Kruis is on standby to line up alongside Courtney Lawes in the starting XV if Bath second row Attwood is forced to miss the QBE Series opener at Twickenham.

'Dave has gone home, his wife's in labour,' forwards coach Graham Rowntree said.

'They've both promised me their baby will be delivered in the next couple of days! Hopefully that will be sorted for the weekend.

'He's in his car and on his way home, so good luck to them both.

'We'll deal with this day by day. We'll assess it on Thursday morning.'

Attwood has been earmarked to start after Joe Launchbury was ruled out of the autumn appointments with New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia with a neck problem.

Stuart Lancaster has remained positive despite the growing list of absentees and insists the squad is in good shape

Captain Chris Robshaw was all smiles at the session as he shares a joke with a team-mate

If the 27-year-old's fiancee Bridget gives birth in time, he will have the opportunity to make a third successive appearance against the All Blacks after winning two caps as a replacement on the June tour.

'We're very confident in Dave. The Tests against New Zealand in the summer gave him a taste of high-class rugby,' Rowntree said.

'He enjoyed it and he's gone back, got himself very fit and shed some weight.

'His game involvement has increased sufficiently and he's played exceptionally well in Bath's pack, so I'm more than happy with him.'

England's depleted second-row stocks - Geoff Parling and Ed Slater are also missing for the entire autumn - has potentially given Kruis the opportunity to shine.

Rowntree is confident Kruis is ready to win his first cap against the all-conquering world champions and views England's front-five injury crisis as an opportunity.

'George has been outstanding. We've been watching him for some time but he's come in and exceeded my expectations,' Rowntree said.

'I was a big fan to start with, but I can't praise him enough, how he's got up to speed with things.

'He's actually leading things in terms of the line-out area.

'He's exceptionally confident and fit, he's one of the last forwards to finish the endurance tests.

Attwood (pictured) left the camp on Tuesday to attend the birth of his first child, with England hopeful he will return before Saturday 

'We have some big names missing. We have virtually a pack of British and Irish Lions who will be sat at home on Saturday.

'But I've been here before and I've seen guys take their chances.

'What better time to do that than against the All Blacks at Twickenham?

'What a great opportunity for these guys to come in and give us more questions and selection headaches. I want these headaches and guys putting their hands up. This is another opportunity for that to happen.'
