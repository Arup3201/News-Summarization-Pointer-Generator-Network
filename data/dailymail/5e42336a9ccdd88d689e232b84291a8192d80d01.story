North hat-trick

Wales needed to force the pace in Rome after half-time to have any chance of claiming the title, and Lions wing George North touched down three times in 10 minutes to light the fuse.

Sarto consolation try

A sustained spell of breathtaking Welsh attacking play was partially undermined by the last-minute, long-range strike by Leonardo Sarto, which cut their winning margin and revived English and Irish hopes of taking the title.

Hogg miss

Ireland ultimately had cause to appreciate this key incident. Having gained the margin they needed, Scotland’s Stuart Hogg seemed certain to score late on, but fumbled the ball over the line.

Tight call

France wing Noa Nakaitaci broke clear and tried to run behind the posts. Under pressure from Ben Youngs, he touched down just as his foot crossed the dead-ball line, but the TMO sided with him.

Last big push

From one final penalty, England kicked to the corner, won the line-out and drove on with Twickenham in full cry. But just short of the line they were penalised and the title was gone.
