David Simpson, 73, died from a minor fall after being wrongly prescribed a mixture of medication which prevented his blood from clotting 

A dementia sufferer bled to death after a minor fall because doctors failed to notice that his medication prevented his blood from clotting, an inquest has heard.

Retired gardener David Simpson, 73, was wrongly prescribed a combination of drugs which, when taken together, reduced his body's ability to clot blood.  

But a 'systemic failing' meant doctors at Royal Blackburn Hospital, Lancashire, 'ignored' the problem on two occasions, only taking a proper blood sample when it was 'too late'. 

The 73-year-old had been taken to hospital after falling from a chair while at Hollymount Nursing and Residential Home in Blackburn.

At an inquest into his death, coroner Michael Singleton said Mr Simpson would not have died as a result of the fall if doctors had recognised the problem caused by the particular mixture of drugs.

He said there had been opportunities for hospital staff to notice the abnormality, but that they failed to take a proper blood sample in time.

He has now vowed to write to bosses at the hospital trust, warning that action should be taken.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Mr Singleton said: 'I will be sending a report to the chief executive of Royal Blackburn Hospital pointing out the problems with regards to the taking of blood samples and their analysis, and indicate to them that appropriate action should be taken to resolve what I believe to be a systemic failing.'

Speaking after the inquest, Mr Simpson's 63-year-old wife Pat said she felt 'very let down' at what she had heard.

She said: 'It was not just one slip up. It was the doctor with the wrong medication and it was twice with the bloods.

'Nobody is perfect and they seemed such a good crowd at the hospital, and I couldn't fault anything, but I feel very let down by what I heard at the inquest.' 

The court heard how Mr Simpson, who had gone to the home in April, had been prescribed warfarin following a stroke. He was later prescribed miconazole, an anti-fungal agent, for cellulitis.

But the inquest heard it had been a 'personal failing' by Mr Simpson's doctor to prescribe two medicines which, when taken together, increases the anticoagulant effect.

This means Mr Simpson's body's ability to blood clot was severely affected.

After falling from the chair in August this year, Mr Simpson was taken to hospital.

The inquest heard how there were no physical signs of massive abdominal bleeding.

But an international normalisation ratio (INR) check would have told doctors Mr Simpson's blood was not clotting properly, the court was told.

The coroner heard how doctors tried to collect blood on two consecutive days in order to take a reading.

But, when they could not collect enough blood, they 'ignored it rather than go back and take another blood sample', the court heard. 

Mr Singleton said: 'That seems to me a systemic failure rather than an individual failure.

'There is no system in place that says if you take out a blood sample and it's insufficient then, rather than simply ignore it, you should go back and take another.

Mr Simpson died at the Royal Blackburn Hospital, Lancashire (pictured) in August, after doctors failed to take sufficient blood samples on two occasions  

'One cannot speculate as to whether, in fact, had the INR been capable of being collected on the first occasion and vitamin K provided, the outcome would have been different.

'Whatever chance he had he lost by the failure to do that.'

When they finally managed to test Mr Simpson's INR at the third attempt, medics discovered it had rocketed from a usual 2.6 to more than 12. 

Mr Simpson was given treatment but his heart stopped on Monday, August 18, three days after being taken to hospital. 

Mr Singleton said: 'He simply bled to death internally.

'The relatively minor fall would have itself not have caused any significant injury had it not been for the fact blood-clotting agents were such that - once there was a minor bleeding from a minor blood vessel - it simply did not stop.

'There was an opportunity to deal with that at the Royal Blackburn Hospital because on admission they took a blood sample to do the full blood count, but there was insufficient taken to collect the INR.'

The retired gardener was staying at Hollymount Nursing and Residential Home, Blackburn (pictured) when he fell from a chair and was taken to hospital 

He added: 'In terms of the prescribing of miconazole, that seems to me is a personal failing. There is plenty of literature out there that doctors ought to know. It seems to me that is where the problem started.'

Mr Simpson's wife, Pat, who lives in Darwen, told the court that Mr Simpson had developed dementia after a stroke.

He had gone into the care home after two previous short stays for respite care.

In a statement, care assistant Kathleen Boardman told the court she saw Mr Simpson 'slide off a chair' onto a carpeted floor.

He was given painkillers after complaining of pain in his left groin, but had no visible injuries, she added.  

Mrs Simpson met her husband when he moved over to Jersey in the 1970s.

They were married for 38 years and had three children: Owen, 41, Rhea, 34, and Sylvia, 40.

She said: 'He was a keen cyclist. He was very fit and active until his stroke. His dementia progressed quickly. It was a shock because my husband was a very intelligent man.

'It's like losing him twice because he went in the home in April and I had to learn to be without him then too. I feel guilty because I wonder if he had been at home, would he have died?'

Dr Ian Stanley, acting medical director at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'We offer our condolences to Mr Simpson's family.

'The trust is currently undertaking an investigation into the circumstances around Mr Simpson's care and treatment so we are unable to comment at this time.

'Dr Roberts, the consultant who is carrying out the internal investigation, has offered to meet with Mr Simpson's family again to ensure that we keep them fully informed during this investigation and the subsequent findings.'
