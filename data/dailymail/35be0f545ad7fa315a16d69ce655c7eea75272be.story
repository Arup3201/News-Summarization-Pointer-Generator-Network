A Scottish World Cup fan seen defiantly cheering on England's rivals last night has been identified as a Formula 1 engineer from Glasgow.

In stands packed with blue-shirted Uruguayan supporters, Mark McConville was seen wearing a tartan hat and an orange wig, celebrating what might be England's early exit from the tournament.

Mr McConville, a contractor for Mercedes, was spotted on Twitter by relative Paul Hamilton who today confirmed his identity.

Mr McConville, an avid Scotland fan, decided to support the South American side when
Scotland failed to reach South Africa in 2010

Mr McConville's parents, Andy, 68, and Isabell, 66, from Glasgow, said they had recognised their son on the TV immediately.

His mother, Mrs McConville said: 'I was watching it with my family and we were looking out for him as we knew he would be there.

'It happened that fast - the camera just goes round the crowd and then we saw him. Then one of my friends sent a photo of it to my son, and suddenly it was everywhere.'

She added: 'I suppose it is a bit odd - but he always probably thought he would be on the television.'

Generous: Mr McConville travelled to Brazil to carry out charity work, handing out replica football kits to children

His father,
 Mr McConville said: 'He's not an anti-English guy or anything like 
that, it would have been more just about the banter.'

Asked
 if the stunt was typical of Mark, he said: 'He's not a shy guy, let's 
put it that way. He's like any guy really when their going to watch a 
game - quite happy to put on the tartan gear and let everybody know he's
 Scottish.

He said Mr McConville was from Glasgow but was currently living in Northampton.

Mark decided to support Uruguay when Scotland failed to reach South Africa in 2010.

Avid follower: Mr McConville (pictured with other football fans_ supported Uruguay during the London Olympics in 2012

The 41-year-old once claimed to have kissed 500 Uruguayan girls after the penalty shootout that saw the team into the semi-final four years ago.

He is currently doing charity work in Brazil, donating old football strips to an orphanage in Sao Paulo.

Mr
 McConville's cousin, Alan Ruddy, took to Twitter saying the 
41-year-old had been in Brazil for three weeks delivering football tops 
to orphanages.

Mr
 Ruddy wrote: 'He spent the first two weeks delivering football tops he 
collected to a Brazilian orphanage in the Amazon jungle. He is a massive
 Celtic fan and carried over dozens of CFC tops.

Adopted fan: He has followed Uruguay during a number of major tournaments and happened to stumble across a ticket for last night's victory over England

Career: Mr McConville left his job as an engineer at Mercedes (pictured here at a racing event) to travel to South America

'He followed Uruguay four years ago in South Africa and now doing the same in Brazil.'

Mr
 McConville's friend Mike Newman also took to social media labeling him a 'superstar', and family 
member Dean McConville said:  'At last a famous McConville!'

Mr McConville, an avid Scotland fan, decided to support the South American side whenScotland failed to reach South Africa in 2010, Mr Hamilton explained.

Stills of Mr McConville seen holding a Saltire flag aloft during the 2-1 
loss spread across social media sparking mixed responses 
from football fans.

Even
 though he claims to be non-political, Mr McConville's show of 
patriotism brings back memories of Alex Salmond controversially waving 
the Scottish flag while watching Andy Murray at Wimbledon last year.

Some wanted to find out who he was, while others praised his act of defiance.

One
 England fan tweeted: 'That Scottish fan supporting Uruguay. Made me so 
angry. Next time Scotland qualify for a major tournament I’ll be in the 
opposition end.'

Supporters called for the Scot to be identified, before he was later named by his relative.

An
 opposition supporter wrote: 'That Scottish boy in the Uruguay end with 
the ginger jimmy wig on, Scotland strip and his flag has been 
immortalised up there with Wallace.

'Immediate change to Scottish referendum. Now seeking full union with #Uruguay.'

Another
 added: 'Hating the English enough to travel to Brazil when your team is
 at home purely to celebrate their failure? Awesome.'

Joe Morris sarcastically tweeted: 'First Scotsman to make it to the World Cup in almost 20 years.'

While another said:'Defo (sic) need to find him before the English do.'

Neil Sutherland wrote: 'Ah Engerland (sic) now we have someone to blame.'

The
 picture made its way to the Twitter account of the cultural movement 
for Scottish Independence where one Twitter user asked if the Scot was, 
'the new Smeato'.

The
 question is seemingly a reference to John Smeaton a former baggage 
handler at Glasgow International Airport who became involved in stopping
 an attack there in 2007.

Controversial: Even though Mr McConville claims to be non-political, his waving of the Saltire during the World Cup game brings back memories of Alex Salmond's show of patriotism at Wimbledon in 2013
