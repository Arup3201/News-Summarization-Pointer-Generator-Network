Prison officer Sophia King-Chinnery has been jailed for ten months after having a secret lesbian romance with an inmate serving life for murder

A female prison officer who had a secret lesbian romance with an inmate serving life for murder has been jailed for ten months.

Sophia King-Chinnery, 25, embarked on the relationship with inmate Sarah Anderson after she had been jailed for stabbing a cyclist to death.

The pair exchanged hundreds of love letters in which Anderson referred to the prison officer as her 'wife', Southwark Crown Court has heard.

But the inmate was left distraught after hearing rumours King-Chinnery was cheating on her with somebody else.

Anderson, 31, was ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years in March 2009 after being convicted of stabbing Dee Willis, 28, in the neck in Peckham, south east London.

The 14-month relationship started in November 2011 while Anderson was being held at Holloway women's prison in north London.

The court heard the relationship continued even after suspicious prison bosses warned King-Chinnery, of Surbiton, Surrey, to stay away from Anderson.

The prison officer allowed Anderson to have a mobile phone for eight months, between January and September 2012 so they could spend hours chatting to each other.

When confronted by her bosses in February 2013, King-Chinnery accepted she had an ‘emotional relationship’ with her jailbird lover after experiencing difficulties with her colleagues.

She admitted they had mobile phone contact, adding that her ‘judgement had been clouded’.

But prosecutor Andrew Howarth said: ‘Clearly the relationship went further than an emotional one.’

‘The letters made clear the nature of the relationship between the two women was sexual.’

Sentencing King-Chinnery, Judge Michael Gledhill QC told her: ‘You come from an exceptional family - how on earth does it come about that you are standing in the dock of this court?

‘I understand that in the time before you began your relationship with Sarah Anderson, you were at a low ebb.

‘But the fact of the matter is you were a prison officer and from the moment you became a prison officer, you were well aware of the rules, which don’t include having any sort of personal relationship with the prisoners that you are supposed to be looking after.

‘No doubt that has been emphasised time and time again.

‘You knew Sarah Anderson was in possession of a mobile phone and you did nothing about it at all, on the contrary you used that in order to make contact with her whenever you chose.

‘I don’t find any grounds to suspend your sentence. A message has to be sent out to prison officers who have done what you have done, form a relationship with a prisoner, that they will be sent to prison.

‘I’m aware you will have a much harder time than others when serving your sentence but you brought that on yourself.’

Sporting a half-shaved head with a mass of curls and wearing a black suit, King-Chinnery sobbed as she was led out of the dock.

Her family and friends wept in the public gallery as the sentence was passed.

The judge handed Anderson a concurrent three-month prison term.

She spent 28 days in segregation after the mobile phone was discovered.

The phone is still at large after Anderson refused to disclose its whereabouts.

Judge Gledhill told her: ‘You knew perfectly well prisoners are not allowed to have mobile phones.

‘There is no evidence the phone was used to commit any form of crime but no doubt that phone was available to others to be used.’

Rachel Bright, defending King-Chinnery, told the court: ‘It’s right that she was in a relationship with Sarah Anderson at a time when she was vulnerable.’

Jacqueline Samuels, for Anderson, who is now serving her time at HMP Bronzefield, added: ‘The offence for which she was convicted occurred when she was 25, she was involved in a violent incident with another girl which resulted in that girl’s murder.

‘This defendant has always protested her innocence and there is a possibility of another appeal.’

Anderson, a hair-dresser by trade and mother to a 12-year-old son, was ‘desperately depressed’ when King-Chinnery befriended her.

Ms Samuels said: 'She willingly became involved in this situation.

‘(King-Chinnery) sent numerous love letters, and in return, this defendant sent letters.

‘She is genuinely distressed by the way things worked out and the fact that the co-defendant may have had a relationship with someone else as well.’

King-Chinnery admitted two counts of misconduct in a public office.

Anderson admitted causing the transmission of a sound or image from prison.
