A British Airways pilot who died at 43 after complaining he was being poisoned by toxic fumes on passenger planes may have been right, according to new research.

Richard Westgate, from Edinburgh, suffered years of ill health including severe headaches, mental confusion, sight problems and insomnia before he died in December 2012 at the age of 43.

Just before he died, he instructed lawyers to sue BA for health and safety breaches, convinced his problems were related to his being exposed to toxic chemicals on board the planes he flew.

Now, new scientific research has provided compelling evidence that exposure to cockpit air contaminated with hazardous organophosphates caused his death.

BA pilot Richard Westgate, 43, died after complaining he was being poisoned by toxic fumes in the cockpit

Lawyer Frank Cannon, who was instructed by Mr Westgate before his death, said: 'We believe that constant exposure to fuel leaks in planes contributed to Richard's death. 

'This scientific research proves that Richard suffered from chemicals called organophosphates which cause chronic brain and other problems.

'This happens because of constant exposure working aboard aircraft.'

The new findings - the results of a wide-ranging study which took in evidence given by Mr Westgate -  have just been published in the Journal of Biological Physics and Chemistry.

They show that scientists found organophosphates did affect Mr Westgate's health. 

Mr Westgate, a world record-breaking paraglider, died within days of the death of fellow BA pilot Karen Lysakowska, 43, who also claimed she had been poisoned by contaminated air.

Mr Westgate, who was not married and had no children, died  in Amsterdam, having stopped there for treatment on his way to Swiss suicide clinic, Dignitas.

Records from the Civil Aviation Authority reveal that pilots and crew have to put on oxygen masks at least five times a week to combat suspected 'fume events'.

Mr Cannon's Glasgow-based firm, Cannons Law, is acting for 25 people who believe they are suffering ill-effects from hazardous fumes on planes.

Another BA pilot, Karen Lysakowska, 43, also died in December 2012, and claimed she too had been poisoned

Pilot John Hoyte, head of support group the Aerotoxic Association, is among those who believe the fumes are endangering the health and safety of crews and passengers, and is campaigning for toxic air detectors on board all flights.

He said: 'Countless air crew and passengers are suffering, but this scientific report finally gives us the recognition that exposure to toxins from oil fumes can cause serious illness.'

Last year, a pilot flying from Heathrow to Philadelphia was forced to make an emergency landing at a remote military base in Canada after toxic fumes seeped into the cockpit.

And last month, three cabin crew went off sick after complaining about fumes on a flight from Heathrow to Newcastle.The problem was found to be caused by oil dripping into a motor at the rear of the plane.'

A BA spokesman said: 'It would be inappropriate to comment or speculate on the cause of death of an individual.

'The safety and security of our customers and crew are of paramount importance to British Airways and will never be compromised.'

Warm air is pumped into jets from the engines to provide a comfortable environment. But chemicals in engine oil can also enter cabins, despite safety devices meant to stop fumes, causing a condition called aerotoxic syndrome.
