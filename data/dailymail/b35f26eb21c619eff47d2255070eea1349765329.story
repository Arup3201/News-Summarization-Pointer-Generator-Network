England trained at the sports campus of Barry University with temperatures rising and an ibis stalking around in the penalty area when the players arrived.

On a training pitch fringed with palm trees the FA set out a wreath in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings.

The same wreath will be taken to a ceremony in the city later in the day.

Gary Neville set out the cones, balls and bibs with the help of his back room team.

All
 the players were out split into two groups, a mix of positions doing 
ball work under the supervision of fitness coaches Chris Neville And 
Tony Strudwick as the keepers did a shot stopping exercise in the goal.

All
 players present except Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain trained. The Arsenal 
midfielder trained alone inside Barry University's training base as he 
continues his rehabilitation, while the other 22 players, plus standby 
duo Jon Flanagan and John Stones, took to the field in sweltering 
conditions.

The
 mercury tipped 30 degrees Celsius in Miami Shore, where the humidity 
was 49 per cent - not far off the conditions expected in Manaus for the 
World Cup opener against Italy on June 14.
