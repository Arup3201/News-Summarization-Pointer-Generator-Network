Relationship counsellors and lawyers have dubbed today 'Divorce Day' as it is the time when most couples file for divorce. 

A quarter of parents have secretly considered separating from their partner and the first day back from the festive break is when they are most likely to act on their feelings. 

After months, or even years, of thinking about it, the stress of a frenetic Christmas and the start of the New Year, are the catalyst for relationship breakdowns. 

After months or even years of thinking about divorce, the beginning of January is when couples act on it

Andrew Newbury, head of family law at Slater & Gordon, told MailOnline: 'We see a real spike in people enquiring about divorce in January, with twice as many than any other period. 

'There are a whole host of reasons for this. One is the hot-house pressure of Christmas, with couples cooped up who might also have had too much food and too much alcohol. 

'Two weeks at home can put pressure on couples and if expectations on Christmas are not met there can be a sense of disappointment which can lead them to look at their lives. 

'Some people also discover affairs around Christmas with a text message on Christmas Day or the announcement of a new relationship. 

'For others, they have been thinking about divorce for a few months or a year and they make it a New Year resolution to finally file for divorce to have a new start.'

Now a support charity is calling on couples to bring in experts to help them repair their relations. 

A poll by OnePlusOne charity found six in 10 people in a relationship admitting to having problems, but only 23 per cent had never sought help from friends, family or professionals. 

Less than five per cent had turned to a professional therapist or counsellor or a support service for help.   

OnePlusOne Director Penny Mansfield CBE said: 'People rarely decide to separate or divorce suddenly – often they've been thinking about it for months, if not years.

'Seeking help at an earlier stage – when the first thoughts about separation creep in – can be the first step in resolving problems and make the likelihood of splitting up less likely.

'But for many people, the additional stress of Christmas and the start of the New Year bring these underlying problems to the surface, and they make their final decision to part.

'Separated parents who are able to communicate with one another effectively and are able to work out arrangements about money and the children early on have the best chance of preventing their children becoming stuck in the middle of their disputes.' 

A quarter of parents have considered separating from their partner and January sees a rise in enquiries

Government figures show that more than half of parents say they find it hard to access the support they need to agree future childcare arrangements when they separate. 

And a recent poll of children aged 14 to 18 with divorced parents found a third said their parents had tried turning them against one another during their dispute.

Jo O'Sullivan, Family Solicitor at O'Sullivan Family Law, who advises relationships charity OnePlusOne said: 'We definitely see a peak in enquiries about divorce in January and by the time people come to us for legal advice, emotions can be running high.

'In TV dramas we see battling parents fighting custody and childcare issues out in court, but court should only ever be a final resort.

'Alternatives to court, like family mediation and collaborative practice, reduce the stress of a split on children and lead to better outcomes.'

OnePlusOne is urging parents who are thinking of separating, or have already done so, to visit its website and find out more about its free courses, help and support.
