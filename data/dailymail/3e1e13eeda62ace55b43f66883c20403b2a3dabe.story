Barack Obama is facing poll numbers that are now in the same territory as President George W. Bush's following Hurricane Katrina.

The Quinnipiac University Polling Institute released numbers on Tuesday showing that just 38 per cent of registered voters approve of the job Obama is doing as president, with a whopping 56 per cent saying they disapprove.

The president has lost his landslide electoral edge among young voters, too, with a negative 41–49 per cent rating among 18- to 29-year-old voters. His once formidable support among Hispanics has also evaporated: They now support him by an historically small 50–43 per cent margin.

Worse for Obama's fast-approaching legacy-building years, the public believes he is not 'honest and 
trustworthy,' by a 52–44 per cent score. A smaller majority, 51 per cent, said he lacks 'strong leadership qualities.'

Respondents said by a 41–38 per cent gap that they would vote for a Republican over a Democrat for the U.S. House of Representatives, the first time this year Democrats have had a winning posture in the Quinnipiac poll.

Majority Leader? Mitch McConnell, the leader of the U.S. Senate's GOP minority, would run Congress' upper chamber in 2015 if the public's feelings about who should run the Capitol hold up

And 47 per cent of voters said they would like to see Republicans gain control of both houses of Congress. The GOP can achieve that outcome if it holds the House and picks up seven Senate seats in November 2014.

Fully half of independent voters – those aligned with neither the Democratic nor the Republican party – said they would back a Congress completely under Republican control.

'President Obama could be pretty lonely during his last two years in office if voters decide they want Republican majorities in the House and Senate,' said Quinnipiac University Polling Institute assistant director Tim Malloy.

But Congress hasn't had an easy ride either: 74 per cent of voters disapprove of the way Congressional Republicans are doing their jobs. A smaller 67 per cent group says Democrats in Congress are also falling shirt of the mark.

Exhibit A: Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is presiding over a health insurance overhaul that has drawn catcalls and sighs from the public as its website flails and its sticker shocks hit home

Pollsters interviewed nearly 2,700 voters between Dec. 3 and Dec. 9, asking their opinions after a spate of positive news hit TV broadcasts and Internet news portals about jobs and the economy.

The results suggest the staying power of Obama's unpopular health insurance overhaul and his administration's controversial nuclear deal with Iran.

Even Democrats are beginning to doubt the president who famously promised hope and change: 18 per cent of them now say they're no fans of Obama's work in the Oval Office.

Malloy called the news 'a rousing chorus of Bah! Humbug! for President Barack Obama as American voters head into the holidays with little charitable to say.'

That includes his handling of specific issues. While Obama enjoys a 50–41 per cent positive rating for his handling of terrorism, that's the only issue Quinnipiac polled where he comes out on top.

He's under water on the economy, 37–59 per cent, 34–62 percent on health care and 42–49 per cent on foreign policy.

Iran, too, is making Americans uncomfortable. Just 40 per cent of registered voters say they approve of the White House's approach to the Islamic republic, whose expanding nuclear program is the subject of a deal brokered in November by the U.S. and five other nations. A larger 48 per cent group disapprove.

Americans are less disapproving of the agreement itself, by a 44–46 margin, and a 45–37 plurality say it will make America 'less safe.'

The only good news for the White House is that Americans support Obama's pitch to raise the minimum wage nation-wide.

Fully 69 per cent support hiking it by at least some amount, with 27 per cent opposed.  But the pollsters offered their interviewees three separate choices of how much to raise the minimum wage, compared with only one option to leave it alone.

GOP lawmakers cite economic studies that show minimum wage hikes have corresponded with job losses, particularly among low-skilled and minority workers, as companies let people go in order to comply with wage hikes without spending more money on human resources.
