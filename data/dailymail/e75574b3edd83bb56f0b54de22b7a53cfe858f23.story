Harry Redknapp has admitted he must use Bobby Zamora sparingly to control the QPR striker's chronic hip problems.

Rangers boss Redknapp hailed the 33-year-old's resolve for playing through the pain, but conceded the former Tottenham forward cannot last a full 90 minutes.

Zamora has battled rumbling hip complaints for almost two years, but Redknapp said QPR are fighting to keep him in action as long as possible.

'Bobby has been very important for us,' said Redknapp, ahead of Saturday's Premier League trip to Chelsea.

'After about 60 to 65 minutes he has to come off, but when he's on the pitch he has been outstanding.

'We were bringing him off the bench to start with, but we've reversed it and started him recently.

'He's been captain and great in the dressing room, I couldn't be more pleased with Bobby.

'He's got his hip but he manages it and when he plays he's been great and his attitude has been first class.'

Zamora proved a constant thorn for Liverpool's defence when QPR lost out 3-2 at Loftus Road despite a battling performance, and impressed again when Rangers saw off Aston Villa 2-0 on Monday night.

The Barking-born target man has added an extra focal point to QPR's attack, freeing up Charlie Austin and Eduardo Vargas to push for goal-poaching opportunities.

Redknapp managed to help Ledley King through persistent knee problems at Tottenham, allowing the England defender to play at times despite missing training entirely.

Former West Ham and Spurs boss Redknapp said Zamora is not quite in King's category yet, but conceded Rangers medics and coaching staff are keeping a close eye on his progress.

'Ledley didn't train at all to be fair,' said Redknapp.

'To think he didn't train one day and then play 90 minutes was unbelievable.

'It does take Bobby a few days to recover after a game, so it's always on how he feels.

'He's as good as anybody at doing what he does, holding the ball up and bringing people into play.'
