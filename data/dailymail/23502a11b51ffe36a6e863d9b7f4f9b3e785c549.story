Tiger Woods and Lindsey Vonn recently went public with their romance

The skiing star girlfriend of golfing legend Tiger Woods has become embroiled in controversy after it emerged she has made a number of visits to a sports facility overseen by a notorious former 'doping doctor'.

Olympic star Lindsey Vonn, who has been seeing Woods for several months, has visited to the Red Bull-owned Diagnostics and Training Centre in Austria, which is run by German doctor Bernd Pansold, 71, according to an investigation by the New York Daily News.

Pansold was one of hundreds of doctors at the forefront of a doping epidemic in the former East Germany, which fed unwitting young athletes hardcore performance enhancing drugs like anabolic steroids in what was a state-sponsored programme in the 1970s and 80s.

While there is no suggestion alpine ski champion Vonn, who is sponsored by Red Bull, has ever taken PEDs - and has never failed a dope test - her visits to Pansold, who runs the lab in the village of Thalgau, shows how vulnerable today's Olympic stars are to the murky past of doping.

When confronted with suggestions Vonn has been a visitor to the facility, her publicist initially denied it, but later acknowledged the 28-year-old had undertaken tests at the lab and had exchanged nothing more than pleasantries with the doctor.

It is thought she made visits to have physiological tests, including blood-lactate analysis.

Pansold, in an interview in March, confirmed Vonn had visited his facility twice a year and called her a 'very nice girl'.

He emphasised the primary influence behind Vonn's training programme is Red Bull trainer Martin Hager.

Vonn, winner of four World Championships, has been sponsored by the energy drink company since 2005, which is said to give her a number of perks, including other state-of-art training facilities at the company-sponsored Salzburg football team's headquarters.

What is unclear is how much Vonn and her handlers know about Pansold's questionable past.

Thousands of fledgling athletes suffered at the hands of the East German doctors, and it is thought Pansold was at the heart of a programme which plied female competitors with highly dangerous muscle-strengthening drugs.

Girls as young as 13 were given the toxic Oral Turinabol without their knowledge.

The victims suffered side effects such as deepened voices, cancer, ruined ovulation cycles and an increase in face and body hair growth.

In 1998, Pansold was convicted of aiding and abetting assault for his part in the programme.

He has admitted in the past that, 'It's very clear I was part of this system. Iâ€™m a known guy, but there are 200 or 300 other people you can ask'.

He was hired by Red Bull in 2000 and is now a specialist in analysing physical testing data to see how performance can improve. There is no suggestion he continued to be involved in doping since the East Germany scandal.

Red Bull did not respond to the paper's request for comment about the doctor, while Vonn has not been made available by her handlers to talk about him.
