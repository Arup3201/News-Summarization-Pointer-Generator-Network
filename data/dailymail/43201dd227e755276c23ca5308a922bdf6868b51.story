A two-year-old British girl drowned in a Spanish holiday villa swimming pool as her mother sunbathed nearby, an inquest heard.

Patrick Crump, 38, from Ludlow Shropshire, told how he found Isabella May Crump floating in the water of her grandparent's pool in San Miguel de Salinas, Alicante, in August last year.

Her mother Deborah Ridgway, 27, had been lying on a sun lounger facing the other direction at the time, the hearing heard.

Mr Crump dived in and pulled his 
daughter, known as Izzy, from the water and desperate efforts were made 
to revive her. But tragically she was pronounced dead when paramedics 
arrived.

South Shropshire deputy coroner Andrew 
Barkley said it will probably never known how she came to be in the water.

Both parents told the court Izzy and her older sister had been drilled not to go in the water alone and to always wear armbands if they did.

A distraught Mr Crump told the inquest 
that he and his eldest daughter had gone inside leaving his wife and Izzy 
stayed outside for a 'cuddle' on the sun lounger.

He said: 'The programme we were 
watching had finished and I said to my daughter "right, we need to go 
and get changed for tea. I will go and see what Debs and Izzy are 
doing".

'I went outside and saw Debs on the sun lounger, facing away from the water, and Izzy in the pool.

'Izzy knew she was not supposed to go into the pool without her water wings.'

The inquest held at the council 
chamber in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, yesterday heard that the family had been staying with Deborah's grandparents Arthur and Thelma Keeley, who owned the holiday home.

They had spent most of afternoon enjoying the pool - a day 
before they were due to fly back to Britain.

Ms Ridgway told the inquest: 'Both of them were told not to go near the pool unless either me or Pat was with them and they were wearing armbands.

'Izzy would even say it back to me.'

Speaking at the time, Izzy's grandfather said: ''We are all totally devastated. The brightest light in our lives has been switched off.'

Deputy coroner Andrew Barkley said: 'Clearly she was playing in and around the pool, and appeared to understand she was not allowed in the pool without at least one of her parents or without armbands.

'Exactly how it was she ended up in the pool will, I regret to say, never be known.'
