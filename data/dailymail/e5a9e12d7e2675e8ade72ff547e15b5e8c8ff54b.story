Tara Moss, seen here in Sydney in 2011, has claimed she was the victim of a random attack in the city's CBD on Wednesday

'I was punched by a stranger while crossing the road alone on Market Street and Pitt Street in Sydney CBD around lunchtime, near Hyde Park.

'The man who attacked me appeared to be highly agitated and drug affected or mentally unwell, and the attack was brief, random and completely unexpected.

'I do not believe I was specifically targeted for any reason,' Ms Moss said.

The incident took place on busy Market Street, near Hyde Park, around lunchtime.

Soon after the assault, Moss took to twitter to express her shock and alert fans.

The 40-year-old wrote on Twitter that she was bruised after being 'hit by a man in the street'.

Ms Moss visited clothes store Jacqui E, who she is a brand ambassador for, before the attack. She posted this picture of herself modelling on Instagram, writing: 'Just freaking out my fellow Jacqui E shoppers at the Sydney City store. As you do.'

She approached a police officer on George Street about the incident but did not want to report the attack, police say.

'Was just hit by a man in the street. He's on Market St in dark clothing headed toward Hyde Park. Slim/white. Beware. Suspect drug affected,' Ms Moss tweeted.

The model described how the man was wearing 'dark casual clothing, perhaps 6ft, travelling alone'.

She added: 'Don't approach as I suspect he is drug affected.'

Ms Moss said: 'Have spoken to police who will patrol the area - he fits the desc of a known perp. In the meantime be careful in Hyde Park, CBD area, folks.

'I'm bruising up but fine. Random attack. Police are looking for him. In the meantime be careful in Hyde Park/CBD area.'

Tara Moss warned her Twitter followers about the attack

The author of nine novels, who has more than 38,000 Twitter followers, replied to concerned comments from her fans on Twitter saying: 'I'm okay. It was a random attack. Worried about others so speaking to police now.'

NSW police told MailOnline they have received 'no formal' report from Ms Moss over the incident.

The Daily Telegraph claimed that a police officer was too busy to help Ms Moss, however NSW police told MailOnline that a police officer spoke to her but she did not want to take the matter further.

'Police were dealing with an unrelated matter and were informed of the incident.

'She provided basic details, however she did not want to make an official report. She was provided with a Victim's Card and encouraged to report it,' they said.

A police spokesman said police patrolled Hyde Park after the incident but were unable to find the man.

Canadian crime writer Tara Moss is currently a PhD candidate at the Department of gender and cultural studies at the University of Sydney

Ms Moss has used the experience to raise awareness to the broader issue of domestic violence.

'I am often reminded that such attacks are rare compared with violence that occurs far too commonly behind closed doors, usually by people known to the victim.

'Incidents that take place behind closed doors do not usually have witnesses, or get such attention,' she wrote.

Ms Moss is currently a student in the city, studying for a PhD at the Department of gender and cultural studies at the University of Sydney.

She lives about 50km away from Sydney's CBD with her husband Dr Berndt Sellheim and their young daughter Sapphira in the Blue Mountains.

She was recently in the spotlight after appearing on the ABC's Q&A program where she broke her silence over her own experience of sexual assault and rape.

In her latest book, The Fictional Woman released in June, Moss takes a more personal route, exploring the challenges facing modern women.

Earlier today the former model posted this picture on Instagram from Angel Place, she wrote: 'The birds are chirping'
