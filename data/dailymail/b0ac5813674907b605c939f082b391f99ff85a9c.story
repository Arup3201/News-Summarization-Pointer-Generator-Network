Boden Hughes sparked a blaze by smoking cannabis on a ferry to Amsterdam putting the lives of more than 1,000 passengers and crew at risk

A passenger has admitted starting a fire on board a ferry which at the time was estimated to have caused a massive £815,000 worth of damage.

Boden Hughes sparked a blaze by smoking cannabis in cabin 568 of the DFDS north sea vessel on December 28, putting the lives of more than 1,000 passengers and crew at risk.

The boat which had been en route to Amsterdam and was 30 miles out at sea was forced to return to the Port of Tyne and people had to be winched to safety.

Some needed treatment for smoke inhalation.

At Newcastle Crown Court yesterday the 26-year-old, from Sunderland, pleaded guilty to arson being reckless to life being endangered and affray.

At the time the damage he caused was estimated to have cost £815,000 - but the exact figure will not be revealed until a later hearing.

His guilty pleas are on the basis he had discarded a lighter he was using to heat cannabis resin onto a pile of clothes on the bed.

The lighter, which has been adapted to produce an ongoing flame, caused the clothes and bedding to quickly catch fire.

Prosecutor Ian Lawrie QC said: 'It was a spectacular piece of recklessness.'

Mr Lawrie said Hughes was in such a “drink and drugged” state he was unable to do anything about the fire he had started once it took hold.

Hughes will be sentenced for the arson offence, along with a cable theft conspiracy he had already confessed to, in September.

Judge James Goss Qc told him: “Be under no illusions as to the seriousness of the crimes you have admitted today.

'This was very serious offending which will attract a substantial sentence of imprisonment.'

Hughes had tried to avoid being brought to justice over the fire when his defence team made an application last month claiming the English courts had no jurisdiction to try him on the charges.

Christopher Morrison, defending, said the alleged offence happened outside British territory, which extends 12 miles out to sea.

But Judge Robert Adams ruled that the English court does have jurisdiction, despite the alleged offence happening 28 miles out.

The judge said legislation under the Merchant Shipping Act and the Senior Courts Act state that British citizens accused of offences at sea can be tried under English law.

Judge Adams said: 'The court does have jurisdiction to try this case.'

James Curry, 29, of Calshot Road, Castletown, Sunderland, admitted a public order offence and common assault in relation to what happened on the boat.

He will be sentenced with Hughes.

Passengers on a crossing from Newcastle to Amsterdam complained of being 'treated like animals'

Both men have been remanded in custody.

Two crew members and four passengers had to be winched off the DFDS Seaways vessel after breathing in smoke as a blaze took hold in cabin 568.

A further 15 passengers and eight crew members were treated by doctors for smoke-related injuries after the incident.

The ferry was forced to return to the Port of Tyne, where Hughes was arrested.

Some 946 passengers and almost 130 crew were on board the Amsterdam-bound ferry.

Family members hugged in relief at the ferry terminal when they were finally allowed off, with some vowing never to sail again.

Julie Bell and Shaun Richardson, from Washington, Tyne and Wear, were on a weekend away.At the time she said: 'It was like a scene from a movie, a chaotic mess, horrible.

'It was terrifying and I won’t be travelling by boat again. I think I will stay in the UK from now on, it’s a lot safer.'

RAF helicopters from Leconfield near Hull and Boulmer, Northumberland, were scrambled to the vessel along with RNLI lifeboats from Bridlington and Filey.

As he was led away, Hughes, dressed in a grey sweatshirt for the hearing, said: 'Thank you, Your Honour.'
