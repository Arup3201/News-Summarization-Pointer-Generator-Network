When shopping for clothes, customers usually check to see if they need a small medium or large.

But one Japanese clothing company has ditched traditional size labels in favour for some more literal descriptions.

Brand Fatyo offers its products in just four sizes - titch, skinny, fat and jumbo.

But rather than trying to offend its customers by suggesting they could be overweight if they are a size fat or jumbo, the company say they are trying to flip the meaning of the word 'fat'.

On their website, Fatyo say: 'FAT in other words, COOL.

'Being FAT. Wanting to be FAT. Striving to be FAT. That's the answer. The question is...

'What is FAT to you?'

Some Japanese clothing brands are known for having unusual sizes for their garments rather than the usual descriptions.

But it is thought these are the first that use the more descriptive terms.

Japan has the lowest obesity rates in the developed world, which is thought to be down to their diet of fish and vegetables and small portions.

Last year American retailer Abercrombie and Fitch came under fire for not offering women's clothing, which exceeds 'large' which is equivalent to a U.S. size 10.

However, after a petition in America, the company say they will be offering larger sizes and an expanded range of products to help its profits rise over the next year after its share price fell.
