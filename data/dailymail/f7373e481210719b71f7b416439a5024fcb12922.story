Prince Harry joined fellow officers and friends at a ceremony today where his grandmother the Queen presented new Standards to the Household Cavalry Regiment.

Standing on London's Horse Guards Parade in his best dress, the prince passed the time before the start of the ceremony by chatting with two friends.

Among the members of the Royal Family present during the ceremony were 
the Duke of Kent, Duke of Edinburgh and the Princess Royal.

The Queen braved the wet weather to inspect the troops and present the Standards, which are the brightly coloured banners that were once used as a 
rallying point on the battlefield. Today they aare embroidered with 
battle honours to remind officers and soldiers of the heritage of their 
Regiment.

Later in the day, Harry was at Buckingham Palace for his first garden party - joined by soldiers and officers from his regiment.

He was one of hundreds of officers and soldiers from the Household Cavalry Regiment who enjoyed the summer event staged in their unit's honour by the Queen, their Colonel-in-Chief.

Dressed in a morning suit and top hat and carrying an umbrella in case the low clouds brought rain, Harry mingled with the guests.

Around 5,500 servicemen and their families had been invited to the garden party - one of the highlights of the summer calendar for the Queen.

Harry met two servicemen from the Household Cavalry's Blues and Royals who are awaiting confirmation of an unusual world record - the highest game of rugby.

The pair - Captain Jack Barnes, 26, and Corporal of Horse Christopher Nicol, 30 - were part of a 28-man team of officers and soldiers from the Household Cavalry Regiment who climbed to Everest's base camp in March.

Capt Barnes, from Old Harlow, Essex, said: 'We played seven-a-side tag rugby at an altitude of 5,165m (16,946ft) in a lake bed.

'The Blues and Royals won 10-0 but it was really tough - it felt like your lungs were bleeding.'

The group filmed the match for official records and are awaiting verification of their feat.

After chatting to Harry, Capt Barnes added: 'I heard he was trying to get on to the trip but didn't make it. He was asking how we coped with the altitude sickness - which was incredibly hard.'

The garden party was held after the Queen had earlier presented new Standards to the Household Cavalry Regiment in a ceremony on Horse Guards Parade.

The garden party was also attended by the Duke of Edinburgh and the Princess Royal.
