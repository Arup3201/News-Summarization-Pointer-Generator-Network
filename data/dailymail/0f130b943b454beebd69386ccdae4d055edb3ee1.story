Marc Osborn was found guilty of three counts of 'filming a private act for sexual gratification'

A police officer secretly filmed himself having sex with three women he met on the internet and at work and then showed it to his colleagues.

Father-of-two Marc Osborn, from Sydney, now faces dismissal from the New South Wales Police force after being found guilty of three counts of 'filming a private act for sexual gratification' this week.

The court in Sydney heard Osborn had bought a clock with a hidden camera on eBay and recorded the women without their knowledge.

He then showed the films to his colleagues at the police station.

Osborn, 42, who has admitted filming himself having sex with three women, told the court that he only showed the videos to colleagues to prove 'the old man's still got it', Australia's Daily Telegraph reported.

The most explicit parts of the videos were downloaded onto his iPad and his phone and in one he could be seen winking to the camera.

The woman who testified against him said she trusted him because he was a police officer.

Downing Centre Local Court magistrate Janey Wahlquist was quoted by Sydney Morning Herald as saying: 'The evidence from his workmates, in the way he showed the films on his phone to them, indicated pleasure or gratification showing them the films of him having sex.'

The case came to court following an internal investigation by New South Wales Police.

The inquiry found he dated up to 33 women at the same time and met as many as four on one day.

He faces accusations he had sex in his marked police car and spent hours during his shifts at a woman's house.

One woman, known as Miss BB, is now suing the police force for failing to protect her.

In a statement she said: 'I feel very betrayed that [Osborn] used his position as a trusted member of the NSW Police to gain access to my home and my children', reported The Telegraph.

An internal investigation has been launched into Osborn, who has been suspended without pay.

He will be sentenced on September 26.
