A man set a Pittsburgh-area house ablaze, killing six people, including four children, in order to get revenge on one of the residents, officials said.

Ryan Williams, 24, was charged Friday with six counts of criminal homicide, arson and burglary for the October 18 house fire in McKeesport.

The blaze killed 55-year-old Ronald Egenlauf Sr, 27-year-old Hope Jordan and her four children, aged 2 through 7.

Arson: Ryan Williams, 24, set a Pittsburgh-area house ablaze, killing six people, including four children, in order to get revenge on the only survivor, Keith Egenlauf, 23, according to police

Williams allegedly told friends that he had stolen money and food from the house before setting a roll of toilet paper on fire and tossing it on the couch 

According to detectives, Williams started the fire in order to exact revenge on Jordan's husband, Keith Egenlauf, 23, the only one to survive the blaze.

A criminal complaint states that Williams was out to 'get Keith' because he believe Egenlauf had spoken with police after the paid had burglarized a home in 2013, according to police.

After the fire, Williams told a friend that he had gone to the home where Egenlauf was living and found the back door open, according to the document.

Williams walked up to the second floor of the house, took money out of a wallet and took food from the fridge before setting a toilet paper roll on fire and tossing it on the couch.

On the night of the fire, he phoned the same friend and said 'I just did some crazy stuff. I’m on my porch waiting for fire trucks,' as sirens were heard in the background, the complaint states.

Another witness told detectives that Williams woke him early the day after the fire and told him he had 'just lit Keith's house on fire, and if anybody asks, I was here all night.' 

Arrested: One witness told investigators Williams had phoned on the night of the fire saying he did some 'crazy stuff,' and woke up another the day after the home burned down saying he did it 

Children: Hope Jordan's children, ages 2 through 7, were found dead in an upstairs bedroom, though Williams claimed he didn't know anyone but Keith Egenlauf was home

Deceased: Keith Egenlauf (right) barely escaped the flames after trying unsuccessfully to save his wheelchair-bound father while his wife, Hope Jordan (left), ran to the children. 

One witness described how Williams cried after hearing on the news that the children had died, claiming he thought it was only Keith Egenlauf living in the house at the time.

On Friday, Williams told WPXI that he did not know the children were inside the house when he set the fire.

Egenlauf told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review he raced back into the house, trying to save his partially paralyzed father, Ronald.

'He could see I was in pain,' Egenlauf said, describing blistering heat around him as he tried to pull his father out of his wheelchair. 'I was screaming. I tried my best. He told me, "Get out."'

Though she had made it out of the house too, Jordan entered again and went upstairs for the children, Dominic Jordan, 7, Autumn Jordan, 6, Serenity Jakub, 3, and Victoria Jakub, 2.

Egenlauf said it was the first time in weeks the four were together with their mother.

Two of the children were in foster care and visiting Jordan, who was charged in 2013 with child endangerment for leaving them in filthy conditions with her boyfriend at the time, Andrew McGee.

'They called me "Dad,"' said Egenlauf, who would have celebrated his first wedding anniversary with Jordan in December. 'I treated them like my own. In my heart, they belonged to me.'

Egenlauf was taken to the hospital in critical condition on the night of the fire, suffering burns over 55 percent of his body he is still healing from, WTAE reports, 

Dawn McPherson, 37, Jordan's sister, said Williams deserves no mercy if convicted.

'I hope he can't sleep at night,' McPherson said. 'I hope he's haunted for the rest of his life. I hope God gives him everything he deserves.'
