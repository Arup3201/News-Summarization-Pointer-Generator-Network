Too far? 5-year-old Ethan Clos was sent home from kindergarten for his non-conformist Mohawk

A five-year-old boy was sent home from kindergarten because his Mohawk haircut proved too distracting to other students.

Ethan Clos was told he cannot return to class until he loses the distinctive haircut.

School officials said the hairstyle violated their dress code by being 'disruptive and distracting'.

His mother Keshia Castle said her son considered the haircut 'cool.'

'They seen his hair like it was. All the little kids were going over and feeling on it and everything,' Castle said.

But administrators at Reid Elementary School in Springfield, Ohio, were not so enthused.

Superintendent Gregg Morris said the hairstyle was a distraction for students and violates district rules.

Distraction: Clos's grandmother Joyce Wells, pictured, said the haircut is no different from the 'fade' but officials called it distracting

'Our
policy clearly states that any dress or grooming which is disruptive or
distracting to the educational process is not acceptable. In this 
particular case, the student’s hairstyle did provide disruption to the 
classroom,' Morris said.

Ethan’s grandmother, Joyce Wells, told
whiotv that the Mohawk is no different than other popular styles such 
as 'the fade,' a haircut in which the hair is cut down to the scalp or 
close to it on the sides and back of the head and hair is left on top.

Relenting: Th boy's family disagrees with the decision, but mother Keshia Castle said she'll shave her son's head to have him back in school Monday

'You
understand there’s a dress code and everything but you think this is 
perfectly acceptable? Right. I do, because if you look at the Mohawk and
if you look at the fade, there’s not much difference except he’s bald 
on the sides,' Wells said.

Castle said she kept her son home from school on Friday, but will shave his head so he can return to his class on Monday.
