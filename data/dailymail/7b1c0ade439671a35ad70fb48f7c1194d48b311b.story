The former head of BP has landed his first high profile corporate job four years after the Gulf oil spill which forced him to resign.

Tony Hayward will become non-executive chairman of multinational mining and trading company Glencore Xstrata, the firm announced.

It marks a remarkable comeback for the man who was at one point the most hated man in America.

In the wake of the biggest oil spill in history - which claimed 11 lives - Mr Hayward gave a speech in which he said: ‘There’s no one who wants this over more than I do. I would like my life back’.

Weeks later he was photographed on a boat during Cowes Week on the Isle of Wight whilst Americans on the Gulf coast saw their livelihoods ruined by the disaster.

Mr Hayward stepped down as BP chief executive soon after, in October 2010.

He was called to testify before Congress and during a bumbling performance he said that he could not remember even basic details 65 times.

Hayward was BP CEO when the Deepwater Horizon blew up off the Louisiana coast in April 2010

Among his other gaffes were the prediction that the environmental impact would be ‘very modest’.

He also told fellow BP executives at one point: ‘What the hell did we do to deserve this?’

The news of his new appointment was met with scepticism by some Glencore Xstrata observers including US-based Pension & Investment Research Consultants.

It said in a statement: ‘There are concerns over his time as chief executive of BP arising from (the spill) and possible time commitments due to ongoing legal proceedings in the US’.

Mr Hayward had previously worked on investment company Vallares and in 2011 joined Glencore PLC, one of the world’s largest commodities traders, which later merged with mining giant Xstrata to become the firm he is with now.
