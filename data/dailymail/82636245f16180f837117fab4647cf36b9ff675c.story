Barclays was accused of treating customers as ‘cash cows’ yesterday over controversial plans to sell their personal data.

Some 13.2million current and savings account holders will be affected by the move, buried in the small print of a letter sent to them last week.

It insists customers must agree to let Barclays share information about their transactions – the only way to opt out is to close their accounts.

Intrusion: Barclays bank has controversial plans to turn its customers into 'cash cows' by selling their data

Barclays’ letter said changes to its terms were being brought in from October to make them ‘clearer’, ‘simpler’, and ‘easier’.

But it admitted it will trawl accounts for information which it could then sell to other firms, government departments or MPs.

In a further intrusion, Barclays will also use ‘location data derived from any mobile device details you have given us’. Many customers are likely to have thrown the letter in the bin without realising that it says: ‘We can combine information about you with information about other Barclays customers to create reports which we may share with companies outside Barclays.’

Monitoring: Barclays will not allow its customers to be identified to third parties, but it will look through accounts for spending trends and other habits

It adds that it ‘can use information about the transactions on your account to increase our understanding of services and products that you may wish to use’, although customers can opt out of this part of the changes.

The banking giant insists the information will not allow any customer to be identified but will look for spending trends and other habits.

Barclays will also monitor a customer’s mobile phone to find out which country they are in – without their knowledge. The bank says this will prevent fraud, allowing them to find out whether a cash withdrawal in a foreign country is bogus, and the account holder’s exact location will not be identified.

Bad year for Barclays: Chief Executive Bob Diamond had to quit with immediate effect following a market-rigging scandal

Barclays insists its customers could benefit from their plans, as it could, for example, contact them to point out the amount they spend on their energy bill is much higher than other people in their postcode.

Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘This is yet more evidence of an arms race between big companies who are intent on selling out their customers’ privacy for their own profit.

‘Barclays is following in the footsteps of a host of companies who no longer see their customers as people to provide a service to but instead a cash cow for personal data, to be monitored and sold on to advertisers with little regard for asking people’s permission.’

Barclays said: ‘We only use information in a numerical, anonymised and aggregated way as is standard practice at many companies. It is not about providing information for sales or marketing use and does not include any personal data.

‘Personal data will never be passed on to anybody else without their explicit consent.’

Rival HSBC insisted yesterday  that it does not use customers’ information in this way. Sources at RBS said it does not sell its data and Lloyds Banking Group also denied the practice.

The controversy comes after a humiliating year for Barclays. It was fined £290million for its part in the rigging of interest rates and chief executive Bob Diamond was forced to resign.
