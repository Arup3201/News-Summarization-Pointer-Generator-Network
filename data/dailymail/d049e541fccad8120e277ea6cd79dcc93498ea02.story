Barcelona have agreed a £15million transfer fee with Arsenal to sign Thomas Vermaelen, in what will be a blow to Manchester United. 

The deal is now pending personal terms between Vermaelen's agent and the Nou Camp outfit before the deal can be finalised.

On Wednesday, Barcelona sent transfer negotiator Raul Sanllehi to London  and he had productive talks offering a four-year contract, with the option of an extra year, worth £80,000 a week.  

Agreed: Barcelona look to have beaten Manchester United to signing Thomas Vermaelen

No go: Arsenal wanted a swap deal involving United's Chris Smalling as opposed to a cash offer for Vermaelen

Turned down: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger had hoped to secure the capture of Smalling in the Vermaelen deal

Sanllehi left feeling he had done enough to convince Arsenal and the player that Barcelona was his best option. They now believe the player is '99 per cent' theirs. 

The news will come as a blow to Old Trafford boss Louis van Gaal, as United and Arsenal hit a stalemate over the proposed £15million purchase of Vermaelen on a three-year deal. 

Arsene Wenger is refusing to sell the Belgian defender to United unless a player comes in return with Chris Smalling top of his wishlist.

Wenger has admired Smalling since he was a teenager at Fulham and made overtures to sign him before United stepped in to strike a deal in January 2010. 

The Greenwich-born centre-back opted for Old Trafford and even though he has only shown glimpses of his potential United want to keep him and see how he develops under Van Gaal.

United's failed bid for Vermaelen will come as a blow to the player himself who was keen to continue playing in England.

The Belgian international has an English girlfriend, model Polly Parsons, and a young son, and the idea to be reunited with his good friend Robin van Persie at Old Trafford appealed to him greatly. 

The stand-off means Barcelona now have the edge unless Vermaelen pushes for the move to United. 

United have made it clear they will better Barcelona's offer but, with Arsenal refusing to deal with them unless Smalling is included, the pressure is now on Vermaelen.

His close friend Van Persie had the determination to push through a move to Old Trafford ahead of better offers but there is a sense Vermaelen will not take the same stance.

Barcelona look to have won the race and United will begin to look elsewhere.
