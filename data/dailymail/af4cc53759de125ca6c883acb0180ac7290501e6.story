A new range of antidepressants aimed at pets with behavioural problems could become available in the UK later this year.

Prozac-style drugs would help benefit 80 per cent of Britain's eight million dogs, according to a new study.

The research has found that the idiosyncrasies of man’s best friend, such as chasing their tail relentlessly and barking at the door even if nobody is there, are often born from psychological problems such as anxiety and phobic behaviour.

Problems: Dogs who bark at the door when there is noone there were among those said to possibly have behavioural conditions

The research found that eight out of ten dogs are now suffering from a range of behavioural conditions, including obsessive compulsive disorder.

The study found that vets are increasingly treating dogs for a range of conditions, such as anorexia, depression, sleeping problems and even ‘self-mutilation’.

Scientists also warned that other household pets such as rabbits, cats and parrots, were beginning to suffer from similar behavioural problems.

But critics have warned that labelling pets with such conditions and introducing Prozac-style drugs may simply be offering excuses for bad ownership.

Hyperactivity was the most prevalent problem among dogs, with 60 per cent of animals suffering from the condition.

It was found that 22.5 displayed traits associated with obsessive compulsive disorder, responsible for behaviours such as tail-chasing and excessive paw-licking.

A further 30 per cent of animals were also found to have ‘phobias’ or ‘fears’, while 12 per cent were found to have ‘separation-related problems’ when parted with their owner.

The scientist who conducted the study claimed that millions of dogs were suffering from psychological conditions.

Dr Claire Corridan collected responses from more than 1,300 dog-owners who observed their pets over a two-week period.

Dr Corridan, who belongs to the Companion Animal Behaviour Therapy Study Group, an affiliate of the British Small Animal Veterinary Association, said the problems were partly due to owners spending less time with their pets.

She said: ‘We are seeing more and more behaviour problems in our companion animals. We all have busy lifestyles, so quite often cats and dogs are spending less time with their owners and less time being socialised.

‘It’s now not such a big deal to say you are going to see a pet psychiatrist or behaviour counsellor.’

The leading vet said that relying on drugs to treat the problems could be dangerous and may not address the causes of behavioural issues in pets.

Critics have warned that labelling pets with such conditions and introducing Prozac-style drugs may simply be offering excuses for bad ownership.

Two behavioural drugs for animals already exist in the UK and a new product made by Prozac-developers Eli Lilly, is expected to be licensed later this year.

Beverley Cuddy, editor of Dogs Today, warned against ‘medicalising’ the behaviour of animals.

She said: ‘Maybe people are becoming a bit more perfectionist and want their dogs free of all negatives. But this means you are not tolerating normal doggy behaviour. There are lots of things you would prefer your dog not to do, but that is part of having a pet.

She added: ‘Also, if you medicalise your animal’s problem, it removes a bit of guilt and responsibility from the owner. You can say your dog is not a thug, he has a condition.’
