A 'terrifying' mid-air incident which resulted in Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall's helicopter being forced to make a 'hairy' emergency landing was yesterday blamed on a tiny broken metal ball.

The royal couple were en route to the Hay-on-Wye Literary Festival in Wales in May last year when their Sikorsky S-76C suddenly began to veer - or yaw - to one side.

With neither pilot able to balance the aircraft properly, its 53-year-old captain was forced to declare what is known as a 'Pan' emergency- one below a Mayday- and attempt to land at a nearby aerodrome.

Safe: Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and the Prince of Wales after another flight

A report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) into the episode, which was made public for the first time yesterday, said it was caused when a minute metal ball - just 2mm in diameter - housed in the system which controlled the helicopter's dynamics shattered.

This caused an internal leakage of hydraulic pressure which in turn led to the helicopter's yaw control system being dramatically restricted.

The report said the ball was 'mostly likely' to have fractured after the second in line to the throne and his wife took off from London.

A royal aide described the incident as being 'pretty hairy' and sources close to Camilla, who is a nervous flyer at the best of times, have since told the Mail that she was 'terrified'.

'It was genuinely terrifying' said one.

'The helicopter veered and there was apparently nothing they [the pilots] could do about it. It was a heart in mouth moment. The Duchess was very, very shaken.'

Remarkably, however, Charles and Camilla insisted on continuing their journey to Hay-on-Wye by car, arriving three hours late and, apparently, with smiles on their faces.

Neither alluded to their in-flight drama during the engagement and were reported look relaxed. Aides said they were determined not to let down members of the public waiting for them.

'They were unflappable despite what they went through. If anyone else had gone through what they did they would have cancelled their day,' said one well-wisher.

The 2009 manufactured helicopter, which contained the royal pair and four other passengers, including their bodyguards, as well as the two-man crew, left London at 9.30am on May 23 last year.

According to the AAIB report, it began to yaw to the right as it approached Denham aerodrome in Buckinghamshire.

The pilot immediately realised the helicopter to be 'out of balance' and conducted several checks on the system.

But when they realised there was nothing they could do to control it he decided to declare a Pan emergency - a less serious declaration than a Mayday - and briefed his royal passengers.

The two pilots attempted a 'running landing', which is often conducted if an aircraft has developed problems.

They managed to carry it out successfully and ground-taxied with the helicopter still yawing to the right.

The AAIB explained: 'A detailed metallurgical analysis of the ball by the (USA) National Transportation Safety Board is continuing. However, the most likely cause of the ball fracture was an anomaly in its heat treatment process during manufacture.'

The report said the part in which the ball had split - which was only fitted to the helicopter in February last year, three months before the incident - had been replaced after the Denham incident and the helicopter had subsequently flown 'without further incident'.

The AAIB said Sikorsky was in the process of issuing a safety advisory and a flight manual revision 'to inform operators of the symptoms of a PDTA fault and actions to be taken by the crew'.

Clarence House declined to comment further last night.
