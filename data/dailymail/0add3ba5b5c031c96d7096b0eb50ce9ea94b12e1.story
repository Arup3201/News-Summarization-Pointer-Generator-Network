Cosmetic surgery addict Sarah Burge is often in the news for her outrageous parenting behaviour.

The mother-of three hit the headlines in February this year when she admitted to buying plastic surgery vouchers as a present for her daughter Poppy's eighth birthday, and then again in June when she visited America in an attempt to launch Poppy on to the beauty pageant scene.

The U.S. trip backfired when 51-year-old Sarah was thrown off a chat show by disgusted host Anderson Cooper, but it seemed the ex-nurse didn't learn much and today she was back on the small screen boasting about the Christmas gifts she is planning for her daughters Poppy, 8, Hannah, 18, and Charlotte, 27.

Human Barbie Sarah Burge has revealed that she will spend £18,000 on her daughters' Christmas presents

Sarah, who runs her own cosmetic surgery clinic in St Neots, Cambridgshire and has had more than 100 cosmetic procedures costing over £250,000, appeared on This Morning to defend her outrageous gifting and revealed that she is planning to spend almost £20,000 on presents this year including designer clothes and bag, jewellery, ponies and - of course - plastic surgery vouchers.

Married Sarah will spend even more turning her house in to a Winter Wonderland to dazzle her two children.

She said: 'A lot of people do get in debt at Christmas but I can afford it.

'I have just coma back from Russia and bought some really expensive gifts including plastic surgery vouchers.

'It is the one time we can splash out. It will be like Santa's grotto in my house.

'They will be getting ponies, surgery vouchers, designer clothes, handbags, jewellery.

'The economic climate is affecting me too though, I have definitely had to cut back on what I spend.'

When This Morning hosts Ruth and Ealmon asked if spending so much money is just going to spoil her children, Sarah replied: ''They are not spoiled. I have it under control.

'Hopefully they will be able to maintain this lifestyle.

'Maybe I am setting them up for a fall in the future, but until then .. let's make the most of it!

'I work very hard for this money.

'We are all very happy, we have a nice lifestyle and do things that other people only dream about.'

Sarah says that she has been affected by the tough economic climate too, and has had to cut back on spending this year

Unsurprisingly psychologist Liz Fraser, also appearing on the show, disagreed with Sarah's present-giving ethos.

She said: 'Everyone has their own budget, but we are in a culture where we give so much at Christmas and that equates having things with happiness.

'It is our role as parents to teach children about the society we are living in, and now we are having a tough time.

'A recent Girl Guides survey questioned girls aged 10-17 about their happiness levels and the results were astonishingly low.

'One of the things that continually came up is the pressure that young children feel to have things and to own things.'

In 2010 Sarah caused controversy for giving her teenage daughter Botox

Sarah and daughter Poppy appeared on Daybreak in June to talk about Poppy's disastrous visit to the U.S.
