A wildlife park in the Netherlands is celebrating the rare birth of polar bear triplets.

The three cubs were delivered to mother Freedom at the Ouwehands Dierenpark zoo in Rhenen, Utrecht, on Saturday, and keepers have been keeping a close watch on the new family ever since.

The incredible moment was captured on CCTV cameras at the tourist attraction.

In a rare touching moment, the cameras caught the mama and her baby bears having a cuddle.

However, keepers have not yet approached the polar bears, so they don't know what gender the triplets are or how much they weigh. 

A post on the zoo’s Facebook page read, 'The birth of triplets is unique and rearing them is even very rare. The coming weeks so exciting.'

The father of the three cubs is called Victor and lives in Yorkshire Wildlife Park in the UK, after leaving Holland last August.
