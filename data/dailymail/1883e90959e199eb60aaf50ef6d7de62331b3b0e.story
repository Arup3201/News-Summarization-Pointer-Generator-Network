One of the Queen’s riders has been jailed for brutally attacking a love rival in a jealous rage after finding him at his former girlfriend’s house.

Jonathan Nolan, 32, was driven by ‘blind emotion’ as he repeatedly punched and kicked John Maxse, 45, during the late-night assault.

Ipswich Crown Court heard how Nolan had objected to his victim’s close friendship with his former girlfriend, Genevieve Hippisley, 26, who is the mother of his three-year-old daughter.

When police arrived, Nolan, who is a 
work rider for the royal trainer Sir Michael Stoute, was so covered in 
Mr Maxse’s blood that officers thought he himself was the victim of a 
serious assault.

Mr Maxse, a
former PR director for the British Horseracing Authority and the Jockey
Club, was left with bruises all over his body, a broken nose and a 
fractured eye socket that required surgery.

One police officer described his injuries as the worst he had seen in his career.

Nolan, of Newmarket, Suffolk, was jailed for four years yesterday after he admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

The
court heard Nolan and his former partner had been in a relationship for
several years, but that it had been ‘on and off’ in the year before the
attack, which occurred at around 11.30pm on July 21.

Richard
Kelly, prosecuting, said Miss Hippisley had got to know Mr Maxse, a 
former jockey and now a communications consultant for Qatar Racing, as 
they were both work riders for Newmarket trainer Michael Bell.

Nolan was
said to have had a problem with their friendship.

On
the day of the attack, Miss Hippisley sent a message to Nolan saying 
she was going to a party with Mr Maxse and asking him to babysit their 
daughter, but he replied saying he wanted to go to the party as well.

She then sent him ‘a stern text message’, accusing him of trying to control who she was friends with.

She
wrote: ‘I have tried not to hurt you but YOU AND ME ARE OVER NOW. You 
cannot keep me captive any longer and decide who I can be friends with. I
will make my own choices. Get on with your own life.'

Nolan sent a text back saying he did not mind who she was friends with and agreed to babysit.

That
night, Miss Hippisley went to a pub with Mr Maxse. After they returned 
to her house, Nolan appeared at the rear patio doors.

Mr Kelly said: ‘He
strode past Miss Hippisley and said something like “how could you or 
how dare you” before repeatedly punching Mr Maxse.’

Mr Kelly said 5ft 
6in Mr Maxse stood little chance against Nolan, who is 6ft 1in. 

Miss 
Hippisley tried to restrain her ex-boyfriend, but he shook her off and 
pinned his victim to the wall where he punched him again.

Mr
Kelly said: ‘Mr Maxse then fell to the ground and the defendant kicked 
him in the head a number of times.

Whenever Mr Maxse tried to explain 
what was happening, it further infuriated the defendant and he continued
the assault.’

Miss 
Hippisley raised the alarm and Nolan was arrested.

He admitted the 
assault, saying he had ‘simply lost the plot’ and had carried out the 
attack in ‘a dreamlike state’.

Charles
Myatt, defending, said: ‘There had been an emotional build-up over a 
number of months.

He saw Mr Maxse and blind emotion took over and he 
quite literally lost his senses.’

Miss
Hippisley declined to comment as she left court.

Mr Maxse, who was not 
in court, yesterday posted a picture on Twitter of himself after the 
attack, saying: ‘Today the person who did this to me is due in court for
sentencing.’

Nolan used to ride the Queen’s horse Carlton House when it was based at Sir Michael’s Freemason Lodge stables in Newmarket.

Out of character: The court heard Jonathan Nolan was turned from a placid, kind and non-violent man into someone 'governed by emotional rage'
