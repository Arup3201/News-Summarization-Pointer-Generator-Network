A former dominatrix of a multi-millionaire octogenarian has been taken to court by the elderly man's family after she was given more than $120,000 from him.

The New Zealand family said the woman, aged in her 50s, was a 'predator on elderly, lonely men'.

The man's wife of many decades told the court that it was six years ago when she was introduced to the woman by her husband. She was initially told the woman was interested in renting one of their properties to run as a brothel, reported stuff.co.nz.

The wife, who now lives in a nursing home, said she was not comfortable with the idea but her husband seemed very fascinated.

The man also discussed his interplays with the dominatrix and also complained to his daughter about the sexual relationship with his wife, the judgement said.

'He sat down and told me he was into bondage and discipline... he described his sessions with [the dominatrix] to me, being tied up and whipped,' the daughter said in evidence.Â 

Prior to that conversation the man's daughter thought her father had a 'typical Catholic attitude towards sex', the judgement said.

Inquiries by the family then found the woman had a history of financially preying on other older men.

The judgment said it was clear that more than $120,000 had been gifted from the man to the woman, which were earnings from his $20m real estate empire.

Judge David Brown ordered that a property manager be appointed to administer his property portfolio after finding that under the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act the man lacked competence to manage his own affairs.

He also noted that when the man was in court, he had quickly given a different explanation for how he met the woman - saying he responded to a dominatrix advertisement and went for a B&D session where the woman 'happened to be on duty'.

Then he claimed to have become her friend and supporter after meeting her later when she was on duty as a social worker.

Judge Brown said he was satisfied with the evidence that the dominatrix exerted 'undue influence' over the elderly man.

The parties involved cannot be identified as the man is considered to be in a vulnerable state.
