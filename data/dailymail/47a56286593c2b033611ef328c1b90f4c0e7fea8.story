Britain has suspended embassy operations in Kuwait City and urged UK businesses there to review security measures due to a terror threat.

It comes less than two weeks before a planned visit to the country by Prince Charles to mark the 50th anniversary of its independence.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We are aware of an increased terrorist threat against the British Embassy in Kuwait.'

'We have therefore taken the precaution of temporarily suspending embassy services,' she added.

Services will be suspended until at least after the weekend - the spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the closure is linked to the royal visit.

All non-essential staff have been sent home.

In a wider caution to Britons in the 
country, she said: 'We cannot rule out the threat against other British 
interests in Kuwait, and have therefore urged British business and 
organisations to review their own security procedures.'

UK citizens are also being warned to take extreme caution as a result of 'maritime restrictions' issued by Kuwait last month.

Prince Charles is scheduled to make a short visit to the Middle-East on October 31 and November 1 en route to Africa.

He will go to Kuwait to celebrate the 50th anniversary of independence as the guest of the Amir and the Crown Prince, and will then stop briefly in Qatar for discussions with the Emir.
