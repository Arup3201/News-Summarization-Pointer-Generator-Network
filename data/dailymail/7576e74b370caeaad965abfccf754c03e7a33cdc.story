Some men may be reluctant to wear jewellery.

But  a  ring that hides helpful fold-out tools in a similar way to a Swiss Army knife might just change their minds.

The ‘Man Ring’ contains a bottle opener, two blades for tasks like cutting packaging open, a tiny saw and even a comb for emergencies.

Be prepared! The ‘man ring’ (pictured left) contains a bottle opener, two blades for tasks like cutting packaging open, a tiny saw for pruning (right) and even a comb for emergencies

Designed by Bruce Boone in Georgia, it is crafted from aerospace grade titanium plates, which are held together with brass rivets. It has a brushed finish but is polished inside for comfort.

When slid off the finger it can be used as a variety of tiny tools by folding out different components.

For example, it has a bottle opener inside, as well as a straight blade for cutting tape or fishing line and a serrated blade for hacking though tough packaging.

Another fold-out metal plate has a miniature saw attached which can be used to cut plastic and wood. This image shows how effective it is when used on a pencil

Another fold-out metal plate has a miniature saw attached which can be used to cut plastic and wood.

There is even a tiny comb, which according to the firm, ‘does a surprisingly good job on the 'stache or head.’

The 9mm wide ring is available in a number of sizes at $385 (£255).

The firm says: ‘This utility ring is not to be confused with a toy. It is a finely engineered and crafted piece of functional art that anyone would be proud to wear.’

It also offers other ‘manly’ rings based on spanners, pistons and even handcuffs, as well a military dog tag necklace that also contains fold-out tools.

For men who don't fancy donning a ring but like the idea of having an emergency tool kit with them at all times, there is a TaskOne phone case that is fitted with 22 tools including a 1.8-inch (4.6cm) wood saw, 2.5-inch (6.4cm) removable knife and three screwdrivers.

It also comes with a wire cutter and stripper, six Allen keys, two stands to enable a user to use the iPhone as a TV, a ruler, a bottle opener and pliers.

The firm says: ‘This utility ring is not to be confused with a toy. It is a finely engineered and crafted piece of functional art that anyone would be proud to wear.’ It claims the tools are sharp and should be used with care (pictured left) but is comfortable and not overly bulky to wear (right)
