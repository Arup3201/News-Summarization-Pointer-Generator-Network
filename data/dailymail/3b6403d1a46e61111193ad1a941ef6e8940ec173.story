Barcelona won't be able to carry anyone when they face Real Madrid in a hugely anticipated El Clasico this weekend, but that's exactly what they were doing in training on Friday.

Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Javier Mascherano and Dani Alves all seemed to be enjoying themselves as they lifted Neymar off the ground at Ciutat Esportiva.

Messi and Suarez may line up for the first time together at the Bernabeu, as the latter finishes his four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup.

And Messi, who is close to breaking the all-time La Liga scoring record, can't wait to link up with Suarez.

'We are excited for Luis to play because he will add his strength to the team,' he said. 'I'm happy for him because he has spent a long time off the pitch.'

Barcelona said on Thursday that Suarez was 'ready' to play, but coach Luis Enrique has given no hint as to whether he will use the Uruguay forward.

Either way, Messi will have Neymar to accompany him as Barcelona looks to maintain their lead at the top of La Liga, and extend the four-point gap over Real.
