University student Katie Hill, 19, who was born 'Luke', and high school student Arin Andrews, 17, formerly 'Emerald', fell for each other after bonding through their shared experience of transitioning between the sexes.

The quest to highlight gender issues 
gave them a 'unique bond', while honesty has made

Katie, from Bixby, explained: 'We have a very unique bond because we've been through the same stuff, even though it was in opposite directions.

'But we're at a point in our lives where things are happening and it's harder to spend time together.

'I've started college and Arin will soon, so we don't see as much of each other.'

Brunette Katie had full gender reassignment surgery in 2012 costing $35,000 (£20,000).

A mystery donor heard she'd been targeted by bullies at school because she was changing gender and actually fronted the huge sum for her procedure.

'It's the best thing that has ever happened to me,' she said. 'I'd felt like a girl trapped in the wrong body since I was born.

'I finally saw what I wanted to see in the mirror and didn't burst into tears any more.'

Katie now loves living life as one of the girls and enjoys sessions at the nail salon. 'Getting my nails or my hair done helps me to keep my mind off the breakup so I'm just trying to embrace life,' said Katie.

'I'm pretty much like one of the girls,' she said. 'I get invited to sleepovers, asked to share apartments at university, none of them any of the wiser about it.

'It's amazing and it's not unusual. I've never been one of the boys.'

But while Katie is being one of the girls, Arin still feels he has more to do on his journey to become a man.

He regularly works out with heavy weights to sculpt his body and give him the masculine shape he craves.

Last year in June he moved one step closer to his dream body, having his breasts removed at a clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, after he started testosterone therapy in 2012.

However his parents, Mitch and Denise, faced a difficult situation when Katie recently initiated the breakup with Arin.

Arin's mum Denise, 43, a business owner, said: 'As soon as they broke up one of the first things that he started hounding me about was his genital surgery.

'There was a part of him that felt that he needed to have full reassignment surgery and finish his transition, because he'd be more attractive to girls like Katie.

'It was a real worry because female-to-male genital surgery is very risky. It's said to be more complicated than male-to-female.

'Also there is a serious danger with all surgery, however small the procedure. We didn't want Arin making a rash decision and his top surgery had made him so much happier, so we wanted him to keep enjoying that.

'We didn't want him to sink into depression like he suffered before he started his transition.'

Fortunately Arin reconsidered after the dust started to settle on his split with Katie. He said: 'The breakup did make me think about having the bottom surgery but that was more of an impulsive thing.

'I was emotional and thought I needed to do it, but I realise now it has nothing to do with why Katie and I were separating.

'The real reason is that we are just growing up and we need to focus more on ourselves instead of our relationship.'

Though he's deciding not to rush anything, Arin still hopes one day to have full genital surgery.

'It sure would be nice to have and not risk that issue in a relationship,' he added. 'I'd love to be married one day and have my own kids and have a kid that calls me their dad, even though I won't be able to have a conventional pregnancy with my partner.'

In a touching move, Arin and Katie have decided to remain firm friends and will continue to support each other.

Katie said: 'We think that's what's important is that we've been there for each other through the whole hard parts of it an now we can just focus on having fun and enjoying being who we really are.

'We've been so much we'll be friends for the rest of our lives. We couldn't imagine not being there for each other in some way.'
