A Japanese submarine that was preparing to attack the Panama Canal during World War Two has been discovered off the coast of Hawaii.

The 400-foot (122-meter) ‘Sen-Toku’ class vessel - among the largest pre-nuclear submarines ever built - was found by chance in August off the southwest coast of Oahu.

It has been missing since 1946 according to scientists at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

The I-400 and its sister ship, the I-401, which was found off Oahu in 2005, were able to travel one and a half times around the world without refuelling.

It could also hold up to three folding-wing bombers that could be launched minutes after resurfacing, the scientists said.

Sea-ing is believing: The submarine (pictured) was found by the Pisces V deep-diving submersible, while it was looking for other wrecks

The U.S. Navy captured five Japanese subs, including the I-400, at the end of World War Two and brought them to Pearl Harbor for inspection, the scientists said on Monday

'The submarine was torpedoed, partially collapsed and had sunk at a steep angle,¿ said Delgado, an archaeologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which helped to fund the dive.

U.S. forces sank the Japanese submarines and 
claimed to have no information on their precise location, in an apparent
 bid to prevent their technology falling into the hands of the Soviet 
Union

Formidable: An I-400 class submarine, similar to the vessel found off the Hawaii coast

The accidental discovery of the craft 2,300ft beneath the surface, has solved the mystery surrounding a ship long thought to be further afield.

‘We came upon this as we were looking for other targets ... It is like watching a shark at rest,’ said Jim Delgado, a researcher aboard the Pisces V deep-diving submersible which traveled to the wreckage.

Mystery solved: The I-400 (sister vessel pictured) had been missing since 1946

U.S. forces sank the submarines and claimed to have no information on their precise location, in an apparent bid to prevent their technology falling into the hands of the Soviet Union, which had demanded the ships be returned to Japan.

Other mega subs have been found in waters off Oahu and in the Sea of Japan. One in the submarine class remains missing.

The discovery of the I-400 was announced on Monday after NOAA had reviewed its findings with the U.S. State Department and Japanese government officials, researchers said.
