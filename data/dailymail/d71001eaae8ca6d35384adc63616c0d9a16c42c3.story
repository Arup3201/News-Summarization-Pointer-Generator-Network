Internet users say the Russian Postal service's new uniform is far from a first-class look, claiming that it resembles the clothing worn by Nazi SS soldiers.

Images of the uniforms were uploaded to Twitter on Tuesday, with many users drawing comparisons between them and the foreboding outfits that Hitler's feared SS squadron members wore.

Both uniforms appear to share the same dark colouring and angular badges and braiding on the lapel and cuffs.

A Twitter profile called raging.me said the postal uniforms 'sure look familiar to something fascist'.

However, Vadim Nosov, a spokesman for Russian Post, strenuously denied that the uniforms look the same, claiming that internet users had deliberately darkened the photos of the postal uniforms.

According to The Moscow Times, he told the RIA Novosti news agency: 'The uniform of postal management staff is dark blue, [but] office staff wear a lighter colour. The uniforms in the photographs distributed online have simply been retouched to look black.'

He added that the design takes its inspiration from army uniforms that date back to the rule of Peter the Great, the Emperor of Russia between 1721 and 1725.

Last year Russian president Vladimir Putin defended Stalin's deal with Hitler to divide up Poland in 1939 because the Poles did the same thing with the Czech Republic in 1938.

He said it was important that Russian academics were involved in attempts to re-write the history of the 20th century so the impact of the Soviet Union was not forgotten. 

Putin said: 'We had the so-called Munich Agreement in 1938. And what is it? The West hushed it up. 

'Chamberlain arrived, shook his paper and said, 'I brought you peace' when he returned to London after the talks. To which Churchill, I believe, in private, stated, 'Well, now the war is inevitable.' 

'Because appeasement of the aggressor, which Nazi Germany was, would clearly lead to a major future military conflict, and some people understood that. There should be a deep multilateral study of what was happening before World War II.' 

Putin attempted to claim there was a difference between the Munich Agreement and the non-aggression deal between the Soviet Union and Germany. 

He said: 'For example, there are still arguments about the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, and the Soviet Union is blamed for dividing Poland. But what did Poland itself do, when the Germans invaded Czechoslovakia? It took part of Czechoslovakia. It did this itself. And then, in turn, the same thing happened to Poland. 

'I do not want to blame anyone here, but serious studies should show that these were the foreign policy methods at the time. The Soviet Union signed a non-aggression agreement with Germany. They say, 'Oh, how bad.' But what is so bad about it, if the Soviet Union did not want to fight? What is so bad?'  

He also said it was necessary to compare the 25 million victims in the Soviet Union to the combined allied losses.
