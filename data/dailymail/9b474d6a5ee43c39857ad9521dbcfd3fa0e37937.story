Once the grandest ocean liner in the world, RMS Queen Mary is now a luxury Long Beach hotel in California, United States.

And now, as it celebrates the 80th anniversary of its first sail, the history of the great vessel and stories throughout the centuries were on show as the ship opened its doors for a day's free admission.  

The Queen Mary was built by John Brown & Company in Clydebank, Scotland, launched in 1934 on the River Clyde for the Cunard Line, and set on its maiden voyage in 1936 from Southampton to New York.

For the next few years it was used as a luxurious civilian carrier, carrying Hollywood celebrities like Bob Hope and Clark Gable, royalty like the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, and dignitaries like Winston Churchill. 

The Queen Mary was 1,019.5 feet long and weighed 81,237 gross tons. It had a cruising speed of 28.5 knots (about 33 mph). 

Construction began in 1930 in Clydebank, Scotland, and the Queen Mary was destined to stand in a class all her own.

Rumoured the directors of the process, Cunard, had originally decided to call the ship RMS Victoria, however on proposing the name to King George V, Queen Mary was decided upon.

On May 27, 1936, the Queen Mary departed from Southampton, England embarking on her maiden voyage to New York.

She boasted five dining areas and lounges, two cocktail bars and swimming pools, a grand ballroom, a squash court and even a small hospital. 

Was a luxury ocean liner for three years until 1939, when it was transformed into a troopship for the Second World War.

Resumed it's passenger service in 1947, where it continued until 1967, when it docked permanently in California. 

During this time she even set a new speed record, which she held for 14 years. But when the Queen Mary docked in New York in September 1939 that would be the last time she would carry civilian passengers for many years.

Alongside Normandie and Queen Mary's running mate the Queen Elizabeth, the trio were transformed into troopships during the Second World War. 

Known as the 'Grey Ghost' during the War, as she was painted a camouflaged grey color and stripped of her luxurious amenities, the Queen Mary was the largest and fastest troopship to sail, capable of transporting as many as 16,000 troops at 30 knots.

Following the end of World War Two, the Queen Mary underwent a 10-month restoration process to restore her to her previous luxury, and on July 21, 1947, resumed regular passenger service across the Atlantic Ocean, and continued to do so for nearly two more decades.

The ship remained a top ocean liner up until the 1960s when air travel became more popular than sailing, and in 1967 the ageing vessel was retired to Long Beach and turned into a hotel and an events venue.

The ship is home to three world-class restaurants and is an icon in Southern California. 

To celebrate the anniversary, a 15-foot long 600lb cake was made replicating the vessel, with Long Beach mayor Robert Garcia conducting the ceremonial cutting.
