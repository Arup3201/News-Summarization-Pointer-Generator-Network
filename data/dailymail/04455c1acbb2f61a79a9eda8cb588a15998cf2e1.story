As pineapples go, it doesn’t appear to be anything out of the ordinary.

But if you were considering slicing it up to make a fruit salad, you’d be well advised to think twice.

For it has been valued at a purse-busting £10,000 – making it the world’s most expensive piece of fruit. Quite a price for something which has spent most of its life under several tons of horse manure.

Horticulturalists created tropical conditions using small greenhouses heated using a chemical reaction between 30 tonnes of manure, urine, and piles of straw

The pineapple was nurtured over two 
years using traditional Victorian gardening techniques at the Lost 
Gardens of Heligan, the botanical attraction in Cornwall.

Horticulturalists created tropical 
conditions in small greenhouses heated using a chemical reaction between
30 tons of horse manure and urine, and piles of straw.

The gardens have been growing 
pineapples the same way since the 19th century when they used to rent 
them out to wealthy Victorian families as a dinner table decoration.

Eight of the rare pineapples are now developing and botanists say they have cost around £1,200 each to grow.

But one of the pineapples is now 
ready to harvest and the experts say it is worth around £10,000 because 
of its rarity, production values and the unique location – pineapples 
are usually grown in much hotter, foreign climes.

Despite the high value, the freshly 
harvested pineapple won’t be sold but cut and up and fed to garden 
staff.

Spokesman James Stephens said the pineapples were ‘deliciously 
sweet, not stringy, and with an explosive flavour’.

The pineapples are 
grown in a 4ft-deep trench in a 40ft-long ‘pineapple pit’ section of the
botanical gardens. They are developed under 30 tons of manure and are 
regularly soaked in horse urine.

The original gardens of Heligan were 
at their peak during the 19th century. After decades of neglect and a 
devastating hurricane, they were restored in the 1990s.

Pineapples were first brought to 
Europe from Guadeloupe in the Caribbean by Christopher Columbus in 1493.
The word comes from the fruit’s resemblance to a pine cone and is first
recorded in English in the 1660s.

In the 18th century a pineapple cost 
the equivalent of £5,000 today. They became such a symbol of wealth that
the pineapple motif was used to decorate buildings – John Murray, the 
4th Earl of Dunmore, built a 75ft-high stone one atop a pavilion in his 
estate in 1761.

The pineapples are grown in a 4ft-deep trench in a 40ft-long 'pineapple pit',  using traditional Victorian methods; i.e. they are buried under 30 tonnes of manure — and regularly soaked in horse urine.

Pineapples are usually grown in much hotter climes, so horticulturalists created tropical conditions by heating small greenhouses heated using a chemical reaction between 30 tonnes of manure, urine, and piles of straw.
