High-profile rows over climate science have had no lasting impact on people’s views on global warming.

This is according to an analysis of search terms on Google from 2004 to 2013 around two events: 'Climategate' and the discovery of an error about the melting of Himalyan glaciers in a major UN climate report.

In both these incidents, media coverage highlighted apparent issues with the science. 

During 'climategate' emails were hacked from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit in November 2009 (CRU) and used to accuse scientists of misconduct.

Sceptics seized on phrases from the emails such as 'trick...to hide the decline' in data on temperatures to claim scientists manipulated or deleted data to support the evidence of global warming, though they were cleared of doing so following several independent inquiries.

Shortly afterwards, in January 2010, news broke of an error about the rate of ice melt in the Himalayas in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fourth assessment report, a major review of climate science.

Although there were spikes in the search term 'global warming hoax', indicating scepticism, as news of the incidents emerged, levels of the search quickly fell back to previous lows, the study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters found.

The search term 'climategate' halved six days after a peak in public interest, the research found.

The study’s co-author Dr Greg Goldsmith, from the University of Oxford, said: 'The study uses the search term ‘global warming hoax’ as an indicator of global warming scepticism amongst the public.

'Although we found an increase in the volume of searches for the term immediately after the news of the hacking of the emails from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, the search volume quickly returns to the same level as before the incident.

'This suggests no long-term change in the level of climate change scepticism.'

The research also found that 'global warming' was more commonly searched for than 'climate change', although the gap between the two had narrowed.

But the analysis suggested an overall fall in interest in the subject since a peak in 2007 after Al Gore’s climate documentary 'An Inconvenient Truth' was released and the IPCC’s fourth assessment report was published.

Dr William Anderegg, from Princeton University, said: 'Our results showed that the volume of these search terms peaked in 2007 around a unique sequence of major events - the releases of Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth in August 2006 and the IPCC fourth assessment report in April 2007 - and the level of interest has declined since then.

'There is no single reason why the public have become less interested in climate change. However research certainly suggests that economic issues, such as the recent recession, tend to take precedence over environmental issues like climate change.'

Although there were spikes in the search term 'global warming hoax' after both events, indicating scepticism, levels of the search quickly fell back to previous lows

A scientific study which suggests global warming has been exaggerated was rejected by a respected journal because it might fuel climate scepticism, it was claimed last week.

The alarming intervention, which raises fears of ‘McCarthyist’ pressure for environmental scientists to conform, came after a reviewer said the research was ‘less than helpful’ to the climate cause.

Professor Lennart Bengtsson, a research fellow at the University of Reading and one of five authors of the study, said he suspected that intolerance of dissenting views on climate science was preventing his paper from being published.

‘The problem we now have in the climate community is that some scientists are mixing up their scientific role with that of a climate activist,’ he told the Times.

Prof Bengtsson’s paper suggests that the Earth’s environment might be much less sensitive to greenhouse gases than previously thought.

If he and his four co-authors are correct, it would mean that carbon dioxide and other pollutants are having a far less severe impact on climate than green activists would have us believe.

The research, if made public, would be a huge challenge to the finding of the UN’s Intergovernmental panel on Climate Change (IPCC), that the global average temperature would rise by up to 4.5C if greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were allowed to double.

The paper suggested that the climate might be less sensitive to greenhouse gases than had been claimed by the IPCC in its report last September, and recommended that more work be carried out ‘to reduce the underlying uncertainty’.
