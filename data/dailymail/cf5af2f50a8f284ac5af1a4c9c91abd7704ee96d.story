Vince Wilfork's 11-year spell as a New England Patriot looks to be over after the franchise informed the defensive tackle they will not be picking up the option on his contract.

Due a $4million roster bonus on Tuesday, the move was widely expected, but nevertheless drew an emotional statement on the popular defensive tackle's Twitter feed.

'I'm in a good place, he wrote. 'I have a great relationship with the Patriots organization. Please know how blessed my family and I have been to be able to play 11 years in New England for an amazing organization,' said Wilfork, who bookended his time at Foxborough with two Super Bowl wins.

'I will take my time, think things through, take into consideration many things, but mainly family and see where life goes from there,'

'But regardless remember I will always remain a New Englander a Patriot forever,' he added.

After signing a three-year, $22.5m deal last year, Wilfork played 766 snaps last season, and he hinted that he will continue playing as there is 'lots of gas still left in the tank'.

The move gives the Patriots $8.06m in cap space, but the parties could yet reach a new, reduced, agreement for Wilfork to remain in New England.
