Wealthy pensioners should be stripped of their winter fuel allowance to fund cheaper bus fares for young people, a Liberal Democrat Minister claimed yesterday.

Business Minister Jo Swinson said subsidising rich pensioners’ energy bills with payments of up to £300 each was hard to justify in times of austerity.

She said the cash should be used instead to help young people get to work or college with discounted bus tickets.

Ms Swinson added that the plan was likely to be included in the Lib Dems’ Election manifesto.

Speaking at her party’s Scottish conference, she said the Lib Dems were suggesting that the winter fuel allowance ‘should not be going to all pensioners and all wealthy pensioners.

‘That is something which is very difficult to justify when there are so many other difficult decisions being made.’

The plan would be to give ‘two-thirds discount to young people in terms of bus travel, and to pay for that partly by the winter fuel payments actually being taken away from wealthy pensioners who can afford it,’ Ms Swinson said.

Instead she suggests cutting the payments and using the spare cash to help young people get to college or work with a two-thirds discount on bus fares (file image)
