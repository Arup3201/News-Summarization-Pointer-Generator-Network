An escaped bull was shot dead by a sheriff's deputy after sending one man to the hospital with bruised ribs during its hours on the loose.

The beast was one of seven bulls that escaped from  its pasture near Cornelius, a town west of Portland, Oregon, on Sunday night. 

Six were recaptured by farmers the same day, but one bull remained at large and passed through residential areas Monday afternoon, The Oregonian reported.

The bull was loose from Sunday night through 2pm Monday, when it was shot by a sheriff's deputy in the field above

The bull was loose from Sunday night until it was killed by sheriff's deputy Michael Alexander at 2.19pm

The 800-pound animal had already been shot multiple times by local butchers and was visibly bleeding before it locked eyes with Morgan White while passing through his cul-de-sac around 2pm.

'I decided I'm going to make a run for it, which is probably my worst decision,' Mr White told KPTV.

The bull charged the 23-year-old man, who had been outside smoking, as he attempted to flee, knocking him down and bruising his ribs.

Morgan White, 23, was smoking outside his home when he saw the bull come into his cul-de-sac and locked eyes with the animal

"I didn't hit my head. I didn't pass out, but everything kind of went black for a second," he said. 

Mr White, who compared the incident to being hit by a freight train, was taken to a hospital in Portland and released Monday evening.

He said he was lucky that he wasn't trampled and his injuries weren't worse. 

The bull's owners, who remain unidentified, had called local butchers Jacobsmuhlen's Meats to dispatch the animal, which had partially sawed-off horns, after it didn't return to its farm.

However two shots fired by the butchers were 'not effective at all' according to the Washington County sheriff's office.

Sgt. Michael Alexander eventually shot the bull dead at 2.19pm after it crossed Tualatin Valley Highway, where traffic had been stopped, and stopped in a field about a quarter mile from Mr White's home.

Employees from Jacobsmuhlen's Meats went into the field to retrieve the bull after it was downed.

The bull broke free after flooding damaged the fence that kept it at its farm and the sheriff's office said that the owners would not receive a citation because a weather-related incident caused the escape.

One of the six other bulls wandered into nearby Hillsboro on Sunday, but was captured by its owners.
