As Cara Delevingne celebrated the launch of her latest collection for luxury label Mulberry, FEMAIL headed into the depths of the English countryside for a quintessentially British picnic with the world's most famous supermodel. And breathe. 

Set in the idyllic Cornbury Park in Oxfordshire, in an exclusive walled garden behind the scenes, around one hundred fashionistas from all over the world flew in to share a cuppa and slice of cake with Cara.

Cara oozed festival chic wearing loose PJ-style patterned trousers and a cream shell top by the brand, but added her own twist (of course) with novelty specs and white and gold Mulberry hi-tops (one for the Christmas wish list then).

Greeted by lots of friends including the uber-cool Douglas Booth, Gemma Chan, Bonnie Wright, Jaime Winstone, Gala Gordon, Tanya Burr and Chloe Delevingne, Cara mingled her way through Lord and Lady Rotherwick’s beautiful Cornbury estate. 

Cara’s good friend Will Heard, with whom she duetted on Sonnentanz, performed an acoustic set, and DJ Benson hit the decks for the evening event.

Lunch is served: Young British Foodie chef Giles Clark prepared picnic hampers filled with enticing treats based on English ingredients

Delectable! Giles Clark prepared a selection of tea-time treats, including roasted cobnuts, sandwiches with dressed crab, and pressed cucumber juice flavoured with honey

Free-flowing Laurent Perrier champagne served in vintage crystal glasses helped get the party started and young British Foodie chef Giles Clark prepared picnic hampers filled with enticing treats based on English ingredients.

Fashionistas nibbled on roasted cobnuts, sandwiches with dressed crab, cream and gooseberry jelly biscuits and pressed cucumber juice flavoured with honey. 

Guests were queuing to get their hands on the picnic baskets as a keepsake (a few were spotted sneaking the Mulberry checked rugs that were scattered around the hay bales into their bags, too!). 

Aside from the foodie treats, the highlight of the event was undoubtedly the ‘Mulberry Loves Craft’ tent.

Look who it is! Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley, the famous healthy chefs, also put in an appearance

Golden girl: Heart-shaped Mulberry balloons were created in Cara's honour and the main tent was furnished to look like a Mulberry kitchen

It was booked solid from the beginning and had massive queues everyday with all the most stylish festie girls clamouring to get the armband, which could be customised and monogrammed  from a choice of Mulberry colours.

Furnished to look like a Mulberry kitchen, the cosy tent was designed with a nod to the brand’s founder Roger Saul, who started making the very first Mulberry pieces around his family’s kitchen table. 

Cara then headed off for a night of revelry with her showbiz pals - and two Mulberry bags in tow.

It's the Cara-Van! Guests posed by Cara's Landrover, which had been given a stylish makeover for the day

The golden ticket: FEMAIL hit Wilderness festival via Claridges to toast Cara Delevingne's new handbag collection with Mulberry
