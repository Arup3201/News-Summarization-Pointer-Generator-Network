Cho Hyun-ah, an executive VP at Korean Air Lines and the chairman's eldest daughter, has resigned after causing an on board fracas over nuts

A top executive of Korean Air Lines resigned on Tuesday amid mounting public criticism that she delayed a plane over how she was served macadamia nuts.

Company officials said that Chairman Cho Yang-ho has accepted the resignation of Cho Hyun-ah, his eldest daughter and an executive vice president.

The junior Cho came under public fire following revelations that a recent Korean Air Lines flight from New York to South Korea returned to the gate because she ordered a senior crew member off the plane. 

Cho was angered that she was served bagged macadamia nuts instead of nuts on a plate. 

The airline had apologized for inconveniencing passengers. But it also said it was 'natural' for Cho to fault crew's ignorance of procedures.

Flight KE086’s to Incheon Airport, close to Seoul, was delayed by 11 minutes due to the incident. 

Ms Cho, who is also known by her English name Heather, was also reportedly facing up to ten years in prison over the fracas. 

South Korea's Transport Ministry announced on Monday that they are investigating if Cho violated the Aviation Safety Law, which states that passengers should not cause disturbances, including using violent language or yelling, for safety reasons.

Flight 86 was already on the runway for its 12.50am departure from JFK when Ms Cho lost her temper after an unidentified worker placed some macadamia nuts in front of her as she sat in first class, reports the Korean Times.

The junior flight attendant's faux pas was to serve the nuts inside the bag that they came in rather than presenting them on a small dish - as is protocol.

 Ms Cho screamed at the attendant and told him to bring out the company's in-flight service manual so he could read the proper nut-handling guidelines.

When he failed to find it, Cho lost her cool and ordered him off the flight.

'The chief flight attendant failed to get the right manual, and this led Cho to believe he was not qualified for that job,' a Korean Air official told the Korean Times.

Without giving the 250 passengers on board a warning, the pilots decided to give in to her demands and return to the airport to drop off the attendant.  

As their investigation gets underway, the Transport Ministry must try to figure out if Cho's behavior warrants a prison sentence.

'We'll see whether her behavior was against the law,' a ministry official told the Korean Times. 'It is an unprecedented case, so we need to see the related regulations.'

'Even though she is senior vice president at the company, she was a passenger at that time, so she had to behave and be treated as a passenger,' they added. 

'She could have taken other measures after coming back to Korea, such as strengthening service training.'
