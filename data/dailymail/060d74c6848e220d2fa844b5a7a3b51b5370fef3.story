These photographs may look like they have been duplicated, but together they give a rare and extraordinary 3D view of the First World War.

The rare pictures are among the few in existence showing the devastating battles and the appalling conditions soldiers suffered between 1914 and 1918 in this way.

They do not work with the naked eye and require a stereoscope, an early form of 3D glasses, which 
forces a viewer's eyes to cross and make the two pictures converge and 
appear three dimensional.

Going over the top: These soldiers find themselves in the firing line at Passchendaele as Allied soldiers fight the Germans on the Western Front

Eye-popping: This is a rare 3D picture of the famous Disaster on the Dunes as German troops blow up a bridge isolating allied battalions during the First World War. Separately they are 2D but viewed through a stereoscope they become 3D

Eerie: A soldier inspects the ruins of the destroyed cathedral at Richbourg on France's border with Belgium

The key: All the images require a stereoscope - which makes the eyes cross and the two images will then diverge into one to create a 3D photograph

The historic collection of 100 3D photos were taken along the Western Front, including at the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Arras, and Ypres.

Away from the front line there are also images of the Prince of Wales, Army commanders discussing plans of attack as well as buildings and streets devastated by fighting.

But there is also a twist, because although most are genuine battlefield shots, others were produced as propaganda to show the war was going well.

Experts say some claiming to be from the first battle of Ypres, are 
thought to have actually been taken on a training ground in Britain.

The collection is being sold at auction 
tomorrow in Cirencester.

Trench life: Seaforths soldiers sit in trenches while under fire from snipers, with their mascot at the feet

Getting some rest: Soldiers are described as resting on a road near Menin in Belgium, after weeks of fighting at Ypres

Drink: Seaforth Highlanders, one of Scotland's most historic regiments, stop for water from a town centre pump

Health care at war: Royal Army Medical Corps at Monchy dressing station attend to wounded coming down the line during the conflict that started 100 years ago

Leaders: Sir John French, Commander in Chief in France, stands with other commanders in the garden of his headquarters

Royalty: The Prince of Wales, who would one day be King, briefly, in the garden of the chateau which was his HQ in France during the conflict

Chris Albury, an auctioneer who specialises in historical documents, said: 'It's not often you find 100 images like these together in a complete collection.

'What is quite interesting is that there are some that appear to be actual battle field images which were actually photographed on a training ground because there are no bodies with wounds or any evidence of artillery present.

'No individual with a stereo camera would have been so close to an assault where the enemy was climbing over the sandbags.

'It's actually evidence of the First World War media spin, which is quite fun really.'

The auctioneer at Dominic Winters in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, added: 'Looking through a Stero-viewer at the images would have been quite sensational at the time because you couldn't have felt much closer to the action while being in the safety of your own drawing room.'

The pictures, which form the complete first volume of a Realistic Travels' history of the Great War, are believed to be part of a larger set designed for a stereoscope.

Five further volumes were produced and a complete series contains 600 stereoviews.

Although showing the same image left and right when layered on top of each other underneath the scope, they form a unique three-dimensional view.

The set of images, which Mr Albury believes are among the best he had seen from the period, are expected to sell for between £150 to £200 when they go under the hammer today

They look like duplicates, but using a stereoscope the photos merge to create a stunning 3D image

But others may have been set-up in Britain to spread positive propaganda across country about life in trenches
