Ann Romney and Michelle Obama politely sat and watched as their husbands battled it out during the third and final presidential debate on Monday night.

And in keeping with tradition, the First Lady and her potential successor took to the stage and greeted the men and their respective families once the harsh words stopped flying.

But it was Ann Romney who showed the full extent of her support for her husband as she grabbed him from behind as he nearly lost his balance while shaking hands with supporters.

Having a blast: Ann Romney gets in on the action by helping Mitt

Seeing the fun in it: The supportive wife seemed to be enjoying herself

She gamefully held Mitt back by the waist as he bent over and was reaching out to the crowd below him.

Rather than be put off by her truly supportive role, Ann relished the chance to help.

Because of their swift movements, and the joyful expression on her face, it almost appears that the two are in the midst of doing the hokey pokey dance (known to British revellers as the hokey cokey).

The 'dance' of the Romneys came after 
their extended family met with Mr and Mrs Obama onstage, and there was 
another interaction that stole the show.

A tight grip: During the actual debate, Ann and the rest of the audience was tame and quiet

President Obama showed his more tender side and stooped down to shake hands with one of Romney's grandchildren- Miles, 4- as the families converged onstage.

The Romneys looked on adoringly as Miles shared an adorable meet and greet with the president.

Earlier, the candidates' wives took 
their seats for the debate tonight, each sitting stoically minutes 
before the final showdown.

Michelle
Obama donned a grey Thom Browne dress adorned with black lace while Ann
Romney wore a green Oscar De La Renta frock with a floral-print skirt.

Quality time: The families share a moment as the debate concludes

The women did not interact before the debate began.

But
after it was over, the two families met on stage visibly relieved that 
the ordeal of the TV debates was over in scenes more reminiscent of a 
backyard barbeque.

Mrs Obama and Mrs Romney took 
different approaches as their husbands prepared for the 
question-and-answer session moderated by longtime CBS newsman Bob 
Schieffer.

The first lady arrived in Florida today 
and immediately hit the campaign trail for her husband, speaking at an 
event at Broward College hours before the third and final debate.

Over
the weekend, Mrs Romney took advantage of the Florida sunshine in her 
fetching floral suit, going for a swim with her family at a public 
beach.

Ann Romney, who has been in Florida since Saturday, took advantage of the sun and surf, splashing around in the water with her son Craig, his wife Mary and grandchildren, before she grabbed a towel and headed for a sun lounger surrounded by other families.

At last week's debate at Hofstra University on Long Island, the wives wore matching hot pink dresses.

with matching cropped jacket by Michael Kors, while Mrs Romney wore a 
shift with capped sleeves in exactly the same Pepto Bismol-like hue.Â 

It was later revealed that the color scheme was in honor of breast cancer awareness month.

Mrs Romney has herself battled breast
cancer and also spoke this weekend about her struggle with M.S., when 
she visited a Cuban restaurant in Florida.

Romney
was diagnosed in 1998 with the incurable neurological disease, which 
attacks the central nervous system and immobilizes many of its victims.

Mrs
Romney said she was an avid tennis player when she first started 
noticing her symptoms, which primarily affected her balance and 
coordination.

'It was really tough on my balance,' she said. 'I couldn't figure out what was going on.

'That was sort of what was happening. I was trying to figure out what was going on, what was wrong with me.'
