Three children were rescued from a burning car in Pennsylvania after their mother left them alone in the vehicle while she went shopping inside a Walmart.

Stacey Nelson, 32, is facing charges after she admitted to police that she left her three kids unsupervised to shop for 'about five minutes'.

Police said it is extremely lucky that the children, aged two, three and ten escaped unhurt from the blaze on Friday afternoon.

According to the Bradford Era, the source of the fire was traced to the passenger seat of the car where the ten-year-old girl had been sitting, while her younger siblings were strapped into their car seats in the back.

Police said the girl told them she had been playing with a yellow lighter that she had found in the glove compartment and had 'caught some papers on fire and tried to get it out, but it was too late'.

Foster Township Police Chief Tom Munn said passers-by in the parking lot rescued the children from the unlocked SUV. Ms Nelson was found inside the store.

Firefighters extinguished the fire and the car, which had suffered heavy damage to the interior, was towed from the scene.
