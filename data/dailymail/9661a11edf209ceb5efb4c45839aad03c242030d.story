A space-age chain-mail structure stands 
tall in Raval, Barcelona's rough-and-ready arts quarter.

The statuesque Hotel Barcelo 
Raval makes its own mark on a city skyline which boasts the Sagrada Familia, the Villa Olímpica Towers, the Arts Hotel and the Tibidabo mountain with its faded carousels.

It opened in September 2008, taking up a site 
on La Rambla del Raval that was once a housing estate. Fast forward six years, and this ultra-modern four-star retreat attracts a cool crowd in what is increasingly the alternative centre of the city.

Striking: Interior designer Jordi Gali was the man responsible for creating the hotel's chic B-Lounge area

Renowned interior designer Jordi Galí was the man responsible for creating an interior so flash that - the receptionist says - people often wonder if they have walked into a nightclub.

So it is fitting that, in the summer, when the city's music festivals Sonar and Primavera come to town, this is where all the DJs want to stay.

But don't let that put you off.

This is not one of those image-obsessed hotels where the dolled-up flaunt their money and their flesh (although you might gain that impression if the glamourous rooftop pool is your first port of call).

The vibe is relaxed. Everyone fits in, and staff treat every guest with grace.

Modern comforts: The 182 rooms have iphone docking stations, nespresso coffee makers and fabulous views

The B-Lounge - the dramatic pink and purple reception which you encounter as you walk into the hotel - is a multifunctional space, cafe by day; cocktail and tapas bar by night.

The tapas, incidentally, is glorious stuff - the very idea of small sharing plates taken to dizzy heights by beautifully sculpted (and tasty) patatas bravas and manchego lollipops.

Meanwhile, inside the rooms, it is all about ergonomics.

Things are so touchable. Each of the 182 rooms is like a futuristic pod, with iPhone docking stations, motorised curtains, Nespresso cofffee makers and enormous fluffy beds.

A flair for design: Rooms at the hotel look as good on the inside as the view is impressive on the outside 

The rooms have large, wide windows, sound-proofed doors and what the hotel calls an 'integrated bathroom' - which, simply put, means it is best if you are travelling with someone you know well.

A glass panel in the shower pod leaves very little to the imagination - as my partner found out the hard way, when room service arrived unexpectedly.

When you leave the hotel, you have a decision to make.

One direction takes you towards a host of cafes, bars and galleries; the other leads to the 
city's red light district. Unless you are interested in that kind of 'entertainment', it is advisable to double check with the hotel staff about the best way to go.

Find the right path, and you will be spoiled for choice. The Raval area is at the heart of the city, five minutes 
from the Barrio Gotico - where boutique shops tempt on every street. The hotel is also a short distance from the Ramblas - Barcelona's (rather tacky) main avenue - as well as the Plaza de Catalunya and Liceu metro stations, which provide access to the rest of the metropolis.

The surrounding streets bulge with achingly cool bookshops and trinket stores. And the nearby Monroe cafe serves up delicious gazpacho in a hip post-industrial setting.

The main attraction is the 360-degree view from the hotel's terrace bar - best accompanied by a cocktail or a glass of cava. The uninhibited can also fling off their outerwear for a splash in the pool.

It is perhaps worth noting that, while anyone is welcome at Barcelo Raval, it is not a place for the aurally sensitive. The night air is hung with neighbourhood noises of all varieties, from revellers making merry to dogs yapping and horns beeping.

But if you have been partying yourself, you will find, once your head hits pillow, that you don't notice.

Double rooms at the Hotel Barcelo Raval (Rambla del Raval 17-21; 0034 9 3320 1490; www.barceloraval.com) start at €110 (£92) per room per night.

Prices based on two people sharing, on a bed-and-breakfast basis.
