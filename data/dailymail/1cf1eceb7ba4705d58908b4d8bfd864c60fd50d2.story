This has been the most exciting Premier League season for many years, with no shortage of quality every week. Here's where my honours go…

1. Top player: Luis Suarez 

He has won the PFA and FWA awards and both were thoroughly deserved. I hope he gets a goal against Newcastle to set a scoring record for a 38-game season, because a talent like him should be in the history books.

Star man: Luis Suarez has been in electrifying form for Liverpool this season, netting 31 Premier League goals

2. Top goal: Pajtim Kasami (Crystal Palace v FULHAM)

I was in the Sky studios for Monday Night Football when Kasami unleashed that extraordinary volley on the run after controlling a long ball on his chest. The goal was greeted with spontaneous applause.

3. Top save: David Marshall (CARDIFF v Aston Villa)

I had no hesitation in picking Marshall for my team of the year. He's made some brilliant stops this season, none better than the one when he flung himself from a seemingly impossible situation to deny Andreas Weimann.

No way through: Marshall, pictured making a save against Sunderland, could not stop Cardiff being relegated back to the Championship

4. Top game: Liverpool 3-2 Manchester City

As advertisements for the English game go, you couldn’t wish to see a better one. Two top clubs went flat out to win. Liverpool’s start was breathtaking, City’s response was outstanding and it was settled by a brilliant goal from Philippe Coutinho.

5. Unsung hero: Manuel Pellegrini

I was critical of Pellegrini in the early stages of his reign but he deserves credit for being on the verge of marking his first season in England with two trophies. Manchester City’s success has not just been down to the players.
