Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his column for MailOnline Sport. The Barnet boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football and this week reflects on what might have been after he thought he had landed the England job and Liverpool's maverick forward Mario Balotelli.

I THOUGHT MY ENGLAND CALL HAD ARRIVED

My old chairman at Brentford was that former top BBC boss, Greg Dyke.

He was always nice to me and looked after me well and just let me get on with managing the team without any interference or any comment whether we won, lost or drew.

All he ever said was, 'If you have a problem or you want a chat, give me a call.'

Greg Dyke, Allen's old chairman at Brentford, gave Allen the impression he had the England job

Can you believe that at quarter-past 10 the other night, just before dropping into the land of sweet dreams, I looked at my phone, which had been on silent all evening, and I noticed a missed call from Greg Dyke.

As we all know, he is now the chairman of the Football Association and chooses the England manager.

With more wins than any other manager in the country this season – more than Jose Mourinho, Manuel Pellegrini and Arsene Wenger – I thought the time had come for Mad Dog to step up to manage the Three Lions.

I never slept the whole night, working out where I was going to play Wayne and which health spa to send Raheem to rejuvenate his tired legs.

Sadly, he never called back again and I found myself the next day managing Barnet away at Chelmsford, in the FA Cup fourth-round qualifying.

The dream goes on.

IT'S TOP DOG NOW - BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING

It's been an unbelievable, incredible start to the season for all the players, the staff and supporters at Barnet football club. We are flying at the top of the Conference table.

But I remember, when I was an 11-year-old boy, a long-distance runner called Brendan Foster, in the 1976 Montreal Olympic 10,000metre final.

Halfway through, he was about a lap ahead, and looked untouchable. He was striding to glory in his white vest with red and blue coloured band.

Jumping up and down on the settee, in our old-fashioned front room, I could not believe my eyes as he faded and drifted and anxiously looked over his shoulder.

The other runners closed in, got close to him and gradually he faded away and had to settle for a bronze medal.

That is the example I used with my Barnet players about the season ahead.

We made a pledge at Barnet to train harder, improve our concentration, time-keeping, discipline, smartness, conduct and behaviour.

There is still a long way to go this season and no time and no room to look over our shoulder and start fading.

HOP, SKIPPING AND JUMPING AT QPR

I had the pleasure of being a special guest at my old club Queens Park Rangers for their Sunday afternoon game against Liverpool a couple of weeks ago.

It was weird sitting in the Loftus Road stand, on the aisle where George Graham, our old youth team manager, used to make us run, hop, jump and sprint up and down every step.

I was a 16-year-old who had just left school and George was fiercely demanding and his desire to improve all the young players physically and mentally would be frowned upon nowadays.

But without that blood, sweat and tears, there is no way I would've had a career as an average footballer.

Midfield general Allen played over 100 times for QPR between 1984 and 1989

ALLEN'S ANALYSIS 

THE PLAYER I KEEP HEARING ABOUT... ALEX McCARTHY

This goalkeeper is one to watch.

I had the absolute pleasure of playing in a QPR team with the most laid-back, confident, calm goalkeeper.

He never panicked or got stressed out. He oozed confidence, with his shoulders back, his head held high and a rascal of a dodgy moustache.

His name was David Seaman.

Alex McCarthy, seen here in action against Liverpool, is highly-rated by Mad Dog

His Friday nights weren't spent at home eating spaghetti and fresh fruit salad. He spent his pre-game nights perched at the side of a river carp fishing and sleeping in a little tent.

Seaman was an amazing character.

Having watched McCarthy play, Harry Redknapp has done well to pick him up for only £7m. 

With his stature, ability to come for crosses, strong body language, I think very soon he will be challenging Joe Hart for England's No 1 jersey and go on to achieve what Seaman did. He is top quality and top class.

ONE THING I'D CHANGE ABOUT... FOOTBALL AGENTS' REPUTATIONS

All these football agents tend to have a bad reputation with most supporters.

But they are vital in getting players in and out of clubs both to cut the wage bill and to try to improve your team.

Gareth Bale's agent David Manasseh is one of the most successful and wealthy agents there is.

During my useless spell as manager of Cheltenham Town, he was doing a deal to take Peter Crouch from Liverpool to Portsmouth for £9m back in 2008.

But in between negotiating the deal at Anfield, he was texting me about a young midfielder available on a free transfer called Ian Westlake.

I've got a lot of respect for someone who will still remember their client going on a free transfer when they're doing a deal worth millions.

He called me recently about an 18-year-old centre forward, who is going to be a golden nugget for us.

 THE BIG ISSUE... MARIO BALOTELLI

I saw Mario Balotelli play for Manchester City at West Ham a couple of year ago and Roberto Mancini substituted him 10 minutes after half-time.

He never broke sweat and looked uninterested, fed up, and constantly waved his hands at his team-mates in disgust at their passes and their efforts.

Mancini hooked him and the few thousand City fans behind the goal all clapped him with energy and enthusiasm.

Balotelli has struggled to make an impact at Liverpool since joining from AC Milan in the summer

But he walked from the pitch, sulking, looking at the ground, and never once acknowledged the supporters who had paid their hard-earned cash to travel to London and buy a ticket to watch their heroes play.

Brendan Rodgers has got a tough task to transform Balotelli.

There is no denying he can win you a game, but without a doubt a player like that will not win you the league.
