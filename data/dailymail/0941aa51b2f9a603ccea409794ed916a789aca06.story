Police have defended their decision to use Facebook to notify a mother that her 30-year-old son had died after being hit by a car.

Frantic Anna Lamb-Creasey - who did not see the message from police until a month later - had spent weeks searching for her son Rickie Lamb, who went missing in Atlanta, U.S., in January.

Now a detective from the Clayton County Police Department has said 'several traditional attempts' were made to contact Mr Lamb's family, adding: 'Society has accepted social media as a major form of communication, and so have I'.

Devastation: Anna Lamb-Creasey was infuriated after police used Facebook to notify her of her 30-year-old son's death

Search: Rickie Lamb's mother had been calling hospitals for weeks after her son (pictured) went missing

The message to Mr Lamb's mother was sent from a Facebook account under the name of Misty Hancock, which had an image of rapper T.I. as the profile picture.

Because it was not from one of Ms Lamb-Creasey's Facebook 'friends', it did not appear in her regular inbox, and when she eventually did see it weeks later, the strange name and profile picture led her to assume it was fake.

As the family grew increasingly desperate, Ms Lamb-Creasey's daughter finally called the number listed on the strange message and was connected to an officer who delivered the news of Mr Lamb's death.

'We make every possible attempt to apply best practices when handling these sensitive matters,' the police statement said, according to Digitallife.today.com.

The statement prepared by a Clayton County Detective said the force was introducing an official Facebook page to prevent similar incidents in the future.

'This site will serve as another format to relay current events and 
notifications to the community that we serve,' it said.

'We 
will continue the traditional methods of personal face to face contact 
as we integrate this new tool of social media.'

The force is also conducting a 'thorough review' of the way Rickie Lamb's family were notified of his death.

Strange: The Facebook message about her son's death came from someone named 'Misty Hancock' whose profile picture featured Atlanta rapper T.I.

Review: Clayton County Police Department said it was looking into why Misty Hancock's profile was used to deliver the message

Mr Lamb died after being hit by a car on
the night of January 24. His mother did not learn of his death until 
February 14, when her daughter opened the message sent from Misty 
Hancock on January 31.

It read: 'Anna, This is Lt Schindler with the 
Clayton County Police Dept.,' the message read. 'It is important that I 
speak with you immediately. Call me at 678-***-****. Thanks so much.'

Her daughter called the number and was connected to the police, who informed her that Rickie Lamb had died when a driver hit him as he crossed Tara Boulevard and Old Dixie Road on January 24 around 11 p.m., not far from his mother's home. 

Ms Lamb-Creasey said she was furious that her son's body had been sitting in a morgue for nearly a month while police failed to get in touch with her. 

'They told me that they did the best that they can do,' Lamb-Creasey said at the time. 'But I'm not sure about that. (Because) if they can track a criminal down, they couldn't track me down? They could have done better.

'I've been on my job 13 years,' she said through tears. 'They could have found me.'

Grief: Ms Lamb-Creasey said she was furious her son's body was left lying in a morgue for weeks

Anger: Mr Lamb's girlfriend also told of her anger at the police department's methods of contacting the family

Clayton County police said they made every effort to contact the family by phone. They said they called the home phones at several addresses and never could reach anyone.

The force said it was looking into why Misty Hancock's Facebook account was used to relay the message.

Griefstricken Ms Lamb-Creasey said getting in touch via an official police department Facebook page was the least officers could have done.

Mr Lamb's girlfriend also told of her anger at the police department's means of contacting his loved ones.

'People need to know that it's a police department trying to contact them,' said Melissa Wilson. 'If you just have a picture of a rapper T.I. no one's gonna take that serious.'
