A picturesque coastal village in Cumbria was today named the best place in Britain to raise a family.

St Bees - which has a population of just 1,800 and an average house price of £139,000 - is known for its low crime rate, thriving community spirit and unique local traditions, according to a study.

These include an annual charity pram race and vintage tractor procession, while the village is also known for its good exam results and being where actor Rowan Atkinson attended school.

James Davies, the headteacher of St Bees School, where Atkinson attended, told the Daily Mirror: ‘St Bees offers a safe yet stimulating environment in which parents and children can grow together – taking advantage of the breathtaking beach and wonderful surrounding countryside.

‘It is as familiar as it is familial, as everyone is known. The village is an ideal place for families. It is a small, very safe area that is enriched by a diverse and extremely supportive community.’
