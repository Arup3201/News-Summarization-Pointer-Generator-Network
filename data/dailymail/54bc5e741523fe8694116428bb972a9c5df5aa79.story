They're the dinosaurs that wowed cinema audiences in Steven Spielberg's 1993 film classic Jurassic Park - and now you could own them.

Ten full-sized dinosaur models used in the block buster are tipped to sell for £100,000.

The models include the huge head of the Tyrannosaurus Rex that wreaked havoc on the theme park of cloned dinosaurs and ate other monsters and humans alike.

His company Dino Don Inc has cast the 10 dinosaurs for touring museum exhibitions and they are now selling the models at US auctioneers Profiles in History.

Joe Maddalena, of Profiles in History, said: 'These dinosaurs are an embodiment of creativity and talent and are being offered to the public for the very first time.

Tense: The scene where the Velociraptors hunted the children in a kitchen is one of the most memorable

'The Triceratops head is one of the most memorable dinosaurs seen in the first Jurassic Park movie.

'Audiences were in as much astonishment as the characters when they encountered her for the first time, laying ill but breathing deeply. This scene captured audiences and set the tone for the unexpected.'

Other Jurassic Park dinosaurs up for auction include a dome-headed Pachycephalosaurus, a baby Tyrannosaurus Rex, a baby Stegosaur and T. rex, and the head and neck of the giant Brachiosaurus.

They are being sold on October 17.
