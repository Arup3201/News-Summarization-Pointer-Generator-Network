Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has revealed that he currently has no interest in signing players in January, despite the club's poor form.

Last season's Premier League runners-up spent £113million in the summer but many of the new players have failed to settle. And Rodgers believes the focus should be on recreating the spirit of last season, rather further squad additions.

'It (buying new players) is not something I am looking at,' the 41-year-old said. 'After the weekend, the focus was not to dwell on that. We have to learn from that and try and get a result here.

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has revealed that he has no interest in signing players in January

'I just need to get us back to a level of confidence that allows you to perform. Losing can be the making of you. You learn from it. That is what we are aiming to do.'

Rodgers' side was characterised last season by the intensity of their play, but that seems to have disappeared, and the former Swansea boss is intent on regaining that confidence. 

'When you don’t have so much coaching time, it is mostly psychological what you are trying to achieve.  If we focus on that too much there is no way we could play to our level.

Rodgers said he had a good relationship with the club's owners and they had been very supportive of him

'We need to make sure the training ground is a happy place to be. We have lost more than we would have liked. But the next game is an opportunity. You try to affect the players in a positive way. 

'Sometimes it just takes a game, an action to change a season for you. We have to believe that can happen. We haven’t been anywhere near our levels. But you can never give up. 

'We have to believe that the honesty of the group will get us the results and that is what we will keep working towards.'

There had been suggestions that the relationship between Rodgers and the club's American ownership has been tested by the side's recent poor form. Rodgers, though, refuted such claims.

He said: 'I haven’t spoken to them as of yet. I have had a few messages. But they have always been supportive of me. 

'They were a big reason why I came here. My focus is just on getting Liverpool to win games and I know that is what will make them most happy.'

Liverpool face Bulgarian side Ludogorets on Wednesday and Rodgers claimed there was no complacency in his side ahead of the clash.

'This is the same as any of the others,' he said. 'We give Ludo a great respect. They have surprised a lot of people. They are technically a very good side. We just decided to stay at home. It gave the players a chance to recover.'
