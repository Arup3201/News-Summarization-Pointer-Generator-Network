It seemed that the Queen has been taking inspiration from this season's catwalks with her on-trend pink pastel outfit today.

The 87-year-old joined her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh on a visit to Lloyd's of London.

Prince Philip joked about whether the Royal Collection is insured for damage by mice and asked about financial cover for the priceless paintings, furniture, silverware and ceramics which make up the collection amassed by sovereigns over the centuries.

It is held in trust by the Queen for her
 successors and the nation, and works include historic paintings by 
artists like Vermeer and Rembrandt as well as contemporary pieces by 
Tracey Emin and Lucian Freud.

Paul Lawrence, chief underwriting officer with the global specialist insurance group Hiscox, said after speaking to the Duke: 'I mentioned Hiscox insuring the Royal Collection and he asked if damage by mice was covered, and I said for him I'm sure everything is covered.

The Queen and Duke were visiting Lloyd's of London to mark the specialist insurance market's 325th anniversary, celebrated last year.

The famous Lutine Bell was rung twice - a signal of good news - to mark the monarch's arrival.

The last time it was sounded to honour a royal event was the birth of Prince George last summer.

Lloyd's grew out of Edward Lloyd's 17th century coffee house in London which was an important meeting place for ship owners, captains and merchants and became the place to obtain marine insurance.

Lloyd's has expanded from marine insurance and today provides cover for specialist risks such as cyber, space, aviation and energy insurance for brokers and customers around the world.
