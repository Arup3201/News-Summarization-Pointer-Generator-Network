It was back to business for the future king and queen of Spain today as they made their first public appearance since King Juan Carlos announced his plans to abdicate.

Crown Prince Felipe said he wanted to promote a 'united and diverse' nation when he takes over as king, as he and his wife Princess Letizia visited an awards ceremony at an ancient monastery church in north eastern Spain.

He received a standing ovation at the San Salvador de Leyre Monastery, near Pamplona, where 
he awarded a cultural prize to a 90-year-old Franciscan 
friar-historian.

His wife Princess Letizia, a
 former television journalist dubbed the nation's first 'Middle Class 
Queen' by Spanish media, also attended the event.

The
 prince did not specifically mention Spain's economic difficulties or 
the drive in the northeastern region Catalonia for a secession vote in 
November, but said the country is going through 'difficult times' that 
require Spaniards to put 'the common good in front of special 
interests.'

The 
crown prince will become King Felipe VI as early as June 18 following 
Monday's announcement by King Juan Carlos that he will abdicate.

Juan Carlos said he plans to abdicate 
because his son is ready for the job and because the country needs new 
royal blood to lead it.

Speaking publicly for the first time since the abdication was announced, Felipe said he wanted to promote a 'united and diverse' nation when he takes over as king

Felipe, 46, has managed to avoid being tarnished by scandals that have hurt the popularity of his 76-year-old father.

Juan Carlos is widely respected for leading Spain's transition from dictatorship to democracy and staring down a 1981 coup attempt.

But his reputation took a big blow following a secret 2012 elephant hunting trip to Botswana at the height of Spain's financial crisis.

The trip became public after Juan Carlos fell and broke his hip, forcing him to take a private jet back to Spain for treatment.

The king's son-in-law, Inaki Urdangarin, is being investigated on suspicion of embezzling large amounts in public contracts.

Juan Carlos' youngest daughter, Princess Cristina, was forced to testify this year in the fraud and money-laundering case targeting her husband, an Olympic handball medalist turned businessman.
