A door bell saved the life of a pooch trapped underground in a rabbit hole for four days.

Henry, a border terrier, darted down the hole near his home in Prestbury, Cheshire, and was so far underground firefighters couldn't even find him using a 'snake eye' camera.

A crew member then suggested they make the dog bark – and owner Beverley Leonard remembered that though her beloved pet rarely made a noise, he always responded to the door bell.

Henry didn't bark much which made him difficult to find, but he always responded to the sound of the doorbell as his Cheshire home so his owner rang it through an amplifier to help locate him

She rushed back home, took the bell from the door, and rang it at every rabbit hole she could find – until they finally found Henry.

The seven-year-old had had race out into a field and disappeared and because he didn't bark much Ms Leonard couldn't find him.

After three days of fruitless searching, the animal rescue unit from Knutsford Fire Station were called to help.

The crew used a ‘snake eye’ camera for confined spaces and spent several hours searching the fields, but called off the search when no sign of Henry could be found.

But after ripping the door bell off her front door and using an amplifier, Ms Leonard was able to find Henry, and then called the firefighters back to finish the job.

She said: 'It must have been just about the last hole in the last field, and we were about to give up, when we heard him.

'I rang the fire service’s animal rescue unit again, they'd said they would come back if there were any developments, and they got here quickly.

'They had to saw through a holly bush and dig until they got to Henry. When they got him up it was like we’d won the World Cup. Everyone was cheering and so happy Henry was fine.'

Henry is now back at home, safe and well.

Ms Leonard had nothing but praise for his rescuers, saying: 'Every one of them was incredibly sympathetic and they didn’t want to leave even when we though all was lost.'
