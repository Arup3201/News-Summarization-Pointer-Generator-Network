The human foot found on a southeast Florida beach on New Year's Day has been matched by investigators using DNA to a missing local boater, who media reports say lost a brother in similar circumstances.

Dominic Porcaro, 64, had been missing since December 19, when his boat washed ashore in Juno Beach in Palm Beach County.

The foot - which was inside a tube sock and midsize white New Balance athletic shoe - was found 13 days later by a beach walker about 20 miles north.

DNA profiling confirms that the appendage belonged to Porcaro, a resident of Jupiter, said Amanda Phillips, a spokeswoman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

Police have confirmed a severed human foot that washed ashore a southeast Florida beach on New Years Day belonged to 64-year-old Dominic Porcaro, who had just been released from jail on a drink driving charge when he went missing on December 19

The day before he went missing, Porcaro was released from the Palm Beach County Jail, where he had been booked on a drunk driving charge, according to media reports.

Dominic's younger brother, John Anthony Porcaro, disappeared from his Hollywood, Florida, home in June 1998, after going fishing, according to the Palm Beach Post.

John Anthony Porcaro was an alleged associate of the Gambino crime family in New York, according to an FBI 'Wanted' notice, and was indicted by a federal grand jury in 2003 for involvement in a South Florida telemarketing scheme in which more than 400 people were defrauded of more than $5 million.

According to media reports at the time, he left a note for his wife, Filamena, saying: 'Fil, went fishing, got call, swordfish are biting. Love, J. I'll call you later.'

John Anthony Porcaro has not been seen since, and no body has been found.

An autopsy on the severed foot belonging to Dominic Porcaro concluded that it likely separated naturally from the decomposing body in the water, either by the force of waves or by a large fish or shark shaking the remains, according to Martin County Sheriff William Snyder.

But the cause of death remains under investigation, Phillips said.

'We're not calling it because it's not enough information to go on,' he said.

Porcaro's 26-foot boat had run aground near the Jupiter Inlet with damage to the bow, but no blood or personal items were found on board, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

The foot was one of three discoveries of human remains found on area beaches in recent weeks.

A body discovered Saturday along the Jupiter shoreline was that of a Sebastian woman also reported missing December 19.

A human bone fragment also was found on a Tequesta beach December 28.

According to Fox News, at least 14 human feet clad in shoes have been found on or near beaches in Washington state and British Columbia since 2007.

The strange discoveries have led to theories involving a serial killer and the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean.

Only a few of the feet to wash ashore in Canada and Washington in recent years have been identified.

Dr. Michael Baden, who served as New York City's Chief Medical Examiner, said that while clothed bodies don't last long in the sea, feet inside shoes can last for years in the ocean.

'The bones start separating naturally as the soft tissue deteriorates,' Baden said.

'And when it comes to the feet, the shoes can really keep those 26 bones [that make up each foot] together.

'Shoes and sneakers tend to be sturdy enough that they can persist for years and decades and they will protect whatever is inside them.'
