A female bodybuilder has been charged with domestic violence after she allegedly kicked in the windshield of her boyfriend's truck and tackled him, police said on Monday.

Dani Reardon, 24, was reportedly drunk and screaming when she was arrested shortly before 2am on Sunday in Edgewood, Florida after hitting her boyfriend.

Her partner of three years, Ian Schofield, said he did not want to press charges against the award-winning bodybuilder for the attack or the damage to his truck.

She was charged with resisting arrest without violence and battery (domestic violence).

According to the police report, Reardon, who was wearing a white dress, was screaming at other party guests, pulling out plants and hitting vehicles in the early hours of Sunday after her boyfriend tried to take her home from a party where she had become 'tipsy'.

Police apprehended the bodybuilder as she was sitting in the car beating the dashboard alongside a man in the driver's seat, believed to be Mr Schofield.

She initially stuck her hand in one officer's face and resisted arrest before calming down and complying.  

As she was driven to the Orange County Jail, Ms Reardon, who is 5ft and weighs 120lb, slammed her head against the cage in the patrol vehicle's backseat.  She was booked and later released.  

When asked if he wanted to press charges after being hit, the man told police: 'C'mon, it's just a girl.'
