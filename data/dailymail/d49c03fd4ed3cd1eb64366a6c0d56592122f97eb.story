A convicted murderer serving a life sentence who is suffering from inoperable cancer has been granted parole so that she can die outside prison walls.

Kristina Joy Fetters was just 14-years-old when a jury convicted her of stabbing her 73-year-old great aunt, Arlene Klehm, to death while attempting to rob her house in Polk County, Iowa in 1995.

Fetters had escaped a mental institution for juveniles in Des Moines with another girl earlier in the day.

Court documents at the time indicate Fetters wanted to take jewelry and money, however her attorneys denied this and mounted an insanity defense.

Kristina Fetters, 33, is dying of inoperable breast cancer. At 14 she was sentenced to life in prison for murdering her great aunt. After 15 years behind bars, she has been granted compassionate release and will be paroled to a hospice

This is Kristina Fetters in 1995 during her murder trial. She had escaped a mental institution the same day she stabbed her 73-year-old great aunt to death

On October 25, 1995, Kristina Fetters, 14, escaped from an Iowa mental institution before coming here, to the Polk County home of her great aunt and stabbing the 73-year-old to death

She was tried as an adult and given life without parole, becoming the youngest woman in Iowa to have received such a sentence.

Now 33, Fetters has been granted compassionate release after a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling.

In September she was diagnosed with inoperable State Four breast cancer.

The cancer has since spread to different other parts of her body and taken her ability to walk.

Fetters is helped each day by trained inmates in the Iowa Correctional Institution for Womenâ€™s hospice unit.

Sister Sandy Rodemyer, one of the prison volunteers who help Fetters, said there was no point keeping the sick woman in prison.

'What good would it do?' she told KCCI 8.

'She's dying, she's no threat to anybody.'

Kristina Fetters has been in prison for 15 years and will now be paroled to a hospice, where she is expected to die from breast cancer

'Many young people do some pretty dumb things in life, and to make them stay in prison until the day they die in some cases is probably more than society needs to demand from that person,' said Sen. Pam Jochum

The Iowa Parole Board has now determined Fetters, who has been hospitalized for pain recently, would recieve better treatment outside of prison.

The board also determined that, while Fetters had not been a model prisoner, she did not pose a threat to society due to her condition.

The high court said that life sentences without parole are unconstitutional for juveniles.

Fetters family say they have forgiven her for killing her great aunt and that her release 'will bring closure'.

Fetters has remained close with her mother, Denise Fetters.

'This has been a 19 year old tragedy for my family,' said Nancy Olson, Fetters' aunt.

Should Kristina Fetters respond to hospic cancer treatments, she will likely be returned to prison, pending another parole board review

In a 2009 interview, Fetters said she deserved her sentence and took full responsibility for her actions.

'I take full responsibility,' she said.

'I don't justify - I can't justify - my behavior.

'I took her life.'

Pending approval by the 5th Judicial district, Fetters is expected to be moved to hospice care within two weeks.
