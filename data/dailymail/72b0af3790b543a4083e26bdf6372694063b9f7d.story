World 
super middleweight champion Carl Froch is swapping the ring for a pommel
 horse after signing up to take part in the BBC1's new celebrity talent show, Tumble, this August.

Tumble,
 which will air on BBC One on Saturday nights, will see the 36-year-old 
boxer compete with a number of celebrities across a range of disciplines.

Froch, who
 beat George Groves in their grudge rematch in May, will be 
judged by Olympic gymnast Louis Smith - himself back on the professional
 scene after a hiatus.

Power couple: Boxing champ Carl Froch has been paired with a petite gymnast partner Sita Bhuller

Meet the gymnasts: The famous faces behind the BBC's first Tumble showdown include Amelle Berrabah, 'H' Watkins and Bobby Lockwood

Nottingham-born Froch has yet to confirm his future plans in the wake of his eighth-round stoppage of Groves at Wembley. He
 has expressed a desire to fight in Las Vegas before retiring, while 
options of a domestic scrap with James DeGale and a straight-up 
retirement have not been ruled in or out.

Froch will be joined on the show by the likes of Girls Aloud's Sarah Harding, Steps' Ian 'H' Watkins and Sugababes' Amelle Berrabah.

'After
 a fight of such magnitude it will be great for me to get my body and 
mind stuck straight into a new discipline,' Froch said.

'I
 am excited to learn these new skills as gymnastics, backflips and 
somersaults are something that have always impressed me and I have 
wanted to be able to do.'

Froch has been paired with petite circus skilled gymnast Sita
 Bhuller to offset his sizeable build.Â 

Finisher: Carl Froch knocked out George Groves last month at Wembley

Waiting game: Froch has not decided if he will fight again but will appear in TV show Tumble in the meantime

Also in the line up are Wolfblood actor Bobby Lockwood, EastEnders' John Partridge and Dynasty actress Emma Samms.

Mentored
 by Olympic gold medalist Beth Tweddle and judged by gymnast and 
Strictly Come Dancing winner Smith, the competing contestants will 
certainly be in good hands for the channel's first gymnastics project.

The
 celebrities have also been paired with an eclectic mix of circus 
performers, acrobats and gymnasts as their official training comes to an
 end for the start of live shows on 9 August, hosted by The One Show's 
Alex Jones.

The fitness expert and former GMTV personality Derrick Evans, aka Mr Motivator, was forced to withdraw after dislocating his knee during a trial run of the show.
