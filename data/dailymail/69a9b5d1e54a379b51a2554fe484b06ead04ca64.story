Amanda Bynes found a soft place to rest amid the turmoil with her parents - a shopping mall couch.

The troubled 28-year-old starlet was pictured reclining and apparently asleep on a turquoise, modern-looking loveseat at The Beverly Center in Los Angeles on Thursday.

According to TMZ, Amanda was staying with friends last week but has been wandering the streets of West Hollywood with nowhere to go and no money for a hotel room.

Amanda appeared to be 'out like a light' while bundled up in a black sweat shirt over a black T-shirt and red track trousers along with comfy slip-on shoes.

Amanda's parents, meanwhile, were pictured moving out of their California home following news they are preparing to give up conservatorship of the actress.

The troubled actress' welfare and finances were put in the control of her mother Lynn Bynes last week, but now she and her husband Rick Bynes are to file legal documents to hand her care over to someone else ahead of their planned move to Texas.

According to TMZ, Amanda's welfare will be in the hands of a mental health professional who specialises in handling people with 'severe mental illnesses', while financial matters will be handled by someone else.

Lynn and Rick - who are relocating from California to be close to their other daughter - are said to hope that transferring the conservatorship will stop the Easy A star from lashing out at them and help repair their relationship with her.

Amanda's parents were seen loading a big moving truck with their belongings on Thursday.

Rick looked quite somber in a pink sports shirt and blue trousers as he shuffled back and forth from the house. 

Lynn did her part by carrying smaller items for packing, wearing navy trousers and a grey T-shirt.

Amanda's conservatorship attorney David Esquibias hasn't commented on the personal aspect changing, but did reveal her financial affairs are to be put in the charge of an unnamed private trust firm, in order to make them more accessible to the actress, noting the star currently has no stable home or the means to rent an apartment.

He told Access Hollywood: 'My goal is to get her permanent adequate housing.'

While the next scheduled conservatorship hearing isn't due to take place until February 2015, it is hoped the matter will be resolved by the end of this week.

The news comes after Amanda - who was recently released from a psychiatric treatment facility in Pasadena, California after being involuntarily committed for the second time on October 10 - hit out on Twitter and expressed her desire to have a new conservator.

She wrote: 'I'm so mad at my parents.'

'We aren't speaking.

'So until I get a different conservator ill look terrible because I don't have enough to get new clothes or anything I need (sic)' 

Serious: The actress seemed to be in the middle of a distressing conversation as she walked through the mall

On Thursday, the outrage continued with Amanda tweeting: 'What is wrong with them?

'My lawyer is working to have them fully removed from being my conservator, because they don't deserve control over my money - They are miserable in their life and I will fight to get control of my finances taken away from them!

'I was not given money for a hotel so i have been staying with friends and i didn't get enough sleep last night so I fell asleep on a couch,' Amanda wrote, adding: '@ the beverly center and a paparazzi snuck in and took pictures of me FYI!

That might explain why Amanda appeared to be sleeping on a couch at the Beverly Center in Los Angeles on Thursday.

TMZ claimed that the actress was 'out like a light...in the middle of the mega-mall.'

The news site went on to explain that Amanda was staying with friends last week, but has been wandering the streets in West Hollywood with apparently no other place to go.

Amanda reportedly has been trying to make arrangements to leave Los Angeles for New York City.

'Her parents have heard that Amanda is asking friends for money to buy a plane ticket to go back to New York. It's really sad that it has disintegrated to this point, but there is little they can do to stop it,' a family insider told RadarOnline.com.

In limbo: Amanda (pictured on October 10) has no stable home or the means to rent an apartment but her attorney told Access Hollywood: 'My goal is to get her permanent adequate housing'

Amanda exhibited bizarre behaviour during an October visit to New York City that included gyrating against her bodyguard at a clothing store in the Big Apple.

The former Nickelodeon star while in New York also fired off tweets accusing her father of molesting her as a child.

She was put on a 72-hour psychiatric hold after returning to Los Angeles and it was extended to a two-week hold in mid-October. 

Resolving the matter: The Bynes' next scheduled conservatorship hearing isn't due to take place until February 2015, but it is hoped the matter will be resolved by the end of this week; they were pictured on Friday
