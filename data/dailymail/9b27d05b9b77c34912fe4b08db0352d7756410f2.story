It's made headlines around the world - scandalised the US (at least according to Good Morning America) and attracted 1000's of (mostly outraged) comments from you on this website.

I am, of course, talking about Sex Box, a new sex talk chat show with a 'spectacularly' quirky twist: three couples will have sex in a box on stage in front of a studio audience, then talk about it afterwards with a panel of experts (I'm one of them.)

Contrary to media hype, the box isn't see-through and made of glass or even 'opaque'. It's made of wood. Thick wood. Picture a Scandinavian hut with a glossy, space age design and you're on the right track.

Inside, it looks like a boutique hotel room. It's soundproof with no cameras, so the couples can't be heard or seen once in there.

Not quite the 'live sex' the media has led you to believe, eh?

No different, in fact, to what happens any time you book into a motel, share a flat with housemates or turn the key in the front door of your terraced home - people are having sex with only a wall separating you.

Yes, it's a cheeky concept. Everyone involved was braced for offence and outrage to be the initial reactions. But it's done for a  reason - to get people to watch a grown-up discussion about sex on mainstream TV.

It had to be challenging to attract an audience. We want people to watch it.

But whether you tune in to tut-tut or tune in to be educated (the aim of the show), I guarantee if you stick with it for 10 minutes (about the time it takes for the clunkiness of a new format to settle in), you won't just be pleasantly surprised, you'll find it compelling viewing.

Here's how it works: while each of the three couples are in the box (with a 30 minute time limit), Mariella Frostup, who hosts the show, international syndicated sex columnist Dan Savage, psychotherapist Phillip Hodson and me, discuss issues relating to the couple in the box.

The Couple: Des Lashimba and Lynette Ellis, one of the couples to appear on Sex Box

For example, when our first young couple are in the box, we talk about porn and the effect it has on a generation who have grown up with it.

What can be done to keep female desire going long-term - with surprising insights - was a topic debated for our mature couple. Just what gay men really get up to in bed, was the myth-busting eye-opening debate for the gay male couple.

The Premise: A couple have sex inside a large box in front of a live studio audience

These discussions are tasteful, intelligent, warm and often funny. They are also educational, challenging harmful sexual myths that confuse and stop lots of people enjoying a healthy, enjoyable sex life.

The discussions are so interesting, by the time the couple come out of the box, you'll have forgotten they were in there!

When they do emerge - mostly loved up, a little tussled and glowing with a post-coital mix of 'I hope to Christ Aunt Martha's not watching' and 'This is cool - I'm making history here and changing people's attitudes to sex' emotion- they join us for a chat about what they got up to in there.

I've never seen a more refreshingly honest, open conversation about what real people do in bed in my life - and I've been studying sex and relationships for the last 25 years.

What is it that makes it so extraordinary?

The very premise that's causing all the ho-ha: the couples talk about sex immediately after they've finished doing it.

We got the idea from sex therapists and educators who sometimes get their clients to talk about sex immediately after they've had it, so their thoughts and issues are fresh in their minds.

I expected honesty and a little embarrassment. What I didn't expect was just how tender the couples would be once they came out of the box.

It was incredibly sweet to watch them interact and remarkably inspiring.

The point of Sex Box isn't just to educate, we're hoping it will encourage couples to start their own conversations about their own  sex lives. Talk about what's working and what isn't.

The show will normalise sex for many people watching, surprise even more and hopefully leave all with a more realistic view of what really happens in bedrooms across Britain, rather than what pornography, movies or telly would have us believe.

What do you have to lose by giving it a chance and tuning in?

Sex Box is on Channel 4 on Mondays at 10pm. It is part of Channel 4's Campaign for Real Sex.
