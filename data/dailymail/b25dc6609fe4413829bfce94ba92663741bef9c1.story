Roma captain Francesco Totti all but accused Juventus of match-fixing after his side's 3-2 defeat in Turin on Sunday night.

Juventus were awarded two dubious penalties, both converted by Carlos Tevez, as Roma's 100 per cent start to the Serie A season was ended.

The 'Old Lady' were stripped of two Serie A titles and relegated to Serie B after the 2006 Calciopoli scandal embroiled them in match-fixing.

And veteran World Cup winner Totti hinted that he feels something similar is going on at the moment.

'Juventus ought to have their own league, as by hook or by crook they always win,' the 38-year-old told Sky Italia.

'Are we back to the same doubts? I am not the only one saying this, as these are things everyone in Italy should discuss.

'With Juventus when there is any doubt whatsoever, it’s always a penalty. I have to stop now, as if I keep talking then I’ll get suspended.'

Juventus sporting director Giuseppe Marotta responded furiously to Totti's allegations.

He said: 'I have great respect for Totti as a player. It’s understandable that he’s upset about the result but what he said was unacceptable.

'In the past Juve have had to bear the brunt for others' mistakes, but when the team has won it has won legitimately and deservingly from a footballing point of view.

'Every year Juventus are accused of being favoured in dubious or unclear situations, but I believe that these decisions even themselves out over the course of a season.

'When we won the penalty it reminded me of the Juventus v Roma match that was played at the Olimpico in Turin. That year Roma got the decision and this year it was our turn to get a penalty.'

Juventus were promoted back to Serie A in 2007 and won their third successive title this year.

Rocchi's performance has sparked a huge controversy in Italy, especially in the wake of Totti's comments
