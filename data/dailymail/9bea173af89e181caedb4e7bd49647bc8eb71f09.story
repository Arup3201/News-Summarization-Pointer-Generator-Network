The Scottish Professional Football League say it will take no action against Celtic or Rangers over the actions of their supporters during the Scottish League Cup semi-final.

The Hoops beat their Glasgow rivals 2-0 at Hampden Park earlier this month in the first meeting of the sides for three years.

But the match was marred by sectarian chants from the Rangers support, while Celtic fans set off flares and unveiled a banner mocking the Ibrox club's liquidation saga.

Police made 12 arrests at the match for sectarian singing but the SPFL say both clubs took measures to limit crowd disturbances.

A spokesman for The SPFL said: 'Official reports from the match are still awaited. 

'However, it is clear from information already received that all parties prepared properly and thoroughly for the match and, to date, we have not seen any evidence of any breach of SPFL Rules by either club.'
