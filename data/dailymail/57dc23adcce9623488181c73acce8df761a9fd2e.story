A mother with terminal cancer has moved into the same nursing home as her severely disabled daughter so she can spend her dying days with her.

Peggy Marney's daughter Pauline was a successful architect until an unexplained brain haemorrhage at the age of 37 left her unable to eat, walk or talk, and in need of round-the-clock care.

Last November the elderly Mrs Marney, 87, was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer and given six months to live.

In a bittersweet twist of fate, she was admitted to the same Buckinghamshire nursing home as her daughter, now 59.

For the past 22 years, she has visited sung to Pauline every day - and the fact the pair now live together means she can continue to do so.

Neither women are strong enough to walk to each other, so staff at the Highclere Nursing Home in Milton Keynes, push one to the other in their wheelchairs.

Mrs Marney, a great-grandmother, then gently sings the classic Let The Rest Of The World Go By as Pauline follows along.

Pauline also has a son John, who was four when she suffered her devastating haemorrhage.

Mrs Marney's other daughter, teaching assistant Kathy, 51, said the family are comforted by the fact her mother and sister are spending her mother's final days together.

She said: 'Pauline was never well enough to come home because she needs 24/7 attention.

'We really don’t know what she is capable of but she is still very limited. It’s not like she is just locked in her body.

Mrs Marney's other daughter Kathy Lake, 50, (left with her mother and sister) said it brings the family great comfort knowing Mrs Marney and Pauline are together

'Sometimes you get a smile and whenever 
my mum sings to her she mouths along. The song is really special to all 
of us as mum used to sing it when we were children.

'I’m sure my mum would agree with me when I say that she knows us.

'We have no idea how long Pauline will live. She is in her own little bubble which means she has no stress. She could live longer than any of us.

'My mum is a lot more ill. It does help that they are in the same care home because my mum is on limited time.

'I think her knowing that they are in the same building is comforting for her.'Vivien Pereira, Home Manager at Bupa’s Highclere Nursing Home said: 'We’re happy that Peggy and Pauline can live together within our home.

'We know how important it is for Peggy to be close to her daughter so they can continue spending time and special moments together.'
