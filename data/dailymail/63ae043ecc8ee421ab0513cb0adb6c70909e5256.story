Most people won't do 400 pull-ups during their lifetime.

Mark Jordan of Corpus Christi, Texas, did more than 4,000 in 24 hours. 

Jordan, 54, did 4,321 pull-ups over the course of two days to become the new Guinness World Record holder.

Mark Jordan of Corpus Christi, Texas, did 4,321 pull-ups in November of 2014 to break the world record

Even though he broke the record last year, Guinness made it official and awarded Jordan a certificate last week

He broke the record in 24 hours on November 3 and 4 in 2014 during a fundraiser for a charity called HELP, the Hammonds Education Leadership Program.

The previous record was 4,210, according to WFAA. 

After breaking the record in November, Jordan wrote on Facebook: 'To all of my friends, new-found, long-standing and true, for all of your posts of encouragement, love and support, I truly thank you from the bottom of my heart! 

'What you have done and continue to do for this endeavor goes beyond words! 

'Some of our most noted accomplishments as individuals never really occur completely by ourselves, even if it is started by us as individuals.' 

Jordan, 54, performed the record-breaking feat during a fundraiser for a charity group called HELP

The record was made official on Wednesday when he received his certificate at the Corpus Christi Crossfit gym, KRIS TV reported. 

Jordan said he hopes his record will inspire others to take care of their health 'no matter what age you are'.

He settled on 4,321 because he was tired and for another reason.

Jordan said: 'It was a combination of things.

'One, I was looking to pass the previous record that was set. 

'And then upon passing that record, I had a little bit of energy left and so as we got closer to getting very tired, I saw 4-3-2-1 as something that was really easy to remember and something that I was shooting for.'

A man who tried to break the record in July was forced to stop after the muscles in his arm started to tear and he had to be briefly hospitalized
