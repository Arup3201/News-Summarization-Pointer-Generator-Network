This is the shocking moment a driver was knocked down by his own van after he tried to stop a thief making off with it – after he left the keys in the ignition at a petrol station.

The 43-year-old motorist's van was targeted at Dean Service Station in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, after he went into the petrol station and left his van unattended with the keys inside.

An 'opportunistic thief' jumped into the driver's seat and drove the van, which was loaded with tools, off the forecourt. 

The thief jumped into the unattended van and started to drive it off the forecourt. CCTV footage shows the driver running out of the shop and attempting to stop the van by putting his hand up in front of the bonnet

The driver then attempts to run in front of his van as part of a desperate attempt to stop the thief making off with it. The white van was loaded with tools and equipment, including a laptop, at the time of the incident

The driver can be seen in the CCTV video being struck by the van, as the thief continues to make his getaway

However, as he did so, the motorist saw his van being taken and ran out of the garage shop, jumping in front of the moving van in a bid to stop the thief.

He was knocked to the ground in the broad daylight incident on December 29, but escaped without serious injury.

The van was found abandoned a few days later, with a laptop missing. 

Police have now released CCTV footage of the incident as part of desperate attempts to trace the thief.

Detective Sergeant Chris Mannion, from Greater Manchester Police, said: 'This was an opportunistic robbery, the thief saw the keys left in the ignition, ran over to the van and drove.

'When the victim saw what was happening he tried to protect his livelihood and ran into the path of the moving van.

'Luckily for him he was not badly hurt, but that doesn't take away the fact he had his van stolen with equipment in the back.
