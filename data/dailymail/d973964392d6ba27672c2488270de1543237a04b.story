Toronto Mayor Rob Ford 'appeared intoxicated' and invited an unidentified woman into his office for an hour when City Hall was closed for a public holiday just days before he entered rehab, according to a security report released Friday.

The City Hall report, released Friday after a freedom of information request, said Ford was 'slurring his words, red in the face, and sweating profusely' when he asked a security guard to 'bring her up' just before 8 p.m. on April 21, Easter Monday. The report said the woman left Ford's office after an hour.

'Stumbling': the mayor's feet can be seen moving in the video. His brother Doug Ford has called the movements 'muscle spasms' from lifting weights

Ford remains in rehab for alcohol addiction after announcing in April that he was seeking treatment after another video surfaced that apparently showed him smoking crack.

Ford admitted last year after reports of a similar video that he had smoked crack in a 'drunken stupor,' following months of denials. That was just one of many public incidents of bad behavior that led the City Council to strip him of most of his powers. The mayor had become an international sensation, with late-night TV comedians in the U.S. repeatedly skewering him.

The City Hall security report from April 21 said that Doug Ford, the mayor's brother and a city councilor, arrived later at City Hall and escorted his brother and a different security guard to the parking garage.

'The mayor can be seen stumbling and even falling on the ground before being seated in the vehicle,' the report states. Security footage shows Doug Ford in the driver's seat.

Doug Ford attributed his brother's behavior to 'muscle spasms' that night.

'He had muscle spasms in his legs but that is about as far as I saw,' Ford said in an interview with the Toronto Sun.

'He was bench pressing a lot of weight and it was ripping up his legs and [he was] just trying to stretch his legs out to get the spasms away,' Doug added. 'He could barely even walk because they were so sore.'

Mystery woman: the unidentified guest of Rob Ford, seen in this file photo, is 'a friend of the family' according to his brother

Doug told the paper the woman was 'a friend of the family.'

'It wasn’t some mysterious woman, I know her very well, Renata [Ford] knows her very well, Rob knows her very well,' Ford said to the Sun. 'There is no big secret about a woman showing up. I love how they twist everything it is just staggering.'

Doug Ford didn't return messages to the Associated Press seeking comment.

The Globe and Mail newspaper reported in late April that it viewed a second video of Ford smoking what appears to be crack cocaine in his sister's basement days before he entered rehab. The Toronto Sun said that it had obtained an audio recording of Ford making offensive remarks about other politicians at a bar a few nights later.

Ford has not abandoned his bid to seek a second term in October elections. His decision to seek treatment comes months after he announced he was finished with alcohol — only to have steady reports of more intoxicated behavior emerge.

Doug Ford has said he expects his brother to return to the campaign by June 30.
