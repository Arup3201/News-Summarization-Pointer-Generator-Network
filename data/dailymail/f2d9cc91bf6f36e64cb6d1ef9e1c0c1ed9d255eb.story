A photographer has captured an incredibly rare glimpse of one of the most secretive drone programmes on the planet.

Known as 'the Avenger', the drone has already been tested in Afghanistan, and can be easily spotted by its distinctive 'goldeneye' glass, which shield's the delicate sensing optics system.

It can cruise at 400mph, fly up to 60,000 feet depending on the configuration and can stay airborne for over 18 hours.

Maximum speed: 460 mph; 741 km/h (400 kn)

Endurance: 20 hours with standard fuel

Service ceiling: 60,000 ft (18,288 m) operating altitude

Can house about 3,500 lbs of smart bombs

Can be controlled by a single pilot

Aviation photographer Ian Tate caught quite the secret craft in action at General Atomics' drone plant located in the Mojave Desert.

He was hoping to photograph a Predator or Reaper UAVs, but instead he caught one of the elusive test drones.

General Atomics, which also makes nuclear reactors and maglev trains, already makes many of the most popular military drones, including the Predator.

The idea behind the Avernger was to design an unmanned plane that had modular sensors, good performance, good stealth, and good payload, and could be used as a workhorse' drone.

The Avenger will also be equipped with an electro-optical targeting system that will preserve its stealthy radar signature by placing the aircraft's optics behind a series of gold plated, faceted windows.

The firm is also believed to have tested the Avenger with its new Advanced Cockpit Ground Control Station, which features wrap around screens that repeat the video feed from a distributed camera system mounted around the Avenger.

It is also rumored that the Avenger is also being developed with a signals and communications intelligence payload for eavesdropping on the enemy, even while loitering over their own airspace.

The Avenger can house about 3,500 lbs of smart bombs, including small diameter bombs (SDB) that can glide over 50 miles from the Avenger's height, and strike threatening enemy radar emitters as they pop up.

The firm is also believed to have tested the Avenger with its new Advanced Cockpit Ground Control Station, which features wrap around screens that repeat the video feed from a distributed camera system mounted around the Avenger.

The Avenger is set to be a general purpose drone, and is believed to have already been used in Afghanistan.

The Avenger can stay airborne for over 18 hours, and possibly longer if fuel tanks are installed in its weapons bay.

In December 2011, the Air Force announced that it had ordered an Avenger and that it was being deployed to Afghanistan.

'This aircraft will be used as a test asset and will provide a significantly increased weapons and sensors payload capacity on an aircraft that will be able to fly to targets much more rapidly than the MQ-9 [Reaper] UAS,' the USAF said in an announcement.

'Since it has an internal weapons bay and four hardpoints on each wing it will also allow greater flexibility and will accommodate a large selection of next generation sensor and weapons payloads.'

It can cruise at 400mph, and reach up to 60,000 feet depending on the configuration
