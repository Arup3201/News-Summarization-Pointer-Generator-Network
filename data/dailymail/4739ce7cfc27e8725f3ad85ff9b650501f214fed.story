Oakham Under 15s centre Tyrese Johnson-Fisher impressed with an amazing display of finishing, scoring four tries against Bishop Wordsworth's School to help his side reach their first NatWest Schools Cup final in 10 years. 

Johnson-Fisher is the latest in a long line of rugby stars to emerge from the independent school in Rutland, which also educated Rob Cook, Tom Croft, Ron Jacobs, Lewis Moody and Matt Smith.    

The teenager was effectively untouchable as he floated effortlessly between the flailing Bishop Wordsworth's challenges, feinting one way before turning another with blistering pace.

Boarding fees at Oakham school total at £29,940 per year, while day fees are £17,970 per year.
