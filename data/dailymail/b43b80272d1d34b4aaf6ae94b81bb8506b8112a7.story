Harry Redknapp has offered dubious support to Malky Mackay - the football manager accused of sending racist texts - insisting: 'He hasn't murdered anyone, he hasn't raped anyone and he is not a paedophile.' 

The Queens Park Rangers manager made the controversial remark days after it was claimed Mackay had exchanged a series of racist, sexist and homophobic text messages with Iain Moody while they were at Cardiff City football club.

Mr Redknapp believes the Scot should be given the chance to redeem himself, adding: 'He's made a mistake and it shouldn't end his football career.'

But Troy Townsend, the education and development manager for the anti-discrimination campaign group Kick It Out has been left dismayed by the comments.

'What he has said has no benefit at all. I don't know what is in Harry's head when he's saying that.

'(Mackay's alleged comments) have anti-Semitic and racial connotations and at the end of the day it's affecting a group of people and we should be more respectful of those people.

'What Harry has said shows a lack of understanding about the situation. These are really sensitive issues and you have to respect the reasons behind them. He's almost saying 'it ain't that bad is it?', but unfortunately for some people, it is.'

The text exchanges outlined in the Daily Mail's exclusive report date back to when Mackay and Moody worked as manager and head of recruitment at Cardiff City, before both were sacked by club owner Vincent Tan amid claims of over-spending in the transfer market.

Mackay's agent Raymond Sparkes later told Sky Sports News that he was 'shocked and stunned' after details of the texts were released.

The League Managers' Association said the club had searched more than 10,000 private text messages and found two from Mackay adding, intially, that they were 'with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures'. 

One of the texts he and Moody are alleged to have shared said: 'He's a snake, a gay snake. Not to be trusted', referring to an official at another club 

Former Tottenham manager Redknapp says he acknowledges that Mackay and Moody had made a 'big mistake' but that Mackay was a 'great fella, a family man, a football man'.

He added: ‘Suddenly everybody's an angel. It shouldn't finish his life he's a top manager and I feel really sorry for him.

‘I'm not condoning what he's done but he's not a bad person, he's a fantastic lad. Show me somebody who's never made a mistake and I’ll show you a liar.

‘He's not a rapist, he's not a paedophile. He's made a mistake and it shouldn't end his football career.

‘I'm lucky I don’t send text messages but I do get silly message with sick jokes on them from time to time.’

Mackay was set to be named as the new Crystal Palace manager before he dropped out of the running after the club learned of the evidence that was passed to the FA.

Moody, meanwhile, resigned from his position as Palace’s sporting director.

On Thursday, the League Managers Association issued a statement on behalf of Mackay - before a backlash forced them into a humbling apology.

The original statement read: ‘In the course of a search by the club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one-line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. 

‘These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter.’

But less than 24 hours later, a second statement was released: 'The LMA apologises for some of its wording, in its release yesterday, which was inappropriate and has been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist, sexist or homophobic nature. That was certainly not our intention. 

'It is beyond argument that any comments that are discriminatory, even used in private, are totally unacceptable.  

'The LMA will not be commenting further on the allegations relating to Malky Mackay whilst The FA conducts its investigation, other than to repeat that both the LMA and Malky will be cooperating fully.

'We will continue to work with all of the game's stakeholders to address the important issues of respect and discriminatory behaviour in all its forms.'
