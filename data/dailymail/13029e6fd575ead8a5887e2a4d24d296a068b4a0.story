In the wild they may be known as vicious killers, but this captive polar bear shows the species has a softer side too.

Filmed at Rio Grande Zoo in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the video shows a swimming polar bear throwing a Frisbee to a boy watching behind the wire enclosure.

According to the boy's father, Miguel Armenta, the bear had been throwing the disc for a while, trying to get it high enough for his son to catch.

A polar bear has been filmed playing catch with a boy at Rio Grande Zoo in Albuquerque. The video captures the moment the bear throws the Frisbee high enough for the boy to catch

The short clip then captures the moment the bear finally manages the perfect throw, which is expertly caught by the boy.

There are two polar bears kept at Rio Grande Zoo, twins Kiska and Koluk, though it is not known which one is in the video.

The pair are clearly fun-loving animals as their enclosure includes a 14ft waterslide, along with an air-conditioned ice cave, a 14ft deep swimming pool and waterfalls.

According to the boy's father, Miguel Armenta, the bear had been throwing the Frisbee for some time, trying to get it high enough for his son to catch

They were born at Utah's Hogel Zoo in 1996, but moved to Albuquerque in order to have enough space to grow into 1,000lb adults.

In the wild cubs are fun-loving creatures, tackling and wrestling with each other, but adults tend to be unsociable, preferring to hunt and live in isolation.

That doesn't mean they can't enjoy themselves, however, and have often been filmed running and jumping in the snow, or sliding down large snow drifts on their stomachs.
