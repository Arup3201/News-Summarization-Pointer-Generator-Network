The twin brother of the soldier who fatally shot herself in the head at Fort Lee army base revealed on Wednesday that her death 'came out of nowhere' and that she loved being in the military.

Sgt 1st Class Paula Walker was 'in good spirits' when they spoke to her just a week ago, said Paul Walker.

He revealed that the 33-year-old mother-of-one joined up at the age of 19 straight out of high school and was looking forward to retiring from the service and embarking on a second career.

Sgt Walker leaves behind an eight-year-old daughter who will now be cared for by Paul and Paula's mother Flora, 61, of Yonkers, New York.

Loving mother: Sgt Walker was the mother of an eight-year-old girl who served 15 months in Iraq. her twin brother Paul, of Yonkers, New York, told MailOnline she loved her job and 'loved her country'

Mystery: Paul said he spoke to his twin sister a week ago and she was 'in good spirits'. He told MailOnline: 'This was totally unseen. I spoke to her a week ago... you never know what's going on in a person's mind'

Fighting back the tears, Paul told MailOnline: 'She was a great mum, a great daughter, a great all round person.

'I am devastated at the loss of my twin sister. This was totally unseen. I spoke to her a week ago and she was fine and in good spirits. I just don't know, you never know. You never know what's going on in a person’s mind.

'It doesn't make sense to me.'

Sgt Walker died after barricading herself in an office inside a building at the base in Fort Lee, Virginia, where she had been stationed for the last three years.

She is said to have begun was throwing things around and that officials tried to negotiate with her.

Her gun was not a service weapon, officials said.

Sgt Walker's career included a 15-month combat tour in Iraq from 2007 to 2008.

She also served a tour in Afghanistan in 2008 and had been awarded commendations and good conduct medals.

Mr Walker spoke to MailOnline on the doorstep of the family apartment in Yonkers overlooking the Hudson where he and his sister grew up.

Army Major General Stephen Lyons, pictured on Monday, said that he did not know if Sgt Walker was being treated for any mental health issues and could not speculate whether drugs or alcohol were involved

He described her as 'gracious, kind, humble, always thinking about what she's going to say before she said it'.

Sgt Walker put 'God first, then family', Mr Walker said.

He said: 'She was a hard worker. She wanted to be in the military for life - that was her goal, to retire in the army.

'She had been in for 14 years and she liked she was doing. We talked a lot about her being in the military. She liked it. She loved her country, she was patriotic.'

Mr Walker said that his sister had normal stresses like paying the bills and making sure her daughter was ready for the new school year, but nothing serious.

They were not aware that she was being treated for any mental health issues such as PTSD.

Mr Walker said: 'Iraq was tough for her, her daughter was here. It was tough for our mother but Paula came home. It's possible that she kept something behind the facade but I didn't know about it.

'She signed up because it gave her stability which was good for her. She would have retired with a pension and worked a new career, that’s what she was going to do'.

Mr Walker said that he will now be stepping up to raise his niece who he 'welcomes with open arms' and that he wished he could have been there for his sister.

He said: 'What’s hard for me is that she was in such turmoil that she felt she had to do that to herself, to know that your sister is in that place mentally where she feels that's her only option.

'For me as a brother that hurts to know that she thought that'.

When Sgt Walker shot herself, the building she was in had 1,100 people inside but nobody else was hurt.

Maj. Gen. Stephen R. Lyons, the commander of the base at Fort Lee, has said he did not know whether she was being treated for any mental health issues and could not speculate whether drugs or alcohol might have been a factor.

Prior to coming to Fort Lee, Sgt Walker served at Fort Devens, Massachusetts, starting in 2010 and was at Fort Eustis, Virginia, beginning in 2006.

She also served in Hawaii before her tour of Iraq.

Lyons has described Sgt Walker as upset and enraged but said he couldn't say whether that was consistent with her personality.

Active shooter: The Fort Lee base was put in lockdown on Monday after Sgt Walker barricaded herself in a room and started throwing things around, before tragically killing herself

According to the Army, her awards and decorations include three Army Commendation Medals, four Army Achievement Medals, one Joint Meritorious Unit Award and four Army Good Conduct Medals.

Army officials initially labeled the incident involving Sgt Walker, which happened on Monday, an 'active shooter' situation.

The Department of Homeland Security uses the term to describe someone actively trying to kill people, usually in populated areas, with no pattern of choosing victims.

While stationed at Fort Eustis in November 2009, Sgt Walker was interviewed by a reporter over the massacre of 13 people by Maj Nidal Hasan, a military psychiatrist, who opened fire at Fort Hood Army base.

He injured 31 others in the deadliest such attack in history.

In an interview with the Daily Press, a Newport News newspaper, Sgt Walker said: 'People are people. They go through things in life. They either handle stresses in a good way or in a bad way.'
