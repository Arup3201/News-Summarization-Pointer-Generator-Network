As more and more camps ban care packages, parents are turning to increasingly elaborate smuggling routines to send their children goodies at summer camp.

Camp directors have banned the boxes after becoming frustrated with the increasingly over-the-top stuffed toys and huge bags of candy sent by hyper-competitive parents.

Now The New York Times reports that they are fighting back by hollowing out Harry Potter books, stuffing chocolate bars into socks and filling Tampax with candy. 

Sending treats: As more and more camp directors ban care packages, parents are going to greater lengths than ever to smuggle candy and toys to their kids

Many of the camps claim that they rules are in place because the packages promote 
jealousy and attract vermin - but privately many admit that the real 
problem is the adults.

Each camp has 
different restrictions. Some ban toys that look like weapons, while others may
define a care package as something that arrives in a box or padded 
envelope,  or limit the amount that a child can receive.

The website of Camp 
Kabeyun in Alton Bay, New Hampshire warns parents that boys are required to open packages with a counselor - who will confiscate food and candy.

Parents sign contracts saying that they understand the rules, but writer Bruce Feiler claims that they mostly ignore them.

'I heard more techniques for getting Twizzlers into 
camps than getting nail files into prison,' he writes.

Crafty parents tape gum into the pages of magazines, stuff chocolate bars into socks and even replace Tampax with candy. 

Other hiding places include deodorant sticks and pen or pencil boxes.

One Girl Scout camp alum told the paper that her mom would open a box of tissues, remove the bottom half, fill with candy and use a hot-glue gun to reseal.  

Clinical psychologist Christopher 
Thurber said that after finding out that the New Hampshire camp where he
works has a no-phone policy, a parent smuggled a fully-charged cell 
phone inside a teddy bear.

The term 'care package' originated
after World War II when the Cooperative for American Remittances to 
Europe (CARE) began sending food to Europe, where many people were at risk of starvation.

Over the next two decades, more than 100 million packages were delivered
around the world.

Over time, the phrase became a generic term for 
goodies sent to people away from home. For kids attending summer camp in the 1970s and 1980s, care packages were filled with Oreos, Twinkies, M&Ms and clothing.

Now the stakes are higher, and parents feel that they have to keep up. There are now even online retailers offering customized care packages to cater to parents too busy to fill their own boxes.

Malcolm Petty, co-owner of Sealed With a Kiss care-package distributor, tells the paper that the company faces twice as many restrictions on delivery today as in 2007.

Bobby Strauss, the director of Camp Wigwam
in Maine, says that he still allows care packages, but encourages families to send no more than three a season. 

And not everyone believes that boxes make the camp experience better. Dr 
Thurber, an author of The Summer Camp Handbook, said his research 
found care packages make no difference in separation anxiety.

If parents
must send something, he suggests a board game or a deck of cards.
