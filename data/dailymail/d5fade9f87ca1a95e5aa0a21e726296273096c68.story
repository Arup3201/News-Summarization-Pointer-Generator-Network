Following last week's news that a convoy of dozens of vehicles trucked south from Libya to neighbouring Niger, carrying Muammar Gaddafi's closest supporters - if not the 69-year-old despot himself - it has been reported that one of his sons has also now crossed the border.

A government spokesman for the large, landlocked West African country - over 80 per cent of which is the Sahara Desert - confirmed that 37-year-old Saadi Gaddafi, a former footballer in Italy, has also fled.

The fugitive dictator's son, who apparently arrived in Niger with nine other people, is one of the most high-profile figures from his regime to have left Libya, if the reports from Justice Minister Amadou Morou are to be believed.

Colonel Gaddafi's third son became known to the wider world when, in 2003, he signed for Italian club Perugia, where he played only one match before failing a drug test.

Formerly on the board of the Italian footballing giants Juventus - of which 7.5 per cent is owned by a Libyan consortium - he was also captain of the Libya national football team, captain of his home club in Tripoli, and president of the Libyan Football Federation.

According to the official, Saadi's convoy of vehicles were travelling south towards the outpost of Agadez, where other fleeing Libyan loyalists are believed to be holed up in a hotel.

'I wish to announce that one of Gaddafi's sons - Saadi Gaddafi - was intercepted in the north of Niger by a patrol of the Nigerian military,' Mr Morou said of the ex-Serie A and international footballer, and businessman.

He said Saadi 'has no status at all' in Niger, indicating that he has not been granted refugee status, which would guarantee him certain rights.

In Tripoli, rebel forces reportedly captured Libya's former prime minister and Gaddafi's head of external intelligence service, Abu Zayd Dourd

Since last week, several convoys carrying senior officials of the former Libyan regime as well as civilians and soldiers have made their way across the porous desert border into Niger.

Among them were several of Gaddafi's top military officers, including his chief-of-security and the head of his southern command.

Niger has faced increasing scrutiny for allowing the former regime members on to its soil, and al-Saadi's arrival will likely intensify international pressure on the country to cooperate with Libya's new rulers.

They want all Gaddafi's sons - and Gaddafi himself, who is on the run - to be handed over for trial.

Last week, the U.S. urged Niger to detain any individuals who may be subject to prosecution in Libya, as well as to confiscate their weapons and impound any state property, such as money or jewels, that were illegally taken out of the country.

While some senior former regime officials have managed to escape, Libya's new leaders have arrested several former high-ranking regime officials since the then-rebel fighters swept into Tripoli on August 21, effectively bring an end to Gaddafi's nearly 42-year rule.

Yesterday, anti-Gaddafi forces in Tripoli captured the former head of the regime's external intelligence service, Abu Zayd Dourda, said Anes Sharif, a spokesman for Tripoli's military council.

A long-time Gaddafi insider, Mr Dourda also served as prime minister in the 1990s.

As Libya's new leaders move to exert their authority in Tripoli, forces loyal to Gaddafi continue to hold out in three strongholds - Sirte on the Mediterranean coast, Sabha in the southern desert, and Bani Walid south east of Tripoli.

According to Al Jazeera, a pro-Gaddafi radio station in Bani Walid is urging residents to rise up against the revolutionaries, promising 'the prettiest girls' in town as a reward.
