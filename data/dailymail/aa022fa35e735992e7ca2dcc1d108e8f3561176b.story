Like many a suburban bungalow, Chris Weller's has a pond and a cat flap. However the pond is in his conservatory... and you might get a shock at what waddles through the cat flap.

For Mr Weller, 66, shares his home with Caesar the crocodile.

The bachelor spent £23,000 converting the property in Rochester, Kent and has moved to the safety of the loft so that his pet is free to roam.

Mr Weller bought Caesar, a spectacled caiman native to the rainforests of central America, six years ago when he was less than 1 ft long.

Friends: This is former prison officer Chris Weller, 66, who has spent more than £25,000 making his detached bungalow in Rochester, Kent, crocodile-friendly for his seven-year-old friend Caesar

Territory: Mr Weller - who spent 40 years working at HMP Rochester - converted the downstairs of his home into a habitat for the crocodile to roam in, including building a pool into his conservatory

Snap! Mr Weller said he enjoys playing cards with Caesar the crocodile at his home in Rochester, Kent

Conversion: Mr Weller moved into the loft of his home to allow the crocodile to roam free, and even installed a cat flap on his conservatory door for easy access into his water bath

He is now seven years old and 5ft 6in - but still growing. His species can live for 40 years and typically reach 7ft.

Mr Weller - who spent 40 years working at HMP Rochester - converted the downstairs of his home into a habitat for the crocodile to roam in, including building a pool into his conservatory.

He said: ‘He’s my closest companion and most of my day revolves around feeding, cleaning and entertaining him. Most people are terrified when they find out I live with a crocodile.

‘But I’ve raised him since he was a baby. Now he’s completely docile. As he’s got older he’s become happier to be around me and he likes nothing more than watching TV and listening to the radio.

Roaming around: Mr Weller had to apply for a dangerous animal licence in order to legally keep Caesar - and with this he has to comply with certain hygiene, diet and security requirements

Swimming: Mr Weller insisted that the kitchen, bathroom and hallway are neutral zones for the pair - but he is still able to stroke him as he rests his head on his lap

Feeding: After preparing his breakfast of meat or fish, Mr Weller cleans his leathery skin and his sanctuary

‘Neighbours, and particularly children, 
like him - and when I go to the butcher’s to get meat and fish for him, 
most people know me as “the man with the croc”. He’s a loyal mate.’

He insisted the kitchen, bathroom and hallway are neutral zones for the pair - but he is still able to stroke him as he rests his head on his lap.

Mr Weller had to apply for a dangerous animal licence in order to legally keep Caesar - and with this he has to comply with certain hygiene, diet and security requirements.

His home has a three-lock system - keeping Caesar behind at least three doors - in order to prevent him from escaping outside. He is also not allowed to be taken outside.

Friends: Mr Weller bought his 5ft 6in companion six years ago when he was less than 1ft long, and said he now enjoys reading stories, watching TV and listening to Classic FM on the radio with the reptile

Decisions: Mr Weller had been planning to buy Caesar a female partner, but he believes this would be too difficult to introduce to his routine

Radio choice: The pair listen to Classic FM as Mr Weller tends to his water monitors and other animals including terrapin turtles, parrots and lizards

Speaking of his time as a prison guard, Mr Weller added: ‘I spent four decades keeping dangerous animals behind locks and gates so it’s no different here.

‘As he’s grown up he’s used to the safety systems. I never have any concerns about going to bed and him waking up next to me.

‘When I first got him he was very difficult to look after and care for as he would often bite me - and it’s as painful as it sounds.

'But now he’s very relaxed and placid. I don’t think there’s any chance of him escaping - he’s not even allowed outside.’

Scary eyes: In his bungalow in Kent, Mr Weller has spent more than 20 years living with man-eating beasts

Pleased to eat you: Mr Weller, 66, preparing Caesar the crocodile's daily meal at his home in Rochester, Kent

Grub's up: Caesar the crocodile investigates the food that has been left for him in Rochester, Kent

Mr Weller had been planning to buy 
Caesar a female partner, but he believes this would be too difficult to 
introduce to his routine.

Instead the owner keeps him company and wakes up every morning at 7am in order to free him and let him roam the downstairs.

After preparing his breakfast of meat or fish, Mr Weller cleans his leathery skin and his sanctuary.

The
pair then listen to Classic FM as Mr Weller tends to his water monitors
and other animals including terrapin turtles, parrots and lizards.

Early days: Mr Weller bought his 5ft 6in crocodile companion six years ago when he was less than 1ft long

Smaller: Caesar the crocodile - who is drawn to flashing lights and images on screen - seen as a youngster

Mr Weller then allows Caesar to watch TV as he’s drawn to flashing lights and images on screen.

He added: ‘Most of the time he’s a grumpy sod and likes to be left alone, but he does enjoy certain things and it’s good to make it a routine - it keeps him relaxed.

‘I never wanted to get a cat or a dog, when you have a home to yourself you think “Well, why not?” -  and just go for it. I wouldn’t dream of having any other pet.’
