A 14-year-old boy accused of stabbing his grandmother more than 50 times went to school afterwards covered in blood, an Atlanta court heard yesterday.

Charles Price is being charged as an adult over the murder of his grandmother, Mary, who was found inside her home on Friday last week.

Police believe the teenager stabbed the 76-year-old in an argument over the television's DVR.

When Price arrived at Therrell High School, a teacher and a police officer who spotted him in a corridor initially thought he had stabbed another student.

He was described as being covered in blood, and allegedly said: 'I killed it,' and liked it, school officials said in their testimony.

Teachers contacted the police, who went to the family's southwest Atlanta home, where they found Mrs Price and a trail of blood from the kitchen to the living room.

Mrs Price had been stabbed at least 57 times, in what officers described as a gruesome scene.

A broken knife was found in the kitchen, and another broken knife was in the living room, WSBTV reported.

One of the teenager's uncles told the court he believed the attack had been triggered by a dispute over the TV.

Mrs Price, whose son is a police officer, died at the scene. The officer is not the father of Charles Price, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

Price is being held without bond and is due to return to court later this month. He is charged with killing his grandmother, alongside at least four other charges.
