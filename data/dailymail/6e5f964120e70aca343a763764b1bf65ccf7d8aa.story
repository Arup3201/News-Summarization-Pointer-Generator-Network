Action: Former Chancellor Alistair Darling claims the English should have a vote on whether a separate Scotland could keep the pound

The English should have a vote on whether a separate Scotland could keep the pound, former Chancellor Alistair Darling has said.

Mr Darling - who leads the pro-union Better Together campaign - suggested that residents in the rest of the United Kingdom could seal the fate of whether an independent Scotland is part of a currency union.

Scottish separatists were given a boost last weekend when an unnamed minister said that ‘of course’ Scotland could keep sterling as part of negotiations.

But that claim - made by an anonymous minister to the Guardian - was slapped down by George Osborne, the Chancellor, and his Treasury deputy Danny Alexander.

Until then, the threat of an independent Scotland losing the pound had been a key argument for the Better Together campaign, which has warned Scots of the economic consequences of quitting the UK.

Only Scots will have a say on whether they get to stay as part of the UK in the September 18 referendum.

But Mr Darling added to the confusion by holding out the possibility of a UK-wide referendum, likening Scots keeping the pound to the controversy about Britain entering the euro.

‘I think people in the rest of the UK do need to have a say as to whether or not they go into a single currency. This is important,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

He added that the major political parties would almost certainly oppose a currency union ‘because it would mean pooled, shared sovereignty in the same ways it would do if you joined the euro’.

The Better Together campaign - and Mr Darling himself - have faced criticism for failing to show the same ‘hunger’ as the separatists’ Yes campaign.

But despite being the man in charge of rescuing the banks during the financial crisis in 2008, Mr Darling insisted that the campaign to save the UK was ‘the most important thing I’ve ever done in my political life’.

But Nicola Sturgeon, the Deputy First Minister of Scotland, accused the Better Together campaign of ‘bluffing’ over Scotland being denied the pound.

She said there was no need for a referendum in the UK ‘for the simple reason that the currency arrangements of the rest of the UK wouldn’t be changing’.

‘They use sterling right now and would continue to use sterling in partnership with Scotland,’ she said.

Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister however insisted that it was ‘flatly wrong’ to claim that Scotland could keep the sterling.

Standing firm: Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, said Scotland could not 'have their cake and eat it' if voters decided to opt out of the UK in the referendum

The Deputy Prime Minister said Scotland could not ‘have their cake and eat it’ if voters decided to opt out of the UK in the September referendum.

A Downing Street spokesman sought to limit the impact of the remarks at the weekend, stating: ‘There will not be a currency union in the event of independence.’ 

The Yes campaign suffered a setback yesterday however when an influential think tank warned that a separate Scotland would not have access to major spy agencies and intelligence.

The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) said an independent Scotland would face huge hurdles in establishing its own spy agency.

It would not have the automatic access to the ‘five eyes’ currently enjoyed as part of the UK which links intelligence agencies in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

Scotland could become vulnerable during the time it would take up to set up a separate a spy agency.

But it could also leave the UK more exposed if terrorists targeted a ‘weaker’ Scotland to inflict atrocities from a more relaxed environment.

‘A weak Scottish security and intelligence capability could make Scotland an attractive environment for hostile intelligence organisations, and provide a route into the UK,’ the think tank warned.

The report warned tensions between the governments of a separate Scotland and the rest of the UK could escalate as a result.
