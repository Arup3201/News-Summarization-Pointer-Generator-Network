Following the death of Hollywood legend Robin Williams, the number of Australians seeking help from the Beyondblue Support Service nearly doubled.

The 63-year-old U.S.acting legend was in the early stages of Parkinson's disease and was struggling with depression and anxiety before he died in his northern California home on August 11.

Beyondblue CEO Georgie Harman said the sheer numbers of Australians who contacted their service following his death showed that many Australians were in need of urgent support.

The Hollywood legend Robin Williams was in the early stages of Parkinson's disease and was struggling with depression and anxiety before he died in his Northern California home on August 11

Ms Harman said there were about 2,200 phone conversations, web chats and email conversations with the Support Service in the 72 hours after his death was announce, up from 1,300 over the same period the week before. These numbers were significantly higher than the long-term average.

'This means someone contacted beyondblue’s Support Service every two minutes for three straight days requesting support or information,' she said.

'During this time, the information the community was looking for was the signs and symptoms of depression, anxiety and suicide risk, and what to do if you’re worried about someone. 

'This extraordinary demand highlights the need to continue educating people about illnesses such as depression and anxiety, which can lead to suicide, and shows that the community wants support people who may be going through a tough time.
