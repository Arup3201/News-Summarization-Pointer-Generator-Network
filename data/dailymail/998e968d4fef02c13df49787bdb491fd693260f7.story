Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew almost came to blows OUTSIDE the ring on Saturday night.

The bitter rivals are on a collision course for a grudge rematch later this year after passing their second tests at cruiserweight with flying colours.

And the pair traded verbal insults after Bellew's victory before the Liverpudlian had to stop himself from clambering out of the ring to meet his aggressor.

Cleverly rose from his seat at ringside and goaded Bellew into putting one foot on the ring apron before he had second thoughts.

Hostilities soon resumed, however, between the two men who first met in the ring in 2011.

On that occasion, Cleverly retained his light-heavyweight world title with a majority decision.

Bellew, who earlier became the first man to stop Brazilian Julio Cesar Dos Santos, told Sky Sports: 'We can do it [the rematch].

Lets get it on: Cleverly and Bellew are due to fight later this year in either London, Liverpool or Manchester

'I ain't a 16 fight novice, I'm an established pro who's fought better pros than you in lesser fights.

'You were a plastic world champion, we fought for a belt that should never have been a world title.

'Forget that defeat, I just want to hurt you.'

Cleverly, who also earned himself an early night with a fourth-round stoppage of Alejandro Emilio Valori, retorted: 'I've already come to his home town once and beaten him and I'll do it again. This time it will be emphatic. I've already beat you and I'll spank you again.'

The rematch is expected to take place in October or November with Liverpool, London and Manchester all in the running as venues.

Bellew looked vulnerable at times before dispatching Dos Santos with a chilling left hook in the fifth round.

He added: 'I wanted rounds and I knew the guy had never been stopped. I wanted to set him up for the perfect shot and boy did I set him up.'

Cleverly was always in control against Valori, an Argentinian who looked exhausted after the second round.

He said: 'I'm happy with that. I said all week that he's a shorter opponent and he'd come out swinging and that's what he did.

Seen it all before: Cleverly and Bellew had to be separated at a press conference back in 2011

'Bit by bit I broke him down. It was a case of taking a few to land a lot more and it was just a matter of time before I took him out.

'That was the perfect fight for my second fight at cruiserweight.

'It's going to be fireworks with that guy from Liverpool.

'Tony, I'm coming for you.'
