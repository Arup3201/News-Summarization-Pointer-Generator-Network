Mike Brown believes RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie was 'spot on' to describe England's RBS 6 Nations performance as unacceptable - but the Red Rose and Harlequins full back still thinks Stuart Lancaster's side are genuine World Cup contenders.

England were only narrowly pipped to the Championship on points difference by Ireland after a dramatic final day and have had praise lavished on them from all quarters for their attacking brand of rugby, which saw them score 18 tries in five matches.

But for Brown, like Ritchie, second place is simply not good enough.

'We're not in there to be second so he's spot on really,' he said. 

'We didn't have an aim of coming second, we had an aim of winning silverware and coming first, so he hasn't said anything we don't agree with or think ourselves.

'We don't accept coming second because we want to win, and that's it.'

Brown has been forced to sit out Harlequins' trip to Wembley to face Saracens in the Aviva Premiership on Saturday with concussion.

If you include the Italy match, when he was taken off after being knocked out in the opening minutes, it will be the third match out of five he has missed through concussion for country and club.

With no game next week though, Brown is hoping an extended break and a holiday in the sun will have him fit and raring to go for the season finale.

Brown said: 'It's disappointing but first and foremost it's about my health and with a big year coming up that's the most important thing for me and England.

'I got a couple of knocks right near the end of the France game and on Sunday and Monday had a little bit of a headache  so we're being cautious and doing the right things.

'I was off next week anyway, the England guys have a week off and there isn't a game so that was always the plan.

'So we'll see how I am after that, hopefully a bit of sun and a tan will cure it.'

With just six months to go until the World Cup it is a nervous time for any England hopeful but, typical of the man, Brown is adamant the only way to approach the next two months of club rugby is to go hell for leather.

'It can be difficult because it's always in your mind, such a big goal,' Brown said of balancing club and country ambitions.

'I've never played in a World Cup so for me it's everything, it's what I've worked towards.

'And the fact it's in our home country adds a bit extra and we have got a realistic chance of winning the thing because of the way we are playing and the way we have progressed.

'It's hard not to think about but once you're back at your club the games come so thick and fast you leave it in the back of your mind and focus on just giving it your all.'

With five matches to go, Quins are down in eighth place in the table, nine points off an automatic Champions Cup spot and four off a play-off place.

For a side that won the title just three years ago and have finished in the top four in the last two seasons, it has been a campaign of disappointment so far.

But with Brown, England captain Chris Robshaw, club captain Joe Marler and veteran No 8 Nick Easter all back in their ranks from international duty for the final push, they have more than a fighting chance of salvaging it.

Attention switches to club rugby now for Brown as Harlequins look to finish in the top six

Brown says: 'We want to be playing at the top level of European rugby, we want to have those great nights at the Stoop, so we're desperate to try and get that top six spot and we know we can do it.'

Whatever the outcome, next season holds exciting prospects for Harlequins with legendary Lions prop Adam Jones and former Australia captain James Horwill joining their ranks.

Brown enthused: 'Those two guys have played at the highest level, so that sort of experience will be great for us and great for our young guys.

'Jones will be great for our two young tight heads (Kyle) Sinckler and (Will) Collier who are going to turn out to be two world class players.

'I've heard he's a good character off the field as well so to have another guy like that to go with Minty (Easter) and Danny (Care) will be great for the squad and give it a good blend.'

Brown works closely with GB Wheelchair Rugby and backs them as part of the Aviva Community fund, which launched this week. He has donated all of his autumn international man of the series prize money to them in 2013 and also sells his kit viainmylocker.com to raise money for the team.

It is something that is close to his heart, as he explains.

'I got introduced to wheelchair rugby through my future father-in-law, he saw it on the internet and thought it might be something I'd be interested in, knowing the sort of fast-paced sports I like.

'There is a little link with my Dad as well because he's got mild MS and sometimes has to use a wheelchair. It's great to help in any way I can.'
