Sky gazers were treated to a stunning photobomb of Saturn by the moon last night, as the satellite dramatically eclipsed the planet.

In Western Australia, the event could be seen with the naked eye as Saturn disappeared behind the moon and reappeared on the other side.

The event was one of 13 occultations between Saturn and the moon this year. These occur when one astronomical object moves in front of another.

Monday morning's occultation could only be seen by those in the Eastern Hemisphere, but stargazers everywhere were able to experience the event online.

‘It's quite dramatic when [an occultation] involves a bright photogenic object like Saturn, whose rings are now nearly optimally tilted,’ said Slooh astronomer Bob Berman who broadcast the event.

He added there was ‘striking detail visible on the foreground of the moon and the background planet - a true photobomb moment.’

An occulation occurs when once astronomical object moves in front of another.

Lunar occultations are ideal for novice star gazers and suited for small telescopes, as they do not require locating a faint star in the sky. 

It is also possible for one planet to occult another planet. However, these mutual occultations of planets are extremely rare. The last such event occurred on 3 January 1818. 

Last night's event was one of 13 occultations between Saturn and the moon this year.

In the Slooh video, you see two different views of the start of the occultation and three different views of its end.

This line-up was obvious to anyone looked up in Australia, Slooh said, even from light polluted cities and without a telescope.

The event, however, came too near dawn for people in the Western Hemisphere to see it.

Twitter users also released their footage of the ‘photobomb’, using handheld point and shoot cameras, as well as more sophisticated equipment.

By this evening, the moon's appearance in the sky will have glided toward the south to sit above the bright red star Antares.

About a half hour before sunrise on Thursday, Venus will be visible in the low eastern horizon below the constellation Gemini.
