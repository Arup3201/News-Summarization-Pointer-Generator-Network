A hotel guest who witnessed two people drowning in an unsupervised hotel swimming pool thought they were 'joking' as part of an elaborate Murder Mystery weekend, an inquest has heard.

Komba Kpakiwa, 31, and Josephine Foday, 22, were discovered floating in an indoor 10.5-metre swimming pool at Down Hall Country House Hotel in Hatfield Heath on the Essex and Hertfordshire border.

Hotel guest, Marcel Haniff, made the grim discovery shortly after 7.30pm on Saturday, April 27 last year.

Today an inquest held at Chelmsford Coroner's Court heard the pair, who could not swim, had been guests at the hotel and were spotted in difficulties by Mr Haniff who mistakenly thought they were 'joshing about'.

Mr Haniff had arrived at the hotel just hours earlier for a 25th wedding anniversary weekend celebration with his wife and was using the sauna facilities when he heard shouting coming from the neighbouring pool.

He told the court: 'I saw two people in the middle of the pool - between halfway and two thirds down.

'There was a lot of splashing going on.

'The gentleman facing me, I could see his head and shoulders. He was shouting "hey" but it could have been "help".

'The lady, whose back was to me, seemed to jump up and put his head underwater. I regret to say I thought they were just joshing about.

'I only had them in sight for around five seconds. They seemed to be perfectly healthy - just joking and playing.'

The jury heard he later returned to the pool following a short time in the sauna, but despite seeing two bodies floating on the surface he still believed the incident may be all part of an elaborate murder mystery weekend.

He added: 'I started to walk down and immediately saw there were two bodies lying on the surface of the water about two thirds of the way down.

'I thought it was these two fellas messing about. I then realised because it was so still and they were so inert there was something seriously wrong.

'I said something like: "Bloody hell".

'I ran out of the exit towards the reception. I saw a man with a camcorder on the way there and I think, because I had read on the internet they had murder mystery weekends, I told the receptionist "Either someone is playing a big practical joke or a terrible accident has happened.

'"You need to get down there straight away". It was a fairly surreal feeling seeing the scene.'

Ms Foday fled to England with her grandmother from their native Sierra Leone in 2001 when both her parents disappeared in the countryâ€™s civil war.

Mr Kpakiwa, from Erith, Kent, was married with two children. It is understood the pair were in a relationship.

The inquest heard that post mortems were carried out on both victims which gave the same result of deaths 'consistent with drowning'.

Forensic pathologist, Dr Olaf Biedrzycki, who carried out the post-mortem noted a 'heavy vomit contamination' and evidence given to him suggested neither victim could swim - all supporting the drowning conclusion.

Toxicology results showed neither victim had drugs or alcohol in their system at the time of the tragic accident.

The jury was told a police investigation had ruled out any suspicious circumstances and water tests disproved any suggestion chemical levels in the water could have affected the pair.

Health and safety signs had been placed around the pool warning of its maximum depth of 2.1 metres, but vital CCTV footage of the pool had not been working at the time of the incident.

An engineer had been called to fix problems with the CCTV on the morning on the incident - but no temporary measures, such as a lifeguard, were put in place while it was offline.

Caroline Burchall, district environmental health worker for Uttlesford District Council, revealed she had written to the hotel raising 'supervision concerns' and had planned to revisit the site in May last year - just weeks after the incident occurred.

She told the inquest: 'If you're going to not provide supervision, you need to carry out a risk assessment to show what provisions you will have to justify not having a lifeguard in place.

'I had understood there was supervision of the CCTV screens which was not the case.'

Mrs Burchall went on to explain the design of the 'hopper pool' meant the deep end sloped into the centre of the pool at a maximum depth of 2.1 metres.

This afternoon one former hotel guest told the court how he had warned hotel bosses about the slope in the pool a year before the tragic deaths.

Leonard Tabner, 67, a landscape painter from North Yorkshire, told bosses: 'If something is not done, I can see someone drowning in that swimming pool.'

Mr Tabner explained how he had 'almost drowned' in the pool when he walked from the shallow end towards the deep end during a morning swim in April 2012.

He said: 'The floor of the swimming pool seemed to fall away and I lost my footing. The slope was too steep and I was out of my depth.

'I almost drowned - I was very alarmed and was in a state of shock.I got out and asked to speak to a manager.

'In an ideal world I would have followed up with a letter but I had other things on my mind.'I regret that now, obviously.'

The inquest also heard evidence from receptionist Lucy Whiffen, who was working on the front desk at the hotel at the time of the tragic deaths.

She admitted failing to sign in Mr Kpawika and Miss Foday to the pool despite it being part of hotel guidelines - something she said happened around 40 per cent of the time if she was busy and guests were impatient.

When questioned, she told the court: 'The only reason I can think is I was busy doing something at the back.'

Recounting the moment she first learnt of the tragic incident, she added: 'Mr Haniff came to the desk and said two people were either messing around or dead.

'They were the word he used.'

Widow Gurpeet Kpakiwa sat silently as she heard harrowing evidence about the death of her husband at Chelmsford Coroner's Court today, although no family were present for Miss Foday.

The jury were told Down Hall Country House Hotel is a large hotel set in 110 acres of woodland.

The luxurious hotel offers guests a 10.5-metre swimming pool, sauna and jacuzzi. The inquest, which is expected to last three days, continues.
