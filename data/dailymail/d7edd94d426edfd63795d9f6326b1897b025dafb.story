Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson has risked an FA charge after an astonishing blast at ‘arrogant’ referee Mike Dean.

Pearson was furious that Tottenham were awarded a contentious second-half penalty after David Nugent and Danny Rose collided in the area.

And the Foxes boss let rip at the official after the final whistle, branding Dean ‘arrogant’.

Nigel Pearson was incensed by Mike Dean's decision to award a penalty and labelled him 'arrogrant'

Pearson said: ‘Will I speak to the referee? What’s the point? What is the point of talking to him? He is one of the most arrogant men I have ever met. There we are.

‘The arrogance of the man at times is frightening. I just find it difficult to accept that we have to deal with yet another contentious decision that has not gone our way.

The ref gave the controversial penalty after David Nugent was adjudged to have brought down Danny Rose

‘It is two players colliding. Nugent will be the first to admit he should have probably dealt with it a little

bit earlier. The length of time it took to actually give the decision, and I am led to believe nobody else’s opinion was actually involved.

‘He took that length of time to decide if two players colliding in the box is a penalty. I really do feel at the moment that we continue to be short-changed. I am not suggesting that it is deliberate but we can’t be on the receiving end of so many poor decisions.’

On the prospect of an FA fine, Pearson added: ‘Will the FA look at it? I don’t know. Will they?’

Pearson's side were unlucky to not come away with a point after pushing Tottenham all the way
