A police officer was caught on camera repeatedly punching a man who is lying face down on the ground and not resisting, in the latest footage of apparent brutality by American police.

The video, captured by a bystander, shows the police officer pounding the victim at least five times around the head as a terrified witness asks why the attack was necessary.

The victim, whose name is not known, was not arrested after the attack, which took place outside a nightclub in Columbia, the state capital of South Carolina.

But Columbia Police Investigator Tyrone Pugh has been suspended without pay pending the outcome of internal investigations after the video went viral on Instagram, reports South Carolina paper The State.

The 15-second video of the attack on the early hours of Sunday morning shows Pugh repeatedly battering the man in a car park outside a nightclub.

It shows the policeman kneeling on top of the man, who is on the ground and on his side, beating him and shouting: 'Stay on the ground! Stay on the ground!'

Robyn Hogg, 19, who filmed the incident on her mobile phone and can be heard shouting at the officer in the footage, told The State that the victim had been standing close to where a scuffle had broken out.

The officer grabbed him, threw him to the ground and started punching him, she said.

'He said, "I didn’t do anything." He wasn’t resisting. I think it was unnecessary. Two other cops there were aggressive but not like that,' Miss Hogg said.

Miss Hogg said the incident occurred when a fight broke out after a party of about 300 people at the Columbia Soundstage to celebrate her upcoming 20th birthday.

Pugh was one of five uniformed Columbia police officers working off-duty at the venue. Two 23-year-old men were arrested and charged with fighting, although the man hit by Pugh was not.

The incident comes amid outrage in the U.S. at apparent police brutality, which has seen the deaths of a number of people at the hands of officers who are able to act with apparent impunity.

Protests spread across the nation following the shooting death of Michael Brown, a young unarmed black man, at the hands of a white police officer last August.

On July 17, 2014, Eric Garner died in Staten Island, New York, after a police officer put him in a chokehold - a restraint banned by the New York Police Department.

The police shootings of unarmed Akai Gurley in New York City and Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old with a toy gun, in Cleveland, Ohio, also contributed to a widespread and growing animosity towards police in the U.S. in the past year.

Columbia police confirmed that Pugh and the other man involved in the incident were both African American.

Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin told The State: '(The video) left me gravely concerned as to what the possible circumstances might have been, and I shared that with the chief and he acted accordingly.'
