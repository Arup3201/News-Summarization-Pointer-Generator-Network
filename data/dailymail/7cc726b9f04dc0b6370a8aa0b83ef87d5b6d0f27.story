Trendsetter: Jeremy Paxman has been blamed for a beard trend that has brought a slump in sales of shaving gels, it has been claimed

Jeremy Paxman has been blamed for a beard trend that has brought a slump in sales of shaving gels, it has been claimed.

Will King, the chief executive of King of Shaves, said last year’s craze for beards among stars including the Newsnight presenter and Hollywood actor George Clooney, had damaged the men’s toiletries industry.

He believes that many followed Paxman and Clooney by growing facial hair, starting a ‘beard phase’ that has adversely affected the whole men’s shaving sector.

The British entrepreneur, who launched his shaving products business in 1993, said: ‘Sales across the shaving industry were actually down in the UK and US last year for the first time because of guys not shaving, because of the celebrity beard, and partly because of the recession.’ 

‘[The downturn] took five years from the start of the recession, and maybe it has been spurred on by the whole internet entrepreneur look, the “I work in Shoreditch, I don’t need to shave” look,’ he told the Sunday Telegraph.

Paxman caused a media storm on August 12 when he returned to work on Newsnight after his summer break with a beard.

Twitter was deluged with opinions both for and against his salt and pepper bristles, while commentators debated the pros and cons of facial hair.

The 63-year-old presenter was invited onto the BBC’s Today programme to contribute to the debate, but declined.

Paxman said that he was bemused by the reaction. He wrote: ‘I had not seen it coming. The thing is I don’t normally like beards. A shave makes a clean start to the day. But it is also a waste of time.

'At a rough guess I calculate that all those five minutes every morning have devoured months of my life.’ 

When the presenter returned to work earlier this month after a Christmas break he had shaved his beard off.

In an interview with Radio Times he said: ‘If a chap can’t shave on holiday, what can he do? Beards are so 2013.’
