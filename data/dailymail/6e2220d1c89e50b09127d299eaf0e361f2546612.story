A drunk man shot his best friend before chopping off the victim's penis and feeding it to his dog because he had been touched 'sexually'.

Mario Alberto Lizalde Reyes, 25, had been walking his dog with lifelong friend Mario Hernandez Banda, 24, when the two men started arguing. 

Reyes said that Banda had tried to touch him 'in a sexual way' in the neighbourhood of Parajes de San Isidro, in the city of Ciudad Juarez, in the north-central Mexican state of Chihuahua.

In a televised confession, Reyes said: 'We were both drunk and he tried touching me in a sexual way.

'After pushing him off, he went to urinate in an alley so I followed him, pulled out my gun and shot him in the head.

'I then took his knife off him and chopped off his penis as punishment and put it in a bag.

'But my dog was next to me and was sniffing at it so I decided to give it to him and he ate it.' 

A police spokesman said Reyes came into the police station covered in cuts and bruises and said he had fought with his stepfather when he told him what he had done

Leaving the bloody body slumped in the alley, Reyes then casually finished walking his dog before going home to sleep off the booze.

But the next day he felt so guilty about what he had done, he decided to hand himself in.

A police spokesman said: 'He came in covered in cuts and bruises and said he had fought with his stepfather when he told him what he had done.

'He then admitting killing his best friend and said that although his friend had tried sexually assaulting him, he was still a human being and didn't deserve to die.'

He now faces life in jail.

It comes as a cruel aunt faces jail after she cut off her three-year-old nephew's penis because he burst in on her in the loo and asked to use her phone.

Xue Paan, 37, attacked her nephew Qiang Qiang as she was supposed to be looking after him while his mother went to visit a neighbour in Luohe, a city in Henan Province, central China.

Xue was sitting on the toilet sending text messages to her boyfriend when the toddler walked in and asked if he could play a game on her mobile phone.

Instead of giving him the phone, the aunt went into the kitchen, picked up a knife, then came back and sliced off the boy's penis.
