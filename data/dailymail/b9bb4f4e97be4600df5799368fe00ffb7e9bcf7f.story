Vivienne Westwood has paid tribute to Prince Charles and 'the great job he is doing' by featuring him in her latest menswear collection.

The world-renowned fashion designer has given a nod to the royal in her AW15 collection by printing the Prince of Wales' face on several pieces of clothing.

Guests at the designer's show in Milan yesterday, which came as part of the Italian city's Menswear Fashion Week, were first to witness the unveiling of several items paying homage to the royal.

An image of Prince Charles, wearing an Army beret, featured heavily in the show – and British-born Westwood told guests she had 'adopted Prince Charles as patron of the collection'.

Describing the royal as an 'eco warrior', the 73-year-old said: 'I want to pay tribute to Prince Charles and the great job he's doing.

'If Prince Charles had ruled the world according to his priorities during the last 30 years, we would be all right and we would be tackling climate change.'

She also described how the Prince of Wales has helped raise awareness of organic farming and climate change over the years.

The ardent environmental campaigner even wore an oversized T-shirt bearing an image of the prince's face as she walked down the catwalk with her husband Andreas Kronthaler, who is 25 years her junior.

As well as featuring the prince's image in her collection, Westwood also gave a nod to his sense of style by featuring tailored suits, tweed and belted houndstooth checked coats in her collection.

It wasn't just Prince Charles who got a mention though, the Queen also featured, with sterling notes featuring the monarch's face printed on handbags and accessories.

Westwood's relationship with the royals goes back decades, and she famously wore silver horns and no underwear to Buckingham Palace when she collected her OBE in 1996.

The outspoken designer, who was born Vivienne Swire in rural Derbyshire in 1941, has carved out a remarkable career after building up her clothing emporium and brand name.

Her zest for life and for ideas has moved her more and more into political activism, and she is now on the board of Liberty, the human rights organisation, and is a Greenpeace spokesperson.

She donates nearly all her money to saving the rainforests and the Arctic circle, living simply with husband Andreas, whom she met when she was teaching fashion.

Her eclectic group of friends, activists and confrères range from Pamela Anderson to Prince Charles, Shami Chakrabati, Naomi Campbell, Jerry Hall, Bob Geldof and Julian Assange.
