A conservative Mississippi blogger who is accused of photographing the bedridden 72-year-old wife of Republican U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran, 76, without permission has had bail set at $100,000.

Clayton Kelly, 28, has a preliminary hearing on Thursday, which was scheduled by a magistrate in Mississippi on Sunday, Assistant Police Chief Robert Sanders said.

Police were also looking into the possibility that other people were involved.

'That is certainly one of the focal points of the investigation,' Sanders said in an email.

Kelly was arrested Friday on a charge of exploiting a vulnerable adult. He's accused of using an image of Cochran's wife, Rose, who suffers from dementia and has been in a nursing home since 2000, in an online video.

State Sen. Chris McDaniel, who is challenging the six-term senator in a GOP primary in June, said he does not have any ties to Kelly.

'I've reached out to Senator Cochran directly to express my abhorrence for the reprehensible actions of this individual,' McDaniel said in a statement Saturday. 'This criminal act is deeply offensive and my team and I categorically reject such appalling behavior.'

Kelly voluntarily took down the video about 90 minutes after uploading it last month and is cooperating with investigators, said his attorney, Kevin Camp.

Cochran's attorney Don Clark said on Saturday that the photo of Rose Cochran was taken near her bedside. Kelly's attorney said it was taken through an open door during visiting hours.

'He didn't do anything that was out of the norms of visitation. He took the photo and put it on the blog,' Camp said.

Kelly's Facebook page includes a photo of a McDaniel campaign sign and a photo of him with McDaniel at a campaign meet-and-greet event.

On his blog, Constitutional Clayton, Kelly wrote: 'When it comes to Republicans with a bad voting record, you can't get any worse than Thad Cochran.'

Since Kelly's arrest, the campaigns have traded barbs over when Kelly came to the attention of the McDaniel campaign.

Cochran's campaign released a voicemail it received from McDaniel's campaign manager, trying to show that McDaniel's camp knew about Kelly before his arrest.

The recording was first reported by The Clarion-Ledger and later provided to The Associated Press.

Cochran was elected to Senate in 1978 after six years in the House. He is a former chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

'I have been fortunate to have a wonderful family, and like so many families, we are deeply affected by my wife's serious, long-term illness, that we consider to be a very private family matter,' Cochran said in a statement Saturday. 'We will continue doing everything we can to protect my wife's safety and security.'
