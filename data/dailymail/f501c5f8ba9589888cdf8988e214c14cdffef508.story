Road safety campaigners have criticised two drivers after one was filmed apparently asleep at the wheel while another was pictured driving with a burger in one hand and a drink in the other.

Police are trying to identify the van driver who was filmed while appearing to be asleep at the wheel in a video which was posted on Facebook.

The 12-second clip shows him sitting back with his eyes closed and arms folded as the van travels at speed.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Police are also investigating this motorist for driving while holding a burger in one hand and a drink in the other

A passenger can be seen holding the steering wheel with one hand as cars drive past on the opposite carriageway.

Another motorist meanwhile has also been criticised after he was pictured driving while holding a burger in one hand and a cold drink in the other.

An image of the driver travelling at speed - with neither hand on the wheel - was posted on to Facebook.

The footage of the apparently sleeping driver - captioned 'I don't drive but I'm pretty certain this isn't legal or safe' - was also uploaded to the site, on Monday.

The prank has been condemned by road safety campaigners.

Speaking about the apparently sleeping driver, Neil Greig, of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: 'This is of course illegal and is simply asking for trouble - both on the road and from the police who will also see this video.

The footage - captioned 'I don't drive but I'm pretty certain this isn't legal or safe' - was uploaded to Facebook on Monday

'The selfishness of these people 
astounds me - how could they live with themselves if they killed an 
innocent passerby, just for the sake of trending on social media for a 
few hours?'

A spokeswoman 
for road safety charity Brake said: 'Falling asleep at the wheel is no 
joking matter - at least 300 people die on our roads every year as a 
result of tired driving, tearing apart families and communities across 
the country.

'Drivers who 
fail to stop when they're tired, or mess about at the wheel and don't 
pay attention, are gambling with the lives of everyone on the road.'

The footage of the driver who appears to be asleep was posted by a user from Carluke, South Lanarkshire, but it is unclear when or where it was taken.

A
 spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: 'This type of behaviour not only 
puts these individuals at risk but also other road users.

'Whether it is a prank or not what they are doing is extremely dangerous.

'I would appeal for anyone who can identify them to contact police.'

A 12-second clip of the driver, which shows him sitting back with his eyes closed and arms folded, has been posted on Facebook

The
 picture of the driver eating a burger meanwhile shows him in his Peugeot car, drinking 
juice through a straw and holding a half-eaten McDonald's burger in his 
other hand.

One person who saw the picture on the site commented: 'Now that's what I call multi-tasking. HaHaHa.'

But stunned campaigners branded the man's actions 'shocking'.

Mr
 Greig, of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: 'There is no way 
you can be in proper control of a vehicle with a burger in one hand a 
drink in the other - that is just plain stupidity.'

A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: 'The photograph has been passed on to the relevant department for further inquiry.

'Inquiries are ongoing and officers are following a possible line of inquiry.'
