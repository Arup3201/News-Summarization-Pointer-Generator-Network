A man has denied multiple charges of rape at Derby Crown Court (pictured) claiming he has a growth on his penis and it hurts to have sex

Defending himself at Derby Crown Court yesterday, Khatkar said he had a growth on his genitals which became painful when he had sex.

Khatkar was examined by a police surgeon after his arrest and no medical injuries were recorded.

But he told the jury that a more detailed examination would have been needed to see the growth.

Khatkar said he had requested that the doctor look at the growth but the police had claimed it was irrelevant and unnecessary.

His Lawyer Tim Spencer QC told the court: 'The prosecution say your account is nonsense, rubbish, and you are a rapist, a molester, an attacker of women, in a determined way, particularly in the relatively few hours on February 1 and 2.'

Khatkar replied: 'That’s not true at all.'

Khatkar claims he was had been set up by the alleged victim of the December 2011 attack who was out for revenge after a jury found him not guilty of raping and sexually assaulting her at an earlier trial.

He claims that woman was working with three men, one of whom had accused him of stealing drugs.

He said he was taken to a house in Derby where he had been assaulted and questioned about the missing drugs before his alleged victims were instructed to sexually assault him.

He also said that some drugs, belonging to one of the men whom he claims had set him up, had gone missing from the woman’s home at the time and he was being blamed.

Khatkar said he was taken to a house where he was assaulted and questioned about the missing drugs by some men and three women, his alleged victims, were instructed to sexually assault him.

Khatkar, 37, of Sinfin, Derby, denies all the charges against him. He is due to be cross-examined next week.
