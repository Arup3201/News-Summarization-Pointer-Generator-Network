The US military has successfully tested a .50-caliber sniper round that can change direction on its way to its target.

And now the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) has released a video of this Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance (Exacto) program in action.

The footage shows the bullet changing direction in mid-air in response to a target's movements.

Once fired, actuators inside the guided bullet receive data from an optical sensor to guide it to the correct location. Small fins are used to change the bullet's trajectory, and the bullet can correct its movements 30 times a second. This grab shows the path, original aim point, and the moving target (green) 

According to Darpa: 'For military snipers, acquiring moving targets in unfavourable conditions, such as high winds and dusty terrain commonly found in Afghanistan, is extremely challenging with current technology.

'It is critical that snipers be able to engage targets faster, and with better accuracy, since any shot that doesn’t hit a target also risks the safety of troops by indicating their presence and potentially exposing their location.'

A video from the Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance (Exacto) program shows a bullet changing its direction.

DARPA has not released precise details of how its bullet moves in mid-air, but this is one way in which the technology could work. 

Each self-guided bullet is four inches (10 cm) long. 

A sniper working at extreme range shines a laser onto the target. 

An optical sensor on the bullet detects the light from the laser to identify where the target is. 

Once fired, actuators inside the bullet receive data from the optical sensor to guide it to the correct location. 

Small fins are used to change the bullet's trajectory, and the bullet can correct its movements 30 times a second.

These changes are in response to movements of the laser, which the sniper uses to continually track and light up the target.

The sniper additionally has to take into account wind, distance and even the curvature of the Earth, before pulling the trigger. 

Darpa claims the new system is the first ever guided small caliber bullet.

'The Exacto .50-caliber round and optical sighting technology expects to greatly extend the day and night time range over current state-of-the-art sniper systems,' continued the agency.

'The system combines a manoeuverable bullet and a real-time guidance system to track and deliver the projectile to the target, allowing the bullet to change path during flight to compensate for any unexpected factors that may drive it off course.

'Technology development in Phase II included the design, integration and demonstration of aero-actuation controls, power sources, optical guidance systems, and sensors. 

'The program’s next phase includes a system-level live-fire test and technology refinement to enhance and improve performance.'

The current world record for the longest certified kill was by Corporal Craig Harrison of the UK Household Cavalry, who killed two Taliban in November 2009 from 1.54 miles (22.4km). 

The shot was approximately 3,000ft (914 metres) beyond the stated maximum range of the Accuracy L115A3 sniper rifle, used by Corporal Harrison. 

The Taliban were so far away it took each round almost three seconds to reach its target.

Snipers typically work in two-man teams with a spotter assisting the gunman identifying targets as well as providing security.

But environmental details such as wind, rain and even humidity can affect the flight path of a bullet. 

This graphic reveals how the Exacto bullet tracks its target and changes directions. The sniper additionally has to take into account wind, distance and even the curvature of the Earth, before pulling the trigger. DARPA has not released precise details of how its bullet moves in mid-air, but this is one way in which the technology could work.

A sniper begins by shining a laser onto the target. An optical sensor on the 4-inch (10cm) Exacto bullet (illustrated) detects the laser to identify where the target is. As the bullet moves through the air, it responds to changes in the movement of the laser, which the sniper uses to continually track and light up the target

Also bullets have to counter gravity and droop down over longer distances. 

Under the new system, a sniper will be able to adjust the bullet's direction mid-flight in case a target moved or the bullet shifted due to a gust of wind.

The newly released video shows two tests filmed earlier this year. In the both tests the round is fired deliberately off target but turns in mid-air. 

In the second target, the round it its intended target despite being fired several feet to the left.

Ted Catchel, professor emeritus at the Naval War College said the system is a very interesting development. 

He told Stars and Stripes: 'I don’t know if you push a button and it takes over. I just couldn’t find out enough about the system to know how it works.

'You still need to train these snipers in the traditional methods. Right now, sniping is a real precise art.'

Many snipers use .50 caliber bullets, similar to the ones pictured, because their weight causes significant damage. Snipers typically work in two-man teams with a spotter assisting the gunman identifying targets as well as providing security. The wind, rain and even humidity can affect the flight path of a bullet
