Walk past Ray and Michele Blundell’s home near Lichfield in Staffordshire, and you might think you had stepped back 450 years.

It is in the classic, half-timbered, Elizabethan style - built on an oak frame, with an ancient tiled roof, and the first floor teetering over the ground floor.

In fact, the cottage is only 14 years old. What’s more, the Blundells built the whole thing from scratch, teaching themselves plumbing, electrical wiring and medieval carpentry into the bargain. 

Oh, and they also carved a majestic garden out of a dreary third-of-an-acre plot, which had only three plum trees and a lawn when they bought it. And all for only £200,000.

Thanks to their efforts, it’s worth more than £600,000. But they’re not selling.

‘We’d both come out of divorces and had no money,’ says Ray, 69, about their 1998 decision.

Ray was a sales director while Michele, 48, worked at a children’s nursery as they built the house. ‘We were looking for something to renovate. But, because everything was grade II-listed, we couldn’t make the changes we wanted. So we decided to build it instead.

‘I always liked drinking in old English pubs, with inglenook fireplaces,’ Ray says, ‘and oak is so tactile.’ In fact, Ray has since built another two - and sold them on - just down the road. But, to begin with, he and Michele were pretty much in the dark.

After the Blundells bought the land for £90,000, they spent the next two-and-a-half years in a static caravan on the site, as their dream took shape. 

Building costs came to a total of £110,000. They bought the oak frame from a company in Herefordshire. ‘At first,’ says Ray, ‘the bank refused to give us money. They saw this pile of sticks in the yard, and thought we could never build a house out of them.

‘The man from the bank came back three weeks later, after the frame had been assembled, and was gobsmacked.’

Three builders put together the 20-ton frame on site but, after that, the Blundells were left with little more than a skeleton, open to the skies.

First, they had to put a roof on. ‘I belong to a running club and, one day, I ran past a big house near Sutton Coldfield, where they were re-tiling the roof,’ says Ray, ‘The tiles he was taking down were better than the ones he was putting up! So I did a deal and bought 15,000 tiles. I borrowed a trailer from work to deliver them home.’

Hands-on experience: A sledgehammer-wielding Michele Blundell works on the roof during the construction phase in 1999

Ray taught himself how to tile a roof and to fill the panels between the timber framing. In Elizabethan times, those panels were built out of wattle and daub; nowadays, builders use a special insulation membrane that expands to fill any gaps as the oak dries.

The joinery techniques Ray used are largely the same as they were in the 16th century.

The box-like shape of the rooms is also typical of Elizabethan houses. The dimensions are still dictated by the height of the oak trees, as they were 450 years ago. And, just like Elizabethan houses, their cottage moved as the oak dried and shrank.

‘There were little gaps in the wall where the oak shrank,’ explains Ray. ‘You could see daylight through them — it was like seeing the sun through the stones at Stonehenge! But now we’ve filled the gaps and the house has stopped drying and shrinking.’ 

Having spent £200,000 on building the property, it is now worth in excess of £600,000. Mr Blundell has since built another two - and sold them on - just down the road

The Blundells have more dreams that they want to turn into reality. The next scheme is a new greenhouse - oak-framed, of course

The Blundells haven’t finished yet, though. 

Lying in their front drive are 80 oak posts, which they are going to turn into a new wing. They’ve already bought an 18th- century monk’s bench to go inside. 

The extension will be based on the porch at Great Dixter - the 15th-century house in Sussex remodelled by Sir Edwin Lutyens, in 1912. It was later lived in by the late gardening writer Christopher Lloyd.

The Blundells are impressive gardeners, too. That bare third of an acre has now been turned into a paradise of winding paths, classical urns, and borders crammed with dogwood trees and more than 100 Japanese maples. 

In one corner, there’s a stately pond, dug out with the same JCB that laid the foundations of the house.

And the Blundells still want to turn their dreams into reality. The next scheme is a new greenhouse — oak-framed, of course.
