Police forces across the country have signed up to a new voluntary code of conduct that will place limits on the stop and search powers used by officers.

Home Secretary Theresa May has said the powers were being misused, which she warned could be 'hugely damaging to the relationship between the police and the public.'

All 43 police forces in England and Wales have now agreed to sign up to the scheme, which places limits on the use of controversial 'Section 60' stops.

The changes have been brought in after Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) found that 27 per cent of stop and searches did not contain reasonable grounds for suspicion, meaning more than 250,000 of the one million searches conducted last year could have been illegal.

In addition, black and minority ethnic (BME) members of the public were up to six times more likely to be searched than white people.

Forces signed up to the scheme will agree to more limits on blanket Section 60 stops, which allow officers to stop people on the anticipation of serious violence without suspicion a person is carrying weapons, while better records will be kept of each instance and published online.

The Metropolitan Police Service, the UK's biggest police force, which employs more than 31,000 officers, has signed up to the scheme and said it was introducing those two elements of the new plan from today.

It comes after Section 60 searches were used as a tactic in combating violent crime at this year's Notting Hill Carnival.

Last year 47,141 arrests were made as a result of stop and search, representing 20 per cent of total arrests by the Met, and of the 251,161 people who were stopped and searched from August 2013 to July 2014, 115,270 (46 per cent) were white, 72,016 (29 per cent) were black and 34,267 (14 per cent) were Asian. Men accounted for 94% of all searches.

Home Secretary Theresa May has said the powers were being misused, which she warned could be 'hugely damaging to the relationship between the police and the public' 

Speaking in the House of Commons when announcing the shake-up in April, Mrs May said misuse of the power damaged public trust in the police.

She said: 'While it is undoubtedly an important police power, when it is misused stop and search can be counter-productive.

'First, it can be an enormous waste of police time. Second, when innocent people are stopped and searched for no good reason, it is hugely damaging to the relationship between the police and the public. In those circumstances it is an unacceptable affront to justice.'

Commander Adrian Hanstock, the Met's lead for stop and search, said: 'The Best Use Stop and Search scheme supports the Met's ongoing drive to make stop and search more intelligence-led and effective.

'The Met has made significant improvements to stop and search over the last two years to not only reduce the total number of people we search, but also to ensure that our officers focus on those areas and types of crime that the public are most concerned about.

'As a result, we are arresting more people than ever before following the more targeted use of stop and search and routinely find people in possession of weapons and stolen items.

'In line with the Best Use of Stop and Search scheme and our commitment to increase transparency and accountability, the MPS has today introduced a new approach to Section 60 authorisation and has introduced revised recording of stop and search outcomes.

'We recognise the impact stop and search can have on individuals and communities. Our work with communities and monitoring groups is helping to ensure we are more transparent than ever in how stop and search helps to reduce crime and keep people safe, but we of course recognise there is much more to do to improve confidence across all communities in the use of the powers.'
