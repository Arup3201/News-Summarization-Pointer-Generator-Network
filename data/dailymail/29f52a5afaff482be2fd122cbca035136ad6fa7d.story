Michael Jackson blaring from pitch-side speakers in training and a committee created for players to moan. The world of Ian Holloway is still weird and wonderful.

The sense of wonder spread to his press conference on Saturday when, unprompted, he took the admirable step, albeit a risky one, of criticising his own fans for their deplorable Jimmy Savile chants during the 2-0 win over Leeds.

‘Until we make a stand the world ain’t right,’ he said. ‘How often do we turn a blind eye to things?’ It was spoken with passion and anger, a hand slapping the table and eyes darting around the room. 

In charge: Ian Holloway shouts instructions to his Millwall players during  their 2-0 win against Leeds

With any luck, those supporters will react the right way, because their club is enriched by this emotional man of a thousand tangents, just as he is by the club.

What better surroundings than Millwall for a manager who sometimes likes to feel he is fighting the world?

It’s that attitude that appears to have made men of little boys, a group that Holloway says ‘were all good at making excuses’ when he arrived in January and they were 21st in the Championship. They finished last season with an eight-game unbeaten run and have started the new one with passing football and a hammering for a club in need of its own inspiration.

His methods, revealed by Millwall defender Mark Beevers at the weekend, are wacky yet chime completely with what you might expect.

‘Every manager has a different way of doing things and this time it’s started off pretty well,’ said Beevers, who had scored Millwall’s opening goal and recently became a father.

‘The oddest thing he’s done was when he first came in. We had a training session with speakers around the pitch and ended up doing training drills to Michael Jackson at full blast. It was Billie Jean, wasn’t it gaffer?’

By this point, Holloway had entered the room and was seated at the back.

Holloway: ‘Are you telling these people? That’s private!’

Beevers: ‘It’s not — not anymore.’

Holloway: ‘It didn’t work though because nobody enjoyed it. Doesn’t he look more mature now he’s a father?’

Beevers: ‘I’ve always looked mature.’

On it went. Another day in the Holloway house. The manager would later lose his cool in discussing the behaviour of his fans, an answer which came in response to a gentle opening question about his side’s perfect start to their season.

There was also a rant about a penalty not given and the actions of West Yorkshire Police, who he believes have not shown Millwall fans respect when travelling to Leeds in the past. There were contradictions and all manner of digressions.

At one stage, he explained himself by saying: ‘I am doing a lot of talking because I have had a long summer.’

Holloway works himself up and then calms himself down. Same as always. He is emotional but utterly decent, and also a fine manager who has evolved over 18 seasons and is not afraid to try new things.

His solution to last season’s in-house moaning has been to create a complaints committee, enabling senior professionals to raise issues from the squad.

‘I’m not involved’, said Beevers, 24. ‘It’s more the older generation, your Fordies (David Forde) and Chappers (Richard Chaplow) who have more experience in the game.

‘Anything you need, you go to them and they go to the manager. He’s got it more organised. He has a certain way of doing things and he’s installed that into us from day one on and off the pitch. We got our rewards for it here.’

Some bookies make Millwall second favourites to go down. Holloway loudly mocked those suggestions in his dressing room after this match.

A win over Leeds is no great indicator these days, so it remains to be seen how they face the challenge.

One thing that is certain is Holloway will not stop talking — to do that he says ‘you’d have to lock me in a cage, in a bag’. Who would?

PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND

Mick McCarthy told me last week that ‘if money was everything in football I wouldn’t bother’.

How interesting, then, to see McCarthy’s Ipswich beat Fulham 2-1 at Portman Road. Ipswich choose not to pay transfer fees and Fulham recently spent £11m on Ross McCormack, who came off after 57 minutes.

WHAT’S CAUGHT MY EYE... 

Leeds owner Massimo Cellino was everywhere on Saturday. Smoking in the car park before kick-off, then in the dugout talking to manager Dave Hockaday before chatting with Millwall’s groundsman. He was silent in the dressing room afterwards.

Matej Vydra and Troy Deeney have picked up where they left off. They netted a combined 44 goals two seasons ago before Vydra’s season at West Brom. Reunited, they each scored in the 3-0 win over Bolton.

Eddie Howe was described by Bournemouth’s chairman as the country’s best young boss and he has been backed financially. Over £2million was spent on Callum Wilson — and he scored twice on his debut at Huddersfield.
