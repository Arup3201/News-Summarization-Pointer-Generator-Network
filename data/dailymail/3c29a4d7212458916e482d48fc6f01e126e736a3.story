With the World Cup over and the new Premier League season looming on the horizon, many of Manchester City's stars have returned to pre-season training.

Those who turned out in Brazil - such as the trio of Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta and Martin Demichelis who all made it to the final with Argentina - are still on holiday, but the rest are back from summer vacation as preparations begin for their title defence.

Among those back are Samir Nasri and Alvaro Negredo - who were shunned from the squad's of France and Spain respectively - as well as the likes of Javi Garcia, Jesus Navas and Gael Clichy.

Stevan Jovetic and Micah Richards were also among the other first-team players involved in the session at St Andrews as City prepare for Friday's friendly with Hearts.

Manuel Pellegrini and his squad are spending the week training at St Andrews in Scotland before their second pre-season game.

Also in training action was new signing Fernando, who joined from Porto in a Â£12m deal last month.

And he will be hoping to get off to the best possible start at the club, as he looks to make an impact in the Premier League after seven seasons in Portugal.

'It is a dream to be here and to be part of this great club,' he told the club website after he made the move. 'I also hope to become one of the club's great players.'

Fernando and fellow new man Willy Caballero both featured as Man City lost 2-0 to Dundee in their first pre-season game on Sunday.
