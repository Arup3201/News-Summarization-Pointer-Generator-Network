Two 20-foot-deep disposal pits opened in western South Dakota on Monday to help ranchers dispose of tens of thousands of cattle carcasses littering the countryside since an early October blizzard decimated herds.

Up to 4 feet of snow fell in the Black Hills area during the storm, killing at least 10,000 to 20,000 head of livestock, state officials say. The South Dakota Stockgrowers Association estimates this part of the state lost at least 5 percent of its cattle, which is mostly raised for beef.

Ranchers are encouraged to bring carcasses to the sites in Pennington County, which were built to state Animal Industry Board guidelines, in an effort to prevent the contamination of waterways that can come from home burials.

Decimated: Cattle stocks were decimated in western South Dakota last week as a freak blizzard took ranchers by surprise, killed tens of thousands of heads

'Some people might decide to bury their losses right where they are,' Alexa White, public information officer with the county's Emergency Operations Center said Monday.

The
number of dead cattle will likely rise as more losses are documented. 
Last week's rain added moisture to pastures already saturated by the 
quickly melting snow, making it difficult for ranchers to traverse the 
vast terrain to assess losses and tend to stressed but surviving 
animals, said Silvia Christen, executive director of the Stockgrowers 
Association.

'The 
priority right now is taking care of the livestock that made it through 
the storm,' Christen said. 'Once it dries up, ranchers will focus on the
disposal.'

Another 
snowstorm heading into the Black Hills on Monday was expected to bring 
up to a foot of snow, threatening to complicate the soggy mess.

Dead where they stood: As many as 20,000 cattle are thought to have died where they stood. Now the state has dug two 20-foot pits for their disposal

Dangerous: Tens of thousands of cattle still litter the South Dakota countryside and officials are pushing for proper disposal instead of home burials that can contaminate water

Animal Industry Board rules require 
carcasses to be burned, buried to a depth of 4 feet or disposed of by a 
licensed rendering plant within 36 hours of death, though South Dakota 
Gov. Dennis Daugaard has waived the standard timeframe, recognizing the 
difficulty in meeting that deadline.

The
burial sites are located in the eastern part of Pennington County with 
access to Interstate 90, but that could be a 100-mile-plus drive for a 
rancher raising cattle in Buffalo County.

'They want to make sure they're not in streams and stuff, because they can contaminate the water,' Kantack said.

The
pits are dug specifically to avoid such health problems, as burial 
sites must be at least 1,000 feet from surface water, floodplains, 
rivers or private or public drinking water wells.

Burial
is also prohibited when the primary subsurface material 20 feet below 
the bottom of the pit is primarily sand or gravel or when the depth to 
an aquifer is less than 20 feet from the bottom of the pit.

Black
and bloated carcasses of cows still lie rotting in the thousands in 
scenes more akin to an apocalyptic nightmare than the aftermath of a 
snowstorm.

But with no federal livestock disaster program in place, many ranchers were left wondering how they would survive the setback.

'This is the worse than I've ever seen for loss of livestock,' said rancher Karl Knutson, 25, who works on his family ranch east of the town of Sturgis, as he began counting his losses.

'Some people were very well prepared and lost 50 per cent of their herd,' said state veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven told CNN. 'Some were not prepared and took no losses. There was no rhyme or reason to it. Some ranchers lost everything.'

'It will be two weeks to a month before we have a better idea of the impact,' he added.

Gary Cammack, who ranches on the prairie near Union Center about 40 miles northeast of the Black Hills, said he lost about 70 cows and some calves, about 15 percent of his herd. A calf would normally sell for $1,000, while a mature cow would bring $1,500 or more, he said.

'It’s bad. It’s really bad. I’m the eternal optimist and this is really bad,' Cammack, 60, said. 'The livestock loss is just catastrophic. ... It’s pretty unbelievable.'

On top of the vast swathes of cattle killed in the blizzard, many also wandered off as powerful winds blew them far from their home pastures.
