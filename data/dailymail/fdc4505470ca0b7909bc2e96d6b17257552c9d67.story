Picture the scene. A small, visibly distressed girl asks to speak to her teacher the day after she returns from a holiday in Somalia.

The teacher listens as the girl explains what has happened to her: her clitoris removed, her legs bound together. Terrible pain, no anaesthetic.

Her teacher's shocking response: 'That's nice dear. A bit like a Bar Mitzvah.' For the young Nimko Ali, any hope of help had gone.

A quarter of a century on and Ali remains furious but is determined to ensure that no other child will be left to suffer in silence as she did.

'It's easy to believe that this sort of thing only happens in other countries and cultures, but the reality is it's happening here in Britain,' she explains.

'For too long, it has been passed off as a "cultural" ritual. But this act is not about celebration. FGM is gender-based violence, it's as simple as that.

The practice tells women that they are merely "vessels" to carry children; they deserve no sexual pleasure.

'I've now made it my quest to stand up and fight against FGM.'

And her help is most certainly needed. Despite being illegal in the UK, FGM or female genital mutilation, is on the rise with an estimated 66,000 women dealing with the after-effects and more than 20,000 young girls thought to be at risk.

Worldwide, more than three million women have been subjected to FGM, many of whom come from East African countries such as Uganda, Kenya and Somalia.

Those countries, many of which are part of the Commonwealth, are at the heart of Britain's FGM problem, and as a result, the majority of British women to suffer FGM are part of the UK's 600,000-strong ethnic African community.

When people fled from Al Shabab in Somalia or Idi Amin in Uganda, many came to the UK - bringing with them local traditions, including FGM.

But East Africa isn't the only place where the practice is widespread. Women in Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Yemen and others are also highly likely to be forced to undergo FGM.

Although it is illegal to take a girl abroad for FGM under British law, Ali was just seven years old when she was taken to Somalia for a 'holiday' where she would be subjected to the horrific procedure.

'Towards the end of the holiday, we took a two-day drive through the desert, arriving eventually at a huge house,' remembers Ali.

'There was a woman at the door in a burka. I was scared and instinctively started running. When I was caught, I was taken into a room filled with instruments I didn't recognise.

'The woman I was so afraid of was there waiting for me. She scolded me for running away, telling me how difficult it was to obtain equipment like this; how ungrateful I was.

'I blacked out before she started cutting. I'm still not sure whether it was the anaesthetic or pure fear.'

When Ali awoke, it was to find herself 
in agony with her legs bound together. Although she was taken home to 
the UK two days later, Ali found that friends and teachers were 
unwilling to take her story seriously, leaving her feeling let down and 
alone.

Twenty two years later, Ali launched a charity, Daughters of Eve, with fellow FGM survivors Leyla Hussain and Sainab Abdi.

Change: Home Secretary Theresa May has pledged tougher rules in order to stamp out FGM in the UK

The trio travel the length and breadth of the UK, raising awareness and encouraging people to pressurise the Government into stopping the practice once and for all.

Although FGM has been illegal in the UK since 1985, there hasn't been a single conviction, despite overwhelming evidence that it still happens.

'Since I started campaigning, I've heard harrowing stories from girls all over England,' says Ali.

'The young woman who, after refusing FGM when she was taken to Egypt on a visit, endured beatings for the duration of the two week stay, and whose mother poured acid on her vagina when she was sleeping after they returned to England to gain a similar effect.

'A white English woman from Cornwall who came to tell us that she didn't previously have a name for what her dad did to her when she was 14, which was sew her up because she told him she was gay.'

Home Secretary Theresa May confronted the issue during a parliamentary debate on the issue earlier this year.

'Sadly, what we see are too many examples of this terrible crime continuing to take place,' she said.

'I think most people would be shocked to know how many young girls within the United Kingdom are subjected to female genital mutilation.

'We need to redouble our efforts to make sure we educate young girls about the prospects of being taken abroad or having this done to them, but also ensure that we educate others not to do this terrible act.'

The Home Secretary's efforts cannot come soon enough for Ali and girls like her who, Ali says, will likely endure lasting psychological and physical damage as a result of the mutilation.

'What I went through as a seven-year-old has stayed with me,' she says. 'But I have been lucky.

There are girls who are crippled by depression and anxiety, traumatised by what has happened to them and those that will never enjoy sex, and never find the strength to speak out.

'I want to help them all and let them know that they are not alone. Right now, they are victims. Soon, they'll be survivors.'
