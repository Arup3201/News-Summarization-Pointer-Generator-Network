Once it was the luxury home of Indian aristocrats who counted the royal family among their friends.

But today the 40-bedroom mansion of shipping magnate Sir Dhunjibhoy and Lady Bomanji appears to be trapped in a time warp, having been untouched for more than a quarter of a century.

It has been sold in a multi-million deal to a local businessman who wants to restore it to its former glory and make the 12-bathroom property in Harrogate, Yorkshire, a family home again.

Mansion: The 40-bedroom home of Sir Dhunjibhoy and Lady Bomanji in Harrogate, Yorkshire, which has been untouched for 27 years

A coffee grinder is on a wall next to a gas water heater in the kitchen, an invitation to a prestigious lunch in 1973 lies on a table alongside yellowed newspaper cuttings.

Sir Dhunjibhoy and Lady Bomanji were well-known figures in British high society at the start of the 20th 
century, and had three homes.

They spent each autumn 
at Pineheath after staying at their house in Windsor during the summer and spending 
the winters in Poona, India.

Fading glory: The mansion's morning room, where visitors would be taken when arriving at the house before lunch time to see the aristocratic owners

Unique:  Hand painted wallpaper dating from the 1920s was used by  Sir Dhunjibhoy and Lady Bomanji to decorate the mansion

Lasting legacy: The monogrammed initials of Sir Dhunjibhoy on the interior walls in Pineheath house

But their Harrogate mansion became a relic of the past when Lady Bomanji died in 1986. The couple's daughter, Mrs Mehroo Jehangir, passed away in 2012 leaving the property untouched for 27 years.

Bomanji was a philanthropist who used his wealth to support 
Britain's war effort against the Germans in World war One which led to him being knighted.

He gave generously to charities 
which supported ex-servicemen and war widows and included Field Marshal Douglas Haig amongst his 
social circle.

Knighted in 1922, Bomanji gifted a statue of Haig to 
Edinburgh Corporation in 1923, which is now located in Edinburgh Castle.

Hot equipment: A bathroom thermometer used to test the bath water in Pineheath house

High-tech in the seventies: A reel to reel tape player found in one of the mansion's rooms

Bathroom of the past: A stand alone bath with an ornate sink dating back more than three decades

In his later years before his death in
 1937, he is said to have ordered a custom built Rolls Royce with a high
 roof, so he could get in without bending because of back problems.

At
 a charity event in UK, he became the highest bidder for the donation 
and planted a kiss on the forehead of Hollywood actress Greta 
Garbo.
