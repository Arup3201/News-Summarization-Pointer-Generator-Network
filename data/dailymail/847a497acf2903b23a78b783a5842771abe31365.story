Fans of the iPhone 5S have begun lining up outside Apple's flagship store in New York City ahead of its official launch on Friday.

The first diehard customers have been spotted camping outside the gadget giant's Fifth Avenue store while iPhone lovers were also beginning to queue at London's Regent Street - one building a makeshift tent.

As the fall chill set in in New York, Apple aficionados brought rugs and sleeping bags to make their days-long wait a little more comfortable. Others brought camping chairs and of course their beloved Apple electronics to help the time pass.

The madness begins: Fans of the iPhone 5S have began lining up outside Apple's flagship store in New York City ahead of its official launch on Friday

Passersby snapped pictures of the dedicated campers, posting them to Twitter and Instagram.

In case fans somehow forgot, Apple sent out a reminder Tuesday that its iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C are going on sale on Friday.

Sales will begin at 8:00 a.m. local time at Apple's retail stores and at 12:01 a.m. PT via Apple's online store. They will also be available through various carriers.

The iPhone 5C, the more budget-friendly of the two models, was available for preorder on Friday but Apple has yet to release sales figures for the phone just yet. The iPhone 5S was not made available for preorder.

In London, Gad Harari, 17, was spending his second night in a makeshift tent on Regent Street on Tuesday as part of a four-day wait for the latest iPhone model, which comes with an in-built fingerprint scanner. He said he would only consider selling his spot for a four-figure sum.

Dedicated: Diehard fan Gad Harari, 17, has set up camp outside the Apple's flagship store in Regent Street, London, in a makeshift tent as part of a four-day wait for the iPhone 5S, which will be released on Friday

Fans: Mr Harari and friend Noah Green, also 17, have said they plan to buy the 5S, which was unveiled for the first time last week

He said he has already refused an 
offer of £200 for his place in the queue - predicting that people would 
offer up to £1,000 later on.

The
teen, who set up camp on Monday with friend Noah Green, also 17, has 
been sheltering from the wet weather under a green tent kitted out with 
all the latest technology, including one of Apple's MacBook laptops.

'We
are always among the first to get a new iPhone,' said Mr Harari, who is
a familiar face outside the firm's store. 'I came down last night to be
the first - this time we really wanted to be first.

'It's how you really show your dedication to Apple products. As well as that, you do have the opportunity to sell your space.'

The student, who
lives in Hendon, London, added: 'I would probably sell my place 
in the queue for about £1,000. There are crazy people who are willing to
do that.'

Worth the wait? Apple's new iPhone 5S (front) and iPhone 5C (back) have been eagerly awaited by fans. The 5S smartphone is available in three colours - silver, gold and 'space' grey

Both Mr Harari and Mr Green said they plan to buy the 5S, which was unveiled for the first time last week along with Apple's first mid-range phone the 5C. They both go on sale on Friday at 8am.

The 5S device, said to be twice as fast as its predecessor, sets itself apart from its competitors with its Touch ID feature. This allows users to unlock their phone and purchase apps with the touch of a finger.

Mr Green, from Stanmore, London, admitted he was supposed to be at college this week, but said: 'I don't think they'll mind because (joining the queue) is an ingenious idea.

'I'm really excited. It's going to be incredible, this launch. It's going to be the biggest yet.'

The student, who runs his own web business, said he has queued for Apple gadgets for the past four years.

'I collect Apple products,' he said. 'I pretty much have everything that Apple makes.'

The 5S - which comes in gold, silver or 'space' grey - is made of high-grade aluminum.

The cheaper 5C - introduced at a time when the tech giant arguably faces stiffer competition than ever before - represents Apple's first move away from the high-end market.

It comes in at less than $100.

Apple usually releases its advance order figures the Monday after a device becomes available for preorder so the lack of any announcement on Monday prompted some to wonder if the iPhone 5C didn't live up to past performance.

Meanwhile, the high-end iPhone 5S disappointed Wall Street and revived fears that Apple's most innovative days may be behind it. The phone has a fingerprint scanner to improve security, but analysts said that was not likely to be enough to make the iPhone 5S a sure win in the crowded smartphone market.

'There was nothing transformational announced. It has the fingerprint scan and new colors, but bigger features, like different screen sizes, don't seem to be at the ready. This was less than expected from a company that has a reputation for surprising with a killer product or strategy,' Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia said.

The iPhone 5s will reportedly cost $199 or 16GB, $299 for 32GB and $399 for the 64GB model on a plan.
