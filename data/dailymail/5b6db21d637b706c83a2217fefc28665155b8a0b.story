For ten months, he had been lying in a hospital bed, unconscious and unresponsive.

The injuries Mathew Taylor had suffered in a motorbike crash were so severe that his devastated family were warned he may never wake up.

But then came the phone call that would change everything. From her home in Bali 7,000 miles away, Mr Taylor’s fiancee  Handayani Nurul chatted to him – and at the sound of her voice, tears began trickling down his cheek.

True love: Mathew Taylor showed the first signs of life since his accident when his Balinese fiancee Anda Nurul spoke to him down the phone

Heady days: The couple fell in love and got engaged after Mr Taylor moved to Indonesia to teach English

Miss Nurul was forced to return home to Bali after a three-month visa ran out

It was the first time the 31-year-old had shown any sign of recovery since fracturing his skull in the 
horrific accident on the Indonesian island.

Now, every time the phone rings, Mr Taylor reaches out his hand.

Describing the moment Mr Taylor first 
responded to his fiancee’s voice, his stepfather Simon Moore said: ‘He 
had tears in his eyes as we held the phone to his ear. She asked him 
something and he said a silent yes.

‘Then tears were coming down his face. It  was brilliant.’

Now, Mr Taylor’s mother Heather calls Miss Nurul, known as Anda, and passes the phone towards her son.

Mr Moore said: ‘As soon as he hears 
her  voice he lifts his hand for the phone. He listens to her and you 
can see this change in him.’

Mr Taylor, from Overseal, Derbyshire, met 
Miss Nurul, 27, after he moved to Indonesia in 2009 to teach English.

The couple planned to get married, but Mr Taylor was knocked down while riding a motorcycle in Bali on July 9 last year.

As well as a fractured skull, he had to have his eye socket reconstructed, using bone taken from his thigh.

Following surgery, he slipped into a coma and has remained in a vegetative state ever since.

Mr Taylor had no medical insurance, 
so  his family were forced to raise £100,000 for  him to be treated in 
Bali. His father, Darrell Taylor, contributed £50,000 of his savings, 
while Mr Moore remortgaged his home to find the remaining £50,000.

Mr Taylor, 31, moved to Indonesia 18 months before his horrific motorbike accident

A coma is state in which a person is unaware of both self and external surroundings and unable to consciously feel, speak, hear, or move.

Doctors monitor consciousness levels by assessing eye opening, verbal responses and voluntary movements.

A higher score on the scale suggests that less brain function has been lost.

The cause of a coma and age of the patient are important in determining whether they will recover.

Some people remember events from when they were in a coma, while others do not. Most memories are likely to relate to the period when they were emerging from the coma.

Some people recall feeling reassured by the presence of a loved one when coming out of a coma.

A coma usually lasts for less than two to four weeks. It is unusual to remain in a coma for months or even years.

Generally, the longer the person has been in a coma, the poorer the outlook.

People do not usually suddenly 'wake up' from a coma, but regain brain function over time. Patients emerging from comas are often agitated and confused and may need to be sedated for their safety.

In October, Mr Taylor was transferred 
back to Britain, and his parents have kept a bedside vigil at Royal 
Derby Hospital ever since.

Miss Nurul managed to secure a visa so
 she could join them at his bedside for three months, but after that she
 was forced to return home to Bali, where she studies Dutch literature 
at the University of Indonesia.

Since the first phone call three weeks ago, Mr Taylor has slowly started to recover more movement in his body.

‘He’s really come on,’ said Mr Moore. 
‘He is still in a low awareness coma but he moves his  hand left and 
right when the phone rings. We are so pleased he is  recovering. We 
spend most of our days at hospital and some days are good and others bad
 but we take what we can get.

‘We are just happy he is responding.

Yesterday Luke Griggs, spokesman for 
brain injury charity Headway, said Mr Taylor could now make a full 
recovery.

He said: ‘Coma arousal programmes are often used to try to 
stimulate patients who are in reduced states of consciousness, such as a
 coma or a persistent vegetative state.

‘These carefully planned periods of 
stimulation – in the form of sound, touch, smell and taste – are 
combined with periods of complete rest in order not to overload the 
person’s senses.

‘While each individual case is 
different, in general terms the longer a person remains in a state of 
reduced consciousness, the less likely they are to make a full recovery.

‘We have heard of several examples of 
people waking from comas and going on to make good recoveries and live 
happy, fulfilled lives.

‘Examples like this demonstrate that coma arousal programmes may well be effective.’
