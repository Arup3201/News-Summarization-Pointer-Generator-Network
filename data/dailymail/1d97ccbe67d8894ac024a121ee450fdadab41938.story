Questions have been raised over the delay in the arrival of an ambulance to treat critically injured batsman Phil Hughes at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

A day after the 25-year-old was struck by a bouncer bowled by New South Wales' Sean Abbott, there have been conflicting reports about when an ambulance was called and when one arrived on Tuesday.

SCG officials confirmed on Wednesday they had called for an ambulance about six minutes after Hughes collapsed face first on the pitch, not 14 minutes as initially reported earlier on the same day.

That it took 23 minutes to arrive at the ground has raised serious concerns about the responsiveness of the NSW Ambulance service, prompting state Health Minister Jillian Skinner to demand an explanation from the ambulance commissioner, Sydney's Daily Telegraph reports.

Horrified onlookers, including Hughes' mother and sister, at SCG witnessed Hughes felling to the ground at 2.23pm on Tuesday as players rushed to his side to help him out.

2.23pm: Phil Hughes is hit by a bouncer bowled by Sean Abbott and falls to the ground

2.29pm: Sydney Cricket Ground staff raise the alarm and phone triple-0 for an ambulance

2.37pm: Another call is made to NSW Ambulance

2.44pm: An ambulance that responded to the second call for help arrives at SCG 

2.52pm: The ambulance responding to the first call made 23 minutes ago finally arrives at the scene 

On Wednesday morning, NSW Ambulance said it did not receive a triple-0 call until 2.37pm, but later clarified the first call was made by ground staff at 2.29pm. 

The confusion appears to have come about because the ambulance that responded to the 2.37pm call arrived first at the SCG at 2.44pm.

The ambulance called out at 2.29pm did not arrive until 2.52pm, NSW Ambulance said.

'A doctor provided treatment to the patient until paramedics arrived and assisted in stabilising him,' NSW Ambulance chief executive Commissioner Ray Creen said in a statement. 

A helicopter, with a specialist doctor and paramedic on board, as well as another road ambulance were also dispatched.

St Vincent's Hospital was identified as the closest hospital, and road the fastest and safest route.

Cardiologist Dr Ross Walker said he had 'no idea whatsoever' why it took six minutes for the first triple-0 call to be made. 

'You could see he staggered for a few seconds then went flat down, completely unconscious - that should have prompted a call to the ambulance immediately,' Dr Walker told The Today Show.

'One of the things we say in medicine is that "time is tissue" and the longer you wait to treat any acute injury or acute problem, the more tissue is damaged.

'And that's clearly the case here, because there was a time delay he's had now very severe brain injuries.'

But Dr Walker said Hughes might have sustained the same injuries regardless of response time.

'Because by the look of it he was cracked in the back of the skull over a place called the cerebellum, which is very close to the brain stem, and the brain stems a really important place for vital things like breathing and consciousness,' he said.

'And so if you get swelling into that area straight away and you rupture an artery and bleed into the area the brain stem can actually be compressed down through what we can the foramen magnum into the spinal cord which is where all this sort of stuff happens.'

Dr Walker added that he believed the ambulance took so long to arrive because ambulance services are overstretched.

Sydney Cricket and Sports Ground Trust defended its handling of the incident.

'SCG Trust staff followed the venue's emergency management plan quickly, calmly and professionally, as did staff from Cricket NSW and the NSW Ambulance Service,' communications director Phil Heads said.

Phil Hughes, 25, remains in a critical condition at St Vincent's Hospital at Darlinghurst - in Sydney's inner-city 

Hughes was put in an induced coma at Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital but tragically died on Thursday. 

Royal Prince Alfred Hospital neurosurgeon Dr Brindha Shivalingam told Sydney's Daily Telegraph time was of the essence when it came to injuries of all kinds but it was even more integral when it came to swelling on the brain.

She said the best thing for that was for paramedics to get the patient to the hospital as soon as possible.

'If there is a blood clot that has been created by an injury it will cause significant pressure on the brain, which is what causes death and injury,' Dr Shivalingam said.

'Unless that is relieved quickly your chances of recovery are slim.' 

Health Minister Skinner will meet with the ambulance commissioner on Thursday over the delays.

'Due to the conflicting information distributed today [Wednesday] by NSW Ambulance regarding yesterday's [Tuesday's] response to the Sydney Cricket Ground, I will be meeting with NSW Ambulance Commissioner Ray Creen tomorrow [Thursday] to discuss the circumstances surrounding the incident,' she said.

Doctors say the minutes after he was hit with a cricket ball were crucial as paramedics need to get patients to a hospital as soon as possible if they have a brain injury

'My thoughts remain with Phillip Hughes and his family, who I know are receiving the very best care at St Vincent's Hospital.'

This came as friends and family were seen flooding into the hospital where Hughes was staying on Wednesday while his relatives maintained a bedside vigil, awaiting any changes in his condition. 

On Wednesday, relatives including his brother Jason who introduced him to the sport, were joined at Hughes' bedside by close friend and Australia’s team captain Michael Clarke. 

The national skipper returned to the hospital about 7am on Wednesday morning after spending seven hours supporting Hughes in the intensive care unit on Tuesday night.

Clarke left the hospital at 10.20am and appeared downcast as he walked to the carpark with sunglasses on and his hands in his pockets. He drove away in a white Lexus sedan.

Fellow teammate Brad Haddin spent 40 minutes with the fallen batsman, coming out visibly distressed.
