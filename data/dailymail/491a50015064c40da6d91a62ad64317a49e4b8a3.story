New Zealanders are more likely to move home than residents of any other country, according to a new poll.

The survey on 'internal migration' - moving to a new city within the same country - reveals that North America and Scandinavia are also particularly mobile regions.

Overall, 381million adults have moved from one city to another within the past five years - eight per cent of the world's population.

Domestic migrants: New Zealand, the U.S. and Scandinavia all have many residents moving cities

New Zealand leads the way in the Gallup poll,
 with 26 per cent of its population on the move, followed by the U.S. on
 24 per cent, Finland on 23 per cent and Norway on 22 per cent.

Other countries which have seen high 
levels of internal migration include war-torn and poverty-stricken 
nations such as Syria and Malawi, where more than a fifth of the 
population has moved cities.

On the whole, however, people in 
richer countries seem to be more likely to move home than residents of 
the developing world - in China and Venezuela, for example, fewer than 
five per cent of people have moved.

Countries in the European Union are hovering around the global average, with nine per cent of their population on the move.

Numbers: This table shows that well-educated young people are the most likely to migrate internally

'Migration is often associated with 
the search for better educational opportunities, and across most 
regions, adults with higher education are more likely to be internal 
migrants,' Gallup explains.

'Worldwide,
 those with at least a college education are more than twice as likely 
(13 per cent) to say they moved internally in the past five years as 
those with primary education or less (five per cent).'

They argue there is no evidence of an education effect in regions such as the former USSR, where six per cent of people were internal migrants.

Among age groups, younger adults made up the greatest number of internal migrants.

Worldwide, 10 per cent of adults between 15 and 29 years of age reported moving within their country. After the age of 50 that number was only five per cent.

The study surveyed 236,865 adults in 139 countries representing than 97 per cent of the world's adult population, 'enabling a reliable global estimate,' according to Gallup.
