Nigella Lawson is going to have to get her U.S. visa sorted quickly - as The Taste has been recommissioned, MailOnline can reveal.

The curvaceous British TV chef, 54, who was last month refused entry to America because of her court confession that she took cocaine, has been a judge on the ABC reality show for two seasons.

And today, an ABC source today confirmed to MailOnline the show is returning. What this means for Nigella has yet to be seen as she will need to get her working visa approved by the U.S. embassy in London before she can embark on any filming.

Anguish: The past few months had clearly taken their toll as exhaustion was etched on Nigella Lawson's face as she stepped out of her London home after being banned from the US last month

Nigella has recently been in Wellington, New Zealand, filming a commercial for Whittakers chocolate and on Friday tweeted that she was back home in London, enjoying a jet-lagged supper of steak, broccoli, tomato salad, baked potato and baguette.

When asked how her trip was, she replied: 'Beautiful and delicious'.

The ‘Domestic Goddess’ was forced to 
confess under oath during a trial last year that she had snorted cocaine
 seven times and smoked cannabis in front of her children.

And last month, the Daily Mail told how Nigella was stopped from boarding a flight from Heathrow to Los Angeles.

She
 is thought to have checked in and passed security before being told she
 could not board her plane. She had to return to the first class 
check-in to arrange to collect her hold luggage.

Nigella
 is thought to have tried to enter the U.S. by registering online for 
permission to travel and confirming she had not been arrested or 
convicted of offences including taking illegal drugs. But the US can 
also decide to bar foreigners who have committed drugs offences without 
ever being charged. Would-be travellers can apply to have the ban 
lifted, but this can take months.

Nigella has since been invited by the U.S. Embassy in London to apply for a working visa - and could face a drug test by U.S. doctors.

At the time, her Taste co-star Anthony Bourdain today tweeted his support for the star, saying: 'I am absolutely mortified with embarrassment over the cruelty and hypocrisy of US actions re: #Nigella travel. Unbelievable.'

Season 2 of The Taste ended in February with 3.2 million viewers. And despite going up against NBC's Winter Olympics coverage, the show was up week to week by 7 per cent in total viewers - and up 14 per cent in women aged 18-34.

When Nigella 
made her return for season 2 of The Taste it was her big return to 
television screens following her very public divorce from Charles 
Saatchi.

She starred alongside French chef Ludo Lefebvre, cooking star Bourdain and Marcus Samuelsson on the show.

Ludo went on to reveal how he had grown 'very, very, very close' with Nigella, describing the mom-of-two as a 'great woman'.

He said it 'broke my heart' to see his co-star's ordeal during the trial of her former housekeepers who were cleared of fraud in December.

In an interview with The London Times, Ludo described how he first saw Nigella on television when he moved to America in 1996, but they met for the first time last year.

The married chef, 42, said: 'We have become very, very, very close - we click right away.'

He went on to say seeing the court appearance 'broke my heart' before adding: 'Have you heard anything like this before? No. Because she is a great woman.'

His wife, lawyer Kristine Lefebvre, went on to say Nigella had described the French chef as 'a very good-looking younger brother'.

Saucy: Nigella was certainly flirty when it came to winning over contestants on the show, who were hoping to be picked by the panel of chefs

On The Taste, the judges must decide whether they want the cook based solely on the taste.‘Food is never just food, it’s exquisite and it appeals to every sense,’ Nigella said. ‘It can change your life.’

Nigella had to give evidence at
 the trial of her former housekeepers, Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo, 
who were accused of stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds from her 
and ex-husband Charles Saatchi.

While insisting she had never been an addict or habitual user of drugs, she confirmed she had taken cocaine.

She
 said she needed the drugs to cope with the death of her first husband, 
John Diamond, and the ‘intimate terrorism’ of her second, Mr Saatchi.
