These incredible images show the moment a fearless diver gets up close and personal with one of the most dangerous
sharks in the world.

Carlos Estrabeau not only swam alongside bull sharks without a cage, he even coaxed them to open their mouths so he could feed them fish.

Freediver Carlos has been swimming with the bull sharks near
to his home in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico for several years.

Feeding frenzy: Nerveless diver Carlos Estrabeau gets so close to a bull shark he is able to feed fish directly into its mouth

Steady nerves: The bull shark is one of the most feared species and is responsible for the majority of attacks on humans

And remarkably he has now come to know the creatures so well
he considers them as his friends and has them quite literally eating out of the
palm of his hand.

These images were taken by photographer and freediver Amanda
Cotton who joined Carlos on one of his many dives in a bid to show a different
side to the usually feared creatures.

Amanda, from Florida, USA, said: 'On this particular
trip we were in Mexico documenting and shooting the bull sharks in support of
conservation efforts to protect the pregnant females that move through to give
birth in the area.

'I work with several different species of sharks and
never feel scared while in the water with them, or are in close proximity to
them.

'In fact I consider it a gift to get close to the
animals, as they are typically so shy and afraid of divers.

'Carlos loves the bulls that come through Playa del
Carmen like they were his own children.

'He has worked diligently to protect the pregnant
females that move through the area.

'Many of the sharks he works with year after year and
he has grown to know the individual sharks and their distinct personalities
very well.

Calm and collected: Diver Carlos says that he has become completely comfortable with the bull sharks which swim near his home in Playa Del Carmen in Mexico

'Sharks are typically very timid and shy of scuba
divers, to capture the open mouth images the Carlos has to lead the bait into
the camera lens.

'We wear special chainmail suits to ensure we're
protected from accidental bites as the shark moved in to collect the bait.

'Feeding of sharks is only done by highly trained
professionals who utilize protective gear, such as the chainmail suits, in
order to protect both the shark and the feeder.

'Professional feeders spend years learning the
technique. Feeding sharks should never be attempted without proper training,
equipment and experience.

'I think in many of the images I've captured the sharks
look like they are smiling.

'I like having this kind of imagery out there, it helps
promote a different side of sharks and helps dispel the myths about sharks.

'Sharks are so misunderstood and many species of shark
are in serious trouble and need protection.

'My biggest goal with my work and with my imagery, is
to share a side of sharks that most people don't see, to help others see the
beautiful and graceful side that is all too often lost in sensationalised
over-the-top portrayals seen in movies, on television and in books.

'I hope to show a different perspective to sharks, show
they can peacefully and beautifully interact with divers underwater, that there
is grace and beauty in them.

'I want people to see the sharks the way I see them,
with love and admiration.'
