A former U.S. Army sniper arrested in a plot of assassinate a DEA agent nearly wept and his lips quivered in his New York jail cell when his attorney visited him this week, the lawyer says.

Joseph Manual Hunter was arrested in Thailand last week, accused of running an international cartel of hitmen 'straight from the pages of Tom Clancy' and plotting to murder a federal agent for $800,000.

Defense attorney Marlon Kirton told a U.S. District Court judge in New York on Tuesday that he suspects his client is suffering from mental illness and possibly Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder from his deployment to Iraq.

Wanted: Joseph Manuel Hunter has been on the run since June, when U.S. authorities issued a warrant for his arrest in New York

'He has some issues related to his service,' Kirton said outside court. 'He was almost weeping.'

Hunter, 48, served in the Army from 1983 until 2004.

Charges against him were were 
announced by prosecutors in Manhattan last week, who portrayed Hunter and 
his accomplices as ex-soldiers eager to kill for money.

'That's fun, actually for me that's fun. I love this work,' an ex-German soldier was quoted in court papers as saying.

The attorney for that soldier, Dennis Gogel, said he believes his client was entrapped.

During his time in the military from 1983 to 2004, Hunter was a sniper instructor and drill sergeant before allegedly becoming a career contract killer who
arranged the murder of 'multiple people' overseas.

He was reportedly highly decorated by the time he left the service.

At one meeting, Hunter was captured on tape describing how he
had arranged the killings of real estate agents. Authorities said those
killings had occurred outside the United States, though they did not provide
specifics.

He
was caught in an international sting operation by the DEA, in which 
agents posed as Colombian drug lords and offered Hunter a contract to 
kill a fellow DEA agent and informer in Liberia for $800,000.

An
attorney for the Federal government said:'The charges tell a tale of an
international band of mercenary marksmen who enlisted their elite 
military training to serve as hired guns for evils ends.'

'The bone-chilling allegations in today’s indictment read like they were ripped from the pages of a Tom Clancy novel.'

Hunter allegedly enlisted the services of a former German army sniper Dennis Gogel and fellow US veteran Timothy Vamvakias after searching through online resumes when he was offered the 'job' to kill the DEA agent.

Hunter recruited several ex-soldiers in late 2012 and early
this year to be a security team for drug traffickers, said the indictment.
According to the court papers, the DEA's sources promised Hunter at a March
meeting in an Asian country that his security team would be protecting
thousands of kilos of marijuana and would be seeing "tons of cocaine and
millions of dollars."

Mr Bharara said the activities of Hunter could have been ripped straight from the pages of a Tom Clancy novel

Audio and video recordings of the meeting show Hunter
discussing "bonus jobs" of contract killings, saying the men he had
recruited want to do as much "bonus" work as possible, the indictment
said.

When assassinations of a federal agent and an informant were
proposed, Hunter "didn't flinch at the chance," Bharara said. He
boasted that his men could handle both jobs, the prosecutor said, adding that
"from there, it was off to the races."

The indictment said a DEA source posing as a drug trafficker in May proposed to the snipers that they kill a DEA agent and a boat captain providing information to U.S. law enforcement authorities, saying it was necessary because there was a "leak" within the narcotics trafficking organization.

In an email exchange, Hunter responded: "My guys will handle it. ... Are you talking about both the captain and agent or just the captain?" according to the indictment.

They ordered submachine guns, pistols, and sophisticated latex masks and shipped them to Africa in preparation for the hit.

The arrests occurred in Phuket, but authorities say Hunter and his gang ranged all over Southeast Asia trafficking drugs

But the DEA intercepted Gogel and Vamvakias in Africa before organising the arrest of Hunter this week.

Thai
police said the DEA contacted Thai authorities several months ago to 
say that Hunter was believed to be hiding in Phuket, where he had rented
a house.

Another former German sniper and a Polish counter-terror expert were also arrested this week and will be extradited to the US.

Derek Maltz, special agent in charge of the DEA Special
Operations Division, said the snipers were caught by agents dedicated to
"outwit them, outwork them, outsmart them and put them out of
business."

 He added: "As much as this indictment reads like the
script of a movie, it's real."
