Musicians and former Liverpool football stars have joined forces to record a charity single to help the families of victims of the Hillsborough disaster.

Sir Paul McCartney and Robbie Williams have been helped by former manager Kenny Dalglish and defender and Match of the Day pundit Alan Hansen for the single, a cover of The Hollies He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother.

They are joined by Gerry Marsden, John Bishop, Mel C, Paloma Faith and Shane MacGowan in the bid to raise vital cash for the families continuing to fight for justice for the 96 Liverpool fans who lost their lives in the 1989. The group is known as The Justice Collective.

Pitching in: John Bishop joins in with the rendition, which is produced by Liverpudlian Guy Chambers, who said he was 'deeply honoured'

Liverpudlian Guy Chambers, who is 
producing the charity single, hopes the single can raise £1million - if 
it reaches the No 1 spot after its official release on December 17.

He told The Daily Mirror: 'I am deeply honoured to be asked to produce this record for the 96.

'If
we can help to raise money to support the families’ legal battle so 
that they finally get their time in court then our job will be done.

'I
spent my teenage years in Liverpool and feel a deep affection for both 
its musical heritage and the unique solidarity of its people.'

Dalglish,
who was manager at the time of the disaster, said that the victims' 
families would be given 'tremendous reassurance' if the single did well 
in the charts.
