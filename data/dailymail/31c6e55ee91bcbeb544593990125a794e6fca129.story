Chris Ramsey says it is proven that racism is still rife and has called on the authorities to 'weed them out of football'.

Chelsea supporters caused outrage after being seen filmed repeatedly pushing a black man off the train earlier this week.

The shocking footage of the gang refusing victim Souleymane S on the Paris Metro sparked a furious response from Ramsey.

New QPR manager Ramsey, the only black manager in the Premier League, said: 'There's no place for racism in football

'I don't believe these people are fans of football.

'It would be good to know what the authorities are going to do to weed these people out and what sanctions they will enforce to make this an avoidable situation in the future.

'These people are acting in a manner we all think is a thing of the past.'

Ramsey says football needs to come together to eradicate racial hatred from the game.

He said: 'I've experienced a lot of racism in my time in the game. I started back in 1978. It gets shuffled about and hidden.

The amateur footage goes on to show passengers in the carriage following the disgraceful incident

'I have suffered from it, I don't want to go into the details.

'I don't want it to be about me, I want to focus on what happened in that situation in Paris so everyone shines a spotlight on that and that I doesn't happen again.

'It is a reminder that it is still there, I'm sure there are people trying their best to make sure it stays out of the public eye – there are people with these views and we need to keep them away from the game.

'Football as a whole needs to deal with these racists - and people outside of football as well. It's a crime.

'As much as this is something that has happened in football, it's still a society issue in general.'
