New EU president Jean-Claude Juncker is set to earn £1.8million in pay and perks over the next five years, following David Cameron's failure to block his appointment last week.

The former Luxembourg Prime Minister will head up the powerful Commission until 2019 following his election by European leaders on Friday.

Mr Juncker, 59, a veteran Brussels fixer who favours a United States of Europe, will earn £245,629.70 a year - almost double Mr Cameron's £142,000 pay packet.

The salary is topped up by a 'residential allowance' of £184,222.25 over five years and can look forward to a £52,500-a-year pension for life, figures published in the Sun reveal.

Details of Mr Juncker's pay packet will spark further controversy in Britain following his controversial appointment last week in the face of furious resistance by Mr Cameron.

The Prime Minister was left humilated after EU leaders voted 26 to two in favour of Mr Juncker, leaving Britain closer to the exit door.

Speaking after Mr Juncker's appointment, Mr Cameron admitted keeping Britain in the EU had been made 'harder' by the decision to ignore his opposition.

He said the appointment had been a 'huge step backwards', but added: ‘Frankly, sometimes you have to be ready to lose a battle in order to win a war.’

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today backed Mr Cameron's claim that the development had left Britain closer to leaving Europe.

His remarks came after polls showed British voters agreed that it was now more likely the UK will cut its ties with Brussels.

According to the Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday, a total of 47 per cent want to leave the EU, with 39 in favour of staying in.

Asked how they would vote in a referendum if Mr Cameron fails to get a better deal for Britain, the number who want to leave rises to 49 per cent, while those wishing to stay in falls to 31, a massive 18-point margin.

However, if Mr Cameron defies the odds and persuades Mr Juncker to restore some of Britain’s sovereignty, the UK could yet stay in Europe.

A total of 41 per cent would vote to stay in in such circumstances, with a hardcore of 37 resolutely in favour of leaving.

He also attacked EU leaders for saying they would oppose Mr Juncker in private only to then support him publicly.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, appearing on the Andrew Marr show this morning, accused Mr Cameron of being 'cack handed'

Foreign Secretary William Hague told Andrew Marr that it remained the Government's aim to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU in order to stay in

David Cameron said on Friday that Mr Juncker's appointment was a 'huge step backwards'

European Council President Herman Van Rompuy was forced to call a vote of European leaders on Mr Juncker's appointment following Mr Cameron's opposition

A leading member of Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet has claimed David Cameron may try to con voters by claiming to have overhauled Britain's relationship with Brussels - even if he has won 'very little'.

Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson said Mr Cameron had thrown away his negotiating hand with the EU - but may try to convince the public he has achieved a fundamental renegotiation.

He said Mr Cameron 'might do a Harold Wilson' but questioned whether the public would vote to stay in like 1975.

'What Harold Wilson did, and David Cameron is following in his footsteps, he said that he didn't agree with the terms that Ted Heath had negotiated, he was going to renegotiate the terms and then he put it to the people in a referendum.

'Through the long renegotiation, we got absolutely damn all – indeed, I doubt there's anyone alive today who can remember what he did get out of it, it was so trivial – but he presented it as a great success, and people bought it.

'I think David Cameron could try to do the same; he will get very little and he will present it as something.'

Speaking to the Independent on Sunday, Lord Lawson said Mr Cameron should have threatened to campaign for Britain to leave the EU as a way of strengthening his negotiating position with fellow European leaders.

Instead, the Prime Minister had 'made it quite clear that he doesn't want to exit … so he has no negotiating hand to speak of', Lord Lawson said.

Asked whether the Prime Minister could threaten to withdraw in the run-up to the referendum, Lord Lawson said: 'Yes, but he hasn't. That is what's surprising, that he's made it quite clear that he doesn't want to exit, which doesn't strengthen his negotiating hand.

'If David Cameron had said, "Well, I'm not sure how to vote. It depends on what I am able to negotiate", that would have been a stronger hand.

'But he's actually made it clear he's going to vote for "in" irrespective, so he has no negotiating hand to speak of.'

Mr Hunt said: 'As a result of cowardice yesterday from other leaders who weren't prepared to stand up in public and say the things they had said in private, they're going to have to work a lot harder to persuade the British people that Europe can be trusted with a proper reform agenda.'

This morning the Foreign Secretary William Hague refused to say if he thought it would be a disaster if Britain left the European Union.

He said the 'objective' should be to overhaul Britain's relationship with the EU in order to stay in. But Mr Hague said: 'The British people will decide if that is sustainable or not.'

But Mr Cameron's failure in Europe was this morning attacked by Labour, who accused the Prime Minister of being 'cack handed'.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the week's events had been a 'catastrophe for Britain and the British national interest'.

He told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show: 'What is David Cameron's European policy? Does he think we should be in Europe, I do.

'I think that we will only be influential in the world if we are influential in Europe. Does he want reform? He says he does but he can't tell us what his reforms are.'

'He's weak, he's lost control, he's on the back foot, Britain is suffering. I think it's catastrophic for Britain.'

Mr Balls added: 'I've never seen a negotiation so cack-handed.'

Labour leader Ed Miliband went further - claiming that the PM now posed a 'real and present danger' to the British economy.

The Labour leader said the 'debacle' over Mr Juncker's nomination had taken the UK closer to the 'exit door' that could put three million jobs and tens of thousands of businesses at risk.

He said: 'The lesson of the Juncker debacle is that David Cameron and the Conservative Party now pose a real and present danger to our economy.

'He could not build alliances and his threats succeeded only in turning a Europe that was divided over the best candidate for commission president into a Europe united against him.

'There can be no better indicator of how a Conservative government would damage Britain's national interest and Britain's businesses if it were to win a second term next year.'

He added: 'But the isolation he achieved this week is not "splendid". It shows he is incapable of reforming Europe and his strategy of getting change by making threats to leave to get change does not work.

'All it does is take Britain closer to an exit door through which three million British jobs and tens of thousands of businesses could disappear.'

Business chief John Cridland said the country's economic success depended on it remaining a full member of the EU.

The CBI director general said: 'The EU is our biggest export market and remains fundamental to our economic future. Our membership supports jobs, drives growth and boosts our international competitiveness. Alternatives to full membership of the EU simply wouldn't work.'
