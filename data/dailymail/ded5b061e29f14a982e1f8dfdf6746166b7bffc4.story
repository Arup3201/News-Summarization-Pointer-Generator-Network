X Factor star Chloe Jasmine Whichello may have  had  a secret boyfriend since the start of the show, despite claims judges gave her preferential treatment because she was heartbroken and single.

The controversial singer was allowed to perform for judges twice after fluffing her first audition because of a break-up of a relationship.

But it has now emerged that she has been dating Craig Wiffen, a businessman and former soldier for several months, a source said today.

Mr Wiffen's twitter account says that Miss Whichello is his girlfriend and he has posted a number of romantic messages and photographs of the singer.

On Sunday, as Chloe was about to be shown performing at judge Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's house in Nice, he wrote: 'Good luck tonight to my very beautiful and very talented girlfriend @CHLOEJASMINEW. I am and always will be very proud of you x'.

Controversial: Having already been embroiled in a fix row, Chloe's X Factor journey has not been smooth

An X Factor source confirmed they are a couple, but would not confirm how long they had been together.

Chloe-Jasmine Whichello's path to the live shows has been controversial, with some viewers claiming her success has been part of a wider fix.

During her first audition at Wembley Arena broadcast in September she tried to sing jazz song Misty, but when stood in front of 5,000 people she forgot the lyrics and burst into tears.

But viewers only saw her second audition in front of a different crowd on the following day, which left the judges impressed and was put through to the next stage after performing another song. 

A ITV source told The Sun: 'Chloe's original arena audition was so bad it was never shown. It was a car crash.

'Chloe was given a second chance as she was upset during her first performance.

'She had recently split up with her boyfriend so she wasn't in a fit state to perform. We gave her the chance to go away and compose herself'.  

Chloe, who was selected as one of Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's three live show acts over the weekend, has had elocution lessons since the age of 11 as part of her drama school background. 

An ex-boyfriend of the model-turned-singer recently claimed she is a wild child who often went on booze and drug benders.  Dave Kai Piper told The Sun that it was 'like dating Courtney Love'. 

It was also claimed she was allegedly a fan of attending posh orgies and she was a regular guest at the events organised by Killing Kittens, though the company tweeted on Saturday 'it's news to us.'

It also emerged that she had previously auditioned for The X Factor in 2006, when then-judge Sharon Osbourne branded her 'every parent's nightmare'. 

Mr Wiffen posted this picture of the singer apparently watching television in bed a fortnight ago

And he posted this picture of Chloe in a well-cut dress last month, adding the hashtag #teamCJ
