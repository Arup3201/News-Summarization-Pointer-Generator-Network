Chelsea playmaker Oscar has praised Cesc Fabregas' impact at Stamford Bridge - and already feels his partnership with the Spaniard can guide Chelsea to the Premier League title.

Fabregas arrived in a £30million deal from Barcelona this summer and was seen by some as a replacement for Oscar in attacking midfield - but instead the pair started Chelsea's two opening games together before the Brazilian missed out at Everton through injury.

And Oscar is already pleased with the way things are going, holding the belief that the similarity between himself and Fabregas makes them the perfect partnership to power Chelsea's midfield.

Perfect pair? Oscar is enjoying playing alongside Cesc Fabregas in Chelsea's midfield this season

Pass master: Oscar reckons that he and Fabregas are very similar - and that helps Chelsea to win games

In and out: Oscar started in Chelsea's two opening games but injury ruled him out of the trip to Everton

'Maybe it’s the way Fabregas plays,' Oscar told Chelsea magazine.

'He plays very similarly to me – but we have worked very well together in the first games of this season and we also get on very well. He came into the team and immediately he fitted in very well.

'Coming deeper to get the ball is something that I’ve always done, but it is also something that the manager likes me to do and, in the same way, Fabregas and Willian also do it. 

Impressive: The Brazilian playmaker looked back to his best against Burnley in Chelsea's opening game

Club and country: Oscar identified Willian as another player who likes to drop back to find space

'We have been switching positions a lot and we hope to perfect that as the season goes on because it has been working very well for the team.' 

Chelsea have won all three of their opening games in the Premier League and this weekend come up against the league's only other side boasting a 100 per cent record - Swansea.

But Oscar believes that even after an international break that sees him and Brazil team-mates play against Ecuador in Rio de Janerio at 2am UK time on Wednesday, the Blues will be ready to resume their title charge when they return to action at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.

'I think that we are looking very good at the moment. All the players are at a high level, but now we have to continue playing well because every one of us wants to win the Premier League this season.'
