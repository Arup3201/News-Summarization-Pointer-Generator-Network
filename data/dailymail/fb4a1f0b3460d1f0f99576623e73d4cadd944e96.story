A ten-year-old girl has been threatened with being stoned to death is she does not withdraw a rape claim against a neighbour from a higher caste.

The family of the girl, who was detained in a women's police station alone for a night, is now under police protection amid the threats.

Her mother took her to Kotwali women's police station after finding her unconscious in a field.

The girl says a 35-year-old neighbour raped her, but the family says they are under pressure to drop the claim and accept a settlement instead.

The mother told the Indian Express: 'They have been threatening to kill us, burn down our ancestral home and stone my daughter to death if we do not withdraw the rape case.

'Even the village panchayat (council), including the sarpanch (leader), is in favour of the accused and is asking the family to settle the matter.'

An inquiry into why the girl was jailed for the night is underway with four officers from the station, nearÂ  Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh, suspended.

A police superintendent told the Daily Telegraph that the girl's detention was a 'misunderstanding' while the family is under the impression it was to try to make them too scared to pursue the claim.

Vaibhav Krishna, who is leading the inquiry into her overnight stay, said a man had been arrested for the alleged rape.

But the man, from the Lodhe Rajputs caste, denied the allegation and claimed the girl had been scared after he told her off for picking tomatoes from a neighbour's field, ran away and made the claim.

Superintendent Krishna said a medical examination was inconclusive as to whether an assault had taken place.
