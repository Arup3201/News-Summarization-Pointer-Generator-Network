It’s my favourite day of the year. Better than Christmas. Transfer Deadline Day is looming – so let the fun begin on MailOnline.

For sports news operations, it is a chance to flex your muscles, show your medals, break the stories of the latest deals and then publish them as fast as is possible.

In our office, the day starts at around 6am and finishes at midnight. It’s an adrenalin rush of breaking news and revealing detail (and hoping it’s Manchester United, Arsenal or Liverpool signing someone in a desperate late dash and not just relying on Scunthorpe or Bury taking a left back on loan… please).

Deadline Day exclusives: You read it first on MailOnline last year - Marouane Fellaini to United (left) and Mesut Ozil to Arsenal (right) were revealed by Sportsmail's brilliant reporting team

All the breaking news appears first in our yellow ticker (below)... Make sure you log on to the Sports Website of the Year first thing on Monday morning and follow all the Deadline Day drama at:

It’s MailOnline v Sky Sports News v Radio 5Live v talkSPORT. The best of television sport, the best of radio sport and the most complete sports service on the internet.

Actors are often told to avoid working with animals and to avoid walking down steps in live shows. Add Sky reporters working with a bunch of screaming kids outside a training ground, where you know one of them has been dared by their mates to see how rude their gesture can be.

Like MailOnline's reporters hitting their phones, the TV reporters are desperate for that news nugget that will illuminate the coverage and leave rivals floundering for confirmation.

We’ve delivered before. We’ll deliver this time. Here are the links to the big stories we broke this time last year when Ozil went to Arsenal (by Sami Mokbel) and Fellaini to Manchester United (by Martin Samuel). Soon ‘Sky Sources’ were reporting the same news. They have good sources.

Our reporters know they have to deliver information as quickly as possible for you, our readers.

Will it be Danny Welbeck? Sandro, or even Anderson (surely someone has to take him?). Will Arsenal sign a striker? Where will Petr Cech be at the end of the day? How many players will Harry Redknapp be linked with? What about that unpronounceable Russian winger who might be arriving in the back of a car under a cover in a Bond-like smuggling act?

It’s MailOnline Sport on Transfer Deadline Day (or TDD on MoL in the modern age of abbreviating everything)… first for stories. And a chance to see it unfold without having to listen to Jim White. 

What more can you football fans ask for?
