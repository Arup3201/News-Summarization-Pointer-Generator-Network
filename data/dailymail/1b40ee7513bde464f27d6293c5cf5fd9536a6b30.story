The Met Office has admitted that global warming has stalled.

Officials say that by 2017, temperatures will not have risen significantly for nearly 20 years.

They concede that previous forecasts were inaccurate – and have come under fire for attempting to ‘bury bad news’ by publishing the revised data on Christmas Eve.

Rise: The earlier Met Office predictions show a much sharper rise in projected global temperatures through to 2016...

Fall: But the new computer model predicts temperatures will stay relatively flat

Now a press release, published 
yesterday, has confirmed that over the next five years temperatures will
 be 0.43 degrees above the 1971-2000 average, instead of the previously 
forecast 0.54 degrees – a 20 per cent reduction.

This rise would be only slightly 
higher than the 0.4-degree rise recorded in  1998, an increase which is 
itself attributed by forecasters to an exceptional weather phenomenon.

With all but 0.03 degrees of the 
increase having occurred by 1998, the revision means that no further 
significant increases to the planet’s temperature are expected over the 
next few years.

The figures have been seized on by 
sceptics of man-made climate change, who claim that global warming has 
flatlined despite a large rise in greenhouse emissions in recent 
decades.

Dr David Whitehouse, science adviser 
to the Global Warming Policy Foundation, said: ‘That the global 
temperature standstill could continue to at least  2017 would mean a 
20-year period of  no statistically significant change in global 
temperatures.

‘Such a period of no increase will 
pose fundamental problems for climate models. If the latest Met Office 
prediction is correct, then it will prove to be a lesson in humility.’

However, Dr Richard Allan of the 
University of Reading said: ‘Global warming is not “at a standstill” but
 does seem to have slowed down since 2000, in comparison to the rapid 
warming of the world since the 1970s.

‘In fact, consistent with rising greenhouse gases, heat is continuing to build up beneath the ocean surface.’

He was backed by Bob Ward of the London School of Economics, who said it would be wrong to interpret that warming had stopped.

However, he also condemned the Met Office for releasing data without an explanation of its full meaning.

‘It’s true to say this isn’t the Met Office’s finest hour,’ he said.

‘The sceptics have simply exploited 
that fact. I think on this particular occasion the Met Office has fallen
 short of the standards one would expect of them.’

Labour MP Graham Stringer said the Met Office’s short-term forecasts had improved, but their climate change analysis was ‘poor’.

He said: ‘By putting out the 
information on Christmas Eve they were just burying bad news – that they
 have got their climate change forecast wrong.

‘For a science-based organisation, they should be more up front, both about their successes and failures.’

The Met Office said the updated 
five-year predictions were a result of a new modelling system, which 
takes into account changes in ocean surface temperatures, and was 
released as soon as practically possible.

Evidence: Temperatures will not rise as rapidly as feared, according to Met Office figures

It claims the slow-down in temperature
 rises after a steep increase in the 1990s could be explained by natural
 variability, changes in solar activity, and the movements of the 
oceans.

Forecasts of continued global warming  are driven largely by increasing levels of greenhouse gases.

Experts warn that without efforts to 
reduce emissions, the world is on course for dangerous temperature rises
 in the next century.

Professor Myles Allen of the 
University of Oxford said: ‘A lot of people  were claiming, in the 
run-up to the Copenhagen 2009 conference, that warming was accelerating 
and it is all worse than we thought.

‘What has happened since then has demonstrated that it is foolish to extrapolate short-term climate trends.

‘While every new year brings in 
welcome new data to help us rule out the more extreme scenarios for the 
future, it would be equally silly to interpret what has happened since 
the early 2000s as evidence that the warming has stopped.’
