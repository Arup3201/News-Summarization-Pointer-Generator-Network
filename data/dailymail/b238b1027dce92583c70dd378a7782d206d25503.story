Australian's receiving the dole could soon be subjected to mandatory drug testing in order to continue receiving payments.

The harsh suggestion is part of a major overhaul of the welfare system by the Abbott government.

Inspiration for the change has come from New Zealand's welfare system which halves welfare recipients' payments when they fail a job-required drug test or refuse to submit to one.

The Abbott government has confirmed it is looking towards New Zealand's welfare system policies which require job seekers to undergo job-related drug tests or face cuts to their payments

The recipients must pay back their welfare payments if they continue to use drugs after 30 days.

Social Services Minister Kevin Andrews said 'We won't rule this in or out.'

But the hardline approach has shown little result in New Zealand where only 22 of 8001 welfare receiving job seekers tested positive to drug use or had refused to take tests.

Despite this, the government will look towards New Zealand's welfare system which Mr Andrews told the Herald Sun, was simpler and less expensive than Australia’s current structure.

'While Australia's welfare system is different from New Zealand, its reforms provide a guide as to the government’s thinking on simplifying our welfare system,' he said.

'This review will look at welfare reforms overseas, including New Zealand where they have simplified their welfare system by introducing five new payments that replaced eleven old payments.'

New Zealand's newly reformed payment system now includes a Jobseeker Support payment for those actively looking for work, Sole Parent Support for single parents with children aged under 14 years, and Supported Living Payments for people significantly limited by sickness, injury or disability.

The suggested changes come during a welfare system overhaul by the government as it awaits the results of a report which reviews the current system

Mr Andrews said that Australia’s welfare system was complex in comparison to it’s neighboring country.

It currently administers around 20 varying payments with around 50 different supplements that he claimed were costing taxpayers approximately $100 billion annually.

'To make this work requires more than 3500 pages of legislation and more than 640 pages of endnotes to administer the social security system,' he said.

However, Mr Andrews acknowledged that similar changes to welfare would be more difficult to administer in Australia as it would require support from individual states.
