Eric Boullier is set to replace Martin Whitmarsh as McLaren team principal after resigning from his role at Lotus. Read the full story.

It was a launch that said everything about the plight of bedraggled McLaren: no title sponsor, no team principal, one venerable driver and one rookie.

That is about the reality of the sorry production from the team's headquarters in Woking today.

It was all a far cry from the sumptuous launches of another richer and more hopeful era.

There was no Cirque de Soleil to entertain the great and the good as there was a few short years ago in vibrant Valencia, where Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso were paraded as totems of McLaren's total ambition.

‘There has been a lot of negative press about the way the cars look but personally apart from the funny little bit at the front which is in the regulations, our car looks beautiful,' Jenson Button said.

'I think it looks really nice and we have done the best we could with the regulations that we were given.

'We don’t go out our way to make the car look pretty - it is about being quick - but the car needs to look good as well. The fans don’t want to see us drive around in a square box. The beauty is still there.'

Admittedly the other teams have also gone for small launches, or none at all, because the massive technical regulation changes for the new season means they are in a mighty hurry to be ready in time for testing next week in Jerez, but one imagines that McLaren would still have staged a grander ceremony had they not been in their current predicament.

Sad to say that while Whitmarsh was not here – he was on holiday in France pending his dismissal as team principal after Ron Dennis, the group chairman, took charge of F1 affairs as chief executive last week – the conequences of his dismal five-year tenure overlaid the launch of the MP4-29 chassis.

Eric Boullier is the favourite to take Whitmarsh's place after the Frenchman this morning resigned from his post as team principal Lotus. If he is to be installed, it means Dennis has missed out on his supposed No 1 target Ross Brawn.

Whitmarsh had long promised an 'exciting announcement' in December about a replacement for Vodafone. None came.

Instead, last week Jonathan Neale, the managing director, said McLaren were nonetheless in a strong position owing to long-term sponsorship deals with Hugo Boss, Tag Heuer and Hilton. That is an impressive roster but it still felt like an excuse for failing to meet their stated objective.

Whatever the Brawn/Boullier conundrum, one thing for certain is that Sam Michael will not be handed Whitmarsh's team principal's job as part of Dennis's review. A nice enough chap, the best we can say about his record in F1 is that it is patchy.

But that's enough doom and gloom. For if last season's podium-free record and the dismissal of Whitmarsh was the nadir, at least a new season and Ron Dennis's declaration to, 'write an exciting new chapter in the story of McLaren, beginning by improving our on-track and off-track performance,' offers significant hope.

Honda's arrival as engine partners next season is another massive fillip. But this new car, powered by Mercedes and with its long nose, will be struck up in Jerez on Tuesday, providing the first indication of whether 2014 can help banish McLaren's gloom.
