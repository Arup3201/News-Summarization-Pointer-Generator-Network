After a three hour stand off, police entered the building and a first man in a white t-shirt was seen being escorted out of the premises, handcuffed and then searched.

Police then walked out two women hostages followed by another man, who was taken into custody at the scene. 

Police say over the course of the operation, three men, aged 36, 40, 44 were taken into custody and have been taken to Liverpool Police Station where they will be interviewed by detectives. 

Earlier negotiators on the scene were making attempts to speak with a man inside the business, while tactical officers were seen crouching behind several vehicles pointing their guns. 

Crowds gathered to watch as the situation unfolded but were held back by police tape. 

A perimetre has been established as a precaution and George street between Moore and Scott streets has been closed down.

A number of adjourning businesses were also cleared. 

Sam Bruzzese, a real estate agent at Elders which is around 50 to 100 metres from where the incident is, told Daily Mail Australia police were everywhere.

'One person was taken out before but the street is still closed and there's nothing much going on at the moment,' he said.

Mr Bruzzese admitted that he hadn't noticed any problems at the business before.

'Reports someone is being held hostage, don't know if someone got upset or is chasing someone.'

'I wouldn't get too close, you don't know what could happen.' 

The operation involved officers from Liverpool Local Area Command, the Tactical Operations Unit and specialist NSW Police negotiators.

Police are in the early stages of investigating the full circumstances of the incident and there are no further details.
