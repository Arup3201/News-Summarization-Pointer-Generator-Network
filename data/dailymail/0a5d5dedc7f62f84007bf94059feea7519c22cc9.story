A woman has failed in a legal bid to stop her two-year-old son being adopted by Christians because they are not a 'religious match'.

The woman - believed to be Muslim - had tried to overturn a Newcastle judge's order that the little boy should be placed for adoption.

She argued that a relative should be allowed to care for him. But  following a family court hearing in Newcastle-upon-Tyne Judge Simon Wood blocked her attempts.

Details of the case have been published in a written ruling by the judge on a legal website.

The judge did not say what religion the woman or her ex-husband were - although indications in his ruling suggested that the family was Muslim.

He said he had made an order placing the little boy for adoption 13 months ago, and that social workers had matched the little boy with a Christian couple - who had been Muslims before converting.

The woman had applied to revoke the adoption placement order - and the judge said the 'lack of religious match' issue had been raised.

But he dismissed the woman's application, saying that it might not be possible to find a 'perfect' adoptive family for the youngster.

And he said 'religion' would not 'trump' other 'positive' factors.

The little boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons -  had been exposed to 'volatile and violent behaviour' and had been 'emotionally abused' by his parents. 

He said he had made an order placing the little boy for adoption 13 months ago, and that Newcastle social workers had matched the little boy with a Christian couple - who had been Muslims before converting. Pictured is Newcastle civic council 

He said the child had been provided with 'seriously sub-standard parenting'.

Assessments by social services staff had ruled out either parent as a carer, said the judge, and social workers had also assessed more than a dozen other family members as possible carers - but ruled all of them out.

Neither the woman, the little boy or the local authority which had begun care proceedings were identified.

But he said family members in Bristol, Leicester, Luton, Bedfordshire and the North East had been assessed. He said one relative lived in South Shields, Tyne and Wear.

One family member had not attended court because he was 'at Mecca', said the judge.

'(The little boy) has ... been formally matched with a couple who are said to be practising Christians, having converted from Islam,' said Judge Wood.

'That lack of religious match is something that is raised before me.'

He said a 'perfect match may be unachievable' and added: 'Culture in its widest sense, but also including religion, was but one factor that would not trump other factors if they were all positive.'
