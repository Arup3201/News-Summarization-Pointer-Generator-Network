Every cat owner likes to think they share a special bond with their feline friend, but experts believe that many people might be missing the chance to communicate effectively.

Britain's leading cat charity has produced a video guide to cat behaviour after a study found many owners struggle to understand their pet.

The Cats Protection video dispels popular myths such as cats licking their lips when they are hungry or wanting their tummies scratched when they roll over.

Three quarters of cat owners polled by the Cats Protection charity did not know an upright tail means a moggy is pleased to see them and is trying to say hello

Animal lovers are often at a loss to explain why their cat extends its tail upwards or rubs against them.

Three quarters of cat owners did not know an upright tail means a moggy is pleased to see them and is trying to say hello, while one in three thought a cat lies on its back when it wants its tummy tickled like a dog.

In fact, it actually means cats are relaxed and trust you - and want their head rubbed briefly instead.

Cat behaviour expert Nicky Trevorrow, 
who works at the charity, said it is likely that owners may be being 
scratched and bitten when they try to rub their cat's tummy - but cats see
 the action as an abuse of the trust they are exhibiting and would 
rather have their heads stroked.

A third of owners thought their cat lies on its back when it wants its tummy tickled like a dog, but it actually means cats are relaxed and trust you - and want their head rubbed briefly instead

The charity's experts hope their 3 minute video guide will help people notice when their pet is happy or stressed.

A third of the 1,100 cat owners surveyed failed to recognise a slow-blinking cat shows a calm, contented moggy, while two in three think a purring cat is always a happy one, when it could actually mean they are in pain.

Four in ten puzzled owners did not realise a feline with flattened ears meant it is scared and in need of somewhere to hide.

Pulling a frightened cat out of a hiding place in order to "comfort it, could actually add to its stress, the guide reveals.

Cats blink slowly and then turn their heads to the side to show they trust you and are relaxed. Cat behaviour expert Nicky Trevorrow suggested copying the cat's actions to see it it returns your slow blink

It recommends instead making sure there is somewhere for the feline to hide or climb up high.

Half of owners were unaware cats also
 signal stress by licking their lips, with three in ten thinking it 
means a cat is hungry or has dry lips.

It can a sign of nausea or stress - as well as making sure their face is clean after a meal.

A quarter of owners think cats 
'intentionally' shed their hair to mark territory, when they actually 
leave their scent by rubbing against surfaces.

One in 20 people thought their cat was rubbing against furniture or walls because it had an itchy face.

According to Ms Trevorrow, cats rub against things - usually with their cheeks or sides of their bodies - to deposit scent.

It can look like affectionate behavior 
if they rub against your legs as you return home, but as well as being a
 form of greeting, the sneaky kitties think their owner smells aÂ  bit 
strange and are depositing their scent so the human smells familiar once
 more.

Ms Trevorrow admitted cats' subtle' facial expressions can be difficult to read.

'Unlike
 dogs and humans, cats have not evolved the complex facial muscles that 
allow them to make obvious expressions,' she said.

'They are more subtle and can be difficult to read, so owners also need to look for non-facial signals that can indicate how their cat is feeling.

'Many cat owners treat their pet like a human friend and think they are being kind when they lavish it with long, affectionate hugs.

'However, cats are quite solitary creatures and generally find this over the top - instead preferring frequent but brief attention.'

Ms Trevorrow said owners can simply take more notice of their cat's behaviour to work out if it is being sociable or wants some time alone.

Four in ten puzzled owners did not realise a feline with flattened ears meant it is scared and in need of somewhere to hide. Pulling a frightened cat out of a hiding place in order to comfort it, could actually add to its stress, the guide reveals

She said: 'Misreading these signals can lead to you distressing your cat or being scratched, even if you have its best intentions at heart.

'If you wish to calm your pet, you can look it in the eyes and blink slowly.

'They also like short, rubs on the head if you pick the right moment.'

There are thought to be around nine million cats in the UK, with one in five households owning at least one.
