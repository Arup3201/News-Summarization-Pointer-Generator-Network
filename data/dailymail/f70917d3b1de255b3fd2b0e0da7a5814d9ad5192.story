Northern Ireland midfielder Steven Davis admitted he could not have envisaged the ongoing strife Rangers would suffer as he prepared to return to Glasgow almost three years after leaving Ibrox.

Davis was sold by Rangers to Southampton in July 2012, just after they were relaunched in the Scottish Third Division following the club's liquidation crisis.

He returns to Glasgow for Northern Ireland's friendly against Scotland with his former club having come through more off-field drama and struggling to complete their journey back to the top flight of Scottish football.

Rangers' win at Hibernian on Sunday was only their second in 10 games and it inadvertently clinched the Scottish Championship title for Hearts as they battle to go up through the play-offs.

Davis has watched the drama unfold from Southampton and hopes the rise to power of Dave King and his allies, along with the arrival of Stuart McCall as manager, will get the club back on course.

'I think it's positive for the club,' the 30-year-old said. 'For any fan it's nice to see with people who obviously have the interest of the club at heart.

'Obviously we knew it was going to be a difficult period but I don't think anyone foresaw how hard it was going to be.

'I think Stuart McCall is going to be a really good appointment as well, it was nice to see them get that first win on Sunday. Hopefully they can build on that now and finish the season strongly.'

When asked whether he would consider a return to Ibrox one day, Davis said: 'In football you never know. I spent four and a half really good years there and I loved my time there.

'If the opportunity arose it would be something I would definitely have to consider. It was a great time.'

Davis and his team-mates face Scotland on Wednesday in preparation for their European Championship qualifier against Finland in Belfast on Sunday.

He added: 'I am delighted to be back. I have not really had the chance to come back up for a game of any magnitude so it's nice to be back up and get the chance to catch up with some familiar faces and get another chance to play at Hampden.

'I was lucky enough to play there quite a few times and had some success there so I'm looking forward to going back.

'It's a good friendly for both ourselves and Scotland. I expect the game to have a bit of an edge because both sets of players are used to playing against each other at various stages of their careers.

'The mentality of both sets of players is always to give 100 per cent and I think it's good preparation for the Finland game.'
