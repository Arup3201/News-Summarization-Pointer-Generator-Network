Two men have appeared in court accused of killing a chef who died after they allegedly wrapped him in clingfilm.

Richard Bowler and David Connor, both from Canterbury, are charged with unlawfully killing 47-year-old Alun Williams by wrapping him in clingfilm and plastics and subjecting him to 'at least the risk of self-harm.'

Mr Williams, who worked as a chef on P&O Ferries for more than 30 years, was found dead in a flat above a hairdressers' in Dover, Kent, on August 20 last year.

Bowler, 35, and Connor, 23, appeared at Canterbury Crown Court today as the trial got underway.

They are both charged with unlawful killing and the charge specifies that wrapping Mr Williams in clingfilm and plastics 'subjected him to bodily harm in the form of dehydration, overheating and stress to his cardiovascular system'.

It states that this was the 'substantial cause of his death'.

The defendants also face an alternative charge of manslaughter by gross negligence, which specifies that by wrapping him up they owed him a duty of care and failed to take reasonable steps to ensure he was safe and well.

Bowler appeared in court today dressed in a purple polo shirt and brown coat while Connor wore a dark jacket in the dock.

Prosecutor Ian Hope is expected to outline the Crown's case tomorrow morning but the jury has already been told it will involve details of gay websites, including Gaydar and Recon.

Bowler and Connor both deny the charges against them.

Forensic experts and police were called to the flat in Dover last August following reports Mr Williams had died

Mr Williams, who lived with his girlfriend in Shepherdswell, Kent, had been a chef at P&O Ferries for 30 years and prepared food for passengers on trips between Dover and Calais.

At the time of his death, Brian Rees, a spokesman for P&O, said: 'We were obviously desperately sad to hear of Alun's death.

'He was very well known, working for us a head chef, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.'

The trial is expected to last until December 22.
