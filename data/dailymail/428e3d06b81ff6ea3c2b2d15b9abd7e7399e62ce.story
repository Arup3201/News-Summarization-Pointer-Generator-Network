The number of women dying from ovarian cancer has fallen by a quarter in 20 years thanks to  earlier diagnosis and better treatment, say researchers.

And the length of time the women survived for also increased, especially amongst women aged between 40 and 60.

Ovarian cancer is known as the ‘silent killer’ because it is notoriously difficult to diagnose and is often detected only once it has spread to other organs. It remains the fifth most common form of cancer amongst women, with 6,500 cases diagnosed in Britain a year.

The number of women dying from ovarian cancer has fallen by a quarter in 20 years

Scientists from the National Cancer Intelligence Network compared data on mortality and survival from 1989 with the latest  figures from 2009.

They found that mortality rates had fallen from 11.9 per cent per 100,000 women in  1989 to 8.8 per cent in 2009 – a drop of 26 per cent.

And almost three quarters of sufferers survived for at least a year, with 44 per cent still alive five  years later.

In 1989, a little over half of patients lived beyond a year and only a third survived for five years.

The biggest improvements in survival rates occurred amongst 40 to 60-year-olds. Rates for those aged 45 to 49 rose almost 50 per cent in ten years, with 61 per cent living for at least a year.

Experts believe these women have responded particularly well to national awareness campaigns alerting them to the early warning signs of the disease.

This has coincided with improvements in care, with patients usually referred to specialised gynaecology centres run by highly experienced surgeons and consultants.

But the NCIN – which is funded by the Government and cancer charities to carry out research – found that survival rates have barely improved amongst the elderly. Only 24 per cent of over-85s lived for at least a year, compared with 23 per cent living this long in 1989.

Elderly women may also be less aware of the symptoms and unwilling to trouble their GP, even if they suspect something is wrong.

Lead author Andy Nordin, a consultant 
gynaecologist at East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust, 
said: ‘This drop in deaths may reflect improvements in detecting and 
treating the disease, such as improvements in scanning, surgery and 
chemotherapy treatments.

‘Additionally,
over the past decade, ovarian cancer patients throughout the UK have 
experienced better management due to organisation of ovarian cancer care
in specialist gynaecological cancer centres, planning of care by teams 
of cancer experts and specialist surgery by specially trained and 
accredited gynaecological oncologists.’

A number of charities have run awareness campaigns over the past decade alerting women to the warning signs of the disease, which include bloating, loss of appetite and severe pain.

Patients and GPs can often confuse these symptoms with irritable bowel syndrome or period pains.

The NHS is hoping to improve diagnosis rates and last year a £20 blood test capable of detecting the illness was made available to GPs for the first time.

Chris Carrigan, head of the NCIN, said: ‘As ovarian cancer can be very hard to diagnose and treat, this report was important to help us learn as much as we can about the numbers of women who develop the disease, how many survive and how many die.’
