Jennifer Lawrence's piercing blue eyes take center stage in the actress' latest Miss Dior campaign.

With bare make-up - her eyes highlighted only with subtle gold eyeshadow - the 23-year-old appears refreshingly all-natural in the new ads.

Wearing a cozy grey coat, her hair pulled back in a wind-swept bun and her lips touched up with a blush tint, the images mark Miss Lawrence's second campaign for the legendary fashion house.

In contrast, the Oscar-winning actress' debut Dior ad, released in February, was heavily criticized for being overly Photoshopped.

'Oh my God, I haven't seen this,' she exclaimed of her first Dior ads on the Oscars red carpet.

'I love Photoshop more than anything in the world,' she revealed. 'Of course it's Photoshop - people don't look like that.'

The actress, who appears heavily made-up on the September cover of Vogue, is known for her cheeky candidacy.

In an interview with the magazine, the actress admitted she foresaw her fame while growing up in Kentucky.

'I always knew that I was going to be

'I used to 
lie in bed and wonder: "Am I going to be a local TV person? Am I going 
to be a motivational speaker."

'It wasn't a vision. But as it's kind of happening, you have this buried understanding: Of course.'
