Fled: Amanda Berry called 911 seconds after she fled the Cleveland dungeon

The police dispatcher who spoke to kidnap victim Amanda Berry after she escaped from the Cleveland house of horrors is being investigated over claims he swore at the end of her 911 call.

The man has previously been criticized for failing to keep Miss Berry on the line or comfort her during her desperate call for help.

But now new allegations have been made that the dispatcher calls Miss Berry a 'f****** b****' just before hanging up.

It was Miss Berry's 911 call that led to the discovery of fellow kidnap victims Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight after she bravely escaped the house on Seymour Avenue.

The three women had been held captive at the house for about a decade where they were repeatedly raped and tortured.

Suspect Ariel Castro, 52, remains on suicide watch in custody as he faces preliminary charges of rape and kidnapping.

DNA tests showed Castro is the father of a six-year-old girl born to Miss Berry during her time in captivity.

She finally broke free with the help of a neighbor and raised the alarm.

The 911 dispatcher - one of the 
first people Miss Berry spoke to after her decade long captivity -  has come under fire for the way he handled the conversation with the clearly distressed 26-year-old.

Experts in the U.S. say a muffled sound at the end of the call is the dispatcher cursing at Miss Berry.

Audio forensic experts hired by Cleveland station 19 Action News believe swear words were used.

The dispatcher is now being investigated by Cleveland City Hall, according to reports.

Cleveland station WOIO has reported that the results from an investigation by a police forensic audio team were inconclusive.

One of the 19 Action News experts 
says the 'second work is b****', while the second believes the 
dispatcher said 'f****** b****'.

During the two-minute conversation, Miss Berry, is heard screaming down the phone: 'I've been kidnapped and I've been missing for 10 years, and I'm, I'm here, I'm free now.'

But multiple times the
dispatcher’s response was 'Talk to the police when they get there,' before asking the name of Miss 
Berry’s captor, as well as his age and ethnicity.

In the 911 call Miss Berry implores 
the dispatcher that she needs the police immediately, but she is told 
authorities will be sent as soon as a 'car becomes open.'

At one point when Miss Berry says 'I'm 
Amanda Berry. I've been on the news for the last 10 years,' the 
dispatcher replies 'I got that, dear.'

As Miss Berry becomes more frantic the dispatcher says 'The police are on their way; talk to them when they get there.' 

The dispatcher, whose identity has not been revealed, repeats again  'I told you they're on their way; talk to them when they get there, OK.'

Last month, Cleveland Department of Public Safety 
Director Martin Flask said police were dispatched and on scene in the 
west side neighborhood in less than two minutes.

'While the call-taker complied 
with policies and procedures which enabled a very fast response by 
police, we have noted some concerns which will be the focus of our 
review, including the call-taker’s failure to remain on the line with 
Ms. Berry until police arrived on scene.

'Please be assured that this matter will be investigated, and if necessary, appropriate corrective action taken.'

Miss Knight disappeared in 2002
when she was 21, Miss Berry was 16 when she vanished in 2003 and Miss 
DeJesus went missing about a year later when she was 14.
