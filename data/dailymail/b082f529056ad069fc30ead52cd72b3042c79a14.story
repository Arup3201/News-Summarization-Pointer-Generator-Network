Your underpants could soon be instantly produced with a revolutionary 3D printing process that could change the way clothes are made.

Manchester firm Tamicare says its Cosyflex process uses 3D printing in a new, faster way to create fabric.

To prove its potential, they are creating a range of 3D printed pants - and is even in talks with Victoria’s Secret to mass produce underwear for the lingerie giant.

Manchester firm Tamicare is in talks with Victoria's Secret (this season's lingerie, pictured) to mass produce underwear for the underwear giant 

The process is different to current 3D printing, where layers are built up to produce an object.

With
the pants printers, a spray nozzle creates layers of rubber-latex 
polymers and cotton fibres.

These layers are used to construct a pair of disposable underpants 
in less than three seconds.

The process is fully automated and can 
produce up to 10 million pairs of the underpants in a year.

Tamicare is run by designer Tamar Giloh.

Last month Giloh presented her technology at a textile conference in the U.S, which is where suppliers from Victoria's Secret heard of the plans.

A supplier for the lingerie firm then took a tour of Tamicare’s offices to see the technology - capable of printing a pair of the disposable underwear in three seconds - in action.

The process is fully automated and can 
produce up to 10 million pairs of the underpants in a year.

'A radical departure from traditional textile manufacturing techniques, Cosyflex's unique additive manufacturing method creates a next generation of textile that is so versatile,' Tamicare said.

'More versatile than any other textile manufacturing method to date, Cosyflex prints finished product designs, in just seconds.'

The firm’s first products will be aimed at women who experience particularly heavy menstrual flow, but the firm says its technology is well suited to sportswear, and also compression bandages.

Although the pants use natural latex and cotton, a variety of clothing can be produced, and the firm has experimented with silicon, polyurethane and teflon.

It has also tested a variety of textile fibres including cotton, viscose and polyamide.

Tamicare says its technology, latest product pictured, is well suited to sportwear, and also compression bandages. The say that they could produce up to 10 million pairs of knickers a year 

'So far we were approached by companies, both national and international leaders, in the hygiene industry, cosmetics, medical, sports and fashion, looking for business collaboration,' said Tamicare's CEO, Tamar Giloh

It can even produce breathable fabrics suited for sportswear.

The firm recently opened a new plant to produce the fabric.

'At this new site we are going to set up a mass production line for Cosyflex,' CEO Tamar Giloh told Innovation in Textiles.

'The new line, which we designed, is partially financed by a government grant.

'So far we were approached by companies, both national and international leaders, in the hygiene industry, cosmetics, medical, sports and fashion, looking for business collaboration,” she added.

The firm has been working on the technology since 2001 and the first 3D printed underwear is expected to go on sale in pharmacies in Israel next year.

More than 30 other startups have been in touch with Giloh since her conference talk in October.
