Found: Tia sharp's body was so badly decomposed she was identified from her dental records

The body of missing schoolgirl Tia Sharp was so badly
decomposed police identified her from her dental records.

Detectives struggled to formally identify the 12-year-old
after they discovered her in the sweltering loft of her grandmother's home.

The details emerged as an inquest opened into her death
at Croydon Coroner's Court in South London this morning.

Police have said
 a post moretem, completed this afternoon, failed to establish a cause 
of death, more than six days after she was found.

More tests are now ongoing to determine how the young girl died.

Coroner Dr Roy Palmer adjourned any further inquiries
until the criminal case concludes after a five minute hearing.

He said he would release Tia's body as soon as this
week's medical tests are completed.

However this could be delayed if Stuart Hazell, her
grandmother's lover, requests a second post mortem as part of his defence.

A police spokesman said: 'A full post-mortem at Croydon Mortuary has concluded.

'It did not establish a formal cause of death and we await the results of further tests.'

The suspect appeared at the Old Bailey yesterday via
video link from Belmarsh Prison accused of her murder.

Dr Palmer said: 'I understand that the body of a young
woman was found at an address in New Addington.

'I understand that it can now be confirmed that the body
has been positively identified and the body is that of Tia Sharp.

Det Sgt Eric Sword, who is part of the murder team,
confirmed that following 'tests' Tia had been identified.

He said: 'The examination in relation to the cause of
death remains ongoing, it remains under 
investigation.'

Police suspect Tia was smothered to death before her body
was wrapped in a black bed sheet, put in a bin bag and dumped in the loft.

Her disappearance triggered a huge search operation
involving more than 100 police officers and many more volunteers.

She was eventually found at the small terraced council
home of her grandmother, Christine Sharp, 46, in New Addington, near Croydon.

Suspect: The partner of Tia Sharp's grandmother Stuart Hazell, the last man said to have seen the 12-year-old schoolgirl alive, has been charged with her murder

Scotland Yard admitted that her body was missed during an
earlier search due to 'human error' and apologised to her mother Natalie, 31.

A senior officer suggested it may have been moved before
a dog trained to detect blood and decomposition eventually raised the alarm.

Hazell is the last person said to have seen Tia alive and claimed
she had gone to Croydon to buy flip-flops without her Oyster card or mobile
phone promising to be home by 6pm on August 3.

Police trawled through more than 800 hours of CCTV
footage and investigated 60 reported sightings and more than 300 calls cops but
find no trace of her leaving estate.

Police only discovered Tia’s body after 
several visits to the terraced property, and have apologised to her 
mother, Natalie Sharp, for the delay.

Mrs Sharp, who was arrested on suspicion of murder, and
her neighbour, Paul Meehan, 39, who was arrested on suspicion of assisting an
offender, have been released on bail until October.

Neighbours have warned that neither may be able to return
home because of the angry mood on the estate.A serious case review has been launched into Tia’s death by Merton Council, which has responsibility for Mitcham, south London, where Tia lived with her mother.
