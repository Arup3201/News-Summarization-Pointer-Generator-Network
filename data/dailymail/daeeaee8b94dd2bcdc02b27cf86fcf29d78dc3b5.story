At first glance, they look uncannily like a gallery of moody, hipster black and white pictures uploaded to the retro photo sharing site instagram.

In fact, they are a collection of 'raw' images from Nasa's Curiosity rover on the surface of Mars.

The unprocessed images have a grainy quality, due to the 'hidden' colour information within them - which is not revealed until they are processed by Nasa.

A 'raw' image from the Martian surface taken by the mastcam, a 2 megapixel camera on curiosity's mast. It may look like a mono image, but in fact has colour information encoded within it, giving it a grainy quality rather like an instagram picture

The same image, but processed to reveal the colour. Online enthusiasts were able to extract the colour information from the raw image.

The image can then be processed to alter its colour and make it look more presentable. Here, a final image has been created showing the martian landscape in colour.

Each Mastcam uses a filtered  camera sensor to capture images.

Known as a Bayer Pattern Filter CCD, it provides nearly true color views - that is, similar to what the human eye would see on Mars.

Using this approach eliminates the usual need for planetary spacecraft cameras to take 3 separate images - one through a red filter, one through a green filter, and one through a blue filter.

The CCD captures the image using the pattern below:

While Nasa only generally publicises
'hero' images that show off stunning new features or amazing colour 
panoramas, it has also quietly been publishing every single image from
the rover's multiple cameras online, giving a far more accurate view of
the red planet - which, it seems, it actually a rather dull place - 
until the colour information is extracted.

Although Nasa does not publish details of how it encodes the images, online enthusiasts at unmannedspaceflight.com have worked it out, and are busy decoding images.

These images are taken by Curiosity mastcams, and are usually used by engineers and drivers on Earth to check the rover is going in the right direction.

Roberty
Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society explains that many of the 
images we see from Mars use false colours to highlight key areas.

'True colour images are fairly rare, 
and as anyone who has looked at Mars through a telescope knows, it is an
orangey red colour,' he said.

'However, there really isn't a huge 
diversity of colour there - and it really resembles a barren desert, and
a very harsh environment'

They are also used to look for potential sites for the rover to investigate.

One of the two Mastcam camera systems
has a moderate-resolution lens, while the other camera system has a 
high-resolution lens in order to study the landscape far from the rover.

In fact, even Curiosity's high resolution camera is poor compared to modern cameras and even phones.

A two megapixel unit, it was chosen to permit Curiosity to store and transmit images in good time.

Curiosity
sends data to two satellites currently orbiting Mars -- the former Mars
Reconnaissance and Mars Odyssey orbiters -- which then transmit data 
back to Earth.

But at a speed of only 128Kbps, it's still quite slow in modern terms - and explains the grainy, retro pictures sent back.

As well as the retro images, Curiosity also sends back small 'thumbnail' images, often in basic, unencoded colour, which show engineers what the camera is focused on before they decide whether to take a higher resolution photo.

Hipsters on Mars: Curiosity's latest images may lack the high resolution of its PR shots, but they give the red planet a decidedly retro feel.

The images also reveal fascinating rocks on the martian surface, including this triangular one dubbed 'shark rock'

The images, all taken from Curiosity's mastcam, are used by engineers to study the rover's surroundings as it moves around the red planet.

Nasa provides no information about images, but does claim to publish every single picture from the red planet of a special curiosity images feed.

The low resolution pictures have a grainy quality probably caused by martian dust, and slight distortion at the edges due to the relatively low quality lenses on the rover.

The images reveal the sweeping beauty of the Martian surface, but also help controllers look for possible areas for Curiosity to go and visit.
