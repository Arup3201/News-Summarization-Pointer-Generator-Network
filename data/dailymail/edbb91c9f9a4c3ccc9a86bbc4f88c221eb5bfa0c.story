Nigel Farage yesterday effectively ruled out a pact with the Conservatives as he battled to stop the ‘sluts’ row from completely overshadowing his annual party conference.

The UKIP leader tried to move on from the furore over MEP Godfrey Bloom’s ourburst by outlining his determination  to remain independent.

But his efforts were undermined when The Mail on Sunday established that  Mr Farage shares a Brussels flat with Mr Bloom.

The two men have claimed more than £100,000 in expenses on the property since 2009.

A spokesman for Mr Farage said he would continue to share the flat with Mr Bloom – in which Mr Farage ‘agreed to take the smaller room’ – even though he has suspended  Mr Bloom from the party.

Asked whether Mr Farage would kick Mr Bloom out of the flat, a UKIP spokesman said: ‘No. Nigel and Godfrey go back a very long way.’

He did not say whether either man cleaned behind the fridge.

Mr Farage said it was ‘extremely unlikely’ UKIP would form an electoral pact with the Tories. He said: ‘We’re our own party with our own agenda.’

UKIP found itself at the centre of a political storm after Mr Bloom called a group of women ‘sluts’ and hitting a journalist over the head.

Mr Farage said his former flatmate had ‘destroyed’ Ukip’s annual conference – where he told activists they could hold the balance of power at Westminster after the next election.

year's European elections

Mr Bloom, whose track record of outbursts includes comments about Britain giving  foreign aid to ‘Bongo Bongo land’, was hosting a conference fringe meeting to promote ‘Women in Politics’.

The event was attended by a number of prominent activists, including Mr Farage’s wife Kirsten.

When one female Ukip activist joked that she did not have time to ‘clean behind the fridge’ – a reference to Mr Bloom’s claim that women should spend more time cleaning – Mr Bloom turned to his wife and said: ‘Don’t listen to this, dear.’

After a second woman then made the same joke, Mr Bloom declared loudly: ‘The room is full of sluts!’

Minutes later he launched into a rant outside, which ended with him hitting Channel Four News reporter Michael Crick over the head with a copy of the Ukip conference programme.

An unrepentant Mr Bloom, who later delivered his conference speech on defence policy, said he had made a ‘purposely outrageous joke among friends which was taken as joke by women present’.

He said he had used the term in its old-fashioned sense of a slattern – a dirty or untidy woman – rather than its modern reference to promiscuity.

It comes barely a month after Mr Bloom's complaint that UK aid money was being sent to ‘Bongo Bongo Land’.

In the wake of the latest outburst, Mr Farage told Sky News: 'My opinion is Godfrey has gone beyond the pale.

'He's a friend of mine and I'm sorry to say it but he has gone beyond the pale and I think we have no option but to remove the whip from him. Personally I have had enough of it.'

To add to the embarrassment an article emerged from 2006 in which Mr Bloom confessed to visiting brothels and said most prostitutes 'do it because they want to'.

Challenged by reporters outside the event, Mr Bloom defended the extraordinary remark: ‘I made a joke and said “oh well you're all sluts” and everybody laughed and all the women laughed.

‘Was there a single women in there who didn't laugh at the joke?,' he told Sky News.

He then called Sky News reporter Darren McCaffrey a ‘sad little man’.

As he made his way down the street in Westminster, Mr Bloom was then accosted by Michael Crick from Channel 4 News about the fact that a party brochure featured only white faces.

He replied: ‘What a racist comment. How dare you, that's an appalling thing to say, you're picking people out for the colour of their skin? You disgust me.’He then took the brochure and hit Mr Crick over the head with it.

He later wrote on Twitter: 'It shd not b [sic] taken out of context & misrepresented by a hostile press.

'Made a purposely outrageous joke among friends which was taken as joke by women present.'

The bizarre behaviour overshadowed the UKIP conference, where Mr Farage tried to play down the idea that the party was damaged by outbursts by senior figures.

He accused Mr Bloom of 'destroying' the conference and that could not be tolerated.
