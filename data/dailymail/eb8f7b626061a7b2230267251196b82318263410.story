An Episcopal priest who was born a woman but is now living as a straight man is the first transgender clergy to give a sermon at the National Cathedral.

The Reverend Dr Cameron Partridge, the Episcopal chaplain at Boston University, offered a sermon from the iconic Canterbury Pulpit as part of the church's celebration of LGBT pride month.

In the sermon, he said gay, lesbian and transgender people can be so consumed by despair and oppression that they fail to see the love of Jesus.Â

The sermon Sunday focused on LGBT issues and faith, especially the trouble that many transgender people face as they are deciding to change their gender, he said

Rev Partridge was joined at the pulpit by the Right Reverend Gene Robinson, the first openly gay Episcopal bishop.

The Very Rev. Gary Hall, dean of the cathedral, says he hopes Partridge's appearance 'will send a symbolic message in support of greater equality for the transgender community.'

Rev Partridge encouraged gay and transgender people to look for resilience and strength in Christianity.

'So many people in the LGBTQ community, and particularly in the trans community, have at one point or another or for a lifetime found ourselves in situations of intense oppression, isolation and despair,' he said, according to the Washington Times.

'We have been utterly unable to see beyond the horizon of our often multiple, intersectional margins.'

The National Cathedral, one of the most iconic churches in the United States - and the second largest - was built between 1907 and 1910

Rev Cameron Partridge was born Katherine. She came out as lesbian while attending the all-women Bryn Mawr College.

Later, after graduating from Harvard Divinity School, she began the process of transitioning from female to male. He completed the process in 2001.

Rev Partridge's female partner, who was with him when he was a woman, has stuck by his side.

They are now living as a straight couple with two young children in suburban Boston.
