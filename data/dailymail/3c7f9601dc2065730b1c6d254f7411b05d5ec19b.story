Scientists claim to have to found an effective method for tackling the age-old school nightmare of 'mean girls' behavior.

According to researchers at the University of Missouri, 'relational aggression ' - forms of non-physical bullying such as gossiping, rumor spreading, exclusion and rejection - can be reduced using an intervention strategy they've dubbed Growing Interpersonal Relationships through Learning and Systemic Supports (GIRLSS).

Tested on 30 girls aged between 12 and 15, the ten-week program involved group counseling, role-playing, journaling and weekly goal setting, and was found overall to decrease relational aggression.

You can't sit with us: In a new program developed by the University of Missouri, teens and their caregivers were given weekly social exercises which decreased 'mean girls' bullying of the non-physical variety  

As part of the intervention method, students took park in one 70-minute session a week where they participated in a range of discussions and exercises.

In addition, the girls' caregivers attended separate workshops and bi-weekly phone consultations during which they were taught better monitoring and supervision skills.

A range of 'appropriate disciplinary responses' for dealing with mean girl-esque behavior were also suggested.

According to Melissa Maras, co-author of the study and assistant professor in the Department of Educational, School and Counseling Psychology at the university, parents and teachers should keep their eyes open for relational aggression, so they don’t 'unknowingly contribute to the negative behaviors.'

Statistically, teenage boys are twice as likely to bully as teenage girls, or at least twice as likely to be reported for bullying.

It is widely speculated, however, that boys, who tend to be more overt and physical in their approach, are simply more easily detected than 'mean girls' who display relational aggression.

'This study represents a first step in helping school personnel meet the intervention needs of a diverse group of relationally aggressive girls,' Dr Maras said.

Co-author Connie Brooks, also an assistant professor, added: 'Good outcomes can happen when priorities are set by schools and families to prevent and eliminate relational aggression.'

Indeed, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, bullying stops in ten seconds, 57per cent of the time ,when an adult or fellow student immediately intervenes. 

Researchers at the University of Missouri now hope to expand the GIRLSS program into more schools in a bid to manage what is a pretty universal, if sometimes overlooked, part of the nature of teenage girls.
