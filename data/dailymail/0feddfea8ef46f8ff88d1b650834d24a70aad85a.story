A 41-year-old stargazer was today celebrating an astronomical £1million Lottery win.

Paul Turton, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, vowed to use his winnings to buy a new house and a bigger telescope.

Mr Turton, who lives with his parents, won the jackpot in the special EuroMillions Millionaire Raffle draw on November 25.

Speaking about his lottery win today, Mr Turton said: 'I couldn't believe it when I saw my raffle number come up. I kept saying to myself 'I think I've won, I think I've won', but it was only after I had double-checked a couple of sources and told my mum that, I thought I best phone Camelot.

'It has felt like a bit of a fantasy until now but the news has finally sunk in. It's a lovely surprise ahead of Christmas. The win means that I won't have to worry about anything anymore and my parents and I can be secure.'

Amateur astronomer Mr Turton, who works in the non-food section at Waitrose supermarket, said he was delighted he would finally be able to get on to the property ladder and had already started looking on the internet for a new house.

He said he might also treat himself to a new telescope despite having just bought one.

'It's only a small one but I may upsize when I buy my new place', he said.

Mr Turton said he would also buy a new plasma television, some treats for his parents at Christmas and hoped he would now be able to spend more time in Melbourne, Australia, where his older sister and niece live.

The 41-year-old bought two tickets for the draw from GT News, in Sheffield, before returning to the shop to buy two more.

He said: 'I've been playing The National Lottery since it began and I usually have a couple of Lotto lines but very occasionally play EuroMillions.

'I finished work and bought a couple of tickets and then something spurred me on to go back and buy a couple more.'

Mr Turton was one of 18 £1million winners in a draw which marked the start of The National Lottery's Millionaires Month, which continues until December 23, with draws taking place every Tuesday and Friday.
