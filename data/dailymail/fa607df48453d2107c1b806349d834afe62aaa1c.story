Margaret Thatcher would be ‘appalled’ at Tories switching to the UK Independence Party, one of her closest allies has said.

Former defence secretary Liam Fox warned that Conservatives flirting with the Eurosceptic party will simply open the door to another Labour government.

In an outspoken address to the Midlands Industrial Council, Dr Fox warned that Tory politicians should remind the public of Lady Thatcher’s belief that countries shouldn’t spend more than they earn.

Former Defence Secretary Dr Liam Fox claims Baroness Thatcher would be appalled by Conservatives defecting to the UK Independence Party

The Thatcherite flagbearer spoke out after UKIP leader Nigel Farage claimed earlier this week that if Lady Thatcher were entering politics today she would join his party.

Dr Fox said: ‘Lady Thatcher used to say that she was born a Conservative, would die a Conservative and would fight for her beliefs inside the Conservative Party.

‘I think she would be disappointed, if not appalled, to see Conservatives switching to UKIP rather than argue their case inside the Conservative Party.

‘But worse, she would be horrified to think that such switching could open the door to power locally and nationally to her mortal enemy, the Labour Party.’

Dr Fox spoke out as UKIP faced embarrassment as it was revealed that one of its local election candidates was a member of the far-right BNP and another blamed Jews for the Holocaust.

 candidate Anna-Marie Crampton is alleged to have said World War Two was
 engineered by Zionists and bankers to create the state of Israel

Anna-Marie Crampton the Ukip candidate in Crowborough, East Sussex, was suspended after it was revealed that she has claimed the Second World War was financed by Jewish bankers to help create the state of Israel. She said: ‘It was thanks to them that six million Jews were murdered in the war’.

Crampton also encouraged followers to read the Protocols of Zion, a forged anti-Semitic hoax that claims the world is run by a worldwide Jewish conspiracy.

Susan Bowen, from Boscastle in Cornwall, was earlier thrown out of the party when it emerged she was in the BNP.

Mr Farage yesterday admitted that ‘one or two’ of his party’s candidates in the local elections could be members of the BNP or have criminal records and conceded that candidates that he would ‘rather not have had’ standing in the elections may have ‘slipped through the net’.

Dr Fox used a speech to business leaders in Birmingham to argue the Tory party can win an overall majority in 2015 provided it shows ‘political courage’ and ‘intellectual creativity’.

But he warned the Conservatives had lost touch with many of the people who had voted for Lady Thatcher.

‘Many people in this country will also have been reminded why they were drawn to the Conservative cause under Margaret Thatcher's leadership,’ he will said.

‘Their values have not changed and neither have ours but we are currently lacking the language to reconnect with them. We are their natural home and they are our natural supporters regardless of what background or part of the country they come.’

Although he does not directly criticise David Cameron, his speech will be seen as offering the party a radical alternative vision for the next election.

Despite the reforms of the coalition, he said the country remained ‘over-taxed, over-regulated’ and still spent too much and borrowed too much.

The Conservatives now need to come forward with a programme which rewarded risk-takers and fostered a climate where wealth creation was encouraged.

He calls for a public spending freeze for at least three years, and a ‘systematic switching’ of universal benefits into tax cuts.

There is ‘instinctive support’ among Conservatives, he will say, for reform of inheritance tax, which the Tories promised at the last election but dropped in the coalition negotiations with the Liberal Democrats.

‘We must end the iniquitous multi-taxing of the same money,’ Dr Fox added.

‘It is not right to tax people's income and then their savings on that income; to tax the movement of assets through capital gains tax and stamp duty, and then tax them again through inheritance tax if they have the audacity to die.’

Assets sales he suggests could include Network Rail, Channel 4, and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland water industries, as well as the Government's stakes in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds.

There should also be a rethink of the size and structure of Whitehall and the Civil Service, as well as a radical programme of deregulation.

‘I believe it is entirely possible for the Conservative party to win an overall majority at the next general election if we show political courage, intellectual creativity and party unity,’ he added

‘Those of us who were drawn to the Conservative Party by Margaret Thatcher's desire to free people from the pigeon holes that they had historically been put into, able to exploit their own talents in a country that valued opportunity, creativity and hard work, have a duty to make that message heard in the next generation as well.’

In an apparent side-swipe at Mr Cameron's Old Etonian background, he emphasised Lady Thatcher's appeal across the class divide, saying that, as the grandson of a miner, it was ‘unimaginable’ that he could have been attracted to the party before she became leader.

‘She powered into a meritocratic era, determined to ensure that wealth and ownership were not the preserve of a privileged few,’ he said.
