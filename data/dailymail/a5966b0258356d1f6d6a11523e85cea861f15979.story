Four men charged with the fatal carjacking of a young lawyer at an upscale New Jersey mall today pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges.

Hanif Thompson, 29, Karif Ford, 31, Basim Henry, 32, and Kevin Roberts, 33, are accused of shooting Dustin Friedland outside The Mall at Short Hills on December 15.

Authorities say the 30-year-old lawyer from Hoboken was killed in front of his wife Jamie after they returned to his car in the mall parking garage following a shopping trip.

The four men were arraigned on charges of murder, felony murder, carjacking, conspiracy, possession of a weapon and possession of a weapon for unlawful purpose on Wednesday.

Charged: Basin Henry, 32, left, and Karif Ford, 31, right, also pleaded not guilty to the charges on Wednesday

Their public defenders entered not-guilty pleas for the men, who have been in custody since their arrests about a week after the shooting.

A state Superior Court judge in Newark continued their bail at $2 million each.

The carjackers confronted the pair and Friedland was shot in the head, authorities said. His wife was unharmed.

The
 assailants drove off in the couple's silver Range Rover, which was 
found the next morning in Newark, about 10 miles from Short Hills. 

Prosecutors have said the couple were targeted solely because of the make of their vehicle.

Court
 documents released last month said the four were caught on surveillance
 video arriving at the scene in Henry's mother's Subaru SUV which helped
 inveistgators track down the suspects.

Happier times: The young couple were attacked after leaving a shopping trip on December 15

Accused: Thompson appears with the 3 other men for an arraignment at Essex County Superior Court

Nonchalant: Ford and the other three men were charged with murder and carjacking, among other charges

The
 four men face charges of murder, felony murder, carjacking, conspiracy,
 possession of a weapon and possession of a weapon for unlawful purpose.

They have been in custody on $2million bail each since their arrests about a week after the incident.

It
 was not immediately clear who would be representing them at their 
arraignments this morning in state Superior Court in Newark.

Acting
 Essex County Prosecutor Carolyn Murray said the 'sheer senselessness' 
of the crime outraged residents and lead to tips pouring in from across 
Essex County, whose borders encompass crime-plagued Newark to the east 
and Short Hills and other affluent suburbs to the west.

At Mr Friedland's funeral last month,
 his 27-year-widow said: ‘Dustin was the most chivalrous person. He 
would run to make sure he opened for car door for me.

Friedman's silver Range Rover was recovered in Newark the morning after the attack on December 15

'There wasn’t a bag anyone ever carried that Dustin didn’t help with.’

'He wasn't here [with us] long enough, but he did so much while he was,' she said. 'I was lucky to be with him for his forever.'

The
 couple met while studying at Syracuse University. Mr Friedland gained a
 law degree and worked as a project manager for his family's heat and 
air conditioning company.

They married in 2011 and had dreamed of starting a family together.

Torn apart: Dustin Friedland, 30, was returning with his wife Jamie to their Range Rover after a Sunday night shopping spree when he was fatally shot

Heartbroken: Grieving widow Jamie Schare Friedland buried her
 husband just days after he was fatally shot in front of her, and said: 'I couldn't have asked for a better or more loving husband'
