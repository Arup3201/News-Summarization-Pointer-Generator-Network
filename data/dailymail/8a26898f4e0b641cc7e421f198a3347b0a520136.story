Zlatan Ibrahimovic was fortunate to escape a red card on his 100th appearance for Sweden after he floored Austria defender David Alaba.

The PSG striker caught Bayern Munich left back Alaba in the face with a flailing elbow in the first half of Monday's Euro 2016 qualifier in Vienna.

Naughty: Ibrahimovic was booked by Czech referee Pavel Kralovec for foul on Martin Harnik

Ibrahimovic escaped punishment for the reckless challenge when referee Pavel Kralovec could have brandished a red card.

Two minutes later the Czech official did reach in his pocket to show the Swede a yellow card for a lunge at Martin Harnik.

Ibrahimovic was well marked by the Austria defence and he was clearly unimpressed by the close attention in particular from Rubin Okotie.

'You saw another side of Zlatan today because he was working really hard for the team,' Sweden coach Erik Hamren said. 

'I am happy with the result, I am also happy with the game ... I am sure it's going to be a really important point in qualifying.' 

Alaba gave Austria the lead  from the penalty spot after Sebastian Larsson blocked an attempted cross from the Austria midfielder with his arm.
