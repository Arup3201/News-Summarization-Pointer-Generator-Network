A drug dealer has been jailed for five years for possessing a dangerous stun gun disguised as a mobile phone, according to police.

Officers discovered the weapon, which is capable of discharging 50,000 volts, while searching the home of Wesley Walters in Southampton, Hampshire.

The potentially lethal device - designed to look like the Sony Ericsson K95 - is as powerful as a standard-issue police Taser.

The 26-year-old had been arrested hours earlier after supplying four wraps of heroin to an undercover officer ass part of Operation Fortress, a police campaign to clamp down on serious violent crime linked to drugs in Southampton.

Police raided drug dealer Wesley Walter's home and found a 50,000 volt stun gun disguised as a mobile phone hidden in a wardrobe. The potentially lethal device  is as powerful as a standard-issue police Taser

They also discovered a police-style metal baton.

A Hampshire police spokesman said: 'When detectives searched his flat on Rampart Road they found the firearm disguised as a mobile phone in the back of a drawer.

'The weapon, which was capable of discharging 50,000 volts, will be destroyed.'

Detective Constable Simon Woods said: 'We targeted Walters’ home after he sold heroin on two occasions to an undercover officer in March.'

Shocking: Officers discovered the weapon, which is capable of discharging 50,000 volts, in a cupboard at his home

He added: At court he claimed the stun gun was bought as a novelty item. He said he’d misplaced the charger and had put the weapon at the back of the drawer and hadn’t used it since.

'Even so, he had access to a dangerous weapon which still held a charge and was capable of delivering a very powerful blow.'

The Chinese-manufactured Kelin 95 is illegal in this country but widely available on the internet for just £20.

When a button on the side is pressed, the powerful electrical charge can stun an opponent into submission.

More and more criminals are buying the weapons and some models can discharge far higher - and potentially fatal - charges.

It is marketed as a self defence device for law enforcement, security guards and civilians.

He added: 'We also found in his flat a police-style
 metal baton. It’s unusual for a member of the public to have one in 
their possession but because it was in a private place, no offence was 
committed

'It too will be securely disposed of.'

Walters pleaded guilty at Southampton Crown Court on Tuesday to possessing a section 5 firearm, for which he was jailed for five years, and two counts of supplying heroin, for which he was jailed for three years and six months to run concurrently.

The court heard that Walters had committed more than 20 previous offences, including inflicting grievous bodily harm, possessing an offensive weapon, assault and affray.

DC Woods continued: 'The warrants we carried out as part of Operation Fortress were designed to demonstrate that Southampton is a hostile place for anyone coming here to deal drugs and commit acts of violence.

'At the same time, the campaign is finding long term solutions to helping to reduce the demand for drugs.'
