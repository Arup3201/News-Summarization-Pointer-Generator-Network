The cost of the Welfare State has risen 12-fold in real terms since its introduction, figures reveal today – as George Osborne prepares to unveil a benefits freeze.

Figures released by the Department for Work and Pensions to mark the 70th anniversary of William Beveridge’s landmark report on welfare, show the cost of the modern system dwarfs that of his original vision.

They come as the Chancellor puts the finishing touches to next week’s Autumn Statement on the economy, when he is expected to announce a freeze in the value of most benefits apart from pensions and disability payments.

The move is part of Mr Osborne’s drive to tackle Britain’s budget deficit. He is also expected to ease pressure on family budgets by cancelling the 3p rise in fuel duty due to come in next month.

The new figures reveal that benefit spending has increased dramatically since Beveridge’s proposals were introduced in 1948, rising from the equivalent of £13.5billion in today’s prices to £165.5billion this year – more than a 12-fold increase.

Even given the huge growth in the economy over the past seven decades, the increase in the cost of the benefits system has been dramatic.

In 1948 spending on benefits accounted for 10.4 per cent of Britain’s total income, against 24.2 per cent this year.

Lost vision: Iain Duncan Smith believes the current system is no longer in touch with the Beveridge report's original idea of the Welfare State

Jobseeker’s Allowance has almost doubled in real terms from £37.30 a week for the 1948 unemployment benefit to £71 today. At the same time the basic state pension has almost trebled from £37.30 to £107.45.

Yet over the same period the price of a pint of milk has fallen in real terms from 57p to 46p.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain 
Duncan Smith said the soaring cost underlined the fact that the welfare 
system had lost touch with Beveridge’s original vision of ensuring 
‘freedom from want’.

‘Beveridge’s pioneering vision for welfare has been completely lost,’ he said. ‘The system is complicated, expensive and open to abuse.

‘Our reforms will restore confidence and bring the benefits system back to Beveridge’s founding principles.

‘We will deliver his vision of a Welfare State that provides a safety net for those who need it, without stifling incentive, opportunity or responsibility.’

In October, Mr Duncan Smith said that spending on benefits and tax credits had risen by more than 60 per cent under the previous Labour government – spiralling even before the recession, when growth was booming, jobs were being created, and welfare bills should have been falling.

By 2010, the extra spending was costing every household in the country an extra £3,000 a year in tax, helping to increase the budget deficit..
