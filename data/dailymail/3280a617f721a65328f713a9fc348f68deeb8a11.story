An idyllic sun-kissed cricket ground on the south coast of England could hardly have felt further away from a conflict so bitter and entrenched it is almost impossible to pass comment without being branded either sympathiser or extremist.

But, through the action of a British-born Muslim wearing two bracelets proclaiming ‘Save Gaza’ and ‘Free Palestine’ on his left wrist, the consciousness of an audience of cricket fans was pricked on Monday.

While Moeen Ali received a smack on the wristband from the ICC and former England fast bowler Steve Harmison toed the ‘sport and politics don’t mix’ line, few others in Southampton appeared outraged.

Agree or disagree, many were 
encouraged that a sportsman — who proclaims himself ‘proud to be British
 and proud to be Muslim’ — should have the moral courage to make a 
statement in a world where media-control is king.

Moeen
 is the antithesis of the modern sportsmen so often criticised for being
 vacuous. While they spout cliches and only seem to care about sport and
 material possessions, this man is different.

He
 is intelligent and aware of what’s going on in the world. In a recent 
interview with this newspaper, he said: ‘Religion is very important to 
me. One of my aims is to try to show that you can have faith and play 
cricket. There can be a lot of negativity and misunderstanding of Islam.

‘I feel my job as a Muslim
 is to change that and show people what my faith is really like. A lot 
of what is said and written is ridiculous, but that’s life. I just get 
on with it and try to be as positive as I can.’

From
 the response of the majority in cricket on Tuesday, it seems there is a
 significant difference between Moeen backing charities looking to 
provide humanitarian support in a war zone and Nicolas Anelka’s cynical 
use of the ‘quenelle’  gesture — an overtly anti-Semitic sign — and the 
ECB had the good sense to recognise this.

England’s
 cricketers all wore shirts with a message of support for Help for 
Heroes on Tuesday as part of the commemoration of the 100th anniversary 
of the start of the First World War.

‘Part
 of the reason we went to war in places like Iraq was to fight for 
things like freedom of speech,’ said Corporal Neil Heritage, who lost 
both his legs in a suicide bomb attack in Iraq in 2004 and has been 
supported by Help for Heroes since.

‘I have no problem with a sportsman or woman making a political statement.’

The
 ICC’s high-handed diktat that he must remove his wristbands will do 
little to stop other like-minded cricketers following Moeen’s lead.

‘If
 I was Moeen, I wouldn’t mind getting fined if people realise what’s 
going on and one life is saved,’ said former Pakistan and current Surrey
 all-rounder Azhar Mahmood.

‘All we can do is make people aware. I can wear the band and if I can 
find one I will wear it in Saturday’s Twenty20 quarter final (against 
Worcestershire).’

Harmison 
said: ‘He’s been a silly boy,’ and there will of course be those who ask
 — where do we draw the line? Next week will Joe Root’s bat be branded 
with ‘Boycott Russia’?

There
 will always be those, like Harmison, who don’t want sport and politics 
to cross over. Why would they? It is complicated and uncomfortable, 
distracting from ‘important’ things like the rough outside off stump or 
who will bat at six.

Then 
there are others, like Moeen and countless more before him, who think 
deeply and understand they are role models in their community.Some would
 say they understand leadership. Like it, or hate it, sport and politics
 always have, and always will, mix.
