It's been a tricky start to the year for Bayern Munich, but after defeating Stuttgart to win their first game of 2015, the German giants celebrated - Western style!

A whole host of first-team players attended Ana Ivanovic's costume party, who is the girlfriend of Bayern midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, at the Cafe Reitschule in Munich.

Most of the players from the Bundesliga giants arrived looking like extras from 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, but Javi Martinez showed he was thinking outside the box after turning up dressed as Woody from Toy Story.

Robert Lewandowski and Mario Gotze were also among those in attendance, with Lewandowski pictured with his wife, Anna, while Gotze was seen with lingerie model girlfriend Ann-Kathrin Brommel.

Lewandowski and Gotze had earlier played the full 90 minutes as Bayern Munich picked up their first victory since the winter break to defeat Stuttgart 2-0 at the Mercedes-Benz Arena.

Goals either side of half-time from Arjen Robben and David Alaba sealed the win which helped Bayern get back on track in the Bundesliga.

The result comes after Munich began the year with a shock 4-1 loss against title rivals Wolfsburg - their first defeat of the season - before following up with a 1-1 draw against Schalke.

Bayern now top the table by eight points as they aim to retain the German title.
