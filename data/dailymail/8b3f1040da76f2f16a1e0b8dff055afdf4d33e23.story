A Tory councillor posted a  picture showing a line-up of scantily clad women on Twitter – and compared it to the all-women shortlist used to choose a local Labour candidate.

Richard Davies has been forced to apologise for the photograph of eight women in lingerie, which he posted with the caption: ‘Actual photo of  the hustings?’

The Lincolnshire County councillor and local party chief sent the post, which has since been deleted, to six local politicians including Lincoln MP Karl McCartney.

Offensive? Richard Davies tweeted this photograph of women in underwear to Lincoln MP, Karl McCartney

The Lincolnshire county councillor apologised after Labour candidate Lucy Rigby, 31, said his tweet was sexist

Inner circle: Miss Rigby was selected to fight the seat of Lincoln at next year's General Election

Labour
 uses all-women shortlists in an attempt to narrow the parliamentary 
gender gap. However, critics say that  the policy is patronising to 
women and  discriminatory to men.

The
 controversial process was used  to select solicitor Lucy Rigby as 
Labour’s parliamentary candidate for the marginal seat of Lincoln in 
2012.

Mother-of-one Miss 
Rigby saw the  public post on the social networking site and retweeted 
it to her 4,870 followers. She said: ‘Here’s Karl McCartney MP & 
Tory Cllr discussing my selection to stand as a MP. & ppl q why 
aren’t more women in politics.’

She
 later added: ‘It is sad and entirely wrong that there appear to be, 
still, some sections of the Conservative Party that have these attitudes
 towards women and women working in politics.

‘It’s sad that they want to demean women so publicly, and Twitter is a very public forum.

‘Comparing
 the selection of a female MP to an underwear modelling competition is 
pretty pathetic and really speaks volumes about Karl McCartney and his 
colleagues’ attitudes towards women.’

Gloria
 De Piero, Labour’s spokesman for women, last night joined the fray by 
writing to David Cameron to ask if he believes ‘there is any place in 
politics or public life’ for Mr McCartney’s attitude.

After
 a storm of criticism online, Mr Davies was forced to apologise. He said
 on Twitter: ‘Having reflected on this I think I was  wrong to post that
 photo. AWS [all-women shortlisting] is sexist but glamour pics don’t 
help. Sorry if I upset anyone.’

Apologetic: Later on Mr Davies realised his mistake and tweeted his followers again to apologise

Ms Rigby, a former solicitor, said Mr Davies had a 'demeaning and rather sad' attitude towards women

Yesterday
 he said his post was ‘clumsy’ – but that it had at least been 
successful in opening up a debate on Labour’s use of all-women 
shortlists. It is still the only party to do so, although the Lib Dems 
have recently toyed with introducing the practice in some cases.

Mr
 Davies, who is the chairman of the Conservative Association in Margaret
 Thatcher’s home town of Grantham, said of the controversy: ‘This has 
given us the opportunity to have a wider debate around all-women 
shortlists.

‘You can dress 
it up however you like, but if you discriminate against one group of 
people on the grounds of gender that is discrimination. It should not be
 allowed.’

But Miss Rigby said the councillor’s tweets were ‘symptomatic’ of sexism in the Conservative party.

She added: ‘I appreciate that there is a debate, but pictures of underwear competitions is not the way to have it.

‘Only one in five Tory MPs is a woman. That is a very small number. The fact is that the Tory party has a problem with women.’

On
 all-women shortlists, she added: ‘Quite a few people in the Labour 
party would prefer not to have them. I happen to think they’re necessary
 to get more women into politics.

‘I
 think they have been successful when they have been used and half of 
the Labour candidates that are standing in 2015 are women.’

She
 added that Mr Davies had not apologised personally to her. A recent 
COMRES poll suggests that Labour is ten points ahead of the Tories among
 women voters.

Mr 
McCartney, who has a majority of just 1,058, said his comment was made 
in reply to another  Twitter user who had picked up on the online 
debate.

The Conservative party press office declined to comment, saying it was up to Mr Davies to justify  his comments.
