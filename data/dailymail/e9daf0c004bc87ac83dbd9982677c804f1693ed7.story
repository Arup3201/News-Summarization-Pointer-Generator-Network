Graham Thorpe was the only Englishman to win on his 100th cap

On Friday, Ian Bell becomes the 12th man to play 100 Tests for England aiming to overtake Alec Stewart’s record by maintaining the best batting form of his life.

Bell would need to play for another four years if he is going to surpass the ‘gaffer’s’ tally of 133 caps but, at 32, he is young enough and fit enough to do so if he can play a leading, responsible role in England’s brave new world.

‘I hope I can get there because I feel as though I’m batting as well as I’ ve ever done in an England shirt,’ said Bell at Headingley.

‘Over the last few years I’ve started to understand what I needed to do to become a tougher cricketer and last year was probably the best I’ve played under that sort of pressure. Hopefully that’s just the start and I think there is more to come.

‘If I stay fit I want to play for England as long as I can. I love it. It was all I wanted to do as a kid and I’ve been very lucky to have been able to do it for so long. You don’t want to give that shirt up.’

This landmark seemed a long way away when Bell was dropped at the start of the last new era after England had been bowled out for 51 in Jamaica early in 2009. ‘There were times when I doubted I would get this far,’ admitted Bell.

‘That West Indies tour was the turning point. When you get dropped you ask questions of yourself.’

The answers he came up with saw him become a much more resilient member of the England side when he regained his place during the Ashes later that year. ‘I started to score runs when the team really needed them and that’s what I needed to do,’ said Bell, now England’s unofficial vice-captain.

‘Maybe in my early days I took the easy option too often. I remember the guys walking out at Lord’s at the start of that 2009 summer while I was at Edgbaston and I just had this feeling that I didn’t want to just play county cricket. I had unfinished business and when I got my next chance with England I didn’t want to let it go.’

Bell credited the late Neal Abberley at Warwickshire and sacked England batting coach Graham Gooch as the biggest influences on his career outside his family. ‘I wish Neal could be here on Friday with me,’ said Bell.

‘He was somebody who got me to where I am now and Goochie is probably as close as I’ve come to the relationship I had with Neal. They saw the game very similarly and gave me a lot of honest feedback. It will certainly be nice to share a beer with Graham at some point.’

Of the previous 11 England players to play 100 times only Graham Thorpe was in the winning side on his landmark Test, and even he never played in another after his 100th cap against Bangladesh. Bell hopes to buck the trend.

‘This week is exciting and it’s about winning rather than my 100th Test,’ he said. ‘I will look back on four winning Ashes series and winning in India when I finish but I still think there are more special things round the corner.’
