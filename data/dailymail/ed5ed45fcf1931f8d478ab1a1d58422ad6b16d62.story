A former Olympic gymnast has revealed that she will continue her pregnancy with triplets, despite doctors advising her to abort two of her babies.

Jaime Halsey and her rugby star husband Steve, both 35, were told they were expecting triplets in October, but were quickly referred to specialists who said the odds of them all surviving was 50/50.

A 12-week scan showed one of the babies was 25 per cent smaller than the others and medics advised her to terminate two of them because they could cause serious risk to her health.

But the mother-to-be, who lives in Abington, Northampton, said she would not sacrifice the lives of two of her children just to save one. 

The couple, who have already have a two-year-old daughter, said they were determined to bring all three babies into the world to join their 'happy family'. 

The former trampolinist said: 'We had our first scan in Northampton at 12 weeks and were immediately referred to specialists at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.

'They told us one of the twins is 25 per cent smaller than the other and there's a massive risk of further growth restrictions.

'I also risk putting my body under three times the strain to keep them healthy, so they advised the termination.

'My initial emotional reaction was "I can't do that, I will keep them all and carry on with the pregnancy whatever".

'Steve was much more logical wanting to know what the risks were to me but collectively we made the decision we would give the three babies the best opportunity we possibly could to come into the world.

'Other people have triplets and I wasn't prepared to abort two healthy babies just to make life easier.

'As sport has taught us both, all you need is a chance, positivity and the faith of others in your ability to be a success.'

Mrs Halsey, who was Team GB's first female trampolinist at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, married the former London Welsh rugby player in 2009.

The couple  began trying for another baby in spring last year after daughter Flo began asking for a sister.

But when she did fall pregnant scans revealed she had two monozygotic identical twins and one 'singleton' in her womb.

Consultants told them twins sharing a placenta are at risk of twin-to-twin syndrome of Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR).

Adding another baby into the equation has made her pregnancy particularly high-risk and even more rare and complicated.

Mrs Halsey is now 26 weeks and has been told she will have to deliver the triplets, all believed to be girls, by caesarean.

The new arrivals will then have to stay in incubators and be monitored carefully before they can be taken home.

The 35-year-old, who began trampolining when she was 10 and is now a coach whilst running a cake-making business from home, added: 'I am as big now as I was at full-term with Flo.

'But the hardest thing is avoiding making plans for when they are born. We have checks almost weekly as things keep changing.

'If this was my first pregnancy I would be terrified, but seeing how ace Flo is makes me confident we can do this.

'Now the panic has gone, we can be excited about our big family and noisy house.

'I am determined to make this happen. I could not live with myself if I sacrificed two of them - to save one.'

Mr Halsey - now a PE teacher - added: 'Reaching 24 weeks was a big milestone for Jaime. If they stay in there until 30 weeks then it gives me a much better chance of being born with less problems.

'Everything went well at the last scan and all three babies are growing well. The one twin remains smaller but all three are extremely active which is good news.

'We also had the chances to see the faces of our three little girls on a 3D scan which was really exciting. 

'We never thought about terminating two of the babies for a second, we want to bring all three of them into our happy family.' 

Jaime was Team GB's first female trampolinist at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games and after some time out recovering from injuries, she earned the team their place in the Beijing Games in 2008 and was then a reserve
