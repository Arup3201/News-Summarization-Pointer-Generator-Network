Argentina has passed a new law stating that all public transport and stations must display the inflammatory words: 'The Falklands are Argentina'.

The new regulation was approved unanimously in parliament last night after it was proposed by MP Teresita Luna.

Daniel Filmus, secretary of state for Falkland affairs, tweeted the announcement, saying: 'Public transport will carry the message #LasMalvinasSonArgentinas, an initiative from @terelunalarioja approved unanimously.'

Argentina's football team poses with a banner reading 'The Falklands are Argentina' which will now be marked on all public transport and stations in the country after a law was voted in unanimously in parliament 

The law, part of more than 60 public transport measures, means all vehicles on road, rail, water or in the air must be marked with the phrase, it was reported by The Daily Telegraph.

However, some Argentines took issue with the move, with one tweeting: 'Haven't you got anything more urgent to deal with?'

Ms Luna, 41, a politician from La Rioja province in the west of the country near the border with Chile.

Given her distance from the British territory, it is not clear why she has been the forerunner for the vote.

However, the campaign #LasMalvinasSonArgentinas has been gathering traction in recent months. 

In July, Argentina's football chiefs were fined £19,500 by FIFA after their players posed with a political banner laying claim to the Falkland Islands.

The players stood behind the slogan ‘Las Malvinas son Argentinas’ (the Falklands are Argentinian) at a June 7 friendly against Slovenia in Buenos Aires. 

Clarkson and the Top Gear team were forced to flee Argentina this summer after the outspoken presenter was spotted driving around the country with a number plate believed to reference the Falklands War of 1982

The world governing body opened disciplinary proceedings against the AFA last month following the controversial incident.

The message was displayed in support of an on-going campaign to claim sovereignty of the islands, a British Overseas Territory in the South Atlantic Ocean.

A statement from FIFA said the AFA had been fined and issued with a reprimand after it was deemed to be in breach of Article 60 of the FIFA stadium safety and security regulations ('political action') and Article 52 of the FIFA disciplinary code ('team misconduct'). 

It also comes after a furious row erupted when Jeremy Clarkson was spotted driving through Argentina with a number plate H982 FKL which some claimed a reference to the Falklands War. 

The Top Gear cast and crew had to flee the South American country after they were attacked by an angry mob, which Clarkson described as 'the most terrifying thing I've ever been involved in.'

Alicia Castro, the Argentinian ambassador to the UK, demanded an apology from BBC head of television Danny Cohen during a meeting this month - which the corporation refused to give.
