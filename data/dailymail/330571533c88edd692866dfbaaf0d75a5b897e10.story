Andy Murray has backed the Queen's Club in London to host July's Davis Cup quarter-final between Great Britain and France.

Great Britain sealed a second successive last-eight tie with a 3-2 victory against the USA in Glasgow last weekend.

And the LTA is now looking to book a grass-court venue for the tie which takes place on July 17-19, the weekend following the conclusion of Wimbledon.

Sportsmail understands an approach was made to Queen's earlier this week to gauge the club's interest in holding the tie.

Queen's hosts the AEGON Championships from June 15-21 where Murray has been a three time winner, picking up titles at the pre-Wimbledon event in 2009, 2011 and 2013.

For Queen's to stage the Davis Cup this year, the temporary stands would have to remain in place for another four weeks and it remains to be seen whether the club would be willing to put up with the extra disruption as a result.

Murray made it blatantly clear on Saturday, though, that Queen's is his preferred venue during a post-match interview after his second-round win against Vasek Pospisil in Indian Wells.

Murray told Sky Sports: 'I hope we can do it at Queen's Club. They'll get a crowd there. I really like the conditions there.

'James Ward has played well there in the past. My brother [Jamie] made the final there last year so the players in our team have done well there.

'It just depends on if they can get the court ready on time and if they would like to host it.

'I think we need to play in an arena that is big enough for the tie and I think they can get 7,500-8,000 people there. I think that would be a good place to play.'
