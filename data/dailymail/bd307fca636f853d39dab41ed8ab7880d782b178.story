Exam watchdogs last night dismissed calls for the wholesale regrading of this summer’s English GCSE papers, despite admitting that nearly 60,000 pupils who entered early got away with an easier test.

Ofqual said schools had been ‘surprised’ after ‘two decades of grade inflation’ were finally brought under control.

It said English grades issued to nearly 670,000 pupils this summer were fair and comparable with last year, and regrading would be ‘impossible to justify’.

Action: Teachers and parents protest outside Education Secretary Michael Gove's office earlier this week over claims GCSE English exams were unfairly marked

The watchdog conceded that English 
GCSEs set in January – taken by more than 58,000 pupils – were ‘graded 
generously’. However, it had decided it would be unfair to strip these 
candidates of their grades.

Heads and teachers denounced the report as a ‘whitewash’ and renewed threats of legal action against exam boards.

Ofqual’s report claimed that schools 
were partly to blame for the problem by attaching too much importance to
grade boundaries set in January that they should have known were 
subject to change.

This had caused some teachers to make excessively 
generous predictions of pupils’ final achievements.

'Grade robbers': Headteachers today warned they could still mount a legal challenge over GCSE English as Ofqual said that this summer's results will not be re-graded

Under pressure: Education Secretary Michael Gove (pictured) has been called on to make a statement to Parliament on Monday about how the government intends to address concerns about GCSE English

Q. So, now that Ofqual has published its findings, is that the end of the matter, then?

No. The unions are generally unhappy about Ofqual's stance.

The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) maintains that there has been a 'systemic failure' in the awarding of GCSE English grades.

They are most concerned that thousands of students who should have got a C in their English GCSE instead got a D, generally considered a fail, even though officially it is a pass, and that it could affect their chances of getting into the sixth-form college, or gaining an apprenticeship.

Q. What do the unions want to happen?

There have been calls for results to be re-graded and Ofqual to reconsider its findings.

They say it is 'wholly unacceptable to leave the students and their teachers to pick up the pieces of a problem they did not cause' and that 'it is not acceptable or practicable to make the students resit examinations'.

They also say that the grade boundaries should have not have been moved during the academic year amid fears that too many children were going to get a C.

Q. What will happen now?

Ofqual says it will continue to go through any further evidence with unions and talk to them about wider issues around exams and gradings, as well as information and advice to teachers and schools.

Labour education spokesman Stephen Twigg wants Education Secretary Michael Gove to address the issue in Parliament on Monday, when MPs go back after their summer break.

And education unions bosses are threatening to begin a legal challenge against the grade boundary changes on the grounds that it disadvantaged certain groups of students. This could be a protracted debate.

Up to 1,000 schools submitted evidence to Ofqual’s inquiry claiming that English grades were lower than expected.

But Ofqual insisted: ‘The standard set
for these English GCSEs is comparable with that in previous years. Each
exam board set standards for the qualifications in the manner 
expected.’

In a concession, Ofqual said it would 
allow pupils, as a one-off, an extra, earlier resit opportunity in 
November. But this will come as little comfort to those who were 
supposed to be starting sixth-form or college courses on Monday and 
missed the  C grades they needed to confirm places.

Ofqual carried out the inquiry after the first drop in GCSE results in the exam’s history.

Headache: Teachers claim the grade boundary changes during the year have disadvantaged certain groups of students

Concern focused on English after the C
pass mark dropped 1.5 points – from 65.4 to 63.9 per cent. C grades in 
the subject are demanded by many employers and universities while 
schools risk closure or being taken over if they persistently fail to 
bring enough pupils up to the standard.

Ofqual said: ‘We know that schools and colleges will be disappointed with our conclusions.

‘Many will have been hoping that we 
would conclude that the June grade boundaries were too harsh, and that 
we should return to the January boundaries.

'Doing so would undermine 
standards and damage confidence.’

But Brian Lightman of the Association 
of School and College Leaders, said: ‘There has been a systemic failure 
over the awarding of English GCSE grades. If necessary we will resort to
a legal challenge.’
