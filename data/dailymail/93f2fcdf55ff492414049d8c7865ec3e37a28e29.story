The French lost little time in ridiculing David Cameron's decision to hold a referendum on Europe saying they will 'roll out the red carpet' for UK Businessmen should Britain vote to leave the EU.

French Foreign minister Laurent Fabius was mimicking the Prime Minister's comment last summer, that Britain would welcome Gallic companies if a left-wing government was elected in France.

His cheeky quip came as Cameron promised a referendum on the issue of EU membership by 2017 providing he is re-elected.

Quip: As David Cameron promised a referendum on Europe, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said his country would 'roll out the red carpet' for British businessmen if the UK voted to leave the EU

Mr Fabius suggested that Britain will turn into a basket case economy if it does exit the EU following the nationwide poll.

Speaking on French radio just before Mr Cameron made his keynote speech in London, Mr Fabius said he had told a recent meeting of UK businessmen: ‘If Britain wants to leave Europe we will roll out the red carpet for you.’

Mr Fabius said Britain had ‘positive points’ to offer Europe, but said that there could be no ‘Europe a la carte’ with the UK choosing what it wanted to contribute. 

‘Imagine that Europe is a football club,’ said Mr Fabius. ‘You join the football club, but once you’re in, you can’t say “Let's play rugby” ’.

Speaking this morning to business 
leaders at the Bloomberg headquarters in central London, Mr Cameron 
promised to hold a straightforward 'in/out' referendum on Britain’s 
membership of the EU.

He
 declared: 'It is time for the British people to have their say. It is 
time to settle this European question in British politics.'

Pledge: David Cameron promised an in/out referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union by the end of 2017, if the Conservatives win the next general election

The Prime Minister rejected the 
founding EU principle of 'ever closer union', insisting powers must flow
 back to, not just away from member states. He warned public 
disillusionment with the EU is 'at an all time high'.

But he insisted it was in Britain's 
interest to remain in a reformed EU, and if he can secure changes he 
will argue in favour of staying in.

He added: 'Because I believe 
something very deeply. That Britain’s national interest is best served 
in a flexible, adaptable and open European Union and that such a 
European Union is best with Britain in it.

'We will give the British people a 
referendum with a very simple in or out choice to stay in the EU on 
these new terms or come out altogether. 

'Over the coming weeks, months and 
years, I will not rest until this debate is won. For the future of my 
country. For the success of the European Union. And for the prosperity 
of our peoples for generations to come.'

Wading in: London Mayor Boris Johnson suggested a French tax on financial transactions would 'cost jobs' in Paris

It was Mr Cameron who, last summer, 
infuriated French Socialists by saying  his country would ‘roll out the 
red carpet’ to Gallic companies if a left-wing government was elected.

The
 Socialists did win the election, and since then numerous business 
leaders have made plans to emigrate so as to avoid a top tax rate of 75 
per cent.

The British and French have clashed repeatedly over European financial policy in recent years, and have always had very different views about the future of the EU.

In a high high-profile argument over new European budget rules at a summit in 2011, the then conservative French president Nicolas Sarkozy famously told Mr Cameron he had ‘missed a great opportunity to shut his mouth.’

London Mayor Boris Johnson has also 
suggested that France’s determination to implement a tax on financial 
transactions would ‘clearly cost jobs’ in Paris and said the UK capital 
would benefit.

‘Bienvenue
 à Londres – this is the global capital of finance,’ Mr Johnson said 
last year. ‘It’s on your doorstep and if your own president does not 
want the jobs, the opportunities and the economic growth that you 
generate, we do.’

Several hundred thousand French citizens already live and work in London and all of France’s major banks have offices in the UK.

Meanwhile German Chancellor Angela 
Merkel said her government would be ready to listen to Britain's 
'wishes' over the EU in the hope of finding a 'fair compromise'.

She said: 'Germany, and I personally, want Britain to be an important part and an active member of the European Union.

'We
 are prepared to talk about British wishes but we must always bear in 
mind that other countries have different wishes and we must find a fair 
compromise. We will talk intensively with Britain about its individual 
ideas but that has some time over the months ahead.'

However her foreign minister Guido Westerwelle warned UK against 'cherry-picking' on Europe.

Arguing for more European 
integration, Mr Westerwelle said: 'Germany wants the United Kingdom to 
remain an active and constructive part of the European Union... But 
cherry picking is not an option.'

Fears: Both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Irish Deputy prime Minister Tanaiste Eamon Gilmore hope that Britain stay within the EU

Gunther Krichbaum, a close ally of 
Angela Merkel's and head of the Bundestag european affairs committee said; 'Cameron said that he wants Britain to shape the future.

'How can you shape the future 
if you put the car in reverse while other regions of the world are on 
the fast lane? 

'In a changing world, voices from 
Europe will only be heard if we join forces. As the African saying goes:
 If you want to travel fast, go alone. If you want to travel far, go 
together.

'I'm a bit surprised that Great 
Britain wants to renegotiate the rules. Britain is not a new member 
state, it did not just join the European Union.

'It had a say in 
negotiating all the rules and treaties. If we opened that Pandora's Box,
 all the pulling and hauling would start again and we would probably end
 up in the same spot.

Spain's Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo warned a withdrawal would leave UK industry and commerce balanced on 'a few insular stools'

'By announcing a referendum for 2016, Cameron risks to paralyze the European Union for years. But Great Britain needs a European Union and especially a single market that is functioning.'

In Brussels, Martin Schulz, the German president of the European Parliament and a member of the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) seeking to topple Angela Merkel's conservatives at the general election in September, sharply rebuffed Cameron's criticism.He said: 'The reforms necessary to make the EU more effective, more transparent and leaner had failed in part because Britain had blocked them. They are the ones who are largley responsible for the delays in Europe and also the ones pointing their fingers at Europe.

'Britain just wants to reduce the EU to an overseas marketplace.'

And Spain's Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo accused Britain of 'dragging its feet' and warned a withdrawal would leave UK industry and commerce balanced on 'a few insular stools'.

He said: 'I am convinced that abandoning Europe would be a terrible blow to Britain's finance and industry....trying to compete in isolation with powers like the U.S., China, India and Brazil is not to understand the times in which we are living.

'For the EU it is not good that a country as important as the UK goes, but on the other hand Cameron needs to understand that you cannot keep stopping the engine, cannot seek a renegotiation of treaties undoing what we have done, or putting the brakes on the speed at which the EU is cruising at a time when integration is more necessary than ever.

Ireland's deputy prime minister Tanaiste Eamon Gilmore said it was in Britain's best interests to remain within the EU.

He said: 'The European Union is better with Britain in it, and I think Britain is better being in the European Union.'
