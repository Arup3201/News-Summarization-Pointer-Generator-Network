The festive period may be almost over but these lions at a Cambridgeshire zoo have received a belated Christmas gift.

The big cats at Linton Zoological Gardens are being given discarded Christmas trees as toys to play with and chew on.

According to zookeepers, the cut trees are like 'catnip' to the animals and provide them with hours of fun.

One of the lions at Linton Zoo rolls around on the ground with his new Christmas tree toy, which keepers say provides the animals with hours of fun 

The lions enjoying biting on the trunks of the trees as well as ripping apart the branches.

And now the zoo is urging families to drop off their used Christmas trees to provide the animals with new toys for the new year.

Kim Simmons, a director at the zoo said: 'We've already had quite a few trees coming in, which are giving the lions hours of fun.'

It is thought that the lions love playing with the trees as they contain catnip, sometimes known as catmint, a plant of the mint family, which can cause many cats euphoria.

According to zookeepers, the cut trees are like 'catnip' to the lions and they love chewing and ripping apart the branches 

Meanwhile dead trees that are being donated to the zoo are being used in their bio-burner to provide additional heating for the buildings.

In addition, trees that still have a root ball are being re-planted in a small meadow area of the zoo and in the snowy owl enclosure.

It is the third year running that the zoo has appealed for local people to donate their old Christmas trees.

And so far this year, they have had double the amount of usual donations.
