Melvin Clary was a man obsessed with everything about the ocean.

A deep sea fisherman from Livermore, California, 'Mel' loved to go abalone hunting with his two sons and explore the tide pools at Fitzgerald Marine Reserve with the rest of the family.

So when he passed away earlier this month, he not only wanted to be laid to rest in the ocean - he wanted his memory to be cast out to sea.

And so on August 17, Mel's loved ones bottled up a message written on his behalf in a special airtight container, according to My Modern Met.

After spreading his ashes in Half Moon Bay, the bottle was sent out on the waves.

Much-loved: Melvin Clary is seen here i hospital surrounded by his family before his death

Heartwarming: The family of Melvin Clary wanted to do something special in his honor

Out to sea: His ashes were dropped into the ocean at Half Moon Bay in California

Next: The all-important message in the bottle - written on Mel's behalf - is prepared for its launch

Joyous: The Clary family celebrate sending off the bottle in memory of their beloved Melvin

Inside, the note read:

My name is Mel, I have 3 beautiful kids and a beautiful wife of almost 54 years when I passed.

I love the ocean, deep sea fishing , abalone hinting with my 2 son's and visitng the tide pools with the whole family.

Today my family is laying me to rest in a place that I love ... the ocean.

So, this starts my journey.

If you find this message in a bottle please go to my Facebook page - Melvin's Journey - post a pic of yourself and where you found me, and send me back on my journey.

Thanks and God Bless

Mel's family

And, sure, enough, after a view days, the bottle turned ashore about seven miles south at Francis Beach.

Ahoy: The bottle first was found by a young local, Willie Tang, last Sunday, a few days after it was cast off

Cracking it: The finders used a cork screw to pop over the top lid, which then has a cork underneath to keep water from getting in

Inside was the message, complete with the date the bottle was set off

Special: The note asks anyone who should find the bottle to take a picture and post it to a Facebook page called Melvin's Journey

The bottle was found by a local, Willie Tang, who discovered it while fishing at Francis Beach.

As the note asked, Tang posted his pictures to Facebook.

He then set the bottle back on its way.

The Clary family are hoping many more people are able to be touched by the message and then share their experience online.

Special: Willie Tang holds up the bottle he found. The Clary family are excited for who else might find the treasure
