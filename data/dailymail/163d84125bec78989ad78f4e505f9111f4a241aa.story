A former middle school teacher who performed a lap dance for a pupil in her class has been spared jail but will spend three years on probation.

Felicia A. Smith, 42, from Spring, Texas admitted to the felony of having an improper relationship with a student at Stovall Middle School in Houston Texas in February.

She was charged with the felony back in April and posted a
 $30,000 bond.

Inappropriate: Felicia Smith allegedly gave one of her students a lap dance in front of the entire class of teens

According to court records, Smith 
performed the lap dance for the teenager in front of a class full of 
students and ended the dance by hugging the boy and saying, 'I love you 
baby, happy birthday.'

Court records showed that Smith admitted to police that she gave the student a lap dance on his birthday after the class 'convinced her to do it.'

The student told police that at the beginning of his third-period class, Smith placed a chair in front of the room and music began playing.

The class began yelling for the boy to sit down, and when he did, Smith began dancing for the boy.

He said he became aroused as Smith fondled him and rubbed her hands and buttocks on his body and allowed him to slap her buttocks.

Smith told police she remembered 'circling the student while he was sitting in the chair and losing her balance a few times which made the students laugh.’

Toward the end of the dance, according to the documents, the boy said Smith got on her knees and placed her head between his legs.

The dance lasted almost four minutes and was reportedly captured on video. 

Shortly after the incident, the Aldine Independent School District said in a statement: ‘The safety and security of our students will continue to be a top priority in Aldine ISD.'
