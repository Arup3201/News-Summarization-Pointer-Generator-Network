Ruth Palmer,25,  had her identity stolen by a con artist 

A married 25-year-old has spoken of her horror after her life was stolen by a mystery woman in a bid to attract unsuspecting men.

Ruth Palmer found that nearly 1,000 of her images and real details about her life had been used to set up a host of Twitter and Instagram accounts. 

The 25-year-old discovered the 'catfish' -  an Internet scammer who fabricates online identities and entire social circles to trick people into romantic relationships - had been using her details for three years.

Using the fake name Leah Palmer she duped two men into believing they were in a relationship with the brunette.  

The imposter even set up fake accounts for her mother and friends to make the social media profiles appear more realistic. 

When Mrs Palmer complained to the social networks, they shut down the accounts.

But just days later, more false profiles  were set up.

Mrs Palmer, who is married and from Brighton, East Sussex, now fears the perpetrator has become 'obsessed' with her life.

'It is horrible and I just can't understand what must be going through this person's head to do this,' she said.

'It has been horrific for me, my family, friends and husband.

'I am now fearful of whoever this is as they are seemingly not able to stop this and nothing seems to deter them.

'I feel violated and completely invaded and would very much like this to be broadcast to as many people as possible as this could be happening for many, many others.

'Circa 900 images and videos of my own personal experiences had been taken from my own social media accounts, some from five years back.'

'Now this maybe sounds fairly average given the social media society we live in today, however the imposter had gone even deeper than what I had originally thought when I looked into it further.

The mystery scammer, who goes by the name Leah Palmer,  has stolen pictures and personal details from Ms Palmer

Ms Palmer from Brighton, East Sussex, now fears that the scammer is 'obsessed' with her personal life 

'I found the person held a two-and-a-half-year online relationship with someone whom they spoke to every night on the phone, text messaged and exchanged emails with.

'It was a massive web of deceit.'

When Mrs Palmer found the false profiles, she immediately contacted the victims, which includes a golfer and a DJ, to warn them of the scam.

She also called a mobile number that the imposter had been giving out to her victims.

But she claims a woman who answered simply hung up the phone and the number is now out of use.

Mrs Palmer added: 'The victims were horrified when I told them the person they'd been speaking to wasn't who they said they were.

The social media accounts reappear days after they are shut down by sites

'I have spoken to around five or six different men who have been involved with her but unfortunately since they are all in the public eye, they want to remain anonymous.

'I also found the imposter had been making online friendships with other girls pretending to be interested in their lives.

'Disturbingly they also created a fake social media account of my friend using my friend's real name and started having conversations between both the imposter and the 'friend' account.

'My mum, who is a psychologist, says the catfish must be really troubled in the head.'

But it is the catfish's knowledge of her personal details that Miss Palmer finds most troubling.

She said: 'They told people that 'Leah' lived in Brighton and had moved to Dubai recently and that she had two brothers and a cat called Misty, whilst using all the genuine lives of my social group of friends as her own.

'All of which are true accounts of my own life.

''Leah' also said my genuine friends were her friends and gave accounts of where she had been with them and spoke about events she had been to with them.' 

Mrs Palmer complained to Sussex Police but her case was referred to Action Fraud - the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and internet crime..

The service is run by the City of London Police, who work alongside the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau.

But Action Fraud said there has been no criminality.

Merryn Hockaday, of Action Fraud, said: 'Ruth Palmer's case has been 'no crimed' by the Crime Registrar and the report will now be classed as an information report.

Ms Palmer said that the con woman has so far duped a golfer and a DJ using her images and personal information 

'Information reports are not investigated by the police, but they are kept on record and used for intelligence purposes.

'This means the case will be kept on record to help inform intelligence.

'It may be, that in the future, a similar report comes in and criminal activity has taken place, the reports could be linked somehow, by suspect, location etc and it could help to inform the intelligence for that investigation.'

Mrs Palmer added: 'I just want people to be aware of what can happen online. You never know what's going on - and what a profound affect something like this can have on your life.

'It's crazy. I genuinely don't feel like it has actually happened but sadly it really has and the situation keeps unravelling where more and more people have been duped by this imposter for either online friendships or online relationships.

'It's scary the length to which the imposter has gone.'
