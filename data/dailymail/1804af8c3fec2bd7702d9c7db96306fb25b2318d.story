Hacked to death: Lt Col David Parkinson (right) was attacked by five intruders as he was sleeping beside his wife of 35 years, Sonja (left), in Kenya

A gang that hacked to death a former Parachute Regiment officer in Kenya may be linked to a previous attack on a British couple, police revealed yesterday.

Nature reserve manager Lt Col David Parkinson, 58, was killed by five robbers at his remote home.

They took the equivalent of  £1.90 in cash plus a laptop and bottles of wine after Sonja Parkinson, 52, managed to escape and barricade herself in the house’s panic room.

A local man has been detained and questioned over the attack on the Parkinsons but has not been formally arrested in connection with Sunday’s break-in at their home in Lolldaiga Hills, near Mount Kenya National Park.

The couple were asleep when the robbers used smashed their way into their bedroom  and demanded money and guns.

Mrs Parkinson was tied up and threatened and her husband attacked as he fought to defend her.

Police believe he may have been knocked  unconscious before being struck with broad-bladed machetes, known locally as pangas.

Lt Co Parkinson, from Brighton. East Sussex, was formerly a director of Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya, where Prince William spent part of his gap year.

He was awarded an OBE in 1998 for his military service.

Police said there were parallels with the robbery and a raid on the home of another former British army officer and his wife in the region in June.

Two men are expected to face trial for  that attack, but two other raiders had not been traced.

It is likely that Lt Col Parkinson bled to death during a raid in which by an armed gang stole a laptop, $3 and bottles of wine.

A former grammar school pupil from Brighton, he was awarded an OBE at St James’ Palace by Prince Charles in 1998 for his military service.

Last night, Kenyan police said the retired soldier’s hand was cut off as he struggled with the intruders in order to give his wife enough time to reach safety.

Local police chief Maurice Tum said the robbers gained entry by smashing the windows and ordered Lt Col Parkinson to hand over money and guns.

He added: ‘A fight ensured between the men and the soldier and they cut off his left hand and left him bleeding profusely.

'The
 wife hid in the strong room. It was this decision which saved her. She 
came out and found her bleeding husband and contacted the police.’

Lt Col Parkinson, who served in the Army for 30 years, became manager of the ranch after leaving Lewa in 2008.

Before taking up his place at St Andrews University, Prince William spent his gap year at Lewa, helping with various conservation projects.

In 2010, he and Kate holidayed there, staying in a secluded rustic log cabin where William proposed.

The Duchess said: ‘He’s a true romantic and we had a wonderful holiday in Africa. It was very romantic and it was a very personal time for both of us.’

Last night the Duke of Cambridge, who is a patron of Lewa, said he was ‘saddened’ to hear about Lt Col Parkinson’s death.

Mrs Parkinson, who owns a local arts and crafts company called Mitumba Art, was taken to hospital and treated for shock.

'Saddened': The soldier was formerly a director of Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, where Prince William (right) spent his gap year as a 19-year-old and where he proposed to Kate Middleton (left, with Prince George)

A friend and neighbour said: ‘He was very
 dynamic, doing an amazing job in Lolldaiga for both conservation and 
the community. He was a very well-liked man.’

Lt Col Parkinson joined the Army in 1973 after graduating from the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst.

Maurice Tum, local Kenyan police chief

Known to his fellow soldiers as Parky, he joined the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces, before becoming chief instructor at Sandhurst.

On his last tour before retiring, he commanded the British Army training organisation in Nairobi.

In 2003, he and his wife permanently relocated to Kenya where he took up his post with Lewa, a growing conservation and community development project.

The couple sold their home in Hassocks, West Sussex, for £500,000 three years later. They have two daughters, Anna, 33 and Renate, 29. Lt Col Parkinson took up the post with Lolldaiga Hills at the start of this year.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ‘We are aware of the death of a British national in Kenya and our team at the High Commission in Nairobi are providing consular assistance.’
