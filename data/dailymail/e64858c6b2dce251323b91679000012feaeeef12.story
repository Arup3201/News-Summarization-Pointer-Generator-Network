A married physics professor has been arrested for allegedly running a prostitution website with 200 women and more than 1,400 clients.

David Flory, who teaches at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey,  set up the site so 'trusted' users could find, rate and review prostitutes in Albuquerque, New Mexico, near his second home in Santa Fe.

Flory, a grandfather, allegedly told police he thought of the website as a helpful hobby, which he designed as 'a safe place for guys to find female prostitutes.'

Police are now trawling through the client database to find out who was using the website, and are urging members to give themselves up.

Flory was arrested in Albuquerque on 
Sunday after a six-month undercover operation to track down who was 
behind the site, Southwest Companions.

Officers claim Flory, who is in his late
 sixties, was even logged on to the website via his phone when they 
arrested him in a branch of Starbucks.

He and his wife Sharon, a psychotherapist who specialises in eating disorders, live in an apartment in Manhattan's exclusive Upper West Side, but keep a holiday home in Santa Fe.

They rent out the house, called Casa de Los Arboles, and say it 'provides 2,800 square feet of gracious living'.

They have two adult daughters, Gillian and Miranda, a stepdaughter, Cynthia, and four grandchildren.

Flory has a masters degree from Columbia University and a PhD from Yeshiva, and has taught at Fairleigh Dickinson since 1969.

According to police, Southwest
 Companions was run entirely by Flory, who designed three categories of 
membership, each of which had to be approved by him.

First-time visitors had to gain Flory's trust before they could access the website, police said.

They did this by sleeping with one of the girls, who allegedly reported back to Flory with details of payment and the sexual acts performed.

At this point members were classed as 'verified', and could access more of the site.

Only once they became frequent users were they upgraded to 'trusted' members, allowing them to view the whole site - including tips on how to avoid police.

Lieutenant William Roseman said  'Once you became a trusted member you had access to reviews of the 
girls... where they would actually write reviews of the girls they've 
slept with, what acts they would commit, how much their charged.'

He told the Record: 'They had descriptions of my officers, phone numbers they used, videos 
of an attorney telling them that if you get busted by the police, here’s
 what you should do.

'This was a website designed, 
managed and run fully for prostitution.'

He said police tracked Flory down after one of the prostitutes tipped them off.

Undercover detectives then posed as website users for months, eventually becoming 'trusted' members so they could see the whole site and eventually find Flory.

He was arrested on Sunday and is being held in Albuquerque on $100,000 bail. He has been charged with 40 counts of promoting prostitution.

Dina Schipper, a spokesman for Fairleigh Dickinson, said she could not comment on whether Flory was still employed by the university, but she said staff were 'saddened' by the news.

She told the Record: 'Our hearts go out to all of those impacted by the situation.

'Since becoming aware of the arrest, the university has cooperated
 with law enforcement authorities as they seek to gain the most accurate
 information as part of their ongoing investigation in New Mexico.'
