Trial: Abid Naseer goes on trial today in New York after pleading not guilty to accusations of a conspiracy to bomb the New York City subway

Details of the oath of allegiance taken by new Al Qaeda recruits were laid bare yesterday.

They pledged to obey Osama Bin Laden ‘for the establishment of the religion of God’ and help the terror chief wage jihad.

The pledge emerged at the trial of an Al Qaeda suspect accused of plotting to blow up a Manchester shopping centre.

It was among a haul of intelligence seized by US Navy Seal commandos during the mission to kill Bin Laden in his Pakistan compound. It is the first time any of this valuable information has been used in a prosecution.

The oath, submitted in evidence to the New York trial of former Manchester student Abid Naseer, reads: ‘I accept your allegiance on behalf of Sheikh Osama, to listen and obey, in hardship and ease, and to follow whomever Sheikh Osama assigns to be my amir on the jihad for the sake of God, for the establishment of the religion of God, and to memorise the secrets of the group and to be where I am ordered to.’

Prosecutors said yesterday that Naseer, 28, led the Manchester cell of a three-pronged Al Qaeda plot in 2009 to ‘repeat the devastation of 9/11’.

As well as blowing up the Arndale Centre, the terror group planned to set off bombs in the New York subway and at the offices of a Copenhagen newspaper that had published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, the court heard. 

The trial was told Naseer, who was extradited to the US two years ago, was sent to the UK from Pakistan in 2008 with co-conspirators to ‘become westerners’, manufacture explosives and plant them at a target that would ‘bomb hundreds of innocent people and cause millions of dollars of damage’.

Although he is not accused of being involved in the New York attack plan, US prosecutors say the three plots ‘were all connected and all part of one Al Qaeda conspiracy’.

Jurors would be shown a letter from Al Qaeda’s head of western operations that proved the Manchester plot ‘went all the way to the top of Al Qaeda – to none other than Osama Bin Laden’, said prosecutor Celia Cohen. 

‘You will see the chilling reminder in that letter to Osama Bin Laden that Al Qaeda’s goal was to attack the infidel in their home territory’, she said.

The text of the Al Qaeda 'pledge of allegiance', which has been translated by prosecutors. 

We, of course, take the pledge of allegiance on behalf of Sheikh Usama bin Laden. We say in the wording something like: I accept your allegiance on behalf of Sheikh Usama, to listen and obey, in hardship and ease, and to follow whomsoever Sheikh Usama assigns to be my Amir on the jihad for the sake of God, for the establishment of the religion of God, and the rule of Islam that governs the law of God, and to memorise the secrets of the group, and to be where I am ordered to.

Naseer has denied charges of providing material support to terrorists and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction. 

He faces life imprisonment if convicted. 

The jury is set to hear evidence next week from six undercover MI5 agents who are being allowed to testify disguised by wigs and make-up in order to conceal their identities.

The trial is also unusual as Naseer has decided to represent himself in court. 

Wearing an open-necked yellow shirt and bushy beard, Naseer read out his opening statement and later tried repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, to challenge the testimony of a confessed Al-Qaeda member, Najibullah Zazi, who is giving evidence against him. 

The court heard Naseer followed the terror training he received in Pakistan, communicating with his Al Qaeda handler by using the email names of women.

He also used code, using women’s names for the types of explosive he was considering and referring to the actual bomb attack as a ‘marriage’ or ‘wedding’, said prosecutors.

When he told his Al Qaeda contact he was sorry he would ‘miss the party’, Naseer was referring to the hopefully devastating Arndale Centre explosion, the court heard.

However, Naseer insisted he had been in the UK simply to look for a Muslim bride.

The trial continues.
