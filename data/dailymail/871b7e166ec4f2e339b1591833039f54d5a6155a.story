A trio of 'greedy' middle-class women have been sentenced over a £21 million pyramid scheme which fleeced more than 10,000 people out of their savings.

The group used emails and 'champagne celebration nights' to cajole victims - mainly women -  to 'beg, borrow or steal' £3,000 to invest in the scam, Bristol Crown Court heard.

Their targets were reeled in by the promise of a  £24,000 payout once they reached the top of their pyramid chart, with organisers promising they 'could not lose'.

Charts co-ordinator Nash, 65, and committee secretary Crane, 69, (pictured) wept today as they were jailed 

They were shown photos of the scheme's success stories rifling through heaps of money or lying in cash-filled bathtubs.

The scheme, called Give and Take (G&T), quickly spread from Bath and Bristol to areas of the UK including London, Yorkshire and Wales between May 2008 and April 2009.

The promise was that once the payout target was reached the pyramid would split into two and the process would start again.

Games co-ordinator Hazel Cameron, 54, was handed a six-month custodial sentence suspended for two years

But whereas committee members behind the scheme pocketed up to £92,000 each, almost 90 per cent of their victims lost between £3,000 and £15,000.

When the flow of new members dried up the pyramid leaders continued accepting money knowing there was little chance of the scheme ever paying out.

Eleven women aged between 34 and 69 became the first in the UK to be prosecuted for such a scheme, under legislation from the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Act 2008.

Six of the group were convicted of operating and promoting the scheme, while three others were convicted of promoting the scheme.

Charts co-ordinator Mary Nash, 65, and committee secretary Susan Crane, 69, wept today as they were jailed for six months, while games co-ordinator Hazel Cameron, 54, was handed a six-month custodial sentence suspended for two years. 

In April last year three were each jailed for nine months after they were convicted of operating and promoting the scam.

They were Laura Fox, 69, the mastermind of the Give and Take scheme, Jennifer Smith-Hayes, 69, the treasurer, and Carol Chalmers, 68, who organised venues. All have now served their sentences and been released.

Other members Sally Phillips, 34, admitted promoting the scheme and received a three month jail term suspended for two years and a three month curfew.

Rita Lomas, 49, and Jane Smith, 50, admitted promoting and got four month and four-and-a-half month jail terms respectively, both suspended for two years.

Two others, Rhalina Yuill, 33, and Tracey Laurence, 58, were cleared of all charges. 

Sentencing Nash, Crane and Cameron today, Judge Mark Horton said: 'Many people will wonder how so many mature women of good character and unblemished careers got involved in such a large, destructive and socially corrosive illegal investment scheme.

'The sad answer, I regret to give, is one of financial greed, deceit and selfishness overall which in their turn led to a catastrophic loss to a large number of innocent members of the community duped by one of the oldest investment deceptions of all time.

'You knew no one would join a scheme where there was a risk you could lose.

'You knew the precise mood and desperation of those who were drawn into the web of this deceitful scheme.'

He added: 'You did nothing to stop the scheme or protect those very vulnerable, but were solely concerned that you were not personally identified as committee members.

'This was undoubtedly directed at ordinary members of the public who were encouraged to beg, borrow or steal to get on to the scheme where they couldn't lose.'

Jude Horton said none of the women showed remorse for their actions and victims, including nurses, had to take up two jobs after applying for loans to join the scheme.

Bristol Crown Court heard the defendants, all from Bristol and Somerset, promoted the scheme through 'pamper' parties where they would seduce others to join.

Miles Bennett, prosecuting, told the court: 'People were simply lead to believe that by joining they just couldn't lose.

'In these schemes it is always the case that 86 to 88 per cent of all people that get involved always lose their money - people were caught up in these meetings, sometimes 180 people at any one time.

'The irony is that none of these defendants needed the money from this scheme at all.

'Many of the women who joined borrowed from friends and family and high interest credit because they believed there was no chance of losing.'

Laura Fox, 69, from East Harptree, Somerset, was one of the ringleaders of the get-rich-quick scheme

During the trials, jurors heard how the scheme operated around pyramid charts.

Each of 15 spaces was filled with a participant who paid £3,000 and introduced two friends, who also paid that amount.

Once the chart was filled, the eight people on the bottom of the chart paid their £3,000 to the person on the top, called the 'Bride'.

Participants collected their winnings at specialist prize-giving pamper parties, where they would be asked a series of simple questions before being handed the £24,000.

A set £1,000 fee from the payout was deducted, with £600 shared between charities and £400 used to pay costs the committee occurred.

Miles Bennett, who prosecuted both trials, said potential recruits were invited to the parties at the Battleborough Grange Hotel in Burnham-on-Sea, owned by Carol Chalmers.

The 'champagne evening celebrations' were attended by up to 300 people, who paid £2 entry for games and drinks.

Mobile phone footage recorded at one of the parties showed Laura Fox shouting: 'We are gambling in our own homes and that's what makes it legal.

'This is Carol's home, we have been friends since we were 11-years-old. We are going to do these games, that's what makes it legal and tax free.'

After games were played, the winnings were handed over to the Brides at the top of their charts in cash - with as much as £240,000 handed out in one evening.

But Mr Bennett said the celebration evenings were a 'commercial practice', with the committee holding meetings and entrants writing their names on a signing in book before entering.

'This wasn't a bunch of ladies sitting around playing bridge,' Mr Bennett said. 'This was a committee and Laura Fox ruled those nights with a rod of iron.'

'This wasn't a kitchen hobby, this was a scheme that sucked in a lot of people and which worked on the promise of them receiving riches way beyond their initial investment.'
