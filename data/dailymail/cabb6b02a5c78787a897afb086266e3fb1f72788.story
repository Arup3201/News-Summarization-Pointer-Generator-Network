Embarrassing footage has emerged of a military vehicle delivered to the Ukraine from Britain seemingly incapable of driving up and over a small hill.

The  all-terrain Saxon could be seen trying and failing to get up and over a mound of earth in the war-torn country while a Russian-made amphibious patrol car completed the same task untroubled.

About 20 of the troop carriers were sent to the Ukrainian government by a private company under a 2013 deal which predated the current conflict.

Struggling: Footage has emerged of an all-terrain Saxon, sent to the Ukraine from Britain, trying and failing to drive over a small mound of earth

Last month, the former head of the British Army, General Sir Richard Dannatt slammed the decision to send dozens of the redundant British vehicles to the Ukraine claiming they were 'useless'.

He said in an interview: 'They are quite useless, semi-armoured lorries that should be nowhere near anyone's front line.

'To suggest that the UK is making a significant gesture of support by supplying vehicles which we took out of service ten years ago, because we deemed them unsafe, seems bizarre at best and downright dangerous at worst.'

First built in the late 1970s, Saxons were intended to be a cheap and efficient option for units making long journeys.

The first operational Saxons were sent to Germany in 1983 where they were used as troop transporters

The first operational Saxons were sent to Germany in 1983 where they were used as troop transporters.

They were taken out of service 10-years-ago. 

In February, a Ministry of Defence spokesman told the Daily Telegraph that the sale was organised through the Disposal Services authority and the vehicles were provided unarmed.

A spokesman from the British Ministry of Defence added that  20 had so far been delivered to Ukraine by a private company and a further 55 were still waiting to be delivered as part of a commercial arms deal. 

One of Poland's top politicians has called for a permanent US military presence on his country's soil.

The nation's defence minister Tomasz Siemoniak said Poland hoped to welcome more than 10,000 'allied armed forces' troops to take part in military exercise in 2015.

Uatoday, reports that this comes after the US Army deployed a Patriot missile defense battery near Warsaw.

The battery arrived in Poland along with 100 US soliders and about 30 vehicles.

Stephen Mull, US Ambassador to Poland is reported as saying: 'Today we demonstrate the United States ability to quickly deploy the Patriot missiles in Poland in case of necessity.

'We are here to show our Polish allies that American security guarantees for Poland within NATO mean much more than words on the paper.'

Licences for the sale were granted by an expert division within the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.

Last week images emerged showing a Saxon after it crashed on a motorway, killing the driver.

The Saxon had been on a training exercises on a highway linking the Ukrainian capital Kiev to the city of Kharkiv in the east when the driver lost control, and flipped over.

A Ukrainian military spokesman said: 'The soldiers being transported were unharmed but the driver was killed.

'We are carrying out an investigation to determine whether this was the fault of the driver or of the vehicle.'
