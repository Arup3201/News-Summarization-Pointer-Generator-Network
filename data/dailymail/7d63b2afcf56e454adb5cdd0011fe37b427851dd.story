Judge David Goodin, pictured, told Frederick Smith that his court was 'not in the business of passing cruel, degrading and inhumane sentences' at Ipswich Crown Court

A ‘vile’ 94 year-old who sexually abused a schoolgirl in a bus driver’s shack is believed to be the oldest sex offender ever to be jailed in the UK.

Frederick Smith used a Zimmer frame as he was escorted to the cells after a judge sent him to prison for a year.

The retired travel agent admitted four offences of indecent assault between 1972-1982 and one offence of indecency with a child between 1972-76.

Sentence had been adjourned to see if the prison service could accommodate his ‘extensive personal needs’.

Smith, of Haverhill, Suffolk, was described as ‘vile’ by Judge David Goodin.

He told him: 'As frail as you are, bent over your Zimmer frame, justice cries out that you be sent to prison for your crimes.

'This court is not in the business of passing cruel, degrading and inhumane sentences but to prison you must go.

'I’m told you have become depressed and withdrawn and I’m inclined to the view that at the age of 94 your remorse for what you have done is real.

'This court is not in the business of passing cruel, degrading and inhumane sentences but to prison you must go.

'I’m told you have become depressed and withdrawn and I’m inclined to the view that at the age of 94 your remorse for what you have done is real.

'You will carry the shame of your offending to your grave.'

Ipswich Crown Court heard that medical reports showed that Smith ‘wasn’t in bad shape’ for his age.

Smith's solicitor, Joanne Eley, asked Judge David Goodin at Ipswich Crown Court, pictured to consider an alternative to prison to 'allow him to end his life with some dignity'

The judge added: 'You need help with stairs, bathing and dressing but otherwise your memory is not bad and you can communicate clearly.'

He was taken to Norwich prison following the sentencing hearing.

Hugh Vass, prosecuting, said Smith’s crimes had a devastating and lasting effect on his victim.

She finally made a statement to police in July 2013 and described being abused some 40 years earlier in a shack used by bus drivers for refreshment breaks.

Smith got the schoolgirl to sit next to him and then touched her between the legs when one of his colleagues left the room.

She said Smith had sexually assaulted her on a number of occasions over a period of years and she had feared he would kill her if she said anything.

On one occasion she saw him in his garden and when she threatened to reveal what he had done he threw a pair of garden shears at her, narrowly missing her.

Smith had also sexually abused her while giving her a lift in his car and had got her to perform sex acts on him.

Joanne Eley, for Smith, said he was deeply remorseful and regretted what he had done, adding: 'He feels dirty and ashamed.'

She said that Smith had asked her to tell the court he knew he had done 'bad things' and was 'very, very sorry'.

She urged the judge to 'allow him to end his life with some dignity in a care home and not in the care of one of Her Majesty’s prisons'.
