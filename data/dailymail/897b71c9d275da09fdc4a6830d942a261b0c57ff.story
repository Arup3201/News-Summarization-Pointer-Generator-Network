An agricultural college has filmed a toe-curling gangster rap video featuring a Jennifer Lopez-lookalike in the hope of encouraging young people to consider a career in farming. 

The cringe-inducing video by Easton and Otley College in East Anglia features a hip hop version of  The Wurzles' novelty hit 'Combine Harvester, and students performing choreographed dance moves.

The college says it hopes the video - which has already been viewed more than 35,000 times on YouTube and features agricultural students bragging about their earnings - will make farming look cool and attract young people into a profession dominated by aging men.

The bizarre video features professional dancers Ricky Jinx and Jessica Jayne Stone, who was a body double for Jennifer Lopez.The rest of the cast, however, are students at the college.

Justifying the use of gangster rap in the clip, John Nice, spokesman for the college, said: 'We recently released a video that aims to get more young people interested in farming.

'The average age of a farmer in the UK is someone in their 50s. We want to show young people that there are good careers available working in agriculture.' 

Mr Nice added that he wanted people with no connection with farming to consider it as a career.

In true hip hop style, the video is packed with  braggadocio, with one of the students even rapping: 'I used to be on £10k but now I'm on 33!'

The college's director of marketing Clare Dyble said: 'We’ve been overwhelmed by the support we have received. 

Part of our long term aim is to attract more young people towards farming and landbased careers to counteract skills shortfalls in industries such as agriculture, construction and horticulture.' 

However the rest of the performers are all students at the popular agricultural college in East Anglia 

So far almost 40,000 people have watched the video which is going viral on YouTube 

This follows the cringeworthy video by Thorne Travel in Kilwinning, North Ayrshire featuring members of their staff power-walking down the town's high street.
