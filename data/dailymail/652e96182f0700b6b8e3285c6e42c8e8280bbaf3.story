A bungling tanker driver left dozens of motorists stranded and caused thousands of pounds worth of damage to their cars after accidentally putting diesel into an unleaded storage tank.

The driver caused around £14,000 worth of damage after the mix-up at a Sainsbury's petrol station forecourt in Salford, Manchester.

A total of 44 cars were affected - and now owners face bills of hundreds of pounds to get their engines fixed.

Bungling: The driver of the tanker caused around £14,000 worth of damage after the mix-up at a Sainsbury's forecourt in Salford, Manchester

Bosses at the Regent Road store in Salford closed the pumps when they discovered the mix-up. By then, reports were coming in of cars conking-out on the streets.

Sainsbury's apologised and has already agreed to cover the cost of repairs to the vehicles.

One of the car drivers, from Manchester, said the blunder had ruined a friend's birthday.

The 35-year-old had filled her Peugeot 3008 with £40 of the wrong fuel.She said: 'I drove away and the car felt strange but I thought it was just cold or something.

It was only 7.40am. I made it to work, but when I came back at lunchtime to go and meet my friend, it wouldn't start. I thought about phoning Peugeot and give them a hard time, but rang the AA instead.

'The man arrived and said they had had a call from Sainsbury's saying there had been a problem with the fuel.

'I was supposed to go out with a friend to a spa in Cheadle for her birthday. The whole afternoon was ruined.'

The mistake is believed to have happened during an early-morning delivery last week.

Garages across Salford reported brisk trade as affected motorists contacted them to fix their broken-down cars.

Tony Everall, owner of AL Everall on Blackfriar's Road, Salford, said: 'One woman brought in a Mini One. She had filled up at Sainsbury's and thought she had put petrol in.

'She got as far as Deansgate and the car started conking out. When we got it going, it started blowing smoke out the back like a James Bond car.'

An AA spokesman said the average repair for cleaning out a petrol tank contaminated with diesel was £330.

A Sainsbury's spokesman said: 'As soon as we became aware of this isolated and extremely rare incident we immediately closed the filling station.

'Our priority has been to ensure that our customers' cars are fixed and we have been in contact with those affected to arrange and cover all the costs for these repairs.

'We're very sorry for the inconvenience caused to these customers and we are working closely with our suppliers to help prevent this from happening again.'
