David Cameron is expected to announce the new policy for schools if the Conservatives stay in power today

Thousands of coasting state schools will be forced to become academies in an ‘all-out war on mediocrity’ if the Conservatives remain in power, David Cameron will say today.

Up to 3,500 primary and secondary schools judged to require improvement by watchdogs will be at risk of being taken over by new headteachers, backed by other successful academies or expert sponsors.

Downing Street sources said the policy represented a ‘turbo-charging’ of the existing academies programme started by Labour.

Currently only schools judged ‘inadequate’ can be converted against their will, while outstanding secondaries and primaries can apply for academy status, which affords them key freedoms from state control.

The move suggests the Tories now envisage that all schools will ultimately become academies, free from local authority control.

It also appears to be an attempt to drive another wedge between Ed Miliband and senior Blairites in his party, who have long despaired of how he has ceded ownership of the academies programme to the Coalition. The Tory election push on schools policy comes after Education Secretary Nicky Morgan indicated the party would protect her budget from austerity measures for another five years.

The Tories also plan to raise standards by making all schoolchildren in England learn their times tables by heart as well as carry out long division and complex multiplication by the age of 11. They will also have to be able to read a novel and write a short story.

Many schools already expect pupils to meet these targets, but all will be expected to pass tough tests before leaving primary school as part of a ‘war on illiteracy and innumeracy’.

Mr Cameron will say today: ‘As parents we’re hardwired to want the best for our kids. No one wants their child to go to a failing school – and no one wants to them to go to a coasting school either.

So this party is clear. “Just enough” is not good enough. That means no more sink schools – and no more “bog standard” schools either.

‘We’re waging an all-out war on mediocrity, and our aim is this: the best start in life for every child, wherever they’re from – no excuses.’

Labour allowed failing state schools to be converted into academies and taken over with new leadership, with impressive results.

The Coalition extended the policy by allowing the most successful schools to apply for academy status, which gives them freedom over their budgets, the national curriculum, term dates and staff pay.

Around half of all secondaries and one in ten primaries is now an academy.

Under a Conservative government, any school judged as ‘requires improvement’ would automatically be considered to become an academy.

Nicky Morgan indicated the Conservatives would protect her budget for schools in the next five years. Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt however said the policy was 'damaging the education system'

Only if they can set out a clear plan for rapid improvement, as judged by their Regional Schools Commissioner, would they remain under their existing leadership.

And any school judged as ‘requires improvement’ that is already an academy or a free school may be forced to accept a new sponsor.

Mrs Morgan said yesterday she believed more rigorous standards would propel England to the top of the class in European league tables for English and maths by 2020, as well as in the top five internationally – a significant leap from the current ranking of 23rd.

As well as demonstrating mathematical skills, 11-year-olds will have to pass a writing test by showing they can use ‘accurate punctuation, spelling and grammar’. Headteachers who fail to ensure the standards are met face being sacked if the Conservatives are returned to power, she indicated.

‘I think that’s what parents and families would expect as a minimum from our exam system,’ Mrs Morgan told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme.

‘We have to be ambitious for our young people, if we don’t get it right at primary then it becomes much harder for children to catch up when they are in secondary schools.’

Asked whether the schools budget will be protected, Mrs Morgan said: ‘We’re going to have more to say on schools funding very shortly but what I can say is that I am absolutely fighting for the schools budget to be protected.’

Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt said: ‘David Cameron’s flawed schools policy is damaging our education system and failing to close the learning gap between disadvantaged children and the rest.’
