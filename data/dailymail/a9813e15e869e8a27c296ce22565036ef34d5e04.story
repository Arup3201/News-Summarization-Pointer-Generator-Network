Formula One legend Michael Schumacher lost vital time in the hours following his ski accident because doctors at the scene made crucial mistakes, it was claimed by a German magazine today.

The detour his rescue helicopter made from Meribel where he fell to a local hospital allegedly made his condition worse because the trip to a specialist unit that would have taken 20 minutes in a direct flight ended up taking an hour.

Stern magazine in Germany claimed the decision to take Schumacher, 45, to a clinic at Moutiers rather than straight away to the University of Grenoble Hospital - where he is currently in his 109th day of a medically induced coma - was a huge mistake.

Stern claims to have a medical source in France for its page one exclusive tomorrow.

The claims are similar to those made by former Formula One doctor Gary Hartstein a fortnight ago.

'Too optimistic': A German magazine claims doctors made Michael Schumacher's condition worse because they misdiagnosed the severity of his injuries which meant he didn't go straight to a specialist unit

It claimed that doctors at the scene 
misdiagnosed the severity of the injuries of the motor racing giant. 
They were too 'optimistic,' said the magazine.

This was perhaps because Schumacher was conscious and seemed to be in full control of his senses while he was on the slope where he smashed his head on to rocks.

But later that night he underwent two emergency operations and, at one stage, doctors did not think he would last until morning.

'Lost time always further increases the risk for the patient in such cases,' said the magazine in a lengthy report about the accident he suffered on a ski-run on December 29 and its immediate aftermath.

'It is recognised in medical research that every minute counts in such a serious brain injury until the proper care can be accessed and for him that is the specialised section of the Grenoble clinic.'Â 

It said the time taken to land in 
Moutiers to get the Formula One star intubated for a ventilator 'made 
Schumacher`s condition rapidly worsen' during the next flight to 
Grenoble and that such a procedure should have been carried out before 
the helicopter lifted off from the slopes.

It
 said his condition 'dramatically and rapidly' deteriorated on this 
second flight, requiring more time at Grenoble for computer scans and 
surgery than would otherwise have been the case.

The Moutiers hospital says he became comatose on the flight and needed to be treated for the onward journey.

The claims are similar to one made by Mr Hartstein, the former chief doctor of Formula One, who claimed Schumacher lost vital hours because he was airlifted to the 'wrong' hospital.

He said earlier this month that he believes this decision could have majorly affected his chances of recovery.

He told The Sun: 'You do not take patients with a suspected head injury to hospitals that do not have neuro-surgical capability.'

Hartstein, who was F1 sport's chief doctor between 2005 and 2012, said he had learned of 'serious lapses of judgement' in Schumacher's care and that the world is witnessing the long goodbye of motorsport's legendary figure.

Hartstein says he had heard from 'usually
 impeccable sources' to say that these lapses 'could, and almost 
certainly did, worsen the outcome in Michael's case.'

Stern also called into question the safety of helmets such as that used by Schumacher which split in two when he hit the hidden rock in snow on the fateful day of the accident.

'For accidents like this the protection of commercially available ski helmets is not sufficient by far', it said.

'Many winter sports enthusiasts weigh in on false security - but a fall from a height of 75 cm can destroy a helmet that accords with European specifications.'

At the weekend, Sabine Kehm, his manager, told a German TV programme of the 'small steps' he is allegedly showing as doctors battle to bring him around from the coma.

But halfway through his fourth month in such a state, there are many medical experts in the world who think that Schumacher may be in a 'waking coma' where he can open his eyes but do nothing else.

The French high mountain police referred all calls to the local prefecture, where a spokesman said: 'The matter remains the subject of investigation, and it would not be appropriate to comment at this stage.'

A Meribel Town Hall spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
