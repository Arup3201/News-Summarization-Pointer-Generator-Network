Thrilled: Helena Bonham Carter is made a CBE in the New Year Honours list

Helena Bonham Carter tops the bill for showbusiness honours as she is made a CBE.

The Oscar-nominated actress is recognised for her services to drama following her performance as the Queen Mother in The King’s Speech.

She is joined by Ronnie Corbett, who is also appointed a CBE, writer and  broadcaster Clive James, CBE, TV presenter Lorraine Kelly, OBE, former It’s A Knockout host Stuart Hall, OBE, and actor David  Harewood, MBE.

Miss Bonham Carter, 45, said she will accept her appointment in memory of her father, Raymond, who died in 2004 after many years of serious illness following a brain tumour.

She added: ‘I am thrilled, though not sure that I deserve it.

‘I always thought my father deserved a medal for facing 25 years of chronic disability with quiet daily heroism so I am delighted to accept such a wonderful honour in his memory.

‘I am wondering does it mean I get to command, because at the moment it’s my four-year-old daughter who does the commanding in our household. Must inform her of the change in situation.’

The mother of two made her Hollywood breakthrough 25 years ago with her role in A Room With  A View.

Since then, she has appeared in blockbusters including Fight Club, Alice in Wonderland and Planet Of The Apes – where she met her partner, film director Tim Burton.

Famed for her eccentric style of dressing, all eyes will be on her when she meets the Queen – who is said to have enjoyed the actress’s portrayal of her late mother.

Ronnie Corbett’s CBE will go alongside the OBE he was awarded by the Queen in 1978 along with his long-term comedy partner  Ronnie Barker.

Proud moment: Lorraine Kelly's OBE was awarded for services to charity and the Armed Forces

The 81-year-old is rewarded for his services to entertainment and to charity after more than 50 years on TV screens.

Previously, the diminutive star  questioned why there were not  more talented entertainers receiving honours.

Lorraine Kelly’s OBE was awarded for services to charity and the Armed Forces.

The 52-year-old former GMTV  presenter launched UK Armed Forces Day in Edinburgh this year. Last night she said: ‘I’m so thrilled and deeply honoured.’

Starting her career in journalism on her local paper, the East Kilbride News, she soon moved to broadcasting, becoming Scotland correspondent for TVam.

Happy: Stuart Hall's OBE is for services to broadcasting and charity

The mother of one has supported a number of charities including  Poppyscotland, Freedom from Fistula and the Muscle Help Foundation, as well as raising money for Comic Relief.

Clive James, who arrived in Britain from Australia in 1962, receives his CBE for services to literature and the media.

A father of two, he is married to academic Prue Shaw. He was diagnosed with leukaemia, kidney failure and lung disease in 2010, but is now recovering and continuing his work.

Stuart Hall’s OBE is for services to broadcasting and charity. The 82-year-old presenter, who hosted It’s A Knockout for ten years in the 1970s and 1980s, continues to work as a sports reporter for BBC Radio 5 Live.

David Harewood receives his MBE after starring in the ITV series The Vice and portraying Nelson Mandela in a one-off BBC drama.

The 46-year-old also played Martin Luther King in the stage production of The Mountaintop, which won Best New Play at the Olivier Awards and has recently transferred to Broadway with Samuel L Jackson playing the lead role.

He told the Daily Mail: ‘I’m absolutely chuffed and nearly fell off my chair when I read the letter.’
