Two heterosexual men have tied the knot on Friday morning under New Zealand's liberal marriage laws.

Marrying not for love, but for Rugby World Cup Tickets, the two men from Dunedin in the South Island of New Zealand officially said 'I do' in front of 60 family and friends.

The ceremony was live broadcast by Edge Radio, who's 'I Love You, Man' competition was launched earlier this year in a bid to find two straight men willing to wed for the sought after tickets.

'It's official folks, Travis and Matt have just said 'I do'! Congrats to the happy couple!,' the station tweeted. 

McIntosh and McCormick wed this morning as part of a competition to win tickets to the Rugby World Cup

Travis McIntosh, 23, and Matt McCormick, 24, won the 'bromantic' radio contest in August and are over the moon- not for a life together, but for the opportunity to head to the Rugby World Cup in England next year.

While some gay rights groups in New Zealand have voiced objections to the nuptials, the pair are content with their reasons for the wedding. 

McIntosh, an engineer, and McCormick, a teacher, have known each other for nearly 20 years, and see the wedding as a celebration of their friendship rather than a political statement. 

The newlyweds spoke to Daily Mail Australia, taking time out from their wedding reception to walk through their experience. 

'We entered the competition as a way of taking our friendship to the next level,' said Travis. 

The men met at the Pirates Rugby Club in Dunedin when they were six years old, and have been friends ever since. 

'Matt called me and asked me to marry him and I said yes without first asking why. I knew he'd have a good reason.' 

The pair wed in front of 60 friends and family in a 'hilarious' ceremony

While some gay rights groups have spoken out against the marriage, they have felt 'love and support'

'We had to explain it to our families several times, but they're all quite open minded and we've been overwhelmed by the love and support we've experience from our community.'

A spokesperson from The Edge explained that as with any event that pushes boundaries, there was bound to be a bit of backlash.

Local gay rights groups have condemned the wedding, protesting that it 'trivializes what we've fought for,' according to the New Zealand Herald. 

LegaliseLove Aotearoa Wellington co-chairman Joseph Habgood said the competition made clear that men marrying each other was 'something they think is worth having a laugh at.' 

However, McCormick and McIntosh have explained that their friendship was one of the main motivators in the process, and that it has been strengthened through the trials and challenges which lead them to their big day.

'We had to be very vulnerable with one another,' said Matt.

'Through the official proposal and preparing for the wedding we've spent so much time together, and we've had to share a lot of intimate details with one another.'

Mike Peru, one of the hosts of The Edge and a gay man himself, said that he knew that there would be some objection, but as time went by he realised that 'this was a fun event,'

'It’s not that I'm a spokesperson for the gay community, but when you’re out people do look to you for opinions,'

'But its been fine and I just relaxed into and took it for what it was. I think the gay community has too for the most part,'

The pair will not be living together but aren't sure what the future will bring

'In New Zealand the argument seems to be that  if two people want to get married it's no skin off anyone’s nose,'

'So two blokes can have an immense friends and strong bond, and I guess some of them would like to be married,'

'I think it's a good thing to celebrate bromance in quirky way, and Matt and Travis really epitomised that.'

For Matt and Travis, the details of the day made it something to look forward to. 

Matt and Travis all suited up to wed as part of the 'I Love You, Man' radio competition

'All of our mates and family came up for the wedding which has been amazing,'

'We had so much fun with it all. We got kitted out in amazing suits and Trevor walked down the aisle to Cruisin'.'

The wedding was a very male populated event, with each of the pair having a best man.

Looking to the future, the pair are mainly focused on heading to next year's Rugby World Cup in England, saying that they 'bleed black'.

After a honeymoon on the Cook Islands, life will return to normal for the non-traditional newlyweds.

Neither has a girlfriend or partner, which Matt says 'makes life easier. The wedding won't impede on our lives too much,'

'We're going to play things by ear. While we're not living together at the moment, we have before, so we'll see how it's all going in a year or so.'

The two friends, who have known each other for almost 20 years, are looking to see what the future holds

'We're certainly not ready to start a family.' 

The Edge's host Mike said that the ceremony was filled with good laughs.

'They're such funny guys so the ceremony was hilarious,'

'Everyone took it for what it was, and forgot the whole reason for why they were getting married. It was just a celebration of their friendship.'
