Channel 4 is facing furious demands to axe a controversial drama that hijacks a real terrorist murder of a senior Tory MP for entertainment.

The family of Airey Neave are fighting to ban the fictional thriller, which uses genuine  news footage of the car bomb that killed him in the Commons car park, from being aired tomorrow.

Producers of the drama Utopia pretend that his 1979 death was perpetrated by a secret MI5 cell, when in fact he was murdered by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), an IRA splinter group.

Slurs: Airey  Neave is shown drinking and plotting in Channel 4's Utopia

His devastated family – who were not consulted by the channel – last night said they were intending to take action after learning how the prime-time series had  fictionalised the atrocity ‘in the name of entertainment’ as well as falsely depicting him as a debauched and conniving figure.

The drama muddies the line between fact and fiction, drawing heavily on debunked conspiracy theories that Mr Neave – a war hero who escaped Colditz – was assassinated by the Government.

The programme includes genuine footage showing the blood-stained wreckage of Mr Neave’s car, paramedics racing to save his life and Margaret Thatcher’s reaction to news of the murder of her close ally and confidant, lending the fiction a veneer of credibility.

Mr Neave’s youngest son William, 60, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I am upset and I would dearly like to protect my father’s reputation from lies and fabrication.

'It seems that when somebody dies, people can say whatever they like. We would love to stop it from airing.’ Norman Tebbit – a close friend and colleague of Airey Neave who himself survived an IRA bomb – said: ‘To attack a man like that who is dead and cannot defend himself is despicable.’

In the first episode of Utopia’s  second series, which airs tomorrow  at 10pm, Mr Neave – played by Blackadder’s Tim McInnerny – is portrayed as a hard-drinking double-dealer who connives with spies.

Downing red wine over lunch, he is seen striking a murky deal with the security services to bring down Jim Callaghan’s Government by silencing a prominent Labour MP – by whatever means necessary.

William, a Lloyd’s underwriter  who was 26 when his father was murdered, added: ‘I don’t know why Channel 4 would want to make such sensationalist claims when they are just not true.

'The suggestion that my father was a drinker is particularly upsetting and utterly dishonest. After his heart attack in 1959, he gave up drinking altogether. We may well have to take action over this.’

William’s brother Patrick, 66, branded the drama an ‘utter travesty and a cynical, money-making exercise’, adding: ‘Who do these people think they are, reinventing history for the purpose of entertainment? To show real-life footage of my father’s death is in incredibly poor taste, real in-the-gutter stuff.

‘We will be sending a very terse message of disapproval to the head of Channel 4. They didn’t even have the courtesy to contact us about this. That is the very least they should have done.

‘This is nothing  more than propaganda. Channel 4 is watched by  people in their 20s and 30s. They will think this mock history is the truth. That is  monstrous and wrong.’

Patrick’s wife Elizabeth, 61, added: ‘This is appalling – we all want to get  it stopped. My father-in-law was a dear and able man. He was not a drinker and he was most certainly not killed by MI5.

'We will do all that we can to shut this series down. Frankly, it is disgusting that anyone would think that slurring a man’s character and reputation in the so-called name of entertainment is remotely appropriate.’

Mr Neave’s eldest child Marigold, 70, also called for the programme to be cancelled, saying: ‘We are not happy at all and I would like to see it banned because I don’t see any point in it. The man portrayed is not the man I knew.’

David Ray, the secretary of the  Colditz Society, added: ‘Channel 4 has crossed the line. Airey Neave was a war hero, the first Englishman to get back from Colditz. He had a fine record.

'I am very saddened to hear this drama is going out. It’s terrible that a great man’s name should  be dragged through the mud.’

The script weaves conspiracy with real life. Mr Neave, who was Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary at the time, was killed just two days after the vote of no confidence which brought down Callaghan.

In 2005, Utopia creator Dennis Kelly wrote a stage play Osama The Hero, about a teenager in thrall to Al Qaeda.

But he is best known for writing Matilda The Musical with comedian Tim Minchin and BBC3 sitcom Pulling with Sharon Horgan, who quipped of the show: ‘There isn’t a moral centre because Dennis and I don’t have one.’

Kelly himself admitted of Utopia: ‘I’m capable of being a c***, a not very nice person.’

The vote would have made Mr Neave Northern Ireland Secretary. The INLA killed him because they believed he would have brought their ‘armed struggle to its knees’.

But on screen, Mr Neave is silenced by The Network, a fictional, secret clique within the intelligence community, to prevent him from revealing  its existence.

The drama also suggests that Sir Richard Sykes – the British Ambassador to the Netherlands who was shot dead by the IRA just a week before Mr Neave’s assassination – was killed by security services for the same reason.

Again, genuine news footage of  the diplomat’s killing is used, with a graphic shot of a pool of Sir Richard’s blood shown after an agent is told: ‘Deal with Sykes.’  

Laura Sykes, 56, the wife of Sir  Richard’s son Andrew, said: ‘The family has been made aware of the programme but we do not wish to comment.’

The episode ends with an agent from The Network, played by Downton Abbey’s Rose Leslie, admitting responsibility for Nr Neave’s murder. Perversely, the 27-year-old actress has even suggested the fiction is, in fact, a ‘history lesson’.

She said: ‘The political intrigue, the way the Airey Neave story is woven in, it’s brilliant.

‘It was a real history lesson for me as well. I was embarrassed about how little I knew of the 1970s.’

Claims that Mr Neave was killed by the security services were first raised by Kevin Cahill, an Irish journalist, who believes the politician was killed by MI6 agents working with the CIA because he was about to expose corrupt, senior members of the intelligence community.

But Lord Carlile, a counter-terrorism expert, said: ‘There’s no evidence to support these spurious conspiracy theories. They were totally discredited at the time.

‘All right-minded people always realised it was just tittle-tattle. It is incredibly offensive to the family of Airey Neave to give these claims oxygen again.’

A Channel 4 spokesperson said: ‘The drama series Utopia is entirely fictional.

'A conspiracy thriller about a fictional organization called The Network, Utopia occasionally blends real moments in history with fictional storylines, and therefore some events and characters have been adapted for dramatic licence.

'It was not our intention to cause offence and Utopia does not suggest that any other real organisation was responsible for the death of Airey Neave.

That period in history has been both widely reported and dramatized over the last 35 years and is the subject of many conspiracy theories.'

Norman Tebbit and his wife Margaret narrowly avoided death  when Brighton’s Grand Hotel was blown up by the IRA during the 1984 Tory Party conference, killing five and leaving Margaret requiring a wheelchair.

Here he describes his ‘disgust’ over Channel 4 using Airey Neave’s murder for entertainment.

I struggle to find the words  to describe the extent of my disgust at the piece of so-called television drama concerning my dear, late friend Airey Neave, on Channel 4.

If reports that they are proposing to use real news footage of his cruel murder by Irish terrorists are accurate, it must surely mark a new low point in British broadcasting.

It is a nauseating example of the victory of greed and sensationalism over respect for the dead, over  the feelings of the loved ones of  those who have died, and over that derided old-fashioned quality, decency.

Anger: Lord and Lady Tebbit

I had the privilege of knowing Airey Neave, a man who showed the kind of bravery and dedication to his country that is alien to broadcasters in cynical pursuit of titillation, higher ratings and money.

In a bygone world, a man of Neave’s honour would have challenged  the film maker to a duel. Sadly,  Airey is not around to throw down the gauntlet.

To trash his reputation in this way is bad enough, but to do it to a man who is dead and cannot defend himself is despicable.

I have a much better film idea for Channel 4. It has all the drama and excitement they like. It is about the first British officer to escape Colditz, who nearly starved to death on the way back to Britain as he avoided the Germans, but made it in one piece, who spent the rest of the war directing the operation that enabled other heroic PoWs to negotiate the same perilous route back home and was awarded the Military Cross.

A man who played an important role in the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals, became an MP, survived a heart attack, was among a small band of far-sighted and self-effacing politicians who saw the remarkable talent of a grocer’s daughter from Grantham, helped her save the country and was rewarded for all this by being blown to bits in the House of Commons itself by terrorists.

A film about this story was made many years ago, but a new one would be most welcome. The star, Airey Neave. There is only problem: every word is true, so I doubt Channel 4  will be interested.
