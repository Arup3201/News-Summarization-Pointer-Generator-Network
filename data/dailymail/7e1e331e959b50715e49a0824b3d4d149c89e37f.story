With its rear bumper almost touching the dusty road as it buckles under the heavy load, its clear the car's passengers are determined not to leave anything behind as they abandon their African village facing rebel attack.

The former yellow taxi was laden down with over a dozen sacks and at least 11 occupants including seven on its roof - as it was driven away from Damara, the  last strategic town between the rebels from the SELEKA coalition  and the Central African Republic's capital Bangui.

The commander of the regional African
force FOMAC warned rebels against trying to take the town, saying it 
would 'amount to a declaration of war.'

The rebels, who began their campaign a
month ago and have taken several key towns and cities, have accused 
Central African Republic leader Francois Bozize of failing to honor a 
2007 peace deal.

Yesterday the president of Central 
African Republic consolidated military power under his control after dismissing his own son as acting defense minister along with his 
army chief of staff.

President
Francois Bozize said in a decree read on state radio late Wednesday 
that he was taking over the position held by his son, Jean Francis 
Bozize as neighboring countries sent troops to help.

Hundreds
of soldiers from Chad, Republic of Congo, Gabon and Cameroon have been 
in arriving this week in this desperately poor, landlocked country where
rebels have seized 10 towns in a month's time

Military backup: Soldiers of the regional African force FOMAC arrive in Damara. The sign reads in French 'The seductive city of Damara welcomes you and wishes you a pleasant stay'

Rebel
spokesman Col. Djouma Narkoyo reiterated Thursday that they were 
holding their position at the transportation hub of Sibut pending 
negotiations in Gabon. They have apparently made no further advance 
toward the capital since taking the town on Dec. 29.

'Our
position today is that we respect the decision of the Economic 
Community of Central African States,'he said by satellite phone. 'That's
why we are staying in Sibut and are not advancing.'

In
New York, France's U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud said there will be a 
meeting in Libreville, Gabon on Jan. 8 to promote a political solution 
to the crisis, mediated by President Denis Sassou Nguesso of the 
Republic of Congo.

'The 
goal is to have a political agreement in Libreville, a national unity 
government ... and eventually a peaceful settlement,'he told reporters 
after a closed-door briefing to the U.N. Security Council Thursday on 
the latest developments in the Central African Republic by U.N. 
political chief Jeffrey Feltman.

Poised: Chadian soldiers wait on a truck near the Damara, the last strategic town between the rebels from the SELEKA coalition and the country's capital Bangui

Araud
said the African Union and regional groups are in the lead and have 
been very active, and the Security Council is supporting them and will 
likely issue a press statement Friday. He said France planned to 
circulate the text to the 14 other council members on Thursday evening.

'They
have stopped the rebels, and they have ideas about a national unity 
government,'Araud said of the AU and regional groups. 'So everything 
will be discussed in the meeting in Libreville on the 8th, and after the
meeting in Libreville we'll see whether the U.N. has to do something.'

Residents
in the capital of Bangui said Bozize's decision to fire his own son was
not surprising given the recent military losses. But some noted Bozize 
may be making his moves too late.

'It's
coming too late because the security of our country is already in the 
hands of rebels,'said Jean Nestor Kongbu as he watched fishermen cast 
their nets in the Obangui River that separates Central African Republic 
from Congo. ... They say they won't advance, but the government could 
provoke the rebels or the rebels could provoke the government. They need
to negotiate for the Central African people.'

Back-up: The final contingent of reinforcements under current deployment plans load their equipment into trucks after arriving to bolster FOMAC at the airport in Bangui, Central African Republic

Preparation: A group of around forty soldiers from Cameroon load up a truck of their arrival to offer support

The
sudden military reorganization also suggests that Bozize's regime may 
be weakening, said Thierry Vircoulon, the project director for Central 
Africa at the International Crisis Group.

'If he is dismissing his own son, it means he is getting more and more isolated,'Vircoulon said.

Jennifer
Cooke, director of the Africa program at the Washington-based Center 
for Strategic and International Studies, said people see Bozize 'as a 
losing ticket right now.'

'People
are losing confidence in him and he has every reason to be a bit 
paranoid right now watching the disintegration of the country,'she said.

The United Nations called 
for talks between the government and rebels and the Security Council 
scheduled closed consultations on the Central African Republic on 
Thursday afternoon.

The 
rebels have indicated they will participate in upcoming talks in Gabon 
but are also insisting that Bozize go. The president says he will not 
leave before finishing his term in 2016.

Bozize
himself took power in 2003 following a rebellion with the help of 
Chadian forces. He later went on to win elections in 2005 and 2011, 
though the opposition and international observers have called the votes 
deeply flawed.

The rebels 
behind the latest challenge to Bozize's rule are made up of four 
separate groups all known by their French acronyms - UFDR, CPJP, FDPC 
and CPSK.

They are 
collectively known as Seleka, which means alliance in the local Sango 
language, but have previously fought one another. In September 2011, 
fighting between the CPJP and the UFDR left at least 50 people dead in 
the town of Bria and more than 700 homes destroyed.
