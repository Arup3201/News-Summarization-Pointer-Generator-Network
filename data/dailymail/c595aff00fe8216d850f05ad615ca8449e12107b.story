Up until now, it's been a long and arduous journey for Anjali Rao.

The high demands of her role as a CNN breakfast anchor based in Hong Kong was wearing her down to the bone - literally.

But the 40-year-old is happy to report that she now calls Australia home with a new job, a new outlook on life and new found love.

The journalist was once living the dream.

She had a high flying job, interviewing the likes of Bill Clinton and the Dalai Lama, while living very comfortably in Hong Kong and enjoying married life with the exciting prospect of having her first child.

'It's incredibly upsetting when month after month you just fail. That was it. I felt like a failure. Not loving my job any more, feeling like I had all these people relying on me and failing to have a child. I ended up with a very black head space,' she told Sunday Life.

But even the birth of her son Izzy, after years of IVF, failed to bring Rao joy.

The stresses of covering traumatic events, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake, proved to be too much as her health rapidly deteriorated.

She developed an eating disorder and lost 30 kilograms in a few months.

So the mother-of-one made the call to quit her job and relocate to Melbourne, Australia which was the home of her husband and graphic designer Brett Gullan.

But this posed more challenges for the TV presenter.

'The hardest thing I've ever done was to leave my marriage. At the time I thought I needed a completely clean break ... a new country, a new network, to head up a new vein of journalism. But looking back, what I needed was a rest,' she said.

The life that she knew was gone.

But things were slowly starting to fall back into place.

A few months into her resettlement, Rao was offered a role as a guest panellist on Channel Ten's The Project which helped her secure a spot as the host of Dateline on SBS.

With new found purpose, her health is back on track and so is her love life.

The anchor is currently dating celebrity gardener Jamie Durie, after first meeting him at Melbourne's Spring Racing Carnival in November.

'This is not something I've ever experienced before and I was certainly not looking for. We often say to each other, "Can you believe it's only been this long?" To us it feels like years. It was an instant connection that I've never felt before,' she said.

Rao now divides her time between Melbourne and Sydney, which is where 43-year-old Durie lives.

The former cabaret performer has an 18-year-old daughter, Taylor, with Las Vegas showgirl Michelle Gennock.
