Karen Johnson had an allergic reaction from paint sold by B&Q that contains the chemical Methylisothiazolinone

A mother-of-two has claimed she is allergic to her living room after she painted it seven months ago.

Karen Johnson says she breaks out in a rash every time she goes into the room to watch television after using white emulsion paint from B & Q. on the walls.

Ms Johnson, 52, from Deptford, South East London, said she cannot sit in her front room for more than a couple of hours, and once had such a severe reaction that she had to be rushed to hospital.

It is believed she is suffering a reaction to a chemical preservative called Methylisothiazolinone (MI or 
MIT), which is routinely added to household products such as paint - as well as moisturisers, sun creams, shampoos and wet 
wipes.

The receptionist told the Sun: 'It is a nightmare now as I have really bad reactions whenever I come into contact with MI and it is in everything - hand wash, shampoo, washing up liquid.

'I still cannot sit in my front room for more than a few hours without getting a rash.'

Skin
 experts in the UK and around the world have picked up a large number of
 allergic reactions they believe are caused by the chemical.

In
 December, Cosmetics Europe, the European cosmetics trade association, 
told its members to remove MI from products that are left on the skin - 
but at the moment there are no laws stating that it has to be displayed 
on the labels of paints.

In
 a statement, the body said: ‘This action is recommended in the 
interests of consumer safety in relation to adverse skin reactions.

‘It
 is recommended that companies do not wait for regulatory intervention 
under the Cosmetics Regulation but implement this recommendation as soon
 as feasible.’

Symptoms 
ranged from a rash of bright red tiny bumps to fluid filled lumps on the
 skin, blisters, itchy eyes and even a severely swollen face.

British skin experts say the scale of 
the allergic reactions to the chemical, which has been used increasingly
 since 2005,  has been alarming.

Dermatologists
 expect an allergic reaction to a cosmetic product of no more than 
1-2per cent, however British clinics report that the rate has been more 
than 10per cent for MI.

It
 is claimed that scale of harm is more than twice the level of another 
ingredient called MDBGN (methydibromo glutaronitrile), which was banned 
by the European Commission in 2008.

A B &Q spokesman said: 'Customer 
safety is always the highest priority for B&Q. We take the greatest 
care in formulating products that conform to the highest quality 
standards and are safe for their intended use.

Ms Johnson, 52, from Deptford, South East London, said she cannot sit in her front room for more than a couple of hours, and once had such a severe reaction that she had to be rushed to hospital

Methylisothiazolinone
 (MIT or MI) is an ingredient which is widely used in paints and raw 
materials used in the preparation of paints. 

'The level of MIT in B&Q products 
complies with all regulatory and best standard practice for the use of 
this ingredient. The use of Methylisothiazolinone is controlled by 
European regulations and the concentration used in B&Q paint 
products is below the limit recommended for paints by the European 
Union.

'In advance of the 
2015 CLP Directive, which comes into force in June 2015, B&Q is 
rolling out updated labeling across all paint products to include the 
following statement: Contains Benz/Methyl/Chlormethyl-Isothiazolon. May 
produce an allergic reaction (preservatives).

'We
 sincerely sympathise with Mrs Johnson’s claim but understand that she 
was unaware of her sensitivity to MIT when she purchased the paint, and 
so, in this instance, labelling would not have helped her.'
