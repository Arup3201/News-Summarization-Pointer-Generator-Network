A car fire which left a young boy fighting for his life, and his mother and sister seriously injured, was today being treated as attempted murder as police wait to question the mother involved.

The five-year-old boy and a six-year-old girl were dragged from the blaze by brave passers-by after the vehicle exploded into flames.

Detectives today said the fire, which occurred on Merdon Castle Lane near Winchester, Hampshire on Monday was 'not a random incident' and they were 
satisfied they had 'identified all of those involved.'

A five-year-old boy is fighting for his life and his mother and sister have been seriously injured after their car exploded into a fireball

The schoolboy was airlifted to hospital, where today he remained in a life-threatening condition.

His sister and mother, aged 37, were also still in hospital and were described as being in a serious condition. No arrests have been made at this time.

The children’s mother was due to be questioned by officers in her hospital bed when she was well enough.

Police are not seeking anyone else in relation to the incident.

Detective
 Inspector Simon Baker from Hampshire Police’s Major Investigation Team,
 said: 'This is now being treated as an attempted murder investigation. 
Our priority is to establish how this fire started.

'We are keeping an open mind and considering all the options at this stage including whether the fire was started deliberately.

'We
 also have to take into consideration that the people involved are all 
being treated in hospital and we have to balance our investigation with 
their medical needs, so establishing the full circumstances of what has 
happened may take some time.

'Our
 inquiries so far indicate that this was not a random incident and we 
are satisfied that we have identified all of those involved in the 
investigation.'

Eye witnesses described seeing the children trapped inside the car, while the panic-stricken mother stood close by.

Alan Beusmans and his son William were first at the scene of a horrific fireball.

'It was well alight and there were two people in the road, a woman and a
 young girl,' said Mr Beusmans, a 64-year-old grandfather of three.

'We thought we’d run to assist the lady, who had flames coming up around her legs.

'She was pointing towards the car and that’s when I saw the other kid.

'I went over to the car and managed to get the door open - the boy was pressed up against the window.

'I burnt my hand opening it and the boy fell out of the car, I got him over to the other side.

'They were very distressed and I was shocked at what I saw but I managed to get myself together.

'You never expect anything like this to happen.'

The three injured were all from Southampton.

Today
 specially-trained officers were continuing to support them and their 
family. Officers have named the investigation into the incident 
Operation Ursa.
