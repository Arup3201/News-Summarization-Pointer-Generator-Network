A furious resident has had scaffolding erected at his house after workmen had a mix-up with their sat nav.

Bob Sadler from Barkway, Hertfordshire, returned home this week to find the structure encasing his home.

His mother-in-law had spotted the workmen and told them they had got the wrong house.

The wrong house: Furious Bob Sadler came home to find his home covered in unwanted scaffolding

However when she went to tell them, 
the scaffolders told her to go away and rang their boss who told them 
just to go ahead with it.

The
blunder is the latest in a string of mishaps on Mr Sadler’s street, 
including wrongly delivered televisions, bailiff notices, beds and 
cookers.

The mix-ups on Windmill Close started three years ago when another Windmill Close was built just eight miles away.

Both streets have an SG8 postcode and many online maps, including Google, and sat navs show the newly built one when the older one in Bassingbourn is searched for.

Mr Sadler said: ‘It has been ridiculous for a while. We’ve been getting things for a long time now which aren’t for us.’

He phoned the people the scaffolding was intended for and asked them to sort out the problem. He does not know who put it up as they did not leave any note or acknowledgement.

Another resident on the street, who asked not to be named, said she had been mistakenly threatened with action from bailiffs.

The fed-up mother said that she and her neighbours have had beds, mattresses and electrical goods wrongly delivered to their houses.

‘I’ve had more than enough now - we are all just sick of it,’ she said. ‘It’s just got to the point where we don’t know what to do. I just want this to be sorted out. But the problem is that a lot of people are using sat navs these days. And as they are not programmed to accept that new address everything comes here instead.’

The correct address: Windmill Close in Bassingbourn, where the scaffolding was supposed to go in the first place

The Royal Mail said the problem lay with individual companies and sat nav providers.

A spokesman said that all the details, including postcodes and road names, were correct on its database, which was also accessible by visiting its website.

He said: ‘Unfortunately, not everybody updates their own records. It would be their responsibility to do so. We have the correct records available.’

Source of the confusion: Windmill Close in Bassingbourn and Windmill Close in Barkway are just eight miles apart
