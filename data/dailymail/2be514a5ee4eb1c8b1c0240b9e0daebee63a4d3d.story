Chelsea are furious with the FA after they failed to punish Burnley’s Ashley Barnes for his terrible tackle on Nemanja Matic.

The FA confirmed on Monday that blunder referee Martin Atkinson — who has been omitted from this weekend’s matchlist — claims to have seen that incident and Barnes’s kick at Branislav Ivanovic.

Jose Mourinho and the Chelsea board will demand a modification of the rules relating to retrospective punishments after Barnes escaped further action.

Reports on Monday night claimed that Premier League delegate Steve Greaves, who was at Saturday’s 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge to assess Atkinson, agreed with the referee on the four contentious decisions which most angered Mourinho.

Burnley manager Sean Dyche, unhappy that his player’s conduct has been highlighted by Mourinho in such a public way, issued a video statement in defence of Barnes and said the challenge was made to look worse by slow-motion replays.

Dyche said: ‘I find it hard to believe that all these people, including the Chelsea manager, using very strong phrases didn’t have any reaction at all at that live moment,’ he said.

That will not stop Matic continuing with his appeal against his three-match ban for the shove that followed Barnes’s tackle in an attempt to play in Sunday’s Capital One Cup final against Tottenham.

Matic has appealed based on ‘excessive punishment’ and Chelsea are expected to present views of former players — including Sky Sports analyst Gary Neville and the BBC’s Alan Shearer — claiming their player was entitled to react.

The FA’s three-man independent commission will sit today and a decision on Matic’s punishment is expected this afternoon.

Mourinho claims Barnes should have been sent off and criticised his conduct by referring to him as ‘a player, if you can call him that’.

It has emerged that Chelsea captain John Terry showed team-mates stud marks down his legs, allegedly from a tackle by Barnes, and is understood to have brought a rogue elbow to his eye socket, again apparently from Barnes, to the attention of Atkinson during the game.

The match official, who booked just three players during one of the feistiest games in the Premier League this season, took no action. He has been left off this weekend’s referees’ match list and will be the fourth official for Manchester United’s home game against Sunderland.

Mourinho, who was fined £25,000 by the game’s governing body for claiming there is a ‘campaign’ against his club after their draw with Southampton last year, will not be punished for his latest comments. He was unhappy about the Matic incident, Barnes’s challenge on Ivanovic and two penalty appeals that were turned down.

His appearance on Sky’s Goals on Sunday has provoked widespread debate about the rules governing retrospective punishments and the FA went to some lengths to explain them on Monday.

An FA spokesman said: ‘Retrospective action was introduced as a deterrent for off-the-ball incidents (eg. kicks, stamps, etc) committed out of sight of officials. In line with this rationale, the FA confirm no further action in relation to Ashley Barnes as the incident was seen by the officials.’
