Two members of the England cricket team’s disastrous Ashes campaign in Australia were heroes at last yesterday.

Wicketkeeper Matt Prior and bowler Stuart Broad saved a Briton threatening to jump to his death from a bridge in Sydney.

They dragged him from railings above Darling Harbour and spent an hour talking to him to calm him down.

Dramatic ending: England cricketers Matt Prior and Stuart Broad stopped an English man from committing suicide by preventing him from jumping from a Sydney bridge in the early hours of Wednesday morning

Scene: The Pyrmont Bridge in Darling Harbour where Prior and Broad stumbled across an English man threatening to jump

The incident happened in the early 
hours yesterday as the two players and the team’s security officer Terry
 Minish were returning to their hotel from a fans’ charity event.

Prior,
 31, is said to have spotted the man on the ledge of Pyrmont Bridge. He 
had taken off his shoes and thrown his telephone, passport and wallet 
into the water.

After
 starting a conversation with him, Prior and Mr Minish were forced into 
action when the man looked as though he was about to jump to his death.

Broad
 and Prior then talked with the man, who told them he was from 
Cheltenham, for almost an hour in a bid to calm him down while they 
waited for the police to arrive.

The players left 
when police arrived.

Prior said: 'We just did what anybody would do in that situation.

Stuart Broad wrote on Twitter: '@MattPrior13 is a best friend of mine and I'm very proud of him. It was a tough situation but so glad he was there'

'We were trying to help a bloke who was struggling and in a bad way. I look back and I’m just glad we left the bar when we did and we were there for him.'

Minish added: 'Walking back to the hotel we spotted a young man on the edge of the bridge about to jump.

'He was saying he just wanted to drown. Matt helped to pull him down off the edge of the bridge and sat with him until the police arrived.

'It all happened very quickly and we acted on impulse. It is what you do in these situations.'

Broad later wrote on Twitter: '@MattPrior13 is a best friend of mine and I'm very proud of him. It was a tough situation but so glad he was there.'

The incident occurred after Prior and Broad had helped raise £8,000 for the Broad Appeal, in aid of Motor Neurone Disease, along with team-mates Ben Stokes, Joe Root and Gary Ballance.

Prior has now returned to England but Broad is still Down Under in preparation for three Twenty20 matches against Australia.

New South Wales police declined to comment.
