This is the astonishing scene that greeted sailors on a New Zealand naval ship - a dog standing helplessly on a drifting log.

It was spotted by the crew of the New Zealand Navy ship Hawea in Smokehouse Bay, east of Auckland, after a fierce storm on Tuesday.

The black and white dog was spotted by Able Seaman Combat Specialist Filipe Latu who immediately consulted his commanding officer.

'Permission to rescue dog floating on a log, Sir,' he said - or a plea similar to that.

Lieutenant Anthony Norris did not need to be asked twice and set in operation a rescue mission.

'Seeing that dog floating on a log was certainly an unusual and unexpected sight,' he told New Zealand media.

'There was significant debris in the water and on one large log floating by was this poor helpless dog.

'I would hate to think how long he was there.'

Operation dog rescue was activated with speed and naval efficiency.

One of the vessel's rigid-hulled inflatable boats, with four sailors on board, was launched and the dog was more than happy to clamber aboard.

Bringing the animal to shore, the sailors were quickly notified that there was someone at hand who knew its owner.

The last report to come from the sailors on board the Hawea was that the dog on a log and its owner had been happily reunited.

The crew handed the dog over to locals who knew the owner before getting back to work by removing debris from the water
