Northern Ireland defender Jonny Evans has hailed the team's efforts in his absence following Tuesday's 2-0 away victory over Greece.

Michael O'Neill's side have now won all of their opening three Euro 2016 qualifiers - the country's best ever start to any World Cup or European qualifying series.

Evans has missed the entire campaign so far, having at first been suspended and then sat out the last two fixtures due to an ankle injury.

Injured Northern Ireland defender Jonny Evans says he is 'immensely proud' of his side's Euro qualifying efforts

Evans hasn't taken the pitch since limping off during United's 5-3 loss to Leicester on September 21

The Manchester United man admits it has been 'absolutely gutting' for him to not be involved, but what he has seen from the sidelines has made him hugely proud.

'Obviously, it (the Greece result) was a great win for the team and I think it was thoroughly deserved,' Evans told manutd.com.

'We had a really good game-plan against Greece and it's fantastic we've got three wins on the trot at the start of the campaign. It sets us up going forward for the rest of the games.

'We've had spells in the past where we've had a lot of wins but the pleasing thing is two of the victories have come away from home, where it's always been difficult for us.

'We had some good performances throughout the last campaign but just came up short with the results.

'I think the manager has done a fantastic job in getting everybody together and believing in ourselves.'

The 26-year-old, whose younger brother Corry Evans started Tuesday's contest, added: 'It's been absolutely gutting to miss the games but I'm immensely proud of the lads for the way they've performed.

'I've been in regular contact with my brother obviously and I'm pleased to see the lads performing so well and getting the result.'

Evans hopes to get his participation in the qualifying campaign under way in Northern Ireland's next fixture, November's trip to Romania - although he may have a job on his hands breaking up a centre-back pairing of Gareth McAuley and Aaron Hughes that have performed admirably so far.

O'Neill's men are top of Group F having seen off Hungary away and the Faroe Islands at home prior to Tuesday's triumph.
