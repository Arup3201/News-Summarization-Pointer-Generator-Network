Gwyneth Paltrow and Victoria Beckham swear by them: apparently, an Epsom salts bath before a night out is a great way to ease bloating.

And they’ve also been shown to improve blood circulation, reduce blood clots and lower blood pressure.

Clearly, there’s more to these fizzy little tablets of magnesium sulfate — traditionally used to aid digestion — than we thought. Here, we reveal some other uses. 

ADD BOUNCE TO YOUR HAIR 

Add Epsom salts to your regular conditioner and heat over warm water and then rub into your hair and leave for 15 minutes (picture posed by model) 

If you want more volume in your hair, mix equal amounts of Epsom salts with your regular conditioner in a bowl and place over a saucepan of water to warm.

Stir with a wooden spoon until the salt dissolves, rub into your hair and leave on for 15 minutes, then wash out. The alkaline salts will break down grease and product build-up, leaving you with extra bounce and shine.

TOP UP YOUR TAN

Rub Epsom salts all over your body before applying self-tan cream to exfoliate your skin (picture posed by model) 

This is ideal if you are about to apply self-tan cream. When you step out of the shower or bath, take a few handfuls of Epsom salts and rub all over your body with a plastic loofah.

The granules are bigger than those in sugar or table salt and perfect for exfoliation. Make sure you scrub behind your knees, ankles and elbows. Wash off with warm water before applying your tanning lotion — it should be flawless.

FIRST AID HELP

Mixing Epsom salts with warm water and soaking a splinter in the solution can help draw the splinter towards the surface of the skin, making it easier to remove

If you have a splinter in your finger, mix two teaspoons of Epsom salts into a warm cup of water until it dissolves and place your hand in the water for five minutes.

The minerals in the salt will draw the splinter to the surface of the skin, making it possible to pull out painlessly with tweezers.

BANISH BRUISES

Need to get rid of an unsightly and painful bruise? Add two cups of Epsom salts to warm water in your bath and soak in it for at least 15 minutes (picture posed by model)

Add two cups of Epsom salts to running warm water in your bath and swish it around until it has dissolved fully.

Stay in the bath for at least 15 minutes to allow the magnesium in the salt to soak into your pores.

This will help relax your muscles, banishing any aches and pains and reducing any bruising or swelling.

TREAT SPOTS

Mix Epsom salts with your regular facial cleanser to help draw out impurities like blackheads and spots (picture posed by model) 

Mix a good slug of Epsom salts with your regular cleanser in a small bowl until it looks like a paste.

Smooth the mixture over your face, rubbing in a little more deeply than you normally would.

The minerals in the salts will help draw out impurities such as blackheads or spots, while the exfoliation will buff up your skin beautifully.

Remove with cotton wool or water before applying your usual moisturiser.

For deeper spots, add a few drops of water to a good dose of salts and dab directly on to any blemishes. Leave on overnight and rinse off in the morning.

CURE HEADACHES

Mix Epsom salts with a glass of warm water and drink to ease headaches and migraines (picture posed by model) 

Headaches and migraines can be caused by a lack of magnesium in your system.

At the first sign of a headache, take a big pinch of Epsom salts in the palm of one hand and have a glass of warm water in the other hand. Toss the salts into the glass of water and mix thoroughly.

Drink as quickly as possible (it doesn’t taste great) and close your eyes for a few minutes to give the salts time to work.

SLEEP BETTER

Take long, warm bath with three cups of Epsom salts dissolved in the water for a good night's sleep (picture posed by model) 

If you’ve been struggling to get a good night’s sleep, pour three cups of Epsom salts into a warm bath and soak for as long as you can.

The magnesium will help reduce stress and anxiety and act as a sedative.

Repeat every night until you settle yourself into a new sleeping pattern.
