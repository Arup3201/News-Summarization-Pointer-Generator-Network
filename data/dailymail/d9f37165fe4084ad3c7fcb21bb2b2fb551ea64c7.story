Lawsuit: Julie Zelent is suing former boyfriend Alan Savage for £500,00 after he dumped her three years ago

A jilted lover suing her millionaire
ex-lover for £500,000 revealed yesterday how she has been forced to sell
jewellery worth tens of thousands of pounds to fund her legal challenge.

Julie Anne Zelent, 51, is pursuing tycoon
Alan Savage after claiming she was left 'economically disadvantaged' when he
asked her to leave.

The businesswoman moved to the Highlands
to be with the former football club chairman but he ended the relationship
three years ago.

Now Miss Zelent is seeking compensation,
including £1,300 for a dress worn only once, following the break-up of the
relationship with the 61-year-old millionaire.

Yesterday, she told Inverness
Sheriff Court how she sold jewellery worth £25,000, given to her by Mr Savage,
to help to cover her costs.

She also revealed that she is now in
receipt of legal aid after running into financial difficulties.

Miss Zelent said: 'I actually sold the
jewellery when I ran out of costs for this case and legal fees. I sold it all.'

She added that she had been funding her
case with her own funds and with the aid of her family.

The latest revelations come as the court
also heard how Miss Zelent spent thousands of pounds on designer dresses which
Mr  Savage insisted she wear only once.

She is now seeking the cash back from the
businessman, claiming she will never wear the outfits again and intends giving
them to charity.

The £6,992 spent on clothing is part of almost £70,000 which
she says she splashed out from her own bank accounts during her relationship
with the former Inverness Caley Thistle chairman, who she claims promised her
marriage.

Miss Zelent wants cash for loss of
earnings, work benefits and pension rights as she gave up a high-powered career
with the Royal Bank of Scotland in London to be with Mr Savage in the
Highlands.

Mr Savage and Miss Zelent had lived together at his home in the Scottish Highlands, with her leaving a high-powered IT job to move in with him

She gave details of her extravagant
lifestyle with him and told how he never wanted her to wear the same dress
twice at business functions.

On one occasion, she spent £1,303 on one dress
at  Morgans boutique in Beauly.

She said: 'He wanted me to look unique. He
didn't want me wearing the same outfit as anyone else. I would only wear them
at one  function.

'They would just sit at home in the wardrobe. I still
have them boxed up. I didn't want to get rid of them until the end of this
case. I will probably donate them to charity.'

Other expenses she listed as being spent
from her own accounts included £4,200 on health and beauty treatments, £2,012
on health and fitness club membership, £410 on drink at Perth Races, £21,782 on
household goods and fuel, and £7,869 on travel costs.

The former computer facilities manager for
RBS is also claiming for £271 spent on TV licences and £288 on council tax
payments.

Seeking compensation: Miss Zelent said they had talked of marriage in 2008 but Mr Savage suddenly asked her to leave after a golfing weekend with his son Paul who had resented the relationship starting shortly after his mother Linda's death from cancer

Regarding the clothing and beauty
treatments, she said: 'These were purchases made only when I was with Alan. I
would never dream of having my hair done if I wasn't going to functions with
Alan. I would not have made this expenditure.

'I don't attend any functions now. I have
no use for the clothing. Had I not been with Alan, I  certainly would not
have bought any of these items.'

The court has heard she was paid an
allowance of £4,000 a month rather than work at Mr Savage's Orion business.

She said they had talked of  marriage
in 2008 but Mr Savage suddenly asked her to leave after a golfing weekend with
his son Paul who had resented the relationship starting shortly after his
mother Linda's death from cancer.

Miss Zelent had quit a £54,000-a-year IT
job with RBS to live with the millionaire.

She is now in a civil partnership
with a former U.S. Marine in North Carolina but has so far not found a new job.

Last
year, Mr Savage married Lynne Cordiner, an ex-corporate fundraiser for Highland
Hospice. The civil hearing continues.
