Some restaurant atmospheres are plain dead - but one Indian restaurant owner claims business has flourished since opening his eaterie at the site of an old cemetery.

Rather than ripping out the graves to make way for his restaurant, owner Krishnan Kutti even chose to preserve the coffins and place tables around them at the ironically-named New Lucky Restaurant in Ahmadabad.

The coffins are the remnants of a Muslim cemetery and the cafe has now become a popular hang-out for both young and old.

Flourishing: Krishnan Kutti, owner of New Lucky Restaurant in Ahmadabad, India, claims business is brisk since opening his cafe at the site of an old cemetery

Unique: The New Lucky Restaurant promises a different experience for its customers

Kutti said: 'The graveyard brings good luck. Our business has been flourishing because of these graves. It gives people a unique experience.

'We have maintained the graves as they were. Our customers don't seem to mind.'

However, the owner has little idea who the graves belong to, while some locals claim they contain the remains of followers of a 16th-Century Sufi saint, whose tomb lies nearby.

Around a dozen graves lay inside the restaurant and have been sealed off by iron grills.

Every morning, when the shutters of the restaurant are pulled up, waiters spend some time wiping the gravestones and decorating them with fresh flowers.

'We begin our day by paying respects to the graves.

'We wipe them and cover them with cloth and also shower flowers on them.

'It is important to respect the dead,' said Kutti.

Preserved: Owner Krishnan Kutti decided to place tables around the graves rather than disturb them

Mind your step: Customers have to negotiate their way around the coffins to the tables

Respectful: The graves do not seem to bother the clientÃ¨le, while staff begin their day by paying their respects
