Scandal: Craig Thomson is accused of using a union credit card when he was a union official to pay for prositutes

An Australian MP has been accused of using an official credit card to pay for prostitutes, sparking a political scandal that could bring down the government.

New South Wales state police said they are looking into new evidence that Craig Thomson misused a trade union credit card when he was a senior union official in 2005 and 2007.

A conviction for theft or fraud would force Mr Thomson to quit parliament and cost Prime Minister Julia Gillard's year-old government its single-seat majority.

With opinion polls showing the government has become deeply unpopular, observers agree that the ruling Labor Party would have little hope of retaining Mr Thomson's seat in an ensuing by-election.

Mr Thomson has denied any wrongdoing and Ms Gillard has publicly supported the MP, who was first elected when Labor swept to power in 2007.

The allegation, first raised by a Sydney newspaper in 2009, dates back to when Mr Thomson was national secretary of the Health Services Union.

He allegedly used his union credit card to pay a Sydney brothel thousands of dollars of union money in two transactions.

Mr Thomson has denied the allegation and claimed that an unnamed man had taken his credit card and forged his signature. He also said that that man had repaid the money.

Mr Thomson sued the newspaper's owner, Fairfax Media Publications, but dropped that court action in May.

Police have never investigated the allegations because the Health Services Union, which is aligned with Labor, has never made a complaint.

But an opposition senator, George Brandis, wrote to Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione yesterday with new evidence he said showed Mr Thomson had committed a range of crimes, including fraud, which is punishable by 10 years in prison.

The new evidence included a statement from a forensic handwriting expert who said Mr Thomson had probably signed one of the brothel credit card dockets in question.

It also included a bundle of recently released court documents that Fairfax would have used in the defamation trial as proof of many more instances in which Thomson allegedly paid prostitutes with the same credit card.

When asked in parliament to comment on the growing scandal, Ms Gillard said: 'It would be inappropriate for me to comment further.'

She denied any involvement in a decision by a Labor state branch to pay toward Mr Thomson's legal bills for settling his defamation case, adding: 'Decisions about finances related to the New South Wales Labor Party are for the New South Wales Labor Party to make.'

The party will not explain the generous gift, but the opposition is convinced it was to prevent Mr Thomson being bankrupted by his legal bills.

Under Australia's constitution, an MP must quit Parliament if he or she is bankrupt or convicted of a crime that carries a potential prison sentence of at least 12 months.
