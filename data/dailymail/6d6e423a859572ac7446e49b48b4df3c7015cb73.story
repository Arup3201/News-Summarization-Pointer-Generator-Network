A NYU student has miraculously survived falling ten stories and being trapped between two New York buildings for over 24 hours.

Asher Vongtau, 19, is in a serious condition in hospital after emergency workers freed him from a tight space between a parking garage and the NYU dorm building at 80 Lafayette St, Chinatown, in lower Manhattan.

It is not known how he came to fall, however fire officials said the only way into the crawl space was from above.

Rescuers believe the narrow walls of the air shaft where Vongtau fell broke the fall.

Vongtau, originally from Pittsburgh, was wedged in a space that was just a foot and a half wide.

Amazingly, he was conscious and talking when paramedics got to him, according to New York Daily News.

Investigators will now look into reports as to whether a false fire alarm was linked to the fall, with the student last seen 'frantically running to the roof' during an evacuation.

A public safety officer discovered Vongtau after he was reported missing by other students.

CBS New York said a campus officer found his cellphone on the building's roof.

He was last seen frantically running up a stairwell after a false fire alarm had been triggered.

'I saw him frantically running up the stairs while people were exiting 
the building because the fire alarm had been pulled,' said fellow student Colin Chenel.

There were other reports that people heard screaming coming from the lower levels of the dorm.

It took rescue workers 1 1/2 hours to remove him.

They had to break through a nearby wall.

A breathing apparatus was lowered down to Vongtau while the rescue effort got underway.

Vongtau is now seeking treatment at Bellevue Hospital.

The extent of his injuries have not yet been released

An investigation will be opened to determine how he fell.

Students reported that a fire alarm went off on Saturday morning, speculating Vongtau may have gone to the roof to escape.
