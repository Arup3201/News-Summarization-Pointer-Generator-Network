Poisoned spy Alexander Litvinenko was a top analyst for MI6, causing the KGB to have him murdered for 'treason'. 

That's according to one of the Russian dissident's closest confidantes Yuri Felshtinsky, a historian who co-authored the book Blowing Up Russia with the former secret agent.

He has claimed his former collaborator should have been protected by British intelligence from the KGB assassins who allegedly poisoned him with radioactive plutonium-210 at a central London hotel in November 2006.

In an interview with police while he lay on his deathbed, Mr Litvinenko said that Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun 'wanted to kill me'.

Mr Felshtinsky has submitted testimony to the ongoing public inquiry into Mr Litvinenko's fatal poisoning.

The book the pair wrote accused the FSB, the contemporary name for the KGB, of blowing up Moscow apartment blocks to justify a war against Chechnya.

A final photograph of Mr Litvinenko, taken as the former KGB spy was dying in hospital shortly before he lost consciousness for the last time, was shown to the inquiry this week.

The 43-year-old agreed to have pictures taken during his final days so that the world could see how 'he was poisoned by the Kremlin'.

His friend Alex Goldfarb told the hearing that the image, which shows him gaunt and obviously gravely ill, was the last ever taken before he died from radiation poisoning at University College Hospital.

The inquiry was also told Mr Litvinenko had a 'feeling' that two Russian men were planning to murder him during the meeting in which he drank tea laced with plutonium.

He met the two men, Lugovoi and Kovtun, at the Millennium Hotel in central London on November 1, 2006, and drank a few sips of tea which later turned out to be poisoned, the hearing was told.

The Russian dissident, who fled to the UK in 2000 and claimed asylum before becoming a British citizen, rapidly fell ill and began foaming at the mouth, while vomiting up bloody portions of his stomach lining.

It is understood he met a man known as 'Martin', his MI6 handler, at Waterstones Piccadilly branch on October 31 - the day before the suspected poisoning.

Giving evidence at the inquiry, Mr Litvinenko's widow Marina wept as she told the court her husband's last words were, 'I love you so much.'

Mrs Litvinenko kept a daily bedside vigil as her husband deteriorated from a 'healthy and good looking man' to a dying patient whose vital organs were failing fast.

During one visit she stroked his head only for clumps of hair to fall out in her hand and onto the pillow. 

The inquiry has previously been told that the spy was one of Vladimir Putin's fiercest critics, and had allegedly been told that the Russian government was planning to murder him.

The hearing continues.
