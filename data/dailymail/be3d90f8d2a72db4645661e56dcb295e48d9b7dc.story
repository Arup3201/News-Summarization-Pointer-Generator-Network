A woman fugitive arrested 37 years after escaping a women's prison in Michigan, was finally caught thanks to a combination of bad weather and her memorable eyes.

Judy Lynn Hayman was arrested on Monday, after San Diego police received a mug shot from a Michigan officer who was going through old fingerprint cards of escapees while weathering a winter storm.

Authorities had been searching for Hayman since she escaped from Ypsilanti prison in 1977, where she was serving an 18 month to two year sentence for attempting to steal clothes from a store near Detroit.

San Diego police say Hayman identified herself as Jamie Lewis and produced government documents bearing that name.

Officers, however, remained suspicious because of inconsistencies in her story and her resemblance to an old Michigan mug shot, taken in 1976, that they were holding.

'Her eyes gave her away,' San Diego police lieutenant Kevin Mayer said. 'The eyes in the picture matched the eyes of this woman.'

She acknowledged being Hayman after police took her in for further questioning, Lieutenant Mayer said.

It wasn't immediately clear how long Hayman had been in San Diego. But neighbors at her well-kept, nondescript apartment complex blocks from Balboa Park said she lived in the building for almost seven years.

Her 32-year-old son was visiting when police arrived, and officers said he appeared stunned by their questions.

'This seemed very much a surprise to him,' Lieutenant Mayer said.

Her son, named only as Aaron, said he was worried for his mother but didn't tell NBC7 if Hayman's children knew about her double life.

Aaron said his mother had ties to the San Diego community, where she attended church and PTA meetings.

Neighbors had said the woman they knew as Jamie Lewis kept to herself, not speaking of her past.

Hayman is being held in a San Diego County jail awaiting extradition to Michigan and is scheduled to appear in court Thursday.

Michigan authorities want her returned to the state to complete her sentence for attempted larceny. She also could face a separate criminal charge for the escape.

Lieutenant Charles Levens, of the Michigan Corrections Department, helped catch Hayman after sending fingerprint cards to the FBI.

He explained that many police agencies had fingerprints that matched Hayman's but under different names. He gave the information to an investigator, Tim Hardville, who tracked her down in San Diego.

'I said, "Tim, you're going to get your girl here",' Lieutenant Levens said. 'There are two ways to get off our list: a death certificate or a [live] body. It's what the state pays us to do. ... If you're a fugitive, you have an obligation to pay your debt to society.'

Hayman, using aliases, apparently had
 been arrested and fingerprinted in the past and the San Diego police 
'were familiar with her,' Michigan Corrections Department spokesman Russ
 Marlan said.

Lieutenant 
Mayer declined to give further details about the case, including whether
 Hayman had prior arrests or contact with police in California.

Theresa
 Padilla said she lived next to Hayman for more than six years and 
described her as a 'quiet loner, but basically a nice person'.

Ms Padilla said Hayman spent most of her time indoors, except when she walked her chihuahua, Monty, who was old and had to be put down less than a year ago.

Hayman had photos of three sons on her wall, and at least one of them visited often, taking out her trash and doing other chores, Ms Padilla said, adding: 'Her three boys seemed like they were raised well.'

Ms Padilla said Hayman didn't appear to be married or have a job. She said she and Hayman spoke infrequently but did share their experiences in battling cancer. Hayman also mentioned living in Detroit and being a fan of Michigan basketball teams.

Ms Padilla was shocked to learn of her neighbor's past on Monday.

'It don't make sense, going after this lady for a petty little thing,' she said. 'They need to go after the molesters, the killers, those who hurt little babies, not someone who stole something when she was 23.'

Corrections spokesman Mr Marlan said all fugitives must be pursued.

'We can't just write it off,' he said. 'We don't have the ability to say, "It's been a long time. You're free to go".'

San Diego district attorney's office spokesman Steve Walker said Hayman is scheduled for her first hearing Thursday morning.

If she doesn't fight her extradition, she will be sent immediately to Michigan. If she does contest it, another hearing will be held the following day.

It will be up to the state parole board to determine how long Hayman will be imprisoned.
