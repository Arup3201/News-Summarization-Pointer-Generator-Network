A model has gone from cleaner to the catwalk after an international agency took a shine to her  looks.

Aleksandra Naranowicz, 27, struggled to find work after moving to England from Poland despite an impressive CV and a masters degree.

She made ends meet with a modest £250-a-week job as a cleaner - but her luck changed when one of her clients referred her to a London modelling agent.

Now THAT's a change of profession! Aleksandra Naranowicz has gone from cleaning floors to taking to the catwalk after an international agency signed her up on the recommendation

They told Aleksandra she had the figure and looks of a model and the six-foot 
cleaner soon left her mop and marigolds behind.

She has already starred in a string of adverts and catwalk shows and is earning up to £2,000 a shoot.

Aleksandra said: 'People said I had a pretty face and that I’d be good as a model. This gave me the confidence to meet modelling agencies in London.

'Clients seem to like my face and my hair. Every time I go to a job my hair gets shorter and blonder. But I really enjoy the work and am hoping it will lead to more.'

Getting lucky: One of her clients referred her to a London modelling agent. They told her that she had the figure and looks of a model and so she left her job to work as a model full-time

Aleksandra left Poland with a Masters degree in Pedagogy - the science and art of education - and moved to Stokes Croft, Bristol.

She took a job with local cleaning firm Mopp and one of her clients, a retired media mogul, told her ‘with bone structure like that you should be on a catwalk not cleaning my kitchen floor’.

She spent the next few months working as a cleaner to save the money to go to castings in London and was signed up by PRM, a leading model management company.

She now works as a full-time model and has done countless shoots, specialising in hair magazines and adverts.

Mopp founder Pete Dowds said: 'We’re delighted to have been a part of helping Aleksandra with her career.

'She was a
 brilliant addition to Mopp’s Bristol cleaning team so we’re sorry to 
lose her but no doubt she’ll "clean up" in the fashion world in no 
time.'

Paulo Ribeiro, director of PRM added: 'She has got a striking look and nice short blonde hair which makes her really stand out.'

Change of day job! Aleksandra left Poland with a Masters degree in Pedagogy - the science and art of education - and moved to Bristol to become a cleaner

Finding her niche: She now works as a full-time model and has done countless shoots, specialising in hair magazines and adverts
