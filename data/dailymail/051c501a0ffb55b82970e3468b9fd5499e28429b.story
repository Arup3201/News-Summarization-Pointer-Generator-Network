Worrying: Lung cancer deaths in British women outnumber those from breast cancer and will continue rising for the rest of the decade, warn researchers. Smoking has been blamed for the predicted increase

Lung cancer deaths in British women outnumber those from breast cancer and will continue rising for the rest of the decade, warn researchers.

At a time when death rates from other cancers are falling, an international survey shows lung cancer is the biggest killer in the UK, which has the highest rate in Europe.

Figures published today predict a rising number of cancer deaths across 27 countries in Europe, reaching 1.3million in 2013, although the rate of deaths per head of population is actually declining.

A group of researchers from Italy and Switzerland estimate that, compared with 2009, the overall level of cancer deaths has fallen 6 per cent among men and 4 per cent in women.

Experts say advances in treatment and management are responsible for falling death rates in almost every form of the disease, except for lung cancer in women.

It will continue rising because women took up smoking later in the 20th century than men, which means cancer develops later.

In the UK, lung cancer is the biggest cause of cancer death in women claiming almost 16,000 lives a year compared with 12,000 from breast cancer, and the rest of Europe is catching up.

Lung cancer deaths have risen by 7 per cent among women in Europe since 2009, says the study published in the cancer journal Annals of Oncology.

One of the study’s authors, Professor Carlo La Vecchia, head of the Department of Epidemiology at the Mario Negri Institute and professor at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Milan, said: ‘If these opposite trends in breast and lung cancer rates continue, then in 2015 lung cancer is going to become the first cause of cancer mortality in Europe.

‘This is already true in the UK and Poland, the two countries with the highest rates: 21.2 and 17.5 per 100,000 women respectively.

'This predicted rise of female lung cancer in the UK may reflect the increased prevalence of young women starting smoking in the late 1960s and 1970s, possibly due to changing socio-cultural attitudes at that time.

‘However, fewer young women nowadays in the UK and elsewhere in Europe are smoking and, therefore, deaths from lung cancer may start to level off after 2020 at around 15 per 100,000 women.’

Deaths from breast cancer have been declining steadily, with a 7 per cent fall in rates since 2009 in the EU.

Although lung cancer is still the main cause of cancer death among men, with 187,000 deaths predicted for 2013, giving a death rate of 37.2 per 100,000 men, this represents a  6 per cent fall since 2009.

Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: ‘The prediction that lung cancer will overtake breast cancer as the main cause of death among European women is a real concern.

‘If we are to avoid such statistics remaining with us well into the 21st century, we will need to continue pushing for tobacco control measures such as standardised packaging for cigarettes and a ban on point of sale.’

Sally Greenbrook, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘It’s encouraging that breast cancer mortality rates in the UK and across Europe are falling.

‘However, we must not become complacent as there is still more vital work to be done.

‘We need to dedicate more research into the prevention and treatment of these diseases to save more lives in the future.’
