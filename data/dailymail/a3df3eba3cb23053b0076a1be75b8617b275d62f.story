An enchanting church, a beach at sunset, or perhaps a Scottish castle.

Women spend their entire lives fantasising about their wedding day.

But few will have had Battersea Power Station's derelict chimneys in mind.

The iconic site, which has lain unused for three decades, is set to become the sought-after backdrop for brides and grooms with money to burn in London, developers claim.

Idyllic wedding setting? World-class architects Frank Gehry and Lord Foster have been chosen to transform Battersea Power Station and the 39-acre site surrounding it in a development plan to finish in 10 years

In a billion-pound project masterminded by two of the world's top architects, the 1.8million sq ft building will be transformed into a deluxe party-hosting complex, complete with apartments and high streets to keep guests occupied.

For couples that have always dreamed of hosting 1,000 guests in the setting that graced Pink Floyd's album cover, their wish could be realised for upwards of £250,000.

Sarah Haywood, a bespoke wedding planner, told The Times: 'There are a lot of people in London who have homes here but are not from this country and who like to have very large parties.

Magnificent: A bespoke wedding planner said the plan, being unveiled next week, fills a gap in the market

'[People
from] the Middle East own most of London and when they have parties 
they have big ones. They really struggle to find large enough venues.'

The proposal, which will be unveiled by Battersea Power Station Development Company, is part of a long-term project to rejuvenate the site by its new Malaysian owners.

Rob Tincknell, chief executive of Battersea Power Station Development Company, said the development will be 'completely different from anything that currently exists' in London.

This week, Frank Gehry, famous for the Guggenheim in Bilbao, and Lord Foster of Thames Bank, who designed The Gherkin, were selected to transform the 39-acre site - with a view to finish in ten years' time.

Long-term: The current project is 'phase three'. Phase One, the building of flats, has already finished

Investment: The site's Malaysian owners vow to put at least £1billion into the regeneration of the venue

They are working under the direction of Rafael Vinoly, whose controversial 'Walkie Talkie' skyscraper in 
London's financial district made headlines after melting parts of a 
Jaguar car parked below with reflected sunlight.

'Our goal is to help create a neighbourhood and a place for people to live that respects the iconic Battersea Power Station while connecting it into the broader fabric of the city,' Gehry said in a statement on Wednesday.

His trademark curved surfaces are dotted all over America, but his only British project stands in Dundee.

He was commissioned to mastermind the so-called Phase 3 of Battersea Power Station's makeover by the Malaysian consortium that bought the area last year.

Vows: Couples will be able to say their vows on the Thames with 1,000 guests for upwards of £250,000

The owners want the Station, which ceased generating power fifty years ago, to be as famous at the Tate

The first phase of flats has been sold and construction has started. 
Work has also begun on replacing the white chimneys with exact replicas.

It will feature two residential zones astride a high street with 1,200 homes, a hotel overlooking the power station, shops and restaurants.

A design competition will be held to find a partner to help to create a world-class river pier and Jetty.

River-bus services will begin next March.

The power station's new owners, SP Setia, Sime Darby and the Employees Provident Fund pension fund, want to sell 3,400 homes to help the development hit a value of 8 billion pounds in 15 years' time.
