Nine Japanese porn stars will have their breasts broadcast live on television - while inviting random fans across Tokyo to participate in the 'hands on' experience.

Loosely transcribed as 'Boob Aid', the well-known adult movie stars will bare their breasts for charity while the public line-up over a 24 hour period on Saturday.

The adult actresses told local media on Monday they could barely contain their excitement about the 'Stop! AIDS' campaign event — which will be televised live — but asked, perhaps somewhat optimistically for the fans to be 'delicate'.

Across 24 hours fans will line up to meet their favourite porn stars...

The event will raise money for the Stop! AIDS campaign which raises money and awareness about the virus

'I'm really looking forward to lots of people fondling my boobs,' actress Rina Serina told the Tokyo Sports newspaper.'

'But I would be very happy if you would please be delicate.'

The event will be broadcast on adult cable television and the willing participants  will donate to the anti-AIDS campaign in exchange for a feel.

Earlier this year sexist heckling of a Tokyo politician hit the headlines in Japan, highlighting old-fashioned views towards women that still permeate Japanese society.

Actress 'Serina' who will be taking part said she never thought her breasts would be used for the greater good.

'I never thought my boobs could contribute to society,' she said. 

Fellow porn actress Iku Sakuragi had no qualms about being groped by hundreds of pairs of hands. 

'It's for charity,' the 21-year-old said. 'Squeeze them, donate money — let's be happy.'

Lawmakers from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling party sparked a public outcry in June when they subjected a Tokyo politician Ayaka Shiomura to sexist taunts, shouting 'why don't you get married?' at her during a debate on motherhood.

Japan has one of the lowest rates of female workforce participation in the developed world and a lack of childcare facilities.

Poor career support and deeply entrenched sexism are blamed for keeping women at home.

The 24-hour event begins at 8pm on Saturday  and is backed by the Japan Foundation for AIDS Prevention.
