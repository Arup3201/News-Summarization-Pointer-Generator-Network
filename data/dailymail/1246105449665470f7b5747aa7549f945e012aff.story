A man is on an international quest to track down a couple after he stumbled across a long lost memory card with 1600 romantic happy snaps from their Australian honeymoon.  

Richard Pussell, who manages Sydney Aquarium, was carrying out a routine check of lost property on Tuesday when he found the camera card.

The photos were taken in 2012 and document the mystery couple's entire trip around Australia from Kakadu and Ayres Rock to Melbourne and Sydney.

Mrs Benetti said she was initially mad at her husband for losing the pictures

'We were doing an inventory of lost property and as usual there are lots of cameras. I found a box full so I took everything out and underneath there was a lonely SD card,' Mr Pussell told MailOnline.

'It had been there for a while so I took it home with the intent of reformatting it so I could use it in my camera.'

Mr Pussell said he was shocked to find hundreds of romantic photos of a couple in front of Australia's most famous landmarks.

'The first photo is of her showing off her wedding ring. The last photo is in (Sydney's) Darling Harbour. They're classic honeymoon photos and they've been everywhere,' he said.

'I couldn't bring myself to delete them.'

The photos Mr Pussell found document Mr and Mrs Benetti's entire trip around Australia, like this shot from Kata Tjuta in the Northern Territory

Mrs Benetti was completely surprised and overwhelmed that she was reunited with the photos

The only information Mr Pussell has to go off is a photo of a welcome card in a hotel congratulating the 'Benetti's' on their recent marriage.

He also suspects the couple are from Italy because a number of photos capture signs and plaques written in Italian.

Mr Pussell posted a photo of the pair on Facebook on Tuesday to try and track them down in a bid to return the photos.

His post on the mystery couple had been shared 100,000 times by Thursday morning.

'It would be a real shame if I couldn't find them,' he said.

'My wife and I got married two years ago and I thought imagine if we lost our photos.'

This card from a hotel in the Northern Territory was the only information Mr Pussell had to go off to track them down
