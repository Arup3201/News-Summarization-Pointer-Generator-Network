Roy Hodgson's fears about the Wembley surface appear set to be realised after the Slovenian team trained inside the stadium on Friday night and claimed the centre of the pitch was 'completely ruined'.

Hodgson has been concerned about wear and tear on the pitch after a series of three American Football games in recent weeks, culminating when the Dallas Cowboys and the Jacksonville Jaguars clashed on Sunday.

Evidence of the NFL game remains and remnants of the yardage marks and team logos which were emblazoned across the pitch will be plain to see for those inside a sold-out Wembley and the armchair audience at home.

More worrying for Hodgson and his England team will be the state of the turf. It appears perfectly clear on the wings, because the American Football play on a narrower pitch, but a strip down the centre looked heavy and was cutting up last night after a day of steady rain as the Slovenians trained.

The area in the centre-circle was the worst of all. It is not a return to the bad-old days when the pitch inside the new stadium was a complete embarrassment, but one of the Slovenian backroom team said: 'The centre of the pitch is completely ruined. There is a 10 metre square of grass where there is no grass at all.'

Hodgson aired his thoughts last weekend, claiming the pitch was 'not in the best of nick' and met with stadium officials to clear the air, as Wembley confirmed more NFL fixtures for next autumn.

Slovenia boss Srecko Katanec said: 'If there is rain or it is muddy it is, up to a point, an advantage for the team that is defending because the ball is harder to control. But I don't care.

'The pitch will be in the same condition for both teams. We must play here and we can't change. It is the same for all the players if the pitch is bad or super or synthetic.'
