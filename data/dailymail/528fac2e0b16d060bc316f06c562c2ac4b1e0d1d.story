A door-to-door salesman who promised to clean an elderly grandmother's home before charging her $3500 for a vacuum cleaner she cannot even lift.

Paulette Rozan, who lives in a one bedroom apartment in Southport, north of Surfers Paradise in Queensland and cannot lift heavy objects after having shoulder surgery, said the salesman convinced her to sign up for a cleaning service.

The 83-year-old woman told A Current Affair she was convinced to sign up after the man said he 'was from the government' who worked as a cleaner.

The 83-year-old woman told A Current Affair that the salesman claimed he was a cleaner from the government and asked if he could clean her carpet

The Gold Coast woman said he asked if he could come and clean her carpet

'Can I come to clean your place? I said 'yes,' she said.

When she realised the salesman was trying to sell her a Kirby vacuum cleaner, she said, 'no thank you.'

'I was very angry to have that vacuum cleaner. I've never used it and nobody used it, ' Ms Rozan said.

'I said I can't use it, don't you understand? [The man said] But you don't have to use it because I will come and use it for you.

'He said, "don't worry, I'll come every week to do the cleaning". I believed him because I told him I cannot use that vacuum cleaner - it's too heavy and I've got a vacuum cleaner.'

An elderly grandmother was promised to have her house cleaned every week by a door-to-door salesman, instead, she was left with a $3500 vacuum cleaner almost the size of her

Monique Hopkins said there was no possible way for her grandmother to use the vacuum cleaner if she wanted to because it was too heavy and big

A Current Affair visited the Queensland Carpet Shampooers and Vacuums Pty Ltd in Bundall, west of Surfers Paradise and a saleswoman demonstrated on how to use the Kirby vacuum cleaner.

When asked how heavy the machines were, the saleswoman said: 'They're about 18 kilos.'

'It pretty much sells itself. It can blow up air mattresses and balloons and all that, the list goes on and on. And they all explain that when they come out,' the saleswoman said.

Ms Rozan said the man told her: "Don't worry. This is a fantastic vacuum cleaner and it vacuum cleans and steams - everything. I'll do it" but I never see him again and never heard from him.'

Her granddaughter Monique Hopkins said: 'I just thought he took advantage of her, an elderly lady who was not understanding of what was being said,' she said.

Ms Hopkins said her grandmother is around five foot tall and the vacuum cleaner is almost the size of her.

'So she's not even big enough or strong enough to be able to use a machine and you can see that by just looking at it straight away.'

The distributor told A Current Affair that the Kirby vacuum cleaner can shampoo carpets, blow up air mattresses and balloons, and can also do spray tans

Ms Hopkins said that there was no possible way that her grandmother could use it if she wanted to.

But that didn't stop the salesman from selling it to the elderly woman and she didn't realise how much it had cost her until he left her home.

'My credit card - I paid him and he left. And he left me that and took the money.'

Ms Rozan told A Current Affair that she cannot afford to keep the vacuum cleaner but was told that the machine could shampoo so he could come and shampoo her carpets as well.

Tim Perry, from Queensland's Fair Trading, told A Current Affair that it was also the first time he heard of the salesman's offer to do the cleaning for the customer.

'It would be a very flamboyant sales technique to go around and vacuum someone's house on the provider that they purchase the product. It's the first time I've heard one of those.

'That's probably the first $3500 vacuum cleaner I've ever heard of,' Mr Perry said.

A Current Affair reports that the distributor had told them that the vacuum cleaner can even do a spray tan, which is another service that Ms Rozan did not need.

'He did take advantage of me and I won't let him in [my home] again,' she said.

A sales rep from the distrubutor told A Current Affair that the vacuum cleaner weighed around 18 kilograms

Ms Hopkins said she called the distributor to tell them that she was not happy with the situation that had happened to her grandmother.

'Shes been taken advantage of and we would like our money back and there was no more contact after that,' Ms Hopkins said.

Ms Rozan is not the only one who came close to falling for the 'promising deal.' One woman posted on the A Current Affair Facebook page saying she also had a man selling a Kirby vacuum clearer at her door step, 'promising to clean all my carpets.'

'One square for the demo, couldn't get a stain out and some ridiculous price which even though, all through the 3 hours, I asked the price was not revealed until the end,' she posted.

A Current Affair contacted the company on Thursday and were told that the man who sold Ms Rozan the vacuum cleaner, no longer worked for the company and reported that the manager apologised for the stress they put Ms Rozan through and were happy to refund her money.
