A 10-year-old girl accidentally lit a fire that burnt down her family's entire house while playing with fireworks on New Year's Eve.

Rebecca Berrios was using Roman Candles on the front porch of her Conroe home in the early afternoon as her 12-year-old brother and 13-year-old sister played nearby.

According to Montgomery County fire investigators, one of the fireworks ignited others that were sitting on the family's porch ahead of the evening's celebrations.

The fire then spread to a pile of items the family were keeping outside for an upcoming yard sale.

'I lost everything, but not my faith. I got my faith,' father Marcos Berrios told KHOU.com.

Mr Berrios was doing mechanic work in the backyard when the fire started, and a neighbor informed him the front of his house had set alight.

'Within talking to him, it was a small fire,' neighbor Damien Alexander told the station.

Sad: 'I lost everything, but not my faith. I got my faith,' father Marcos Berrios said after the tragedy

'By the time we got the family out and I called 911 the whole porch was engulfed and the house was covered in black smoke.'

It took just minutes for the inferno to spread through the three bedroom home.

Miraculously, the family of five escaped, as did their five Chihuahuas.

However, nearly everything in the residence was destroyed, including Christmas presents that were opened just a week ago.

Miracle: Incredibly, a few belongings survived the fire, including a musical instrument, pictured, and a bible
