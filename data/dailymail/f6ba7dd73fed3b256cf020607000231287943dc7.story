Serial criminals with more than 100 convictions are routinely escaping with a slap on the wrist, it emerged yesterday.

Extraordinary new figures reveal that in the past year alone, 1,079 of the country’s most prolific offenders were spared a jail term by courts.

Soft justice is being handed out to criminals guilty of even some of the worst crimes.

New figures reveal that in the past year alone, 1,079 of the country's most prolific offenders were spared jail

In one shocking case, a burglar being sentenced for his 65th offence was given another chance – despite having a history of crime stretching back 50 years.

In total, 2,583 burglars with 15 or more previous convictions were let off with a fine or other community punishment last year.

Similarly, 1,970 people found guilty more than 15 times of violence against the person also escaped prison.

For all offences – including robbery and sex crimes – some 112,700 people with more than ten convictions avoided a jail sentence in 2013.

Incredibly, this included 8,500 offenders who had already been punished on 50 previous occasions.

The figures caused alarm in Whitehall and risk creating new tensions inside the legal system.

A senior Government source said: ‘We have always been clear that prison is the right place for people who deserve to be there, and if that’s not where they are ending up, we have to make sure we know why not.’ 

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the figures underline why we have set about toughening the justice system

The research provides fresh confirmation of how Britain’s justice system is failing to rehabilitate the criminals responsible for the majority of crime in England and Wales.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘These figures underline why we have set about toughening the justice system, including scrapping repeat cautions and make sure community sentences have a proper element of punishment.

'By the end of this Parliament we will have 3,000 more adult male prison places than we inherited in 2010, even though we have been dealing with severe financial pressures.

'It is also why we have made tackling reoffending a central part of our strategy for the criminal justice system.’

More than half a million crimes each year are committed by those who have broken the law before.

'But despite successive governments repeatedly tinkering with the justice system, reoffending rates have been largely static for a decade.

Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre For Crime Prevention think-tank, said it was ‘extremely dangerous’ to give soft sentences to prolific criminals. ‘Judges could have prevented a huge number of crimes by giving these hardened criminals longer sentences,’ he said.

‘Even after they are released, criminals who go to prison for two years or more reoffend less than those who get community service or a shorter sentence.

‘If judges think there isn’t the capacity to lock up more serious, repeat offenders, the answer is to build more prison places, not more soft justice.’ 

Reoffending is said to cost the country up to £13billion a year.

Ministry of Justice figures show that the highest reoffending rates are for prisoners serving less than 12 months.

At present they receive little or no support on release and 60 per cent quickly break the law again.

From next year, those offenders will be put under mandatory supervision in the community for 12 months after release.

Prisons minister Jeremy Wright admitted that there was a ‘persistent hardcore of offenders being recycled’ round the justice system.

He said the Government was seeking to tackle reoffending by ‘transforming’ rehabilitation.
