A Lego nursery is the stuff children's dreams are made of and these babies are sure to fit right in.

The special tank has built especially for four baby bamboo sharks who have now taken up residence in their new home.

The unique aquarium at Legoland Windsor has been kitted out by model makers with brightly coloured Duplo trains and bridges for the sharks to swim through.

The exotic sharks have been bred at the Atlantis Submarine Voyage but they needed the special nursery as they are still too small to be moved to the main display.

Currently they are only seven inches long but they will grow to over one metre when they reach maturity.

They will then be moved to the Atlantis Submarine Voyage, where visitors can ride through the tank and see scores of sharks up close.

Aquarium curator Iain Grieve said: 'We are delighted to have successfully hatched so many babies this year.

'They are far too small to go into the main display, where guests are submerged in yellow submarines with giant underwater viewing windows.

'So we have created a special nursery for them to grow up in which offers an amazing 360-degree view.'

New home: The sharks were born in November and bred at the Atlantis Submarine Voyage

Visitors can walk into the middle of the nursery display and watch the tiny sharks from a dome in the centre.

The bamboo sharks were born in November and have been raised in a quarantine area.

They join 18 other sharks at Atlantis, including a juvenile zebra shark raised at the resort in 2012, which has now been transferred to the main display.

Wild bamboo sharks are found on the coral reefs of the Pacific Ocean and are commonly found in the waters surrounding Indonesia.

Mr Grieve added: 'We have a wonderful array of shark species here and with such encouraging breeding results we now have more than ever, we expect these babies to reach 30cm by the summer and one metre after a few years.

'We are confident our small new arrivals will settle in well.'
