Manchester United are unlikely to make any big signings in January, the club's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has revealed.

United announced a 10 per cent drop in income for the first quarter of this financial year due to the club's absence from the Champions League.

Revenue for the three months ending September 30 was £88.7million, down £9.8m compared with£98.5m for the same period a year ago, a 9.9 per cent drop.

Following the announcement Woodward was asked if the club - who spent a record £156m last summer - would spend when the transfer window reopened.

He said: 'Nothing has changed. We are not looking for short-term fixes.

'We have targets for next summer, should they become available in January we will have to look at it but it is a low probability.'

Woodward instead pointed to the club's prolific youth system, which has produced a string of top talents.

He said: 'We believe we are at the start of something special. Our fans are excited just like the board are excited by the team and the manager and think the team is heading in the right direction. 

'The first team now includes several players from the club’s academy. Youth development is part of the club’s DNA.'

Woodward, speaking to the media after announcing the Premier League club's 2014-15 financial results, says he has 'a real feeling we are at the start of something special'.
