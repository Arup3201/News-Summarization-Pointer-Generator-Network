A 34-year-old Louisiana high school teacher and her colleague have been arrested for allegedly having a threesome with a 16-year-old student after a football game last month.

Shelley Dufresne, of Montz, a married English teacher working at Destrehan High School, and her 24-year-old colleague Rachel Respess were charged Wednesday with carnal knowledge of a juvenile stemming from the September 12 incident.

Kenner Police Chief Michael Glaser said Respess invited Shelley and the 16-year-old to her home in the 1300 block of West Esplanade Avenue for a group tryst after the Destrehan-Helen Cox High School football game.

Detectives are now looking into rumors that the trio made a sex tape during their encounter.

Former students also told police that the trio have been involved in a sexual relationship for some time now.

After police learned of the allegations, they interviewed the student, who is now 17 years old, according to Nola.com.

The teen insisted that the sexual escapade was consensual. The age of consent in Louisiana is 17, and the victim was 16 at the time of the encounter with the teachers.

If convicted, the teachers could face up to 17-and-a-half years in prison.

‘No matter what sex the victim is, everyone should be outraged,' Glaser said. ‘You have an educator. Their responsibility is the safety and the education of children. 

'They should have known better.’

According to the police chief, Dufresne and Respess have been friends and both had taught the victim.

Dufrense was his teacher until this week, and he was in Respess' English class last year.

During questioning, Glaser said Repsess 'almost' came clean about her affair with the boy but stopped short of a full confession.

Shelley Dufresne was arrested at around 5.30pm Tuesday on a warrant listing one count of carnal knowledge of a juvenile. She declined to make a statement to police. 

According to deputies, school officials contacted the sheriff's office last Friday after the alleged victim reportedly bragged to other students that he was having sex with two teachers.

Officials with the St. Charles Parish Public School District also revealed that an investigation has been launched into a second incident involving Dufresne’s co-worker that allegedly occurred in another jurisdiction.

Shelley Dufresne, nee St Pierre, was released from the parish jail Tuesday evening on $200,000 bond and was placed under house arrest.

The married mother of three has been ordered not to leave her home except for continued mental health treatment, doctor appointments and church services. 

Wednesday morning, Rachel Respess turned herself in to the Kenner Police Department and was charged with carnal knowledge of a juvenile, indecent behavior and contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile. 

Ms Respass has been described as a Destrehan graduate who has been teaching English at the school for more than a year

Both teachers at the center of the criminal case have now been suspended without pay.

In custody: The 24-year-old now faces charges of carnal knowledge of a juvenile, indecent behavior and contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile.

Dufresne's profile on Destrehan High School's website, which has since been deleted, stated that she has taught English at the school, her alma mater, for nearly 10 years.

On her now-defunct page Dufresne reportedly wrote: 'I take my job and my students' education seriously and try my best to help all of my students be successful.

'I hope that all of my students have a great experience in my classroom and leave with the tools they need to be successful throughout the rest of their high school careers and in life,' reported the station WWL-TV.

She is the daughter of St Charles Parish Judge Emile St Pierre and the wife of Wesley Dufresne, a manager at a Louisiana oil company. The couple have three young kids.
