A corporate email address belonging to the CEO of Hachette was shared by Amazon with its customers.

In 'A Message from the Amazon Books Team,' Amazon said it has been campaigning against Hatchette for lower e-book prices.

At the bottom of the message, Amazon wrote 'We'd like your help. Please email Hachette and copy us.' Immediately below those words were Hachette CEO Michael Pietsch's email address and an Amazon address.

'Hachette has already been caught illegally colluding with its competitors to raise e-book prices,' Amazon alleged in its letter. 'So far those parties have paid $166 million in penalties and restitution.

'Colluding with its competitors to raise prices wasn't only illegal, it was also highly disrespectful to Hachette's readers.'

Amazon offered four talking points for customer emails in the message published on readersunited.com, AFP noted. One sample point echoed Amazon's earlier allegation: 'We have noted your illegal collusion.'

A letter on authorsunited.net earlier appeared from writers complaining about Amazon.

They alleged Amazon has intentionally made it difficult for customers to pre-order, buy and receive Hachette titles and '[b]oycotted Hachette authors.'

Those authors, in turn, wrote 'We respectfully ask you, our loyal readers, to email Jeff Bezos, CEO and founder of Amazon' and listed his email address.

'Without taking sides on the contractual dispute between Hachette and Amazon, we encourage Amazon in the strongest possible terms to stop harming the livelihood of the authors on whom it has built its business,' they said.

Amazon, however, has alleged its 'three separate offers to Hachette to take authors of out the middle' were rejected by the publishing company.

MailOnline received a letter from Pietsch, 'which he's sending to every individual who has emailed him,' a spokesperson said. 

Pietsch said 'This dispute started because Amazon is seeking a lot more profit and even more market share, at the expense of authors, bricks and mortar bookstores, and ourselves.  Both Hachette and Amazon are big businesses and neither should claim a monopoly on enlightenment, but we do believe in a book industry where talent is respected and choice continues to be offered to the reading public.

'Once again, we call on Amazon to withdraw the sanctions against Hachette’s authors that they have unilaterally imposed, and restore their books to normal levels of availability.  We are negotiating in good faith.  These punitive actions are not necessary, nor what we would expect from a trusted business partner.'

A request for comment to Amazon was not immediately returned.
