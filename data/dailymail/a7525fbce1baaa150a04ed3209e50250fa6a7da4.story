Cherie Blair was accused of ‘irresponsible scaremongering’ today after claiming legal aid cuts would make it easier for the state to take children into care.

The barrister wife of former Prime Minister Tony Blair attacked the coalition’s plans to remove £220 million from the legal aid budget by 2018-19.

She claimed parents would be in ‘trouble’ defending themselves against state moves to remove children, but the claims were angrily dismissed by the Ministry of Justice.

The government is pressing ahead with plans to cut £220 million from the legal aid budget by 2018-19

Hundreds of lawyers today marched on Westminster in protest the cuts as thousands of barristers stage a second walkout at courts in England and Wales.

Barristers have chosen not to attend proceedings at major crown courts in London, Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool, among others.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is pressing ahead with fee cutting fees for well-paid barristers and solicitors to save millions.

Scaremongering: Cherie Blair claimed parents would find it harder to stop their children being taken into care as a result of the cuts

But Mrs Blair, a QC, warned it was triggering a ‘real crisis’. She told Sky News: ‘Our criminal system doesn’t work unless each side is properly represented.

‘And the legal aid cuts, which could be as much as 30 per cent at the moment, mean it’s going to be more and more difficult for people where the state is taking you to court, whether it’s about a criminal offence or perhaps the state its taking your child into care, if you don’t get proper representation then you’re going to be in trouble defending yourself.’

However, the government hit back, insisting legal aid would still be available to cases involving children.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: ‘Our reforms present no change to the current system where anyone charged with a crime, or subject to criminal investigation, is provided with a qualified lawyer through legal aid.

‘We are only proposing average 6 per cent or 2 per cent changes to most barristers’ fees. After our reforms we will still be spending around £1.5 billion a year, meaning it will still be one of the most generous legal aid systems in the world.

‘As for claiming children will be taken into care without a lawyer being involved, that is just irresponsible scaremongering.

‘We have specifically ensured legal aid is, and will remain, available for these types of cases.’

Outside Parliament, banners were raised reading ‘Access to Justice RIP’ and ‘Save Legal Aid’.

Janis Sharp, whose son Gary McKinnon narrowly avoided extradition to the United States, Blur drummer-turned-solicitor Dave Rowntree and Paddy Hill, one of the Birmingham Six, were among those speaking at a rally opposite the Houses of Parliament. 

At the Old Bailey, only five out of 18 of the criminal courts were sitting today

Actress Maxine Peake, who plays a TV barrister, joined the protests.

The star, who plays QC Martha Costello in BBC1’s Silk, carried a placard declaring: 'Defend justice. Not just for the rich.'

She has warned: 'We have to send a message to this Government that we will no longer stand for their ferocious bullying of the poor.'

At the Old Bailey, only five out of 18 of the criminal courts were sitting today. The hacking trial and that of Nicky Jacobs for the murder of Pc Keith Blakelock were among those to resume on Monday.

Nigel Lithman, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA), said: ‘If these cuts are not addressed, then the British justice system, which is held in such high esteem around the world, will cease to exist as we know it and the British public can no longer expect true justice to be delivered.

‘It is simply expected that the criminal Bar will accept cuts unparalleled in any other sector of the wider community.

‘The Bar cannot and will not accept these unnecessary and crippling cuts and will continue to fiercely oppose them at every opportunity until our reasonable requests have been met with the appropriate levels of consideration.’

Barristers refused to attend court for the first time in January, causing widespread disruption to criminal justice.

The CBA and London Criminal Courts Solicitors Association (LCCSA) claim fee cuts are financially unnecessary, will cause significant damage to the criminal justice system, and drive skilled and experienced lawyers away from publicly-funded criminal work.

There are already a number of crown court cases emerging in which defendants have been unable to secure a barrister.

It is the second time that barristers have staged a walk out on the cuts, after the first in January

It is claimed that as a result of the changes junior barristers face rates as low as £20 a day

The Ministry of Justice has previously
 said it is vital to scale back 'one of the most expensive' legal aid 
schemes in the world and insisted it will remain 'very generous' even 
after the changes.

But the CBA said many junior barristers face rates
 as low as £20 a day, once the hours of preparation, time in court and 
chambers’ fees are factored in, as well as receiving no holiday pay, no 
pension provision and no sickness or maternity benefits.
