A father whose six-year-old son was killed in the Sandy Hook massacre has been attacked by a gun lobby who accused him of 'profiting off the tragedy'. 

Pro-gun lobbyists Connecticut Carry issued a press release on Wednesday that focused on Neil Heslin, writing: 'A felon with a long rap sheet of fraud, substance abuse and reckless behavior is the poster boy for background checks and gun bans. But not in the way he thinks he is.'

Mr Heslin, the father of Jesse Lewis who
died along with 25 others in the mass shooting at the elementary 
school in December, was scheduled to appear in Connecticut Superior 
Court on Wednesday.

Heslin, who has lobbied for stricter gun-control laws, faced charges stemming from bad checks he allegedly tried to pass from July 2011. He pleaded not guilty at the Connecticut court.

Around ten years ago, he was charged with drug possession and arrested over DUIs, according to the Huffington Post.

Connecticut Carry accused Mr Heslin of profiting from the Sandy Hook tragedy because of his gun control advocacy work which has involved him speaking before a Senate committee and meeting President Obama.

The pro-gun lobby claimed that Mr Heslin had been employed by Mayors Against Illegal Guns - but the group said that the grieving father's work is entirely unpaid.

Superior Court Judge Frank Iannotti ordered Heslin to explain on Wednesday why he was not in court on April 15. 

Heslin
was part of a contingent from Newtown that was meeting with U.S. 
senators that week, asking them to pass legislation that would have 
included universal background checks for gun purchases.

In two other cases, Heslin allegedly 
tried to pass a check from a closed account, in one case for more than 
$1,000 in home heating oil, and another for $102 in repairs on a vehicle
at a local tire shop, according to the News-Times of Danbury.

Heslin was asked by the News-Times if he thought his legal troubles might undermine his advocacy efforts.

'I
never gave it much thought. I guess you can look at it either way," he 
told the newspaper.

'If there's something to talk about, people are 
going to talk about it, good or bad, no matter what.'

Heslin's son, Jesse, was among 26 people shot dead inside Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14.
