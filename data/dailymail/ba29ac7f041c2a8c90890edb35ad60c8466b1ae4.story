This is the terrifying moment that two white vans nearly collided in the fast lane of a motorway after one driver passed a drink to another at almost 60mph.

The perilous stunt was caught on the dashboard camera of another driver - who was directly behind the two reckless motorists as they headed down the M5.

Road safety campaigners have slammed the manoeuvre claiming it could have easily have led to a crash with potentially lethal consequences.

'Risking lives': Road safety campaigners insist the pair should be punished by police for the dangerous stunt

The van drivers, yet to be identified, were filmed on the southbound carriageway near junction three at Halesowen, West Midlands, at around 6pm on September 24.

The driver who captured the incident, who does not want to be identified, said the pair were driving at around 56mph and appear to be passing a can of drink between each other.

He added: 'I thought it was a crazy and, frankly, a stupid thing to do. I was on my way home. I do a lot of driving as part of my job and I see a lot of stupid things on an almost daily basis. 

'You almost become immune to the stupidity, but this was particularly dangerous and it could have ended really badly.

'I really expected the vans to come together and for one of them to have his or her arms crushed. It was quite scary.'

Police are now examining the footage and said they will be contacting the owners of the vehicles. 

Road safety campaigners have condemned the drivers, saying they should be punished for risking other people's lives.

Philip Goose, senior community engagement officer at the road safety charity Brake, said: 'The video clearly shows that these two drivers were putting other road users and themselves in danger of being killed or seriously injured.

'Driving is the most dangerous thing we do on a daily basis and it deserves our full attention. Every day, five people die on our roads and a further 61 are seriously injured. 

'This kind of irresponsible behaviour on our roads needs to be punished, using the full force of the law.'

Chief Inspector Jared White, from the Central Motorway Police Group, said: 'Passing items between vehicles while they are moving at speed increases the risk of a collision and is therefore not only dangerous to those inside the vehicles concerned, but also to other road users.

'With regards to a video which appears to show two vans being driven in this way on the M5 on 24 September, we are currently examining the footage to see if any offences have been committed and we will be contacting the registered keepers of the vehicles about the matter.

'The drivers can contact us on 101.'
