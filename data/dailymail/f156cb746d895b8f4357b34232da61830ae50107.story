Little-known jockey Jamie Bargary was thrust into the spotlight on New Year’s Day at Cheltenham as he produced a faultless ride to win the feature race on Splash Of Ginge.

For the 20-year-old from Co Tipperary the 9-2 favourite’s three-and-a-quarter-length victory from Hunt Ball in the £50,000 BetBright Best For The Festival Handicap Chase was certainly a tale of the unexpected.

Bargary, who is based with trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies, had travelled to the track expecting to ride only Pigeon Island in an earlier race.

But when colleague Ryan Hatch sustained a collarbone injury as Little Jon fell in the Dipper Novices’ Chase won by Ptit Zig, Twiston-Davies handed the responsibility of the mount on Splash Of Ginge to Bargary even though his career total of wins under rules was only five.

Bargary said: ‘I had about a quarter-of-an-hour’s notice. I had my suit on and was ready to leave. The Pigeon Island ride was good enough. He ran a blinder to finish fifth.’

Bargary, who had ridden only nine point-to-point winners, joined Twiston-Davies a little over a year ago after spending two years with David Pipe. He added that, anticipating only one ride, he had not set his TV to record the big race but he was sure to have plenty of reminders last night in The Hollow Bottom, the Twiston-Davies stable’s local pub.

It was there that Splash Of Ginge’s owner John Neild and his ‘Ginge Army’, which yesterday numbered 50, had toasted their talented gelding’s win in last season’s prestigious Betfair Hurdle and the plan was for a repeat.

Twiston-Davies said: ‘It is only Jamie’s sixth winner but he is very good. It was a faultless display of jockeyship. John Neild is so kind to the boys, he likes to give them all a chance. Ryan Hatch stepped in when Splash Of Ginge won the Betfair Hurdle.

‘The landlord of the Hollow Bottom is probably ordering more beer as we speak. After the Betfair Hurdle it took them two-and-a-half days to leave there.’

Splash Of Ginge was travelling well when he fell four out in the Caspian Caviar Gold Cup, won by Niceonefrankie, at Cheltenham’s December meeting. His owner’s Liverpudlian roots will make Aintree a target later this season but, before that, Twiston-Davies intends returning the seven-year-old to the novice ranks with the JLT Chase at the Festival being his target.

Lying in wait there will be the Paul Nicholls-trained Ptit Zig, an impressive six-length winner of the Dipper Chase yesterday under Sam Twiston-Davies.

Being a Grade One winner over hurdles and good enough to run in last season’s Champion Hurdle, when he was sixth to Jezki, the two-mile Arkle Chase might have seemed Ptit Zig’s natural target but Nicholls is adamant he will get better as he goes up in trip.

Yesterday’s race, in which he beat Champagne West six lengths, was over two miles five furlongs, and Nicholls sees next season’s three-mile King George as a longer-term target.

Nicholls also landed the BetBright On Mobile Handicap Chase with Grand National possible Mon Parrain, whose jockey Sean Bowen helped make it a big day for the young faces in the weighing room.

The 17-year-old son of Welsh trainer Peter Bowen went on to complete a 285-1 double on his father’s Rolling Maul in the Betbright Casino Handicap Hurdle.

The two wins were his first at Cheltenham and followed his first ever treble at Chepstow on Welsh National day.

Little wonder he is being tipped as a rider to follow. Nicholls said: ‘Horses seem to run for him. He will be very good.’
