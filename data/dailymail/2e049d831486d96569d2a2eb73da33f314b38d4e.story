Hunting is a sport that often takes place in spectacular surroundings.

While some hunters may be tempted to try to capture these environments-and their unassuming target-in an opportunistic selfie, the margin of error is large.

Footage has emerged of professional bow-hunter Cameron Hanes pausing from stalking a water buffalo in the Australian Outback to take a selfie of the animal, only for it to panic and run away.

Seemingly unphased, Hanes then approaches the camera man and says with a smile: ‘Don’t take a selfie at crunch time.’

‘The good thing is,’ he continues, ‘this place is so awesome I’m not even worried about it.’ 

A herd of water buffaloes can be seen fleeing in the distance as he begins to line up another photograph on his phone. 

A native of Oregon in America, Hanes is an influential figure in the bow hunting community, hosting seminars at annual hunting events.

The video, uploaded to YouTube on Monday, was captured somewhere in ‘Australian back country,’ according to the description.

It comes after a series of hunting photo misadventures in 2014.

In July, a Belgian teenager who scored a modelling deal with L’Oreal had her contract cancelled after public furore over a Facebook image of her posing next a dead gazelle she hunted in Africa.

Axelle Despiegelaere, 17, had scored the contract after images of her in the crowd of a world cup match between Belgium and the United States went viral.

Texas cheerleader Kendall Jones, 19, sparked outrage for sharing images of herself next to slain lions, elephants and zebras she hunted in Africa.

Facebook deleted the images in July following a petition signed by a quarter of a million people urging Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to have them removed.
