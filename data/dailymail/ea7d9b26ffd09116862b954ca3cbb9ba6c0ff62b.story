Young members of the feared MS-13 gang are believed to be trying to recruit the unaccompanied children they are crossing the U.S. border with.

At least 16 of the youngsters being held at an Arizona border processing center have been identified as part of the gang, which has its roots in Central America.

The gang members, who admitted to carrying out torture and murder before heading to the U.S., are believed to have also used the center's Red Cross phones to communicate with criminal networks.

Notorious: Members of the MS-13 gang, which has links to cartels and a reputation for deadly violence, have been identified at a border center

Spotted: Border staff at Nogales center in Arizona, above, say they identified 16 MS-13 members

Details of alleged gang activity at the Nogales processing center was revealed in a Fox News report, which questioned why known criminals in foreign countries were being allowed into the U.S.

Although the gang members are aged from 15 to 17, they admitted to being involved in disturbing acts of violence.

An agent, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Townhall: 'We have six minors in Nogales who have admitted to killing and doing grievous bodily injuries. One admitted to killing as young as eight years old.

'They are being held for placement in the U.S,' the agent added.

Border patrol has confirmed that MS13 members were identified in the center, and said 13 came from El Salvador, two were from Guatemala, and one traveled from Honduras.

The MS-13 gang is notorious for its links to cartels and organized crime, and its ability to access high-powered weapons.

Because of unrest in Central America, many of the original gang members had guerrilla warfare experience, making them more deadly than other criminal groups.

Gang life: Members of MS-13 often identify themselves with prominent tattoos and sports jerseys bearing numbers that are significant to the group

Signs: The gang members were discovered after graffiti similar to the one pictures in El Salvador, above, was spotted in a bathroom at the immigration center

The members often display their gang affiliation in tattoos, some spread prominently over the face, chest and back.

Border agents were allegedly tipped off to the presence of the gang in the processing center after graffiti was spotted in the boys' bathroom.

Because the gang members are under the age of 18, the U.S. is unable to lawfully return them to their home countries.

A recent surge in the number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border has also made it is difficult for staff at the center to separate suspected gang members from the vulnerable children.

'They’re 
trying to recruit other teenage boys that are sharing cells with them 
and they’re using the phones that the Red Cross has set up,' Katie Pavlich, of Fox News, said.

'They’re 
supposed to be using those to call back home or to call family members 
in the United States. They’re also using those as a way to communicate 
with gang members already in U.S. cities.'

Rules: Because the gang members are under 18, under U.S. law border agents are unable to remove them from the Arizona center, above

A border agent had raised fears about gangs last month, saying: 'If he’s a confirmed gang member in his own country, why are we letting him in here?'

Officials running the border centers, which are overwhelmed with immigrants, said there was little they could do to tackle the gang problem.

'Agents' hands are tied due to the policies governing the care and lodging of juveniles and this has allowed gang recruitment and activity to flourish amongst those being detained,' National Border Patrol Council's vice-chairman Shawn Moran told Townhall.

Homeland Security has been informed of the 16 known MS-13 gang members in the youth facility.
