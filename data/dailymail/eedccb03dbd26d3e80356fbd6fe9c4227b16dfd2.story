A Thai carer who bludgeoned to death her pensioner lover with a claw hammer after he changed his will to leave her £340,000 was today jailed for life.

Bunthawee Rimmer, 49, launched the frenzied attack on veteran soldier Paul Norfolk with a 12oz hammer as he slept.

She arrived in Britain in 1998 after her late husband Geoffrey Rimmer met her on a Thai beach while she was selling doughnuts.

Mr Rimmer died in xxx and Bunthawee the started a sexual relationship with Mr Norfolk - her dead husband's best friend - in 2010 after she was employed to care for his sick wife Esme, who suffers from alzheimer's.

Murder: Paul Norfolk, 77, was bludgeoned to death with a claw hammer by his Thai lover Bunthawee Rimmer, 49, after he left her everything in his will. She was today jailed for life

She savagely hacked her OAP lover to death just three months after he changed his will to leave her his entire £340,000 estate - instead of his frail wife.

When police broke into Mr Norfolk's home on December 31 last year they found Rimmer lying on the bed next to his bloodied body.

The killer, also known as Pacer, had slit her own throat, stabbed herself in the chest, taken an overdose and even drunk toilet cleaner in a failed bid to take her own life.

She was taken to hospital but was arrested and taken into police custody on 31 December, when medics released her.

Rimmer told police she believed Mr Norfolk planned to throw her out of his home, a claim which a judge rejected.

Rimmer accepted
killing Mr Norfolk, but denied murder and claimed diminished 
responsibility, blaming depression she was suffering from at the time.

A jury  found Rimmer guilty of murder by a majority verdict having deliberated for seven hours and 35 minutes.

Jailing her at Ipswich Crown Court, with a minimum tariff of 11 years, Mr Justice John Saunders said Rimmer's attack had been 'wicked'.

He said: 'I do not lose sight of the fact that a decent man has lost his life in a brutal fashion at the age of 77.

'Paul Norfolk was by all accounts a well liked, decent man. His death is a tragedy for his family, some of whom have given evidence and demonstrated admirable fairness and restraint in the way they did this.

'No-one should lose their life in the way that Paul Norfolk did.

'It was a wicked thing to do, as I am satisfied the defendant recognised and led to her trying to kill herself.'

Mr Justice John Saunders added: 'I am satisfied that the defendant's account that Paul Norfolk was saying that he was going to dispense with her services as a carer was untrue.

'It is inconsistent with the rest of the evidence which was to the effect that Paul Norfolk was saying that he couldn't live without the defendant.

'In the early hours of the morning of the 30th December the defendant armed herself with her hammer and struck Paul Norfolk at least twelve fierce blows with the hammer.

'I will deal with the defendant on the basis that this was a determined attempt on her own life and she did cause herself significant injury.

'I do not know why she killed Paul Norfolk. Thereafter in prison I am satisfied that her mental state, which was affected by depression, deteriorated further.'

Rimmer murdered Mr Norfolk in the early hours of December 30 last year by hitting him over the head 12 times with a claw hammer while he was asleep.

The court heard she had heard voices when she got up in the night, saying: 'Dead, dead, dead.'

The killer later admitted to 'vaguely' remembering making a cup of tea and going downstairs to pick up a hammer and three knives.

During her trial prosecutors told the court she had moved into Mr Norfolk's home in Haverhill, Suffolk, in 2010, after her own husband died of natural causes.

She carried on living in the semi-detached house after Mrs Norfolk, who she cared for, was moved into a care home.

Later she started a sexual relationship with Mr Norfolk, who was a former employee of scent firm International Flowers and Fragrances (IFF), in Haverhill.

The pensioner, who served in the army's Tank Regiment for three years from the age of 18, then changed his will three months before his death to leave his entire estate to Rimmer instead of his wife.

Speaking through an interpreter, Rimmer, who has a son from a previous marriage, said that she had felt sad because Mr Norfolk told her he wanted to 'dump her'.

Andrew Johnson, prosecuting, said: 'I put it to you that, for reasons that you do not want to tell this jury, you decided to kill Mr Norfolk.'

Rimmer replied: 'I have never thought of killing Mr Norfolk. I love him. I have no reason to kill him.'

When asked about her sexual relationship with Mr Norfolk, Rimmer replied: 'I did not really want to but I wanted to please him because I knew it would make him happy. When he was angry he would grab my shoulders.'

When asked why she did not call an ambulance after Mr Norfolk was injured, she said that she was unaware of what had happened because of the pills she had taken.

Following the sentence Mr Norfolk's family released a statement paying tribute to him.

It read: 'Paul was the youngest of a family of four and had a happy childhood in the village of Ridgewell. We were a happy and united family. Paul was a popular and well liked member of the community.

'At eighteen years old, he joined the Tank Regiment and served in the army for three years. He was well-liked by his army friends and was still in touch with one of them at the time of his death.

'For thirty years he was employed at IFF in Haverhill. Upon marriage he settled into his house in Castle Lane, where he was still living at the time of his death.

'Paul was a very generous, kind and sympathetic man. He was liked and respected by everyone who knew him especially by his neighbours and their children by whom he was affectionately called 'Uncle'. He was always ready to help others.

'His brother and I (both in our eighties) are completely devastated by the wickedly cruel way in which our gentle, loving and much loved brother was taken from us. It was a blow from which we shall never recover.

'Our remaining years will be spent grieving for him, who brought joy and happiness into our lives and whom we shall always remember as our dearest Paul. With all our love, Peter and Pansy.'
