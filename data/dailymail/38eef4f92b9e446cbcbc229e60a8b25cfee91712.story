One in six families are ‘workless’, the fewest since records began in 1996, the Office for National Statistics has said.

The ONS said 17.1 per cent of households have no adults aged 16 to 64 with a job, compared with 19.2 per cent when the Coalition came to power.

Typically, those in workless houses are either looking for a job but unable to find one, or ‘inactive’, which covers anything from being a housewife to being too ill to work.

The facts: The number of workless households has dropped to a new low since records began in 1996

Bad news: There are still 500,000 people in Britain who have never worked for a variety of reasons

Households which do not have any working age adults are excluded from the figures.

The
fall is an endorsement of Work and Pensions Minister Iain Duncan 
Smith’s welfare reforms, designed to make finding work more attractive.

Mark Hoban, the Employment Minister, said helping people off benefits is ‘one of this Government’s top priorities’. 

He
said: ‘By reforming the welfare system to ensure that people are better
off in work than on benefits, and through schemes such as the Work 
Programme and Youth Contract, we are giving people the support they need
to get a job.’

Since 2010, the number of workless households has dropped by around 427,000 to 3.5million.

One in seven children, around 1.6million, live in a workless home The majority – 65 per cent – have a single parent.

There
remain huge regional variations in worklessness, with 23 per cent of 
households workless in the North East, compared with  13 per cent in the
South East and 14 per cent in the East.

The ONS figures also show the number of households where no one has ever had a job is falling.There are 297,000 households ‘in which no adult has ever worked’, down 43,000 in a year.

The ONS said the sharp fall in workless households over the last year, down by 182,000, was partly due to our ageing society.

One-person
workless households with adults aged 50 to 64 saw the ‘greatest fall’, 
but the number of such households with adults aged 65 and over grew.

The report said this ‘is partly due to some workless households moving from the 16 to 64 age group to the 65 and over group’.

So-called workless households stood at 
17.1 per cent in the three months to June, down from 17.9 per cent a 
year ago and 19.2 cent in the same period in 2010.

The number of households where no one has ever worked stands at 297,000, down by 43,000 over the past year.
