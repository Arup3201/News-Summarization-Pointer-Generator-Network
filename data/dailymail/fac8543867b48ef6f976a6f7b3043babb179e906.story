Most tourists visiting the capital will call in at Big Ben and visit Buckingham Palace, but very few will venture beyond to some of the secret - but equally beautiful - sights in London. 

However, one photographer has dedicated four years of his life to tracking down some of the most unusual and overlooked attractions in the city, taking beautiful photos to celebrate their history.

From corridors of power to shrines of religion and music, photographer Peter Dazeley has caught them all on camera for a book entitled 'Unseen London'.

The Crossness Pumping Station, in Bexley was designed as part of the sewer works created by Sir Joseph Bazalgette and opened in 1865. Following vandalism after it became defunct in the 1950s, but volunteers have helped restore its beautiful Victorian heritage

Designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott and Matthew Digby Wyatt, the Foreign Office in Durbar Court, SW1, was first used in 1867 when it was the India Office building

Freemasons’ Hall, built between 1927 and 1932 in Great Queen Street, is the headquarters of the United Grand Lodge of England and the principal meeting place for Masonic Lodges in London, and right, the Lloyds General Committee Room in the Collcutt building at 71 Fenchurch Street, the highlight of Thomas Edward Colcutt's architectural genius

The Freemasons Grand Temple has an elaborate match of tradition and modern fare. The building is fully open to the public and free tours are available most week days

Londoner Peter, 66,compiled his labour of love after first being inspired by a view from his own apartment across the Thames from Battersea Power Station.

He said: 'I'm a Londoner myself and my apartment between the Chelsea and Vauxhall Bridges overlooked the Battersea Power Station.

'Over the years I saw it's transformation and when I was first allowed in there to photograph it was incredible.

'It was the change of this building that inspired me to think what other great parts of London nobody had seen or knew about.

'The city is constantly evolving and some of these buildings will be lost without someone ever seeing them.

Abbey Road Studios' Studio One in St John's Wood has an extensive range of classic and modern outboard equipment; any operator of this would certainly have to know what they are doing however

Abbey Road Studios were made famous by The Beatles, who recorded an album of the same name, which of course, featured the group walking over the pedestrian crossing outside the venue

Studio One is the largest purpose-built recording studio and can comfortably house a 110-piece orchestra

'Now Battersea is set to hold three hotels, 3,990 apartments, 250 shops and restaurants with a studio going for £950,000.'

In his stunning pictures some unlikely locations prove themselves real hidden gems - like the incredible interior of the 1859 Crossness Pumping Station, in Bexley.

Peter said: 'The irony is that this pumping station was designed as part of the sewer works created by Sir Joseph Bazalgette to take the waste out of London. But his ancestor went on to produce TV's Big Brother, in my opinion bringing it back in.

Abbey Road Studios has become a favourite tourist attraction, with fans keen to leave their own personal mark there, and right,  the BT Tower imposes from near and far

This motor provides the power for the BT Tower's revolving floor, that has once housed a restaurant. Nowadays the venue is reserved for specially-organised trips 

Lancashire Boilers used coal to power two pumping engines that pumped water from a reservoir under the floor into the hydraulic system that helped open Tower Bridge up for ships to pass

While Tower Bridge is recognisable from the front, if you were shown this photo you might not know you were in the bascule chamber underneath one of London's famous landmarks

 'The interior of Midland Bank was interesting, it goes back to a time when people respected their bank manager. It includes bespoke furniture including a cupboard for the management's top hats and a drawer below for their canes.

'And people don't realise Abbey Studios which I photographed is big enough to hold a symphony orchestra, for film scores, and they still record in analogue.

'The BT Tower is open to access and what fascinated me was the tiny lawnmower sized engine responsible for revolving the top floor of the Tower.

St Sophia's Greek Orthodox Cathedral on Moscow Road, Bayswater, was built in 1879 by the Greek community in London. It is built in the form of a cruciform basilica with a central dome

Battersea Power Station is a decommissioned coal-fired power station located on the south bank of the River Thames. The development of flats and houses could see the area become more like a village in a city

'A lot of the buildings in the book you can get in to see but it's not easy and you can perhaps only have five minutes in them.'For example I've walked past the Mason's building in Convent Garden thousands of times and had no idea of the hidden gem inside. '

'Unseen London was a four year journey of discovery starting with Battersea Power Station. Many photographs in this book will be the last record of a disappearing world.'

Harrow School provides a high class of boarding education for children in London. There is some evidence of a school being on the site as far back as 1243, but the one we know today is believed to have dated back to 1572

Winston Churchill and Stanley Baldwin are some of the most famous alumni of Harrow School; more recent old scholars include actor Benedict Cumberbatch and and current England rugby international Billy Vunipola

The squash courts at Harrow school, where the yearly fees are almost £36,000 for education and boarding 

The Midland Bank board room is found close to the Guildhall and Bank of England in the City. The building was built between 1924-1939 and Lutyens designed the exterior elevations plus the ground floor banking hall, basement safe deposit area, directors' and boardroom floors plus staircases and certain other areas
