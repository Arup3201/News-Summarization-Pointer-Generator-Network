When we feel ill, most of us ring the doctor or reach for a paracetamol.

But former EastEnders star Michelle Collins embraces a far more unconventional approach when it comes to her health.

The 51-year-old actress uses homeopathy - an alternative medicine - to treat her ailments and says she has been an advocate for almost 20 years.

Miss Collins also praises the ‘mind and body’ aspect of homeopathy and claims that it is especially helpful when dealing with stage fright and nerves.

She was introduced to homeopathy - a practice that was discovered around 200 years ago and that treats symptoms with a ‘like for like’ approach - when her daughter Maia was born as a natural way of treating teething, chesty coughs and colds.

And her daughter, now 17, still uses homeopathy, Miss Collins said. She continued: ‘Maia is soon off to university and still using homeopathy herself for anxiety when dealing with exam stress and hay fever.’

Miss Collins, who also starred in EastEnders’ rival soap Coronation Street for three years, said that homeopathy makes her feel more in control of her body and added: ‘I am passionate about personalised and approachable healthcare.

‘Homeopathy treats the individual as a whole, taking into account mind and body, which is important.’

Miss Collins, who is currently starring 
in The Glass Supper at the Hampstead Theatre in London, added: ‘I was 
getting anxious about the opening and it [homeopathy] really helped 
settle my nerves and keep my concentration.’

The actress has admitted to previously suffering from depression following her departure from EastEnders and splitting from Maia’s father, Fabrizio Tassalini.

She said the pressure and stress got so much that she even attempted to take her own life while filming the BBC drama Sunburn in 1998.

Miss 
Collins has said she has never attempted anything like that since and that 
homeopathy should be more widely available on the NHS.

Homeopathy is a system of medicine which involves treating a patient with highly diluted substances, aiming to trigger the body’s natural system of healing.It is based on a series of ideas developed in the 1790s by a German doctor called Samuel Hahnemann.Some of the most common conditions homeopathy is used to cure are asthma, mental illnesses such as depression or anxiety, dermatitis and arthritis.Remedies are made from plants - such as jasmine or witch-hazel, metals, minerals and chemicals.

She added: ‘Homeopathy is very important to healthy living. It empowers you to take control of your health.

‘The NHS should be looking to things like this to help manage spiralling costs as it is soinexpensive and effective, plus conventional drugs can have horrible side-effects which make things worse.’

According to the British Homeopathic Association, one in eight Brits use homeopathy but the organisation, who Miss Collins has recently become an ambassador for, also said that the majority of the nation know very little about it as a complementary medicine.

Homeopathy was discovered by German doctor Samuel Hahnemann, who was shocked at the harsh medical practices of his day and the harsh side effects. His aim was to find an alternative approach and he believed that by using highly diluted substances the body could potentially heal itself.

Cristal Sumner, Chief Executive of the British Homeopathic Association, added: ‘We are thrilled to have Michelle on board, she is passionate about healthy living and has used homeopathy for years.

‘She is a household name, an amazing talent and someone we know will bring awareness of homeopathy to a new and greater audience.’
