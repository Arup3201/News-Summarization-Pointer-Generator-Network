Freedom at a cost: George Zimmerman racked up legal fees of $2.5million dollars as he was acquitted of killing Trayvon Martin earlier this year

George Zimmerman racked up $2.5million in legal fees defending himself against a murder charge, his defense attorneys have revealed.

The 30-year-old was acquitted of killing Trayvon Martin earlier this year, but his freedom has come at a cost.

He received the legal bill from lead attorneys Mark O'Mara and Don West two months ago.

O'Mara initially took the case on in April 2012 at no charge to Zimmerman.

But he later found out that the Zimmerman family were raising funds to fight the charge via a website appeal.

More than $400,000 was donated to the fund by his supporters.

The lawyer said during the trial that he and Mr West had not been paid but hoped that they would be in the future.

They were paid a 'minute amount' following Zimmerman's acquittal, according to Mr O'Mara.

The attorneys are thought to have benefited financially from the case even if they haven't be paid.

O'Mara spent more than $52,000 on 'law firm support and infrastructure' - upgrading computer software, improved office security and new phones - earlier this year.

The pair also formed the Timber Run Enterprises LLC partnership and bought the building next to O'Mara's existing Orlando office for $270,000.

O'Mara has denied that the building was paid for using Zimmerman's defense money and said that instead it was leased to O'Mara's firm and that the defense money was used to pay rent.

Zimmerman was acquitted in July of all charges, including second-degree murder over the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, during a five-week trial.

He told police that he shot the teenager in self-defence after the unarmed youngster attacked him.

Both the killing itself and the trial verdict prompted widespread demonstrations across the US.

Orlando criminal defence lawyer Richard Hornsby described the $2.5million bill as 'mind-numbing'

Clients are more often than not charged a flat rate fee rather than a by the hour rate.

In other cases where the client cannot afford a defense team, a nonrefundable retainer is paid to the lawyer and that covers legal costs until it runs out.

After that money has been exhausted lawyers tend to charge by the hour.

But the attorneys describe the charge as reasonable given that O'Mara charges $400 an hour and West $350.

According to court paperwork, Zimmerman had no funds when the case begun and is unemployed and going through a divorce at present.

He is also facing charges in a domestic violence case in Seminole County.

Zimmerman is free on $9,000 bail on charges of aggravated assault, battery and criminal mischief. He has pleaded not guilty.

It emerged earlier this week that he had five guns and more than 100 rounds of ammunition with him when deputies arrested him.

A search warrant made public on Tuesday by the Seminole County court clerk shows that Zimmerman had a 12-gauge shotgun, an AR-15 assault rifle and three handguns when he was arrested on November 18 at his girlfriend's house.

The girlfriend, Samantha Scheibe, told deputies that Zimmerman pointed a shotgun at her during an argument.
