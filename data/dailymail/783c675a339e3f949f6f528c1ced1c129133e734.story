If you've every dreamed of personalising your iPhone, this company can certainly provide some assistance - but you'll need a bank account worthy of an oligarch.

The world's most expensive iPhone 6 has been unveiled and not only is it made of 24-carat gold, it is encrusted with dozens of tiny diamonds.

But if you want to snap up the exclusive design, you'll need a spare £2.3million ($3.51million).

The company behind the outrageous design, which sees the Apple logo made up of diamonds as well as lining the side of the device with the precious jewels, is called Goldgenie.

It reportedly counts Usain Bolt, former football star David Beckham and rapper and music producer P Diddy among its clients.

Founder Laban Roomes said: 'This is probably the most exclusive phone at this time, date in the world, I would say it as worth as much as a small island.'

The 'Diamond Ecstasy iPhone' can be customised further to meet client's wishes, with a choice of gold, platinum or rose-gold finishes as well as personally chosen diamonds or other gemstones.

But if you can't afford to splash out on the diamond edition, Goldgenie offers personalised phones starting from £9,700 ($15,000). 

It is not the first time a company has offered an outrageously expensive iPhone for sale.

Last year designer Alexander Amosu created a gold iPhone 6 covered in 6,127 diamonds for an anonymous client.

A solid gold Apple logo was also fixed to the back and whole handset cost the customer £1.7million ($2.62million)
