Row: Dr Laurence Buckman said GPs were fed up with being blamed for chaos in A&E departments

Doctors yesterday accused Jeremy Hunt of ‘spouting rubbish’, after he said their controversial contracts had led to worse services for patients.

The head of the British Medical Association’s GP committee said doctors were being made the ‘whipping boys’ for wider problems in the NHS.

Dr Laurence Buckman said it was unfair to blame doctors for the increased pressure at accident and emergency departments.

The war of words has escalated in recent weeks, with the Health Secretary insisting family doctors must once again take ultimate responsibility for round-the-clock care.

Mr Hunt has angered GPs by suggesting the out-of-hours arrangements introduced in 2004 are partly to blame for the A&E crisis, and he stepped up his criticism by condemning the scandal of out-of-hours services where ‘you speak to a doctor who doesn’t know you from Adam’.

He acknowledged that the causes of the A&E crisis were ‘complex’, and partly explained by Britain’s ageing population, but said doctors could take more ‘responsibility’ for their patients.

He said: ‘We need to have a clinician accountable for those people when they are outside hospital just in the same way a consultant is responsible for them when they are inside hospital, if we are going to give them the kind of care we all want the NHS to do. It’s a big change and I think the GP contract is part of the problem.’

Personal service: Patients should know that one family doctor (file picture) is responsible for them, and even if their GP is not on call it will be clear that 'the buck stops' with them, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt insists

Accusing Mr Hunt of ‘spouting 
rubbish’ on the issue, Mr Buckman said: ‘He does not want to bother with
the facts when he can have a bash at those of us who on his own 
admission are overworked and strained beyond endurance.

‘GPs are not prepared to shore up a 
system that has been rendered unsafe by political meddling.’ Mr Buckman 
said the ‘botched’ introduction of the non-emergency 111 phone line had 
left people ‘confused’ about where to go for care.

He added: ‘People who go to A&E 
are not going because of GPs. There is no doubt some of it is because 
people are confused about how to get access to out-of-hours services and
some of it is because NHS 111 is sending people there.

‘But some of it is about a rapid rise in demand. We are seeing more people than ever before.’ 
Mr Hunt, who wants to introduce a new Chief Inspector of GPs, said 
reform was urgently needed. He insisted many GPs were keen to make 
changes that would allow them to devote more attention to their 
patients.

Mr Hunt insisted the Labour government's 2004 contracts for GPs were in part to blame for problems being seen now

Mr Hunt said he did not want to 
return to the days of GPs getting calls directly from patients at 2am, 
adding he acknowledged they worked extremely hard. ‘What I question is 
whether we are allowing them to do the things they went into general 
practice to do.

‘What we make them do on the contract
is make them tick lots and lots of boxes. I want to change that. I 
think the current GP contract is fundamentally flawed by removing 
responsibility for out-of-hours services from GPs.’

Mr Hunt added that the ‘buck should 
stop’ with GPs for out-of-hours care. While family doctors shouldn’t 
have to personally deliver such care for their patients, they should 
have to ‘sign off’ to confirm that they are pleased with the service 
that is providing care, he said.
