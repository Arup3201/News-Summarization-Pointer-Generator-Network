If everything you want from a beach is sand, calm water and plenty of room to spread your towel, then this one has it all.

But you would have to climb 780ft above sea level to the heart of the wild Pennine range to find it.

Britain’s highest and perhaps most secret beach is 60 miles from the coast and only accessible via a 40-minute walk up a steep footpath above the village of Todmorden, West Yorkshire.

Secret beach: Sun-seekers enjoy the warm weather on Britain's highest beach located at the Gaddings Reservoir almost 800ft above sea level in the South Pennines hills, West Yorkshire

In the middle of nowhere: The little-known cove situated near the market town of Todmorden is a haven for local sun worshippers wanting to get away from it all

It doesn't get better than this:

Despite its remote location, the cove, located next to the Gaddings Dam, is a popular spot for locals in the know.

And as the temperatures climb in the 
summer heatwave, villagers have been heading to the spot with beachwear,
 lilos and buckets and spades.

Lauren Hurst has lived in Todmorden 
all her life but only visited the beach for the first time last week. 
Now she has fallen in love with it.

The 24-year-old, who works at the 
Shepherd’s Rest pub three miles from the beach, said: ‘I have been to 
the beach three times in the past week, and although I knew it was there
 I didn’t know how nice it actually was.

‘Even though it’s relatively quiet during the week, the beach is absolutely packed with local people on a weekend.’

Worth the wait: Determined locals have to climb up steep footpaths for 40 minutes from the nearest village Todmorden to reach the isolated beach

Pub landlady Janet Sefton, 55, added: 
‘We have seen families absolutely pack the beach out recently, with 
barbecues and canoes being brought up to the spot. It’s incredible that 
we have a beach so high up and miles away from the nearest coast.

‘It does take a good walk to get to the beach, and it’s not for the faint-hearted, but it is totally worth it in the end.

‘It’s a fantastic spot and such a unique and secluded beach, and it brings us great trade to our pub from visitors to the area.’

Gaddings Dam covers an area of about 
four acres and contains 100,000 cubic metres of water. The dam has been 
emptied in the past, but by the 1960s it was full again and has remained
 so ever since.

The sandy beach in its north-east corner is thought to be a natural feature, as sandstone dominates the local geology.

Another theory is the sand was left over after the dam’s wall was built.

At the turn of the century, a survey said the reservoir needed so much repair work that it was recommended for closure.

But in 2001, enthusiast Jolyon Trimingham formed a pressure group to save it.

The owner eventually sold it to a preservation group for £1,500, provided it was kept for the people of Todmorden.

Exclusive: The difficulty of the climb to the beach and its location means that only a handful of people visit it even on the hottest days of the year

Janet Sefton, 55, landlady at the nearby pub, said the beach is almost as popular with  residents as nearby seaside destination Blackpool.

She said: 'We have seen families absolutely pack the beach out recently, with  barbecues and canoes being brought up to the spot. It's incredible that we have a beach so high up and miles away from the  nearest coast.

'It does take a good walk to get to the beach, and it's not for the faint  hearted but it is totally worth it in the end.

Gaddings Dam is approximately four acres and contains 100,000 cubic metres of  water. The dam has been emptied in the past but by the 1960s was full again and has  remained so ever since.

The sand in the north-east corner is thought to be naturally occuring, as  sandstone dominates the local geology. Another theory is the sand was a by-product of dressing the stones for the  dam's wall.

Local knowledge: The picturesque spot was found by local walkers who then spread the word via Twitter and Facebook

Splashing around: Alyssiea Endley and Lauren Hurst were among those to brave the long walk to the beach to enjoy the cool water in the reservoir

Beauty spot: The sandy beach also offers stunning views across the South Pennines in West Yorkshire
