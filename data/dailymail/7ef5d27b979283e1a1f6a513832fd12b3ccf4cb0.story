Adams said: 'Ever since it was announced that women's boxing was going to be part of the Commonwealth Games I have been really looking forward to this event.

'The Commonwealth's is the only major tournament that I have left to win a medal at so I am really determined to do well and give myself the best possible chance of making history for a second time.'

Adams is joined in the squad by fellow London Olympian Natasha Jonas at 60kgs and reigning middleweight world champion Savannah Marshall.

The eight-strong men's line-up includes world championship bronze medallist Anthony Fowler at middleweight and two European bronze medallists in Charlie Edwards and Joe Joyce.
