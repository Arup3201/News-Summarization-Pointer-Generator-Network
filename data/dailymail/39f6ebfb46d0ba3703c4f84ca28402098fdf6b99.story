Not content to bring back Darrelle Revis, the New York Jets have re-signed Antonio Cromartie too.

The pair played together for the Jets from 2010-12 and after his return to Gang Green after winning the Super Bowl with New England, Revis announced he would reach out to recruit 30-year-old Cromartie.

'I’m going to get in contact with him very soon here,' he said, 'and try to convince him to hopefully come back and join our Batman-and-Robin tandem we had a couple of years ago,' Revis said. 

Cromartie obviously liked what he heard and re-joins on a four-year, $32million contract.

He expressed his delight on Twitter, saying: 'Something like a dynamic duo.. Happy to shutdown QB's with my bro @revis24 again!'

As Todd Bowles begins to put his stamp on the franchise, Cromartie is the third cornerback to join after Revis and Buster Skrine, who signed from the Cleveland Browns.

The secondary is a key area for improvement after the Jets allowed an AFC-high 31 touchdown passes. They are said to be interested in Marcus Gilchrist, who is now a free agent after four years with the San Diego Chargers, ESPN report.

Bowles, who was defensive co-ordinator, and Cromartie worked together in Arizona for a season as the Cardinals reached the playoffs for the first time since 2009.
