Criticism: Departing SEC attorney James Kidney said in his leaving speech that his bosses were too fearful of Wall Street chiefs

A lawyer from America’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched a broadside against his bosses during a leaving speech, accusing them of being too soft on wayward Wall Street chiefs in the wake of the 2008 credit crisis.

James Kidney, who retired from the SEC this month after 24 years with the organisation, said in his leaving speech that his bosses had been too ‘tentative and fearful’ when tackling the behaviour of banking giants.

As around 70 SEC lawyers and alumni looked on, Mr Kidney bemoaned the SEC’s focus on being polite.

He said: ‘[The SEC has become] an agency that polices the broken windows on the street level and rarely goes to the penthouse floors. On the rare occasions when enforcement does go to the penthouse, good manners are paramount. Tough enforcement, risky enforcement, is subject to extensive negotiation and weakening.’

Financial penalties meted out by the SEC were ‘at most a tollbooth on the bankster turnpike’, he said, according to Bloomberg News.

He added: ‘I have had bosses, and bosses of my bosses, whose names we all know, who made little secret that they were here to punch their ticket. They mouthed serious regard for the mission of the commission, but their actions were tentative and fearful in many instances.’

One of the SEC’s most headline-grabbing cases post-credit crisis was against Goldman Sachs, which paid $550million in July 2010 to settle claims it had committed fraud in a complicated transaction involving securities known as collateralised debt obligations.

The scheme’s principal architect, Fabrice Tourre, was also sued by the SEC, which said he epitomised 'Wall Street greed’ during his trial last year.
