Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams may be handed a giant tax bill after a U.S. businessman paid around £25,000 so he could have an operation in an exclusive private American hospital.

The controversial politician allowed prominent Irish-American businessman Bill Flynn to pick up the tab for a prostate procedure in New York last November.

Mr Adams says the procedure had not 'cost the taxpayer a penny' and was paid for by a man he described as a 'very very good friend'.

The member of the Irish parliament for Louth/East Meath, which is on the border with Northern Ireland, said the operation had freed him from five years of 'constant pain'.

Bill Flynn, who was former chief of life insurance giant Mutual of America, is a close friend and agreed to cover the cost as Mr Adams had 'financial problems' linked to a second property.

Today questions have been raised about whether he will be able to use an Irish gift tax exemption, which allows people to write off certain medical costs if it is given as a present.

But crucially the gift has to be from someone based in Ireland and as Mr Flynn is often based in America, the exemption may not apply.

'Mr Adams is consulting with his tax advisers as to whether any taxation
arises from this medical procedure', a Sinn Féin spokesman said, adding: 'if he owes tax then of course he will pay it'.

'He did not get this just because he was a member of parliament, it was a close personal friend who paid for it.

'It could not be done in Ireland at that time'.

The Sinn Féin president said last week there was a 'fixation' within the media 'on the state of [his] health'.

He told RTÉ Radio One's Marian Finucane show: 'I have had a longstanding and very very painful complaint. And as you know I go back and forth to the States once or twice a year. One of my friends introduced me to…his doctor. And he recommended that I should have a process of a particular kind.

'I have been in constant pain for the last five years and at that time, the treatment of this kind was not available in the North.'

Marian Finucane explained that such an operation cost in the region of $30,000 and it was difficult to explain how Mr Adams might have that money.

He said: 'Well, I didn't pay for it … a very very good friend of mine, a man called Bill Flynn, very kindly paid for it… I couldn't have afforded it. My wife and my family are eternally grateful to him.'

Mr Adams also insisted that having private medical treatment was in line with his party's policies, which is anti-private healthcare.

He said: 'Sinn Féin's position, and it remains my position, is for a universal healthcare, a public health service of the very highest standard available to all citizens.'
