Rolando Aarons should have been Newcastle’s hero when he came from the bench to score and set up one against Crystal Palace, only for Wilfried Zaha to spoil the party. Craig Hope brings you more...

Where did he sign from?

After leaving Jamaica as a child he joined Bristol City before Newcastle signed him at 16. He’s shone for the reserves and in his time with the senior side.

What type of player?

His first senior goal on Saturday was a towering header — but Duncan Ferguson he is not! He’s a box of tricks with a turn of foot and plays without fear.

How good can he be?

He won his first England Under 20 call-up last week and will choose the Three Lions over Jamaica. 

He’s only 18 but his is a name we’ll be hearing a lot more.

Remind you of anyone?

There is a bit of Zaha about him, and Raheem Sterling, too. Alan Pardew has likened him to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.
