Countryside campaigners will target MPs at the next election, demanding that they back reforms to planning laws.

They say measures brought in by the Government will allow the greenbelt to be destroyed and threaten thousands of acres of rural land.

The Campaign to Protect Rural England will ask every Conservative, Labour or Liberal Democrat candidate to sign a charter to save the English countryside.

Sir Andrew Motion, the former Poet Laureat, is president of CPRE, and has named the planning minister 'Boles the Builder'

Sir Andrew Motion, president of the CPRE, yesterday came close to saying his group’s 70,000 supporters should vote Labour  – which has vowed to tear up the Coalition’s planning policy rules, unless Tories and Lib Dems change their minds.

Sir Andrew, the former Poet Laureate, said he would demand that all three parties’ manifestos included changes to planning policy.

He said that otherwise ‘that will be England gone’.

The charity yesterday issued a charter, ‘Save Our Countryside’, calling for brownfield land to be built on before greenfield, more say for communities in planning decisions and a focus on better-designed, ‘sensitively located’ affordable homes.

CPRE chief executive Shaun Spiers said David Cameron is ‘in denial’ about the effect of his Government’s planning changes on the countryside.

He said the CPRE would join the National Trust and other campaigners to press for reform, adding: ‘We will be seeking as many meetings with prospective Parliamentary candidates as possible, asking them to commit to the principles in the charter.’

The dramatic intervention will make the countryside a central feature of the general election in 2015, just as candidates were pressured to oppose university tuition fee rises in 2010.

As a charity, the CPRE cannot endorse political candidates, but its army of supporters could well hit the streets for those who share their views. Sir Andrew said: ‘We want to use our charter to influence the general election manifestos of all parties.’

The National Planning Policy Framework, introduced this year, says councils must promote ‘sustainable development’ in planning decisions. Critics say it weakens protections against building on greenfield land.

Asked if the CPRE would tell members to vote Labour because of its pledge to reform the NPPF, Sir Andrew said: ‘Vote for the right policies is the right answer. '

It certainly does need reforming and 
if the Labour party is the only party which does do the reforming, 
people can make their own deductions from that.’

He added: ‘The countryside is not something we can afford to take or leave. It is irreplaceable. 
‘We made it together over many centuries, it is our great communal 
masterpiece, the greatest thing we have ever made as a nation . . . Once
we have ruined it we can’t “un-ruin” it.’

Calling the situation an ‘emergency’, Sir Andrew added: ‘That will be England gone. That is why we need this charter.

‘We want [ministers] to see that the NPPF is not working despite what seem to be its original good intentions.’

Mr Spiers is seeking talks with David Cameron, who holds the rural Oxfordshire seat of Witney.

He said: ‘A lot of development is 
planned for the future on greenfield sites. We think the Government is 
in denial about the consequences of its policies.

‘I think in particular the Prime Minister is in denial about what is happening on the ground – and about rising anger.

‘We’re working on all three party manifestos.

'The CPRE is a charity and we’re 
careful to avoid any hint of being party political but I hope the Prime 
Minister in particular – who I believe does genuinely care about the 
countryside – will take notice.
