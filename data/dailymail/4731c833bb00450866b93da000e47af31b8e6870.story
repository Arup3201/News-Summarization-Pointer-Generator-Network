New York City police officers shed tears today at a memorial for the two murdered at the site in Brooklyn where they were shot dead.

Uniformed cops laid bouquets, lit candles and left toys around the street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of the city where a crazed gunamn shot dead officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu.

They were joined by mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife, who also laid flowers at the site in a show of unity with the police force, elements of which say the mayor had turned against them before the deaths.

De Blasio later led city officials in a moment of silence at 2.47pm Monday - exactly three days after Ismaaiyl Brinsley opened fire on officers Ramos and Liu as they sat in their patrol car.

Guest: Mayor Bill de Blasio - who has faced criticism from some officers - came to the memorial with his wife Chirlane McCray. The pair laid flowers and later led a moment of silence

Officers amassed at the memorial fell silent to honor their fallen comrades, as city leaders urged people around New York and the country to do the same.

Mayor de Blasio told a press conference at City Hall: 'I want o ask everyone who is assembled here, and everyone who is watching to now bow our heads in memory of Officer Ramos and Officer Liu'. 

He then paused for around a minute and embraced his wife Chirlane McCray - then told others to do the same as a symbol of their communal grief.

Today at the memorial, near the Myrtle/Willoughby subway stations on the G line, NYPD Lieutenant Tanisha Gurley was one of those mourning the two men.

As she knelt in front of the memorial a single tear could be seen running down her cheek. Other officers were pictured embracing, while sobbing members of the public also paid their respects.

Silence: Mayor Bill de Blasio bowed his head in City hall - and urged others to do the same - at 2.47pm, the time the officers were shot

Paying respects: At the memorial in Brooklyn, officers bowed their heads and paused as well

Grieving: The silence coincided with a message from NYPD commissioner Bill Bratton praising the two fallen officers

Details of a full funeral for officer Ramos - a regular church-goer who aspired to be a full-time minister - were announced, with a service in Queens set for December 27. Last night NYPD officials said arrangements for Liu's funeral would follow after relatives had been flown in from China.

Earlier that day NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton posted a message honoring the fallen officers, and said the department will keep its flags at half-mast until after Christmas.

He described Liu and Ramos as: 'loving fathers, husbands, and sons—points of great pride for their communities.

'They were also part of our NYPD family, bonded by the experiences, triumphs, and challenges we face so that others won’t have to. They dedicated their lives to the defense of others, and understood what that commitment could ultimately mean.

'They were people of faith, of conviction, and of principle. They answered the call to service, and did so each and every day they wore the uniform. They were devoted to the protection of this city and the safety of its people.

'They didn’t do this work to be thanked, congratulated, or admired. They did it because it must be done, because we all have the basic right to live free from fear. And with all of us, they stood tall to guard those who cannot guard themselves, to shield the frightened, the weak, and the vulnerable.

'We are their memory. We are their legacy. And we still stand.
