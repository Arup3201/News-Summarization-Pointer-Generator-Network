Ten thousand people who had their housing benefit capped have either moved into work or stopped claiming it entirely, new figures show.

Officials said the latest figures on impact of the government’s welfare reforms showed they were clearly encouraging people to return to work.

In more than 7,370 households where the benefit cap was applied someone has now found a job - a rate of 500 people a month since the policy was introduced.

Progress? Figures show people in almost 8,000 households affected by the benefits cap have now got a job

An additional 2,320 households no longer claim housing benefit at all – potentially because they were earning enough not to need it anymore.

Since a cap of £26,000 a year was imposed last April – the income of the average working family in Britain – 46,000 households have had their benefits brought under this level.

The Department for Work and Pensions said the latest figures out yesterday showed the ballooning benefits bill is being brought under control.

The figures also show that without the benefit cap, more than 2,000 households would have each received over £10,000 a year more than the threshold now allowed.

'Cuts are working': Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the figures show the benefits cap and the cuts imposed are working

Iain Duncan Smith, said: ‘By capping benefits we are putting a stop to these runaway benefit claims and returning fairness to the system.

‘This Government is fixing the broken welfare system we inherited, ensuring that it always pays more to be in work, and thereby encouraging thousands of people to move off benefits and into jobs.’

The £26,000 cap works out as a maximum of £500 a week for couples with or without children or lone parents. It is less - just £350 a week - for a single adult.

It applies to a household’s combined income for out-of-work benefits, housing, child benefit and carers’ allowance, but some families with disabled people are exempt from it.

Labour have promised to be tough on welfare dependency but voted against the benefits cap, and to keep increases in benefits at 1pc per year.

Rachel Reeves the shadow work and pensions secretary said last month that the number of people claiming housing benefit who are in work will double to nearly a million this year compared with 2009. 

She claims the way to bring this down is by increasing the minimum wage and making work contracts more secure.

According to a poll by Ipsos Mori in April this year, nearly half of benefit claimants hit by the cap on welfare payments said they were doing more to find work than before.

And despite predictions by critics that it would cause misery – it found 45pc of those affected said they had felt spurred to get a job. Many had sent off more applications or were using agencies or careers centres to help them find employment.

Capping benefits is intended to save £185million over four years. But the DWP say it is also about the principle of rewarding hard work and ‘restoring fairness to the welfare system’.
