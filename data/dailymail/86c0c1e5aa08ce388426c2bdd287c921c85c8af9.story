Pension packet:  MoD accounts reveal that Sir David Richards has stashed away a retirement fund of £4million, the largest ever for a civil servant

When General Sir David Richards retired as Armed Forces chief two years ago, he confessed to a modest ambition to indulge his passion for sailing if he could earn enough.

However, I can disclose that the canny old soldier has a pension pot so huge that he could buy an oligarch’s yacht.

Buried deep in the Ministry of Defence’s latest accounts is the startling fact that Richards has amassed a retirement hoard worth £4 million.

It is thought to be the largest sum ever racked up by a public servant and is likely to raise eyebrows at a time when the Army has been forced to sell off its crown jewels such as the Old War Office in an effort to raise money.

The pot, which stood at £3.99 million last March, includes a lump sum payout of up to £445,000.

The accounts state that he receives a gold-plated annual pension as high as £150,000 before tax. However, a source says that due to Coalition tax changes, his pension will now be £117,107. 

Before he retired, Richards earned a salary as high as £240,000 as Chief of the Defence Staff and lived with his wife Caroline in a grace-and-favour apartment at Kensington Palace, home to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Richards, 62, also received perks worth almost £100,000 relating to the cost of his official residence and travel. As part of this, the Goverment paid the estimated £28,572 tax bill on the benefits.

Elevated to the House of Lords last year, he can now take advantage of a £300 tax-free allowance each day he attends Parliament, as well as enjoying the income from any company directorships he chooses to take on.

Since his retirement, he has worked as an adviser to the International Institute for Strategic Studies and has made a number of corporate appearances with a company called Military Speakers.

The disclosure comes after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warned that the MoD may have to ‘sweat its assets’, selling off yet more land and barracks.

But could the lavish deal given to Richards be the last of its kind? Shadow Defence Secretary Vernon Coaker has announced that he plans a root-and-branch review of MoD perks if the Labour Party wins May’s General Election.

An MoD spokesman says the £4 million figure is an ‘estimate of the increased overall value’ of his pension. ‘This is in line with Cabinet Office guidelines and other public sector final salary schemes.’

Middleton brother tells tycoons: Here's how to tie a bow tie

His sister the Duchess of Cambridge is hailed as a fashion icon and now James Middleton is determined to give us his own style tips.

The bearded former Marlborough College pupil has recorded a video for The Young Director, a magazine for budding entrepreneurs, teaching them how to fasten their bow ties.

Shunning a vulgar clip-on dickie bow, the 27-year-old Edinburgh University dropout talks his socially ambitious viewers through the stages of tying a knot. 

He then poses in a range of evening jackets, displaying his artfully mismatched socks.

Perhaps he should spend less time fiddling with his outfits and more time on his business. 

This month, he was forced to admit his cake-baking firm had racked up losses for the third consecutive year.

He complains to the interviewer that ‘it does get frustrating’ that his efforts are overshadowed by Kate. ‘I work incredibly hard,’ he says. 

‘Aside from the fact of — yes, I am the brother of someone very important — I am, at the end of the day, just James.’

Hollywood heart-throb Leonardo DiCaprio should portray him in a film, he adds. ‘The guy is a genius and he would make me look fantastic.’ 

And James’s girlfriend, Byker Grove actress Donna Air, could play herself.

Selfie obsession

Virgin tycoon Sir Richard Branson likes to paint himself as a rebel, but his son Sam is proud of the family’s establishment credentials.

The one-time Burberry model (right) posed in the judge’s wig worn by his great-grandfather Sir George Branson (left) and posted the picture online.

No doubt the Cambridge-educated High Court judge, privy counsellor and esteemed author would have been unimpressed, though, by Sam’s caption, which failed to use an apostrophe.

‘My great grandfathers [sic] wig as a high court judge,’ wrote privately educated Sam, 29. ‘Amazing to think how his brain worked in this.’
