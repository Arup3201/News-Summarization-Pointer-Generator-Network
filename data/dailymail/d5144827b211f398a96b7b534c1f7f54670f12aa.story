Vladamir Putin has said he is confident he will win tomorrow’s presidential election, claiming yesterday that his 12 years in power have been good for Russia.

Recent allegations of vote-rigging led to mass demonstrations in Moscow in the largest show of anti-government discontent since the Soviet collapse two decades ago.

But the prime minister insisted that although he has less support in big cities, he is favoured by a majority of Russians.

He said: ‘Yes, there is a smaller number of my supporters there, but they are still a majority.’

That claim is in line with recent 
opinion polls that show he is backed by about 60  per cent of voters, 
paving the way for an easy victory against his four Kremlin-approved 
contenders.

Mr Putin said his 12-year rule had been a ‘good experience for Russia’.

He said: ‘That situation has helped 
make government structures more capable, has raised the need for them to
think, search for solutions and communicate with society.’

Mr Putin also reaffirmed his promise,
if he wins tomorrow’s vote, to name his protege, current president 
Dmitry Medvedev, as prime minister.

Putin insisted Friday that he and Medvedev made their decision because Putin is the more popular of the two.

Putin reaffirmed his promise to name Medvedev as the prime minister, if he wins Sunday’s vote, saying the premiership would allow Medvedev to implement reforms he has announced.

Some observers said, however, that appointing Medvedev could help Putin avoid a wave of discontent that will likely be fueled by planned painful economic and social reforms.

Putin’s popularity has been dented by opposition protests, but he has managed to recoup the losses thanks to massive daily coverage by state television that cast him as the defender of nationalist interests against foreign expansion and the protector of economic and social stability.

He has accused the U.S. of instigating the opposition protests to weaken Russia and strongly criticized plans for the U.S.-led NATO missile defense around Europe.

Putin insisted Friday that the planned shield would target Russia’s nuclear deterrent and undermine global stability, adding that Washington’s refusal to offer Moscow written guarantees that its missile defense system will not be aimed against Russia deepened its concerns.

'When one party gets an illusion that it’s invulnerable for a retaliatory strike by another, that stokes up conflicts and aggressive behavior,' Putin said. 'We consider that extremely dangerous.'

He said President Barack Obama’s policy of “resetting” ties with Russia has helped reach the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty and successfully negotiate Russia’s access into the World Trade Organization, but has brought 'practically nothing' on the divisive missile defense issue.

At the same time, he praised Obama as 'absolutely sincere' in his course of improving ties with Russia.
