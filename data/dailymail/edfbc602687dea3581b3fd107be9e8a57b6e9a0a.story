A husband has been jailed for life after strangling his wife in a 'cruel and merciless' attack because he wanted to 'shut her up'.

Mark Dyson, 55, killed his wife Carole, who had cared for him for more than 25 years, before walking to a nearby hospital and confessing that 'something terrible' had happened.

His constant moaning left both of them at the end of their tether and he eventually snapped when his wife refused to wait for him to get up when the couple were due to go out, Liverpool Crown Court heard. 

Mark Dyson, 55, killed his wife Carole, 53, because he wanted to 'shut her up'. Mrs Dyson, who had cared for her husband for more than 25 years, was murdered in a 'cruel and merciless' attack, a judge said

Judge Mr Justice Holroyde said the terror, pain and anguish suffered by Mrs Dyson, 53, during the attack was too 'terrible to contemplate' - and that she stood no chance against his 'murderous attack'.

After killing his wife, Dyson walked to nearby Chorley Hospital and told staff 'something terrible' had happened.

Admitting the murder to police officers, he said he had 'wanted to shut her up'. 

Mr Justice Holroyde said: 'You did so by cruel and merciless strangulation.

'You are bigger and heavier than her, she stood no chance of defending herself against your murderous attack, which was plainly intended to kill her.'

Officers forced their way into the couple's home in Adlington,  Lancashire, on April 29 and found the lifeless body of Mrs Dyson lying on a bed.

The judge said it was estimated that Dyson applied pressure to her throat for 30 to 60 seconds or more.

Dyson had suffered from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder caused by the death of the couple's 15-year-old daughter, the court was told.

He also had a rare condition which caused him to believe he was in constant pain.

He said he had been in pain for some time and his wife had been 'nasty' to him.

After the sentencing on Wednesday, Det Insp John Roy, of Lancashire Constabulary's Major Investigation Team, said: 'I welcome the fact that Mark Dyson has admitted the murder of his wife, which has at least spared the family the pain of a trial.

'This is a tragic case and our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Carole Dyson.'

At the time of the murder, neighbours in the quiet residential street where the couple lived expressed their shock at the death of Mrs Dyson.

Audra Ashton, 47, who left flowers at their house, said: 'To me, she was a lovely woman, absolutely fantastic.

'She had pride in her house and was always out cleaning the windows and cleaning the door.'

Dyson was given a life sentence and will serve at least 14 years before he is eligible to apply for parole.
