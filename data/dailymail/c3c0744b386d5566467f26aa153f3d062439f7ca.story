Ravel Morrison has returned to West Ham United training after having his loan spell at Cardiff City cut short.

The former Manchester United midfielder was originally due to stay with the Championship side until Boxing Day but he is already back training at the Hammers.

It is unclear whether or not Morrison has a first-team future at Upton Park, but he posted a picture on his Instagram showing himself in the West Ham gym on Sunday.

The midfielder has been at West Ham for two-and-a-half years and scored this great solo goal against Spurs

Age: 21

Born: Wythenshawe, Manchester

Position: Midfielder

Clubs: Manchester United (2010-12), West Ham United (2012-), Birmingham City (loan, 2012-13), Queens Park Rangers (loan, 2014), Cardiff City (loan, 2014)

Career appearances: 80

Career goals: 14 

The 21-year-old was also wearing his official Hammers training kit while lying on a training mat in the photo.

During his two-and-a-half months in the Welsh capital, Morrison made just six appearances and failed to find the target for Cardiff.

Morrison has persistently struggled with off-field disciplinary problems throughout his career, including making homophobic remarks on Twitter and being arrested - and subsequently cleared - on suspicion of assaulting his ex-girlfriend and her mother.

He has been at Upton Park for two-and-a-half seasons but he has already been loaned out to Birmingham City, Queens Park Rangers and Cardiff during that time.

West Ham are flying in the Premier League and sit fourth, meaning it will be difficult for Morrison to force his way back into manager Sam Allardyce's first-team plans.
