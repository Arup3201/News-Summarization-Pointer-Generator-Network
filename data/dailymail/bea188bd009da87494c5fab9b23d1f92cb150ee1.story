Doctors are warning that an antibiotic-resistant strain of gonorrhoea, now considered a superbug, has the potential to be as deadly as the AIDS virus.

Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported sexually transmitted infection in North America. 

This particular strain of gonorrhea, known as HO41, was discovered in Japan two years ago in a 31-year-old female sex worker who had been screened in 2009. The bacteria has since been found in Hawaii, California and Norway.

In a bid to avoid contracting gonorrhea, in particular the HO41 strain, people are encouraged to practice safe sex

HO41 has so far proved resistant to current antibiotic treatment and so it has been placed in the superbug category.

‘This might be a lot worse than AIDS in the short run because the bacteria is more aggressive and will affect more people quickly,’ Alan Christianson, a doctor of naturopathic medicine told CNBC.

Nearly 30 million people have died from AIDS related causes worldwide, but Christianson believes the effect of the gonorrhea bacteria is more direct. 

‘Getting gonorrhea from this strain might put someone into septic shock and death in a matter of days,’ Christianson said. ‘This is very dangerous.’ 

In a briefing on Capitol Hill last 
week, William Smith, executive director of the National Coalition for 
STD Directors, urged Congress to target nearly $54 million in immediate 
funding to help find an antibiotic for HO41 and to conduct an education 
and public awareness campaign.

Although no deaths from HO41 have been reported as yet, experts say avoiding the disease completely is the best course of action.

‘People
need to practice safe sex, like always,’ Christianson said. ‘Anyone 
beginning a new relationship should get tested along with their partner.

'The way gonorrhea 
works, not everyone knows they have it. And with this new strain it's 
even more important than ever to find out.’

Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease that has been known since medieval times. Sometimes known as ‘the clap,’ the infection can result in painful sores and genital discharge, and is associated with ectopic pregnancies and sterility in both men and women.

Left untreated, gonorrhea can lead to a 
host of complications including pelvic inflammatory disease, 
infertility, and blood stream infections.

It also raises the risk for HIV because the lesions permit the AIDS-causing virus easier access to the bloodstream.

Gonorrhea is especially common among people between the ages of 15 and 24.

The
disease became curable in the 1940s when penicillin and other 
antibiotics were introduced. Since then, the medical world has created 
more new drugs that killed the ever-mutating gonorrhea bacteria.

On
a state-by-state basis, pockets of the U.S. are seeing giant spikes in 
the disease. Utah saw a 74 percent rise in gonorrhea cases in 2012, with
the trend continuing into the first few months of this year.

In
Minnesota, cases rose 35 percent in 2012, according to the state's 
department of health, and according to the latest statistics from the 
CDC, ‘During 2010–2011, 61% (31/51) of states, plus the District of 
Columbia, reported an increase in gonorrhea rates.’

Cephalosporin, the last available class of antibiotics recommended for the treatment of gonorrhea, has been failing worldwide and there is the very real prospect that all types of gonorrhea will soon become untreatable.

Professor Cathy Ison, head of the National Reference Laboratory for Gonorrhoea in the U.K. told the BBC
last week: ‘There is a possibility that if we don't do something then it could become untreatable by 2015.’
