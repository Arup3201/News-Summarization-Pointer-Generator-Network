Like many teenagers, Tori has bad habits - but the 15-year-old orangutan's involve a nicotine addiction which has forced zookeepers to make her go cold turkey.

The teenage primate has been smoking for a decade, having learned the habit by mimicking human behaviour and then puffing away on lit cigarettes which zoo visitors throw into her enclosure.

But 10 years on, officials at Satwa Taru Jurug zoo in Solo, Central Java, Indonesia, have finally allowed her to kick the habit by making moving the orangutan to a different area of the zoo to make her go cold turkey.

Puffing away: Tori the 156-year-old orangutan has been smoking for over a decade

Nicotine habit: Tori will be moved to a different section of the zoo to kick her habit, as visitors regularly throw her lit cogarettes

Taru Jurug Zoo director Lili Krisdianto said the move was aimed to protect four endangered orangutans at the 14-hectare (35-acre) zoo in the Central Java town of Solo.

The primate previously held cigarettes casually between her fingers while taking long drags and blowing bursts of smoke out her nostrils to the delight of visitors.

Hardi Baktiantoro of the Borneo-based Center for Orangutan Protection, which is helping to coordinate the intervention, said results of a medical test are expected Saturday to determine how much Tori's smoking has affected her health.

A mesh cover will initially be placed over Tori's cage, and later she will be moved to a small island away from the public, he said.

Several Indonesian zoos have come under scrutiny following animal deaths, including a giraffe that died in the long-troubled Surabaya Zoo in March with an 18-kilogram (40-pound) ball of plastic in its stomach after years of ingesting trash thrown into its enclosure by visitors.

Indonesia is also one of the last remaining countries where tobacco companies face few restrictions on selling, advertising and promoting products long banned elsewhere.

More than 60 percent of all men light up and a third of the country's entire population smokes.
