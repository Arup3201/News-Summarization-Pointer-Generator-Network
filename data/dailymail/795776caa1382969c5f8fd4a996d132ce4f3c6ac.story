Most British adults are convinced the world is getting worse because our happiest recollections are formed between the ages of 15 and 25, a new study has revealed.

Despite longer life expectancy, improved living conditions and better technology, 70 per cent of Brits believe the world is decline, with a further 55 per cent of people saying that their own lives are getting worse.

However, psychologists say that people's minds could be playing tricks on them by making them focus on current global dilemmas such as terrorism, war and negative events in their personal lives.

Psychologists say that as our happiest and strongest recollections are formed between the ages of 15 and 25, it distorts people's view of the present day (file picture) 

They add this is due to a 'memory bump' as our strongest recollections are between the ages of 15 and 25, which distorts out view of the present.

The survey was carried out for the BBC Radio Four series, The Human Zoo, which reports that by only remembering good things from the past, people fear that the future can only get worse.

Professor Nick Chater from Warwick Business School, who features on the new series, says many people look at the past through rose-tinted glasses.

He explained: 'The idea that everything is getting worse - declinism - is an old one, even ancient Athens saw itself as having declined from a former, mythical golden age.

'In particular our memory tends to forget about the bad events in our past and we have a tendency to rehearse and dwell on the good things that happened in the past.

'We retell them a lot more often, so we reinforce the good memories.

'We tend to remember the great songs or cars or football players from the "old days" and forget all the bad ones.'

As part of the survey, researchers carried out an experiment where they asked people to rate their holidays as they experienced them and then again several months later.

The study found that all the ratings were higher when the travellers recollected their experiences compared to what they said while on the holiday.

Professor Chater, who is also an advisor on behavioural change for the government, added: 'The key point is that people rate past holidays - and other experiences - as much more positive in retrospect than they do at the time.

'This is an illustration of the general idea that my life now doesn't seem as good as it will look in retrospect.

'This leads to status quo bias, which asserts that whatever the situation is now, things in the future will get worse.

'This plus loss aversion, combined with our memory's tendency to filter out bad experiences from the past, can leave us seeing the world, and our lives, as getting worse.'
