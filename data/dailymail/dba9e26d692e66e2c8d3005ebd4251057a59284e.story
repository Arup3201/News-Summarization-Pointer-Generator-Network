Paul Pogba struck a late goal to send Juventus 11 points clear at the top of Serie A as the Frenchman continues to show why he's one of Europe's most coveted midfielders.

Juve scraped past Sassuolo on Monday as the playmaker scored his seventh league goal of the campaign and gave them a clear lead over nearest rivals Roma with 12 games left to play. 

The papers in Italy were keen to praise Pogba after his match-winning performance with Corriere dello Sport saying: 'A moment of magic from the Frenchman defeats Sassuolo to unlock a difficult match and gift the victory.'

The midfielder's love-in continued as his picture dominated the front of the Italian pages and Tuttosport joined Corriere in praising his goal, 'A moment of magic from Pogba defeats Sassuolo.

'The Frenchman (who will miss the match against Palermo due to suspension) decides it with a great shot from outside the area.

'Finally Juve hit a winner on match point and Roma are further away.'

The Gazzetta dello Sport also led on Pogba but had an interesting line on former Juventus boss Antonio Conte's comments proclaiming, 'With me they'd be 20 points clear.'

While things for their European rivals going well, Real Madrid have come under scrutiny in recent weeks - with their heavily priced forward line feeling the brunt.

But Carlo Ancelotti has backed his stars and AS's headline states that Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema's first team places are 'non-negotiable.'

Marca included the quote from the Real Madrid boss but led on Luka Modric's imminent return to the first team saying, 'The Croatian will get half an hour against the Germans.'

With Barcelona finding their form and now top of La Liga, Mundo Deportivo called them 'The Perfect Leader,' and described them as 'the best of the teams that dominate the big European Leagues, with more points, more goals for, less conceded and the Pichichi (Marca's trophy awarded to the top goalscorer) are their arguments.
