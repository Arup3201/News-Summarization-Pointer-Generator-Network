George and Barbara Bush tied the knot on January 6, 1945, and celebrated their 69th wedding anniversary on Monday.

It’s a marriage that has endured longer than that of any U.S presidential first couple.

However, the occasion was celebrated in a low-key manner at their Houston home, as Mrs Bush, 88, had just been discharged from the city’s Methodist Hospital, having spent a week there being treated for pneumonia.

'They don’t think of it in terms of "we’re the longest,"' Jim McGrath, Mr Bush's spokesman told Fox News. 'They’re just so clearly still in love and devoted to one another. They’re two people, but they’re really one person.'

And the secret to their success? Mr McGrath says they treat each other with love and deference, as well as a lot of teasing.

“It’s hard for one to think of life without the other,” Mr Mgrath added. 'Which is why 69 years is such a blessing.'

When they first met, at a Christmas dance, Barbara was just 16 and George Herbert Walker Bush 17.

It was, reportedly, love at first sight.

They became engaged a year and a half later and married in Rye, New York, when the Second World War was in full swing.

George, now 89, was a pilot with a torpedo squadron in the Navy and flew 58 combat missions.

The ceremony took place just weeks after he returned from duty in the Pacific, following the surrender of the Japanese, and the future president wore his naval uniform for the occasion.

They had six children over the next 13 years, with one far more famous than the others: George Walker Bush came first, followed by Pauline Robinson 'Robin' Bush, who tragically died of leukemia in 1953 aged just four, John Ellis ‘Jeb’ Bush (born 1953), Neil Mallon Bush (born 1955), Marvin Pierce Bush (born 1956) and Dorothy Bush Koch (born 1959).

The marriage remained steady, but the location of the marital home certainly didn’t, with the couple moving a staggering 29 times over the years, according to First Lady Biography: Barbara Bush.

Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip aren’t far behind the Bushes, having been married for 66 years.
