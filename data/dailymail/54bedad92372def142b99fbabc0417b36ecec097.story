Derby City Council has spent £6,000 installing three bike pumps

A cash-strapped council has been slammed for spending £6,000 on just three bike pumps.

Derby City Council in the east Midlands, has come under fire from local residents  for splashing out on the 'ridiculous luxury.'

The pumps, which are made by Cyclehoop, of London, cost around £2,000 to buy and install.

Andy Silvester of the Tax Payers Alliance said: 'Taxpayers will be furious at this ridiculous waste of money. 

'At a time when Councils across the country are pleading poverty, it's ludicrous to waste quite so much cash on this scheme. 

'Those at the top of the Council need to sort out their priorities.' 

John Borthwick, 81, of Derby, said: 'When I was younger I used to race bikes and the very first thing you do is check your tyres.

'I think most people have bike pumps now and I really don't think they will be used that much.

'It's silly having them so close together as well. It should be moved further away, to the other side of town perhaps.

'And they certainly aren't worth £6,000 - you can buy a pump for a quid.'

The pumps have been placed outside Derby's Park Bikeworks and council offices and a third will be situated at the city's railway station

Barry Glover, 41, of Ilkeston, Derbyshire, said: 'Sometimes you wonder what planet these councillors are on. One minute they're moaning because the Government is slashing their cash and the next moment they are spending money on bike pumps.'

Ken Haswell, 38, from Derby, said: 'If the council had just made me redundant and then spent £6,000 on bike pumps I would be absolutely livid. It makes you think councils just can't be trusted with public money.'

'Mark Hirst, 59, from Alfreton, Derbyshire, said: 'I'm all for encouraging people to cycle but these pumps are a ridiculous luxury when the country is supposed to be broke. In an age when people have to learn to be more self-reliant, you would like to think that would include being able to pump up your own tyres.'

Derby resident reacted angrily to the decision with one branding the bike pumps a 'ridiculous luxury'

Derby City Councillor Asaf Afzal, cabinet member for Neighbourhoods and StreetPride, said: 'The council's cabinet has set aside around £6,000 from the Local Transport Plan to fund a series of public bike pumps.

'These provide assistance to cyclists suffering with flat or soft tyres.

'The pumps will fit varying types of valves and due to their high-volume capacity they can inflate tyres very quickly with little physical effort.

'The pumps are free to use by all cyclists.

'The pumps have been planned for key locations with high cycle usage.

'The first one was installed in the summer outside Park Bikeworks, the city centre free secure bike park and cycle hub on Full Street.

'A new pump was installed last week on the Morledge, near the Council House car park, which lies on the hub of the National Cycle Route network in Derby.

'A third pump is planned for installation in the New Year near the rail station bike park at the front of the station.

'In addition, a further pump has recently been installed near Mercian Cycles in Alvaston as part of the district centre improvements.

'This was funded through the council's capital regeneration budget.

'There are no further plans for bike pumps in Derby at this time but if successful, they will be considered as part of future transport and regeneration programmes where appropriate.'
