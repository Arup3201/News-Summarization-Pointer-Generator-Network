A homeless man has been charged with relieving himself on $1,000 worth of library books.

Benjamin Wilson is alleged to have been watched by a patron as he urinated on a stack of titles in a Florida library.

The 24-year-old entered Tavares Public Library at the weekend with the intention of using its free WiFi to download apps on to his tablet.

Staff quickly adjudged him to be behaving in an off manner, later telling police that they believed him to be either drunk or on drugs.

They claimed his eyes weren't reacting to changes in light and his speech was severely slurred.

Wilson was also said to have been 'having trouble standing and making a complete thought'.

He fell asleep on a chair inside the library, but a short time later collapsed over.

Once back on his feet, witnesses claim he stumbled around before coming to a halt.

Staff were then left dumbfounded when one patron told them he'd witnessed Wilson soil a collection of books.

Deputies from Lake County attended and found the accused  slurring and unable to stand up without support.

He was searched and found to be in possession of half a white pill, allegedly discovered tucked inside a green cigarette pack

Officers sent it to a specialist lab for testing, while Wilson himself was taken to jail.

A number of rental books were found to be wet.

Local news station My News 13 reported that he was charged with criminal mischief and disorderly intoxication.

It has yet to be established if the he is accused of deliberately relieving himself on the books or if it was an accident. 

The incident comes less than a month after another Florida man was accused of urinating on a woman from a nightclub balcony.

Food runner Orion Jones, 20, was said to have directed his stream towards a female coworker as he stood above her at Rick and Durty Harry's bar in Key West.

When he tried to run from police officers, he was tasered.
