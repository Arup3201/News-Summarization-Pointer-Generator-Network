A retired head-teacher has hit out at an animal rescue charity after they refused to let him adopt a dog because he was ‘too old’.

Don Evans had expressed his wish to take care of an abandoned lurcher earlier this month, but was shocked when Animal Lifeline charity in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, rejected him.

The charity claimed the 71-year-old MBE would not be able to offer a pet ‘at least ten years of active life’ due to his age.

'Disgusted': Don Evans was shocked when he was refused a dog by a local animal rescue charity and instead travelled to Wales to pick up 12-week-old puppy Bo

Yesterday Mr Evans, who was awarded the MBE for his services to the community, said he was not surprised the charity is unable to home their dogs, branding them ‘extremely rude’.

He said: I am disgusted by the way I was dealt with. They had the audacity to question my age.

‘I want to give a dog a good home and it's extremely rude to take that approach.'

Perfect breed: Mr Evans had expressed his wish to adopt a lurcher but his wish was denied

He added that a lurcher is exactly the breed he has been looking for, perfectly suited for his home which has a private garden and is located near fields.

Furious with his local animal charity, Mr Evans travelled to Wales where he picked up lurcher puppy Bo, but says he has complained bitterly to Animal Lifeline since.

'It's not surprising that they don't have homes for all of their dogs.’

Mr Evans, who lives in Longton, had 
offered to take in one of six lurchers which were dumped in a car in 
Leek, Staffordshire earlier this year.

He
called the charity and explained that he had plenty of time to care for
the dog since had had retired as a head teacher and school governor.

But
staff insisted Don did not fit their criteria and have since insisted 
they pride themselves on ‘giving a dog a home for life’.

Nick Fletcher, a spokesman for Animal Lifeline, yesterday defended the charity’s decision.

He said: ‘We have the bulk of our dogs 
from people whose circumstances have changed, died, relocated or, more 
commonly, they have had to move to rented accommodation which doesn't 
allow pets.

‘The reason we do get 
complaints is because people don't understand how we work and some 
people do get a little resentful to be told the type of dog they should 
have.’

Discriminated: The retired head teacher, holding a leaflet from Animal Lifeline, has complained to the charity over the refusal, calling their response to his adoption request 'extremely rude'

Refusal: The Animal Lifeline charity claimed Mr Evans would be unable to provide an active lifestyle for a lurcher dog

Pat Lawton, one of the charity's trustees, added: ‘Lurchers are very beautiful family dogs, but they are escape artists that are attracted to wildlife.

‘I tried to explain to Don that we have many wonderful dogs for him. However lurchers want at least ten years of active live.

‘The reason we didn't go ahead was because we pride ourselves on giving a dog a home for life.

‘The dog is chosen to suit the owner. I have to justify that dog's needs.’
