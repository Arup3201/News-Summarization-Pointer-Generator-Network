Under-fire England captain Mike Tindall was all smiles today as he  shrugged off the trials and tribulations of his team's World Cup campaign.

Following the narrow weekend defeat of Scotland, Tindall and Co. are now looking forward to taking on France in Saturday's World Cup quarter-final.

And sensibly, the boys were pictured with just glasses of water in front of them at their team hotel in Auckland this morning.

Martin Johnson's men have faced intense criticism during their campaign so far following a series of poor performances and controversial off-field antics.

Tindall, who is married to the Queen's granddaughter, Zara Phillips, has come in for the biggest battering. 

CCTV pictures of him flirting with a blonde on a night out with other players in Queenstown last month were released to the press causing a storm of outrage.

It has emerged today that the blonde may be an old flame whom he became close to during her time at Leeds University.

Tindall was forced to admit yesterday that he had lied about the amount of time he had spent with the woman on the night the footage was filmed.

While giving 100 per cent support for his captain and friend, Johnson did hold a team meeting to make the players 'fully aware of 
their responsibilities' and issued warnings about the need to take care 
with their conduct.

But it appears these warnings may have fallen on deaf ears after it emerged that three players had been forced to apologise to a Dunedin hotel worker.

England manager Martin Johnson said yesterday that he was 'angry' at James Haskell, Dylan Hartley and Chris Ashton for teasing a female hotel employee with lewd comments.

According to the Sunday Mirror, 
Annabel Newton, 23, said the three England players 'treated me with no 
respect' after she was called into a hotel room to retrieve her 
walkie-talkie.

Johnson said: 'I was angry with them. It is just the sort of thing we have talked about.

'What they thought was humour and a light-hearted exchange has clearly not been taken that way by Annabel, the girl involved.

'At the time they apologised when they realised they had stepped over the mark.'

The management realise the  punishing length of the tour necessitates a need to let off steam, there is now a clearly concerted move by the players to appear on good behaviour.

To that end, Tindall laughed and joked with team-mats Toby Flood, Tom Croft and Steve Thompson with water all round the order of the day.

Images of the team relaxing  emerged as a bouncer accused of illegally accessing the CCTV footage of Tindall on the controversial night out pleaded not guilty.

Jonathan Dixon, 40, appeared before Queenstown District Court in New Zealand today.

A plea of not guilty was entered and Dixon was remanded on continuing bail until October 17, a spokeswoman for the court said.

Dixon is charged with accessing a computer for dishonest purpose after footage showing the England centre flirting with the blonde at the Altitude bar were leaked to the press.

In a reversal of previous statements, Tindall yesterday admitted that he had lied about what happened next on the night the CCTV footage was filmed.

Reports emerged last week that he had then gone on to a second bar called Cowboys, where he was allegedly spotted with a blonde woman.

The claims were denied on September 24 
by media lawyer Julian Pike, of Farrer & Co, speaking on behalf of 
Tindall and his wife.

But 
yesterday public relations company Juniper Sport, which represents the 
player, said it could no longer stand by that denial and issued an 
apology on the player's behalf.

In
a statement given to the Mail On Sunday, the PR firm said: 'Mike 
Tindall gave his PR consultants and the Rugby Football Union his 
assurance that he had not attended the Cowboys bar, having left the 
Altitude bar.

'In good 
faith, his PR consultants, the RFU and the RFU's solicitors relied upon 
that assurance when dealing with last week's story.

'However, Mike now accepts that his recollection was incorrect and he apologises unreservedly for this misjudgment.'

The
weekend's revelations follow last week's 'ballgate' scandal, when 
England were found to have illegally switched balls in the game against 
Romania but avoided a potential points deduction after banning two 
members of Johnson's back-room team.
