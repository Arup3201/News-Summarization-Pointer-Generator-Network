A distraught husband has today demanded answers after discovering his wife of 29 years was buried in the WRONG grave, following a paperwork blunder.

Devastated Mark Bowley spotted the error when he visited wife Peta's final resting place to lay flowers on her grave.

Branding the mix-up a 'horrendous mistake', the 54-year-old said it was only when glancing at a nearby plot that he discovered the truth, seeing his wife's headstone adorning another grave.

Devastated: Mark Bowley discovered his wife had been buried in the wrong plot at Fleetwood Cemetery when he visited to lay flowers on her resting place. He spotted her headstone adorning a different plot

Following Mrs Bowley's death on April 1, aged 52, her husband was told the family had been allocated grave number 67 at Fleetwood Cemetery in Lancashire.

But, instead, the mother-of-three was laid to rest in plot 87 - the row in front of her intended final resting place, and the grave at which her grieving husband has been paying his respects for six months.

The headstone was erected by Wyre Memorials on October 17, at plot 67 - following instructions given to them by Wyre Council, which operates the cemetery.

Mr Bowley, from Thornton, said: 'It is an horrendous mistake that has devastated the family.

'On top of losing someone we love we are having to deal with this too.'

Dignified: Peta Bowley died in April, two years to the day after the mother-of-three was diagnosed with cancer

Mrs Bowley, who worked for the family’s fish merchant business, died in April two years to the day after being diagnosed with cancer.

Her husband added: 'I’d gone to the grave to make sure the flowers were OK, and I was looking around thinking the grass was getting a bit long.

'I just happened to notice Peta’s headstone had been installed on the wrong grave. I was devastated and couldn’t believe it.'

As soon as the mistake was spotted the headstone was moved to the plot where Mrs Bowley was actually buried.

Council bosses have since apologised to Mr Bowley, who was married for 29 years.

They insisted it was an administration error and he had not been visiting an empty grave for the last six months.

Mr Bowley added: 'My wife was very dignified and fought the disease, which started as breast cancer and unfortunately went on to be a brain tumour.

'I know she will be looking down on us now and smiling - she’ll be having a giggle about this.

'But I don’t want anyone else to suffer like we have done.

'I want to get to the bottom of exactly how this happened, and I have questions that I need answering.

'I want to know how this happened in the first place.'

Apology: Wyre Council apologised for the paperwork blunder. Mr Bowley praised Wyre Memorials, who placed the headstone, under instruction from the council, for acting to move it immediately

Mr Bowley praised the response of Wyre Memorials for acting so quickly to rectify the mistake.

He said: 'I was told that the last 30 years they had never come across this before.

'Wyre Memorials is in no way to blame for what happened. They literally went off the plans drawn up by the council.'

John Wilson, owner of Wyre Memorials, of Fleetwood, said: 'I cannot imagine what that gentleman went through. To lose a wife at such an early age is so distressing.

'The realisation of seeing your wife’s name on a headstone is bad enough.

'As soon as we found out I straight away came to Fleetwood and we rectified things immediately.'

A spokesman for Wyre Council said: 'The family has been correctly visiting the plot she was buried in, so there is no question of them paying their respects to an empty grave.

'A problem only occurred when the headstone was placed on the original plot because the paperwork was wrong.

'For this we hold our hands up and apologise but the stone was moved as soon as the mistake came to light and it was only in the wrong place for a few hours.

'We have always considered that grave to belong to Mrs Bowley and the correct paperwork has now been issued.

'As a result of the error, Wyre Council has changed working practices within bereavement services to prevent this happening again.'
