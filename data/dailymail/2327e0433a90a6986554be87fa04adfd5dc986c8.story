Morgan Schneiderlin's performances have been so good this season they prove he could play for any side in the Premier League, Gary Neville has claimed.

The France international was again impressive as Southampton beat Manchester United 1-0 at Old Trafford thanks to a second-half goal from summer signing Dusan Tadic.

Schneiderlin was courted by both Tottenham and Arsenal during the summer and Neville believes the 25-year-old would be more than capable of holding his own at any of England's top clubs.

Speaking on Sky Sports, Neville said: 'I think he could play at any of the top clubs in the league, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United or Arsenal - he's showed his quality this season. 

‘You look at Schneiderlin and Fonte today, there was no sweat on them. They're composed and organised.'

The victory was Southampton's first at Old Trafford in the Premier League era (they last won there in January 1988), but for Schneiderlin the most important factor was that the south coast side are putting a decent run together.

He said: ‘To be honest, I didn't know that Southampton have never won at Old Trafford (in the Premier League).

‘Today we showed good resilience and great character. We had one opportunity and we scored.

‘We went through a very tough patch in December but we showed good team spirit and this result is a reward for the work we have put it.'
