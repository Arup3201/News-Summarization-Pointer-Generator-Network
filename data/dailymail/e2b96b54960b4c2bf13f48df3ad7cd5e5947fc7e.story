The billionaire founder of Phones 4U has been given permission to create a £250million 'mega mansion' with an enormous underground extension to his two linked mansions.

John Caudwell - who is worth an estimated £1.5billion - has been given the go-ahead to build a 14,000sq ft 'iceberg' extension to his back-to-back Mayfair properties.

The two separate homes are already linked underground but the 61-year-old tycoon will put a swimming pool, sauna, salon, bar, games room and car park in the vast new extension.

Tycoon: John Caudwell, pictured left with his partner Clare Johnson, was the co-founder of Phones 4U and sold his stake in the company for £1.5billion in 2006

Mr Caudwell, who sold his mobile 
phone company in 2006, is a philanthropist and has said he is giving the
 two properties a massive extension to increase their value and make a 
fortune for charity when he dies.

The underground bunker will be about 180ft long, stretching 
under each house and joining them beneath their gardens, which back on 
to each other in Mayfair.

The
 result will be a massive single property of some 50,000 sq ft – a 
normal town house is about 4,500 to 8,000 sq ft, while other mansions in
 Mayfair are from 10,000 sq ft. The ‘iceberg’ extension alone will cover
 14,000 sq ft.

Once 
complete, the mega-mansion will have 12 bedrooms – there are five in 
each house already and the plans include two more in the underground 
extension.

Extension: The new lower ground floor will feature a games room, kitchen, pool, sauna, changing room, media room, plant room and a car lift

With property prices for super-prime homes in Mayfair at around £5,000 per sq ft, the finished home could be worth £250million.

Following a Westminster Council planning meeting on Tuesday night, Mr Caudwell was given permission to carry out the work.

He
 said: 'I'm obviously delighted that the application has been 
successful. This now presents me with the opportunity to create a 
balanced and logically laid-out family home whilst restoring the 
architectural heritage of the building and also incorporating modern-day
 features and facilities.'

In the 1960s it was a members club and, according to its history, was frequented by ‘dubious  gangland characters’, footballers and celebrities. It was bought  by Prince Jefri, brother of the Sultan of Brunei, in 1992 for a reported £18million.

He spent millions decorating it and sold  it to an investment group a  decade later.

Mr Caudwell grew up in a working-class background in Stoke-on-Trent and was a second-hand car dealer before forming Phones4u, which he sold in 2006 for £1.5billion. He is thought to be Britain’s highest income-tax payer, personally contributing more than £200million over the past five years.

The annual number of iceberg 
extension applications in Westminster has more than doubled from 79 in 
2008/09 to 181 in 2011/12 and local government chiefs are planning a crackdown from next year.

Robert Davis, Conservative deputy leader of Westminster City Council, said: 'The
 council has to make planning decisions based on its current policies, 
and we are now consulting on changes to strengthen those policies to 
manage large basements developments in the city.

'The
 planning structure nationally means that this will take time, but 
residents have asked us to tackle this issue and that is exactly what we
 are doing.'
