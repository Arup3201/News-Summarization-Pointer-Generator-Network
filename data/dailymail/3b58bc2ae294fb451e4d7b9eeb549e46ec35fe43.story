A Chicago judge's computer was used to access 243 separate hardcore porn websites, it was revealed today.

Someone using Associate Judge Joseph Polito's  computer login and password attempted to log on to adult websites including hugeheavybreasts.com and chubbyparade.com.

The judge has refused to say whether it was him that was using the computer at the time.

Porn: An attempt was made to access adult content from the judge's computer account. It is unclear who did it

Other porn sites that the user attempted to get onto included bigbras-club.com, portofdebauchery.com and teenagesextape.com.

The other sites someone tried to access suggested an interest in masturbation and large-breasted women, theÂ Chicago Sun-Times reported.

Other websites refer to older women and office sex.

Chief Judge Gerald R Kinney has apologised 'for any embarrassment this incident has caused'.

None of the attempts to visit adult websites were successful because of filters.

Judge Politico - who has refused to comment on the incident - could be suspended or sacked after the case was referred to the Illinois Judicial Inquiry Board.

He has been an associate judge since 2006 and was involved in small claims cases, car cases and forfeiture hearings on the five days when the computer was used to access porn.

He is now involved in divorce cases. At the time he would have had a computer on his bench in the courtroom.

The attempts to access adult websites only came to light in Illinois after a freedom of information request was submitted.

All websites staff access are tracked to prevent workers from wasting taxpayers' money on sites not connected to their jobs.

Many webpages - such as Facebook and shopping sites - are automatically blocked.

Judge Polito was put in charge of a 
high-profile divorce case in 2007 involving Plainfield man Craig Stebic 
who was attempting to split from his missing wife Lisa.

An investigation into the computer use on Polito's account was launched after the freedom of information request was submitted by the Chicago Sun-Times.

Initially Chief Judge Kinney refused to release the records - and said that the data was a 'judicial record' and exempt from disclosure.

However, the documents were eventually made public after the Illinois Attorney-General said that the list of porn sites was 'unrelated to any judicial function [and] is not a judicial record.'

The data released covered a six month period around the end of 2010.

From Polito's computer account there were attempts to view pornography on five separate days.
