Piers Morgan flashed his cash on Twitter on Thursday evening, by offering Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany '£60 million and 2 Ferrari's' to go and play for Arsenal.

Morgan, a lifetime supporter of the Gunners, was turned down by the Belgian, who insisted he 'plays for glory'. 

The conversation began when Kompany tweeted, 'OMG Anderlecht' after the Belgian champions came back from 3-0 down to grab a last-gasp 3-3 draw with Arsenal.

Kompany, as he later tweeted, spent 14 years playing for Anderlecht, and after celebrating their goal was told to 'pipe down' by Morgan.

As the conversation went on, the journalist and TV presenter first offered Kompany £50 million, before upping his offer to '£60 million and 2 Ferrari's' to join Arsene Wenger's side.

Kompany, refused, claiming he 'plays for glory' now, leading Morgan into a sarcastic reply stating, 'What's that?'

Manchester City are in Champions League action on Wednesday night, when they face CSKA Moscow at the Etihad. 

The conversation between Piers Morgan and Vincent Kompany ended with the former asking 'What's glory?'
