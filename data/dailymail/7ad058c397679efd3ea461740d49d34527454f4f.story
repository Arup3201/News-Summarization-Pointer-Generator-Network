Rebekah Brooks has received payouts totalling more than £16million since she resigned from News International, it can be revealed.

The former News of the World editor walked away with £10.8million at the height of the phone hacking scandal in 2011 and received another £5.3million in the last financial year.

The payouts from Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation empire were for ‘compensation for loss of office’ but are understood to include the former chief executive’s legal fees to defend herself against the hacking charges during the eight-month trial.

And the acquittal of Mrs Brooks and her husband Charlie on all charges saw the celebrations start, with Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson among friends visiting the couple’s London home on Tuesday night.

The verdicts mean the 46-year-old would be entitled legally to ask the court to repay some of the costs of her defence from the public purse, although no application has yet been made.

News Corp has refused to reveal how much it has paid out in legal fees for the hacking trial – but it funded huge legal teams for six of the seven defendants, including Mr and Mrs Brooks and Andy Coulson.

Figures reported to the US Securities and Exchange Commission in May revealed the investigation into the hacking scandal had cost the firm $535million (£315million).

That includes pay-outs to 718 hacking victims to settle civil claims, and legal fees for the civil and criminal cases.

The company’s overall costs were previously reported to have reached £600million once redundancy pay-outs and lost revenues from the closure of the News of the World were included, and there has been speculation the scandal could end up costing it more than £1billion once all the trials are completed.

Mrs Brooks’ legal team was led by Jonathan Laidlaw QC and legal insiders suggested he was unlikely to have accepted the case for less than £6,000 per day, with a hefty ‘upfront’ fee.

The Crown Prosecution Service has revealed it spent £1.75million bringing the case to trial.

Before her arrest on the hacking charges, Mrs Brooks was one of the most influential women in Britain and mingled with the political elite.

Her first marriage to EastEnders actor Ross Kemp gave her an entree to the showbusiness world and she became the confidante of politicians and celebrities alike.

With her Old Etonian second husband, racehorse trainer Mr Brooks, she attended Royal Ascot, dined at the best restaurants and became a key part of the Chipping Norton set of media stars and politicians who live near the Brookses’ Cotswolds home.

Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s wife Sarah invited her to a sleepover at Chequers and she was a regular at David and Samantha Cameron’s ‘kitchen suppers’ in Oxfordshire.

That world of well-connected socialising appeared under threat after her arrest and trial. But friends stood by her.

Not guilty: Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie walked free hand in hand from the Old Bailey on Tuesday

Clarkson tweeted he was 'beyond ecstatic' when the couple were found not guilty

Clarkson watched from the public gallery at the Old Bailey as Mr Brooks gave evidence during the trial and later tweeted he was ‘beyond ecstatic’ when the couple were found not guilty.

The presenter, another member of the Chipping Norton set, was swift to join in the celebrations. He and a mystery woman friend were pictured among a number of friends who visited the couple’s London home on Tuesday night.

However, Clarkson seemed a little coy about being seen in public with his companion.

As they left the party, she went to link arms with him – only for the 54-year-old to shrug her away with a look of mild annoyance as TV cameras captured the incident.

Mrs Brooks acquittal may not automatically lead to her re-entry into the highest political circles.

But judging by Mr Clarkson’s rapid appearance at the Brookses’ home, she has already been welcomed back to the fold by some of her influential friends.
