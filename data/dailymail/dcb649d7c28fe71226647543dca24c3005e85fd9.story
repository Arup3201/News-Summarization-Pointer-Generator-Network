A-levels and GCSEs have got easier over the past decade, an official analysis has confirmed.

A series of reports by Ofqual, the exam watchdog, has found that  science and geography papers are ‘softer’ and ‘less demanding’.

Teenagers now have more multiple choice questions and papers with less scientific content.

The watchdog warns that the dumbing down is leaving pupils ill-prepared for university and means there is less opportunity for good students to shine.

Last week Glenys Stacey, the chief executive of Ofqual, said the value of exams had been undermined by more than a decade of ‘persistent grade inflation’ which was ‘impossible to justify’.

Four years ago, researchers from Durham University concluded that A-levels are now two grades easier than they were two decades ago. Sixth formers who would have got a grade C in the 1980s would now get an A.

Last night, the Department for Education said the reports ‘show evidence of a gradual decline in standards’. A spokesman said: ‘In particular these reports show that in recent years not enough has been demanded of students, and that they are not being asked to demonstrate real depth and breadth of knowledge.

‘It is good that Ofqual has already taken action to strengthen the science GCSEs and we are committed to restoring confidence in all GCSEs and A-levels as rigorous and valued qualifications.’

Slide: Since 2001 figures show more pupils are getting top grades

The watchdog conducted reviews of GCSEs and A-levels in biology and chemistry between 2003 and 2008 as well as A-level geography between 2001 and 2010 and A-level critical thinking in 2010.

The findings showed that among GCSEs, changes to the way the exams were structured had ‘reduced the demand’ of the qualifications, while the A-level reviews found that changes to the way papers were assessed had made them easier.

The A-level geography review found that the removal of coursework from the qualification in 2010 – which was usually a 4,000-word investigation – had made it ‘less demanding’.

It also revealed that there had been a shift ‘towards human geography and away from physical geography’, fewer subjects were covered and there were fewer chances to assess pupils’ skills.

The review added that the content of A-level geography had ‘softened’ and that harder topics, such as atmospheric systems, had been removed

GCSE biology was easier  because there were more short papers with multiple choice and short answer questions.

Ofqual added that reviewers were also struck by the ‘poor quality’ of some multiple choice questions, which sometimes included ‘trivial or irrelevant’ information and even ‘made-up words’ which made it easy for anyone with a basic command of the English language to pass.

The A-level biology study criticised WJEC, the Welsh exam board, for having a high percentage of short structured questions, which reduced the amount of information pupils had to read.

The CCEA exam board in Northern Ireland was over-generous in its marking of some questions and had less demanding coursework, Ofqual added.

The A-level chemistry review found that the exams had become easier between 2003 and 2008 because the questions were structured differently.

‘In 2008 there were more short answer questions, involving simple recall, and fewer questions that required students to formulate multiple-step responses,’ the report said.

In a statement, Ofqual said that GCSEs are due to be revised after the current review of the national curriculum, while  A-levels will also be reviewed.

Damian Hinds, a Tory member of the Commons education select committee, said: ‘I doubt there is anyone left who will be surprised to hear that standards were eroded under Labour.

‘Many ways were found to make the results tables look better, and many young people given bad advice to take more “accessible” subjects and supposed GCSE equivalents.

‘Now we know that even within these traditional subjects papers became easier.

‘In the end the people it lets down are the students who worked so hard for those exams, and it is right for young people’s sake that this government is determined to ensure rigour in exams.’
