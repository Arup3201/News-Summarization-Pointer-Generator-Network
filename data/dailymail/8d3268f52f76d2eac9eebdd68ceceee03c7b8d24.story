Jimmy Hill – one of the most influential figures in English football and the face of Match of the Day for 25 years – is suffering from Alzheimer’s, it emerged yesterday.

The 85-year-old former footballer and television presenter is living in a care home near the South Coast after his condition deteriorated.

Hill was diagnosed in 2008, but his battle with dementia only came to light yesterday amid a legal wrangle over his assets.

He had given joint powers of attorney
to his current wife Bryony, 62, and a solicitor in 2005, when he was 
still in good health.

But 
Hill’s five children from his two previous marriages only discovered the
existence of the legal document in 2008, when Hill was deemed by 
doctors to be too ill to look after himself. As a result, none has any 
say over his future treatment or the management of his assets.

His
condition was made public yesterday by his youngest son Jamie, 46, and 
his daughter Joanna, 50, who are his two children from his second 
marriage.

The pair said 
they decided to raise awareness of their father’s illness to highlight 
concerns over the difficulties that arise when a parent with a large 
extended family becomes too poorly to make decisions for themselves.

Mr
Hill junior, a property consultant who lives in West London, said: 
‘This will become a more common problem over the years because there are
so many families in the same position as ours. Because of the power of 
attorney, the children have no say over decisions over dad’s health care
or his assets.’

Jimmy Hill had a massive impact on English football.

During
his successful playing career he became chairman of the Professional 
Footballers’ Association in 1957 and later a manager. While at the PFA 
he succeeded in scrapping the maximum wage for players, paving the way 
for today’s multi-million-pound footballers.

He
also pioneered all-seater stadiums and was instrumental in introducing 
the ‘three points for a win’ rule in 1981 that helped transform the 
modern game into a far more exciting spectacle.

His broadcasting career spanned 40 years and he racked up 600 appearances on Match of the Day.

Mr
Hill junior, who visits his father at the nursing home where he has 
been since last year, said: ‘He is the most sprightly physical specimen 
in the home, but his mind is not what it was.

‘The home is the best place for him. That is not my complaint.

‘My concern is we only discovered in 2008 that power of attorney had been signed three years earlier.

‘We said in 2008 that if Bryony’s lawyer steps aside and one of us children has joint power of attorney, we will be happy.

‘Unfortunately,
that was declined. We were told they had considered giving one of the 
children power of attorney in 2005, but decided against because it would
have been too difficult to choose just one.’  Mr Hill has raised the 
issue with his local MP, Justine Greening, the International Development
Secretary.

Joanna Hill, 
who lives in Mexico, added: ‘It is a shame that we as his children have 
no rights over his care. Children whose parents have married more than 
once should be made aware that they will be unable to influence their 
affairs if they register a power of attorney.’

In
his autobiography Hill admitted he had made mistakes in his private 
life and caused upset. Hill married his first wife Gloria, with whom he 
had three children, in 1950, when his playing career was taking off. He 
left her when his eldest son Duncan was only seven for his second wife 
Heather.

He and Heather had
two children but that marriage ended when Hill met Veronica Hopcraft on
a football tour to the Caribbean to celebrate Coventry City’s promotion
to the old first division.

Hill
went on to hire Bryony, then 25, as his PA. They embarked on an affair 
behind Miss Hopcraft’s back. The couple married 20 years ago and have 
been together ever since. Bryony Hill was unavailable for comment 
yesterday.
