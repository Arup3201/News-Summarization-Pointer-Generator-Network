Jailed: Junior Hall was convicted of raping a girl who had been afraid to report the crime

A vile rapist whose terrified 11-year-old victim decided not to go to police because of an EastEnders storyline was today jailed for 11 years.

Junior Hall, 41, attacked the girl after she called him gay - and he later tried to bribe her with a £20 note.

While carrying out the rape, he told her: ‘I’m not gay, I like this too much.’

The victim, who cannot be named, tried to tell her mother but felt she was not believed because the case was too similar to a plot from the BBC soap.

The storyline in question was a 2001 plot in which Maureen ‘Little Mo’ Mitchell was raped by her long-term partner Trevor Morgan for buying a hat to wear to her sister's wedding.

Mo confided to her sister Kat but said she did not want to go to court and repeat details to a courtroom full of strangers.

Later in the series, Mo killed Trevor with an iron.

Hall's victim, who watched EastEnders, convinced herself that her mother did not believe her account because of its similarity to the plot.

She also believed that, if she reported the crime, her experience would be similar to Mo's and she would not get the support she needed.

She did not realise that she would be able to give evidence behind a screen.

The attack, which was eventually 
reported in 2010, took place at some point between June 2001 and June 
2003 when the girl was aged eleven or twelve.

The court was told the girl only summoned enough courage to go to police in 2010 when she was an adult.

Hall denied rape, claiming the attack never took place, but a jury at the Old Bailey found him guilty by an 11-1 majority after more than three-and-a-half hours of deliberation.

Judge Timothy Pontius told him: 'She was completely defenceless when you assaulted her.

'She is very much to be congratulated, not only for her courage in reporting to police, but in the remarkable turnaround in her life.'

The judge said the girl had fallen into serious crime, but had chosen another path and achieved considerable academic achievement.

'She is a confident, articulate woman with strength of character,' he added.

Speaking about why it had takent he girl so long to come forward prosecutor Mark Gadsden said: ‘At the time she felt the matter should be reported to police.

‘She said she was influenced by a storyline in the programme EastEnders and didn’t want to go through a court case as she didn’t get any support.’

Mr Gadsden added: 'They were playfighting together. She accused him of essentially being gay because he was not fighting hard enough and she was winning.

'His response to that was to grab hold of her and put his hands down her tracksuit bottoms.'
