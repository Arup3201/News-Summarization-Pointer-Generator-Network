The bride was an eccentric 85-year-old billionaire with more titles than Queen Elizabeth II. The groom was a mere civil servant young enough to be her son.

Despite the objections of her six children and plenty of public controversy, Spain’s colourful Duchess of Alba wed Alfonso Diez, 60, at her 15th century palace in Seville yesterday.

The famously flamboyant Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart wore a delicate pale pink gown designed by Victorio y Lucchino for her third marriage, which took place in front of 38 guests.

Well-wishers donned fancy dress and wigs in an attempt to copy her quirky style as they celebrated in the city’s streets.

Reveller Pedro Ramirez, 28, said: ‘The Duchess is extremely popular here.’

The twice-widowed Duchess’s children 
feared Diez was a gold-digger – so he has relinquished his rights to her
 £3billion fortune in an effort to appease them.

A crowd of several hundred clapped and 
roared its approval as the Duchess waved and danced on a red carpet 
following her wedding to Diez at Palacio de las Duenas, her 
opulent 15th-century residence in the cobble-stoned old quarter of 
Seville.

The duchess, who is a distant relative of Winston Churchill and Princess Diana,  went ahead with the marriage despite her children’s qualms.

It emerged in August that she has 
divided her fortune between her six children to convince them that her 
suitor is besotted with her rather than her money. 

And she certainly seemed like a young
 girl in love, celebrating after the ceremony by kicking off her shoes 
and dancing a bit of flamenco.

Known now for her frizzy white hair, 
squeaky voice and wildly colourful clothes, the duchess is among Spain’s 
most famous people.

And scandal threatened to overshadow the day when earlier this week the Spanish magazine Interviu published a 30-year-old photograph of
 the duchess sunbathing topless in Ibiza.

He lawyer Javier Saavedra said: 'We are considering suing for interfering with her rights to privacy.'

While hundreds of well-wishers and press gathered outside the gates only a few dozen family members and close friends were invited to the ceremony.

The twice-widowed duchess wore a pale pink knee-length dress by Spanish designers Victorio y Lucchino on Tuesday.

Her full name - take a deep breath - 
is Maria del Rosario Cayetana Alfonsa Victoria Eugenia Francisca 
Fitz-James Stuart y de Silva.

She goes by simply Cayetana, and is a distant relative of Queen Elizabeth and Winston Churchill.

She and Diez, a social security administration employee, are old acquaintances through her second husband, who was a former priest, and Diez’s brother.

They bumped into each other about three years ago outside a cinema in Madrid and eventually started dating.

Her six children, all from her first marriage, reportedly balked when the idea of marriage emerged.

In July of this year she assigned them and her grandchildren juicy chunks of her vast estate, including mansions and palaces, in an effort to appease them.

Estimates of her wealth range from  600million and 3.5billion euros.

The duchess's fortune includes palaces and mansions throughout Spain, paintings by the likes of Velazquez, Goya and Rubens and huge stretches of land.

Two of the children did not attend the wedding.

Her only daughter, Eugenia, was reported to be in hospital in Madrid with chicken-pox, while one of her sons, named Jacobo and reportedly unhappy with his slice of the family fortune, was said to be travelling outside Spain.
