Eliza Houghton returned to her car late on Tuesday night after working hard all day and spotted that someone had crashed into her Hyundai Getz parked at the train station. 

Then she spotted a note tucked under the windscreen wiper and assumed that the person who had crashed into her vehicle had done the right thing and left their details.

But this was not the case for the  radio producer, who had parked her car outside Geelong station, south of Melbourne. Instead, Ms Houghton, who works for Tom Elliot's Drive show on Melbourne station 3AW, returned to her car to find a very 'insulting' note left on it.

This offensive letter was left on Eliza Houghton's car while it was parked at Geelong Station on Tuesday

'Sorry I dont (sic) have insurance - damaged your car you look rich enough to fix it yourself,' the rude letter read, which was posted to Twitter by Elliot on Wednesday afternoon.

Houghton described the letter to Daily Mail Australia as 'pathetic' and the person who left it as a 'jerk'.

Houghton described the note as 'pathetic' and said she couldn't believe people would do something like that

'I got back to my car after work last night and saw this jerk had left me a message', she said.

Although there was no missing mirrors or doors, the culprit left an array of dents and scratches on the producer's car.

'It would have been nice if they'd left their details, but there are these types of people in the world', Houghton said.

She works on Tom Elliot's Drive radio show on 3AW in Melbourne, who shared the note on Twitter

'Who does that!' she added.

As for the accusation that her car made her look 'rich', Houghton laughed and said she drives and old Hyundai Getz.

'It's not really a car that I would imagine a 'rich' person would drive,' she said.

Despite the note's claims that she was 'rich', Eliza Houghton drives a humble Hyundai Getz
