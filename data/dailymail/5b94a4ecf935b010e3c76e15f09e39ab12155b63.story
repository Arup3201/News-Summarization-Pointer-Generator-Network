Country music singer Hank Williams Jr canceled a Fox News Channel interview on Tuesday and said he was sorry for any offence given by his recent statement comparing President Barack Obama to Adolf Hitler.

The apology of sorts was posted on his website a day after the Disney-owned cable sports channel ESPN pulled Williams' theme song from its latest Monday Night Football broadcast in a rebuke to the country star for his Hitler remark.

Appearing on the Fox News morning programme Fox & Friends on Monday, Williams said he thought that a June 18 golf summit pairing Obama with Republican House speaker John Boehner in the midst of the congressional budget crisis had 'turned a lot of people off'.

Apology: Hank Williams Jr said he was sorry for any offence caused in his remarks comparing Obama to Hitler

Asked what he didn't like about the friendly bipartisan golf match, Williams replied: 'Come on! It'd be like Hitler playing golf with (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu.'

He went on to refer to Obama and Vice President Joe Biden as 'the enemy'.

After his All My Rowdy Friends song was yanked from the Monday Night Football opening by ESPN later that day in protest, Williams issued a statement acknowledging that his 'analogy was extreme' but insisting it was intended to illustrate how ludicrous he thought it was for Obama and Boehner to team up at golf.

'They're polar opposites and it made no sense. They don't see eye-to-eye and never will,' the bearded singer said.

Williams, 62, was scheduled to return
to the Fox News Channel with an interview on Tuesday on the Hannity 
show, but the network said that the singer decided to cancel.

Hours
later, he posted yet another, somewhat more contrite statement, saying:
'I have always been very passionate about politics and sports, and this
time it got the best or worst of me.

'The
thought of the leaders of both parties jukin and high fiven on a golf 
course, while so many families are struggling to get by simply made me 
boil over and make a dumb statement, and I am very sorry if it offended 
anyone,' he wrote.

He concluded, 'I would like to thank all my supporters. This was not written by some publicist.'

The
statement was posted just below a link to a video clip from the ABC 
daytime talk show The View, in which host Whoopi Goldberg suggested 
Williams was judged too harshly.

'Hank
is a musician, and he's always been provocative,' Goldberg said on the 
show. 'He could have chosen his words more wisely, but as someone who 
steps in it quite often, we all do it. Those among us who are without 
sin, cast the first stone.'

Reporting
on Williams' apology on its own website Tuesday night, ESPN said it had
no comment on whether his song would be used on future telecasts.
