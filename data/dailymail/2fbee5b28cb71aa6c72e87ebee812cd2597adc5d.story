Wardrobe nightmare: Simon Cowell's intruder was found hiding on a shelf in the BGT star's walk-in

The woman accused of breaking into Simon Cowell's home was found hiding on a seven-foot shelf in the pop mogul's walk-in wardrobe with blood-smeared walls by police.

Armed offices searched the property after the X Factor supremo called for help after coming face to face with Leanne Zaloumis, 29, who he says broke into his £9million property by smashing his bathroom window.

Cowell, 52, was left terrified after seeing the woman, who was said to be standing on the roof outside his shattered bathroom window holding a rock above her head, with her hands covered in blood.

He fled to his bedroom and his staff called Scotland Yard who immediately sent a squad of armed officers to his home.

After searching the grounds and gardens, firearms officers found an intruder hiding on a shelf seven feet up in a walk-in wardrobe with blood-smeared walls adjoining Cowell’s bedroom.

Yesterday Cowell was not present to see the accused woman, wearing a baggy grey sweatshirt, appear in court for the first time since the alleged break-in on Saturday night.

A charge of aggravated burglary with intent was read to her.

Paul Mitchell, prosecuting, said she ‘entered, as a trespasser, a dwelling with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm upon a person therein and at the time of committing the said burglary had with you a weapon of offence, namely a broken house brick’.

West London Magistrates’ Court heard how Cowell was watching TV in his  bedroom at 10.30pm when he heard a ‘loud bang’ in his bathroom on the first floor of his lavish home in West London, which used to be the French ambassador’s residence.

On entering the bathroom to investigate, he was confronted by a figure standing on a flat roof outside the window screaming as she held a rock aloft, Mr Mitchell said.

He told the court: ‘On Saturday 24th March around half past ten in the evening, Simon Cowell, a relatively high-profile celebrity, was watching TV in his bedroom.

'He then hears what he describes as a loud bang that he says comes from his bathroom which is located next to his bedroom.'

‘He goes to investigate and sees a figure outside his first-floor bathroom window. He could see that the window was already damaged and there was broken glass on the floor and around the window frame.’

Cowell has said that outside the window he could see a woman who was shouting and holding a rock above her head. He said he tried to speak to her but she continued to shout at him and then started to hit the window again with the rock.

Panicked, Cowell ran for help and a member of staff called police while others searched the garden and grounds. Within minutes, firearms officers had arrived.

With weapons drawn they searched his home, eventually finding a woman hiding on the shelf in the wardrobe where blood had been smeared on the walls during the ‘disturbing and frenzied’ break-in.

A woman was arrested at the scene and taken to a West London police station. Nothing was found on her apart from a few possessions including a coat and a handbag which did not belong to Cowell.

He told a friend: ‘It was scary . . . she was smashing her way into my bathroom with a rock and wouldn’t stop. Then she hid in the house.’

Cowell has 24-hour security at the property, which includes a team of guards based there. Bodyguards also join him at the studios during filming for his TV shows including Britain’s Got Talent and The X Factor.

Yesterday experts were examining how to make the mansion more secure.

Staff were cleaning the house to remove any traces of glass and blood left in the bathroom and wardrobe, which were said to have been caused by lacerations to the intruder’s hands.

Zaloumis spoke yesterday only to  confirm her name and her address in Catford, South-East London.

District Judge James Henderson remanded her in custody to appear again at Isleworth Crown Court on June 12.
