Missing: Dylan Alkins, 14, disappeared while playing in the surf at West Beach in Newhaven on Sunday

The parents of a 14-year-old feared dead after being swept out to sea in stormy weather have paid tribute to their 'amazing boy'.

Dylan Alkins vanished while playing in the surf with friends at West Beach in Newhaven, East Sussex, on Sunday afternoon.

As efforts continue to try to find his body, his parents Danny Alkins and Amy Kattenhorn today spoke publicly for the first time about their son.

Mr Alkins said Dylan would 'be sadly missed and never ever forgotten'. Ms Kattenhorn, meanwhile, said: 'I will hold on to Dylan forever in my heart'.

Friends of Dylan gathered on the beach this week to release balloons and throw flowers into the sea at the spot where he was last seen alive.

Mr Alkins paid tribute to the RNLI, Coastguards and police who have searched for Dylan, saying: 'They have done a great job to the best of their ability.'

In a statement released through Sussex Police, Mr Alkins said his family were 'crushed' and said it felt like 'I have lost half my life'.

He said: 'My son Dylan was an amazing boy, full of character, a very cheeky and loveable, talented young man. He will be sadly missed and never ever forgotten.

'To me it feels like I have lost half my life. Myself, his three younger brothers and step-mum are totally crushed by what has happened. It will never be the same for us.

'My boy was taken far too young. Heartbroken. I just want him back. I would appreciate me and my family need time to grieve in peace.'

Ms Kattenhorn added: 'No words can describe how I am feeling at this devastating time. My first-born son has been stolen from me and I am completely and utterly devastated by this tragic accident.

'I will hold on to Dylan forever in my heart and I have the best and amazing memories of him that nobody can ever take away from me.

'He was an amazing boy and will be sadly missed by all of his family and friends. I would be grateful if I could be left alone to grieve in peace at this difficult and heartbreaking time.

'It’s not goodbye, it’s till we meet again.'

Witnesses said that Dylan was among several teenagers who had been playing around on the beach as wind speeds were whipped up by the St Jude storm.

Rescue teams, including a Coastguard helicopter and an RNLI lifeboat, scoured the area in what were described as 'atrocious conditions' with poor visibility on Sunday.

But as time passed without finding Dylan, coastguards stood down their operation which has now shifted to trying to recover the teenager.

On Facebook, more than 6,000 people have 'liked' a tribute page set up in his memory. And on Twitter dozens of messages of condolence have been posted.

One person tweeted: 'Our hearts go out to the Alkins family this morning as Dylan is still missing. The sea can be a cruel mistress.'

Another tweet read: 'RIP Dylan Alkins. Another star in the sky :-( xx. Can’t even imagine what the family is going through. RIP Dylan Alkins.'
