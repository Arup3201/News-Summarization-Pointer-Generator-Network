Spanish men also topped the infidelity league in six European countries

The French and Italians are most likely to cheat on their partners - while the British are among the most faithful in Europe, a new poll has revealed.

More than half of French and Italian men, and a third of their women, have admitted to being unfaithful while in a relationship, the study showed.

Spanish men also topped the infidelity league in six European countries, but Spanish women were among the most faithful, the poll by Ifop for cheating website Gleeden found.

In Britain, 40 per cent of men and a quarter of women admitted to cheating, compared to 45 per cent of men and 42 per cent of women in Germany, and half of all men and one in three women in Belgium.

The study also found more than a third of all French people would be prepared to cheat if they were sure they wouldn't get caught.

This compares to 25 per cent of British people polled, 31 percent of Germans, 30 per cent of Belgians and Spanish and 28 per cent of Italians.

Around half of British respondents who admitted cheating say they regretted the act, where as only around a third of other nations polled said they felt any remorse.

A spokesman for Ifop said: "We can without doubt see the trace of Anglo-Saxon puritanism that permeates British society in terms of its moral morals and sexuality.

'There appears to be evidence that suggests infidelity is more common in Latin and Catholic countries, and less so in Protestant countries.'

The poll comes after French president Francois Hollande was caught cheating on his partner with glamorous actress Julie Gayet last month.

After the scandal erupted in January, his personal approval rating leapt to 31 per cent, up from 26 per cent in October.

The figures support a separate 2013 study by the Pew Research Center which found that the French were among the world's least offended by infidelity.

Around 53 per cent of French people reported last year that infidelity was morally acceptable, compared to 45 of the British, 40 per cent of Germans, 36 per cent of Spanish, 35 per cent of Italians and 16 per cent of Americans.
