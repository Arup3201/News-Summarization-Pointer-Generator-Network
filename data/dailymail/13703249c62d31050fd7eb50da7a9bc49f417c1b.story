A man spent four years creating the perfect star-studded proposal video for his girlfriend after persuading her favourite stars to take part in the secret project.

Session drummer Jim MacAulay recruited stars including Ed Sheeran, Cee Lo Green, Ronan Keating and X Factor host Dermot O’Leary for the video for girlfriend Sophie Hancock, 30.

Singers Martine McCutcheon and musician Nile Rodgers also featured in the five-minute proposal video, which Jim played to her just before Christmas.

Jim MacAulay spent four years collating a video proposal for fiance  Sophie Hancock featuring the likes of Dermot O'Leary, Bob Geldof, Nile Rogers but Ed Sheeran but David Hasselhoff didn't make the cut

The video starts with English comedian and actor Adam Buxton calling Jim an 'extraordinary man' and telling Sophie to marry him.

It then cuts to a blank screen with the message 'Sorry it’s taken so long...' before the words, 'LET’S GET MARRIED!! Please!?' appear on the screen.

Thinking Out Loud singer Ed Sheeran appears and shares a bizarre story about conceiving children before telling the couple to get married and 'have a bunch of kids'. 

X Factor presenter Dermot O’Leary also appears on screen to say: 'Sophie, for the love of the baby Jesus, marry Jim.' 

The musician joked that he felt under pressure to make the proposal perfect because the pair had been together for 12 years.

He said: 'It has to be quite good when you have left it so long to propose. I am lucky that I have got a job where I get to meet lots of famous people.

Musician Nile Rogers and Love Actually actress Martine McCutcheon  lent their support to the proposal video

'I deliberately asked people who I knew Sophie was a fan of. She loves Ed Sheeran so I was really pleased he was so willing to help out.

US singer Cee Lo Green also tells Sophie to marry Jim before Ronan Keating jokes: 'Sophie look I am sorry but you can’t have me but I tell you what, you can have your man Jim, go on.'

Actress Martine McCutcheon makes an appearance with the words '(more famous at time of recording)' appearing underneath her as she also encourages the couple to get hitched.

Even Bob Geldof gets involved, saying: 'Sophie, we’re over, there is no use waiting for me, just go to Jim, just marry him and just forget about us.'

Jim, who lives with Sophie in Kings Heath, Birmingham, spent four years creating the video before surprising his partner with it at a friend’s dinner party last Tuesday.

After four years of waiting, Sophie accepted Jim's offer of marriage after watching the celebrity-filled film

Jim, a session drummer, used to work with Rudimental who asked Ed Sheeran to appear on the video

'I think it’s a video she’ll keep for a long time. It took four years because you can’t just go up to people and ask them, you have to meet them and establish that you aren’t an idiot

'I was there when most of them were filmed. I work away a lot with different bands so got to meet most of them at radios or festivals.

'All of the people on the list are people Sophie likes so it is a bit of an eclectic mix.

'I think my favourite is Adam Buxton because I think he was the first one and we are both big fans.

'I met Dermot O’Leary when I was doing a live radio session and I used to work with Rudimental so they got Ed Sheeran for me when they did a US tour with him.

'We organised a surprise party for Sophie at a friend’s house under the pretense of it being a Christmas party.

'She was pretty surprised and excited, but I think really she was relieved I had asked. She said yes thankfully so it was all worthwhile.'

Sophie, a research manager, added: 'About 10 minutes after we arrived the host said her daughter had recorded a message for everyone so we all gathered round and then it cut to Jim's video.

'We've been together for 12 years and he was secretly working on the video for about four years.

'It was worth the wait though. Of course I said "yes".'

The video has already been viewed by 1,800 people after it was uploaded to YouTube and yesterday Jim revealed that some celebrities didn’t make the cut.

Cee Lo Green, left, was initially reluctant to appear on the video. Right, Tim Wheeler from Ash joined in too

He added: 'Bob Geldof was really nice and I met Cee Lo Green at a festival and he didn’t want to do it but he did anyway.

'You can’t see it on the camera but just out of shot is his massive minder who looked like he was going to kill me for asking.

'Not everyone made the final edit though. We had to cut David Hasselhoff because you couldn’t hear him over the background noise, which was a shame.'

The couple haven’t set a date for the wedding yet but plan to get married in 2015.
