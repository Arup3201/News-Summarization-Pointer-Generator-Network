Seven Marines were killed last night over the U.S. when their Cobra and Huey helicopters collided mid-air during an evening training exercise.

The U.S. Marines from the 3rd Marine Airwing unit in Miramar, California, were training near Yuma, Arizona, after dark on Wednesday at 8pm.

There were no survivors, the crash is being investigated and the identities of those killed will be released once families have been told.

Wreckage: Six of the victims were from Camp Pendleton, California - the largest base on the West Coast - and one was from Marine Corps Air Station Yuma

Six of the victims were from Camp Pendleton, California - the largest base on the West Coast - and one was from Marine Corps Air Station Yuma.

‘We're still gathering a lot of details as the sun comes up,’ Marine Corps spokesman Lieutenant Maureen Dooley at Miramar Air Base said.

The weather was mild on Wednesday when 
the helicopters were flying as part of a two-week standard training 
called 'Scorpion Fire'.

The crash happened at the Marine Corps Air Station near Yuma, which houses 14,000 personnel and 600 aircraft 
for ongoing training each year.

The base covers five square miles and 
supports 80 per cent of air-to-ground aviation training carried out by 
the Marine Corps, reported CNN.

Several accidents have occurred in the past year with training Marines.

In September, a helicopter went down during a training exercise at Camp Pendleton, killed the two Marines onboard and set off a brush fire.

In August, two Marines were ejected from their F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet as it plunged toward the Pacific Ocean.

The two Marines spent four hours in the dark, chilly ocean before they were rescued. Both suffered broken limbs but survived.

In July, a decorated Marine from New York was killed during a training exercise when his helicopter went down in a section of Camp Pendleton.

The Cobra carries a crew of two, a pilot and gunner, and is considered the Marines' main attack chopper

The UH-1Y, replacing the ageing version of the Huey utility helicopter first used in Vietnam, carries a crew of one or two pilots, a crew chief and other crew members.

Another Hornet sustained $1million damage when its engine caught fire on March 30 aboard the USS John C. Stennis in a training exercise

Eight sailors, a Marine and two civilians were injured off the coast.

A decade ago, in February 2002, there was a major helicopter crash in the Chocolate Mountains in eastern Imperial County, Califorinia.

It killed two Camp Pendleton Marines and injured two others. The Huey was on a routine training mission in the Naval gunnery range.
