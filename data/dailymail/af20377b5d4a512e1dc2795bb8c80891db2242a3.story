Crystal Palace are in talks over a move for QPR's Jordon Mutch.

Palace are understood to have made a loan enquiry then had an offer of around £4million dismissed by Rangers who signed Mutch for £5.5m last summer. 

Mutch is keen on a move away, after finding playing time hard to come by at Loftus Road.
