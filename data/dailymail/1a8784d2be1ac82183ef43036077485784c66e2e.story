A two-year-old polar bear named Pixel has arrived at a wildlife park in Yorkshire to join England's only other polar bear.

Victor, a 16-year-old, half-tonne bear who has lived at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park in Doncaster since August has now been joined by younger male Pixel.

The park said Pixel is 14 years younger and a third of the size of his new compound-mate.

Pixel (pictured) a two-year-old polar bear from a zoo just outside Eindhoven in the Netherlands has arrived at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park in Doncaster, where he joins resident 16-year-old polar bear Victor

On Monday, Pixel was transported in a specialist lorry to Rotterdam for the overnight ferry trip to Hull

Once Pixel is settled the park plans to introduce him to Victor as soon as possible

Pixel soon made himself at home in his enclosure and immediately began exploring his new surroundings

'Male polar bears will leave their mothers at approximately two years old,' said Animal Development Manager Simon Marsh.

'This means it is quite natural for Pixel to wander and find other males to hang around with. 

'Pixel is very playful and finds everything interesting and will be sure to keep Victor and the visitors entertained.'

The park said Pixel, who may one day be part of the European Breeding Programme, was brought to YWP from a zoo outside Eindhoven in the Netherlands in an operation this week.

Polar bears are a species that are increasingly being threatened in their native habitat

On Monday he was transported in a specialist lorry to Rotterdam for the overnight ferry trip to Hull, arriving at the South Yorkshire park on yesterday morning.

Mr Marsh said Victor, who weighs 480kg, gave a roar when he realised there was an new arrival at Project Polar, the park's purpose-built 10 acre polar bear reserve.

He said: 'Victor was immediately on his guard when he realised another polar bear was there. But after a roar or two he settled down.

Once released in the enclosure Pixel immediately took a dip following his long journey from the Netherlands

To his obvious delight the polar bear caught a fish in the large pond within his enclosure

'Once Pixel is settled in the plan will be to introduce them together as soon as possible. Pixel is going to look so small compared to big old Victor.'

Mr Marsh added: 'Polar bears are an iconic species that are increasingly threatened in their native habitat and we need to fight their cause.

'Their native sea ice is disappearing due to climate change but we still have a chance to do something about it and at Project Polar we can share with visitors how they can help.

'It is also vital that we understand how to care for these bears appropriately in captivity and provide for their needs.

'The initial research into Victor has been extremely encouraging and Pixel's arrival is a bonus.'

Pixel appears very pleased with himself as he returns his catch to the bank before eating it
