China is building the world's first hack-proof computer network in a bid to give it the edge in its cyberwar against the West, it has been reported.

A £60million fibre-optic cable between Beijing and Shanghai is being developed that will secure government, financial and military information from eavesdroppers.

The network will be up and running in two years time and will transmit quantum encryption keys to keep information safe.

It is being funded by the central government and at first will be used for money transfers by ICBC, the world's largest bank.

The project is being led by Professor Pan Jianwei, a quantum physicist at the Unversity of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

He told the Telegraph: 'We learnt after the Edward Snowden affair that we are always being hacked.

'Since most of the products we buy come from foreign companies, we wanted to accelerate our own programme. This is very urgent because classical encryption was not invented in China, so we want to develop our own technology.'

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) – delivers private data using the smallest possible packets of light.

If the line tries to be tapped into, it will disturb the encoding and will be detected, providing security.

The news comes after a a representative study on internet attack traffic has revealed that China is the country where the largest number of attacks originate.

By monitoring connections on the web it was shown that 43 per cent of online attacks originated in China, more than three times Indonesia in second place with 15 per cent.

And the researchers add that general internet users can keep themselves safe by frequently updating their software.

The attacks in the study refer to attempts by a computer to connect to specific ports on the internet, which would indicate a hacked or infected computer that was trying to connect to other computers.

Akamai’s David Belson, Editor of the report, explains to MailOnline that the results should not be taken as a view of the Internet as a whole, but rather only as representative findings.

‘We’re basically saying from the systems we’ve got out there, 43 per cent of the attacks we observe are coming from China,’ he says.

When asked if he’d expect similar results if every connection on the internet was monitored, he says: ‘It’s hard to say if they’d be similar. 

'Other attack traffic studies have placed China in top spot [like Akamai], others have placed other countries top.’
