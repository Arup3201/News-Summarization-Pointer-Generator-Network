A father  was just 'seconds from death' after a bite from a false widow spider triggered a heart attack. 

Eugene Murphy, from Dublin, was bitten three times on the shoulder by the spider - while his four-year-old son was on his lap.

The 28-year-old said he stopped breathing as the pain ripped through his body and he went into cardiac arrest after the attack at his parents' house. 

At one point during his seizure the father-of-one was convulsing so badly he had to be tied to a bed for his own safety, the Daily Star reports. 

After he was rushed to hospital, he spent 24 hours in intensive care while medics battled to save him. 

He said: 'I have never felt pain like it. I pulled off my shirt and saw the spider getting stuck in.

'I ripped it off my shoulder and its fangs tore a lump of my skin away with it.'

He said the pain ripped through his body, making him feel like he was on fire before he fell unconscious. 

Mr Murphy said he woke up in intensive care but was later told he had been injected with adrenaline to doctors tried to restart his heart. At one point Mr Murphy was hooked up to seven drips in an attempt to flush the venom from his system.

He said: 'The doctors said I’d have died if I was alone when I was bitten.

'I was once knocked down by a car and I got up after it hit me but this thing laid me out.'

They've inspired terror into millions, sparking complaints that their danger has been over-hyped. So what are false widow spiders?

Much of their reputation is thought to be thanks to the black widow, which although similarly named is far more dangerous and has been known to kill children, ill or elderly people.

Although its bites can be intensely uncomfortable - swelling hugely when infected - the false widow (above) is not known to have caused any deaths in Britain.

By comparison, around four Britons each year are though to die from bee or wasp stings when they have an allergic reaction.

False widow spiders are distinctive with their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns.

Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, are found across the UK and the population is growing.

Also known by its Latin name Steatoda Nobilis, its first British sighting was in Torquay, Devon, in 1879 and is thought to have remained largely in southern England. 

But the Natural History Museum says warmer summers mean the spider is spreading north, a theory backed by wildlife sightings.

As Britain's most venomous spider species, false widows made headlines last year when victims told how they had suffered huge wounds and almost lost limbs.

An entire secondary school was shut in October last year in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, after an outbreak of the arachnids in its ICT block had to be fumigated.

In the worst cases, suspected bite victims have been treated in hospital or complained of ongoing health problems several months later.

But many experts insist the spiders are not particularly dangerous and will only bite if approached or handled.

There have been no reported deaths from the spiders in Britain, where they are believed to have arrived on crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the 1870s.

It is thought many of the worst reactions happen when bites become infected, rather than being linked to the spider's venom itself.
