Kevin Pietersen managed just one run from three balls as his Melbourne Stars sides were smashed for the second game in succession.

The former England batsman had scored an impressive 66 in his first Big Bash League match on Thursday but he failed with the bat against the Hobart Hurricanes on Saturday.

Pietersen, 34, was dismissed after being caught by Ben Dunk off the bowling of Ben Hilfenhaus.

And the Stars lost the match by 52 runs having only posted 138 for nine from their 20 overs in reply to the Hurricanes' 190 for five.

Jonathan Wells was the hero for the away side at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, top-scoring with 68.

But it was Darren Sammy's unbeaten 38 from 12 balls which stole the show and ensured the Hurricanes set an unattainable target.
