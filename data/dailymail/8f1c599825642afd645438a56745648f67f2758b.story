Excitedly unwrapping her Christmas present, Sundeep Sandhu was delighted to discover her husband Mark had bought her an Apple iPad2.

But her joy soon turned to disbelief when the in-demand tablet computer turned out to be a slab of clay.

Mr Sandhu was one of up to ten people in the Vancouver area who bought an iPad2 only to discover modelling clay inside the gadget's sealed box.

Bitter disappointment: Up to ten people in the Vancouver area have bought an iPad2 only to discover a slab of modelling clay inside the gadget's sealed box

Christmas present: Mark Sandhu bought his wife Sundeep the CA$620 device from a branch of Future Shop

He had purchased the device at a 
branch of Future Shop. Other disappointed customers had bought their 
iPads there and at Best Buy.

Both stores have now teamed up with Apple to launch a fraud investigation into the scam, reported Canadian network CTV.

It
is thought the conmen paid for the iPads in cash, removed the devices 
and replaced them with clay, then resealed the box and returned it to 
the shop for a cash refund.

The counterfeit tablets were then put back on the shelves and sold to unsuspecting customers.

Elliott Chun, a spokesman for Future Shop, said: 'Customers don't expect to receive this 
kind of product from Future Shop, so it's a very serious matter and 
something we are addressing right away for anyone who has been 
impacted.'

All gone: Even the plug in the iPad2 box was a block of clay

Real thing: The iPad2 is proving immensely popular with gadget lovers. One million devices were sold in its first weekend on sale last March

Mr Sandhu said his wife at first 
thought the clay was protecting the CA$620 (Â£400) device. Then the 
couple noticed that its plug was also made of clay, and the penny 
dropped.

But when he tried to return the clay 
iPad to Future Shop, staff there refused to believe his story. He also 
contacted Apple and the police, only to get nowhere.

Mr Sandhu then got in touch with CTV 
journalist Lynda Steele, who discovered that a number of people in the 
Vancouver area had fallen victim to the scam.

He has now received an apology from 
Future Shop, has been refunded the CA$620 he paid for the fake device 
and given a free - and genuine - iPad2 for his trouble.
