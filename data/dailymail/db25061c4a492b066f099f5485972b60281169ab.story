For almost 150 years, blue plaques have celebrated famous former residents, becoming in that time a much-loved feature of the British townscape. So the announcement by English Heritage, which runs the scheme in London, that it is suspending installation of the signs because of Government funding cuts has been greeted with mournful sighs by conservation groups.

Yet for those who own a property already adorned with a plaque, it might be good news.

Blue plaques add prestige and historical interest, and those already erected are likely to be cherished to an even greater extent, and may help to increase a property’s value.

Mark of distinction: The five-bedroom home in London's Brook Green has an asking price of £4.5 million, in part thanks to the blue enamelled plaque

Sui Chin McKeand is one of a handful of people with a blue-plaque property on the market.

Her house in Brook Green, West London, which has an asking price of £4.5 million, was once occupied by the illustrator and engraver Sir Frank Short, who died in 1945 aged 87.

A plaque in his honour was erected in the Forties by London County Council and has since been approved by English Heritage.

Retired lawyer Sui Chin, 59, who is from Singapore but moved to England in 1985, bought the house with her late husband James McKeand in 1991 for £625,000.

James, a solicitor, died ten years ago, and with her daughter Claire, 28, spending most of her time elsewhere, Sui Chin is now looking for a smaller property.

Rising up: The plaque adds to the value of the Grade II listed five-bedroom property built in 1820

She confesses that in 1991 the blue 
plaque was hardly a consideration when she decided to buy, and she had 
no knowledge of Sir Frank, who was president of the Royal Society of 
Painter-Etchers.

‘I wanted a property with off-street parking and my husband liked the garden,’ she says.

Since then, however, she has embraced the prestige the plaque has bestowed on her home and ‘formed  a relationship’ with her house’s previous occupant.

‘Out of curiosity, I did some research
on Sir Frank and learned about his career. It was through this research
that I managed to find some of his works at a gallery,’ she says, 
pointing out three prints that hang on a wall in the ground-floor dining
room.

The prints are now 
part of the fabric of the house and Sui Chin says she will consider 
offers for them from buyers of the house if they want to retain its link
to Short.

Sui Chin was 
also obliged to form a relationship with English Heritage over her plans
to renovate the five-storey Grade II listed house, which was built in 
1820.

When she bought it, part of the property was in commercial use – a South African company used two floors as an office.

Sui Chin wanted to restore it to a single dwelling but English Heritage laid down a number of restrictions regarding what she could do. She spent £260,000 on the renovations, benefiting from the VAT exemption on work restoring older homes. This exemption was scrapped last October, except in cases where derelict properties are being salvaged.

‘English Heritage was very particular about some things. It was almost as if they wanted you to live like someone in the Victorian era,’ she says. ‘For example, the house had 11 fireplaces and I was allowed to remove only one, and I wasn’t allowed to cut through any joists.’

Making his mark: Frank Short, painter and engraver, who lived in the West London property after which the blue plaque was erected in his honour

Now, with five bedrooms, three receptions, three bathrooms, a dining room and a conservatory, the house makes a fine family home. Sui Chin also points out that the basement floor, which has its own entrance, kitchen and bathroom, could be used  as a separate dwelling. Jonathan Haward, of County Homesearch, a company that finds homes for prospective buyers, believes the blue plaque will add value in light of the decision to suspend the scheme.

‘It adds terrifically to the history of a house,’ he says, ‘which helps it to sell and it could help attract multiple buyers, so driving up the price.

‘With English Heritage deciding not to consider new applications for now, this will especially apply to those selling homes with existing plaques.’

James Rideout, of selling agents Hamptons International, says: ‘This house is a local landmark and has generated a host of enquiries, particularly from international buyers fascinated by British history.’
