Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald apologized on Tuesday for telling a homeless veteran that he served in U.S. Army Special Forces.

'Special Forces? What years? I was in special forces,' McDonald said when the homeless man told him he had served among the Army's elite troops.

The late January comments were caught on camera for a CBS piece about the continued large numbers of homeless veterans.

But McDonald never served in Special Forces, and on Tuesday he held a press conference to beg for forgiveness and explain the lie.

'I made a mistake and I apologize for it,' he said. 'I have no excuse for it.'

'It was a misstatement, it was a mistake,' he told reporters.

Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald (pictured, left, and right, in his 1975 yearbook photo) admitted that he lied when he told a homeless man in Los Angeles that he had served in the Army special forces as well

McDonald had already admitted to embellishing his resume on Monday, telling The Huffington Post, 'I incorrectly stated that I had been in Special Forces. That was inaccurate and I apologize to anyone that was offended by my misstatement.'

'I have no excuse,' he told the news publication.

'I reacted spontaneously and I reacted wrongly, [with] no intent in any way to describe my record any different than it is,' McDonald, who left the Army in 1980 and eventually became CEO of Procter & Gamble, said.

'As I thought about this later I knew this [claim] was wrong,' he said of his exchange with the unidentified homeless man. 

The secretary completed Army Ranger training but never served in the elite force. 

He instead became a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division after his graduation from West Point.

Asked on Tuesday if he considered resigning over the flap, McDonald was demure, and he ignored a reporter who asked if he had spoken with the president.

The White House stood behind McDonald on Monday and again on Tuesday when pressed by reporters to weigh in.

'Secretary McDonald has apologized for the misstatement and noted that he never intended to misrepresent his military service,' it said in a statement Monday.

'We take him at his word and expect that this will not impact the important work he's doing to promote the health and well-being of our nation's veterans.'

Noting McDonald's past service, White House spokesman Josh Earnest on Tuesday said the VA Secretary 'understands first hand the sacrifices that our men and women in uniform make' and again lent him the White House's support.

'There's no reason to think that the mistake he made should interfere with his ability to lead the fight for our veterans,' Earnest said.

McDonald also got the support of a top Republican on House Armed Services and Veterans Affairs Committees. 

'The secretary's misstatement was an error, but it doesn't dim the fact that he served honorably,' said Rep. Mike Coffman, also a veteran said. 'We should all take him at his word and Washington shouldn't spend the next two weeks arguing about it.'

Coffman said that McDonald 'has a job to do — clean up the scandal-plagued VA,' and 'this latest controversy shouldn't shift one iota of focus away from that long overdue task.'

McDonald's interaction with the unidentified man was captured on camera by CBS, who were doing a story

McDonald was appointed by President Barack Obama last year and the White House released a statement saying 'We take him at his word and expect that this will not impact the important work he's doing'

Army Special Forces, also called the Green Berets, are highly trained units analogous to the Navy SEALs or the Marine Corps' Raider Regiment.

Instead of answering to the ordinary chain of command, they fall under the Department of Defense's U.S. Special Operations Command. 

McDonald replaced former Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki last year, after he resigned amid a scandal over long wait times for veterans at VA hospitals.

Revelations about McDonald's false service claims follow the suspension of NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams for repeatedly telling a false story about being shot at during the war in Iraq.

Williams later said that his helicopter was right behind one that was shot at, which was also not true. 

 A story published by the left-wing magazine Mother Jones this week also questioned whether Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly has been truthful about his reporting of the Falklands War.

The new secretary's appointment followed Eric Shinseke's resignation amid a scandal over waiting times at VA hospitals

Journalists who were on the ground with O'Reilly at the time have rushed to his defense, however, agreeing with his version of events. 

Conservatives on Twitter, who mocked Williams by creating photos of him at the moon landing and other impossible places, voiced their frustration with the news about McDonald.

'Brian Williams remembers going out on a special forces mission with Robert McDonald,' Washington, D.C. political fundraiser Nathan Wurtzel said.

Special forces members generally become upset when soldiers who did not serve in one of the four designated special operations forces claims they did.

Retired Army Col. Gary Bloomberg called McDonald's remarks 'a boneheaded statement' but said service members' anger would not be as strong as in other cases where soldiers wear medals they did not earn.

A statement from the American Legion National Commander Michael D. Helm said, 'He did complete Ranger training and served honorably with the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division. But a lie is a lie.

'I can’t believe people do this. What a disappointment from the leader of a department whose number one issue right now is the restoration of trust. He should be held to a higher standard,' the head of the nation's largest veterans organization said. 

'The secretary has apologized, as he certainly should. We hope that he can restore the trust that he has lost.'
