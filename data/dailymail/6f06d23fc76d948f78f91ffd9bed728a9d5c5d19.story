Dougie Freedman’s unbeaten start at Nottingham Forest continued with his finest scalp to date — promotion-chasing Bournemouth.

Henri Lansbury struck a beautiful, curling free-kick to win the match and take his tally to five — one in each of Freedman’s games as boss.

Bournemouth are now without a victory in four games but manager Eddie Howe says they can still finish in the top two.

‘The way we started I’m baffled how we lost,’ he said. ‘A lot of teams will write us off but we have to make sure we don’t panic and use whatever criticism we get as fuel to fire us again.’

Forest’s play-off hopes remain a distant prospect — they are 12 points behind sixth-placed Watford — but this took their haul to 13 points and 16 goals since Freedman took over from Stuart Pearce.

Bournemouth went ahead inside three minutes when Andrew Surman bent in a wonderful long-range shot.

Forest looked swamped, but Jamaal Lascelles got them back in the game in the 20th minute. His effort from distance deflected over and from Ben Osborn’s corner the ball fell loose to Lascelles, who fired home.

A minute before half-time Simon Francis brought down Michail Antonio 25 yards out and Lansbury did the rest.

Freedman said: ‘It was a disciplined performance. My players stuck to the game plan and worked their way into the game. It was a victory for determination.’
