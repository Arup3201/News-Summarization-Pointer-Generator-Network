'I’m worried about somebody in our government might kill him with a cruise missile or a drone missile,' Mr Paul explained in an interview this morning.

'I mean we live in a bad time where American citizens don’t even have rights and that they can be killed, but the gentlemen is trying to tell the truth about what’s going on.'
