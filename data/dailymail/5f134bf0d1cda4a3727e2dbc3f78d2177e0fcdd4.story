and prepared for today's service

The Sultan is Prime Minister of the small oil-rich Muslim sultanate that has been governed for 600 years by the same royal family, and also holds the roles of finance and defence minister.

The sultan has 12 children, five sons 
and seven daughters, from his three marriages, and the wedding is the 
first involving one of the sultan’s children since 2007.

The couple then exchanged their vows in front of some the most powerful people in the region including Prime Minister Najib Razak of neighbouring Malaysia.

The
 guest list for the wedding was not released ahead of the day, but many 
international royals and dignitaries were preparing to attend, including
 Prime Minister Najib Razak, the Prime Minister of neighbouring Malaysia

The couple will now be officially presented to the royal court in an elaborate ceremony on Sunday that marks the climax of more than a week of wedding-related festivities.

Southeast Asian leaders and foreign royalty are expected to be among the guests at a lavish royal banquet in honour of the newlyweds in the Islamic sultanate on Sunday night, hosted by the bride’s father, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, 66.

This week’s festivities have included 
nightly vigils at the palace to bless the couple, but the monarchy will 
forgo a traditional public procession through the capital in the royal 
family’s gilded Rolls Royce.

Such weddings are typically a rare 
source of excitement in Brunei, which is known for its slow pace of life
 and lack of nightlife.

The wedding of Crown Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah in
 2004 attracted large crowds in the capital, Bandar Seri Begawan, and a 
guest list of over 2,000 people including members of the royal families 
of Japan, Jordan, Britain and Malaysia.

Happy occasion: Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, right, and Queen Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Hajah Saleha, who both looked delighted during the ceremony, have 12 children
