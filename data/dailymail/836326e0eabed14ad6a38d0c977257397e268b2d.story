Assaulted: Ray Widstrand, 26, suffered potentially fatal brain swelling after he was attacked by a gang of youths

A man is in a critical condition after he was brutally assaulted by a teenage gang, a stone's throw from the local police station.

Ray Widstrand was enjoying a late-night walk through 
his neighbourhood on St Paul’s East Side and was attacked as he walked 
through a group of 30 to 50 juveniles and young adults.

The 26-year-old was knocked down, stomped on and kicked as the juvenile attackers removed his trousers to rob him.

Mr Widstrand was found on the street, stripped and bleeding from his nose and mouth, and is now in a medically induced coma, battling potentially fatal brain swelling.

The television producer had moved to an apartment in the Minnesota city two months earlier and was working as a for a local community channel.

Speaking at a press conference, his father Peter said Ray had never ‘expressed any concerns’ about living on the East Side.

‘I can't imagine why someone would do this to another person. Hopefully they will at least answer to that,’ Peter Widstrand added.

The large group was fighting on a street located mere blocks from the local police station and turned the violence on Mr Widstrand when he tried to get past them, witnesses told police.

A local newspaper reported that the fight had started at a party nearby and a group of girls had taken it to the street after which the brawl escalated into a bust-up between local gangs.

‘An innocent man was walking down the street and brutally attacked by a group of youth,’ police spokesman Sgt. Paul Paulos, told Pioneer Press.

‘He was out for a walk and decided to go through this group and was assaulted and knocked unconscious.’

According to the police report, Mr Widstrand was hit over the head with a ‘can in a sock’ which knocked him to the ground.

Family support: Ray Widstrand's parents Linda and Peter spoke during a press conference alongside his sister Alice, expressing their shock and disbelief as to why Ray was attacked

Brutal beating: After Mr Widstrand was knocked over one person was seen stomping on his head after which a third stripped him of his trousers to search his pockets

Witnesses reported seeing blood coming from his head after which a second man stomped on his head while a third removed Mr Widstrand’s trousers and the group searched his pockets.

In custody: Isaac Maiden, 19, has been charged with over the attack on Mr Widstrand

Police found Widstrand lying on the ground, bleeding from his nose and mouth, his pants removed and shirt torn, according to a criminal complaint filed by the Ramsey County attorney's office.

Mr Widstrand is reportedly in a critical condition but stable condition and is expected to be brought out of a medically induced coma this week, his sister told PioneerPress.

Family and friends are holding a bedside vigil at Regions Hospital where Mr Widstrand is being treated for potentially fatal brain swelling.

'He's in the most difficult time right now, as far as swelling and cranial pressure. We're in that critical time,' his father said.

Isaac Maiden, 19, has been charged with first-degree assault, first-degree aggravated robbery and crime committed for the benefit of a gang.

He is being held with bail set to $150,000 and is scheduled to appear in court this month.

Maiden denies assault.

A further three male juveniles have been arrested in connection to the attack but no charges have been brought against them.
