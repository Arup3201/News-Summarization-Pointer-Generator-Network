A World Cup in Qatar in Christmas week will be the ruin of English football, they wail.

FIFA must go, they rant like dervishes in the desert.

Boycott it, rave the demented worshippers of the Premier League as the greatest form of the oldest game on the planet – ever.

Such is the gnashing of teeth and tearing of hair here about the date change from summer to winter following the award of 2022 to a Gulf state.

Memories are short in the football blame business.

It is not much more than a year since our national game – from the FA and the Premier League downwards – was in such profound discussion about introducing a mid-winter break to the season that it almost happened.

No-one was worrying about the Christmas and New Year tradition then. Nor that it would bankrupt the English game.

Rather, there was a substantial body of opinion that the rush of festive fixtures was so physically damaging to footballers that it was detrimental to the integrity of our professional Leagues.

Give us a break, cried the majority of our football managers, coaches and players.

Even until this week – when the FIFA task force plumped for the cool of November and December in Qatar seven years from now – Jose Mourinho was virtually a lone voice expressing unbridled enthusiasm for English football’s great Christmas tradition.

Only this January Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers sent Raheem Sterling - his best player who also happens to be England’s brightest prospect – on a two-week holiday to the West Indies so that he might come refreshed for the second half of the season after missing some games.

Of course a winter World Cup will not provide that kind of rest cure for young men apparently jaded by the exertions of playing football a couple of times a week in return for pay packets running into hundreds of thousands of pounds per week.

This, not the Premier League, is the greatest tournament of all and it demands that players scale the heights of skill and endeavour.

But for the English football authorities to protest that the requisite change to the fixture list will put our game at risk of going skint is wretchedly disingenuous.

What this is really all about is that England are miffed about not being given the right to stage either of the next two World Cups - and won’t even be considered for one until the 2030s, at the earliest.

And whatever you may think of President Blatter, that is not FIFA’s fault.

The English bids from 2006 onwards have been absolute disasters.

In those campaigns, the FA showed about as much grasp of what the football world expects of its World Cup Finals hosts as Tony Blair and George Bush of the catastrophic consequences of their over-throwing of Middle East dictators.

Nor were the Premier League of much help at all.

The bids were so bloated with pomposity, arrogance and self-satisfaction – ‘we’ re the greatest, give it to us’ - as to be laughable abroad.

Consciously or not, the English reaction to Qatar amounts to an enraged attempt to bury the memory of those pitiful efforts by inflaming public opinion here against FIFA in general and Sepp Blatter in particular.

This has become simply the default response here to almost everything football.

By and large, however, it may surprise much of our own population that the anti-FIFA criticism is nothing like as vociferous elsewhere.

Even UEFA, with whom the FA and Premier League like to regard themselves allied against the world governing body, have joined the other five Continental federations in approving the move to mid-winter.

Even Luis Figo, one of the puppet challengers to Blatter in the forthcoming presidential election, has given his backing.

Yet in their hysteria to scream foul, England’s football bosses and many of the game’s celebrities are blind to how Christmas in Qatar could actually help us win the World Cup for the first time in half a century.

Phil Neville has taken a great deal of flak as a novice TV pundit but as he shrewdly points out: ‘England normally go into a World Cup at the end of a long season with our players dead on their feet. This might be good for us.’

Not that the Premier League are likely to pay much attention to that.

So perhaps their memory needs jogging that most of the European nations take a midweek break during the festive season and that Germany (one month off), France (three weeks), Spain and Italy (two weeks) have all won the World Cup since Sir Alf, Bobby and the rest of the sunshine boys of ’66. Nor do any of their Leagues appear to be going broke.

Most of the rest of global football’s acceptance of Qatar ’22 does no good at all to England’s self-perceived fall-back position – that of being asked to step in as the alternative venue in the now highly improbable event of Qatar being stripped of the World Cup.

The FA’s only hope left appears to be Russia declaring war on Western Europe before the World Cup goes there in 2018.

That’s how desperate they are.

Dan Topolski – not only a genius rowing coach but a fine man – sadly died last weekend at the ridiculously premature age these days of 69.

A world champion oarsman in his own right – despite his slight build – Topolski coached Oxford to 10 successive Boat Race victories from 1976 to 1985.

Two years later, five star US rowers at the University led a revolt against Topolski and his unorthodox methods: ‘He never trains, he only races.’

What they failed to appreciate was that he was a profound psychologist and supreme analyst who knew how to win.

He sacked the Americans and, against all odds and predictions, sent out his weakened, makeshift crew to beat Cambridge from Putney to Mortlake yet again.

The Yanks went home, dragging their oars behind them.

Topolski authored a renowned book about the mutiny True Blue which was made into a major movie.

He took to journalism, not only as writer but, since 1990, as the most sage and entertaining voice of BBC rowing commentary.

Whenever it fell to me to report rowing – be it on the Thames tideway or the greatest race of all when, at the Athens Olympics, Steven Redgrave won his record fourth gold medal as the UK’s coxless four beat Canada by a fraction of a second – it was Topolski who kindly and patiently marked my card.

Then, when the work was done, we went for a drink.

Shrewd, amusing, generous and engaging company, gentleman Dan will be hugely missed by all who knew him.

A very private funeral will be followed, during this summer’s Henley Regatta, by a memorial service out there beside the great river he loved.
