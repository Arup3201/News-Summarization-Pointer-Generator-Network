Proudly wearing their pristine white kits bearing the red rose, the England rugby union team pose for a photograph before a match against their arch-rivals Scotland in March 2014.

They won the crunch international 16-15 and a month later defeated France to clinch a Grand Slam in the Five Nations Championship.

But after playing for their country, five of this team would go on to die for it - slaughtered in the Great War.

Now their tragic stories have been pieced together in a book commemorating the lives and deaths of every rugby union international killed in the 1914-18 conflict.

Team: Back row, left to right: Alfred Maynard, Arthur Dingle, Bungy Watson, Cyril Lowe, Sidney Smart, G Ward, Joseph Brunton, JE Greenwood. Front row, left to right: William Johnston, Cherry Pillman, HC Harrison, Ronald Poulton-Palmer, Bruno Brown, Francis Oakeley, WJA 'Dave' Davies

The project has been undertaken by 
rugby fan Nigel McCrery, the screenwriter who created the BBC television
 series Silent Witness and New Tricks.

He
 spent two years combing sporting and military records to identify 
players who fought in the 'war to end all wars', which left almost 
908,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers dead.

Lt Alfred Frederick Maynard: Hooker. Died on the first day of Battle of Ancre 1916, having survived being shot in Gallipoli.

Captain Arthur James Dingle: Wing. Killed during disastrous second attack at Scimitar Hill 1915. His body was never found.

Surgeon James Henry-Digby 'Bungy' Watson: Centre. Died when the HMSHawke was sunk by a German submarine in 1914. 500 men perished in attack.

Lt Ronald Poulton­-Palmer: Captain. Died on the Western Front, close to Belgium border in 1914. Reportedly said he would 'never play at Twickenham again' as he died.

Lieutenant Francis Eckley Oakeley: Scrum half. Died on HMS D2 submarine when the vessel was rammed and sunk in 1914.

Some fought at sea or in the air, but many experienced the horror and bloodshed of the trenches on the Western Front.

Mr
 McCrery found 140 players from nine teams who died in battlefield. Most
 were from England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand or 
South Africa but some represented France and the USA.

Of
 the 15 England players pictured in this poignant photograph taken 
before the Calcutta Cup game against Scotland at Inverleith, north of 
Edinburgh, a third did not survive the war.

The
 skipper, Lieutenant Ronald Poulton-Palmer, led an unbeaten side in the 
two season's before the outbreak of war in August 1914.

In
 the last Test match - a 39-13 victory over France in April 1914 - the 
centre scored four tries. He was hailed one of the greatest players in 
the world.

He was killed by a
 sniper close to the Belgian border in 1915, five weeks after arriving 
on the Western Front. It was reported that his last words were, 'I shall
 never play at Twickenham again'.

Surgeon James 'Bungy' Watson, who played centre, served with the Royal Navy on HMS Hawke.

In
 September 1914, the warship was blown up by a German submarine while on
 patrol. She sank in eight minutes, with the loss of  500 men.

Captain
 Arthur 'Mud' Dingle, a flying winger, died during a disastrous attempt 
to capture Scimitar Hill, an offensive during the Battle of Gallipoli, 
in August 1915. His body was never found.

Lieutenant
 Alfred Maynard, who played in the scrum at hooker, died on the first 
day of the Battle of the Ancre in France in November 1916, the final 
large British attack of the bloody Battle of the Somme. He had earlier 
survived being shot in the leg at Gallipoli.

Fallen: 'Bungy' Watson (left) who was one of 500 who died when the HMS Hawke was sunk in 1914. Lt Ronald Poulton-Palmer. Died on the Western Front near to the Belgium border in 1914

And Lieutenant Francis Oakeley, the scrum half, died on HMS D2, a submarine which was sunk by a German warship in 1914.

Brave: Captain Arthur James Dingle. Died Battle of Scimitar Hill 1915

Other
 England rugby internationals killed included burly forward Lieutenant 
Commander Arthur Harrison, a serving naval officer who played against 
Ireland and France that season.

He fought in the sea battles of Heligoland Bight in August 1914 and at Jutland in 1916.

He
 died heroically in 1918 taking part in a raid on Zeebrugge, an 
audacious mission by the Royal Navy to blockade the German-held port.

He
 was killed leading a landing party against heavily-defended enemy 
positions, for which he was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.

Captain
 Robert Pillman played in the France match, replacing his brother, 
Charles, who had broken his leg in the previous game against Scotland.

The
 flanker was killed in July 1916 during the Battle of the Somme, on the 
parapet of a German trench, while trying to bring his men back from a 
night raid.

Mr McCrery 
discovered that some players died of disease, while others, traumatised 
by the conflict, committed suicide. Others survived the conflict went on
 to fight in the Second World War.

He said: 'I have a real interest in the Great War and Rugby Union - both inherited from my father.

'I think it would be a tragedy if, after 100 years, these great men are forgotten.

Killed: 'Bungy' Watson was posted to HMS Hawke (pictured). In September 1914 the ship was blown up and sunk in eight minutes by a German submarine, killing 500

'These
 men tell the story of the war. They fought and died in every service 
and in every country. We can use their stories to remember the 
sacrifices that were made.

'It's
 about not forgetting them. As time goes on it's easy to forget the 
sacrifice they made on our behalf. You do not have to believe in war to 
appreciate sacrifice.

'I 
want people who read the book to realise the effects of war. These were 
exceptional people - not only great players, but intelligent men and 
members of the community who were tragically lost.'

The
 book covers the history of international rugby up to the First World 
War and includes biographies of each player killed, with how and where 
they died and photographs.

* Into Touch: Rugby Internationals Killed In The War will be published by Pen and Sword in January.
