This was the worst yet. A wretched, gruesome numbing defeat that not only leaves an Australian Ashes whitewash very much on but also signals, more than the other three emphatic thrashings, the end of a great era for this England team.

Australia’s easy, no-nonsense eight-wicket victory within four days at the MCG is a new low simply because England threw the game away in the most culpable manner, as shamefully as anything seen in the darkest days of English cricket.

This fourth Test, with the Ashes gone, was meant to be the start of something new for England, the first steps with a clean slate towards attempting to regain the urn when these old enemies meet yet again in just 18 months time.

Dismal: England lost heavily at the MCG to go 4-0 down in the series as they stare a whitewash in the face

All smiles: Chris Rogers (left) made a hundred and Shane Watson a fifty as Australia sauntered to their win

Oops: Alastair Cook dropped two catches - the second an absolute sitter to give David Warner a reprieve

Lonely? Cook's captaincy, particularly his negativity, has come into question during this doomed series

And it was meant to be the start of Alastair Cook taking real control and starting to mould his own England side in his own way, not just following the tried and tested methods of Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower.

Instead England betrayed a collective scrambled state of mind and a complete lack of confidence with a woeful display that sees them, incredulously, 4-0 down against an Australian team who had not won in nine Tests before this series.

England had their chances here far more than they had in Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. Twice they were in position with the bat to finally put pressure on what remains a brittle Australian side only to blow it in as hapless way as can be.

There is no defence for a first innings score of 255, made timidly, after Michael Clarke had gifted them the chance to move into a commanding position by taking a real gamble in asking England to bat.

And there is absolutely no defence for what must surely be the worst day of this tortuous tour, the third of this Test, when England went into Saturday as clear favourites to win only to firstly let Australia’s last pair add 40 and then capitulate recklessly to 179 all out losing the last five wickets for just six runs.

Despite it all England still had hope in the morning session, particularly as Australia have proved themselves very nervous chasers in recent times, but it was quickly distinguished with two terrible fielding howlers in the first half hour.

How different this Test might still have been had Jonny Bairstow gone for the regulation chance to his left offered by Chris Rogers on 19 and then had Cook, perhaps still fazed by his keeper’s poor judgment, not dropped an absolute dolly to reprieve David Warner when he was on 22.

It was a passage of play that highlighted England’s muddled selectorial thinking in bringing Bairstow here as back-up keeper when there are not many who view him as Matt Prior’s successor and then the captain’s scrambled brain.

Stay hit! Chris Rogers was in free-scoring form as he passed fifty in the morning session

Got him! Jonny Bairstow caught Warner off Ben Stokes' bowling but it was too little too late from the tourists

Held aloft: Rogers celebrates his fifty, which came up in 73 balls, and the opener rarely looked threatened

Hero: Rogers was exemplary in scoring a ton and seeing Australia through the majority of their second innings

Top knock: Rogers scored a cluster of his runs backward of square on the offside, as shown by our hawk-eye

Carry on: Shane Watson was in at No 3 and continued where Warner had left off, scoring quick runs at the MCG

Warner, who rarely performs when he is actually under pressure, soon gave it away to give Ben Stokes, the one ray of hope from this series, a deserved wicket but the journeyman Rogers, one of cricket’s nice guys, made England pay.

And England’s body language betrayed a beaten, embarrassed side long before Rogers, missed again by Bairstow on 81, moved on to a popular century and Shane Watson and Clarke, passing 8,000 Test runs, then completed the highest successful run-chase at the MCG in 50 years with contemptible ease.

It is hard to see England raising themselves for one last push after this and if they do indeed lose in Sydney next week this would be a much more humiliating 5-0 reverse than that suffered here in 2006-07.

Back then England had lost the spine of the side that won the Ashes so famously in 2005 and were up against some truly great Australian players, led by Ricky Ponting, who were hell-bent on revenge.

This, at least judging by the last five years, is a much better England side than Andrew Flintoff’s vintage and they are up against an ageing Australian team who had a similar Test record to Zimbabwe in 2013 before England arrived.

Toil: Stokes was England's main threat but even he found it tough going against the unforgiving Aussies

Tried and trusted? Cook opted to go with Joe Root instead of frontline spinner Monty Panesar for long spells

Clearly, though, Cook was right when he said before this match that maybe England’s 3-0 victory last summer had merely papered over the cracks both in the England side and his own captaincy.

England made a habit of claiming the big moments last summer against an Australian side who had seemed to have forgotten how to get over the line but this time it has been Clarke who has had the upper hand in everything he has done.

Big change now seems far more likely at the end of this series than it did after Perth. A lack of energy, imagination, tactical acumen and, yes, heart and desire appear far more worrying here than in the aftermath of losing the Ashes.

Swann has gone, there are question marks over whether Jonathan Trott and Matt Prior will play for England again and there are those like Bairstow, Michael Carberry, Tim Bresnan, Monty Panesar and Chris Tremlett who could conceivably disappear after this tour. And who will remain to coach them is a moot point also.

Crestfallen: Stuart Broad saw an early catch go down and looked a beaten man in the field for the tourists

Smother: Rogers batted sensibly and showed the England middle order how to carry an innings

It is hard, for instance, to see Graham Gooch carrying on as batting coach after this. One of the greatest of all servants of English cricket will surely be too proud to watch the batsmen continually letting him and their country down.

And what Flower would make of a 5-0 reverse is key to what England do next. I remain convinced that there is no-one better equipped to guide England towards a new era than the greatest coach England have had but will Flower feel that he has to be held accountable more than anyone and step down?

There is no appetite within the ECB for Flower to go but new managing director Paul Downton may have a fight to persuade him to stay when he arrives in Sydney to begin a term as managing director that he could never have imagined would start in a crisis such as this when he succeeded Hugh Morris.

Nobody better? England ought to stick by their coach Andy flower despite the humiliation Down Under

Happy as Larry! The Australian tactics had Darren Lehmann's aggressive stamp all over them during this series

There are questions, too, facing a selection panel which has got so much right over the last five years. James Whitaker takes over as national selector having to explain how England have ended up with the wrong back-up keeper, three giant bowlers who could not be trusted to play and three spinners in the squad in Panesar, Scott Borthwick and James Tredwell but no Swann.

It is a sorry old mess and one that has escalated beyond all comprehension over these past few testing weeks. Last time they were at the MCG three years ago they retained the Ashes and did the sprinkler dance in front of a delighted Barmy Army. This same England team have unravelled this time in a most brutal fashion here and the time has clearly come for them to start again.
