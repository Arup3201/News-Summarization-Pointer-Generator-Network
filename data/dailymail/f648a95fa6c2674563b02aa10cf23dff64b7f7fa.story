As Alan Thompson approached his 40th birthday his life was in flux. There were front pages on his private life. Lurid news tales on drink driving.

The loss of his job as Celtic's first team coach five weeks after a 3-0 victory over Rangers in the last Old Firm match led him towards a dark tunnel.

'Aye, I was in a bad place,' he tells Sportsmail. 'I had hurt people, I felt hurt and I just wanted to move on.

'I admit it took me a while to get over what happened at Celtic. It took me 12 months to get over it. I had 12 months of doing virtually nothing.

'I just felt I didn't want to get back involved in football for a long time.

'I took time out after that. I needed it.

'It was the first time since I left school I'd been out of football. That's what, twenty three years? I'd always been in or around a football club. And then….'

For a wet and grey city Glasgow sustains a thriving grapevine. For weeks before his sacking word had it Thompson was living a fuller, more colourful life than Celtic might have liked. The gossip, he says now, was exaggerated.

Friends with Neil Lennon since pairing up at Parkhead at the outset of the Martin O'Neill era the pair socialised together. Thompson was the man to whom the Northern Irishman first confided his battle with depression. Yet when the telephone call came telling him his job was going, Thompson took possession of his own black cloud.

'I took time out back home in Newcastle with the family. I needed that to get myself sorted.

'I felt I couldn't trust many people.

'You start asking questions of yourself as well.

'I stayed clear of the game completely. I was invited to a lot of clubs to watch training and stay involved, but I just didn't want to do it.

'I didn't watch Sky, I didn't lift a paper. I stayed well away from everybody except my family.

'I took some nice holidays, I had some nice breaks. I had lads' golf trips, I did stuff I hadn't had the luxury of doing for a long time and suddenly had the time to do.

'I went to New York for my 40th last Christmas. I couldn't have done all that if I had jumped back in to the game. I needed that time.'

After family, football had been his second love. A father of three Thompson compares the loss of his Celtic job to a break-up. It took the lure of his hometown club to persuade him to dip his toe back in the water.

'A mate of mine has a box at Newcastle and I started going to back to St James' Park,' he remembers. 'I watched them and started doing the things I hadn't done for a while.

'I went to see friends in the game, I got around training grounds.

'Then a chance came up to work at Birmingham with my mate Lee Clark and I felt I couldn't turn it down.

'I asked myself the question and thought about it. Then I said, "you know what? I'm ready now".'

Sipping cappuccino in a restaurant off Blackpool's Bloomfield Road Thompson has stability in his life once more.

The pitch outside is barren and bare, but he has his family back and a job in English football. His own grass is greener than since his sacking two and a half years ago.

'I'm back in the game now and loving the day to day involvement at Blackpool and passing on the knowledge of everything I've learned.'

He will watch Sunday's League Cup meeting between Celtic and Rangers with his 15-year-old son, a curious bystander in the circus of Glasgow life.

'He remembers little bits of life up there and has seen the clips on You Tube, but he has been asking me a few questions recently about it. Why it is how it is, the bigotry and stuff. It's difficult to explain.'

Thompson won four Scottish league titles, three Scottish Cups, two League Cups and reached a UEFA Cup Final.

He spent seven years at Celtic, scoring a goal against Rangers for every season at the club. Uniquely, he also racked up three red cards. All of them at Ibrox.

'There was a red in my very first Old Firm game,' he grimaces. 'The gaffer (Martin O'Neill) nearly ripped my head off after the game.

'He was physically trying to get at me. We were in the game – Rangers had just gone 2-1 ahead and I got sent off and it went 3-1 then 4-1 and finished at five.

'He came at me and I thought, "s**t my Celtic career is finished before it's begun".

'Honestly, the way he was talking to me after the game. Martin could be ruthless when he wanted to be.

'Thankfully I redeemed myself in the next Rangers game at Celtic Park. I scored the only goal of a 1-0 win.'

He pleads guilty to two of the reds, but has a well rehearsed defence for the other.

'The Lovenkrands one (in 2004) was definitely not a red card, I never made contact.

'We didn't even come together and he went down as if someone had taken him out with a sawn off shotgun.

'Funny enough, we ended up working together at Newcastle. We sorted it out.'

The first man to be capped for England while a Celtic player Thompson scored seven goals in Glasgow derbies - as many as Chris Sutton and John Hartson.

'I'm quite proud of that,' he admits.

'I remember smashing one in off the bar over Stefan Klos. Great memories. And Sutty chipping one into the far corner, that's my favourite that one.

'You go into this coaching side of things and people talk about systems, but you realise in teams like that it's not systems that win games.

'Players win games, not systems. We just had good players who knew their roles.

'Chris Sutton's partnership with Henrik wasn't something we worked on in training. It was just two top football players who knew each other's games.

'We had a chemistry as a team.

'You would turn round in the tunnel before a game and say, 'I trust him, I trust him, I trust him.'

'We all lived in and around Glasgow, be it Bothwell or Newton Mearns. You could meet in the city centre. We were a close bunch.'

The bond of trust with Lennon was broken for a time. As his best mucker, trips to the city centre could be a fraught affair.

'It's quite unique in Glasgow,' says Thompson matter of fact. 'There is no place quite like it.

'The importance of football is amazing, it's a massive part of people's lives.

'Sometimes now I miss it.

'I'll sit and watch the Old Firm game on Sunday and think, 'I'd love to be playing in that today.'

'Then you think about the stick and the grief after it and feel relieved you're not involved any longer.

'You have to be careful what you do in that city, there is no hiding place. You have to know that when you are there.

'I never got it like Neil did. There were a few isolated incidents, but what Neil went through was on a different scale. I would have hated that.

'Here in Blackpool it's totally different.'

On a blustery, grey January day there is little pleasure to be had on the legendary beach, yet Thompson's outlook is bright. He left Celtic as player and coach under a cloud, but can speak readily about both now. It's progress of a sort.

'The way it ended for me first time was horrible.

'But, you know, I won four titles and the two I lost was on goal difference and by a point. How bad can that be?'

He wouldn't swap his current existence at the foot of England's Championship for that of Ronny Deila. Thompson looks at the Norwegian and sees an Old Firm novice cursed by a Celtic team with no Larssons, Suttons or Lennons to speak of.

'It's evident to see the fixture doesn't have the same players now. It doesn't take an expert to see that. It's a shame.

'People down here would struggle to name many players at Celtic and Rangers now.

'Gary Hooper is down here now. Victor Wanyama, Fraser Forster, Kris Commons might be looking down here as well. I'm guessing it's been a while since anyone significant at all has come down from Rangers.

'But there's no football place quite like Glasgow. It's a unique city and a unique game for the simple reason that people still care.'
