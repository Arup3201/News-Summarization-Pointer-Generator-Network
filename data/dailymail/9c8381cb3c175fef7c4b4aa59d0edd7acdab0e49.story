The post-date text is always an awkward one.

But if you have have found yourself struggling to compose the perfect message, you are not alone as it has been revealed that British singles spend an average of fourteen and a half minutes writing that first post-date text.

And it is certainly time well spent because, according to the new survey, almost a third of singles surveyed admitted that they would be put off a potential partner based 
on the content of their post-date text.

In the new era of dating, texting is vital and the average Brit spends fourteen and a half minutes composing a post-date text

But be very content cautious as the biggest text turn-off was bad spelling, closely followed by abbreviations (such as gr8 and l8r) and then acronyms such as LOL, ROFL or LMAO.

'Double texting' (not waiting for a reply before sending another text), one word messages and using smiley faces were all also cited as major faux pas for the discerning dater.

The report, carried out by match.com for their upcoming LoveGeist report, also shows that single men are 60 per cent more likely than women to get a friend to check their post-date texts before sending them.

Women believe it is up to their date to send the first post-date text

The burden of post-date ‘textiquette’ is borne mainly by men, with over half of the single women surveyed saying that the first text after a first date is the responsibility of their date.

In fact only 16 per cent of women believe they should take it upon themselves to send the first message.

Match.com’s resident relationship expert, Kate Taylor, said: 'In recent years the way we use technology to communicate after a date has made the post-date follow-up more important than ever.

'Not only do you now need to perform well on the date itself, if your follow-up message isn’t up to scratch, then you might be out of contention for a second meeting.'

Taylor adds: 'Last year’s LoveGeist discovered that one of the best-known rules of modern dating, waiting three days before getting back in touch after a date, was a thing of the past, and this year’s report has again shown how technology is changing how we connect and date.

'The advent of online dating, email and texting has meant that written communication is now more important than ever in impressing a potential partner, which is great news for those fluent in the language of love.'

Do you have ‘Textual Chemistry’? Top tips for staying on message from match.com’s resident relationship expert, Kate Taylor:

1. Texts should be light-hearted and tantalising. Don’t use them for 
outpourings of emotion, whether positive or negative. Instead, regard 
them as the electronic equivalent of a flirty water-cooler moment. A 
cute little way to say, 'great to meet you' and not much more.

2. Be mysterious. Don’t feel obliged to answer every text. In fact, it’s 
better if you don’t, as they will likely just come running back for 
more.

3. Don’t treat 
texts like your Facebook status. Sending texts and picture texts of all 
the fun stuff you’re doing all the time won’t make you look busy and 
popular, it’ll make you look like you’re thinking of messages you can 
send ALL THE TIME, even when you’re out doing fun stuff. That’s not 
healthy.

4. Take it 
one text at a time. Don’t worry if you don’t get a reply straight away! 
And never send a 'Did you get my message?' text. They got it, so forget 
you sent it and get on with your day.

5. Keep it humorous. There’s no need to roll-out the knock-knock jokes, 
but a mushy message written in a funny way is 100 times more appealing 
than one written seriously. And it would be less embarrassing if they 
were to show it to their friends.
