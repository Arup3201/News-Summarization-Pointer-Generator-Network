Worth millions of pounds, it has been dubbed the créme de la créme of string music.

But a Stradivarius could be no more special than a bog-standard violin, according to a new study.

Researchers found the world's leading violinsts could not distinguish between the antique Italian instrument and its cheaper counterpart.

Expensive: Worth millions of pounds, it has been dubbed the créme de la créme of string music. But a Stradivarius violin (pictured) could be no more special than a bog-standard version, according to a new study

This is despite the Stradivarius having a longstanding reputation for being tonally superior to anything you can buy today.

Most musicians even prefer contemporary violins which cost a fraction of the price, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported.

French and U.S. researchers asked ten experts to play 12 violins - six new and the others old, including five by Antonio Stradivari - to find out which were superior.

They blindfolded the participants, before testing them each for an hour and a quarter in a rehearsal theatre, and then again in a 300-seat concert hall.

At the end, six selected a new violin as their preference, with one of them emerging as a clear overall winner.

All of the soloists added that the cheap version was better than their own bespoke instruments.

Violin acoustics expert Professor Claudia Fritz, of the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, and her colleagues caused a storm four years ago when they came up with the same findings in a similar study.

But that study only involved tested six violins in a hotel room, and 21 participants of various levels.

Researchers decided to extend it to include maestros performing in more familiar conditions.

Violins crafted by Antonio Stradivari or Giuseppe Guarneri 'del Gesu' can fetch millions of pounds.

Many violinists truly believe these instruments are better than newly made violins, and several scientists have tried to work out why.

Some have suspected the unusually dense wood, harvested from Alpine spruces that grew during an Ice Age.

Meanwhile, others have pointed the finger at the varnish, or the chemicals that Stradivari used to treat the wood.

But Prof Fritz and study co author Joseph Curtin, who makes violins in Ann Arbor, believe there is no secret because the 'superior' sound is a myth.

Prof Fritz said: 'The violins of Stradivari, Guarneri 'del Gesu', and other Italian makers of the 17th and 18th centuries are widely believed to possess playing qualities that are both immediately discernable to experienced players and not found in new instruments.

'Over the past two centuries, numerous playing and listening tests have challenged this belief by pitting new violins against old.

'Although results often favoured new instruments, the tests typically lacked sufficient rigour for the results to stand as scientific evidence.'

Since the early 19th century, numerous tests have questioned the alleged superiority of the old Italian violins.

Time and time again, listeners have failed to distinguish between the sound of the old and new instruments.

But critics have been quick to pick holes in these studies.

Antique: Antonio Stradivari lived in Cremona between 1644 and 1737 and also crafted cellos, guitars, violas, and harps. It is estimated he made up to 1,100 instruments during his lifetime. Above, a Stradivari violin

In most cases, the listeners were not 
experts, and the players and researchers knew which violin was which - a
 flaw that could have biased the results.

The latest findings claim to have closed these holes.

Prof Fritz said: 'Some studies open new fields for investigation. This study attempts to close a perennially fruitless one, the search for the "secrets of Stradivari".

'Great efforts have been made to explain why instruments by Stradivari and other Old Italian makers sound better than high quality new violins, but without providing scientific evidence that this is in fact the case.

'Doing so requires that experienced violinists demonstrate both a general preference for Old Italian violins and the ability to reliably distinguish them from new ones.

'The current study, the second of its kind again shows that first rate soloists tend to prefer new instruments and are unable to distinguish old from new at better than chance levels.'

Antonio Stradivari lived in Cremona between 1644 and 1737 and also crafted cellos, guitars, violas, and harps.

It is estimated he made up to 1,100 instruments during his lifetime and about 650 survive, including around 500 violins.
