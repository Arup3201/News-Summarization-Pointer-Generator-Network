Controversial QPR footballer Joey Barton is taking his time writing an autobiography sure to cause the same kind of stir as the Roy Keane and Kevin Pietersen books this week.

Barton has spent more than two years on the project — rejecting the manuscripts of two ghost writers and then parting company with publishers Penguin, who wanted to rush out the book for this year’s Christmas market before Barton was ready.

The midfielder, whose desire to gain a wider sporting perspective saw him at the Leaders in Sport conference on Wednesday so he could listen to cycling innovator Sir David Brailsford, is now writing the life story himself.

Barton is talking to other publishers after the fall-out with Penguin but is also examining digital self-publishing and releasing the contents chapter by chapter.

Barton’s first ghost was Times sports writer Matthew Syed but it was felt he had portrayed his views of Barton rather than those of the footballer. Penguin then put forward author Jeff Hudson but his effort read more like a fictional novel to the former Newcastle player.

Now, with the guidance of the head of humanities at Roehampton University, where Barton is studying for a degree in philosophy, the firebrand has completed nine chapters.

The delay has allowed Barton to include his spell at Marseille plus QPR’s return to the top flight and his appearance on Question Time.

Such are the problems at troubled Leeds under owner Massimo Cellino that the English players and the large Italian contingent sit at separate tables for pre-match meals.

The first half of FA chairman Greg Dyke’s England Commission report was derailed by the Premier League vetoing their chairman Anthony Fry being on the panel. But the second edition, to be announced tomorrow, has been notable for the warring bodies working closely for a change. PL chief Richard Scudamore even travelled to St George’s Park to spend three hours addressing the Commission.

The big focus in part two is improving grass-roots facilities and coaching — to be piloted in Sheffield. It is due to be funded by the FA, the Premier League and the Government.

Liverpool are following Manchester United and Manchester City by opening a commercial office in London. But while United are based in plush Mayfair, Liverpool have chosen, like City, to have their satellite operation near Euston railway station. This shortens the commute from the North West.

UEFA 'pirates' snubbed

Jeffrey Webb has welcomed UEFA’s plan to play pre-season tournaments outside Europe

UEFA’s plan to play pre-season tournaments outside Europe, revealed by Sports Agenda, has been welcomed by Jeffrey Webb, the president of the CONCACAF federation that governs the favoured host countries in North America.

But Tim Leiweke, the Los Angeles Galaxy owner who took David Beckham to the USA, is not in favour, claiming European clubs want to ‘take money out of that landscape’.

Leiweke’s brother Tod, CEO of Tampa Bay Sports, also questioned whether it was a ‘pirate move’ by UEFA at Leaders in Sport.

Meanwhile, Webb’s admirable stance on the racism scandal of Chelsea’s black youth coach Eddie Newton not getting near any managerial openings would have more credence if the FIFA anti-discrimination task force Webb heads had met in the last calendar year.

It makes sense for England to play home matches around the country when Wembley will only be half full for the visit of San Marino on Thursday. But that will have to wait until the FA negotiate a more flexible contract with Wembley from 2017. The FA are prioritising a full NFL franchise at Wembley, which could see England games played elsewhere. However, American football taking precedence over association football seems bizarre.

Manchester City, whose women play Arsenal Ladies in the FA’s Continental Cup final at Wycombe a week today, are angry the game is being staged so close to London and aggravated by the FA not responding to their complaints. The FA say the venue was chosen months ago.
