Trauma: Faye Smith (right) told how she broke down the bathroom door within seconds when her 12-year-old daughter Gabrielle did not respond to any knocks or calls

A mother has spoken out about the heart-wrenching moment she battered down the bathroom door to save her 12-year-old daughter from drowning in the bath, but she was too late.

Faye Smith, 47, smashed the wooden door in seconds after Gabrielle failed to respond to her knocks and calls.

But when she got to the tub, the little girl was motionless under the water.

An inquest at Sheffield Coroner’s Court heard Gabrielle, known as Gabi to her friends, had suffered a violent seizure the previous year.

She was diagnosed with non-epileptic attack disorder - which causes seizures, black-outs, collapsing and loss of bladder control.

Despite Gabi’s condition, Mrs Smith was told her daughter could take a bath and cross roads without assistance.

Mrs Smith, who also has a 16-year-old son, Zach, told the inquest Gabi's best friend Rebecca was at the house in Sheffield, Yorkshire, when the incident happened.

She said: 'I was sitting with my son and having a cup of tea, then Rebecca knocked on my door and said: "Faye, Gabi has been in the bathroom for ages".

'Zach and I looked at each other. I jumped off the bed and ran into the corridor.

'I was shouting through the bathroom 
door: "Gabi, talk to me, I’m worried about you. I’m breaking this door 
down if you don’t talk to me".

Tragic: The little girl from Sheffield had been diagnosed with non-epileptic attack disorder a year before

Angelic: Gabrielle, known as Gabi, had just had a sleepover with her best friend and was planning to meet another classmate that day. The inquest heard her father died three years ago, which affected her moods

'I took several steps back and I kicked the door down in seconds.'

Faye, a communications consultant, said Gabi’s moods had suffered following the death of her father three years ago in May.

'She had said on several occasions she wanted to be with her dad again,' said Faye.

Family: Brother Zach, 16, pictured with Gabi on holiday, rushed to help his mother break the door when his sister's friend said she had been in the bath for a long time

'But I explained that meant that she would be dead too, and I said she was very much loved and adored, and if she died that would be two tragedies.

'But on that weekend she was bright and cheerful.

'What Gabi loved was having her friends around her, especially her best friend.'

Assistant Coroner Louise Slater recorded a narrative verdict that Gabi died as a result of drowning.
