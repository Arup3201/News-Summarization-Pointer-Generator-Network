A touching video has shown the moment a two-year-old boy was reunited with his mother after she underwent three weeks of chemotherapy.

Laura Martancik, a single mother from Hawaii, was first diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in July 2013 and went into remission for three months before the cancer returned in September.

After the diagnosis, she moved to Connecticut with her son James to live with her sister while she underwent grueling treatment and a stem cell transplant at Yale Cancer Center.

She recently stayed at hospital for three weeks and when she was reunited with her son, her sister caught their sweet embraces on camera.

Joy: Laura Martancik opens her arms to her son James after arriving home from three weeks of chemo

A video of the moment they were reunited has been shared to Martancik's YouTube page.

It shows her smiling as James runs and throws his arms around her before holding onto her tightly with a big grin for the camera.

She then puts him on the ground and he backs up - before taking another running leap towards her as he giggles.

They repeat their game several more times, with both mom and son reveling in the moment.

'What did I tell you?' Martancik tells the little boy. 'Mommy always comes back! I'm all back from the doctor.'

Speaking to Today.com, she explained how she had undergone six days of nonstop 'gnarly, insane crazy chemo' after being admitted to the hospital on New Year's Eve.

The intense treatment prepared her body for the stem cell transplant, she said.

For the entirety of her stay, all she could think about was her son.

'When you're sitting there alone, you feel like you're never going to make it and all you want to do is be home with your baby,' she said.

Being reunited with him was 'the best feeling in the world', she said.

She has now returned to the hospital and is undergoing tests, but she told Today.com she hopes that if other patients undergoing chemo see her video, they'll know that they'll make it through.

'It's really important to stay positive and to stay happy,' she said. 'People need to know you do make it out, you really do get to go home.'

Now she is looking forward to returning back to Hawaii, she said.

On Tuesday, one of her friends, Erica Bartol, wrote a blog post about sitting with Martancik as her hair was shaved off - and her joy when the task was finally completed. 

'She continues to fight,' she wrote. 'And I believe she will. And she will get through this for her son James. And for herself. And when she’s back thriving in Hawaii I will come visit her and say, "Remember when?"' 

Martancik has set up a gofundme page to continue to raise funds for her treatment.
