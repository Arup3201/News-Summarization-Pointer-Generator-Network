Los Angeles Times reports the Oklahoma woman was seen in the area of South Beach Boulevard and Ball Rd in the days before her death, which authorities describe as a prostitution and trafficking hotspot.

Police believe she was killed somewhere in southern California but no suspects have been identified.

'The unusual manner in how she was found makes us believe she was murdered,' Lt. Tim  Schmidt,  Anaheim Police Department spokesman, said.

'We're looking for the last person who may have had contact with her prior to her death.'

Last night, Oklahoma nonprofit No Boundaries International which works with sex workers held a candlelight vigil for Estepp, who was known to outreach workers by her street name, 'Sarah'.

NBI president Lori Basey said the charity first encountered Estepp selling her body while pregnant on South Robinson Ave in Oklahoma, an area commonly known for prostitution, sometime between 2011 and 2012.

Basey told News Channel 4 outreach workers often tried to help Estepp, whose past was deeply troubling.

'In 2012, it was just on a routine occurrence when she was in this area that we would run into her,' she said.

'Numerous times our street outreach team were standing with her, talking to her, praying with her as she was out there. During that particular time in 2012, she was pregnant.'

JohnTV.com reported Estepp had three misdemeanor convictions for street prostitution in Oklahoma in 2012. One of the cases was a direct result of Estepp being caught 
on video by Bates.

It is not known when the heavily-tattooed woman moved to California, however she was arrested in Elk City, Oklahoma on a larceny charge in January of this year.
