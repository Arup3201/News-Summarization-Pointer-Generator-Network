Steve Irwin's son is carrying on his animal-loving legacy at the tender age of ten.

Robert was just three years old when his father, the lauded wildlife conservationist, was killed by a sting ray.

Now, seven years on, he is joining his older sister Bindi, 15, in their bids to become the next 'wildlife warriors'.

Celebration: Robert Irwin marked his tenth birthday by feeding fish to salt water crocodiles in Australia Zoo

Flashback: Steve Irwin holds Robert - just a month old in this picture - in one arm as he feeds a 13 foot crocodile in January 2004

Celebrating his tenth birthday in Australia Zoo, he marked the occasion by feeding his first ever saltwater crocodile.

It is a step up from handing fresh fish to more mild water crocodiles.

Flanked
 by his mother, Terri, sister, and friends, the young Irwin thanked 
onlookers for their support after completing the challenge.

There was even a Father Christmas there to complete the festive occasion.

Robert was guided by zookeepers as he entered the pen to face the giant tetrapod.

Ecstatic: His mother Terri embraced him as sister Bindi, 15, gave him a birthday message

Warm up: He started by feeding a water crocodile at the festive event put on for his birthday

Step up: It was then to tackle the more dangerous, bigger and menacing salt water crocodile

Advice: He was guided by a keeper at the zoo, who helped him gauge how to get around the giant tetrapod

Warming up by feeding a small water crocodile, he then darted and crouched around the park clutching fish as he gauged the best way to approach its larger, more aggressive cousin.

When it came to throwing the food, he spun it with confidence inches in front of the crocodile, which took it and scarpered.

His family rushed forwards to give him a hug as the crowd cheered.

As a baby, his father was pictured feeding a crocodile while holding him in the other arm.

Tactics: With fish in hand, the pair darted around the pen to get in the right position for the difficult task

The moment: When it came to throwing the fish, Robert did it artfully and landed the food inches in front

Success: Delighted, Robert shared a joke with another conservationist before thanking onlookers for support

Family: The trio, determined to continue Steve's legacy, spoke to fans after the event and beamed at cameras

At the time the pictures caused worldwide controversy from people who were shocked that a baby so young had been put in such close proximity to a dangerous animal.

But it seems as young Robert has grown up around the creatures, he has developed little fear for them.

Steve was killed in September 2006 after getting stung by a stingray while filming in Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

He was setting up to shoot ocean reef footage at the time for a show that would include segments with his daughter Bindi.

The Irwin family have always vowed to carry on Steve's work.

At the age of 12, Bindi was promoting a new line of books in her Wildlife Adventures series.

Last month, she opened up about her father, the 'wildlife warrior', saying: 'He was the greatest dad on the planet.'

Attributing
 his success to his genuine and unrivalled love for the animals he 
worked with, Bindi said her father has inspired her and Robert to 
dedicate their lives to nuturing zoo animals.

Emerging: In July, Bindi celebrated her 15th birthday by paving the way to a career in wildlife conservation

Then: Robert was just three, and Bindi was eight, when their father Steve was killed by a stingray
