Manny Pacquiao achieved a points victory of extraordinary dimensions  in Macau but not the first knock out in six years which he so mightily desired.

The six knock-downs he inflicted on a road-runner in reverse called Chris Algieri thrilled the packed south-east Asian crowd in the CotaiArena but were not quite enough to finish off the American.

New York’s holder of degrees in medicine and nutrition looked after his health through 12 rounds spent going backwards so fast and so far that if they had taken out the ropes he would have backed himself into the car park of the Venetian casino.

Manny Pacquiao  dominated his fight with Chris Algieri from the first bell and won convincingly 

Pacquiao was on top of Algieri from the first bell but was unable to stop the fight early 

Mere survival is not enough in a world title fight. So perhaps Algieri’s real achievement was that of preventing the PacMan from sending him so far into oblivion that it may have frightened Floyd Mayweather from ever agreeing to the richest fight in ring history.

Team PacMan had considered carrying Algieri a few rounds so as not to look too devastating on television back in Mayweather’s home town of Las Vegas.

As it transpired, Algieri did that job for him by being fit enough to run a marathon while facing the wrong way and - well, yes - brave enough to keep getting up every time Pacquiao bowled him over.

So when he was asked if him against Mayweather might finally happen, the PacMan was able to say: ‘Yes, I want that fight and the fans deserve it.’

He praised Algieri for regaining a vertical position once in the second round, twice in the sixth, twice more in the eighth and once again in the ninth.

His fabled trainer Freddie Roach disagreed with that assessment, saying: 'All he did was run. He showed none of the guts that got him off the canvas to win his light-welter title against Ruslan Provodnikov.'

Algieri was stripped of that belt the second the first bell rang here, for accepting this catch-weight fight for Pacquiao’s world welterweight title.

Where he goes from here after a performance trying to smother the life out of a major television event is anybody’s guess.

But Pacquiao is still on course for a date with destiny and a large share of a potential one-billion dollars purse in Las Vegas, Money Mayweather agreeing.

Even though Algieri refused to join the party, Pacquiao was able to demonstrate that his punching power is almost regenerated to the level which destroyed our own Ricky Hatton in 2008.

The heaviest knock down was the first of the two in the sixth. Somehow Algeiri made it to the bell even though it could easily have been stopped then by the referee, his own corner... or one more blow of that magnitude from Pacquiao.

Reminded that he had questioned the power of the PacMan, he graciously conceded: ‘He’s a great fighter. He does everything well.’

As for himself, he did so little that I concurred with the judge who gave Pacquiao every round, in addition to the knock-down deductions, on a 120-102 card. The two other judges scored it 119-103.

The crowd did not care either way. Inside the arena they squealed to the rafters every time the Filipiino idol landed. Outside, the thousands waiting to see Pacquiao roared their approval.

And it was still lunchtime here as we all emerged into the sunshine of another PacMan victory.

Pacquiao entered the ring to the strains of Queen's ‘We Will Rock You.’ Once he had knelt to pray in a corner and announcer Michael Buffer had told us to get ready to rumble, the roars of ‘Manny, Manny’ filled the packed CotaiArena. 

Then began his pursuit of the American, who was clearly intent on backpedaling behind his naturally longer jab.

Despite his five-inch height advantage, however, Algieiri was not landing with that jab and Pacquiao caught up with him often enough to win the round. 

Algieri was in full flight as Pacquiao stepped up the pace, although when he found the canvas early in the second he claimed it was slip. But referee Genaro Rodriguez ruled a knock-down.

Still the medical graduate from New York’s Long Island had not landed a punch of note as the PacMan took the second 10-8.

Roach had predicted that Algieri would run and he was being proved right. The American was surviving but showing no sign yet of trying to win the fight as he slipped four points behind by the end of the third round.

Algieri was able to land some punches - but not enough to put Paquiao in any danger of losing the fight

Algieri was blocking a proportion of Pacquiao’s punches but, despite his height, was mostly out of reach the few he threw himself. He was also beginning to look even more apprehensive as one or two heavier shots landed.

It takes two to tango and Algieiri did take a couple of tentative steps forward at the start of the fifth. But once he was hit by a left he went on the retreat again, covering up and crouching whenever Pacquiao cut off his space. One punch he did get through with was low. He was warned for that and for wrestling.

Algieri was using his right hand almost exclusively to protect himself against Pacquiao’s deadly left hook. But the first big one got through and down he went again. A third knock-down followed, this time from a wicked right straight through the middle of his guard but he survived the round.

Algieri is the ring’s self-nutritionist and was certainly a fit enough athlete. But you can’t escape everything the PacMan throws and he was rocked by a crisp right as even the faintest chance of winning on points disappeared completely.

As well as going into reverse, Algieri bought more time by complaining about imagined illegalities. The referee was having none of it but, Pacquiao, ever the gentleman, kept giving him a few seconds to recover, en route to winning yet another round.

What was becoming a tedious exercise in frustration exploded with a trade-mark left from Pacquiao which put Algieri flat on his back. He staggered back to his feet only to be floored again. Arguably it should have been stopped as Pacquiao went for the kill but the reeling challenger made it to the final bell.

Algieri’s corner sent their man back out to take more punishment. He was fighting – or rather not really fighting – in a fog now and down he went again from another of those lefts.

Despite his total dominance, time was running out for Pacquiao to deliver the first knock out in the six years since he demolished Hatton – and which he was desperate to give his south east Asian fans. Blows which would have finished anyone who came to fight were just about ridden by Algieri as bac-pedaled.

And so towards the finishing tape which Algieri was so anxious to reach – even though he was losing by as enormous a margin as there has ever been in boxing. Survive he did – but at a cost to his own reputation.

The delusional state of Team Algieri is revealed by quotes from his old kick-boxing now world- title- boxing trainer, Tim Lane, overheard in the corner between rounds:

End of round three, after first knock downs: ‘You’re doing beautiful man. Keep it up.’

End of round 3, after first knock downs: ‘You’re doing beautiful man. Keep it up.’

End of round seven, following another knock-down: ‘This is where we want to be.’

During round nine, seconds before the heaviest knock down: ‘Chris is going to put him to sleep in a few minutes.’

End of round nine: ‘We are exactly where we need to be.’ (Presumably flat on his back.)

End of round 10: ‘Chris,I’m letting you out of the cage.’

End of round 11, at 17 points behind with one round to go: ‘Hit him in the body and stay on his ass. This is The Chris Algieri Show.’
