It wasn't the gung-ho attacking display watching Manchester United fans will have been hoping for, but Luke Shaw's mature performance for England's Under 21 side on Tuesday night showed signs of promise. 

Not least because he was able to get another 90 minutes of competitive football under his belt in only his fourth appearance of the season. Two for United and two for Gareth Southgate's side.

Shaw helped England's young Lions emerge victorious against Croatia on both occasions, with back-to-back 2-1 wins earning them a place at next year's European Championships.

But for Shaw it was more important than just securing tournament next summer. He needed playing time as he fights for full fitness and a regular place in Louis van Gaal's starting XI.

He did his chances of nailing down a spot at Old Trafford no harm in Vincovki, dealing with his defensive duties with ease while trying to show off the natural attacking side of his game.

After 15 minutes he used his considerable pace to drive into space down England's left side when the ball made its way into central midfield. He got hold of it inside Croatia's defensive third moments later and immediately looked up in the hope of delivering a quality cross. His execution was poor but his intentions were always positive.

Always in an advanced position when England were on the ball, Shaw already looks well-suited to a left wing back role should Van Gaal opt to bring back the preferred 3-5-2 formation he used at the start of the campaign.

Surprisingly Shaw didn't see much of the ball in opening period, with much of England's attacking play coming down the right and Croatia choosing to try and open up their opponents through the middle. 

But after 36 minutes he burst into life after Ben Gibson's headed clearance fell to him on the edge of England's box. First he showed a clever touch to lift the ball over an onrushing Croatian player's head, before sprinting into the opposition's half, cutting back and finding a team-mate. The move ended with a Nathan Redmond shot being well saved.

Although he was the victim of a nutmeg early in the second period, Shaw looked calm when faced with Croatian attackers wanting to do his side harm. He dealt with lively substitute and goalscorer Marko Livaja shortly after his embarrassing moment, clearing the ball for a throw-in in one of few tests of his defensive qualities. 

He was back at the other end shortly afterwards, cutting inside and finding himself in the middle of Croatia's penalty area. His short pass found Berahino, whose low shot was easily blocked.

Another show of pace and neat backheel to Hughes followed, before a clever ball down the side of Croatia's defence allowed Harry Kane to drive into the box and win a late corner.

Whether it was Croatia looking deflated after Will Hughes' winning goal, or simply a belief in his own ability, Shaw looked increasingly confident as the game went on, bringing the ball out of defence, stopping to take a look around and laying it off and dropping back into position.

Like most players on the pitch he looked tired towards the end, but that's to be expected given the injury lay-off which has limited his action so far this season. A few more games like this and he'll be up to speed for both club and country.
