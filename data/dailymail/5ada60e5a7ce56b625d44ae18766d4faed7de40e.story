Chris Eubank Jnr has failed to meet Billy Joe Saunders ultimatum to  sign a contract for their proposed fight on November 29 by 5pm on Thursday.

The fight was announced earlier this month as chief support to Dereck Chisora's rematch with Tyson Fury at the Excel Arena in London.

But Eubank Jnr failed to show at a press conference, forcing Saunders to issue an ultimatum which the Hatfield middleweight later revealed on Facebook had not been met.

Billy Joe Saunders offered an ultimatum which Chris Eubank Jnr has failed to meet

At the press conference on Thursday morning, Saunders said: 'He’s had the contract since the first week in September, I’m the champion here and the only reason he’s got a shot here and a chance is because of his big mouth and everybody wants to see him get knocked out, and that’s what I will do to him.

'I’ve booked flights to go away, I’m going away on a training camp, spending a lot of money to bring people in, nutritionists, everything I need to prepare 100 per cent for this fight, and you’ve got him keeping messing around with contracts, changing money, changing loads of stuff.

'He’s had loads of time for it, the way I look at it I’m going to move on after today; if he’s not willing today to sign the contract, by 5pm tonight, I’m going to move on to something different.

Frank Warren, boxing promoter, appeared with Saunders at a press conference on Thursday afternoon

'I haven’t got time to be waiting around for bums, that’s all he is. He hasn’t boxed anybody yet he still talks like he’s a world champion.

'He hasn’t got a name, he hasn’t got a belt, he hasn’t done a 10-rounder, he refused a British eliminator, and now he’s had his chance to fight me and he’s ducking and diving.'

Promoter Frank Warren, meanwhile, insisted he had agreed a deal in principle.

He said: 'I thought I had an agreement with his manager, and his father Chris Eubank Snr; every time we’ve spoken things have changed, it’s not got to the stage where the contracts which we forwarded have been signed.'

Eubank Jnr later tweeted: 'Frank Warren has tried to force me into signing a contract without my lawyers being able to look at it entirely and agree on it.

'He scheduled a press conference before the contract was even looked at properly to try and rush us into signing and agreeing on terms we don't want. 

'There's no deadline or rushing when it comes to my career. I'll sign once my management team has gone through and ok'd the contract completely.'
