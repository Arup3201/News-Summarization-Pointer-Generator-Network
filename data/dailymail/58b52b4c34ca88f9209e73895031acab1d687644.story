A message posted on the Florida teen's Facebook page today read: 'It is with a heavy heart that we share with all of you that Talia has earned her wings at 11:22am. Please lift her beautiful soul, her beautiful light to heaven.'

Since the news broke dozens of fans have taken to Twitter to offer their condolences including Ellen DeGeneres, Miley Cyrus, Kendall Jenner and Justin Bieber.

Natural beauty: Talia Joy Castellano, who charmed America with her YouTube make-up tutorials and became an honorary face of CoverGirl, has died aged 13 following a six year battle with cancer

Talia was first diagnosed with 
stage four neuroblastoma cancer, a tumor that develops from nerve tissue
in infants and children, on Valentine's Day in 2007 when she was just seven years old.

Following
chemotherapy, surgery and radiation she was cancer-free for one year 
but in September 2008 doctors found the disease had spread to a 
small lymph node near her heart.

For
the next four years she received various treatments, but after periods 
of remission the cancer kept on returning to other parts of her body.

Step-by-step: The youngster's YouTube tutorials attracted more than 39million hits

Inspirational eyes:  Talia, who was first 
diagnosed with with stage four neuroblastoma cancer on Valentine's Day 
in 2007,  said that make-up helped to boost her confidence

Last year, on one of her famous YouTube video, she revealed that she had neuroblastoma and leukemia at the same time.

Doctors
suggested a bone marrow transplant as a possible remedy but Talia 
decided forgo another painful surgery and enjoy her remaining days.

Talk show star, Ellen DeGeneres, previously cited the youngster as an inspiration.

'Having a YouTube channel, inspiring people. . . the journey of having cancer was amazing. But every journey has an end'

While interviewing her last October on her eponymous daytime show, Ms DeGeneres stopped to say: 'You really are quite something.

'There's a depth to your soul that is not a 13-year-old soul.

'You’re an old soul and you are very 
special and amazing, and I’m so honored that you wanted to meet me and 
that I got to meet you.'

Learning that Talia had passed away this
morning, the TV personality Tweeted: 'I met a very special girl, and 
today we lost her. Sending my heart to Talia's family. I'm so sad.'

In
one of her YouTube tutorials Talia, who would have turned 14 on August 18, explained that she didn't 
wear wigs because they made her feel 'fake and 'just not me'.

Messages of condolence: Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres had met the teen numerous times

Great loss: The news of Talia's death has touched thousands of her fans around the world  

Instead, 
she used make-up as a confidence booster and her upbeat and entertaining video tutorials went on to attract millions of hits.

Desiree Castellano, Talia's mother, who supported her daughter's decision to forgo surgery, told 
Florida's Blood Centers in 2010: 'She made bald beautiful. She's a gorgeous girl, everyone's telling her, "you look gorgeous without 
any hair!"'

'She just tries to live every day to the fullest, Talia's a Leo, she's a fighter,' Mrs Castellano added.

Celebrity following: Talia met Miley Cyrus at the iHeartRadio music festival last October

Making her mark: A teary Talia was announced as an honorary CoverGirl on the Ellen show

Mutual admiration: The teenager, who developed 
an interest in make-up seven  years ago, when she was first diagnosed with 
neuroblastoma, was as in awe of Ellen as the host was of her

In awe: At the time, Talia had no idea Ellen would surprise her with her very own CoverGirl poster

More than 759,110 people subscribed to the teen's YouTube page to watch her bubbly and expert tips.

'When I put on my make-up I feel 
like I can embrace those features that I really like about myself,' she explained last year.

'I 
feel if someone's looking at me, they're looking at my makeup, not 
looking at my bald head. I am just trying to make young girls, young
adults, adults, anyone, feel beautiful by using makeup.'

Cancer fighter: Talia was diagnosed with neuroblastoma and leukemia 'at the same time' in 2012, giving her only four months to one year to live

Once a week, while enduring 
chemotherapy, radiation, stem cell transplants, and blood transfusions, 
she would teach her viewers how to master a make-up look that most girls are
quick to put in the 'too hard basket'.

'Just fill [the base layer] in sloppily,' she advised on one popular video. 'But focus on 
the eyelid because that's where we want most of the intensity and the 
yellow to stick.

'When you're using very vibrant colors like this you
always want to use a base. One, it will prevent creasing, and it will 
give the eyeshadow something to stick to,' she explains of a look inspired by fire and her 'fiery' bathing suit.

She also told her fans that 'it's just for fun'.

'I just did this while my parents were in the pool and I was really bored. It's
not hard at all. Some girls think it's so hard, being like "How do you 
do that?!" and I'm like "bro, it's"..never mind,' she trails off.

The Orlando, Florida native, who lived with her supportive parents and her older sister, Mattia Joyce, told MailOnline that clothes also helped to lift her spirits and some of her 
favorite looks included 'preppy', 'rocker' and 'boho chic'.

Earlier
this year, Talia fulfilled her dream of becoming a fashion designer as she
collaborated on a line of clothing for teenagers called That Bald Chick
with Los Angeles-based designer, Urbana Chappa.

Ms Chappa, who runs a womenswear 
label called Maison De Urbana, decided to help fulfill Talia's ambitions
after hearing her inspirational story on the Ellen show last fall.

Always smiling: Talia told MailOnline that clothes also helped to lift her spirits and some of her favorite looks included 'preppy', 'rocker' and 'boho chic'

Fiery fighter: The teen had been fighting cancer for seven years, but turned her harrowing story 
into an inspiration for thousands of young girls who tuned into her make-up tutorials

Finishing touches: Talia told her fans that 
'it's just for fun', explaining she did this particular make-up tutorial while her 
parents were in the pool and she ' was really bored'

End result: Although Talia was fighting cancer, she promised her fans she would continue her YouTube channel 
and make-up tutorials

She flew to Florida on April 15 to 
meet the teen at the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando and help 
bring her design ideas to life.

Ms
Chappa, who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 19 but 
successfully overcame the disease, explained that meeting Talia was an 
experience 'I'll never forget.'

She told MailOnline:  'Even though she was sick in the hospital, we made the best of our time. We talked, sketched, worked on her line. I wanted nothing more to keep her legacy alive.'

Family time: The three Castellano women took a tropical break while ticking a few things of Talia's bucket list

Ms Chappa is now hoping to get a major retailer to pick up the fashion collection in Talia's memory.

Doctors estimated last summer that Talia had around four to 12 months left to live.

Looking at things in a positive light, she explained in one of her videos: 'I've gotten so many benefits from [cancer].

Best friends: Misty Sheridan posted this picture of Talia with the caption 'my bestfriend forever @taliajoy18 girly poo you are my sister!'

Perfectly polished: Talia used make-up as a confidence booster and her upbeat and entertaining video tutorials went on to attract millions of hits

Barely there: Talia wasn't afraid to show the effects of chemotherapy, as well as how much fun make-up could be; she hoped her openness would help other young cancer suffers

'Having
a YouTube channel, [inspiring] people and having people look up to me .
. . the journey of having cancer was amazing. But every journey has an 
end.'

Her sister, Mattia Joyce, tweeted earlier today: 'I know you loved tweeting so this tweet is for you @TaliaJoy18 love you forever I will see you in a blink of an eye!!'
