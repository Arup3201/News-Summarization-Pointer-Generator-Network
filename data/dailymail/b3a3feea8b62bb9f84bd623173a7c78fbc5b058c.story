The seven-year-old grandson of a prominent anti-supermarket campaigner was rushed to hospital after a Tesco sign fell on his head.

Edward Sant was standing outside a Tesco Express store in Brixham, Devon, when a section of the sign fell off and hit him.

The schoolboy suffered a gash to the back of his head and was later taken to hospital for treatment.

Edward was visiting grandfather Robbie Robinson, who is leading local opposition against plans for a £20million Tesco superstore nearby.

Mr Robinson, one of the store chain’s most vocal critics, said: 'When I heard what happened to my grandson the irony wasn’t lost on me.

'It is ironic that a Tesco sign should fall on my grandson when I have been opposed to their scheme for so long.'

Edward’s mother Amanda, 43, said: 'Edward was hit right at the base of the neck. It punctured the skin. It was quite a deep wound.

Broken: A section of plastic underneath one of the letters in 'express' fell on the schoolboy's head. It was later reattached by the store manager

'The staff were really good and looked after Edward until the paramedics arrived. I spoke to the store manager.

'He told me he would personally go up on a ladder to fix the sign up so it doesn’t happen again.'

His father Jake, 62, said: 'All I heard was this noise. I turned round and this sign had fallen on Edward’s neck. It punctured his shoulder. I think I went into shock too.'

Store manager Peter Hawes said he has now fixed the section of plastic underneath one of the letters in Express.

He said: 'It was myself and two colleagues who went out and helped. We brought him (Edward) back and he had a nasty gash to his shoulder. It was all sorted out fairly quickly and I went up myself and saw to the sign.'

Brixham Residents Against a Tesco Superstore have been fighting plans to build a 32,000 sq ft Tesco supermarket, 11 town houses and three flats.
