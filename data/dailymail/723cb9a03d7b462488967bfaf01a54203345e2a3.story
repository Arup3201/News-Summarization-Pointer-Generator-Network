Italians have attacked their government for failing to protect the Medieval port city of Genoa after floods there killed one man and left the streets caked in mud.

The city's archbishop and Italy's biggest daily newspaper blasted the 'shameful' failures over the torrent - which comes less than three years after a similar disaster in Genoa killed seven people.

Some parts of the northern city have seen two thirds of a year's rainfall in 72 hours, hurling cars into each other and reducing public services to chaos as the cleanup cost is estimated at £157million.

Destruction: Floods in Genoa, Italy, have killed one man and left the city's streets full of filthy water and mud

Anger: Italy's biggest daily newspaper attacked the government's 'shameful' failure to prevent the disaster

Disaster: The cleanup costs have been put at £157million - not including private individuals and insurance firms

Corriere della Sera, Italy's biggest daily newspaper, attacked the government by announcing in its front page headline yesterday: 'The mud of Genoa, shame of a country'. 

And Archbishop of Genoa Angelo Bagnasco called for a 'timely
and massive' action by the government to resolve the crisis and
prevent similar disasters in future.

'Everyone knows what their responsibilities are,' he said,
his clothes spattered with mud after a tour of the city.

'It's absurd and shameful that bureaucracy of any kind
should be blocking funds which are absolutely necessary for
resolving these problems,' he said. 

Last night authorities warned the disaster could get worse with heavy rain predicted until Monday.

Mess: The Bisagno river burst its banks on Thursday night, leaving the streets strewn with debris and mud

Power of nature: The floods wrecked cars and smashed through shop windows in the Medieval port city

Parked: Genoa is vulnerable because it sits between the sea and a ring of steep mountains with heavy rain

'What is really alarming is how little has been done in three years to make Genoa secure from another flooding disaster,' said Francesco Vincenzi, president of ANBI, anational association for water safety organisations

Governor Claudio Burlando said the estimated damage to public
infrastructure was 200million euros (£157million) - not including all the costs to be borne by private landowners and insurance firms.

Franco Gabrielli, the head of the civil protection authority, added: 'We are still in full emergency.

'The forecasts for the next few hours offer no relief at all for
tomorrow and Monday.'

He admitted that authorities had failed to predict the huge
volume of rain.

Parts of
the city, where the average rainfall is just over 1,000mm a year, saw 700mm in 72 hours.

But Mr Gabrieli criticised delays in reinforcing the banks of the
Bisagno river, the biggest in Genoa, which burst its swollen
banks late on Thursday night.

Civil protection chief Franco Gabrielli said: 'We are still in full emergency. The forecasts offer no relief at all'

Archbishop of Genoa Angelo Bagnasco said: 'It's absurd and shameful that bureaucracy should block funds'

Streets of mud: Parts of the city, where average rainfall is just over 1,000mm a year, saw 700mm in 72 hours

Critics say Italy has failed to protect Genoa from the elements. One major flood defence project was pulled

Volunteers: Residents of the northern city have pulled together to begin clearing the streets despite more rain

He added it was a 'scandal' that 35million euros set aside for the work after the 2011 floods had
not been spent because of a legal dispute. 

Genoa's position between the
sea and a ring of steep mountains has made it particularly vulnerable to
storms and floods.

But critics say successive governments have been mired in bureaucracy and failed to approve proper flood defences or building regulations.

Italy's economic crisis has also seen much public spending pared to the bone. 

'What is really alarming is how little has been done in
three years to make Genoa secure from another flooding
disaster,' said Francesco Vincenzi, president of ANBI, a
national association for water safety organisations.

He added: 'The problem of water security in Italy isn't mainly to do
with resources, it's about political will and bureaucracy'. 

Digging in: Authorities have warned the rain is set to continue until Monday and could cause more flooding

Effort: Thousands of people emerged from the cleanup effort covered in mud, including Genoa's archbishop

Italy's biggest daily newspaper announced in its front page headline: 'The mud of Genoa, shame of a country'.

Community effort: Italy's stagnant economy means public spending has been pared to the bone in many areas

Doing their beat: Young people wore raincoats and boots and were slathered in mud as they cleaned up
