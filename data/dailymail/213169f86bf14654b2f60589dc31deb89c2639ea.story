Gerald Vernon-Jackson, leader of Portsmouth City Council said most councils were planning to put up charges in more than one area

Thousands of families face inflation-busting rises to parking, pest control and waste charges this year, a survey has found.

Councils are planning to introduce fees in new areas, such as rat control - with one even charging parents whose children use care home facilities.

Some authorities are putting up parking charges by 10 or 20 per cent, while others are setting up CCTV in bus lanes for the first time - to make it easier to fine motorists who use them.

Others are charging households to move bulky or garden waste, while another has increased the cost of holding a funeral at its crematorium.

Cash-strapped councils blame Coalition budget cuts for the huge rises, and some are making frontline staff such as home helps, cleaners and dustbin men redundant.

But, shockingly, an analysis of job vacancies posted by councils shows that many are continuing to recruit advisers in areas such as diversity and carbon reduction - while claiming to be short of funds.

Critics say local authorities should be doing more to eliminate waste and reducing exorbitant salaries for chief executives and senior directives.

However, council finance experts warn that further increases to charges are inevitable as local authorities face budget cuts of £2billion this year.

Gerald Vernon-Jackson, leader of Liberal Democrat councillors in England and Wales, said that most councils were planning to put up charges in more than one area.

‘This Government wants us to be entrepreneurs and much more businesslike, so we are starting to charge for services that used to be free,’ he said.

‘This comes after our grants have been cut by 40 per cent over the last three years.’

The survey by the Times newspaper says councils are also likely to shed up to another 100,000 jobs this year, bringing the total number of job losses to more than 500,000 since the beginning of the present Parliament in 2010.

Several authorities, including Birmingham, Wakefield, Wolverhampton and Doncaster are planning to cut more than 1,000 jobs across areas including care, cleaning, and waste collection.

Most authorities are still finalising their council tax increases, but nearly two thirds of the 350 councils are to freeze their rates from next month, including almost all the London boroughs where elections are being held this year.

However, one third of councils have proposed tax increases of less than two per cent, effectively defying a pledge by George Osborne, the Chancellor, to freeze them.

About half of these have set a figure of 1.99 per cent, narrowly missing the rise that would force them to hold a referendum of residents on the issue. Brighton and Hove has suggested a 4.75per cent rise - triggering a referendum - but this may be overturned by the full council.

Mr Vernon-Jackson, who is leader of Portsmouth council, told the Times that, for the first time, his authority would introduce charges for children in care.

He said that many children spent only six to eight weeks in care homes when their families were having difficulties, but the cost of keeping them there was more than £2,000 a week.

‘We are asking families who can afford it to pay towards the cost of their children,’ he said. ‘It is only about £50 a week rather than £2,000, but it’s also to show them that they have to take responsibility.’

Portsmouth is also introducing a £43 charge for rat control, which is reduced for pensioners to £23.

‘We are also having to remove pensioner subsidies for allotments and bowling centres and we have put up parking charges in line with inflation,’ he said.

Westminster Council in central London has increased the cost of residents’ parking permits by 16 per cent over two years, Dudley in the West Midlands is proposing a 10 per cent increase in parking fees, and the Isle of Wight plans to raise its charges by 20 per cent.

Other councils, such as Wolverhampton, are introducing new parking fees.

Authorities such as Luton are introducing £25 charges for the removal of bulky rubbish and for garden waste, and Copeland council in Cumbria has proposed increasing cremation fees by £30.

Many authorities are closing youth services, Sure Start centres and family services.

Andrew Webb, chairman of the Association of Directors of Children’s Services, said: ‘Councils are now having to decide between investing in safer roads or safer children.’

Eric Pickles, the Comminities Secretary, has warned councils not to raise parking charges, which, he argues, hit local residents and retailers.

Brandon Lewis, the local government minister, said yesterday: ‘We are reining in councils’ over-zealous parking enforcement and unfair fines, have scrapped Labour’s plans for bin charging and are giving extra funding to councils to help freeze council tax.’

The Taxpayers’ Alliance said that councils were still spending lavishly on entertaining and travelling while many were still recruiting staff for oddly-titled jobs.

Among recent job advertisements were, for example, a ‘lead supplier relationship manager’, on £42,000, for Bristol Council, to improve supplier performance and be the ‘go-to’ person when market information is needed.

A spokesman for the alliance said: ‘For too long town halls have picked people’s pockets with tax hikes. Now that the pressure is on to freeze tax is no excuse to use stealthy ways to raise revenue.’
