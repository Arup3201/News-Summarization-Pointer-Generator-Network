Mosher is charged with felony sexual battery on a victim older than 12. He is being held without bond and has been ordered to have no contact with the victim or the 17-year-old suspected madame.

Police Capt. Tom Mattmuller told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune hat a third arrest is expected later in the day Tuesday.

The alleged sex trafficking ring first came to light in October after four students at Venice High School told administrators that De Armas, a student at Sarasota High, and a male student from their school wanted them to join, according to police. 

About the same time, police looked into reports of a Riverview High School student's involvement with Mosher.

De Armas and at least one other student are said to have come up with a plan over the summer to prostitute other teens for money and alcohol. 

Police documents indicate that the ring leader, Miss De Armas, arranged for Mosher to have sex with the 15-year-old girl in a community pool shed on Colonial Lane in Nokomis in August.

'She stated she told Mosher she did not want to have sexual intercourse with him to which he disregarded and forcefully held her against the wall of the pool shed building, restricting her movement and ability to flee,' charging documents stated. 

'Cyber-madame': Investigators say De Armas used her Facebook account to coordinate sexual encounters with clients

Businesswoman: The teenager allegedly discussed with her accomplice online prices for various sexual services 

According to his Facebook page, Mosher, a native of Illinois, works as a dishwasher at Fins at Sharky's on the Pier in Venice. 

Police say no activity took place on school property.

Students told officers that De Armas coordinated at least three prostitution deals — including the one with Mosher — through Facebook private messaging, according to police.

'Why pimp out old h*** when I have fresh young h*** I can give up for money?' De Armas allegedly wrote online. 'As long as I'm getting paid I'm trafficking all these (expletive).' 

Police said that a search warrant was issued for the 17-year-old's Facebook account and that they found conversations between potential clients and participants, along with details of how the transactions would be made. 

Client: Mosher, a dishwasher at a Venice restaurant, allegedly paid $40 and a bottle of liquor to have sex with a 15-year-old girl 

Crime scene: The illicit tryst between Mosher and the teenage girl took place at a community pool in Nokomis 

Investigators reportedly found online exchanges between De Armas and her accomplice discussing prices for various services: $50 to $70 for oral sex and $100 for sex with a virgin. 

Following Mosher's alleged sexual encounter with the 15-year-old, De Armas and her unnamed business partner began trying to expand their recruitment operation to bring in more girls for prospective clients.

According to witness accounts, De Armas and her accomplice planned to use the money paid by johns to buy drugs.
