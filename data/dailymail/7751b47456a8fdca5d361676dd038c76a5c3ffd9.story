The family of a British doctor who was found dead in his prison cell in Syria believe he was sedated with drugs before being hanged by his captors.

They fear Dr Abbas Khan’s body has been flushed with fluids to cover up evidence of anaesthetics in his bloodstream.

Although the results of a British post-mortem examination are not yet ready, a CT scan of Dr Khan’s body has apparently shown a cut in the femoral artery in one of his thighs, suggesting fluids were injected into his body.

His family also told The Mail on Sunday the Syrian authorities embalmed the 32-year-old’s body against their wishes before returning it to them.

Dr Khan’s brother, Dr Shahnawaz Khan, 29, said he fears the embalming was a deliberate attempt by the regime to ruin any future post-mortem examinations as the process involves flushing a dead body with fluids to preserve it.

He said: ‘We told the Syrians not to embalm the body, as we wanted to do it in Beirut ourselves, so we can take samples away for toxicology.  But they did it against our wish.’ Last week, a post-mortem examination was carried out along with toxicology tests at Queen’s Hospital, Romford, Essex. But his family fear the tests may prove inconclusive.

Dr Khan said his mother Fatima, 57, was contacted by Syrian prison guards on the morning of his brother’s death to tell her that her son was dead and there was ‘foam’ coming out of his mouth and nostrils.

He believes the foam was caused by his brother being injected with anaesthetics before he was hanged. He said: ‘It’s sickening what they have done to him. Even if the results are inconclusive, we have good reason to believe that he was anaesthetised and then hanged.’

Dr Abbas Khan, an orthopaedic surgeon from Streatham, South London, was detained by the Syrians for 13 months and tortured in a series of notorious prisons. The regime agreed to free him a fortnight ago, but he was found hanging in his cell only four days before his release.

David Cameron called his death ‘sickening’ and the Foreign Office said he was ‘in effect murdered’. Dr Khan was buried on Thursday after a funeral at the Regent’s Park mosque,  North London, attended by  more than 1,000 mourners.

On Friday, an inquest was opened into his death at the coroner’s court in Walthamstow. It was told that a Syrian post-mortem examination found that Dr Khan died of asphyxiation, and that he was due to appear before a terrorism court on the day of his ‘suicide’.

But his family dismissed the Syrian claims as lies, saying it is ‘inconceivable’ he would kill himself days before his release.
