The South Korean Government is investigating reports Kim Jong Un imposed another purge on those closest to him after rumours of North Korea's number two leader Choe Ryong Hae's disappearance.

The statement was made by the South Korean Government on Monday after mounting speculation since last week that Choi was in jail and being interrogated.

The Times reported South Koreaâ€™s Unification ministry, which deals with relations between the two countries, said it was 'looking into' the rumours.

Crazed: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had his uncle Jang Song Thaek executed in December last year

It is assumed Choi held several top positions in the North Korean leadership after Kim ordered the high-profile execution of Jang Song Thaek, the previous incumbent and Kim's uncle and mentor.

There is speculation Choi displeased Kim by taking management of several state-owned industries.

Rumors about Choi's disappearance have intensified since his no-shows  at public events he normally would have attended with Kim in February.

There was further speculation on Monday about his whereabouts when North Korea fired short-range missiles into the sea off its eastern coast as an act of defiance to South Korea.

The missiles as well as a series of Scud missiles, which were fired last week, were seen by Seoul as a signal from Pyongyang that it is still developing ballistic missile technology as part of its nuclear weapons program.

Kim's uncle Jang, 67, was executed in December, after being accused of plotting to overthrow the communist regime.

Jang was married to Kim Kyong Hui, Kim's aunt and former leader Kim Jong-Il's sister and was killed by firing squad.

It has since been claimed that members
 of his uncle's family were rounded up by the dozen following his arrest
 and subsequent death in December.

Jang Song-Thaek's children, brothers and grandchildren were condemned to death, according to media reports in South Korea.

Although
 South Korean news agencies have published unconfirmed information from 
North Korea in the past, the report from Daily NK back up the claims of a
 'purge' of Jang's family.

As
 well as his uncle, other high-ranking members of the military have been
 purged by Kim Jong-Un, including three defence ministers and three 
chiefs of the army's general staff.

Kim Chol, the vice minister of the army, was reportedly put to death in October 2012 by soldiers firing mortar rounds at him.

In
 August last year, members of a female musical group, Unhasu Orchestra -
 which included the dictator's ex-girlfriend - were reportedly publicly 
machine-gunned apparently for watching pornography and filming 
themselves naked.

There are said to have been between 40 to 80 public mass executions in North Korea in 2013.
