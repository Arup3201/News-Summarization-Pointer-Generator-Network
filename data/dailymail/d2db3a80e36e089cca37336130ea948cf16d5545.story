A dog owner who used herbal remedies on her injured pets rather than taking them to the vet has been banned from keeping animals after they lost almost all their hair.

Susan Lambert, 54, failed to take her two German Shepherds, called Tee and K, to the vet after they were accidentally sprayed with sulphuric acid by a farmer treating his crops.

Instead, she used homeopathic remedies at home in Colwall, Herefordshire but within three months both pets had lost their fur.

Ignored RSPCA advice: Susan Lambert did not take her two German Shepherds (pictured is Tee) to the vet after they were accidentally sprayed with sulphuric acid. Three months later they lost most of their hair

The animals were seized in May this year and Hereford Magistrates Court heard how Lambert had been initially advised by RSPCA officers to take her dogs to the vet after the accident.

Lambert was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to animals and banned from keeping animals for three years on Monday. She was also fined £600 and ordered to pay £400 court costs.

Before herbal remedies: Tee was happy and healthy before Lambert used homeopathic remedies on the dogs rather than taking them to the vet

After Tee and K were finally examined by vets, they were found to be riddled with parasitic mites that had burrowed into the dogs’ skin and caused them to suffer from severe mange, a parasitic skin infestation.

When RSPCA officers were called later on, they were shocked when they discovered five-year-old male K had shed half his fur while eight-year-old female Tee was completely bald from the neck down.

Tragically K was put down after vets also discovered he had an inoperable tumour.

Tee has made a remarkable full recovery and is being put up for adoption by an animal charity.

The ruling comes as a man who beat his Jack Russell dog to death in a brutal attack was jailed for 150 days and banned from keeping pets for life.

Christopher Keogh, 31, kicked, punched and slammed one-year-old Bambi against a brick wall before dumping the bloodied body in a bin.

Animal rights protesters Colchester Animal Defenders demonstrated outside Colchester Magistrates’ Court, jeering Keogh as he entered on Tuesday.
