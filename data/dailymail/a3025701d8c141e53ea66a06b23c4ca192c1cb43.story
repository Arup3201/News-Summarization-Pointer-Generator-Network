A sex abuse victim who was forced by his neighbour to act out Kama Sutra scenes when he was just nine years old has finally received justice after he bumped into his grinning abuser more than 30 years later.

Taxi driver Guy Beadle, 45, was abused at the hands of Barry Rosamund, then 15, who would hold his victim in a headlock, before forcing him to carry out sickening acts as he cried for mercy.

The father-of-two, from Beckenham, south London, always kept what happened a secret but was traumatised by the abuse his entire life.

Justice: Guy Beadle, 45 (pictured left) reported his abuser Barry Rosamund (right) to police three decades after being abused - after he bumped into him on the street in London 

But, in 2012,  Mr Beadle unexpectedly walked past Rosamund in the street. Sickeningly, Rosamund grinned at Mr Beadle, as if nothing had happened.

The incident infuriated Mr Beadle so much that he told his mother about the abuse, before reporting it to police.

Last year, Rosamund, of Looe, Cornwall, was finally convicted of four counts of indecent assault, one of attempted buggery and one of indecency with a child.

He said: 'It's nothing compared to the 37-year sentence I've served, but I now know I did the right thing by reporting him. 

'The monster had just smiled at me as if nothing had happened. It made me sick to my stomach. It made me realise how much destruction it has caused all through my life - all because of him.

'Now Barry is paying for what he did and, hopefully, he'll never be able to abuse another child again.' 

The abuse began when Mr Beadle, then nine, was living a few doors away from Rosamund, who was a friend of Mr Beadle's older brother, Mark. 

Mr Beadle, pictured as a child, was just nine years old when the abuse began 

When Rosamund began inviting Mr Beadle over to play along with his brother, he was thrilled to have a new, older friend.

He was also fascinated by all the state-of-the art toys Rosamund had at his home, something Mr Beadle and his brothers never had. 

He said: 'I remember looking around Barry Rosamund's front room. I felt like I'd just stepped into Aladdin's cave.

'Barry asked me what I wanted to have a go on. It was every nine-year-old boy's dream. It was like another world. I felt so grateful he didn't mind me tagging along.' 

But the abuse started when Rosamund asked Mr Beadle to visit his house alone.

On that first occasion, Rosamund asked Mr Beadle to touch him - and gave him £3 when he did.

'He said we could play table football. I left Gary and Mark behind and went to Barry's on my own.

'His mum was in the kitchen. But as we started playing the footie game in the living room something odd happened.

'He asked me to touch him intimately. I supposed it was normal and didn't want to be seen like a baby so did it. Afterwards he gave me £3. I thought it was what lads did.' 

Another afternoon, Rosamund forced Mr Beadle onto his knees and made him perform a sex act on him.

'Once he'd finished with me, he'd give me money and let me go. He threatened to kill me if I told anyone,' he said.

'I felt so worthless, but I was just a frightened child, didn't know what to do.'

Mr Beadle said that he would beg Rosamund to stop, but the abuse continued. 

He said: 'Most of the time we played in his bedroom. It would always end with Barry forcing me to touch him as I cried.

'He even had a calendar of the Kama Sutra and would make me pick positions from it to try. Then he'd violently wrestle me into the pose.

'If I refused he'd put me in a headlock, choke me until I almost passed out. So I went along with it.'

Then, when Mr Beadle was just ten, Rosamund tried to rape him.

He said: 'I was in agony. I somehow managed to fight him off. I made a decision there and then.

'I was going to stay away from Barry Rosamund. So I began taking the long way to school and avoided Barry's house. I stopped playing out with my friends, just in case he walked by.'

Soon after, Rosamund moved away to Cornwall. Although Mr Beadle was relived, he was plagued by what had happened.

When he was 19, he met a woman, with whom he had twin daughters. But that relationship soon broke down.

After another failed relationship, Mr Beadle moved back in with his mother.

He said: 'My memories chained me to the past. They made me feel foolish and dirty. 

'I tried to start again and aged 19, I met a girl and we had twin daughters. The four of us should've been so happy but I couldn't forget my childhood.

'It affected me so much more than I thought. I just couldn't get close to anyone.' 

The whole time, Mr Beadle was burdened by what had happened, unable to speak with anyone about it, even his mother.

'I'd never told her the truth,' he said. 'I was terrified it would kill her, knowing she had failed to protect me from the predator on our doorstep.'

But everything changed when Mr Beadle was walking along the road in 2012 and bumped into Rosamund.

The attacker had come to visit a former neighbour on the street on which the pair used to live. He grinned at his victim as he walked past the driveway.

Rosamund even parked his campervan right outside Mr Beadle's home.

'I was so furious. It was awful,' Mr Beadle said, 'Especially when he parked his campervan outside my mum's.

'I remember pacing up and down the living room, not knowing what to do. Then I stuck a note on his campervan, threatening him to go away. I just wanted him to go.'

A few months later, Mr Beadle decided to tell his mother about what had happened. Unable to talk about it, he left her a letter instead.

He said: 'She was distraught. My mum was a tough woman, from the era of "just plough on", but this stopped her in her tracks.

'I wrote a note because I could not tell her. Then I went out for an hour, saw the letter had been read and she was sat there with her head in her hands.

'I wanted her to understand me. It's not an excuse, but I just wanted to understand why I was how I was.'

Knowing the stress any court case would have on her, Mr Beadle vowed only to go to the police after she died. Two months later, she died suddenly from a massive brain aneurysm.

'They said there was no way of knowing but I thought the stress of knowing what Barry had done had probably killed mum,' Mr Beadle said.

In September 2014 Rosamund, then 50, appeared at Croydon Crown Court charged with four counts of indecent assault, one of attempted buggery and one of indecency with a child.

He pleaded not guilty but was convicted and jailed for three years

He said: 'It was horrific, standing up in that dock, being accused of making it up. It's just not a nice thing to face.

'I did not even have a screen because I wanted to face him - I wanted him to see the damage he had done to me. And I wanted to give it back.

'But now I can start moving on, trying to repair the damage he has done. I only wish I had reported him earlier.'
