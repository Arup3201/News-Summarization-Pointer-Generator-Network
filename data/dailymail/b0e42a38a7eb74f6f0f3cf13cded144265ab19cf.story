A lorry driver suffered shocking injuries after being stabbed with broken bottles after he tried to break up a fight between two strangers - which left his insides hanging out.

Anthony Dukes was stabbed 11 times in a secluded area of the picturesque Astbury Mere Country Park in Congleton, Cheshire, close to the visitors' centre.

The 25-year-old had been swimming in the park lake with friends when he spotted two men fighting and decided to intervene.

Cut to shreds: Anthony Dukes, 25, suffered horrific injuries when he tried to break up a fight and he was then stabbed with beer bottles - leaving his insides hanging out

But two beer bottles smashed together became jagged weapons causing horrific injuries to his face, chest and arms.

Mr Jukes, who was wearing swimming trunks at the time, said: ‘I tried to stop a fight when I was attacked.

‘It all got out of hand. I don't really know what happened.

‘I felt no pain. People knew before me that I had been stabbed.’

Mr Dukes’ friends, a group of six men and two women, were swimming in the lake when they saw their friend being attacked. They rushed out of the water to help.

Mr Dukes said: ‘I just heard somebody shout, 'Jukes, you are bleeding bad, get a towel.’

He only survived the brutal attack when an off-duty paramedic, who was in the park with his family, came to the rescue.

Mr Dukes, 25, had been swimming in the lake in Astbury Mere Country Park in Congleton, Cheshire, when he spotted the fight and jumped out of the water to try and break it up

He said: ‘I looked down and could see my insides.

‘I was holding my rib cage and stomach because I didn't want all the blood to come out.

‘I kept as calm as I could because if you are stressed, your blood pressure goes up.

‘I felt I was going because of all the blood I lost.’

The paramedic stemmed the loss of blood with towels until an ambulance took him to University Hospital of North Staffordshire where he spent four hours in surgery having more than 100 stitches.

Mr Jukes said: ‘Doctors told me I was very lucky. If there hadn't been an off-duty paramedic there, this could have been a very different situation.’

Lorry driver Mr Dukes needed more than 100 stitches and spent four hours in surgery. He will spend at least a month recovering before he can return to work

He is now recovering at his home in Packmoor, Stoke-on-Trent, with parents Terry and Linda.

Mr Dukes had hoped to start a new job as a heavy goods vehicle driver but he will need to take a month off work to recover.

But his manager has promised the role will still be waiting for him when he is better.

Police have arrested and bailed a 27-year-old Fenton man, pending further inquiries and appealed for more witnesses.

Mr Dukes’ father Terry, 57, said: ‘What has happened is absolutely diabolical. Anyone who has information should come forward. This could have been their son or their friend.’

Witnesses should call police on 01244 350 000, quoting incident number 1005 of July 26, or call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.
