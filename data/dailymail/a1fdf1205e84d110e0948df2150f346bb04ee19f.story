Justified? If the court comes to the same conclusion when it issues its ruling, Anders Breivik would avoid criminal responsibility for Norway's worst peacetime massacre

Mass killer Anders Breivik should be sent to a psychiatric hospital instead of jail, prosecutors said yesterday.

The 33-year-old Norwegian murdered 77 people in a shooting and bomb rampage last July.

However prosecutor Svein Holden said there were enough doubts about his sanity to make it impossible to send him to prison.

The defence is likely to reject  the insanity finding today, the last day of the ten-week trial.

Two teams of psychiatrists reached opposite conclusions about Breivik’s mental health after his attacks on a government building and a youth summer camp. One team diagnosed him with ‘paranoid schizophrenia’, a serious mental illness which would preclude a prison sentence.

The second team found him sane, saying he suffers from a narcissistic personality disorder.

Breivik claims he is sane and his attacks were motivated by his far-Right views.

'We request that he is transferred to compulsory psychiatric care,' prosecutor Svein Holden told the court in closing arguments.

Though there was conclusive evidence that Breivik was psychotic during the July 22 attacks, there were enough doubts about his sanity that he cannot be sentenced to prison under Norwegian law, Holden said.

Just like when the trial stared in mid-April, the 33-year-old Norwegian flashed a clenched-fist salute with his right arm before he was led out of the court today.

Earlier in the trial, Breivik said the psychiatric dimension of the case was a way for Norwegian authorities to ridicule him and divert attention from his ideology.

Grim: Earlier in the trial Breivik said the psychiatric dimension of the case was a way for authorities to ridicule him and divert attention from his ideology

Breivik claims Norway and Europe are being colonised by Muslims, who make up about 2 per cent of Norway's population. He has said he selected his targets - a government high-rise and a summer camp for the governing Labor Party's youth organisation - to strike against the political forces he claims betrayed the country with liberal immigration policies.

Horror: Seventy-seven people died in the attacks at Norway's government headquarters and a youth summer camp on the island of Utoya in July last year

Prosecutors said one of the key challenges to Breivik's sanity was his insistence of belonging to a militant anti-Muslim modeled after the Knights Templar, a Christian military order during the crusades, even though investigators have found no trace of the network.

Though Breivik tried to tone down the significance of the network during the trial, he maintained that it exists and that there are two other cells in Norway.
