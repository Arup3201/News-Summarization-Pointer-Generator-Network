It must have seemed like a good idea at the time.

NHS Trust boss Phil Morley was happy to shed his dignity for an office exercise campaign video, swapping his suit and tie for a Superman costume.

But his good intentions backfired when footage showing him warming to his new role was leaked on to the internet.

Phil Morley, chief executive of Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, has been ridiculed for taking part in a staff video which sees him don a 
Superman outfit and dance to Is This The Way To Amarillo?

What was meant to be a light-hearted stunt to encourage staff to take care of their own health, as well as that of patients, has sparked a fierce online backlash after it was leaked on the internet

The £175,000-a-year hospital chief 
executive was shown dancing through the corridors to Is This The Way To 
Amarillo dressed in a headband and blue superhero suit, complete with 
red cape.

The three-minute video, described by 
NHS staff as 'patronising' and 'embarrassing', was intended only for the
trust's employees, but the film was uploaded to YouTube.

As a result Mr Morley, head of Hull 
and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, has been the subject of an 
online backlash and branded an 'out of touch egomaniac'.

The video begins with a 'stressed' Mr Morley at his desk, wearing a shirt and tie, trying to answer several phones at once.

After taking a call on a mobile phone 
bearing the Superman 'S', he spins around in his chair and turns into an
overweight version of the comic book hero.

He starts to sing and wave his arms to
the Tony Christie hit and leads smiling staff in a dance down the 
office corridors and stairs.

Mr Morley's stunt has been likened to The Office's cringeworthy David Brent, played by Ricky Gevais, dancing at the office Christmas party

Mr Morley's trust is currently having to make savings of £100 million and has already made 250 people redundant - it was previously criticised for sending three bosses on a £5,500 week-long trip to the U.S.

The film, made to promote Workout at Work Day last Wednesday, shows Mr Morley juggling tasks and answering calls at his office as captions ask 'Busy? Tired? Tense? Aches? Pains?'

The short film was made to promote 
Workout At Work Day last Wednesday, but the chief executive was slammed 
online for 'suggesting chair dancing and chair exercises are what is 
needed to improve morale and reduce stress'.

Comments included: 'What an idiot! Is 
this what our taxes are being used for?' Another said: 'There's 
something seriously wrong with this man … being paid £100k and more to 
be an idiot.'

One disgruntled NHS employee wrote: 
'Cannot believe he thought this was a good idea, staff morale at its 
lowest, people having to reapply for jobs, understaffed wards, need I go
on. Get in the real world and stop patronising the hardworking 
workforce.'

The video then shows him spin round in his chair and magically transform into Superman - complete with Lycra outfit and bright red boots - before Is This The Way to Amarillo? starts to play

He is then seen dancing around the hospital with other members of staff. Mr Morley has defended the video saying it was designed to encourage staff to think about keeping fit while working

And another labelled his performance 'painfully cringey, embarrassing and degrading'.

The trust stressed that the video took 15 minutes to film and was made internally, at no extra cost.

Mr Morley said he was asked by the physiotherapy team to help promote the campaign.

It aims to encourage workers to be more active to combat stress and avoid problems such as back pain.

He said: 'The idea was to create 
something quirky and memorable to encourage staff to think about how 
they can keep themselves fit and healthy while at work and I felt it was
a worthwhile project to be involved with.

'Whether people loved the event or 
hated it, the health and wellbeing of trust staff is vital to us as an 
organisation and to our patients, which is why we are keen to invest 
both time and effort in this area.'

But the NHS boss did not impress cancer patient Danny Marten, who has campaigned against local health cuts.

He said: 'This video is nothing short of buffoonery.'
