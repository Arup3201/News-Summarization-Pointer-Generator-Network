The Football Association will investigate Manchester United manager David Moyes' latest outburst against referees following Tuesday night's defeat to Sunderland in the Capital One Cup.

The 2-1 first leg loss was United's third defeat in a week - the first time this has happened since 1992 - and Moyes claimed afterwards his team are 'playing referees as well as the opposition.'

It follows on from Moyes saying it was 'scandalous' that United were not awarded a late penalty against Tottenham in a league defeat at Old Trafford on New Year's Day.

An FA spokesman said: 'We are looking into David Moyes' comments to the media following the match at Sunderland.'

Not a happy man: United boss David Moyes said his side had to play against the officials as well as Sunderland

Andre Marriner had no choice but to award Sunderland a penalty after his assistant Peter Bankes flagged that Tom Cleverley had tripped Adam Johnson just inside the penalty area.

A referee can over-rule his assistant but given the relative positions of the two officials that was not credible.

Although Cleverley’s contact was at most minimal, it was a silly challenge in a critical area and that forced Bankes to make a decision.

Perhaps it was harsh but Manchester United’s reaction was over the top, with Ryan Giggs shouting at Marriner and Rafael picking up a yellow card for his protest.

The Brazilian might well have seen red minutes later when making a rash tackle but Marriner wisely decided that the two offences did not merit a dismissal and left United with 11 players.

After Fabio Borini's penalty consigned United to another defeat, Moyes
 said: 'After the first 15 minutes I thought we were very good. We 
defended a terrible free-kick, but how the referee has given a free-kick
 for that is way beyond me.

'I
 just cannot see how that is a free-kick. 'And the penalty? We had a 
player booked for that theother day against Tottenham. The  referee is 
in a great position to look  at it, down the line, 15 yards, and the 
linesman gives it from behind and he cannot see through Patrice Evra.

‘That is what we’re finding at the moment. The performance was good without having the last bit.

‘I have experience and I can sense it’s on the verge of turning. I sense we’re about to get a bit better.’

More
 than 5,000 Manchester United supporters were in the 31,547 crowd and 
Moyes paid tribute to them and Ferguson, who left the Stadium of Light 
through the Press room carrying a bottle of red wine.

Moyes
 added: ‘I can only see Alex as a great sounding board, a great help, 
and so is Sir Bobby Charlton, he is  terrific. Bryan Robson is at the 
training ground regularly.

Spot of bother: Tom Cleverley brings down Adam Johnson and concedes a penalty

Not impressed: Patrice Evra argues with referee Marriner

‘It’s
 great 5,000 came up tonight and they were fantastic throughout the 
game. They recognised how well their team had done for most of the game.

‘This
 hasn’t happened at Man United for a long time. I thought the support 
were great for sticking with their club, sticking with their manager and
 that is exactly what you need when you are not doing so well.

‘We
 need a couple of fair decisions. We had a couple of penalty kicks 
against Tottenham and we have one given against us tonight for that. My 
goodness, give me strength.’

Moyes will hope to have strikers Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie fit for the second leg.

Not going to plan: United defender Nemanja Vidic looks dejected as his side lost for the third time in a week

All going wrong: Ryan Giggs gave Sunderland the lead with an own goal

But
 there is more concern for the manager with United captain Nemanja Vidic
 set to leave Old Trafford this summer after his agent said he is 
unlikely to sign a new contract.

Vidic’s
 four-year deal runs out at the end of the season and talks over a new 
one have stalled, with  Italian clubs Inter Milan, Fiorentina and Napoli
 monitoring the situation.

His
 agent Silvano Martina said: ‘At the moment, I would rule out an 
extension with Manchester United. Vidic, given his contract situation, 
has several teams looking at him.’

Not going to plan: Danny Welbeck and United struggled at the Stadium of Light

Tuesday
 night’s win for Sunderland was their first over United for 20 games. 
And manager Gus Poyet, whose side are bottom of the league, was at a 
loss to explain their excellent cup form.

He
 said: ‘It is something I need to find out why we beat top teams and are
 so clinical in the cup and can’t do the same in the league. That’s my 
job.

‘Are we favourites? No 
chance. They have Rooney and van Persie to come back. We are in a better
 situation but playing Man U away, anything can happen and we need 
another very good performance.’
