A brother allegedly swindled out of a share of a £1.5 million inheritance by his younger sibling has told a jury of his shock at finding his mother's bank accounts almost empty.

Jonathan Howes, 55, said he had no idea that just £350 was left in his mother Joyce's bank accounts following her death in November 2011 aged 81, Bristol Crown Court heard.

Mr Howes' brother Peter, 53, is on trial accused of five counts of fraud.

His wife Jane, 51, faces a single charge of fraud.

The pair, of Lower Barn Farm, Lechlade, Gloucestershire, deny the charges.

It is alleged that Howes, as an executor to a number of trusts and settlements, wound them up by forging the signatures of his mother or brother Jonathan.

He also cashed in two life insurance policies, worth just under £100,000 together, before pocketing the money, prosecutors claim.

Jurors were told that the estate should have been split equally between Howes and his brother, but he transferred cash into a joint account, set up between himself and his mother, then moved it into a sole account in his name.

The cash was then handed to former partners and used to buy a 40 percent stake in an online gaming company set up by a relative of his wife.

Mr Howes, an experienced lawyer based in Singapore, told jurors that he became aware of problems in the probate of his mother's will in 2011 during a conversation with family lawyers.

Bristol Crown Court heard that under the terms of an agreement Joyce Howes' estate should have been divided equally between her two sons  

He then contacted a branch of LloydsTSB in Hastings, Sussex, where his mother banked and was told her accounts were virtually empty with just £350 left.

'I discovered during the course of this discussion that all of my mother's bank accounts were effectively empty - there was no money left,' Mr Howes told the court.

'I learned that all the money in those bank accounts had been transferred out to a joint e-saver account.

'The account was opened in the name of Peter and my mother's name was subsequently added on August 7 2009 as a joint account holder.

'They told me that all of the money in all of the accounts had been moved on and then, over a long period of time, had been taken out and gone into Peter's current account.'

Mr Howes said the proceeds of the sale of his mother's house - totalling £1,000,050 - had been transferred out.

'The bank told me that they had never been informed of my mother's death,' he told jurors.

Mr Howes insisted that in conversations with his elderly mother she never mentioned signing documents to close family trusts - leaving him to receive cash upon her death and his brother the shares.

'I was shocked when I heard this,' he said.

'The understanding was that it would be divided equally so I was rather surprised when the solicitor said I would get the cash and Peter the shares.

'I never had any conversation with Peter about winding up the trusts.'

The court heard that Howes' father Thomas set up a number of trusts in 2002 a couple of years before he died.

A letter was sent to both brothers where they were told proceeds of the estate, upon the deaths of both their parents, 'should be divided equally between them'.

Howes was given the principle responsibility for dealing with the administration of the trusts following his father's death in August 2004, the court was told.

He wound up one settlement, giving half the proceeds, some £120,000, to his brother, who at the time was living in Hong Kong with his wife and children. 

Mr Howes, right, allegedly resented having to look after his ailing mother Joyce after his brother Jonathan moved to south east Asia to continue his career as a construction lawyer, Bristol Crown Court heard 

Rufus D'Cruz, representing Howes, suggested to Jonathan Howes that he did not have a particularly close relationship with his parents.

'I think that would be fair,' Mr Howes said under cross-examination.

Mr Howes told jurors that it would 'not be unusual' for him not to speak to his mother for a couple of weeks while he was working abroad.

'I am the first to accept that my mother was a very difficult woman,' he said.

'I do not accept I hated my mother, I loved my mother. I admit on occasions I found her very difficult to deal with but I didn't hate my mother.' 

Peter Howes, 53, allegedly resented being left to look after their ailing mother Joyce when his brother Jonathan moved to Hong Kong and then Singapore with his career.

He began to siphon off cash from her estate and continued for some time after she passed away in November 2010, it was said.

Despite organising her funeral and liaising with his brother about probate Howes also neglected to reveal he had wound up a number of trusts and settlements and cashed in two life insurance policies, before pocketing the money.

A court heard he also failed to tell authorities his mother had died, giving him full access to her bank accounts and trust funds for some time after her death.

The family estate should have been split equally between Howes and his brother but he transferred the cash into a joint account, set up between himself and his mother, then moved it into his own account.

The cash was then handed to pay off former partners as well as 'loaned' to him to pay for the redevelopment on a property he owned in France, it was said.

But the ploy unfolded after Mrs Howes died aged 81 and Jonathan discovered his brother's alleged deception during a conversation with her bank Lloyds TSB.

Howes was arrested and charged with five counts of fraud, which he denies. His wife Jane, 51, denies one count. 

Bristol Crown Court heard the brothers were told of their parents' plans to split their inheritance equally in 2002.

A letter was sent to both telling them the proceeds of the estate upon the deaths of both father, Thomas, and Joyce 'should be divided equally between them.'

Howes was given principle responsibility of dealing with the administration of the trusts following his father's death in August 2004 and began to wind up one trust, giving the proceeds of £109,000 to his brother. 

Mrs Howes' health deteriorated dramatically after a fall at her home in Bexhill-on-Sea, Essex in 2009 and she moved in with Howes and his wife in Lechlade, Gloucestershire. 

Jonathan Howes told the court he had a very different relationship with his mother than his brother Peter following their father's death in 2004.

He said: 'She would say to me Peter never expresses his feelings, he never tells me he loves me.

'I would say "but Peter does things for you and that is how he expresses his love".

'If I'm honest about this period, and it was a very difficult period, is that up until 2008 Peter was doing the kind of fixing.

'He would do the tax returns, he would sort practical stuff out.

'But I was the one she spoke to, I was the one I think she would see as the emotional support, we would talk about her feelings and the future.'

Bristol Crown Court, pictured, heard that Jonathan Howes, who moved to south east Asia had a 'difficult' relationship with his mother after the death of his father Thomas in 2004

He added: 'I think it would be fair to say that prior to that I didn't have a particularly close relationship with my mother.

'We all loved each other and we were close but it was not a situation where there would be daily or even weekly phone calls or visits.

'When I moved to Hong Kong contact was inevitably even less, obviously when you are 6,000 miles away you are restricted in terms of visits but I would always visit when I was back in the UK, but that was sometimes an annual event.'

The court heard following his father's death Peter began to look after his mother's affairs, with brother Jonathan rarely having any input.

Instead the brothers exchanged a handful of emails about the tasks, and when their mother had a fall in 2009 Jonathan admitted contact became 'even more sporadic'.

'I took some comfort from the fact she was living with Peter and Jane and had somebody looking after her,' he said.

'Rightly or wrongly I probably had less contact as a result because I thought she was being looked after.

'Over that period, a period of quite dramatic change in her physical and mental appearance, it was difficult to talk to her by telephone.

'I made contact in December and she was quite engaged.

'Looking back I think Peter made it quite difficult for me to speak to mum over that period.

'Even at that time my sense was that my phone calls were in a sense orchestrated by him.'

The court also heard that Jonathan pushed for his mother to move into sheltered accommodation after feeling she had 'no bond with Peter'.

He told the jury: 'I will regret to the end of my life I was not more forceful that mum should have gone into sheltered accommodation.

'I now know things we're going on in terms of her finances, but at the time I was not critical of Peter it was a really difficult situation.

'But the relation between them had broken down and it was simple about caring for her physical needs.'

Mr Howes and his wife deny all charges. 

The trial continues.
