You can't be the England manager by default. You can’t be the England manager because the Football Association are out of ideas. You can’t be the England manager because we have  managed expectations down to a level where picking some new names while losing every game that matters constitutes level par. You can’t be the England manager without making it out of the World Cup’s group stage.

Except now you can. Greg Dyke, FA chairman, confirmed it. Roy Hodgson will see out his contract until 2016, at least. The country, staring at its worst World Cup performance since 1994, and its first group-stage exit since 1958, must consider itself satisfied. This is as good as it gets. This is what we must expect. This is who we are now. The smiling idiots just happy to be at the party. But don’t forget to book that cab home for 11.30pm. Wouldn’t want to be out too late.

Hodgson isn’t a turnip or a wally, but he isn’t the answer, either. Who is? The FA don’t know and are not interested in finding out. Dyke talks blithely of winning a World Cup in 2022 but his is an organisation devoid of ambition. The desire to be better, to progress, to go further, has deserted them. They are happy as they are. A new kit every year and out with Australia. They have settled. And that shouldn’t be.

Best manager experienced?

Terry Venables gave the players confidence. We have never looked as comfortable on the ball since.

Favourite England moment?

England 4 Holland 1. That night it was possible to imagine England as European champions.

Best player in your lifetime?

I am still waiting for an England player who can match pre-injury Paul Gascoigne in 1990. 

There are no guarantees from here, even with change. There is no outstanding candidate, no English equivalent of Jose Mourinho or Arsene Wenger, no popular choice as there was in the days of Brian Clough.

Yet that is not the point. We do not know what another manager would bring to the job until we offer that chance. We do not know whether, within Steve Bruce or Alan Pardew, or Gary Neville, Gareth Southgate, even Paul Clement, is an insight or a spark that could take this team forward. We know what Hodgson did with it, and it wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t enough.

The FA has a problem, though, and it is not just in its paltry list of suitable candidates. It is pregnant with West Bromwich Albion — eight months gone with a mid-table club that has somehow been allowed to take over the way English football is run. Hodgson is the manager, Dan Ashworth is the FA’s technical director, the friends of Ashworth are on the technical staff.

What should always be a two-term cycle, at most, has been allowed to grow into a philosophical overhaul that makes regime change at the top even more daunting. Those at the head of Club England were looking for a quiet life after Fabio Capello and that is what Hodgson affords. They will claim to be nobly resisting a knee-jerk reaction now, yet there is nothing hasty or thoughtless in seeking a better way.

Costly: Fabio Capello was paid £6million-a-year yet could not transform England's fortunes

One day, the FA will alight on a manager who can bring more from a group of England players than is expected, just as Bruce exceeded expectations at Hull City last season or Sean Dyche did at Burnley. It happens. Appointing Tony Pulis was regarded as an exercise in futility at Crystal Palace, but it proved a stroke of genius. If anything, it is more negligent not to try, to simply presume that this is the way it has to be, with England unable to defeat an Italian side beaten by Costa Rica or deal with a half-fit Luis Suarez. Hodgson has not done a poor job, but results here have been below what was anticipated of the much-ballyhooed ‘best prepared team at the World Cup’. There is no shame, no dishonour. Step aside, let someone else have a go, see where they can take it. The small margins are up for discussion.

Losing two games by the odd goal in three suggests England are nearly a good team. Yet if Hodgson had the key to that final leap of improvement, where was it in Brazil? Might another coach improve it? We will never know until we try.

Expectations cannot be managed any lower. Alex Horne, the FA general secretary, said that Hodgson had done enough to see out his contract just by getting to the World Cup, but such meek, uncomplaining support is part of the problem.

If there was a moment England were set on this dismal course, it was Dyke’s cut-throat gesture when the draw was made. Light-hearted it may have been, but it suggested that little would be presumed of England here, and chimed with the mistaken belief that Hodgson had already negotiated a tough qualifying group, seeing off the might of Ukraine, Poland and Montenegro.

Perhaps it was this complacency that underscored the decision to leave John Terry in international retirement, when it was plain bigger challenges awaited in Brazil. The sight of England clinging on for dear life in Poland and Montenegro and at home to Ukraine should have rung alarm bells; instead we were told these were good draws that showed England’s defence could handle the pressure. It proved a significant misjudgment, like the exclusion of Ashley Cole.

Dead in the water? Greg Dyke appeared not to fancy England's chances in Brazil at the World Cup draw

Signs of decline: England were fortunate to leave Wembley with a point against Ukraine

When Leighton Baines showed signs of weakness against Italy, if Cole had been named in the squad a change could have been made. Instead, all Hodgson had to play with was the untried Luke Shaw. Without doubt, England’s starting XI could have been stronger. Much is made of the absence of Englishmen at champions Manchester City, but the strongest attacking team last season were Liverpool, and the strongest defence was at Chelsea, and both elements had an English core. To put them together would then require the addition of four players: a goalkeeper, a right back, a wide midfielder and a  second forward. It is a better base on which to build than many  England managers have had.

Hodgson deserves credit for introducing Raheem Sterling, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Ross  Barkley, but it is not as if these selections were from left field.

Without doubt Barkley and Oxlade-Chamberlain are among the best 20 footballers in England today and Sterling inside the top 10. A new manager would not  discard these figures or return English football to some dark age.

With very few exceptions, all English coaches at Premier League level are trying to play in a sophisticated way. Bruce was captain of a brilliant Manchester United side, and took Hull to their first Wembley final playing a very open game.

At their best, Pardew’s Newcastle United have played some lovely stuff, as did Tottenham Hotspur under Harry Redknapp.

One imagines Gary Neville wouldn’t be a long-ball merchant, either, or Real Madrid’s Paul Clement beside him. It is not as if Hodgson’s methods are particularly radical. Others would carry them on, and pick many of the same players. They might, however, locate the 10 per cent improvement that Hodgson could not. 

England’s management cycle is out of 
whack at the moment and has been since Steve McClaren was dismissed. The
 World Cup is used to prepare for the European Championship. It should 
be the other way around. If Hodgson sees out his deal in 2016, his 
successor will get his first tournament in Russia in 2018. And the next 
two years are largely meaningless anyway.

Learning the ropes: Gary Neville consoles Wayne Rooney after the defeat to Uruguay

The qualifying campaign for 2016 is a tap-in. Third place in a group comprising Switzerland, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania and San Marino might be enough. If England cannot make it through given those circumstances there is not a manager alive that can help them. What it means, though, is that the next time Hodgson will truly be tested is at the European Championship finals in France. And what if it brings more of the same? What if two years on, England are still  little more than youthful and lively? What if they are still beset by nerves at crucial moments, vulnerable at the back and prone to wastefulness in front of goal? What if Hodgson is still hunting that missing piece? Another tournament passes by.

For whatever reason, some managers influence. Gary Cahill looks a better defender with Terry, but he also looks a better player for Chelsea, too, even when Terry is not by his side. So Mourinho gets more from him. When Uruguayan goalkeeper Fernando Muslera punted that goal-kick forward and Steven Gerrard rose to head it, Suarez gambled on the five per cent chance his Liverpool team-mate might not connect properly and began his run. Cahill was not alive to it. For Chelsea, for whatever reason, he would have been.

For another England manager? Maybe. Maybe not. Either way, we’ll never know.
