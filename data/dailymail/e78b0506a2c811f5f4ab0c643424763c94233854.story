A goose-stepping 80-year-old who made Nazi salutes and who terrorised her neighbours for seven years leaving some suicidal has been handed an ASBO.

Edna Beck ranted and raved for up to six hours at a time, threw her soiled underwear out of the window, pushed over a 
visitor's motorbike, threatened to punch people and stole, hid and 
defaced neighbours' post.

She regularly insulted Muslims, Jews, Germans, Poles and gay people and frequently shouted 'Heil Hitler!', as well as goose-stepping and making the Nazi salute outside her block of flats in Hove, East Sussex.

At one point, council officers were dealing with an average of three anti-social problems with her a week.

She was arrested on Tuesday after a loud, disturbing rant about US President Barack Obama.

PC Kevin Michnowicz, Brighton anti-social behaviour coordinator, described her as 'racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic.'

Brighton magistrates heard how Beck, who walks with a zimmer frame, showed no signs of dementia or mental illness, but delighted in making life hell for everyone around her, leaving some 'depressed and suicidal.'

Brighton and Hove Council received 49 complaints and many more were made to police.

Goose-stepping: Edna Beck, 80, has been handed an Asbo for her behaviour

Mike Tyler, prosecuting on behalf of the council, said: 'Children were terrified of her because she called them Hitler's children.

'When challenged she treats her behaviour as a joke and relishes in the misery she causes.

'She has left neighbours depressed and suicidal.'

He said she had been arrested several times but was carried on regardless.

He said: 'She will continue to perpetrate anti-social behaviour wherever she lives.

'There is an urgent need to protect the community.

'She has not been deterred by the arrests.'

One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'She just seems to hate everyone.

'The first time I met her she was laying on the floor and the shouting started that night.

'It's awful.'

She was given an interim Anti Social 
Behaviour Order (Asbo) banning her from inciting hatred, being drunk and
disorderly and shouting to cause alarm.

Beck, who disrupted the proceedings constantly, said: 'I've never been anti-anything in my life. I'm for everything.'

Outside court she said: 'I'm not anti-social. I'm a normal woman and everyone can tell you that.'

Brighton and Hove Councillor Ben Duncan, Cabinet Member for Communities, Equalities and Public Protection said: 'We have not taken this action lightly and have done everything we can to avoid imposing an interim ASBO on an 80-year-old woman, but Ms Beck has left us with no option.

'Despite numerous offers of support and warnings from council officers and police, Ms Beck has continued to cause considerable distress to her neighbours and other members of the community with her persistent intimidating and anti-social behaviour.

'This council has a duty to protect our residents from all forms of anti-social behaviour so they can live peacefully and without fear and it is a duty we take very seriously.

'We sincerely hope that Ms Beck will now consider the serious nature of her behaviour and of the implications should she continue to behave in this manner.

'We will continue to offer Ms Beck support to help her address her behaviour and become a good neighbour.'
