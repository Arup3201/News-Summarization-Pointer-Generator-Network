Epperly allegedly dragged the body of his girlfriend from their crashed 2004 Ford Explorer after he ran off the road and into a tree, fence post and utility pole.  

He then took the body of Karla M. Wolford, 38, into the couple's home at 3980 South County Road 500 West, Tipton and laid Wolford's body in the living room before calling 911.

When police officers arrived on the scene they found Epperly drinking a beer.

The Tipton County Sheriff's Department first responded to the crash at approximately 10:49 p.m. Thursday, police said, before requesting State Police assistance.

Epperly was driving eastbound on County Road 400 South, approaching a T-intersection at County Road 500 West, police said, when he failed to stop for a stop sign at County Road 500 West. 

Instead, police said, he continued through the T-intersection.

A spokesperson for Indiana State Police said: 'The Explorer struck a fence post in a driveway at 3980 South County Road 500 West.'

'The Explorer then veered off the driveway and hit a tree and a utility pole. The crash impact severed the utility pole.'

Wolford was pronounced dead once emergency responders arrived.

Epperly only had minor injuries.

Both the driver and the passenger were wearing seat belts at the time of the crash, according to police.

The investigation into the fatal car crash is ongoing and results from a toxicology test are pending.
