Two cocaine dealers were caught after they bought so many blenders to mix the drug that supermarket staff became suspicious and notified police.

Thomas Davies bought as many as 12 blenders from the Asda store, prompting employees, not convinced he was going to use the appliances for cooking, to phone police.

The pair were found with £300,000 worth of the Class-A drug when officers raided the home belonging to his partner, Gavin Etchell, in Tonypandy, South Wales, last September.

The two men were jailed for more than 15 years at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court yesterday after admitting to conspiracy to supply cocaine. 

Roger Griffiths, prosecuting, said that police searched Etchell's home in Tonypandy on September 19 after being informed by Asda store staff who were suspicious of Davies' purchases.

As officers prepared to enter the property, Davies, 29, who was outside in the street, texted Etchell to try to warn him.

Inside, police found four compressed blocks of cocaine with a purity of between 9 and 11 per cent and a combined weight of 1,011g and a street value of £300,000.

There was also 5.8kg of benzocaine, a cutting agent used to increase profits, bags and traces of drugs on the kitchen worktop.

'It was the purchase of handheld mixers by Davies in such quantities at the Asda store that the suspicions of the staff were aroused and the police were informed,' said Mr Griffiths.

Cash was also found at Etchell's home and a further £4,000 cash was found at Davies' home, also in Tonypandy, when arrested.

'Both defendants were involved in the significant supply of cocaine,' said Mr Griffiths.

Etchell admitted further counts of possessing cannabis with intent to supply on the drug being found at his home and possessing a stun gun.

He had boasted about having the gun, a court heard, but on testing it was found not to work.

Alexander Greenwood, defending Etchell, 33, who has a record for possessing drugs with intent to supply, said he was aware the only sentence was one of custody.

Andrew Taylor, defending Davies, who has a record for possessing cocaine, said he was a loving father. 'He has reflected at the pain, anguish and torture he has put his children through,' he said.

Judge Richard Twomlow jailed Etchell for a total of nine years and Davies for six years and eight months. 

After the case acting Detective Inspector Dan Michel, said: 'Thanks to information we had from the community we were able to take action and take these two drug dealers out of business.

'They were clearly dealing in large quantities of cocaine and were behind the area's supply.

'A significant amount of cash has been seized and officers will look for any assets that they suspect were funded through drug money and confiscate them under the Proceeds of Crime Act.'
