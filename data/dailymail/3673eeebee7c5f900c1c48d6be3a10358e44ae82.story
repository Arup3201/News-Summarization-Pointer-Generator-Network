Zara Phillips branded her husband Mike Tindall an ‘idiot’ when he splashed out £12,000 at auction on a racehorse he knew absolutely nothing about.

But the Queen’s granddaughter has been forced to eat her words after Monbeg Dude emerged victorious at the Welsh Grand National – and his value raced to the £200,000 mark.

The former England rugby star explained: ‘I like to bid at auctions without meaning to actually win things. I only went for a bite to eat and a night out. No horse had gone for less than £28,000 so I thought my first bid of £10,000 was pretty safe, likewise when I upped it to £12,000.

Proud: Owners Mike Tindall and Mike Scudamore with their racehorse Monbeg Duke, now worth £200k after an initial £12k pricetag

‘I knew nothing about the horse, hadn’t checked the brochure and couldn’t even see the Dude, as I was sitting with my back to the sale ring.’

Fortunately for Tindall, Michael Scudamore – son of champion jockey Peter – and fellow rugby players James Simpson-Daniel and Nicky Robinson agreed to share the burden of the cost.

Scudamore had to make a 30-minute drive from the sale room to his home in Cheltenham so he could pick up a lorry to transport the impromptu purchase.

Athlete: Zara Phillips is known for her prowess in the equestrian field

He said: ‘I drove home, collected the 
lorry, drove back to Cheltenham, picked up the Dude and took him back to
the yard. It was past one in the morning before we were done.’

Scudamore admits he didn’t have high hopes for the horse at the Welsh Grand National at Chepstow two weeks ago.

‘I just felt the ground would be too soft, that the course was too demanding and the opposition too experienced,’ he said.

After the success, Dude is believed to be worth £200,000 but Tindall and his friends insist they have no plans to sell him.

Tindall said: ‘Zara will take Monbeg Dude over showjumping poles at home and improve his technique.’

His next racing outing could be at the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March.

Tindall said: ‘The soft ground and the undulating course suits Dude well.’

He added: ‘The whole thing is ridiculous. We’re beginning to dream that we might one day do even better than the Welsh Grand National.

‘And it’s all because people didn’t turn up to a sales night and I took their place with no plans to end the evening as an owner with a horse I knew  nothing about, or even saw. You couldn’t make it up, could you?’ he laughed.

racehorse without knowing anything it, but now has to eat her words
