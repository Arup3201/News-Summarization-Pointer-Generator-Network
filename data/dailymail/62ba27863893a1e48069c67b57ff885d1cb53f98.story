With an election looming, he clearly needs to keep his strength up.

But Nick Clegg has revealed that the food that will keep him going through the long campaign slog ahead is a snack full of salt and fat.

The Deputy Prime Minister says his ‘staple diet’ at lunch is a Swedish meatball wrap and soup from high street sandwich chain Pret a Manger.

The wrap is among the firm’s less healthy choices – containing 636 calories, 35g of fat and 3g of salt

The wrap is among the firm’s less healthy choices – containing 636 calories, 35g of fat and 3g of salt.

Keen to show he has a common touch, the Lib Dem leader has become the latest leading politician to wax lyrical about their favourite dining spot.

David Cameron said on Wednesday that he would rather eat at Nando’s than a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, while Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls spoke of his love of the Olympic Breakfast at Little Chef.

According to Pret a Manger’s website, its Swedish Meatball Hot Wrap contains pork meatballs, sliced Greve cheese, chilli tomato sauce and sliced red onions encased in a tortilla wrap.

Its salt content is half the recommended daily amount for an adult man, while the fat content is almost 40 per cent – but the firm says the wrap is ‘high in protein’ with a ‘good mix of the B vitamins’.

The salt and fat filled snack favoured by Mr Clegg

Mr Clegg revealed his love of the snack on his regular phone-in show on LBC radio – although he was unable say how much the £4.25 sandwich cost. ‘Can I speak up for the Swedish meatball wrap that Pret do?’ he said. ‘That’s quite a staple diet for me.’

Lib Dem sources said Mr Clegg often chose the South Indian Tomato and Spice soup – a 370g portion of which contains just under 200 calories.

A year ago it emerged he had taken up kickboxing in a bid to get fit and slim down for the General Election – even asking for a pair of yellow boxing gloves from his wife Miriam so he could ‘get stuff out of my system’. Aides said his fitness regime had helped him lose around a stone.

Mr Cameron spoke about his love of Nando’s in an interview with music station Capital Xtra on Wednesday – also inviting host Andre Wisdom to call him ‘David, Dave, geezer, whatever you like.’ Mr Balls told LBC he liked Little Chef’s breakfast platter, adding: ‘The fried potatoes are just brilliant.’
