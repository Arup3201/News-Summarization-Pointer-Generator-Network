Scotland Yard announced the world’s biggest trial of body-worn video cameras last night in a bid to change the face of modern policing.

Up to 1,000 high-definition cameras will be used by officers for a year in a £1.6million test of the cutting-edge technology.

Commanders hope the footage will help restore trust in the force and give an ‘objective’ account of the most controversial confrontations.

Trial: Patrolling police officers in London will start wearing the first of three camera models in April

The announcement comes just days after an inquest ruled Mark Duggan, from Tottenham in North London, was lawfully killed by armed officers in 2011, in an incident which sparked riots.

Questions over the actions of those involved in the shooting dogged the Met for more than two years.

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, head of the Met’s firearms unit, added: ‘I am absolutely convinced it is the right thing to do.

'These are officers who want to be believed and want the public to trust them, and if that is what it takes, that’s what we have to do.’

The move has been hailed as a positive, behaviour-changing move which will instill faith in the Force

Officers will trial three brands of cameras, with the first expected on the streets in April.

London Mayor Boris Johnson, who oversees the work of the Met, said the cameras will help ‘change behaviour’.

He added: ‘We know body-worn cameras help clear up confusion and enable police officers to gather stronger evidence.’
