New storm: Katie Hopkins was a called a racist after a series of controversial tweets were sent from her Twitter account

A number of anti-Muslim rants were sent from Katie Hopkins' Twitter account last night including one that called Palestinians 'filthy rodents'.

The former Apprentice contestant, 39, also demanded that Israel 'restart the bombing campaign' on Gaza after two Israelis were stabbed to death in separate knife attacks in Tel Aviv yesterday.

The messages have sparked demands for Hopkins to be arrested, but it is not clear whether her Twitter account had been hacked.

The bizarre tweets from her account, where she refers to herself as 'telling it like it is', were branded Islamophobic today and started at around 9pm last night.

A number were about the ongoing crisis in the Middle East and the series of stabbings apparently carried out by an Arab man on two Israelis who eventually died yesterday.

Tweets from Ms Hopkins' account said: 'Palestinians busy knifing Israelis. 2 state solution my a***. Filthy rodents burrowing beneath Israel. Time to restart the bombing campaign.

'Arab terrorists fired rockets from schools and hospitals. They brought down Israeli fire on to their own people. See behind the pictures'.

Referring to the Channel 4 show 24 Hours in Police Custody last night a message said: 'Father beats his daughter with an iron bar. But he is a good Muslim, prays in his cell & attends the mosque. So that's all happy days then.

'The police are singing from the same hymn sheet. Mohammed is going DAAAAAAAN. Allahu Akbar'.

This was based on last night's show where a father  pleaded guilty to attacking his daughter with an iron, leading to a three-year jail sentence.

One follower replied: 'Oh my, please Katie that's racist', which she retweeted. 

Dozens accused her of inciting racial hatred and demanded the police take action.    

One Twitter follower asked if she was anti-Muslim and tweets from her account  said: 'Allah doesn't guide me. He is not a dog and I am not blind. I see that all religion is evil'.

A modified lyrics tweet sent from Hopkins' account said: 'But say a prayer, Pray for the other ones, At Christmastime it's hard, when you're bleeding from the bum #BandAid30 totes inappropes.

'& in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy, throw your arms around the world at Xmastime. #BandAid30 Dodgy advice for Ebola'.

Upset: Twitter users were furious after the tweets sent from Hopkins' account

Her regular appearances on This Morning allow her to offer her opinion on controversial subjects including 'common' children's names and why the obese are unemployable.

Katie famously embarrassed herself when she claimed that she did not like 'geographical names' when appearing on This Morning to claim that names are linked to class. Philip Schofield then pointed out that her own daughter was called India.

Katie has also come head to head with several celebrities including the late Peaches Geldof and had a series of rows on TV and online.

But when Ms Geldof died of a heroin overdose she waited several says to comment.

The controversial TV personality then made it clear that she felt it would be inappropriate to tweet about Peaches when the deceased mother-of-two wouldn't have appreciated a tweet from her while she was alive.

She said: 'Peaches didn't want a tweet from me. She didn't welcome it in life. She certainly didn't need it in death.

'She was tough enough not to seek approval from anyone.'
