More than 1,000 people gathered at an emotional memorial on Monday night to mourn the 19 elite firefighters who lost their lives battling an Arizona wildfire on Sunday.

Firefighters walked down the bleachers in the gymnasium on the campus of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, their heavy work boots drumming a march on the wooden steps.

They bowed their heads for moments of silence at the front of an auditorium that was so packed organizers had to send people outside for fear of violating the fire code.

The burly men then hugged each other and cried at the end of the deeply emotional memorial in the Arizona mountain town of Prescott.

Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo spoke in a shaky voice at the memorial as he described throwing a picnic a month ago for the department's new recruits and meeting their families.

'About five hours ago, I met those same families at an auditorium,' he said.

'Those families lost. The Prescott Fire Department lost. The city of Prescott lost, the state of Arizona and the nation lost,' he said before receiving a standing ovation as he left the podium.

For the 19 killed, violent wind gusts turned a lightning-caused forest fire into a death trap that left no escape. It was the deadliest day for fire crews since September 11, 2001.

In a desperate attempt at survival, the firefighters - members of a highly skilled Arizona-based Hotshot crew - had unfurled heat-resistant shelters and rushed to cover themselves on the ground.

But the success of the shelters depends on firefighters being in a cleared area away from fuels and not in the direct path of a raging fire.

Only one member of the 20-person crew survived, and that was because he was moving the unit's truck at the time.

The blaze grew from 200 acres to about 2,000 in a matter of hours, and Prescott City Councilman Len Scamardo said the wind and fire made it impossible for the firefighters to flee.

'The winds were coming from the 
southeast, blowing to the west, away from Yarnell and populated areas. 
Then the wind started to blow in, the wind kicked up to 40 to 50 mph 
gusts and it blew east, south, west - every which way,' he said.

'What 
limited information we have was there was a gust of wind from the north 
that blew the fire backed, and trapped them.'

In a heartbreaking sight, a long line 
of vans from a coroner's office carried the bodies of the 19 
firefighters Monday from Yarnell to Phoenix for autopsies, as the fire 
burned out of control.

It 
was zero percent contained by Tuesday and had burned 8,400 acres as a 
heat wave across the Southwest sent temperature soaring.

Authorities are investigating to figure out what exactly went wrong after the wind suddenly changed direction.

Mary Rasmussen, a spokeswoman for the Southwest incident team, said Atlanta NIMO - National Incident Management Organization will be the lead in the probe and will aim to put out a report in the coming days with preliminary information.

The multi-agency group of investigators 
arrived Monday and was being briefed in Phoenix. Judith Downing, a 
spokeswoman for the taskforce, said they would go to the fire scene 
Tuesday.

Southwest incident team leader Clay 
Templin said the crew and its commanders were following safety 
protocols, and it appears the fire's erratic nature simply overwhelmed 
them.

The Hotshot team 
had spent recent weeks fighting fires in New Mexico and Prescott before 
being called to Yarnell, entering the smoky wilderness over the weekend 
with backpacks, chainsaws and other heavy gear to remove brush and 
trees.

Yavapai County said an estimated 200 homes and other structures burned in Yarnell and hundreds of people have been evacuated due to the fire.

About 200 firefighters arrived to the scorching mountains, doubling the number of firefighters battling the blaze, ignited by lightning. Many of them also were part of Hotshot crews.

In addition to the flames, downed power lines and exploding propane tanks continued to threaten what was left of the town, said fire information officer Steve Skurja. A light rain fell over the area but did little in helping crews gain the upper hand fire.

Arizona's governor called Sunday 'as dark a day as I can remember' and ordered flags flown at half-staff.

'I
 know that it is unbearable for many of you, but it also is unbearable 
for me. I know the pain that everyone is trying to overcome and deal 
with today,' said Gov. Jan Brewer, her voice catching several times as 
she addressed reporters and residents at Prescott High School in the 
town of 40,000.

Fraijo said he feared the worst when he received a call Sunday afternoon from someone assigned to the fire.

'All he said was, "We might have bad news. The entire Hotshot crew deployed their shelters",' Fraijo said. 'When we talk about deploying the shelters, that's an automatic fear, absolutely. That's a last-ditch effort to save yourself when you deploy your shelter.'

The 19 killed were Andrew Ashcraft, 29; Kevin Woyjeck, 21; Anthony Rose, 23; Eric Marsh, 43; Christopher MacKenzie, 30; Robert Caldwell, 23; Clayton Whitted , 28; Scott Norris, 28; Dustin Deford, 24; Sean Misner, 26; Garret Zuppiger, 27; Travis Carter, 31; Grant McKee, 21; Travis Turbyfill, 27; Jesse Steed, 36; Wade Parker, 22; Joe Thurston, 32; William Warneke, 25; and John Percin, 24.
