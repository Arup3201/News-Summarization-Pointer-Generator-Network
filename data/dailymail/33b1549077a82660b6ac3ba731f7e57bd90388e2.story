Lashing out: Nikoleta Karoly, 24, was arrested for domestic violence on Saturday night in Naples, Florida

A woman was arrested after trying to choke her boyfriend because he refused to marry her, police said.

Nikoletta Karoly, 24, was charged with domestic violence on Saturday night after she attacked the man because he wouldn't marry her to stop her being deported.

Karoly, who lives in East Naples, Florida had been in a relationship with the man, who was not identified, for two months.Â 

Her immigration visa expired last week according to Naples News and she lost her temper when her boyfriend did not agree to a wedding.

She
slapped him so hard that the man feared he would lost his hearing, a police
report stated and he was covered in scratches.

She then threatened him with a kitchen knife.

Karoly, who is believed to be from Hungary,
told police that his injuries had happened during sex 'because it makes
it better'.

Her boyfriend told authorities he was unsure about marrying Karoly because of her violent temper and that she had punched him in the past when they argued about her visa.

Karoly faces a charge of battery - touch or strike another against their will.
