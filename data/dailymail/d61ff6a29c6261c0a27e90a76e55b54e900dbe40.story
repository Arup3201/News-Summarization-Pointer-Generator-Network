Ronald Koeman had one of the toughest jobs of any Premier League manager this summer as he tried to find replacements for a Southampton team raided of many of its best players. 

At the back he has recruited Toby Alderweireld, who he has known for a decade. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at what makes him special.

New boy: Toby Alderweireld poses in his Southampton shirt after sealing a season-long loan move

Where is he from?

Originally from a district of Antwerp called Wilrijk.

Easy for you to say. Another Belgian in the Premier League, are they staging a takeover?

Perhaps. Alderweireld, who represented his country in Brazil this summer, is the 16th Belgian currently playing in the top division, 13 of whom are full internationals. They could form an entire team, plus extras, or open a really good chocolate factory.

So what are his vital statistics?

He is a 25-year-old, 6ft1in centre back on a loan deal from Atletico Madrid but there is an option to buy for £6.3 million. He can also play right-back, offering additional cover for Calum Chambers after he was sold to Arsenal.

Heads up: The former Ajax man struggled for playing time at Atleti, prompting his move to the Premier League

And can he fill a Dejan Lovren sized hole?

Very possibly. He is a solid and experienced defender with 37 international caps. He can also score, his header against Malaga last season kept Atletico in the hunt for the title.

Why did he want to leave the sunshine of Madrid?

He wasn’t being played as much as he wanted in Spain, having moved from Ajax on a four-year deal in 2013. Toby had been a key part of the Ajax team, but played just 12 matches as Atletico won the La Liga title and got fed up of warming the bench.

Did he want to be beside the seaside, too?

Looks that way. Toby did a tour of the UK – granted not one that is overly prominent in the holiday brouchures – visiting Newcastle and Southampton with both clubs interested as well as Monaco. But he passed on the Baltic and the Mediterranean and opted for the south coast instead.

Fans' favourite: Some supporters in America have created YouTube videos in honour of Alderweireld's hair

Quite right, too. So why did he choose Southampton?

Well, he knows new boss Ronald Koeman from their time at Ajax together. In August 2004, Alderweireld joined the youth academy managed by Koeman, who had spent three years playing for the club before taking charge of its first team in 2001.

What’s his hair all about?

Forget the Bendtner ponytail it’s all about the Alderweireld slick back, famous in its own right. There are even extensive YouTube tutorials made in America, by those with only a passing interest in ‘soccer’ but want their hair just like Toby.
