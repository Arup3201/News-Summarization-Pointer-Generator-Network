The Pope led the world's Roman Catholics in Palm Sunday celebrations by paying tribute to those killed for their faith - a reference to the victims of Islamic State militants. 

Thousands of people, including the 78-year-old Argentine pope and prelates dressed in red vestments, carried palm fronds and branches in St. Peter's Square on the day that marks the start of Holy Week, which ends on Easter Sunday.

In his homily during the Mass that followed, Francis, who last month denounced the killing of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians by Islamic State militants in Libya, paid tribute to those he said were being killed for their faith today.

Waving to the faithful: The Pope led the world's Roman Catholics in Palm Sunday celebrations by paying tribute to those killed for their faith

Thousands of people gathered in St. Peter's Square in the Vatican City on the day that marks the start of Holy Week, which ends on Easter Sunday

Many of those who attended, including the 78-year-old Argentine pope (centre) and prelates dressed in red vestments, carried palm fronds and branches

Speaking out: In his homily during the Mass that followed, Francis paid tribute to those he said were being killed for their faith today

He presided at a colourful procession in St. Peter's Square
commemorating the day the Bible says people of Jerusalem
welcomed Jesus days before he was crucified. 

'We think too of the humiliation endured by all those who,
for their lives of fidelity to the Gospel, encounter
discrimination and pay a personal price,' he said, speaking in
Italian.

'We think too of our brothers and sisters who are persecuted
because they are Christians, the martyrs of our own time. There
are many of them. They refuse to deny Jesus and they endure
insult and injury with dignity,' he said.

Palm Sunday marks the official beginning of Holy Week during which Christians observe the death of Christ

Francis has at times expressed alarm over the rise of
Islamic State militants and the plight of Christians in the
Middle East.

He has said that the international community would be
justified in using military force as a last resort to stop
'unjust aggression' but that it should not be up to a single
nation to decide how to intervene in the conflict.

The coming week is one of the busiest in the liturgical
calendar for the leader of the world's 1.2 billion Roman
Catholics.

Huge crowds assembled at St Peter's Square. Pope Francis used the opportunity to pay tribute to those he said were being killed for their faith

On Holy Thursday, he presides at two services, including one
at a Rome prison where he will wash and kiss the feet of male
and female inmates to commemorate Christ's gesture of humility
towards his apostles on the night before he died.

Francis is the first pope to hold the foot-washing service 
outside a church and to include women and Muslims, which has
upset conservative Catholics.

He presides at two Good Friday services, including a Via
Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession around the Colosseum.

After celebrating Easter Eve and Easter Day Masses he
delivers his 'Urbi et Orbi' (to the city and the world) message.
