An animal sanctuary in Australia has a found novel way of utilising cleaning cloths – using them as blankets for injured bats.

The Australian Bat Clinic and Wildlife Trauma Center near the Gold Coast uses the yellow dusters to comfort orphaned pups.

A video has been released showing worker Trish Wimberley binding up the bats at the facility in Queensland.
