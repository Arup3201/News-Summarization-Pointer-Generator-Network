Fierce fighting raged in eastern Ukraine last night as government forces and Russian-backed rebels each tried to seize territory ahead of today’s crucial peace talks.

Ukrainian troops advanced on rebel frontlines near the seaport of Mariupol, a key coastal position between rebel-controlled areas and the Crimean peninsula.

Russian-backed separatist forces moved to encircle the vital railway hub of Debaltseve, the focus of vicious fighting in past weeks, cutting it off from supply lines. 

It is understood that at least seven Ukrainian troops have been killed in the most recent fighting along with two civilians. A further 12 civilians were injured.

Pensioners and parents with young children  caught in the firing line between Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels backed by Moscow, rifle through piles of donated clothes in Soviet-era army tents.

Crowds of people pack into the cramped shelters next to Slavyansk railway station, which are serving as a base  for a small group of volunteers providing food and clothing to an ever-increasing number of refugees flooding into this once quiet coal mining town in east Ukraine’s war torn Donetsk region.

Inside the tents, haggard looking former residents of Debaltseve and Gorlovka queue for plates of porridge and pickled vegetables, telling harrowing stories of GRAD rocket barrages and life in bomb shelters.

‘A week ago I dislocated my shoulder and had to find a way out,' said native Tatiana, who asked that her surname not be published for fear of recrimination towards family members who remain behind.

'The shelling is constant. There was no way I could stay. My entire family stayed behind. They’re still there. 

'I have no idea if they’re brave or just stupid and don’t understand how serious the situation really is.’ 

With little coordinated help from the international community and an economy in free fall, the Ukrainian government relies on local private donors and volunteers to care for the daily stream of displaced people pouring into areas controlled by units loyal to Kiev.

Life in Debaltseve and nearby Gorlovka – a major rail hub of 300,000 people - has been nothing short of hell on earth for those who have endured months of heavy shelling from both sides.

Since the fall of Donetsk Airport – and with it most of Kiev’s best combat troops - to pro-Russian forces two weeks ago, Debaltseve, in particular, has become the focus of a drawn-out national tragedy.

For the Ukrainian public, the months-long stand at the airport came to represent a modern-day Battle of Thermopylae – with the defenders cast as King Leonidas and his 300 Spartan warriors in a heroic last stand.

For Debaltseve, however, the fate of the beleaguered civilian population and the outnumbered units that continue to hold the line, is rapidly beginning to resemble Sarajevo in the early 1990s.

Pro-Russian rebels have nearly cut the city off, leaving thousands stranded and huddling in makeshift bomb shelters. Rockets and artillery shells are fired indiscriminately from their positions and into the town.

A brief ceasefire last weekend succeeded in most of the population being led to safety, but estimates from most aid agencies place the number of those who stayed behind at as high as 3,000.

Grandmother Lilia Petrovna said: 'The bombing (in Debaltseve) never stops.

'The shells hit homes, schools, parks, it doesn’t matter. My house took a direct hit from a  rocket.

'It was at that moment that the kids’ parents and I decided we should get everyone out.'

With her four grandchildren surrounding her, she added ‘We hope to be here for ten days or so, after that we don’t know where to go.’

Those who remain trapped in the city endure constant shelling and attacks with notoriously inaccurate GRAD multiple rocket launchers. 

Basic amenities have been cut and access corridors out of the city are growing fewer by the day as heavy fighting in and out of the centre becomes fiercer.

The lucky ones who make it to Slavyansk are housed in dusty old railway cars, stinking of coal-heated boilers and barely functional toilets.

These relics of the Soviet Union’s vast railway network are, for now, temporary homes of hundreds of families, many of whom no longer have a standing home to return to or relatives to stay with.

Shelter: Refugees, young and old pack into the cars, each uncertain as to when or if they’ll ever leave

Many others – including the elderly – are left sleeping on the cabins’ cold wood benches.

The older generation, who lived through the horrors of World War II, stoically brave the cold and cramped living conditions. 

Parents do their best to look after their children, while never allowing them to see the deep sense of fear and uncertainty in their eyes.

'We left Gorlovka a day ago because of the fighting,' members of the Vaganov family, who declined to provide their names, said. 'It’s getting worse every day.'

Talks: Obama, at a White House news conference with visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said providing weapons to Ukraine was among the options he and his advisers were considering

Whole families have been uprooted in recent days as the rebels come closer to their objective of fully surrounding Debaltseve.

Today, the Ukrainian national guard has launched an offensive against pro-Russian separatists near the southeastern port city of Mariupol.

The secretary to the National Security and Defence Council, Oleksander Turchynov, 'is near Mariupol, where units of the national guard broke through enemy defences and went on the offensive', a statement from Ukraine's security council said in an online statement. 

Separatist gains against Kiev government forces in eastern Ukraine, particularly a rebel advance on the transport hub of Debaltseve to the northeast of Donetsk, have added impetus to a Franco-German initiative to try to end the crisis.

President Obama signaled on Monday he will wait for the results of high-stakes talks on Ukraine before deciding whether to arm the Kiev government, saying diplomacy and sanctions remain his preferred tools to resolve the crisis.

Obama, at a White House news conference with visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said providing weapons to Ukraine was among the options he and his advisers were considering.

Fighting between pro-Russian rebels and pro-government forces loyal to Kiev has intensified in Ukraine's south east region since the new year

But he made clear he had reservations about upping the ante in Ukraine and endangering U.S.-European unity in the contest of wills with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

Merkel opposes sending weapons to Kiev to help it fight Russian-backed separatists.

'It is true that if, in fact, diplomacy fails, what I've asked my team to do is to look at all options,' Obama said. 'But I have not made a decision about that yet.'

Despite prompting by a German reporter, the U.S. president pointedly declined to lay down a 'red line' that, should Putin cross it, would prompt him to authorise weapons for Ukraine.

In the face of a new offensive by separatists in eastern Ukraine, some of Obama's top advisors, as well as hawkish U.S. lawmakers, are pressing him to do more to help the Ukrainian government defend itself.

But that question has been overshadowed, at least temporarily, by a revived diplomatic push led by Merkel and French President Francois Hollande. 

The pair are due to meet with Putin and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in Belarus tomorrow.

The conflict between Russia-backed separatists and government forces has now killed more than 5,300 people and displaced more than a million.
