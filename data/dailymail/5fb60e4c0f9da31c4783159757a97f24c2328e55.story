Their low prices and special offers are clearly working for cash-strapped shoppers.

For budget stores Aldi and Lidl have beaten Marks & Spencer for the first time in an annual supermarket satisfaction report.

The Which? survey of more than 11,000 members placed Waitrose in first place for the third year running, scoring 83 per cent and praise for its staff and products.

Value: One shopper responding to the survey said Aldi 'surpassed all expectation'

However, the ‘big four’ supermarkets – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – failed to impress as much as discount alternatives Aldi and Lidl, which were ranked second and third respectively. Marks & Spencer came fourth.

Meanwhile, Tesco and the Co-operative, were given the the joint lowest score of 46 per cent.

Aldi and Lidl were both praised for the quality of their fresh produce and value in the Which? survey of 11,000 members. One shopper said: ‘I’m a new Aldi shopper and it’s surpassed all expectation.’

1. Waitrose 83%2. Aldi 72%3. Lidl 68%4. M&S 67%5. Morrisons 60%6. Sainsbury’s 57%7. Asda 51%8. Tesco 46%9. The Co-operative 46%

The former was awarded just two out of 
five stars on a range of subjects including customer service, own brand 
products and store environment.

A spokesman for The Co-operative said: 'Clearly we are disappointed by these results, but we are working hard to modernise the business and are investing heavily in improving all aspects of our offer, including product quality and availability.

'This is already paying off with our premium Truly Irresistible range scoring well.'

Which? executive director Richard 
Lloyd said: 'The tough economy and rising food prices have seen 
cash-strapped consumers heading to the discounters for their low prices 
and special offers.

Fourth place: M&S ranked lower than budget stores Aldi and Lidl

'Aldi
and Lidl have climbed to second and third place this year, overtaking 
Marks & Spencer. And this doesn’t mean compromising on taste, as our
tests show they sell a range of products that compete with the premium 
brands.'

A Tesco spokesman said: 'We’re disappointed and a little surprised by these results.

'They
don’t tally with our own measures of customer satisfaction or our 
experience in talking to some of the millions of people who shop in 
store and online with us every week.

'We want to keep our customers happy and invest hugely in doing so, by offering great value, providing excellent quality products and by constantly developing new products and services to meet changing customer demand.'
