If anyone knows how hard it is to make a fortune, it’s former Dragons’ Den star Theo Paphitis, who clawed his way up from humble beginnings as a tea boy.

Which is why the retail tycoon won’t be depriving his children of their multi-million pound inheritance, fearing they wouldn’t be able to cope without the luxury lifestyle he has given them.

Paphitis, 54, who is worth £180million, said he disagrees with other millionaires such as his former co-star on the BBC2 show Duncan Bannatyne, who insist they won’t pass on their fortune to their children because it would ‘ruin’ them.

Paphitis, who has five children with his wife Debbie, said that suddenly taking away their privileged lifestyles risked ‘driving them to places you don’t want them to go’.

He said: ‘My view is very simple. I’m a traditionalist, a family man, I love my kids. I believe I have brought them up the right way. They are all very  different, they have different drives, different ambitions. They are never going to be me. They are going to be themselves.

‘We support each other and there is no reason why I shouldn’t support my children. I, on the other hand, had absolutely nothing, apart from the love of my parents. You make your kids what they are, so what do you do?

‘Do you not get them used to a lifestyle? What happens when they become 18 and they are used to a certain lifestyle and then you say, “I’m going to take it away?”

‘How do you know they are capable of coping with that? How do you know that’s not going to drive them somewhere to a place you don’t want them to go anywhere near because of it? You can’t do that.’

Paphitis, who used to ask contestants on Dragons’ Den, ‘Why should I spend my children’s inheritance on that?’ has three daughters and two sons, Dominic, 34, actress Zoe, 32, Alex, 26, and twins Holly and Annabelle, 17.

The son of Greek Cypriot immigrants, Paphitis started work aged 15 as assistant to the tea boy at brokers Lloyd’s of London.

Just seven years later he had set up his first business. He now owns hardware chain Robert Dyas, stationers Ryman and set up lingerie brand Boux Avenue two years ago.

He is also the face of the Government’s auto-enrolment pension initiative.

In 2009 Bannatyne said he will not leave a penny of his vast fortune to his children, claiming he will leave it to charity instead. He suggested it would ‘not be good for them’ to inherit such a large sum.
