A top Sixties model is suing makers of the hit TV show Mad Men for using her image without consent in the opening credits, it emerged today.

The stunning image of Gita Hall May, well-known for her eye-catching red hair, is seen projected on a skyscraper in the Emmy-winning show's iconic opening credits.

During the show's title music a silhouette of an 'ad man' is seen falling among the Manhattan skyline with famous adverts shown all around him. May's image is included and comes from an advert she did for Revlon hairspray in the 1950s.

Controversy: Gita Hall May is suing Lionsgate for this image in the opening credits of Mad Men. The sequence shows an image of the model, pictured, she claims was used without her consent

In a complaint filed to Los Angeles Superior Court on Friday, showbiz website Deadline reports, Hall May. 79, claimed Mad Men studio Lionsgate failed to request her permission to use the image shot by famous fashion photographer Richard Avedon. 

'I wished they had had the courtesy to get in touch with me,” she told ABC News on Monday.

'I was surprised because nobody had checked with me about it– they must have thought I was dead.'

She says the now well-known opening sequence put together by design firm Imaginary Forces helped the drama, starring January Jones and John Hamm, become a success. 

'At no time did she agree to allow, forty years later, her image to be cropped from the photo, in secret, and inserted as a key element in the title sequence of a cable television series, without her consent and for commercial purposes,' her complaint says.  

'The Main Titles were integral to the success of Mad Men'.

Upset: Hall said on a morning show that no one tried to get in touch with her and she assumes they thought she must be dead

It goes on to point out the titles themselves won an Emmy and the show's producers have made in excess of $1billion as a result of the series' success.  

May says she only became aware of the use of her image last May despite it appearing in the credits since the show's pilot in 2007.

She claims the show used her image to give the series credibility.

'Defendants sought to include the likeness of a famous celebrity from the 1950s in the credits in order to promote and burnish the image of the show in the eyes of the public and to create the 'feel' of the program that was critical to its commercial success... Defendants sought Plaintiff's image because she was among the top models of her day,' the lawsuit says.

Lionsgate were unavailable to comment on the legal action which seeks unspecified damages.

Gita Hall May, 79, was a former Miss Sweden who became an actress and model.

She was famously married to the actor Barry Sullivan and appeared in numerous adverts and fashion magazines throughout the fifties and sixties shot by photographers such as Avedon and Irving Penn.
