Clutching a bottle of drink, grinning broadly and struggling to carry an armful of shoes, this woman was today one of many new riot suspects being hunted by police.

In another image a man in Hackney stands in the road holding a house brick, not bothered by the fact his other arm is in a plaster cast and sling.

The images are just two of more than 80 police released today in a bid to hunt down every last suspected rioter and looter who took to the streets earlier in the week.

Despite initial fears that associates of the suspects would not want to 'snitch', the public have been 'inundating' the police with information about the swathes of yobs who ransacked England's streets, shops and homes.

Another picture shows a man with tattoos decorating his right arm, grasping what appears to be a jagged glass bottle.

All have been published by the Metropolitan Police, who are appealing to the public for help identifying people wanted in connection with the violent crimes that destroyed parts of the capital.

So far they have made a 
staggering 1,271 arrests and charged 745 people in connection with the 
widespread looting and violence.

As part of Operation Withern which is dealing specifically with the unrest they have set up a website, publishing 88 new images of those wanted in connection with the crimes that have shocked the country and the rest of the world.

Police in Manchester have been 'inundated' with tip-offs from the public in response to their 'Shop A Looter' campaign, the force say.

Greater Manchester Police said today that there had been 208 arrests so far in connection with the rioting and 134 people had been charged.

Hoods, tattoos and big hair: Another half dozen suspects police want to identify

Pictures of suspected rioters are being 
displayed on huge advertising vans being driven around Manchester and 
neighbouring Salford, where hundreds took part in disorder earlier this 
week.

And while this resort is helping to identify suspects it is also prompting those involved to turn themselves in.

A youth handed himself in after his friend saw his picture on the ad vans and called him to say his image was all over Manchester and he had no place to hide, a GM police spokesman said.

And in Birmingham a mother frogmarched her 15-year-old daughter to the police station after she saw CCTV images of her released by police.

Also among the new arrests was a 14-year-old boy who was detained by Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan, who also recovered stolen trainers with the tags still on.

The boy, who cannot be named, remains in custody on suspicion of burglary following a theft at the Foot Locker store in Manchester city centre.

Mr Shewan said: 'We said we would be coming for you, and we are.

'Within minutes of the ad van being launched in Manchester with the faces of some of those people involved, we have been inundated with information from members of the public about who these people are.

'These are just some of the good 
arrests we have made. I have been told of countless more by officers who
 are using every piece of information and every available avenue to find
 these people and bring them in.

'With
 the help of our communities we are identifying these people and 
arresting them. This is just the start - we will not rest until we have 
identified everyone involved.'

West Midlands Police said they have arrested 509 people in connection with the disturbances, including 42 in the last 24 hours.

A spokesman for the force said 
officers on a raid found £30,000 in cash and arrested a 20-year-old 
woman believed to have been involved in looting at Birmingham's Armani 
store.

He added that one 
woman from Handsworth had escorted her 15-year-old daughter to a police 
station having recognised her image in a CCTV media appeal.

To deal with the stream of those charged, courts have been throughout the weekend.

Magistrates,
 clerks, ushers, lawyers and security guards have been working 
consecutively for the last four nights to hear riot-related cases.

An 18-year-old who broke into a London jeweller's shop during last week's riots handed himself in to police 
after his picture was published in the media.

Aaron Douglas went to Kennington 
police station in south London accompanied by his sister to surrender 
after being persuaded by his family, City of Westminster Magistrates' 
Court heard.

Today, he admitted breaking into 
Crystal Palace Jewellers in Church Road, Upper Norwood, south east 
London, and stealing goods worth £6,100 in the early hours of August 9.

The attack on the store came in the form of two raids - the first by 10 males who were later joined by a gang of 20 yobs.

Catherine Wear, prosecuting, said 
Douglas, of Gibbs Square, Norwood Park, was caught on CCTV lifting up a 
security shutter to help other raiders in and out.

He will be sentenced at Inner London Crown Court on an unspecified date after the hearing was adjourned for reports.

Meanwhile there is growing friction between politicians and police as Chancellor George Osborne signalled the Government's determination to press ahead with cuts to police budgets.

He said that dealing with the violent disorder meant tackling 'deep-seated social problems', not scaling back austerity measures.

'We are committed to the plan we have set out for police reform,' he told the BBC - insisting that a 20 per cent real-terms budget cut need not reduce 'visible' policing.

'But this is not just about police budgets; this is about a far bigger challenge for our society, which is dealing with people who we have ignored for too long and helping them feel they have a stake in society.'

He strongly backed the decision by Prime Minister David Cameron to bring in US 'Supercop' William Bratton as an adviser on how to prevent a repeat of the riots.

The recruitment of the former New York police chief, who also dealt with riots in Los Angeles in 1992, has increased tension between politicians and the police.
