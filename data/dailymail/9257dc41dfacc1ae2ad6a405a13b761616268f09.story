Sir Mark Thatcher was among the dignitaries at the inauguration of a square in Madrid named after his mother, Margaret.

The businessman, chief mourner at his mother’s funeral last April, yesterday helped unveil the Plaza Margaret Thatcher in Madrid yesterday, accompanied by the city’s mayor Ana Botella and the British Ambassador to Spain Simon Manley. 

Madrid mayor Ana Botella proposed naming a street or square in the Spanish capital after the Iron Lady just a day after she died from a stroke aged 87 at London’s Ritz Hotel.

The move was criticised by opposition politicians, with the city’s Socialist leader at the time claiming Thatcher was a 'pioneer of a good part of that which had caused most inequality and injustice in Europe'. 

The memorial is close to Madrid’s  Colon Square in the city centre near to the National Library and Hard Rock Cafe.

‘I don’t know of any other places named after Margaret Thatcher before or after her death,’ says Mark Worthington, her former private secretary.

‘I don’t think there are any in Britain either.'

Last September former Tory PM John Major unveiled a street named after him in Cancelada, two hours' drive west of Madrid.

Mr Major has holidayed in the small village for the last 25 years and stays at a country house owned by friend and former Conservative Party colleague Tristan Garel-Jones.

Mr Garel-Jones, minister of Europe under John Major, translated his acceptance speech into Spanish for him at the unveiling ceremony after the former PM admitted he was an 'idle, lazy linguist' and only could say ‘gracias’.
