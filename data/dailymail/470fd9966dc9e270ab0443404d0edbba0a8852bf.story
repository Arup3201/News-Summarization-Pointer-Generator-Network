British police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann are set to return to Portugal next month after petitioning authorities for more help

Police probing Madeleine McCann's disappearance have formally petitioned for more help, Portuguese authorities have revealed.

Another international letter of request has been received from Scotland Yard, Portugal's Attorney General's Office confirmed.

The news comes as  officers prepare for a new trip to the Algarve next month following ground searches for missing Madeleine and interrogations of four suspects earlier this summer.

Officials have declined to comment on the content of the new letter of request.

It was not clear last night if public prosecutors on the Algarve coordinating the separate Portuguese inquiry into Madeleine's May 2007 disappearance have yet approved the request.

Previous requests - which sparked digs at three sites in and around the Praia da Luz resort where Madeleine vanished as well as the police quizzes - were submitted in July last year and January, February and May this year.

A spokesman for the Lisbon-based Attorney General's Office confirmed last night: 'During the last few weeks Public Prosecution Services received from the British authorities a new Letter of Request in the context of the investigations related to the disappearance of young Madeleine McCann.

'The content of the request presented by the British authorities is classified, therefore the Prosecutor General's Office have no comments on such matter.'

Reports at the weekend suggested British police working on Operation Grange - the new probe into Madeleine's disappearance - want to conduct interviews with more key suspects.

Four men were interviewed as 'arguidos' - normally translated as 'formal suspects' - in July. Only one of them - Russian-born Sergey Malinka - is understood to have had his arguido status removed.

British police questioned them through Portuguese colleagues in the hope of confirming their theory they were part of a burglary gang who panicked after killing Madeleine during a bungled break-in at her family's holiday apartment and dumped her body.

But all four men insisted they had nothing to do with her disappearance and were released without charge. A string of witnesses were also quizzed at Faro Police Station.

South Wales-loaned sniffer dogs were used in June to search waste ground in Praia da Luz in a fruitless search for clues to her whereabouts and are subsequently thought to have swept the car of one of the suspects' relatives.

Portuguese police have privately dismissed the latest British police work as 'senseless.'

They believe Madeleine was snatched by a foreigner no longer in Portugal, although they have still not ruled out the involvement of an ex-drug addict burglar who died in a tractor accident in 2009, three years after being sacked from the holiday club where the British youngster disappeared.

Euclides Monteiro's widow Luisa Rodrigues has insisted her recovering drug addict partner, a convicted burglar, had nothing to do with Madeleine's disappearance.
