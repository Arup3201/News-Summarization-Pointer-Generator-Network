If this was the last-chance saloon then Rafael was the life and soul of the party with a standout performance as Manchester United's Under 21s drew 1-1 with Tottenham.

The Brazilian right back, 24, is said to be fighting for his future at Old Trafford after struggling to impress manager Louis van Gaal.

He has made just nine appearances this term and was an unused substitute for the 2-1 FA Cup defeat to Arsenal on Monday after being left out of the squad altogether for the previous two matches against Sunderland and Newcastle - despite overcoming injury.

But he showed no sign of rustiness in the kind of all-action display that has seen him become a cult hero at Old Trafford.

In a first-half in which he, unlike fellow senior Radamel Falcao, rarely put a foot wrong Rafael brought the house down with a delightful goal.

With United trailing to Kenny McEvoy's neat opener, the defender intercepted a throw from Spurs keeper Luke McGee, chesting it down before clipping a delightful lob over the same man from 30 yards with his left foot.

It brought a youthful house down - and was a timely reminder of his attacking talents in front of a watching assistant manager Ryan Giggs.

United are understood to be open to offers for Rafael with a number of clubs in his homeland said to be leading the charge.

But pressure will be growing on current incumbent Antonio Valencia after his poor performance in Monday's 2-1 home FA Cup quarter final defeat to Arsenal.

Rafael will have done his cause no harm, although remaining on the field for 90 minutes would not appear to be a good omen.

If nothing else, he may well have earned himself a stay of execution as Van Gaal's search for a winning formula rumbles on.
