Airline food does not have the best reputation. 

From stodgy meals to unrecognisable dishes, it seems everyone has a horror story about being served up inedible food on flights.

And some even go as far as taking a picture of their unappetising snack and uploading it to the website AirlineMeals.net to warn others about the questionable dishes.

AirlineMeals gives people the platform to share their dining delights. This United Flight roll from Japan to America in October 2014 was not met with happiness

This offering from Ryanair did not go down a treat. While we are a fan of cheese, Ryanair have created a swimming pool of cheesy sauce for the limp burger 

When Delta Air Lines decided to serve this sun dried tomato sandwich, they were met with horror by the flying customer, who had to put it back in the bag 

Unappetising: This China Eastern selection failed to impress the customer who received it, although at least there was a variety of choices

Unhappy with Utair. This disgruntled passenger rated gave this dry 'scanty sandwich' a 1/10 rating on the site. Not the most appetising sandwich we have seen

You would be forgiven from thinking this slimy peach dessert was a slug. It is fact the dish on offer onboard a Ukraine International flight

From 'toxic' salad to pasta that looks three days old and even 'untouchable' fish dishes, the hall of shame seems almost unending and will soon have you reaching for the sick bag.

AirlineMeals was created over ten years ago, by Marco ‘t Hart and allows users to upload their food and rate it out of ten. There are now over 34,000 pictures on the site, covering 680 airlines from every corner of the globe. 

Some of the uploads are singing the praises of the dishes and others shouting their displeasure. 

't Hart said he created the site after his mother asked what plane food he had when he travelled between Amsterdam and Istanbul to see his girlfriend. 

He started the website with his photographs, and added some from other fliers, with their permission. Soon he had millions of views and thousands of uploaded meals.

'We used the lowest ratings for a while... that used to be fun, but we now focus on the quality airlines offer. We need friends within the industry, not enemies,' he said. 

Despite this focus, AirlineMeals still shows the contributor's score out of ten and honest comments. 

North Korea's Air Koryo served this burger, with a few sad-looking leaves of lettuce, to an unhappy victim on a flight

This Vietnam Airlines meal, with the meat tossed on top of a watery sauce, looks less than appealing for the consumer

This Hawaiian Airlines dish served in December 2014 appears to be missing a few ingredients, although at least they have tried to garnish it with some decorative parsley

The mother of the boy who received this pancake onboard a KLM flight (Royal Dutch Airlines) said he called it 'gross' and refused to eat it - we aren't sure we would eat it either!

This Cyprus Airways bland ham and cheese sandwich gained a 5/10 on the site and was described as 'nothing special'

The AirlineMeals creator said that usually the bigger airlines from the Middle East, (Emirates, Qatar Airways, Gulf Air) and the Far East (All Nippon, JAL) get the best scores.

In Europe, some of the smaller airlines, such as airBaltic, and larger European airlines including BA, Virgin, KLM, Lufthansa, Turkish Airlines, hold their own on the site too. 

In December, US-based DietDetective.com Charles Platkin revealed the results of a survey about airline food showing Virgin America was the best for nutrition, followed by Air Canada and Alaska Airlines. 

Ryanair served this disappointing meatball sub to a guest, who promptly uploaded to name and shame the airline 

Thai Airways International: 'This was the most disgusting and bland meal I have ever tried to eat on an aircraft. The egg was gross, the beef was dry and flavourless and the salad smelled toxic. I only ate the cake which was decent'

The user who tried this dish with Saudi Arabian Airlines described this green tinged mashed potato as 'ugly'

Bangkok Airways served this 'cold and tasteless' dish of glass noodle salad with shrimp on its flight from Thailand to Cambodia to the dismay of a queasy guest 

'The appetiser is untouchable...smoked marlin with Belgian endives, baby green and capsicum,' said the uploader of this oily dish who flew with Cathay Pacific

A customer onboard a Thomson Airways flight was not happy with his frozen gouda sandwich, on his flight between Greece and United States

Elaborate dining with Utair: The recipient probably had other expectations in mind when they selected the cheese and biscuits spread, and gave the food 1/10 for taste and quality. 

'The pasta was like three days old' according to one Aegean Airlines user who tried this dry, bland dish on their flight from Germany to Greece in 2015

However, clearly airlines still have a long way to go to make their meals palatable.

A user on board a Thai Airways International flight posted an image on Airlinemeals.net writing: 'This was the most disgusting and bland meal I have ever tried to eat on an aircraft. The egg was gross, the beef was dry and flavourless and the salad smelled toxic. I only ate the cake which was decent.'

Another flier with Cathay Pacific described the appetiser as 'untouchable' and 'cheap.' 

One guest aboard a Singapore Airlines flight echoed this in their review and said the 'dry fish' was  'bordering inedible.'  

This Singapore Airlines dry fish was described by the user as 'bordering inedible', during a flight from South Africa (JNB) to Singapore (SIN), 26 Oct 2014

A man on an Iran Air was confused his omelette had been served with limp mushrooms and... crisps?
