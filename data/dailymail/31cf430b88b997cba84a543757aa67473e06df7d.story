Sports Illustrated starlet Gigi Hadid has opened up about her on-again-off-again beau, Australian singer Cody Simpson, in a bid to set the record straight following months of speculation over their split.

'I love Cody to death and he loves me,' the blonde model told WWD. 'He needed his time to focus on his music and he’s the one who broke up with me. We’re still best friends and I’ll always respect him and support his career.'

Since that interview, the couple briefly reignited their romance when Gigi, 19, joined Cody, 17, on his European tour this month. Only today, however, Cody told Australia's The Morning Show: 'It's complicated. I guess I'm on the market again.'

On-off: Model Gigi Hadid, 19, said of her ex-boyfriend, singer Cody Simpson, 17, (pictured together in March), 'He needed his time to focus on his music and he's the one who broke up with me'

Single girl: Despite a brief romantic reunion since that interview, Cody re-confirmed the split today, claiming 'I guess I'm on the market again,' which leaves Gigi (pictured on a shoot today) officially a free agent again

In the candid interview, the buxom model - whose mother is Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Foster - also dropped mentions of a few of her other A-list buddies.

Gigi refers to bisexual model Ireland Baldwin as 'genuinely one of my best friends,' chiefly because Ireland understands both Gigi's Los Angeles and New York 'sides.'

Kendall and Kylie Jenner are other close - albeit newer- friends, having met them the week before the May 5 Met Gala in New York, where she says they partied the night away at Rihanna's post-bash.

And there are evidently no hard feelings between Gigi and new pal Kylie, despite the fact that Kylie has also previously dated Cody. 'It's funny,' she says of the cross-over.

Then there is pop sensation Justin Bieber, 20; a close friend and tour-buddy of Cody's, who Gigi describes as 'a good friend.'

'I was on 
the Bieber tour for two weeks. It’s gross. You have to get used to not showering'

'I was on the Bieber tour for two weeks,' she reveals. 'It was crazy but so fun. I’m like one of the guys on tour, on a bus with ten dudes.

'It’s gross. You have to get used to not showering. They’re like, “How do you look so glam?” I’m like, “Dry shampoo.”'

Gigi strenuously denies recent rumors that she and Justin 'flirted' on his boat in Cannes, France, earlier this year but added: 'I think you have to pick your battles.'

As for her blossoming modeling career, Gigi is clearly at the top of her game; and she's been honing her skills for quite some time.

The well-connected teen scored campaigns with Guess when she was a baby and then again as a child; claiming that the label's co-founder Paul Marciano decided she was going to be his 'next whatever' before she was even out of diapers.

Her mother Yolanda yanked her out of the spotlight for the rest of her childhood and well into her teens, banning her from signing with her agency IMG until she was 17. 'She knew the industry was going to judge me,' Gigi says.

Friends in high places: Gigi is a firm favorite of industry heavyweight Carine Roitfeld (center right), who cast her on the cover of her magazine CR Fashion Book (left)

In two short years, she has become a favorite face of former French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld, who now heads up CR Fashion Book.

'I feel like I meet with Carine every week'

'I feel like I meet with Carine every week because I feel like I have a shoot with her all the time,' Gigi reveals. 'She really pushes me, she believes in me and we connect really well.

'Hopefully, my work ethic and stuff keeps me around her. I’m so grateful to have her.'

She has many fans and many faces, but who is the real Gigi Hadid? 'I’m so goofy and super weird,' she says.
