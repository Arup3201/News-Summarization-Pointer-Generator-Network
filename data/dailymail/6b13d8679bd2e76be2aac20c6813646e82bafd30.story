The body of a Florida restaurant owner has been found six days after he disappeared while diving into the Ganges to save a holiday-maker.

Hector Rolotti, who ran the popular Novecento chain, which has four restaurants in Miami, had been on a yoga retreat in India with his wife, Mora Barber, when he was swept away.

The 47-year-old was one of six people who jumped into the river on Monday, after seeing a member of the retreat crying out for help.

For a week search teams had searched sections of the river near Rishikesh, where Rolotti was last seen, in the hope of finding him.

Success: Rolotti opened the the first of many restaurants at the age of 24

Because the father-of-three was physically fit, family and friends had held out a glimmer of hope that he had somehow survived, after being pulled under by the strong current.

On Saturday, his restaurant group released a statement saying the Argentinian-born restaurateur's body had been found.

'It is with great sadness that Novecento
 Group informs that the body of founding parter Hector Rolotti was found
 in the Ganges River,' the statement, published in the Miami Herald, said.

'The body 
was found intact due to the low temperatures of the Ganges this time of 
year. He was found by a group of locals who then alerted the authorities
 and search team.'

Rolotti and his wife had been on a yoga retreat, which they attended every year.

The
 couple had been in India for about a week, and were due to return this 
weekend.

Instead, Rolotii will now be cremated before his ashes are 
returned to Miami and Argentina.

Friends and colleagues paid tribute to Rolotti at the weekend, remembering him as 'a tireless entrepreneur and family man, always concerned about his children, wife and parents'.

A customer at one of his Florida restaurants commented on his efforts to save a friend, telling CBS Miami: 'I think it’s heroic and very inspirational and hopefully his journey in the afterlife is taking him somewhere else pleasant.'

A statement from the restaurant read: 'Hector’s great 
achievement with Novecento was much more than a restaurant chain, it is a
 meeting point for friends and communities.'

Rolotti was just 24 when he opened his first Novecento restaurant in SoHo. He had left Argentina for New York and, by 1991 had founded the first of many successful establishments.

His philosophy behind what made a great restaurant, he told Argentinian newspaper La Voz del Interior, was to create a place where 'people can meet friends or do business'.

'Just providing food doesn’t make it. You have to offer more, you have to set up places people want to meet,' he said.

Rolotti went on to open 13 branches of his restaurant, including four in Miami, two in Mexico, five in Argentina, and one in Uruguay.
