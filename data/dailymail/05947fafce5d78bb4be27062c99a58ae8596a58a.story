A six-week-old cheetah cub at San Diego Zoo Safari Park is spending lots of time with his new best friend - a puppy dog.

The young cheetah called Ruuxa was chosen to be raised as an animal ambassador at the safari park after it was rejected by its mother and had to be hand raised by keepers.

Cheetahs are usually born in litters of three to five cubs.

When a singleton is born, the mother often rejects the cub since the chance of the cub surviving in the wild is small.

The cheetah cub and puppy, a seven-week-old Rhodesian ridgeback called Raina, have been introduced by animal care staff.

The puppy will be raised with the cheetah and serve as his lifelong companion.

Animal training manager Susie Ekard said: 'Because the cheetah was by himself and did not have any siblings we wanted him to have a companion immediately.

'They definitely like to play, and when they take naps together, they often will snuggle up together for that warmth and closeness.'

Safari Park cheetahs selected for training as ambassadors are paired early in life with a domestic dog. 

As the two companions grow up together, the dog’s body language will communicate to the cheetah that there’s nothing to fear in new or public surroundings which relaxes and calms the cheetah. 

The Safari Park currently has four cheetah ambassadors all of which are trained to participate in the Park’s Cheetah Run experience.
