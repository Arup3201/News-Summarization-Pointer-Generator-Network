In a debate watched online by more than a million people, Bill Nye the Science Guy took on Genesis-believer Ken Ham is a debate on earth's origins.

Ham said the world was created in seven days as explained in the Bible, while Nye argued that the earth resulted from the big bang and teaching children otherwise would lead to America's demise as a world power.

'If we continue to eschew science ... we are not going to move forward,' Nye said. 'We will not embrace natural laws. We will not make discoveries. We will not invent and innovate and stay ahead.'

Well-attended: The debate was held at the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky, which was founded by Ham. It was estimated that more than a million people streamed the debate online and 900 people were in the audience

The debate took place Tuesday night to a packed house of 900 at the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky - which Ham founded.

Nye, popular for his 90s TV show 'Bill Nye the Science Guy', agreed to the debate and the museum paid his estimated 50-75,000 speaking fees.

The museum charged $25 per ticket which didn't come close to covering the cost of the debate, though they hope to make up money be selling DVDs of the event.

Learning can be fun: On his show, Bill Nye explained scientific theories in an entertaining way. The show ran from 1993 to 1998

After five-minute opening statements, both Ham and Nye had half an hour to give prepared speeches on how they believe Earth originated, backing their arguments with photos and charts.

The tame debate was moderated by CNN Reporter Tom Foreman, who rarely interrupted the pair, and the audience was mostly quiet except to applaud the debaters at the end of their speeches. 

During his argument, Ham stressed that there exists a difference between 'observational science' and 'historical science'.

Observational
 science is what you can see and test through experiments, and 
historical science is what you can interpret about the past based on 
existing evidence.

But Nye countered that argument, saying that the natural laws observed today hold just as true in the past.

Nye
 points to evidence like Antarctic ice cores that have recorded seasonal
 highs and lows in temperatures dating back 680,000 years to disprove 
Ham's argument that the Earth was created just 6,000 years ago.

And
 if the Great Flood really happened as explained in the story of Noah's 
Ark, there should be Kangaroos in the Middle East or between there and 
Australia.

In
 the end, Nye said it was fine to have faith in a religion but that 
doesn't mean you can't believe in scientific theories as well.

'I
 just want to remind us all there are billions of people in the world 
who are deeply religious, who get enriched by the wonderful sense of 
community by their religion,'Nye said. 'But these same people do not 
embrace the extraordinary view that the Earth is somehow only 6,000 
years old.'

Ham argued a 
similar sentiment, pointing to several famous scientists who have 
publically stated that they believe in creation - including MRI inventor
 Ray Damadian.

'I believe the word 'science' has been hijacked by secularists,' Ham said.

Atheist
 Misty Brewer of Tulsa, Oklahoma drove the 12 hours to Kentucky with her
 son to see the talk, and said the debate was impossible to win

'I
 think the believers will stay believers,' Ms Brewer told USA Today. 'No
 one's going to walk out of here saying, "I changed my mind." That's not
 going to work.'

Attraction: The Creation Museum was founded seven years ago and since then half a million people have visited the $35million facility in Petersburg, Kentucky

While
 many on Twitter expressed the opinion that Nye won the debate, 
academics who believe in evolution say in the end Nye only helped Ham 
publicize his museum.

The
 museum is currently fundraising to build a $60million Noah's Ark theme 
park in Grant County, Kentucky but was previously having a  hard time 
getting the project going.

'Nye's
 appearance will be giving money to organizations who try to subvert the
 mission Nye has had all his life: science education, particularly of 
kids,' Jerry Coyne, professor of ecology and evolution at the University
 of Chicago wrote on his blog.

Nye
 and Ham had never met before the debate last night, though museum 
officials say Nye showed up outside once to take a picture and never 
came in.

He agreed to debate Ham after the two got into a previous debate over creationism online.

Different stories: A human woman is pictured living at the same time as dinosaurs in another exhibit, though scientists argue that humans didn't evolve until after the extinction of dinosaurs

In 2012, Nye posted a video urging parents not to teach their children creationism, even if they themselves believe it.

'I
 say to the grown-ups, if you want to deny evolution and live in your 
world, in your world that's completely inconsistent with everything we 
observe in the universe, that's fine,' Nye said in the video. 'But don't
 make your kids do it, because we need them.'

Ham responded with a video of his own, arguing the Genesis-friend young-earth theory.

Ham,
 who is the head of creationist group Answers in Genesis, helped found 
the museum seven years ago and since then the $35million facility has 
been visited by half a million visitors.

Inside
 the museum, animatronic dinosaurs are depicted living amongst humans, 
and displays of fossils date back no further than 2400 BC when the Great
 Flood reportedly occurred.

Other
 exhibits explain how radioisotope dating can yield inaccurate age 
estimates and how teaching evolution can lead to social problems.

The museum employs 300 people with a budget of $30million.
