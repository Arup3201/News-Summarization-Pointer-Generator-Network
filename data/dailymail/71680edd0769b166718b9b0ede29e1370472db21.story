Manchester City’s Samir Nasri has quit international football after a breakdown in his relationship with manager Didier Deschamps and some of the French players.

Nasri, who was controversially left out of France‘s squad for this summer’s World Cup in Brazil, made his decision after alleging that some of his international team-mates had criticised him behind his back. He said ‘My family suffered from this and I don’t want them to suffer.

‘With the French national team, I don’t feel like it anymore. I don’t want to be there. I am not happy, I don’t want to go there any more.’

Nasri, 27, has been involved in a number of previous incidents connected with playing for France.

He launched a foul-mouthed rant at journalists after his country’s exit from Euro 2012 against Spain and earlier this year girlfriend Anara Atanes aimed expletives at Deschamps on Twitter after he left Nasri out of his group for South America.

On the eve of Sunday's Community Shield game at Wembley against former club Arsenal, Nasri tried to outline his decision to retire after 41 caps.

‘I’ve been thinking about it since the 2012 European Championship. This is just a confirmation of what I’ve been feeling,' he said.

‘Let’s face it, as long as he (Deschamps) is going to be the manager I don’t think I have a shot after everything that happened.

‘He said he didn’t pick me for the World Cup because I wasn’t happy on the bench, but I don’t know one player who is happy on the bench, especially when you don’t understand the reason.’

Nasri insisted he would not return for Les Bleus even if Deschamps left and a new manager came in.

‘The French national team doesn’t make me happy. Every time I go there, it’s more trouble. I face accusations and my family suffer for it, and I don’t want to make them suffer. I think it’s wiser to stop it and focus on my club career.

‘It’s not just about the manager. He did what he thought was best for his team at the World Cup.

‘The press in France reported that other players were complaining about me. Why would I want to be in a group where other players can’t even be honest and tell me to my face if they have a problem with me.

‘I really love everything about football and I’ve played it since I was five-years-old. I just want to have as much pleasure as possible and with the French national team, I don’t feel like it any more. So it’s better to be focussed on Manchester City.’

A leading French TV presenter said before the World Cup that Nasri brought a “disease to the squad” and that team-mates didn’t like his attitude around the camp.

Nasri signed a new five-year contract with City this summer and will look to add to a trophy haul that already includes two Premier League titles and a Capital One Cup.

He says he is a more mature person now than the youngster who wound up people earlier in his career.

‘I’ve made some mistakes like everyone but I’ve learned and don’t want to repeat them. So I am trying to be more calm, more relaxed about everything and just enjoy every day because I know I am lucky to be a footballer.’

Samir Nasri was speaking at Manchester City’s Community Shield Media Day at Carrington, where he joined in to helped the Club’s Community Coaches train children from local schools and sports clubs.
