St George's flags were out in force from all around the country inside Tallinn's Le Coq Arena. Tamworth, Burnley, Stoke, Oxford, and Redditch were among the towns represented with many flags, like Blackpool FC, displaying the club name – emphasising you can support your club and country. 

Good also to hear shushing among the travelling fans before the Estonian national anthem was played, ensuring it was listened to with quiet respect rather than any jeers or catcalls from the away end.

This was England's first qualifying game played on a Sunday since a 3-0 win in Moldova in September 1996. It was memorable for being Glenn Hoddle's first competitive game as England manager, and an international debut for David Beckham. Wonder what happened to him?

Northerly Tallinn is more Scandinavia meets Eastern Europe than stereotypical old Iron Curtain. The atmosphere was joyful rather than aggressive and intimidating than in some former Russian Republics. The home supporters had their own brass band and big drum, though strangely their most popular chant 'Eesti, Eesti (Estonia)' initially sounded like 'Emile Hes-key' to untrained ears.

Joe Hart is one of the most commanding goalkeepers in Europe but his achilles heel at the moment is his goal kicking. Managers from Fabio Capello onwards have noted it and it wasn't his greatest for distribution. One clearance for Callum Chambers ballooned into the air and gave the ball straight to Estonia – and it wasn't the only time.

ITV's England team Adrian Chiles, Glenn Hoddle, Lee Dixon and Ian Wright were the victims of a 'humorous' German on their flight over to Tallinn after changing planes in Frankfurt. A member of the air crew grabbed the in-flight tannoy and said 'We'd like to welcome the English people on board who are going to the match in Estonia. But of course the result won't matter because in 2016 Germany will be champions.' They won't be able to say the same on the return flight with Germany beaten 2-0 in Poland on Saturday night.

At 19, it is hard not to let your feelings show. Raheem Sterling appeared a bit grumpy as he warmed up with the other England substitutes before the game, after losing his starting place to Liverpool team-mate Adam Lallana. 

A lively game of keepball among the subs ended with Sterling complaining and exchanging words with James Milner. The teenager then moved onto shooting practise – blasting the first shot wide and another over the bar after a member of the coaching staff got in his way.

England should probably be grateful that a lax bit of play from Fabian Delph in the opening minute led to a shooting chance for Sergei Zenjov rather than anyone deadly and in-form. The 25-year-old forward was signed by Blackpool manager Jose Riga in the summer but has failed to score so far in nine games for the Championship side.

It's easy to forget how long Wayne Rooney has been around for. In England's last game against Estonia, a 3-0 win at Wembley in 2007, the Manchester United striker scored from Joe Cole's pass. He was the only survivor from that England side on the pitch and he played a captain's role in terms of effort and commitment. Pity his finishing wasn't of quite the same standard.
