Dave Lee Travis arrives at London's Southwark Crown Court today. A female TV personality told the court Travis 'squeezed' her breasts

A female television personality has told a court she 'froze' when veteran DJ Dave Lee Travis 'squeezed' her breasts while she was working on the Mrs Merton Show.

She said the former Radio 1 star approached her in the corridor of a television studio  and his hands on her chest.

The woman told Travis's retrial at Southwark Crown Court in London that the alleged assault in the mid 1990s was 'unbelievably weird' and she thought the former Top Of The Pops presenter, who was booked as a guest on the show, got a 'sexual thrill' from the incident.

The alleged victim, who cannot be named, said: 'I started smoking my cigarette and he came out of his dressing room over to me and said; 'You shouldn't be smoking. Think about your poor little lungs'.

'He started to touch the bottom of my ribcage. Without saying anything else, he slid his hand up to my breasts and then kind of left them there and started squeezing.'

Asked by prosecutor Miranda Moore QC how she felt at the time, the woman replied: 'Shocked. I couldn't believe what was happening. It was just unbelievably weird.

'I had not had any interaction with him. I didn't even know if he knew my name.'

The woman, who was working as part of the production crew in Manchester, described the alleged assault as a 'squeezing grope'.

'I kind of froze,' she said. 'I was standing there just looking up. I didn't know what to say. I was kind of pinned against the wall.'

The woman, who gave evidence without a screen, in view of Travis in the dock, said he let go of her breasts after 10 or 15 seconds.

'I was just kind of looking up at him and thought he's not going to say anything,' she said; 'I put my cigarette out and kind of backed away really.'

She added: 'I had a real adrenaline rush. He was massive. He was looming over me. When I got away....it was like a fight or flight feeling.'

The alleged victim said Travis had an 'intense' stare during the incident, which she reported to a senior producer.

The alleged victim said she was told Travis was known as an 'octopus' because 'his hands go everywhere'

She went on: 'I said; 'Oh my God, Dave Lee Travis just touched my t***'.'

She added: 'It was absolutely the weirdest thing that happened in my life. It was definitely a deliberate attempt. He held on to my breasts for a long time. He was staring.

'I absolutely know he had some weird sexual thrill from this. I felt like I had been punched. It was that feeling of being violated.'

The woman, who was in her early 20s at the time of the alleged incident, said she did not make an official complaint or contact police at the time because she was young and did not want to make 'a fuss'.

She told the court a colleague later told her that Travis was known as an 'octopus' because 'he's got hands that go everywhere'. The woman said she had since spoken in public about the alleged assault.

Stephen Vullo QC, defending Travis, told the court his client had 'no recollection' of the alleged victim.

Peter Kessler, a producer on the Mrs Merton Show, said the woman appeared 'astonished' when she told him about the incident.

'She said words to the effect of 'You'll never guess what's happened - DLT [Travis's nickname] just grabbed my t***,' he told the court.

'DLT had emerged from his dressing room and seen her smoking and gone up to her and said, words to the effect of 'You shouldn't be smoking, it's very bad for your lungs, here and here', and as if illustrating his words, rubbed his hand on her breasts.'

Mr Kessler told the court he had worked with around 200 celebrity guests during his career as a television producer.

He said: 'I was well used to celebrities misbehaving in various ways. I had personal experience of being at the sharp end of celebrity behaviour.

'This was the only occasion anything of a sexual nature happened to my team.'

Asked by Ms Moore about the woman's reaction to the alleged assault, Mr Kessler replied: 'I would say she was slightly stupefied but in her control of herself. She wasn't in tears. It was almost like the most bizarre thing has just happened.'

Mr Kessler said he and the alleged victim decided not to take the matter any further.

'He (Travis) was going to be gone in the next couple of hours, we would never see him again,' he said.

'There were plenty of other things to worry about, put it down to experience. It's a bit of a weird case, let's move on to the next problem.'

Mr Kessler said he contacted police about the incident without the alleged victim's knowledge after seeing a press report in 2012 about an unnamed Radio 1 DJ who had groped a female presenter.

He told the court he had a phone conversation later with the alleged victim and they were 'surprised' that their recollections of the incident were 'exactly the same'.

Under cross-examination, Mr Kessler said he believed the incident was a sexual assault.

He said: 'I can only go by her demeanour and it looked to me like it had been sleazy bad behaviour which might in some cases have been scarring and in other cases, unwelcomed. In her case it looked like she was coping pretty well.'

Mr Kessler told the court he reported Travis's alleged assault after he was prompted by his wife, a barrister, who worked on a BBC review in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Another woman told the court Travis, of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, put his hand between her legs as she served him drinks at a venue in the Isle Of Man in the 1980s.

She said she came forward to police last year in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal and after seeing footage of Travis's 'smug grin' walking into court.

In a police interview played to the court, she said she was left 'dumbfounded' when Travis pinned her against the wall ahead of a celebrity appearance, but when she told a security guard and later her husband, both said he was 'just messing about'.

The woman, who is not one of the complainants in the case, told police: 'He just pinned me against the wall, one hand out, one hand between my legs.'

She added: 'I was so taken aback. I was like, "Don't touch me!" He was very cocky and very sure of himself.'

The woman said she told her cousin about the alleged incident years later.

'She said, "Are you mad? Think of those other victims. Think of Jimmy Savile",' the woman told the court; 'There was his smug grin going into court. I had to do something.'

Giving in evidence from behind a screen, the woman said: 'In them days it was acceptable for men to touch women. It wasn't acceptable behaviour to me at all.'

Travis, 69, who is charged under his real name of David Griffin, denies two counts of indecent assault and one count of sexual assault.

He is facing a retrial on two counts - one of indecent assault of a woman between November 1 1990 and January 31 1991, and another of sexual assault on a different woman between June 1 2008 and November 30 2008 - on which a jury was unable to reach verdicts at a trial earlier this year.

He has also pleaded not guilty to an additional count of indecent assault alleged to have taken place on January 17 1995.

The trial continues.
