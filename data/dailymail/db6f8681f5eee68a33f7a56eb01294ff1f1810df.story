The man accused of butchering his cousin's wife and four children on Saturday night was a family outcast who spent his unemployed days gambling and smoking marijuana, a friend of the suspect has revealed.

According to Tony Chen, 37, who has known Mingdong Chen for several years, the 25-year-old was often agitated and when he played the electronic gambling machines at illegal parlors he'd pound his hand against it angrily if he lost.

His wayward behavior had caused something of a rift between the young man and his family who disproved of his tendency to 'gamble and smoke marijuana,' Tony Chen said.

In court: Mingdong Chen, 25, is arraigned in Brooklyn criminal court on Monday after allegedly butchering his cousin's wife and her four children, aged one to nine, in Brooklyn on Saturday night

Quiet: Chen, whose lawyer said suffered two bruises to his forehead with in police custody, stayed silent

Tony Chen last saw his friend on 
Friday afternoon when they ran into each other on 57th Street and 
chatted, the man told The New York Times.

'He seemed agitated,' he said. 'In recent days, he didn't have so much money.' 

The
new details about the alleged killer's character comes as it's revealed
his first words when he opened the door to his cousin's sister and her 
husband after the attack were, 'I know I am done.'

Chen,
who has flitted between Chicago and New York since arriving in the U.S.
in 2004, was arraigned on Monday for the grim killings.

He
said nothing as he was charged with five counts of murder for the 
deaths of the four children — Linda Zhuo, 9; Amy Zhuo, 7; Kevin Zhuo, 5;
and William Zhuo, 1 — and their mother, Qiao Zhen Li, 37, who died from
cuts to the neck.

He 
was also charged with assaulting a police officer while being questioned
at a precinct after the grisly killings on Saturday evening.

In custody: Chen, who did not enter a plea, has been held without bail and will appear in court next on Friday

Judge Jane Tully ordered him held without bail.

Meanwhile on Monday,
Public School 105, where three of the Zhou children had been students, 
mourned the weekend's shocking events that took place only blocks away.

'It
is with great sadness that I must inform you that three of our students
have passed away,' Johanna Castronovo, the school principal, wrote in a
letter to parents on Monday, in English and Chinese, according to The 
Times.

'In school, our
staff members are working already with the children to provide them 
with information and to help them express the pain and sadness they 
might be experiencing.'

A classmate of fourth-grade Linda described her friend as a 'kind and helpful student.'

'She always shares things with other people,' the friend said. 'When I need pencils, she lets me use her pencils.'

Wearing over-sized blue sweats with his hair disheveled, Chen was quiet in the Brooklyn Criminal Court Monday as he heard the charges against him without entering a plea.

Victims: Chen is accused of murdering 1-year-old William Zhuo, 7-year-old Amy Zhuo, 9-year-old Linda Zhuo, 5-year-old Kevin Zhuo and their mother Qiao Zhen Li. Two of the children are pictured

Distraught father: The father of the family arrived too late to help his wife and children

His
attorney, Danielle Eaddy, said her client had been injured while in 
police custody and appeared to have two bruises on his forehead. She did
not immediately request a psychiatric hearing.

Chen's
next court date was set for Friday, where a grand jury is expected to 
determine whether to indict him in the gruesome deaths.

Police
said Chen stabbed and slashed the victims in their necks and torsos. 
The one-year-old boy was so badly butchered that he was decapitated, 
according to reports.

The 
family was found in various rooms in their apartment on the first floor 
of a two-story brick house. Some were hospitalized and pronounced dead; 
others died at the scene.

'It's a scene you'll never forget,' said Chief of Department Philip Banks III.

The children's father and Chen's 
cousin, Yi Lin Zhuo, was working 
at a Long Island restaurant when the grisly murders unfolded in his home. 

The
mother tried to call him because she was alarmed about Chen's behavior 
earlier in the evening, police said - but she was unable to get through 
to him.

She
then called her mother-in-law in 
China who reached out to her daughter in the same Brooklyn neighborhood 
of Sunset Park, asking her and her husband to drop by the 
house.

When they went to check, they allegedly found Chen with a knife and dripping in blood amid the carnage.

The children's father learned the horrifying news though a police interpreter of Chinese.

'The father was freaking out,' May Chan, a neighbor, told the New York Daily News. 'He just came home from work and saw the police and they told him. He was hysterical.

Mingdong Chen said, according to police, after he was found among the bodies dripping with blood

'I
always see (the kids) running around here,' he added. 
'They run around by my garage playing. They run up and down screaming. 
They're little kids ... that's so heartbreaking. Innocent kids, my God.'

Chen had been staying with the family for about a week. He was a transient and illegally in the United States, Assistant District Attorney Mark Hale said. An immigration hold was also placed on him.

Police said Chen apparently was envious of fellow immigrants' successes in America.

'He made a very soft comment that 
since he came to this country, everybody seems to be doing better than 
him,' Banks said Sunday.

Chen was unemployed after being fired from a string of restaurant jobs he held for just a few weeks at a time, according to neighbors and relatives in the working-class Brooklyn neighborhood.

Neighbors also said that days before the brutal killings, loud, late-night arguments could be heard from the street.

Chen remained 
'bizarrely calm' as he was dragged past his family's corpses and during 
his confession to police in which he said he was jealous of his victims'
money.

He was taken barefoot, his feet caked in blood, from the home in handcuffs by police.

'The family had too much. Their income (and) lifestyle was better than his,' a source told the New York Post.

The
family did not appear to be better-off than those who lived around them
in the working-class Chinese neighborhood near Ninth Avenue in 
Brooklyn.

They sent their three school-age children to a local public 
school, according to the Education Department and Li stayed at home with
William.
