We all know we should be eating the recommended ‘five a day’ of fruit and veg. Now there’s a host of exotic superfruits that are said to help reverse the skin’s ageing process, boost energy levels and even fight disease.

MANGOSTEEN

Native to South-East Asia, mangosteen is also known as the ‘queen of fruit’, because Queen Victoria offered a reward to anyone who could deliver some to her palace. Perhaps she’d heard about its amazing health benefits, which range from healthy joints to improving the immune system.

‘Mangosteen has been touted for its high content of xanthone compounds, which studies have shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties,’ says Naomi Mead, lead nutritionist and founder of nutrition clinic Food First.

Mangosteen is also good for acne, PMS and younger-looking skin.

Buy your mangosteen in liquid form from Holland & Barrett (£2.45) or Planet Organic (£2.75), or order a bottle of capsules from biovea.com (£17.20).

PITAYA

More commonly known as dragon fruit, this is mild- tasting, but packs a powerful nutritional punch.

‘Pitaya is rich in vitamin C, which has been repeatedly proven to protect against auto-immune diseases, heart problems and even the signs of ageing skin. It contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which help reduce inflammation and improve cell function,’ says Mead.

Ocado stocks it in fresh (£2.99) and tea (£2.99) form.

GAC

The spiky outer layer of this vine fruit might be poisonous, but the edible arils, or extra seeds, hidden inside are used across South-East Asia because of their fantastic red colour.

The fruit contains huge amounts of beta-carotene and lycopene, known for their medicinal properties. ‘Research has found the concentration of lycopene in gac to be around ten times higher than in tomatoes and carrots,’ says Mead.

‘Several studies, including research from the School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences at Portsmouth University, suggest lycopene helps protect against cancer of the lung, stomach and prostate.’

Order gac, in powder form, for the princely sum of £66.57 from Amazon. No one said every superfood comes cheap.

SAW PALMETTO

The berries of this plant have been used in American Indian herbal medicine for hundreds of years — and for good reason. The fruit contains antioxidant compounds that can help in the treatment of an enlarged prostate gland or benign prostate hyperplasia.

‘Clinical research has shown that taking one 320mg capsule of saw palmetto daily for two months before prostate surgery reduces blood loss, the development of problems during surgery and the total time spent in the hospital,’ says Mead.

Capsules available from Holland & Barrett (£12.25) or Amazon (£7.99).

LUCUMA

‘Not only is it a good source of antioxidants, fibre, beta- carotene, niacin, potassium, zinc and iron, but the caramel taste makes it a healthy sugar alternative for diabetics and those avoiding refined sugar,’ says Mead.

Pick up this yellow Peruvian fruit at Planet Organic (£6.99) or Whole Foods Market (£7.42).

PICHUBERRY

Another Peruvian export, this small berry  looks similar to a kumquat, but has a much higher vitamin content. Not only does it boast excellent levels of vitamin D, vital for healthy bones and skin, but it also contains vitamins C and B12. ‘It has been shown to reduce inflammation as well as possessing anti-cancer properties,’ says Mead.

Also known as Inca berries, green-fingered experts say they’re hardy enough to be grown in Britain.

Find them at biovea.net/uk (£13.05) or suttons.co.uk (£2.49 for seeds).

ARONIA

All hail this North American berry, which has one of the highest antioxidant values recorded for a fruit.

The deep purple berries, often called chokeberries due to their tart taste, are packed full of natural compounds that help protect cells from free radicals that cause ageing, degenerative diseases and cancer.

Buy from Ocado (£4.55 for juice), biovea.com (£12 for capsules) or Whole Foods Market (£18.29 for 1kg of berries).

MONK

‘In its purest form, this Chinese fruit is 300 times sweeter than table sugar, but is all natural and has a low glycaemic index, which means it is absorbed very slowly, making it suitable for diabetics and hypoglycemic individuals,’ says Mead.

Fans of monk call it the ‘longevity fruit’ as they believe it increases life expectancy. Studies suggest it helps to support the immune system, digestive tract and acts as a natural antihistamine.

You can order it from Amazon for £11.99.
