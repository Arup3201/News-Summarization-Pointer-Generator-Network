A women admitted to a Chicago hospital following an alcohol binge claims a doctor took photos of her without her consent and then posted them on Facebook.

Elena Chernyakova, 23, who is claiming invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress, has filed a $1.5 million lawsuit against Dr. Vinaya Puppala, who she already knew through a mutual friend, the Feinberg School of Medicine and the Northwestern Memorial Hospital.

The incident took place on 13 June after Chernyakova was taken to the emergency room at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, at 3am suffering for overconsumption of alcohol.

She was allegedly unconscious for the next eight hours and wasn't released until 5.30pm that day.

About 15 minutes after she regained consciousness, Puppala, who was on duty at the time and knew Chernyakova through a mutual friend, visited her hospital room, according to the complaint.

He allegedly asked to view her medical records, and then returned several hours later to take photographs of her ‘while she was on the hospital bed, crying and attached to an IV,’ according to the complaint.

Puppala was seen by hospital security in the hospital taking the pictures and was asked to delete them immediately, which he refused to do.

Former Northwestern University student Elena Chernyakova is an aspiring model/actress, although her lawsuit claims she has the 'potential to someday work for Fortune 500 companies, which may now not occur because of said photographs'

Instead he posted the photographs on Facebook and Instagram, along with ‘attached statements of commentary’ about her condition, according to the complaint.

The complaint alleges that Chernyakova never agreed to be photographed, and was not even in a condition to provide her consent.

The hospital and Feinberg Medical School ‘substantially assisted’ Puppala in allowing this to happen, according to the complaint. 

According to her website, Chernyakova is an actress, model, and ex-professional tennis player from Moscow, Russia. 

She started acting in July 2012 after 
graduating from Northwestern University with a degree in Communication 
Studies, Business, and International Studies. She has appeared in 
several films and TV shows, including Superhero Me, Psychotic and 
Chicagolicious.

According to her complaint, she has the ‘potential to someday work for Fortune 500 companies, which may now not occur because of said photographs.’

The Northwestern Memorial Hospital is investigating the allegations and has said it will cooperate with authorities, but emphasized that Puppala was acting ‘entirely on his own.’

‘Any invasion of privacy at the hands of our trusted health personnel or extended care team of training fellows is unacceptable and not indicative of the Patients' First culture of Northwestern Memorial Hospital, which has zero tolerance for exploitation of private health information, including photography,’ the hospital said in a statement to ABCNews.

Puppala is a fellow in the Multidisciplinary Pain Medicine Fellowship at Feinberg, Michigan, which works in conjunction with Northwestern Memorial Hospital, according to court documents.
