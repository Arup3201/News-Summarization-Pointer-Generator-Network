A bewildered tenant has been hit with
a £41,000 bill after his water pipes burst - just days after being 
charged £33,000 for the same leak.

Ryan Bishop, 29, was horrified when 
South East Water sent him the five-figure bill after a 21.5 million 
litre water leak outside his rented property in Peacehaven, East Sussex.

A burst pipe had meant that enough water to fill more than 60 swimming pools seeped into greenland adjacent to his home.

Shocked: Ryan Bishop, 29, with the £33,000 water bill he received after a pipe leak at his rented home in Peacehaven, East Sussex, pumped out 21.5 million litres of water

He knew nothing about the leak until a routine meter check revealed his water consumption was 50 times higher than normal.

Mr Bishop refused to sort out the repairs because he is a tenant, and he claims he contacted  Bovis Homes, the developers of the new-build, along with his landlord in June 2012 to report the leaks.

But it was never fixed and on January
15 South East Water arrived to sort out the problem - and charged the 
tenant with the costs.

Despite previously warning his landlord and house developer about the leak, he was ordered to pay  £33,000 by South East Water, who have since cancelled the five-figure bill.

The company will instead 
charge the 29-year-old an estimate based on his normal water usage.

But now Southern Water - who base its sewage bills on how much water households have used - has asked Ryan for a further £41,458.83.

Repairs: South South East Water said it had to take action to stop water being wasted

He said: 'That's nearly £75,000 of bills in a week. I'm just finding it funny now because there's no way that I can pay it.'

A Southern Water spokeswoman added: 
'South East Water will send us the new figures so we can recalculate our
waste bill accordingly.

'We understand Mr Bishop's alarm over this bill and will be contacting him to offer a full explanation.'

Speaking after being slapped with the
first bill, the scaffolder said: 'It was a bit of a shock. I phoned the
water company up and they said it wasn't a mistake.

'There was a leak outside the property and it's down to me or the landlord to pay.

'When I told them about it six months
ago Bovis Homes said it was not their responsibility, even though they 
built the home and it has a two year guarantee.

'I got in touch with Premier Lets and
Sales who I rent with and told them the landlord needed to sort it. I 
just assumed everything was all ok.'

He added: 'The water company said 
they'd help and let me pay in instalments. But I've told them I don't 
have the money and there's no chance of me paying.'

A Bovis Homes spokesman said the issue was being fully investigated, adding: 'There appears to have
been a lack of effective communication on all sides over this issue.

'This has obviously developed into a 
very unfortunate situation and if we had been properly informed at a 
much earlier stage we could have worked with everyone involved to ensure
corrective action was taken and this whole situation avoided.'

Bovis Homes said they could find 'no written record of any party contacting us via phone, email or post'.

South East Water said it was 
continuing its investigations into the wasted water and was taking up 
the matter with the developer, Bovis Homes.

A spokeswoman for the water company said: 'South East Water will not be taking legal action in this case.

'Our priority, as it always is with leaks, was to carry out the repairs to stop the water running to waste.

'We will be contacting the bill payer, who in this case is a tenant of the property, and will be looking to make an adjustment to the bill in respect of any leakage.

'We will send them a new bill based on an estimate of what their normal water usage would be.

'With regards to payment of the wasted water, our investigations are on-going and we will be contacting the developer of the property in relation to this.'
