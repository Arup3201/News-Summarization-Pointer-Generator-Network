Fears over Britain's porous borders are growing as it is revealed that thousands of illegal immigrants are at large despite failing immigration checks

Figures show that there has been a dramatic increase in the proportion who vanish after failing checks once inside the country.

Less than one in four are subsequently caught - meaning they have avoided detection while still inside the country.

Less than one in four illegal immigrants are caught by UK immigration staff after failing immigration checks once they have made their way into the country 

Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee said the figures are a 'real concern' considering the worsening 'security situation' at UK borders.  

The statistic obtained by The Sunday Telegraph showed that 3,527 immigrants absconded after failing immigration checks last year. 

Only 846 were found, meaning 76 per cent - around 2,700 - remained at large in the UK. 

Although the number who were still at large following failed checks has fallen from 9,362 in 2010 to 3,527 last year, the record for catching them has worsened.

In 2010, 58 per cent were subsequently caught, but by last year this figure had fallen to around a quarter (24 per cent). 

The worrying statistics come after it was revealed that one in five travellers is not counted in and out of Britain against criminal and terror checks because of IT failures and management blunders. 

Catastrophic IT failures and management blunders mean 20million passengers escape full screening every year. 

Six million people arriving by train – which includes Eurostar – do not undergo advance checks.

Only 20 per cent of sea journeys are logged – the equivalent of ten million passengers slipping through the net without having their details compared against lists of killers and dangerous fanatics. 

A Home Office spokesman said: 'We take all breaches seriously and are determined to tackle immigration abuse.

'Most of these breaches occur when individuals fail to keep reporting appointments. Nobody has absconded from immigration detention or while under escort in 2013/14.

'We have rigorous security arrangements in place and if an individual does abscond, we work closely with the police and other agencies to locate them.

'Breaches remain under investigation until the individual has been located or it has been established that they have left the UK voluntarily. 

'This causes a time lag in the figures and closure rates for 2013 and previous years will therefore continue to increase as time goes on.'
