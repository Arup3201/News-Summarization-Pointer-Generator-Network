Sportsmail takes a trip into the Wimbledon 'Locker Room' - the place where you can find out some of the best of action on offer.

Heather Watson's the only Brit to watch on Thursday, while Ana Ivanovic could fall victim to our so far prophetic seed in danger. Plus the weather forecast and ground pass bonus for Thursday at SW19.

There is only one home prospect in action today and Heather Watson faces a tough task second up on Centre Court against Angelique Kerber.

The German was a semi-finalist here in 2012, losing in straight sets to Poland’s Agnieszka Radwanska, and is seeded ninth this year.

No previous to write of as the pair, curiously, have never met before.

This segment holds a 100 per cent record for predicting upsets so far.

Sloane Stephens (No 18), Jelena Jankovic (No 7) and Ernests Gulbis (No 12) have all tumbled after being flagged as seeds in danger.

So apologies in advance to Ana Ivanovic, who faces Jie Zheng on No 3 Court.

The Serbian 11th seed has history with unexpected defeats and Zheng is in good grass-court form.

Sorry: Ana Ivanovic could be next to fall if Sportsmail's prophetic 'seed in danger' proves right again

The third match on Court 12 offers the chance to watch young American talent Madison Keys in action against 31st seed Klara Koukalova.

Keys, 19, won her first WTA title at the Aegon International in Eastbourne this month and could take out the Czech player 13 years her senior.
