A disgraced teacher sobbed in court today as she was jailed for repeatedly having sex with an underage high school football player.

Andrea Conners, 34, was arrested in May after her affair with the male student became public following small-town gossip in Newport, Kentucky.

The married mother-of-two, who had pleaded guilty to sexual abuse, was sentenced to 90 days in prison with five years on probation. She will also be put on the sex offender's register for 20 years.

Jailed: Andrea Conners, 34, was led off to prison today after being sentenced to 90 days for having sex with a male pupil in Fort Thomas, Kentucky

Sobbed: The married mother-of-two wept before Judge Fred Stine as she said how sorry she was for the affair with a high school football player

Mrs Conners stood before Campbell Circuit Judge Fred Stine today and sobbed: 'I would just like to say how sincerely sorry I am.'

Her attorney Rob Dziech said his client was remorseful and that her 'horrible mistake' had ruined her ten-year marriage and damaged her relationship with her two sons.

However prosecutor Michelle Snodgrass told the court that the affair had been ongoing and sexual encounters had taken place in school classrooms, parks and at Conners' parents' home.

Ms Snodgrass also said that the victim had been hospitalized four times for anxiety and stress following the abuse. 

Conners worked at Highland High 
School in Fort Thomas, Kentucky, for eight years. She is married to 
Brian Conners, the principal of a nearby high school. 

The circumstances of the alleged relationship remain unclear, though she resigned from her $48,000-a-year job in the week before she was indicted for felony sexual abuse.

Dirty teacher: Conners began working at the school in 2004 and taught several business and communications courses

The age of consent in Kentucky is 16 but it is a felony for a teacher to have sex with a student under 18.

Mrs Conners began her teaching career as an intern at the school in 2004 and taught several business and communications courses. The school district and authorities have been tight-lipped about the case.

Superintendent Gene Kirchner previously released
 a statement that didn't mention Conners by name, but said a teacher had
 resigned after she was confronted with rumors about the relationship.

'Please
 know that the discretion we have shown in the release of information is
 a direct result of the ongoing investigation and an effort to protect 
the rights and privacy of our students,' a letter to parents said.

Conners' husband of ten years, Brian, is 
the principal at St Bernard-Elmwood Place Junior High School in 
Cincinnati. The couple have two sons.
