Ireland stalwart John O’Shea backed Roy Keane to thrive in the Glasgow goldfish bowl if confirmed as Celtic’s new manager.

The centre-back offered a glowing appraisal of his former Manchester United team-mate as speculation over Keane’s future intensified.

With every indication pointing to him being appointed Parkhead boss early next week, Martin O’Neill expects to learn in the next 72 hours whether he will lose his assistant from the Irish national team set-up.

There is rival interest in Keane – with West Bromwich Albion thought to be in the frame – but sources in Dublin remain confident he will take up the challenge of replacing Neil Lennon.

Keane travelled with the Ireland squad to London on Friday ahead of their friendly against Italy at Craven Cottage. It is expected he will hold further talks with Dermot Desmond, the major shareholder at Parkhead, once that game is out of the way.

Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell stressed that Keane had not yet been offered the job and that the Premiership champions were speaking to ‘between five and 10’ candidates in total.

O’Shea, though, expects the 42-year-old to end up at Parkhead. Having worked with him at both club and international level, he has no doubt Keane’s temperament could handle the intense scrutiny of life in Glasgow as Celtic boss.

‘I think he’d cope very well,’ said O’Shea. ‘His appetite since he’s come into this job will have increased.

‘He’s obviously learned from Martin along the way, too. He’ll relish the challenge. If it does happen, Celtic will be getting a very hungry and determined manager.’

Asked if he thought that would be the outcome, he added: ‘Yeah, it looks very much like it now.

‘It was mentioned at the start of the week and slowly but surely it’s snowballed into having talks with Celtic. So I’d very surprised if it doesn’t get across the line.’

Ireland head to America on Wednesday for further friendlies against Costa Rica and Portugal. O’Neill expects Keane’s situation to be clarified before they cross the Atlantic.

‘I imagine that in the next few days the situation will resolve itself,’ he said. ‘Whether it goes into Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday, we are not actually leaving until Wednesday.

‘So I would imagine that the situation would be sorted by then. Celtic are actively seeking a manager and they have a certain number of days to try and do something because they will want a man in place for when they come back for pre-season.’

O’Neill also insisted Keane was in wider demand, adding: ‘As I have said before, I would have expected him to step into management eventually because I think that was something that was still burning within him.

‘But I did not think it would happen so quickly, that he would have offers - a number of offers – on the table. And I am not talking about Celtic, I am talking about other teams.’

Lawwell confirmed Keane was a leading contender but insisted other options still remained under consideration.

‘Roy has played here and is a Celtic supporter,’ said the Parkhead chief executive. ‘He is a first-class guy, like the others are. We have between five and 10, a lot of great candidates, and we’ll wait and see.’

Asked if Keane had been offered the job, Lawwell said: ‘No, he’s not. We put a statement out saying we are looking at a number of exceptional candidates.

‘We are going through a process. Hopefully, it won’t take too long but I’m sure you’ll understand there is not much more we can say when we’re midway through that process.

‘Clearly we want to do it as soon as we possibly can but you can’t put a time on these things.

‘You just have to do your work properly. As soon as we get there we will let our supporters know. You don’t want to get it wrong by going too fast. You need to take your time and make sure you get the right guy.'
