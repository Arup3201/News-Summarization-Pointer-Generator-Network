Tristram Hunt, Labour education spokesman

Labour was accused of hypocrisy last night after attempting to redefine itself as the party of the family.

Tristram Hunt, the party’s education spokesman, said Labour needed to lose its ‘fear of the “F” word’ and talk more about the importance of ‘bonds and relationships’.

Rather than allowing the Tories to dominate the subject, he said Labour had to ‘shed its leftist qualms’ about appearing patronising when tackling dysfunctional families.

Mr Hunt criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s governments for not doing enough through the tax and benefit system to help families stay together.

Tory backbenchers said no one would believe Labour’s volte-face because many of its welfare policies while in power had made the position of married couples worse. They poured scorn on Mr Hunt’s intervention, pointing out that his party still opposes the Tories’ marriage tax break.

In an interview with The Independent, Mr Hunt said Labour needed to change its tune on the family if it wanted to tackle the problem of social immobility.

He confirmed that Labour would keep David Cameron’s Troubled Families Programme, which intervenes in families with problems such as anti-social behaviour, worklessness and truancy.

The former TV historian admitted that previous Labour administrations had relied too much on transferring money to disadvantaged households through tax credits, and suggested it had shied away from talking about the importance of stable relationships because of qualms about dictating family structures.

Mr Hunt said: ‘We’re talking to Labour colleagues about shedding any vestige of fear about talking about the importance and significance of the family, and how important stable relationships and stable parenting environments are for children’s attainment.

‘We shouldn’t let the Right and the Conservatives have that. There has been a fear of the “F” word and I think the balance is to say that families do take different forms and it’s really, really important that we focus on quality of relationships and what breakdown means as barriers for children succeeding.

‘It is important from the position of shadow secretary of state to stress just how significant nurture, attachment, parenting and support for the family as a vital component of social mobility and educational attainment is going to be for the next Labour government and shedding any leftist qualms about how significant and valuable the family is.’

Mr Hunt said Labour had to ‘reflect upon’ academic evidence which shows that supporting families is not just a matter of giving them benefits.

‘Too much of the Labour project was closely associated just with fiscal transfers rather than stressing the importance of bonds and attachments and relationships and the broader cultural importance and value,’ he said.

‘This wasn’t often stressed as much as it could have been.’ He added: ‘These families are troubled, and it’s multiple levels of trouble, and it would not be solved by more tax credits. We don’t have the money for that and we know the limitations of that project.’

Peter Bone, Tory MP for Wellingborough, said: ‘Words are cheap, but it’s action that counts. If you look at their record during 13 years in power, you see that they did nothing to bring families together.

‘These words are just Labour propaganda with six months to go till the election.

‘People will think it’s ludicrous. No one is going to believe Labour on this. They’re opposed to the marriage tax allowance, and they did nothing but sign cheques for disadvantaged families when they were in charge.

‘Hypocrisy and Labour seem to go hand in hand.’

A source at the Department for Education said: ‘Families will not be lectured by Tristram Hunt. The last Labour government ruined the economy, adding pressure on families up and down the country. Families know that is what they will do again if they get a chance.’
