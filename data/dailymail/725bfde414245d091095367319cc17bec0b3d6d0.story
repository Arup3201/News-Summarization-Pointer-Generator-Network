After a marathon campaign the former principal oboist from the Welsh National Opera has proved he was unfairly sacked.

Now judges at the Court of Appeal have urged the warring woodwind section of the company to return to harmony after they ruled that Murray 'Sandy' Johnston was unfairly dismissed.

Talented Mr Johnston, 63, was sacked after 34 years in the ranks of the WNO on grounds that the sound of his instrument did not 'blend' with the rest of the orchestra.

He was made to go through auditions to prove that his instrument was acceptable to the orchestra.

But the musician claimed his career with WNO began to wane following a personality clash with former musical director, Carlo Rizzi.

After long-term 'difficulties' in the 
relationship between the oboeist and Mr Rizzi, Mr Johnston had satisfied
assessors, including the then music director, that his 'intonation' and
'emission of sound' came up to scratch during auditions.

Murray Johnston has finally proved he was unfairly dismissed

However, he continued to face 
criticism of his perceived shortcomings in 'ensemble' situations and the
'blending of sound' between his instrument and the orchestra.

His dismissal came after the WNO said 
that aspect of his playing could not be tested by audition with a 
pianist to accompany him but only in 'full ensemble conditions'.

Although the WNO purported to follow 
the disciplinary procedure laid down in its handbook, it did not comply 
with the operaâ€™s agreement with the Musicians Union, which was designed 
to protect musicians from 'too subjective an assessment' of their 
artistic performance.

The judge, sitting with Lords Justice 
Moore-Bick and Sullivan, said it was 'inevitable' that it would be found
that the disciplinary procedure to which Mr Johnston was subjected for 
his perceived artistic failings was 'procedurally unfair'.

Lord Justice Kay said: 'To subject Mr 
Johnston to the handbook disciplinary procedure, minus the requirements 
of oral, written and final warnings, was procedurally unfair, even if 
the concern was to save him from additional stress.'

After today's decision the case will now return to an employment tribunal for the amount of compensation payable by the WNO to Mr Johnston to be assessed.

However, after pointing to the massive cost of three previous contested hearing, Lord Justice Maurice Kay said: 'I hope that the parties will give active consideration to the possibility of a negotiated settlement, if necessary through mediation'.

After ruling that the disciplinary procedure followed lacked the element of objectivity that would have made it fair, the judge concluded: 'It was not a reasonable response to the problem that had arisen... I consider that a finding of procedural unfairness is inevitable'.
