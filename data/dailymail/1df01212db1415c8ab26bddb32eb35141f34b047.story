They don't look very exciting.

In fact big grey granny knickers are considered by most to be the ultimate turn-off.

But these frumpy looking pants by high-end intimates brand Kiki de Montparnasse are actually the first word in luxury.

Don't fancy yours much: grey granny pants fail to impress

At £238 and dry clean only, the Heather Frey boy shorts are designed for a very discerning customer.

They are described as luxe and flattering, which is good to know if you are spending a couple of hundred pounds on your underwear.

Made in Italy the 100% cashmere knickers are part of a full range that includes briefs (a snip at £207), seamed socks, leggings, a bralette, a chemise and a boyfriend jumper.

The practical, cosy range is a far cry from the overtly sexy burlesque themed lingerie the brand is famous for.

French lace, raw silk, ribbons and satin
 feature heavily in collections with exotic names like Voyeur and 
Ingenue and more daring customers can stock up on bedroom accessories 
from the brand’s Instruments of Pleasure range.

And recently fashion muse Julia 
Restoin-Roitfeld, daughter of fierce French Vogue editor Caroline, was 
commissioned to designed a capsule collection for the brand inspired by 
Parisian pin-ups.

Celebrities sightings in their intimate salon stores at New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas  have made Kiki's designs a must-have for well heeled lingerie lovers willing to spend big to impress.

Rihanna, Gaga, Lindsay Lohan and the Kardashians are all fans of the provocative label.

No sightings though of any of them stockpiling the cashmere granny pants.
