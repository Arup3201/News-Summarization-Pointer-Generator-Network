Bayern Munich visited the Pope after their 7-1 demolition of Roma on Tuesday night. Afterwards, mind you, not beforehand. Bayern needed no divine intervention. They just needed to do what they do when they hit their best form: swarm irrepressibly over the opposition.

Except swarm doesn't really do it justice. Better the phrase used by German magazine 'kicker', which described Bayern, and Pep Guardiola's plan, as 'more precise than a world famous surgeon'.

Precision. That was what marked this Bayern performance out as so special. It wasn't that Roma defended particularly poorly – they even had a few strong chances on goal themselves – it was that Bayern's attacks were so precise. The Italians simply could not plug the eye of every single needle.

This, as Guardiola has now successfully convinced the world, is not tiki-taka. Yet this is absolutely Guardiola's Bayern. Three at the back playing a high line, with a total of three players on each wing, all overlapping perpetually. A rock solid distributor in Xabi Alonso, and a couple of effortless space creators in the centre of attack in Thomas Muller and Robert Lewandowski.

The result is that Bayern can perpetually switch the play, without being caught on the counter attack. It means they can perpetually push forward, without forcing their opposition merely to park the bus. It is an immensely precise, but also an immensely flexible system. Guardiola has demanded from day one that his players are able and willing to fill at least two different roles across a season. Last night, many of them did so in the space of half an hour.

Arjen Robben was full of praise for his coach, saying 'huge praise goes to the training staff, who set us up perfectly'. As Guardiola put it after the game, though, 'good tactics are useless without good players'.

At the moment, Bayern finally seem to be harmonising the incredible quality of their squad with the innovative brilliance of their manager. Last season, it often appeared that they were trying too much to fit themselves to Guardiola's system. In their current form, they don't need to – it just comes naturally.

For the fans, this is seventh heaven. Guardiola remains a little too exotic to become a local cult hero like Jurgen Klopp at Borussia Dortmund or Ottmar Hitzfeld at Bayern, but there are no complaints anymore about his adaptation of Bayern. For this team, winning is not enough – they have to dominate and destroy. That is exactly what they are doing, having scored seventeen goals in their last three games.

There is a chant among Bayern fans which simply goes: 'Super Bayern, Super Bayern, hey!'. The team which took apart Roma on Tuesday night did look superhuman. Their strength, their flowing football, their precision were all simply out of this world.
