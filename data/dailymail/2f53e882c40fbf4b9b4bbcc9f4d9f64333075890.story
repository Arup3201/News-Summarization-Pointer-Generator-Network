Danny Cavill 'could have been saved' if staff had not declined the call for help

A police helicopter which could have saved a young man's life was not sent up because staff were due to go off duty, an inquest heard.

Officers, family and friends were desperately searching on the ground for 21-year-old Danny Cavill who had threatened to harm himself after a night out.

Mr Cavill was still alive when a request was put in to South Yorkshire Police for a helicopter to help find him but night-time air support staff declined as their shift was due to end 20 minutes later.

An official investigation discovered that because 'a life was at risk' the shift should have been extended by an hour and Danny, who hanged himself, could have been saved.

Acting Chief Inspector David Butler 
who carried out an investigation into the police response told a 
Rotherham inquest: 'We will never know if the helicopter would have 
found Danny that morning, in my view it should have been given the 
opportunity.'

A police 
sergeant has been reprimanded and air support staff given further 
training following the tragedy at Sitwell Park Golf Club, near Whiston, 
Rotherham where the 21-year-old was an assistant greenkeeper.

Chief Insp Butler outlined a series of
mistakes by the force and said another helicopter could have been 
called in from neighbouring forces but the call was never made.

He
said the incident should have been classed as an 'immediate priority' 
and the police call centre handler did not elicit enough information 
about Danny’s plight.

An
expert search officer was not contacted and cell-site analysis was not 
deployed which could have pinpointed Danny’s position within 200 metres 
and narrowed down the search parameters.

Mr Butler also said the police sergeant in charge of the search was working on a 'flawed assessment' passed to him second-hand from the family.

The Rotherham hearing was told Danny, who was drunk, was ejected from the Liquid nightclub in Rotherham town centre about 2am on Saturday, May 7 last year.

He phoned his best friend Josh Hill, 21, in a distressed manner and told him: 'Nobody likes me, I can’t get in contact with anyone. I’m going to do something stupid and I’m walking by the rail track now.'

After Mr Hill raised the alarm police were called in and searchers initially went to a railway bridge where Danny had previously been found when drunk before the search switched to the golf club.

Sgt Kevin Bradley, who was later reprimanded, said the family did not believe Danny would carry out the threat to harm himself and he only rated the incident as 'medium risk' so did not call out the consortium helicopter after the South Yorkshire chopper failed to get airborne.

'With the resources we had on the ground we did the best search possible of the golf course,' he told the hearing. 'I would have had to justify the other helicopter when we’re not sure he was going to carry out the threat.'

Danny, who lived with his parents in Brinsworth, Rotherham was on a Friday night with friends in an 'upbeat' mood and looking forward to a holiday he had booked in Ibiza.

He made a series of unanswered calls and texts to his girlfriend Simone Fox before attempts to contact him by phone failed.

Mr Hill said: 'I never thought he would do something like this. He was the life and soul of the party. He was always the centre of attention and everyone loved him.'

Miss Fox, 21, who had been drinking in the club with her girlfriends said she could not remember rowing with Danny. She managed to speak to him briefly by mobile when he went missing and found out he was at the golf course.

She said: 'I thought it was a cry for attention. He knew we were looking for him and thought we would find him in time. He was drunk and I don’t really think he thought about what he was doing.'

Danny’s father Stephen said: 'He liked going out on Friday nights with his mates. He used to like a drink and fell asleep in different places. That is what we thought had happened that night.'

Delivering her verdict, Rotherham coroner Nicola Mundy criticised South Yorkshire Police’s response.

She said: 'There were in my view shortcomings in the response. The quality of communication was disappointing in the extreme and fairly basic questions could have been asked which would have affected the prioritisation of the response.

'The question of the helicopter was not properly pursued when it should have been. It was available to be deployed had the proper questions been posed.'

Ms Mundy went on: 'On balance I can say it is a possibility it would have altered the outcome. There were missed opportunities which could have affected the outcome.'

She said Danny’s ejection from the nightclub affected him more profoundly than other people 'particularly when his attempts to contact friends and those close to him failed.'

He was upset and had a 'disproportionate' reaction to what happened which was exacerbated by alcohol. 'After that things very quickly got out of control,' she said.

The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death.
