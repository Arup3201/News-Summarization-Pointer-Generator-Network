A farmer admitted yesterday that he shot dead a cocker spaniel belonging to actress Sue Johnston.

Gordon Glover said he shot the one-year-old dog after it attacked livestock, killing his grandson’s pet chicken.

He had initially denied seeing the dog. Miss Johnston, 70, is said to be heartbroken after learning of the death of her pet, named Bo.

A farmer has insisted he only shot dead Coronation Street star Sue Johnston's dog because it killed his chickens. Gordon Glove, 69, said he killed one-year-old Bo, and another cocker spaniel, after the pair ran 'wild' into his yard in Marton, near Macclesfield and killed his chickens

The Coronation Street and Royle Family
 star had appealed for Bo’s return when she went missing last week. The 
actress, who also appeared in Brookside, had been searching frantically 
for Bo, who ran off with another dog while being walked by a 
professional dog walker.

The
 dog walker, who gave her name only as Kim, asked local farmers – 
including 69-year-old Mr Glover – if they had seen the dogs but they all
 said no. Yesterday Mr Glover said he felt awful after killing Bo and 
the other dog, a cocker spaniel called Hattie, with his shotgun.

He said the dogs were running wild and had attacked his hens, killing one in front of his grandsons.

‘I
 tried to drive them away but couldn’t and in the end I got my gun,’ he 
said. ‘My grandsons are only five and two and they were in floods of 
tears. I didn’t know what else to do. I don’t understand why the dogs 
weren’t kept on a lead.’

Mr 
Glover said he buried both dogs on his farm near Marton, Cheshire. Bo 
and Hattie were among several dogs with the dog walker on Tuesday last 
week. She said they chased after a rabbit.

‘Even
 though I shouted they didn’t come back. I was looking for them for 
days,’ she added. ‘On Friday I went round all the farms with 
photographs. I even went to see the farmer who shot them – but he denied
 having seen them.

‘Sue’s my friend. It’s dreadful for her and nobody could feel worse than I do. I’ve also lost Hattie, who was my baby.’

Cheshire
 Police contacted Mr Glover but said he was legally entitled to shoot 
the dogs. The farmer said he was too embarrassed to admit that he had 
killed them when approached by the dog walker.

Miss
 Johnston, who is best known for playing Barbara Royle in The Royle 
Family and who has just left Coronation Street, was not available for 
comment yesterday.

She is 
said to be ‘devastated’ by Bo’s death. A family friend said: ‘Sue is 
understandably very distressed about the loss of her family pet. She’d 
like to thank everyone who helped her scour the area.’
