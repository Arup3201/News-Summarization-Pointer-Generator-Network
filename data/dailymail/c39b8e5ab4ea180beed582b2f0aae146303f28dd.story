Tiffany Cole and Emilia Carr did not know each other before they were put on death row at Florida's Lowell Correctional Institution in Ocala.

But now the women, who share incredibly similar stories, couldn't imagine life without each other.

Sexually abused when they were young, the cellmates were both convicted of separate murder charges they say are wrong and are fighting to have their death penalties removed from their sentences.

Carr, 30, is the is the youngest woman in the United States on death row, while Cole, 33, is the third youngest.

'It's legal murder,' Cole told ABC News' 20/20 program during an interview with Diane Sawyer, which will air in-full on Friday.

'We call it life row': The women spend up to 24 hours a day locked in their cell 

Defiant: Cole and Carr refused to believe they are going to be executed

Young: Emilia Carr, 30, is the youngest woman in the United States sitting on death row

'How many rich people go to prison?' Carr added.

'We're all minorities.

'We're all people who are either minorities or didn't have any, money - any way to say, ''Hey, let me buy my freedom'', because it's not free in this country.

'Unfortunately, equality is an illusion.'

Cole was 26 when she was found guilty of the kidnapping and first-degree murder of a Florida  husband and wife.

Cole had lived next to them for years in South Carolina before moving to Jackonsville.

Cole and three men robbed the couple before tying them up, driving them across the border to Georgia and burying them alive.

The jury was shown photos of Cole and two co-defendants in a limousine, celebrating with champagne and handfuls of cash after the crime.

The jury voted 9 to 3 that she should receive the death penalty.

Cole claims she helped dig the grave but that she did not know it was for the victims.

She claims she thought the group were going to bury some of the items they had stolen.

'I am not the same person anymore,' Cole said. 

'I have peace, I have joy. I have a sound mind.'

Emilia  Carr was sentenced to death by lethal injection in 2011 for the 2009 murder of Heather Strong.

Strong was the wife of Carr's boyfriend, and both were convicted of her suffocating her with a plastic bag and dumping the body in a Florida storage unit.

Carr was eight months pregnant at the time and now has four children, but is not allowed to see any of them.

She claims she had left before the murder was committed.  

'Wouldn't there have been physical evidence?' she told ABC.

'I mean, duct tape is some sticky stuff, yet there's no finger prints, no DNA, no hair.'

Both women had never been to jail before they were arrested.

Now they spend 24 hours a day locked in a cell together.

Three times a week they are allowed outside for two hours, but the area is concrete.  

'I haven't touched grass in six years,' Carr said. 

'So it's the small stuff you take for granted, you really do.'

Carr struggles being away from her kids, but said she has taught herself to deal with it.

'I think about them every day,' she said. 

'Before I really even came to know God, that was the hardest thing for me to cope with day in and day out, was being away from my kids.

'When I got here, my hair was falling out just from stress.'

Both women have lodged appeals, however the process takes an average of 10 to 12 years.

They are not fighting their convictions, but want their sentences reduced from death to life in prison.

They are both convinced they will not be executed.

'You can't have that mentality (that you're going to die), because that means you've accepted this,' Carr said.

'You've already died... you're already dead if you accept that,' Cole said.

The women spend their days reading books.

They are both religious and say that god and self-help books have turned their lives around.

'It's not over,' Cole said. 

'There is forgiveness and there is hope.' 

However, the prosecutor in Cole's case, Jay Plotkin, thinks differently, telling ABC News: 'I was a prosecutor for more than 20 years. There was not any case that I prosecuted where the crime was more vile or cruel than the torture and murder of the Sumners. 

'This case lingers on in the heart and soul of our community. 

'Ms. Cole is certainly entitled to, and should, exhaust all of her legal rights to appeal. 

'I am personally confident that she received more than adequate representation and a fair trial.'
