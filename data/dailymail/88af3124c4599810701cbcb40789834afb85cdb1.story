FIFA will not be taking action against Arjen Robben after he admitted diving during Holland's 2-1 win over Mexico.

Robben reportedly apologised for diving on one occasion in the game - but not for the decisive penalty in stoppage time which he said was 'definitely a foul'.

FIFA head of media Delia Fischer said the disciplinary committee would only look retrospectively at 'serious infringements' of fair play rules - diving only carries a yellow card sanction - and that Robben would face no action.

'Out of four matches we had three where the refereeing was disastrous and this was the worst,' said Herrerra.

'Robben
 did three dives for penalties that didn’t exist. He had to be 
cautioned.

'If you do that to the guy who tries to cheat, then he can’t 
cheat again.

'Robben
 should have got a second card. If you don’t do anything as a referee, 
the player carries on.

'He knows he won’t be expelled from the pitch so 
he carries on.

'But then when they send a referee from the same confederation where they have a team, this is what happens.

'The referee gave a penalty that was invented by him. The least we can hope is that this gentleman goes home just like us.’

She
 told a news conference in Rio de Janeiro: 'Simulation is not something 
we want to see on the field of play but the referees are trained to 
identify these simulations and punish them by showing yellow cards.

'The disciplinary committee will look into serious infringements.

'We appeal to the spirit of fair play which is the over-arching message we have.'

It comes after the
 Dutch FA claim Robben's confession to diving in the World Cup has
 been misinterpreted, and say the Holland winger admitted he was 
'falling too easily'.

The
 Dutch FA said: 'KNVB is unpleasantly surprised by publications in the 
media about the Dutch penalty in the match versus Mexico.

'Media have interpreted statements from Robben in a Dutch post match interview completely wrong.

'In a studio interview with Dutch broadcaster NOS, the forward stated that the decision of the referee to give a penalty in the second half of the game was perfectly right.

'However, in the same interview Robben referred to two situations earlier in the match (first half), when he was brought down.

'The 
striker stated that in one of those situations he should have been 
granted a penalty, but that in the other case he was falling too easily.

'Later today Arjen Robben will make a statement in a press conference after the training of the Netherlands team in Rio.'

Training at Estadio Gavea started at 11.30am, and Wesley Sneijder will join Robben in the media conference.

Robben
 remains adamant his 93rd-minute penalty was genuine, but admitted going
 to ground too easily earlier in the match during an interview.

'I
 must apologise,' said Robben. 'The one (at the end) was a penalty, but 
the other one was a dive in the first half. I shouldn't be doing that. 
That’s awful.’
