Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has told his own children that learning to cook is a 'life skill' and more important than exam results.

The outspoken restaurant owner has revealed that he recently told his son Jack, 15, to stop stressing over a Latin exam and concentrate on improving his skills in the kitchen.

He believes the childhood obesity epidemic is down to parents who don't know how to make nutritious food and insisted cooking will help youngsters more than academic achievements.

Despite leaving school with little qualifications and a failed football career, the 48-year-old now has a multi-million pound culinary empire.

'I'm fed up with kids getting blamed for this obesity epidemic and bad eating habits. It's not the kids, it's the parents,' he said in an interview on the David Letterman show. 

'Cooking is now a proper life skill for the young kids. I look at my son Jack and he's stressing out over Latin.

'I'm saying to him "Mate, if you're not going to use Latin for the rest of your life, don't worry about that exam, follow dad, let me show you how to make scrambled eggs".

'The good news is that now, every Saturday or Sunday, our four kids cook for us. I've got them up to speed and they're bloody good cooks.'

He explained that the importance of cooking was instilled in him from an early age as his mother Helen Cosgrove worked as a chef in Stratford-upon-Avon while he was growing up.

'Mum worked in a little tea house called the Cobweb Tea Room - it was packed with American's and she was cooking classic English food.

'She used to bring home what she didn't sell back home. It amazes me today how she just got on with it and never cursed.

'Back in those days it was rude to leave anything so you ate and washed up straight afterwards. Today you have issues with kids even loading the dishwasher.'

The father-of-four, who is currently teaching children in the United States to cook for the new series of Masterchef Junior, said the young contestants were better learners than adults.

Speaking on the Late Show this week, he said: 'Some of the kids are eight years of age and can barely reach the stove but they are extraordinary.

'Working with them and getting a chance to teach them is great.

'They absorb far better than adults, they are less sensitive, we get straight to the point when we have an issue or a stumbling block.

'Those kind of life skills are important to give a bit of confidence,' he added. 'I don't scream at the kids but I scream at the parents.'

Ramsay's daughter Matilda, 13, is set to front her own cookery show called 'Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch', which will be aired on CBBC later this year.

The series will see the teenager travel to Los Angeles to creates dishes to accompany Bollywood themed parties, stunt lessons at a film studio, daredevil zip-wiring and surf days on the beach. 

He also has two other daughters, Megan and Holly, with his wife of almost 20 years, Cayetana - also known as Tana.

The 48-year-old celebrity chef is well-known for his award-winning restaurants, string of TV programmes and his outspoken nature.

He was born in Renfrewshire, Scotland in 1966 and moved to Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire when he was five, where his mother had a job as a chef.

In his autobiography, he describes his childhood as being marked by abuse and neglect by his alcoholic father, and when he was 16 he moved out of home to Banbury, Oxfordshire.

He had a promising football career and in 1984 had a trial with Glasgow Rangers, the team he supported as a boy. He claims to have played two first team games for the club and was signed at the age of 15.

But after suffering a serious injury that left him unable to regain full fitness he was released from the club.

His first experiences of a professional kitchen came from a couple of weekend jobs - first as a washer up in an Indian restaurant and then washing up in a Banbury hotel. This was when his interest in becoming a chef started. 

Having only obtained a few O levels at school he was left with limited options and decided to enroll on a catering course at North Oxford Technical College. 

In 1993 Gordon became chef of Aubergine in London, which within three years, was awarded two Michelin stars. In 1998, at the age of 31, Ramsay set up his first wholly owned and namesake restaurant, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, which quickly received three Michelin stars.

He first appeared on television in documentaries Boiling Point (1998) and Beyond Boiling Point (2000), but had appeared previously as a judge on a masterchef-like series for young catering students in 1997.

He has gone on to appear in his own programme - Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, The F Word and Hell's Kitchen - aired both in the UK and U.S.
