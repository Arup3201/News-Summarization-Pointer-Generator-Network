Lewis Hamilton has revealed that he still loves Nicole Scherzinger and still hopes they could get back together.

The Formula One star and the pop singer split up last month after four years together as the strain of barely seeing each other took its toll.

It is understood that Hamilton's failure to commit to starting a family further undermined their relationship and forced them apart.

Still in love: Lewis Hamilton flew to Los Angeles to attempt a reconciliation with Hawaiian born beauty Nicole Scherzinger

The break-up resulted in Hamilton adopting a negative attitude and, combined with poor results and incidents on the track, the 26-year-old has cut a forlorn figure for a number of weeks.

That appeared to be underlined this week when pictures were published of what looked like a frosty reunion in a Los Angeles car park between him and US X-Factor judge Scherzinger.

But as he prepared for this Sunday's final race of the F1 season, the Brazilian Grand Prix, in Sao Paulo, he said that could not be further from the truth.

Sporting a long black set of rosary 
beads overlaid with white gold given to him by his ex as a present in 
LA, Hamilton said of the photographs: 'Well, they didn't catch us at the
best of times.

'What you 
didn't see is that we had a really good week, a couple of really nice 
lunches together. We had a really nice dinner together.

'It's very early days and we still have very strong feelings for one another. I still love her very much.

'Amicable': The pair announced their split last month but Hamilton who has 'fond memories' hopes for a reconciliation

'So, who knows? Maybe we will be together in the future.'

Hamilton's trip to the United States also included a visit to New York in which he 'got to hang with Mary J Blige, Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz in the studio, which was really cool'.

Hamilton could now not be more upbeat ahead of the weekend, saying: 'I'm very much here in a positive frame of mind.

'I am very happy to be here, I've great memories of being here in the past.

'Actually she (Scherzinger) was here with me when I won the world championship (in 2008), so I've very good memories.

'But certainly it was a really positive few days which meant more to me than a race win, so I came away from LA feeling great and things are different, so that's cool.

'I've a lot of positive energy at the moment.'

Hopeful: Lewis is keen to give the relationship another go
