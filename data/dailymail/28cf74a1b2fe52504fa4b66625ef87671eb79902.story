Paving slabs bearing lyrics written by convicted paedophile Ian Watkins and laid in his home town will be torn up following complaints from disgusted residents.

The words - once read with pride in a street in the singer's home town of Pontypridd, South Wales - now serve as an unwelcome reminder of the town's links to the former Lostprophets frontman, they say.

Watkins, 36, pleaded guilty at Cardiff Crown Court last month to a host of sickening offences including two counts of attempted rape of a baby.

Parents in the hometown of paedophile rock star Ian Watkins are calling for paving slabs bearing his lyrics to be ripped up from their high street

The disgraced Lostprophets singer allowed his lyrics to be engraved in the shopping centre pavement just months before he was arrested for 'depraved' child sex offences

The 11th-hour admissions, which have shocked and sickened fans and the general public alike, came as he was about to stand trial accused of 24 separate sex offences.

And details of the singer's perverted sexual appetite have continued to emerge.

Family, friends, fans and former bandmates have all spoken of their shock and horror at the despicable secret life of debauchery he led for years.

Watkins will be sentenced on December 18.

The 10 paving slabs transcribed with lyrics from the song Streets Of Nowhere were laid with pride in Taff Street last year.

Part
 of a civic regeneration project seeking to highlight the area's culture
 and successes, Watkins' words state: 'Every time I walk these streets I
 know they're mine.'

His words are on public display along with lyrics from Green Green Grass Of Home, a hit for Sir Tom Jones, another local.

'I think that the paving was originally put down in good faith when there was a lot of pride locally surrounding the Lostprophets,' said Labour AM Mick Antoniw.

'Since then there have been a number of concerns raised and quite a lot of shock in Pontypridd about the detail of what he did.

'This was something that was put in 
place and intended for people to take pride in. The feeling is that it 
should be ripped up now.

'It's
 not something that the council should make a song and dance about but I
 think that these pavings should be discreetly removed.'

 Jenkins, 53, said: 'The town was very proud of Ian and his band for 
doing so well but now we just want to wash our hands of him.

'What he did was beyond sick and he should be scrubbed from the town's history.

His pop lyrics 'Every time I walk these streets I know they're mine' now have a sinister double meaning after he prayed on fans and their babies

'He doesn't deserve to sit alongside the likes of Tom Jones.'

Claude Knights, chief executive of the child protection charity Kidscape, said Watkins's crimes are 'appalling' and had 'tainted' his songs.

He said: 'It would be wise for the council to consider taking the slabs up. His work has been tainted.'It should be removed for the sake of the local community.'

Lostprophets were founded in Pontypridd in 1997 and the band sold about 3.5 million albums worldwide.

His former bandmates have turned their back on him - saying they are 'heartbroken, angry, and disgusted' at his sex crimes and have urged more of his victims to contact police.

A council spokesman said: 'Rhondda Cynon Taf Council can confirm that granite paving featuring song lyrics written by convicted paedophile Ian Watkins will be removed from the streetscape of Pontypridd as soon as possible.'
