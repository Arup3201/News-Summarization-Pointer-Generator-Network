The concept of glorious defeat finds no favour with international footballers. And properly so, since anything less than victory equals failure. So the young men of England will take no consolation from this heart-wrenching result. And yet there was glory aplenty to be found in a genuinely memorable performance Saturday night.

This was not one of those sleeves -up, show-your-passion, play-for-the shirt displays beloved of so many earlier England teams.

Rather, it was enormously skilful, marvelously heartening and authentically inspired. It took a shrewd, capable and massively experienced Italy team to their mental and physical limits. And it vividly demonstrated the wealth of emerging talent on which the country may now call.

England have not figured prominently in Brazil’s World Cup calculations. When waiters, taxi-drivers and bartenders — all the usual oracles — have offered their forecasts, they have naturally tended to cite the home team, along with Argentina, Germany and Italy.

If England were ever mentioned, we sensed that politeness rather than confidence was the motive. As for English players, Wayne Rooney won the odd glimmer of recognition, but the most popular by far was a non-combatant, D Beckham.

And England favoured this relative anonymity. After the wasted years of the so-called ‘golden generation’, this is a quite different camp. By common consent, the preparations were ideal; young men with reputations still to win submerging their egos and eagerly subscribing to the team ethic.

Equally impressive was the approach of 
Roy Hodgson. Lazily categorised as a cautiously defensive coach, for 
this, the most important match his nation have played in four years, 
Hodgson sent out the most adventurous England team in more than a 
decade.

Only three of the England starting XI had experience of the World Cup finals. On the one hand, it spoke of naivety. On the other, it ensured that the majority had been spared the extended calamity of South Africa in 2010.

Back home, it seems, some of the old optimism had finally emerged. It remains one of sport’s most perplexing phenomena, the ability of the English football fan to obliterate past experience and dream of the end of the rainbow.

Mercifully, it has been relatively restrained these past months, but it was simply biding its time. Brazilian television chose to illustrate this by visiting a pub in London’s Kentish Town. ‘Who’s going to win, lads,’ inquired the Brazilian Paxman. ‘Ing-er- land!!’ bawled the drinkers, with much fist -pumping.

But while the game began with 
appropriate discretion in the Amazonian heat, the chief obstacle to 
English ambitions began to assert himself. Andrea Pirlo is elegantly 
professorial, treating the game as if it were a series of problems 
awaiting solution. He padded stealthily through the heart of midfield, 
shaping a pass here, throwing a feint there, generally organising 
affairs to his own satisfaction.

It was one such deception which allowed Claudio Marchisio a low drive through a crowd to defeat Joe Hart after 35 minutes.

England could consider themselves rather harshly done by at that stage, but the spirit engendered over the past months would not be subdued. The equaliser was a small masterpiece, from Rooney’s  exquisite chipped cross to Daniel Sturridge’s thunderous finish. One imagines it went down rather well in Kentish Town.

England were fortunate to escape reprisal for the remainder of the half, but the young men never stopped believing, working, earning the right to play.

It may not have been football to distract the Saturday-night neutrals on Copacabana, but it was honest and thoughtful and utterly compelling.

All the more reason, then, to curse the sublime goal which Mario Balotelli, formerly of the Manchester parish, put away in 50 minutes. Mario once revealed his celebrated persecution complex with a plaintive T-shirt slogan: ‘Why Always Me?’. Because, when his mind is on his game, he is capable of goals like this.

The more the game progressed, the more we recognised that the selection of Raheem Sterling was no gamble but a piece of irrefutable logic. In years to come, England  followers will speak of the torrid evening in Amazonas State as the night the boy came of age.

A dashing,
 darting, impish presence, he sought responsibility and used it 
admirably. The heart lifted in thrilling expectation each time he found 
himself on the ball. Whatever the rest of this World Cup has in store 
for England, Sterling will surely emerge as a major international 
talent.

Ultimately, the collective effort proved in vain. A couple of chances from Rooney might have gone in on a kinder occasion, as might Leighton Baines’s free-kick; wickedly struck and urgently saved.

But Italy had worked themselves unsparingly, and their reserves of top-class experience finally  prevailed.

Indeed, in added time, Professor Pirlo actually found the energy to bounce a free-kick off the England bar. A two-goal advantage would have been cruelly misleading.

Things are not over, not by a long way. There is work to be done, important football to be played. But the England youngsters have made their mark on this tournament. Brazil will ignore them no longer.

For they know that the boys can play … as Kentish Town could have told them.
