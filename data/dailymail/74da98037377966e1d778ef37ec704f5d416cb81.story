This is the moment an amateur photographer tried to take a picture of a lake - and was photo-bombed by a swan.

Jason Garton, 39, was trying to capture a landscape image of the picturesque Priorslee Lake, near Telford, Shropshire.

But as the dad-of-one held out his mobile phone to take a picture he was interrupted by an unexpected visitor who jumped into the shot.

Boo! This swan leapt out of the water and photo-bombed Mr Garton's shot of Priorslee Lake near Telford in Shropshire

The comical image Mr Garton captured shows a glum-looking swan with his head resting on the side of the jetty - looking straight into the camera.

Mr Garton, who is a police officer, was out walking with his wife Melanie, 26, and two-year-old daughter Abbie when he took the incredible image on Saturday.

He said:'It was a nice day so we decided to walk around the lake so my daughter could see the ducks.

'As a keen photographer I thought I’d take some pictures of the lake as it is quite pretty.

'But as I was crouching down to get a decent vantage point a swan leapt into shot just as I pressed the button.

'Its head came out of the water and rested on the jetty just inches from my camera phone.

'I must admit, it made me jump a bit.'

Although it wasn’t the scenic picture Mr Garton was expecting to take, he was delighted with the results.

He said: 'I couldn’t believe it when I saw the image - it is hilarious.

'The swan does look a bit sad though, maybe he was upset I didn’t have any bread.

'It came out nicely though - under the conditions.'
