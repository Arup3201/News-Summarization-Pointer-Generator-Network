A millionaire Tory donor missed out on the top job at Ofsted yesterday, putting an end to a simmering Coalition row.

David Ross, co-founder of Carphone Warehouse, had been backed by Michael Gove when he was Education Secretary.

But his successor Nicky Morgan has announced that David Hoare will become chairman of the schools watchdog in September.

The appointment of the businessman, a trustee of the UK’s largest chain of academy schools, is far less controversial.

Last night the move was welcomed by the Liberal Democrats, who said they hoped it was a sign that calm was being restored to the Department for Education.

Mrs Morgan said Mr Hoare ‘has the expertise in leadership and governance crucial to helping Ofsted through a significant period of change and reform’.

She added: ‘He is also passionate about education and his work with academies across the country shows he shares my commitment to ever higher standards.’

Mr Hoare, current chairman of mail company DX Group, has worked with the Academies Enterprise Trust, which runs around 70 state-funded schools.

He said he was looking forward to working closely with the Chief Inspector of Schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, to raise standards - particularly for disadvantaged pupils.

‘Ofsted has a key role helping to improve the leadership of our schools and the performance of our pupils. I look forward to being part of the team,’ Mr Hoare added.

The move comes after a bitter battle within the Coalition - with accusations by the Liberal Democrats that former education secretary Michael Gove was trying to politicise the job.

Lib Dem Schools Minister David Laws was said to have been furious when Mr Gove announced in February that current Ofsted chair Baroness Morgan - a former senior aide to Tony Blair - would not have her contract extended.

The Lib Dems were further enraged by reports that Mr Gove was lining up Mr Ross to take over the position.

However Mr Gove's demotion to Chief Whip in David Cameron's reshuffle earlier this month and his replacement by Mrs Morgan appears to have cleared the way for the dispute to be settled.

Mr Hoare has been chairman of a number of companies including Virgin Express, Paragon Group and Laura Ashley and is chairman of the Teenage Cancer Trust.
