Rapist: Frank Van Den Bleeken is to be put to death after a court granted him the right to euthanasia

A rapist and murderer has had his permission to commit assisted suicide overturned by the Belgian government 

Justice Minister Koen Geens said Frank Van Den Bleeken, who  has been locked up for almost three decades, would be given a chance for a 'qualitatively decent life.'

The prisoner had argued that he had no prospect of release because he cannot overcome his violent sexual impulses and wants to end years of mental anguish.

Van Den Bleeken, 51, was set to commit medically assisted suicide at a prison in Bruges this week.

A spokesman for Belgian justice minister Koen Geens earlier told the newspaper De Morgen: 'Euthanasia will indeed be implemented. The time has come.'

Now that decision has been reversed, Van Den Bleeken will instead be taken to a special facility for observation. 

The ruling by the justice ministry allowing the death was the first involving a prisoner since the country's euthanasia law was introduced 13 years ago.

Van Den Bleeken, who has been in prison for nearly 30 years, said he preferred to die because there was no therapy for his condition in Belgium.

The country is not the only one in Europe to provide a right to die but it has pioneered the use of the law beyond the terminally ill.

Among cases that hit the headlines were those of deaf twins who were losing their sight, and a transgender patient left in torment by an unsuccessful sex-change.

It is also the first country to allow euthanasia for terminally ill children at any age.

Belgium legalised euthanasia in 2002, the second country in the world to do so after the Netherlands, and logged a record 1,807 cases of euthanasia in 2013.

Its strict conditions for a mercy killing include that patients must be capable, conscious and have presented a 'voluntary, considered and repeated' request to die.
