Not charged: Edward Friel called the cops on his grandson Justin Friel, 17 (pictured) on Saturday morning, claiming he was 'lazy' and had punched a hole in the wall

A frustrated grandfather called 911 to report he was fed up with his 'lazy' teenage grandson who played computer games instead of helping around the house.

Edward Friel told responding officers that 17-year-old Justin Friel punched a hole in the kitchen wall and stormed out of their South Amhurst, Ohio home on Saturday morning after a fight over chores.

According to a police report obtained by The Smoking Gun, Justin disappeared into the woods after his 72-year-old grandfather cut the internet cable cord because he wouldn't stop playing games.

He also allegedly swore at his granddad and didn't listen to instructions.

'Mr Friel stated he had asked Justin to do some work around the house but continued to play on the computer,' the Lorain County 
Sheriffâ€™s Office report states.

'Mr Friel advised he cut the internet cable cord since he [Justin] was not listening to him.'

Friel, who has custody of his grandson, chose not to pursue charges.

He said the teen did not threaten him, but he was tired of him being 'lazy'.

Police have closed the case.
