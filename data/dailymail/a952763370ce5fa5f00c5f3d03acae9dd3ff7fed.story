A photographer has shared his stunning gallery of African sunrises and sunsets.

Paul Goldstein says he has spent years trying to photograph the perfect beginning and ending of the Masai Mara day.

And now thanks to his role as a travel guide, there have been countless opportunities to document the beautiful natural spectacle.

Paul Goldstein says he has spent years trying to photograph the perfect beginning and ending of the Masai Mara day

And now thanks to his role as a travel guide, there have been countless opportunities to document the beautiful natural spectacle

Mr Goldstein, from Wimbledon, explains: 'Of all the thousands of images I have taken during sunrise and sunset around the world, 90 per cent of them have been in two Mara Conservancies in Kenya - Olare and Mara North'

'The Masai Mara is well-known for having the best photographic light in the world, but these well-managed conservancies also have the best spots for sunrise and sunset and without crowds of people,' he said

Mr 
Goldstein, from Wimbledon, explains: 'Of all the thousands of images I 
have taken during sunrise and sunset around the world, 90 per cent of 
them have been in two Mara Conservancies in Kenya - Olare and Mara 
North.

'The
 Masai Mara is well-known for having the best photographic light in the 
world, but these well-managed conservancies also have the best spots for
 sunrise and sunset and without crowds of people.

'Most
 of these images were not arrived at by accident, it makes me laugh when
 people say they are up at sunrise, that is far too late; you need to be
 in position by then.

Mr 
Goldstein says combination of capricious weather, towering escarpments 
and plenty of subjects to put in the viewfinder combine to give these 
dramatic canvases.

'Almost
 always stormy weather gives the very best of all colours and frequently
 just when you are thinking of packing up as the rain lashes down.'

'You
 need to be below your subject, in position early and prepared to move 
quickly, it can be hard graft but the rewards are magnificent and the 
colours often better after the sun has set, or, the 'false' dawn before 
it has risen. It is unpredictable, this is the nature of the beast, 
literally, but it is also exciting and rewarding and frankly a drug for 
me.'

Mr Goldstein guides photographic safaris and expeditions for Exodus and is
 co-owner of Kicheche Camps in Kenya.

The Masai Mara is Kenya's best known wildlife zone, a 1530-square-kilometre expanse of grassland, savannah and scrub in the south-west of the east African country
