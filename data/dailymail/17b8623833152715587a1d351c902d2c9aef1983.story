Former Britain's Got Talent winners Ashley and Pudsey certainly learned a few of their tricks from the athletic four-legged creatures who'll be hanging around Birmingham for the next four days.

Crufts 2014 began today, and the world famous dog eventing competition has already yielded some terrific photo opportunities, with breeds big and small (and very big and very small) strutting their stuff in the NEC arena and leaping over bars in the agility tests.

Furthermore, with London Fashion Week over, it was time for our four-legged friends to show us what they have hanging in their own Spring/Summer 2014 wardrobes.

The puppy-razzi lined the streets of 
Birmingham this morning ready to snap today's entries in the Working and
 Pastoral Breeds category entering the arena, many of whom were wrapped 
up in multi-coloured waterproof onesies to protect their gleaming fur 
coats from the British drizzle. Some even wore four little dog wellies.

Recognised
 Kennel Club breeds including Old English Sheepdogs, Newfoundlands, 
Bearded Collies, Rottweilers, Dalmatians, Greyhounds, Finnish Laphunds, 
Bull Mastiffs, Alaskan Malamutes and Giant Schnauzers were lead into the
 arena by their nervous owners, to take their seats in the arena 
corridors and prepare for their presentation.

Today was the turn of the working dogs and pastoral breeds, and tomorrow the hounds and terriers get their turn

It seems onesies are not only popular in human wardrobes, but that the pedigree dogs showing at Crufts this year - such as this enormous Komondor - are also fond of them

The four-day event is the world's largest dog show, and today features competitions from 9am until 5.15pm. Categories include agility, freestyle and heelwork to music. There will also be various displays from groups including the the West Midlands Police and the East Anglian Staffordshire Bull Terriers.

There are also a number of events solely for children and their dogs.

Tomorrow's competition is for Terrier and Hound breeds, Saturday's is for Toy and Utility breeds, and on Sunday the Gundogs will compete.rufts is one of the largest dog events in the world. No longer purely a dog show, Crufts celebrates every aspect of the role that dogs play in our lives.It has changed in ways that couldn’t possibly have been imagined when the show was set up in Victorian times by the late Charles Cruft. Although it was a very different event in 1891 Charles Cruft was a great showman and would surely have enjoyed the size and scope of the event today, which is an essential date in any dog lover’s calendar.

Crufts began in the Victorian period, set up by dog fanatic and showman Charles Cruft in 1891 to celebrate dogs and the role they play in our lives.

It has evolved since the 19th century, but still has this celebration of dogs at its heart. As organisers say: 'Judges are trained to ensure that only
 healthy dogs win prizes, which in turn encourages the breeding of 
healthy dogs. But the event is now about so much more besides.

'Crufts is ultimately a celebration of all dogs. It celebrates working dogs, which are fit and healthy enough to perform the jobs for which they were originally bred, such as those in the Gamekeeper classes or which line up for the Police Dog Team Operational and Humanitarian Action of the Year award, and it hails hero dogs through the Friends for Life competition.

'Rescue dogs are celebrated in the rescue dog agility competition and the speed and agility of dogs is celebrated in the ever popular competitions of Flyball and Heelwork to Music.'

The first Crufts show was held in 1981 in the Royal Agricultural Hall in Islington.
