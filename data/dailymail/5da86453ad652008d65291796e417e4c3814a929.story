A woman who was glassed by a stranger has released pictures of her injuries in a fury after her attacker walked free from court.

Caitlin Morrell, 21, was on a night out with a friend when Stephanie Murfet thrust a glass tumbler into her face.

Murfet, 22, was handed a suspended jail sentence at Cambridge Crown Court.

But Miss Morrell, who has a scar across her cheek, said she showed no remorse.

She said: ‘She walked out past the public gallery and that’s the first time I’d seen her since she glassed me. She didn’t look at me but she was smiling. That made my blood boil.’

She added that she ‘felt like her brain had exploded’ in the attack at the Townhouse pub in Ely on February 22. Miss Morrell had had an altercation with a friend who had started seeing her ex.

Shortly afterwards, Murfet – who she had never met – pushed a glass into her face.

Miss Morrell, of Ely, Cambridgeshire, said: ‘This little thing was in my face having a go at me. I literally didn’t know who she was.

‘The bar staff described me as the tall blonde in a bright blazer and they described her as the short, frumpy one.’ She said she had been told Murfet attacked her because she was jealous of her.

She added that the attack left her so traumatised her hair started to fall out. She said: ‘I couldn’t sleep. Every time I tried to I would see a glass coming towards my face. My mum was heartbroken. We cried a lot.’

Miss Morrell was forced to delay her training as a hairdresser, which she has now completed. She said: ‘I don’t want her to affect my life any more.’

Murfet, of Littleport, Cambridgeshire, admitted assault and was given a 21-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, on Monday. Judge Gareth Hawkesworth said she ‘has never been in trouble and it seems to be out of character’.

Murfet was also given 200 hours’ unpaid work and must pay £750 compensation and £250 costs.

The unprompted attack left Miss Morrell with a large scar and also destroyed the hairdresser's confidence
