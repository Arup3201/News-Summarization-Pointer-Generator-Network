When you're a news anchor reading the bulletin live on air, you need to prepare for all eventualities.

So when an earthquake began to shake a television studio in Chile, presenter Christián Pino managed to stay calm.

As he read a late-night bulletin for Chile's National TV (TVN) on Monday, the set shook and the sound was temporarily disrupted.

Keeping his cool: Although he did look nervous, and at one point clenched his fist into a ball, by the end of the broadcast, he was visisbly relaxed and was even smiling

But in a sign of true professionalism, Mr Pino carried on with the news after attempting to reassure the audience that nothing major had happened- although he was gripping the sides of his desk.

'While the building is not falling down, you have to be there,' he said in an interview with La Nación.

'If one does not transmit calm to the viewer, if I seem nervous or I fail in my effort to stay calm at a time like this, is a bad sign, because the first thing people do in an emergency is to turn on the TV.'

The strong, magnitude-6.7 earthquake rocked central Chile, prompting authorities to order a preventative evacuation of a stretch of coastline, causing hundreds of people to flee buildings in panic and shaking up the visiting prime minister of Canada.

There were no reports of major damage, but authorities in the port city of Valparaiso said a 72-year-old man died of a heart attack during the quake, which was felt for almost a minute in Valparaiso and the capital, Santiago.
