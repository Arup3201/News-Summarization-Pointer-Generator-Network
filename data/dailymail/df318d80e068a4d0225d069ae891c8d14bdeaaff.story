Temporal power was given its customary rebuke. Political obsequies always do this. Under the vaults of some great church, sleek potentates gather, their fading predecessors a few rows back.

Then the coffin arrives — cold, clammy death — and all else dwindles.

Magnificoes, present and past, paraded at St Paul’s. We saw faces once familiar, now sunken and lined.

This was Thatcherdom’s (as opposed to Thatcherism’s) last hurrah.

Loyal to the last: Norman Tebbit (left) had sided with Mrs Thatcher against the rebels. Right, Lord Carrington

A stooped Geoffrey Howe and his ever-attendant Elspeth, a bespectacled Heseltine. Was there something lonely behind the old assassin’s eyes? But he was right to attend. Unthawed Kinnock didn’t.

Douglas Hurd, nobly scarecrowish, braved his fraility to show respects to the woman he served as Home Secretary and more.

Trade ace Lord Young, her problem solver, was loyal to the end. He sat near Tom King, who as Northern Ireland Secretary was with her at Hillsborough Castle in 1985.

The front row went to the Queen and gallant Prince Philip. Alongside them were our surviving prime ministers, come to salute a lost member of the club. Wilson, Heath, Callaghan, Thatcher have all now gone.

Run faster, my friends. History is catching up with us. We must elude it while we can.Camerons, Blairs, Majors, Browns sat together.

Maggie's mouthpiece: Formidable press secretary Bernard Ingham

Sam Cam had tripped in all sparky-toothed, dressed elfin coquette. Her outfit gave this funeral almost the look of a smart wedding.

It was a day for tails (Ed Miliband tidy in his) and one or two top hats. Under the brim of one enormous titfer trundled former Speaker Betty Boothroyd. Now there is a Labour lady who knows how to behave.

Beethoven’s funeral dirge came blowing up Ludgate Hill, through the cathedral’s great west door, right down the waiting congregation’s spine. The military spectacle was immense in its precision.

Colonel Hugh Bodington, officer commanding, had done his stuff.

The pallbearers reached the top of the cathedral steps and in that very instant all living ambition was subdued. Paul’s Epistle to Timothy: ‘We brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out.’ Hear that, O Westminster.

Boyish at 73: John Selwyn Gummer (left). David Mellor (right) made sure he stood out

Israel’s serving premier, Benjamin Netanyahu, had been parked near Australia’s ex-PM, John Howard.

Between them was Poland’s Lech ‘Solidarity’ Walesa, who with Mrs T did much to undo the Soviet empire. If anyone doubted Margaret Thatcher’s global reach, here was proof.

Mr Walesa can be excused not singing along to I Vow To Thee, My Country. Which of us would be able to belt out Zeby Polska Byla Polska?

Former U.S. vice-president Dick Cheney looked unfamiliar with the tune to Love Divine, but he may just be a grunter.

Every congregation has a few. Was that Henry Kissinger’s singing voice or was it the mighty St Paul’s organ parping its bottom bass B? Hard to say.

White South Africa’s F. W. de Klerk was chewing something. Gum? Biltong? Canada’s ex-PM, Brian Mulroney, was there for the Senior Dominion.

Still smooth: Ex-cabinet minister Cecil Parkinson as he arrived at St Paul's Cathedral

Alongside these world names were domestic political egos of old. Sometime Energy Minister Tim Eggar looked distrait.

David Mellor made sure he was noticed. Francis Maude, still in the game but originally a Thatcher boy, pushed away a tear.

Charles Powell, always drawn to feisty women, seemed to be acting as walker to the Duchess of York. Tim Renton, Mrs T’s last (not entirely strong) Chief Whip, was in the body of the kirk.

That stoical walnut Lord Tebbit lent enthusiastic voice during Bunyan’s To Be A Pilgrim, but when it came to the part ‘there’s no discouragement’ was he perhaps tempted to tweak it to ‘would make her once relent’?

The event had drawn not only her own side, such as ‘Wee Free’ former Lord Chancellor James Mackay, once-dashing Jonathan Aitken and Sir Bernard Ingham with his eyebrows. Now there’s a test for any Black and Decker hedge trimmer.

Mourners had come from other parties, too.

David Steel and David Owen, the one-time Alliance duo who in their own way helped Mrs T stay in power, were next to one another, paired for perpetuity.

All ears: (From left to right) Former Prime Minister John Major, Samantha Cameron and Prime Minister David Cameron listen attentively during the funeral service of Baroness Thatcher

Compare and contrast: International development 
minister Alan Duncan decided to wear the 
full uniform of a member of the Privy Council, in stark contrast to 
Boris Johnson's crumpled navy blue suit

Differences aside: Former political foes Gordon Brown and Cherie Blair put on friendly faces during the solemn occasion

Gordon Brown and his wife Sarah both wore black as a mark of respect to the former Conservative leader

Leader of the Labour Party Ed Miliband with his barrister wife Justine Thornton joined a host of other politicians to pay their last respects

The coffin is presented in front of the 2,300 mourners within St Paul's Cathedral

Great and the good: The entire Cabinet and dozens of senior politicians were among the mourners

Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha arrived for the service, joining world leaders and Baroness Thatcher's friends and relatives

Former Prime Ministers John Major and Tony Blair with their wives Norma Major and Cherie Blair joined the Queen in the ceremony

Chancellor George Osborne and his wife Frances Osborne arrive ahead of the emotional service, where he and David Cameron shed a tear

Even Eurocrat Jose Manuel Barroso was there. Tony Blair, at the end, gave him a chummy thumbs-up. Blair briefly seemed to think he was the host!

When the Bishop of London gave that strong address about how Lady Thatcher’s ‘no such thing as society’ line had been misunderstood, what can Nick Clegg have felt?

He misquoted it to his own shifty purposes only the other day.

The Prayer Book’s glories were nearing their conclusion. The Archbishop of Canterbury, whose crisp sign of the Cross has something of a window cleaner reaching into every last crevice, gave his blessing. ‘The fever of life is over.’

Those stalwart lads in Garrison Sgt-Major Mott’s bearer party marched back up the nave and resumed their burden.

And as the coffin was carried out, to  Stanford’s Nunc Dimittis, the Queen shot it a rueful, almost wary look.

Former Conservative leader Michael Howard, who helped minimise the Conservative party's rebellion against the poll tax when it was introduced, and wife Sarah were among the hundreds of mourners

The former chairman of Sotheby's and minister Lord Gowrie, who famously resigned from Government because he said his salary wasn't enough to live on in London, arrived to pay his respects

Former Conservative MP Michael Portillo (centre) and former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil (left) were smartly dressed as they joined dignitaries and world leaders for the funeral

Both clad in black, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip stand outside St Paul's Cathedral. Her Majesty has only ever attended one other 'commoner' funeral - that of Sir Winston Churchill

Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper attended the funeral of the Iron Lady, who has been praised as one of the UK's great reformers

Israel's Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) and Australia's former prime Minister John Howard (right) were among the many foreign dignitaries who came

John Bercow (left) arrives for the funeral service of Baroness Thatcher without his wife Sally, who reportedly refused to attend. He was joined by another mourner, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats Simon Hughes

Oliver Letwin, Minister for Government Policy, chatted to fellow guests who were among 2,000 invited to the ceremony, including Sir Peter Bottomley and his wife Virginia

Lord Owen, who served as British Foreign Secretary from 1977 to 1979, and former MP Baron Steel, attended the emotional ceremony that had many in tears
