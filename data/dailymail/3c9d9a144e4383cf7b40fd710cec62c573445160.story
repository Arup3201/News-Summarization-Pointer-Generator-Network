Banks in an independent Scotland would be at risk of an Iceland-style meltdown which saw savers lose billions, a leading ratings agency has warned.

Standard and Poor’s sounded the alarm after figures showed the assets of Scottish lenders would be more than 10 times bigger than the entire country’s economy.

It would leave the government unable to guarantee savings in the event of a collapse, echoing the crisis which engulfed Iceland in 2008 when all of its banks were allowed to fail.

The assets of banks in an independent Scotland would outstrip the entire economy by more than the peak in Iceland, where banks failed in 2008

It is the latest major warning about the financial uncertainties facing Scotland if voters decide to back independence in September’s referendum.

First Minister Alex Salmond has repeatedly claimed Scotland has the economic muscle to go it alone.

Before the financial crash he used to point to Iceland as part of an ‘arc of posterity’ which showed small economies could thrive.

But in 2008, Iceland’s banks crashed. With assets totalling 880 per cent of GDP, the government of the small country was unable to bail them out and billions were lost.

Some 340,000 savers lost deposits when Icesave collapsed, 200,000 of which were British.

Alex Salmond has unveiled proposals for high-speed cross-Border trains from an independent Scotland in a St George's Day pitch to English voters.

In a brazen attempt to convince business leaders in northern England to back the break-up of Britain, he said a 'feasibility study' will be launched in an effort to slash journey times to Cumbria, Leeds and Manchester.

Marking England's national day at an event in Carlisle, Mr Salmond said Westminster plans for high-speed rail - known as HS2 - will take 'decades to spread up from the South'.

The UK Government has already announced proposals to include Edinburgh and Glasgow in a third phase of the HS2 network.

However, if Scotland becomes an independent country, Coalition sources have warned there would be no economic case for building north of Manchester and Leeds because there are no major population centres on their side of the Border.

The First Minister said joint plans for a high-speed rail link were already being discussed with Westminster.

But he added: 'An independent Scotland could do more. Rather paying our share of the borrowing costs for high-speed rail, as we wait decades for it to spread up from the south, we can use that money to build high-speed rail from the north instead.'

Governments in Britain and the Netherlands were forced to repay £3.18 billion to members of the public who lost their deposits when Icesave, an online subsidiary of Iceland's Landsbanki, collapsed in the 2008 crisis.

According to latest estimates, banks in an independence Scotland would have assets worth 1,200 per cent of GDP.

As a result, an independent Scotland would be unable to guaranatee the savings held in banks which went to the wall, Standard and Poor’s said.

‘In our view, the willingness and ability of a future Scottish government to support its banking system is challenging at this point, not least because system assets could be over 1,000 per cent of Scottish GDP. A new banking market would mean additional costs and risks.’

Even joining the EU – as Mr Salmond hopes to do - would not be enough to protect the banks’ assets.

‘These arrangements would likely be unfunded, leaving the comparatively very sizeable deposit bases of the largest Scottish banks backed with an implicit guarantee by the Scottish government,’ S&P said.

‘We note a possible parallel here with Iceland, where in 2008 the national deposit insurance scheme could not honour claims when the country's outsized banking system failed.’

It also warned that a separate Scottish banking market would create additional costs for banks on both sides of the border.

The Scottish Government wants to share the pound in a formal currency union with the Bank of England, but all major UK parties have pointedly ruled this out.

The absence of an effective deposit guarantee scheme could see a flight of Scotland's banks across the border, it said.

A spokesman for pro-Union campaign  Better Together said: ‘Scottish savings and mortgages are more secure as part of the UK.’ But a Scottish Government spokesman said: ‘Scotland has all the attributes needed to be an economically successful independent country.’

Meanwhile, a separate survey found Scots businesses will lose a third of English customers if Mr Salmond’s bid to break up Britain succeeds.

An ICM poll found 36 per cent would be less likely to deal with companies north of the Border following a Yes vote.

Some 340,000 savers lost deposits when Icesave collapsed, 200,000 of which were British

The survey of 2,000 consumers in Scotland, England and Wales asked specifically about companies such as Scottish Widows, Scottish Power and Standard Life.

Gregor Jackson of ICM said: ‘Some of these brands are old and keeping “Scottish” in their names is perceived to be a strength, but this research suggests that in the event of a Yes vote, consumers in the rest of the UK would be less likely to deal with them.’

Iain McMillan of CBI Scotland said that after a Yes vote, Scotland would become a ‘foreign country’ to consumers south of the Border.
