Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez has today apologised for holding up a banner ridiculing Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, his former boss, during a celebratory open-top bus tour.

The Argentine forward was last night caught on TV brandishing the poster 
emblazoned with the taunt 'RIP Fergie' as he joined his team-mates on their victory lap of Manchester city centre.

The 28-year-old is thought to have been passed or thrown the placard by a fan as the squad travelled the streets with the Premier League trophy.

A Manchester City spokesman said: 'The creation of the tasteless material is in itself reprehensible and in accepting and brandishing it, Carlos has made a significant error of judgement.

'The club wishes to express its sincerest apologies to Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United Football Club for any offence or distress caused.'

The sign is thought to have been a 
reference to a remark by Ferguson three years ago when asked if United 
would ever be underdogs against City. 'Not in my lifetime,' the Scot 
said.

Tevez, who spent two 
years at Old Trafford before leaving for City in 2009, said: 'I got 
carried away in the excitement of the moment and I certainly didn't mean
any disrespect to Sir Alex Ferguson, who I admire as a man and a 
manager.'

His faux-pas was 
made in front of thousands of jubilant Manchester City fans who thronged
the streets to hail the team that has landed the club's first 
top-flight English title for 44 years.

The
sky blue open-top bus traveled through the city with members of the 
club's expensively assembled team hailing their supporters and parading the Premier League trophy.

It
is City's third league title and sparked the euphoric celebrations 
among the club's long-suffering supporters who had witnessed crosstown 
rivals United became champions for a record 19th time last season.

Before
the set off on the bus the team emerged on to a raised stage at the 
town hall to deafening applause and cheers from fans with fists punching
the air and hundreds of sky blue flags fluttering in the wind.

Manager Roberto Mancini and team 
captain Vincent Kompany appeared last on the town hall steps, carrying the Premiership trophy 
and greeted with the biggest cheer of the night.

Kompany told fans: 'I want to say thank you, you guys have been amazing.'

Mancini added: 'I think that you 
should be proud of these players. They did everything for you. They 
wanted to win this championship for you.'

Supporters
had queued from early afternoon to get a prime spot in Albert Square, 
where players thanked the fans for their support. Many
of City's army of followers were not even born before their last league
title during the club's last glory days in the 1960s.

But the team's once long-suffering fans were in party mood heralding a 'Blue Moon Rising' to mark the first of what could be many title honours for the club, now backed by oil-rich Arabs.

Goalkeeper Joe Hart told fans: 'It was one of the most dramatic days of my life...and one of the best.'

Argentinian Sergio Aguero, who scored the historic winning goal, was asked if he had cried afterwards. With team mate Pablo Zabaleta translating, Aguero confessed: 'Un Poco' - a little - as cheers rang out.

Striker Carlos Tevez said:
'It was absolutely incredible. This club have got the players that can 
win lots of trophies, this is a real big step towards that.'

Finally before the parade began, an 
explosion of sky blue and white ticker-tape and streamers shot into the 
sky as players linked arms and joined fans in a rousing rendition of 
Queen's anthem, We are the Champions.

Yesterday watched by an estimated 
160million viewers in 200 countries, City yesterday pipped their 
neighbours Manchester United to the Premier League title in the most 
amazing finish ever.

With five minutes to go in City’s home match against Queens Park Rangers, they had looked down and out. United had beaten Sunderland 1-0 to go three points ahead of City, who were losing 2-1.

But then City equalised and, with virtually the last kick of the game, their Argentinian striker Sergio Aguero made it 3-2 meaning his team were champions for the first time in 44 years, thanks to their superior goal difference.

There was pandemonium on the pitch, and in pubs and clubs around the country showing the match live. Meanwhile in Sunderland, the tearful expressions of United fans told the story of a triumph snatched from them at the very last.

Lauren Lloyd, 25, from Stockport, 
said: 'Yesterday was absolute agony then ecstasy. I still haven't come 
down. Eastlands was banging after the final whistle.'

Nat
Holmes, 22, from Manchester, added: 'Look at the City fans here 
tonight. The reds have got blase about all this, but we're proper 
Mancunian fans. This means everything to us after watching that lot from
Trafford win things year after year.'

Reception: Tens of thousands of Manchester City fans line the streets of Manchester during a victory parade by their team on an open top bus after the football club won the Premier League title

Lining the streets: Manchester City clinched the championship, their first since 1968, with a dramatic win over Queens Park Rangers yesterday pipping local rivals Manchester United to title and delighting their fans who thronged the streets

It was a sporting climax which surpassed Michael Thomas’s last-minute strike for Arsenal in 1989 which won them the League title from Liverpool; Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s Champions League-winning goal for United in 1999; and even Jonny Wilkinson’s  Rugby World Cup-winning drop goal in 2003.

Within minutes of City’s victory, football fans and celebrities were posting on Twitter, describing it as the most exhilarating end to a football season ever. Former England striker Gary Lineker said: ‘Never, ever, ever seen anything like that in my life! Congratulations to Manchester City, Premier League Champions! The most ridiculous end to the most extraordinary of seasons.’

Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson said: ‘I’m sorry. Formula One has a lot to learn from the Premiership. That Man City game was astonishing.’

QPR’s Joey Barton, who was sent off for elbowing Manchester City’s Carlos Tevez and kicked Aguero before being dragged from the field, also took to Twitter to say: ‘Can do nothing but apologise to the players and the fans.’

But the notorious troublemaker added: ‘Still don’t think it’s a sending off.’

Delighted: Manchester City fan's came out in huge numbers to celebrate their sides title win which comes after years of their club being overshadowed by their crosstown rival Manchester United

Party time: Manchester City's supporters celebrate after their remarkable win secured their first league title in nearly 50 years
