More than a dozen and a half stolen Italian artifacts, some of them more than 2,000 years old, have been seized by federal investigators and returned to their place of origin.

The treasure trove included three frescoes dating back to 63-79AD and a dog statute from 4th century BC that were recovered from the Del Mar mansion of Madeleine Pickens, the ex-wife of oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens.

The priceless artworks reportedly had been in the possession of Madeleine Pickens’ previous husband, billionaire Allen Paulson.

Officials with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations said Pickens did not know anything about the provenance of ancient artifacts, which were discovered under a blanket in the garage of the San Diego-area home in July 2012.

The frescoes and the canine figurine once belonged to a Roman senator living near Pompeii before the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79AD, reported KGTV.

The artworks were excavated in the early 1900s and were then stolen from a secure warehouse located near Naples in 1997.

Allen Paulson, an aviation businessman, died from cancer in 2000 at age 78, about two years after the artworks were stolen.

All 19 artifacts recovered by ICE were pilfered from Italy over the last several years, brought illegally into the US and then sold to different collectors.

Madeleine Pickens, who divorced her oil magnate husband in 2012, willingly surrendered the looted artworks, which are now on their way back to Italy along with a 17th century cannon, 5th century Greek pottery and several antique books. 

‘The cultural and symbolic worth of these Italian treasures far surpasses any monetary value to the Italians,’ said Anthony Scandiffio, deputy special agent in charge of HSI New York. ‘HSI remains a committed partner in the effort to ensure that we investigate individuals involved in the illicit trade and objects like these are returned to their rightful owner.’

HSI agents in New York on Wednesday seized six valuable objects, include an ancient Roman marble sarcophagus lid of Sleeping Ariadne nicknamed 'sleeping beauty.'

This 17th century cannon was among the 19 artifacts that were stolen from Italy in the past several years 

The lid was identified as part of a collection of suspected looted Italian antiquities belonging to a known trafficker who was involved in trafficking archeological items from clandestine excavation sites in Italy.

Agents in the San Francisco Bay Area also recovered a pair of stolen Italian books written in Latin dating to the 17th century.

The books, 'Stirpium Historiae' and 'Rariorm Plantarum Historia Anno 1601,' were taken from Italy's Historical National Library of Agriculture and sold to an antiquities dealer in Italy, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement. The Bay Area buyer willingly surrendered the books to investigators. 

Eleven investigations nationwide led to the recovery of the antiquities. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Rome's force for combating art and antiquities crimes helped Homeland Security Investigations officials in New York, Boston, Baltimore, Miami, San Diego and San Francisco.

'This repatriation underscores the strong level of judicial cooperation between the U.S. and Italy, and the great attention that both countries assign to the protection of cultural heritage,' said Claudio Bisogniero, Italy's ambassador to the U.S.

The US government has returned more than 7,200 artifacts to 30 countries since 2007, including paintings from France, Germany, Poland and Austria; 15th to 18th century manuscripts from Italy and Peru; and items from China, Cambodia and Iraq, the statement says.
