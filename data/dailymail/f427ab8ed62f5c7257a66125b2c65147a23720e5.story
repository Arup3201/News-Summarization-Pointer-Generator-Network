Cleared: Daniel Pytlarz outside Southwark Crown Court yesterday with his wife Urszula Nowozenivk

A masseur to the stars told of his relief yesterday after being dramatically cleared of sexually assaulting 18 women including a former employee of Sir Paul McCartney.

Daniel Pytlarz, whose clients included Nancy Dell’Olio, Sir Paul’s daughter Mary, and members of the Saudi royal family, clasped his hands over his heart as the jury of six men and six women unanimously rejected charges that he had preyed on women at his upmarket spa.

Outside court he embraced his wife, Urszula Nowozeniuk, who had supported him throughout his arrest and trial after telling friends in their native Poland that she believed the charges were ‘completely insane’.

His solicitor said the couple were 
‘relieved’ at the outcome. She added: ‘Mr Pytlarz has always maintained 
his innocence and is pleased to have at last been vindicated.’

Miss Nowozeniuk, who would have been 
only yards away when the alleged offences took place, said: ‘I have 
never had any doubts in his professionalism or his work.

‘I’ve never, never seen anything that gave me even the smallest concern that something wasn’t right.’

Mr Pytlarz, 35, was said to have 
intimately touched the women as he massaged them at the Violet Clinic 
Body and Skincare Spa in St John’s Wood, North London.

The first allegation was made by a 
former employee of Sir Paul in December 2009 as she visited the clinic 
the day before he was due to give a massage to the ex-Beatle.

The case 
was dropped after the woman declined to pursue it, but two years later 
he was re-arrested after new allegations were made.

Police subsequently sent a letter to 
all his female clients, and he was eventually charged with 21 offences 
of alleged sexual assault against 18 women.

Prosecutors claimed his 
victims included a teenage girl who visited the clinic for a 17th 
birthday treat, a music producer and two lawyers.

Relief: Mr Pytlarz with his wife and solicitor Beverley Hamblin. He bowed to the jury before leaving the dock after his five-week trial

But Mr Pytlarz was cleared after 
telling Southwark Crown Court how he would have been ‘insane’ to have 
assaulted the women as his wife, who co-owned the spa, worked in a 
nearby room.

A string of clients testified in the 
masseur’s favour and he was described by some as providing the ‘perfect’
service. His neighbour, Auschwitz survivor Ronald Leaton, called him ‘a
moral pillar in the community’.

Arm in arm: The couple head home

Jurors also heard that he was said to 
have a ‘magic touch’ and other clients believed he had ‘healing hands.’ 
Friends and even his ex-wife in his homeland told the Daily Mail they 
never believed the charges.

Mr Pytlarz, who speaks three languages
and is the son of a Polish army officer, was known by friends and 
family as a ‘golden boy’ who charmed people wherever he went.

In 2002 he took a job at a five-star hotel in Warsaw, where he met Arkadiusz Weremczuk, a flamboyant Polish fashion designer.

The pair struck up a friendship and 
the designer invited Mr Pytlarz to travel to England to be a personal 
aide to his partner, Oxford University professor Michael Gearin-Tosh, 
who had terminal cancer.

Mr Pytlarz returned to Warsaw in 2003 where he 
met Aneta Sierpinksa, whom he married following a whirlwind romance 
lasting two months.

She described him as a ‘perfect 
gentleman’ who swept her off her feet with his elegant manners and the 
stories of his glamorous life mixing with A-list stars that he met 
through his work.

She said: ‘He was a real smooth talker and told me 
about how many stars he knew. He said he was close to Christina Aguilera
and other celebrities.

‘He was determined to get into that 
celebrity world. He felt he was a nobody and he wanted to be a somebody.
He had a hunger to be close to stars. I think he saw giving massages as
getting as close as he could to famous people.’

The couple split after only four 
months, but she said: ‘Daniel never did anything to make me think he 
could hurt or abuse a woman. He was a very caring man.’

The month after his first marriage 
ended, Mr Pytlarz met Miss Nowozeniuk, who was then a law student.

He 
also began working at the Busy Body beauty salon in central London, 
where the owner, Su Koe, said he often boasted about the celebrities he 
knew.

She said: ‘He said he knew Graham Norton. On another occasion he went to a charity event where he said he met Cherie Blair.’

She said he hoped that Miss Dell’Olio 
would let him give a massage to then England football manager, Sven 
Goran Eriksson, in the hope of becoming the masseur to the England 
football team.

Claims dismissed: One of Mr Pytlarz's accusers was a former employee of Sir Paul McCartney (pictured here with wife Nancy) who alleged the masseur touched her intimately during an appointment

After the death of his parents in 
2006, Mr Pytlarz settled permanently in London, where Miss Nowozeniuk 
joined him after completing her degree.

In 2008 they bought the Violet 
Clinic spa and built up a client list of around 800.

After they married in 2010, Mr Pytlarz said: ‘I love Urszula so much, I would give her my life, everything.’

Support: Miss Nowozeniuk leaving Southwark Crown Court during the trial, which she attended every day after giving evidence defending her husband

It  was described as the ‘Groundhog  Day’ trial. The evidence given against Daniel Pytlarz by 18 women was so similar that the case was likened to the Hollywood movie in which a man lives the same day over and over again.

But the same could also be said of the string of happy female clients who queued up to speak in the masseur’s favour at Southwark Crown Court, eventually leading to him being cleared yesterday.

Many of the women who appeared for the prosecution were middle-class professionals who had paid only £26 for their treatments thanks to a cut-price website voucher which offered ‘a unique massage combining ancient and modern techniques’ at his clinic.

A treat that would usually cost £110 promised that Mr Pytlarz would leave them ‘relaxed, rejuvenated, full of life and raring to go’.

But the women would go on to claim at the trial that the relaxing massages had a sinister undertone.

One, who bought the massage for herself and a friend as a birthday treat, claimed Mr Pytlarz went too far and told the court: ‘I felt a kind of shock that this was happening. It was just wrong. I was petrified.’ She added: ‘I just felt I should get out of there as quickly as possible.’

A 17-year-old girl, whose mother had bought her a massage voucher as a birthday gift, said she was left ‘really confused’ after an all-over body scrub.

Another patient, a married businesswoman in her fifties, said she could hardly believe the masseur would be ‘interested’ in her because had a ‘beautiful’ young  wife upstairs.

But Eleanor Laws, QC, defending, claimed that at least five of the 18 witnesses had given accounts that had ‘grown with the telling’. She argued the evidence given in court by those women was different from the accounts they had originally given to the police.

Others had not reported any form of  sexual assault until they were contacted  by detectives investigating Mr Pytlarz,  she said.

‘This is a man who has worked extremely hard, and the two things that mattered most to him were his wife and getting on in his work,’ she said.

An opinion which yesterday the jurors were more than happy to accept.
