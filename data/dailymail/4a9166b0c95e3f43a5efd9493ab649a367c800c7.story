Almost 4,000 NHS staff given redundancy pay-offs as part of the coalition’s health shake-up have been rehired, new figures reveal.

More than one in six managers and administrators given payouts worth as much as £650,000 are now back working in the health service.

Labour accused the government of 'handing out cheques like confetti to people who have now been rehired' at a time when the health service is having to find billions in efficiency savings.

The revelation will pile pressure on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt over the handling of the NHS reforms which he inherited from predecessor Andrew Lansley

Under the controversial shake-up of health trusts, 21,100 staff were made redundant. Ministers boast the changes have freed up money for patient care.

But new figures released in Parliament show that since May 2010, 2,570 people made redundant have been rehired in permanent jobs in the health service. A further 1,380 have been taken back on fixed term contracts.

Under NHS rules staff must only wait four weeks after taking redundancy before they can move to a new job.

However Sir David Nicholson, chief executive of NHS England, has asked managers to wait six months at least.

Andy Burnham, Labour's shadow health secretary, said: ‘It will be utterly galling for nurses who’ve just had a pay cut from David Cameron to see he’s been handing out cheques like confetti to people who have now been rehired.

‘On his watch, we have seen pay-offs for managers and pay cuts for nurses.

‘Cameron's top-down re-organisation has wasted £3 billion and left the NHS in a weak financial position. Nurses are paying the price for his mismanagement of the NHS.’

The number of NHS staff rehired has risen by almost 8,000 since December, with many more expected to return in the coming months.

Mr Burnham added: ‘It’s clear that people who received pay-offs are now coming back to the NHS in ever greater numbers.

‘We need to know whether the Prime Minister has honoured his promise to recover redundancy payments from people who have been re-employed by his new organisations.’

But a Conservative health spokesman said: 'This is sheer hypocrisy from Labour – this Government's hands were tied by unacceptably lax rules on redundancy which they put into contracts in 2006, and which we’re reforming.

'We are working on tough new plans to cap redundancy pay-outs for senior managers and claw back all or part of the payment if they return to work for the NHS within a year of being made redundant.

'Since the election we now have 15,000 more clinical staff and 21,000 fewer administrative posts. Taxpayers want to reduce bureaucracy and increase frontline care staff - that is what we will continue to deliver.'

According to earlier figures, some 2,534 people handed payouts were back working in the NHS within a year, including 403 who were rehired that same month.

Health minister Dr Dan Poulter said: ‘By reducing managers and administrators by over 21,100, we are freeing up extra resources for patient care - £5.5 billion in this Parliament and £1.5 billion every year thereafter.’

Non-clinical staff have received average pay-offs of £43,000 but 2,300 received six-figure deals.

They include a husband-and-wife team of NHS managers who walked away with £1million in combined redundancies straight into six-figure salary posts.

Karen Straughair, 50, pocketed more than £605,000 when NHS South of Tyne and Wear, where she was chief executive, was wound up at the end of March.

Her husband Chris Reed, chief executive of NHS North of Tyne, was paid more than £345,000 when his organisation was abolished.

By June both had board-level jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust – Mr Reed as interim chief executive, Miss Straughair as recovery director.

Another manager, Rob Cooper, received at least £370,000 for losing his role as a deputy chief executive at Yorkshire and the Humber Strategic Health Authority but already had another role lined up at a different health trust.

Steve Spoerry was paid between £335,000 and £340,000, after his job as managing director of Halton and St Helens Primary Care Trust was axed in March.

After taking some interim NHS jobs he is now director of strategy at South and West Yorkshire and Bassetlaw NHS Commissioning Support Unit,

Annette Laban, former chief executive of Doncaster Primary Care Trust, was paid redundancy of £285,000 to £290,000 before taking up a £15,500-a-year part-time role as a non-executive director of Sheffield Teaching Hospitals.
