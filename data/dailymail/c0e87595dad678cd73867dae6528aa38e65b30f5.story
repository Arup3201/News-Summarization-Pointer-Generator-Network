Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins 'would have sex with anyone' and made one 15-year-old 'superfan' dress as a schoolgirl before convincing her to offer up her own baby for abuse, it emerged today.

His former prostitute girlfriend Joanne Majic, 38, says he abused  
hundreds of young fans in this way.

One victim's former boyfriend says the paedophile rock star targeted her when she was underage, using his fame and money to seduce and then 'humiliate her'.

Watkins approached young fans on the band's online forum, before meeting them in hotels and asking to do 'unspeakable things' to them and later their children, he said.

Upset: Miss Majic says the scale of Watkins' abuse is being hidden by fans who were complicit in allowing him attack children and says 'Ian would have sex with anyone' 

Message: Watkins visited ill children at Cardiff's University Heath hospital as part of his charity duties

'Watkins is a modern-day Jimmy Savile, it’s as simple as that,' the scorned boyfriend told Adam Aspinall at the Mirror.

'He used his fame to win impressionable girls over and used his glamour to make them do unspeakable things.

'My girlfriend was about 15 when he found her on a Lostprophets chat forum and started to seduce her.

'She told me he enjoyed making her dress like a little girl and enjoyed ­humiliating her.'

Watkins was described as a 'determined 
and committed paedophile' after he admitted attempting to rape a fan's 
11-month-old baby son along with 10 other child sex offences on Tuesday.

Miss Majic had a two year on-off relationship with the rock star from 2006, but dumped him when he told her his sexual fantasies revolved around child abuse.

The singer, a former boyfriend of BBC presenter Fearne Cotton and model Alexa Chung, also admitted to her he used his Lostprophets fame to turn young girls into ‘Superfans’ willing to allow him to abuse their children.

'I've always said to the police, there's hundreds of victims out there and you're never going to find them because the mothers are in on it,' Miss Majic said.

'Ian would have sex with anyone. He was just incredibly perverted and his appetites just got darker and darker.'

She also says she warned police about the singer's depraved nature four years ago after he told her he wanted to have sex with a child, but says they refused to investigate it.

Menace: Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins face jail for a string of child sex offences, and seduced fans to get to their children, it was claimed today

'I went straight to South Wales Police then and made a complaint but they ignored me and said I needed evidence.

'I warned them this man was a danger to young kids but I think they thought I was just a trouble maker.

'Every time I went to the police he was getting off on the fact that I was made to look an idiot.'

Shocking images emerged last night of paedophile rockstar Ian Watkins visiting sick children in a hospital.

The Lostprophets singer, 36, went to see children at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff as part of his role as 'ambassador for young people' for the Kidney Wales Foundation.

He was even greeted by the then Labour Health Minister Edwina Hart on the visit which was part of a campaign for more people to donate organs. 

Now
 photographs have emerged of the visit showing the paedophile smiling as
 he went to see boys and girls on their sick beds - leading to startling
 comparisons between him and convicted paedophile Jimmy Savile.

At the time these images were taken, Watkins had already undertaken a string of sex offences which would lead to him attempting to rape an 11-month-old baby boy.

Speaking at the time of the hospital visit in 2008, he said: 'I had a great time meeting all the kids at the hospital.

'Lots of the children are waiting for a kidney transplant, but there's a desperate shortage of donors.

'That's why we need more people to join the Organ Donor Register and help savea life one day.'
