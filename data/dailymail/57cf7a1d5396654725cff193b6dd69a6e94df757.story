Nick Vasilaris was the youngest son of Maria and Chris, both 70. He died from brain cancer in May this year, almost two years after being diagnosed

When Nick Vasilaris was diagnosed with brain cancer two years ago he began furiously researching its causes and became convinced he had contracted it through using his mobile phone.

The infectious 40-year-old Gold Coast restaurateur who passed away in May this year became determined to raise awareness about the cancer, which is the biggest single cancer killer of people under the age of 40.

'The doctor believes it was from the phone, [the tumour] was on the left side just above his ear and he was left-handed and on the phone 24 hours a day,' Nick's mother Maria Vasilaris told Daily Mail Australia.

'They can't prove anything like that, so what Nick wanted to do is start the foundation, to raise money for cancer research, give warnings to young people about using their mobile phones.

'It's like smoking, how many years [did it take] them to prove that smoking caused lung cancer? How long for this?'

Nick's idea was to host an event at restaurants across Queensland, including at his own restaurant Café Fresh, called Phone-Free Feast, where people would leave their mobile phones and tablets at home and a portion of their bill would be donated to brain cancer research.

After Nick passed away on May 23 this year his parents, Chris and Maria Vasilaris, as well as the Cure Brain Cancer organisation banded together to make Nick's dream happen.

'He told the doctor “I'll do something about it". He wanted to start the foundation, he got sick and he couldn't do it. We had to carry on that work,' said Mrs Vasilaris.

'He was my baby. His death is very devastating for me and my husband and my two sons… But I'm grateful we're doing [Phone-Free Feast] because he wanted to do it and we're finishing it for him.'

The pilot Phone-Free Feast ran yesterday in 10 restaurants across Queensland and the Cure Brain Cancer organisation will gather information about how successful it is before deciding whether to make the event an annual fundraising and to expand it nationwide.

Beverley Trivett, founder-benefactor of Cure Brain Cancer, told Daily Mail Ausralia that Cure Brain Cancer was not 'in any way intimating that technology is a contributor to brain cancer' saying that numerous studies had shown there is 'absolutely no correlation' between mobile phone usage and brain cancer.

But she said the Phone-Free Feast was a good way of drawing attention to brain cancer, which despite being the biggest single cancer killer of children and having a much lower survival rate than breast cancer or prostate cancer, only attracted three percent of government funding for cancer research and treatment.

The event was also a way of encouraging interpersonal etiquette and dinner conversation, something that was one of Nick's pet peeves, who had seen the prevalence of mobile phone usage by diners at his restaurant.

'When mum and dad go out to dinner what do you do to make the kids shut up? You give them the phone, that's no good. What do you do when you go to dinner with your husband? You talk on your phone, you don't enjoy your food, you don't talk to each other,' said Mrs Vasilaris.

Ms Trivett said that leaving one's phone at home or switiching it off was 'challenging' but the idea behind the fundraiser was 'enjoy the environment, enjoy the food, enjoy your company', an ethos she – and Mrs Vasilaris – think Nick would have approved of.
