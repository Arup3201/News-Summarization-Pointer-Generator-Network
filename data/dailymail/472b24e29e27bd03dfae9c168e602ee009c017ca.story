We’re used to seeing dramatic images of widespread flooding in Britain at the moment - but these photographs could lead us to believe one part of the country has been hit by a drought.

The pictures taken in Sampford Peverell, Devon, show severe soil erosion on a steep field that was said to have contained too few crops prior to the heavy winter rain.

Images of the eroded landscape near Tiverton - with gullies around 5ft deep - were taken yesterday by local photographer Martin Hughes-Jones.

There are five types of topsoil erosion caused by water, but gully erosion is believed to have occurred in this case. This is when water erodes soil to form channels deeper than 1ft.

These gullies start when fast-flowing runoff water hits a ‘nick’ point such as a rabbit burrow, or bare soil - and the water then scours away the soil. It often happens on cleared soils with little vegetation.

It comes as thousands of homes were left without power last night as trains were cancelled and forecasters warned of battering winds and flooding.

The Environment Agency issued three severe flood warnings in the South West. There were 67 flood warnings and 213 flood alerts also in place.

The bad weather continued hours after the Prince of Wales said the ‘tragedy’ on the flood-hit Somerset Levels was that ‘nothing happened for so long’.

The Somerset Levels suffered ‘once in 100 years’ flooding in July 2012, but has endured even worse conditions from December 2013.

More than 128,000 acres have been deluged - at a huge cost to local farmers - with around 40 homes under water and 200 more cut off.
