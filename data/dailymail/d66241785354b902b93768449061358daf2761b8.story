Last week Neil Lennon took the biggest gamble of his footballing career. After talks with chief executive Peter Lawwell he made the decision to bring a tempestuous four year reign as manager of Celtic to an end.

Following further discussions with major shareholder Dermot Desmond at the beginning of this week the matter is settled. As Sportsmail first revealed on Thursday Lennon’s tenure as Parkhead manager is now over.

To many his departure will come as no great surprise. That he appears to be leaving without a job to go to most certainly is.

Taking a risk: Neil Lennon's decision to leave Celtic without a club to join is a gamble

No surprise: Lennon's departure from Celtic Park didn't come as a shock

Linked for weeks with Norwich City the Carrow Road hotseat is now Malky Mackay’ s to turn down. Brighton and West Brom are also in the market for a manager, but so far Lennon has barely rated a mention for either. Quitting a huge and relatively secure job, then, is a hell of a step.

For some time it was speculated he might leave. On messageboards fans have already moved on from discussing the merits of the current coach to debating the pros and cons of potential successors. As player, captain, coach and manager the bond between Lennon and the Celtic support has been strong.

But with Champions League qualifiers around the corner the Scottish champions have players to sign and planning to do. And they could no neither so long as the manager had no idea if he was coming or going. For some time now the matter has been coming to a head.

It’s remarkable to think now that in the first 100 years of their existence, Celtic had just six managers. Willie Maley was dragged out of office kicking and screaming after 43 years. Jimmy McGrory lasted two full decades despite a marked lack of success. Jock Stein’s remarkable era ran from 1965 to 1978.

But football management is now a very different business. Martin O’Neill and Gordon Strachan were successful at Celtic, but the Irishman stayed just five years and Strachan four. Lennon could probably have done another 12 months and become only the third manager in the club’s history to win four-in-a-row. The longest serving Celtic manager since Stein, indeed.

But the trick of a successful managerial legacy in Glasgow is knowing when to quit. An Old Firm manager now has a finite shelf life.

‘Four years at Rangers takes a lot out of you,’ Dick Advocaat once said. ‘Every game has to be won. A draw is no good and that is hard for a manager.

‘The expectations are so high. If you can manage Rangers and Celtic you can manage any team in the world.’ 

The final part of that statement will now be put to the test. People will watch with fascination to see where Lennon surfaces in England, where the average managerial lifespan is 15 months.

Norwich City - for now - is still vacant. And his resignation from Celtic makes it easier to have a conversations with Carrow Road chief David McNally.

But Malky Mackay was interviewed by the Norwich board last Thursday and has been offered the job.

The former Celtic manager is in no hurry to commit himself one way or the other. Partly because the Parkhead post is just one of the alternatives which could now open up.

For Celtic fans it’s difficult to fathom why Lennon would sacrifice another crack at the Champions League for life at a smaller English club.

The explanation lies in the £64million the Canaries will receive for relegation from the Premiership this season.

Last summer Norwich spent big on Gary Hooper. Celtic, in contrast, were only too happy to take the £5.2million.

Lennon was subsequently asked to reach the Champions League group stages despite losing his star striker, Victor Wanyama and Kelvin Wilson. This summer he could be asked to do the same again without Fraser Forster and Virgil van Dijk. All while trying to bed in unproven, £1.5million signings.

This is now the Celtic model. By and large it works well.

They buy young, sell for a big profit and start the process all over again. Lennon knew this when he accepted the job as manager four years ago. But reaching the Champions League - let alone the last 16 - is becoming more and more difficult.

He has asked the Parkhead board to release more funds for a Champions League striker. But Celtic now have a system they like. The days of £6million signings have gone.

After three titles, two Scottish Cups and a memorable run to the last 16 of the Champions League, then, Lennon has reached a bold, gutsy decision.

He has been linked with a raft of high profile jobs in England. But firm offers have never arrived.

That may more of a reflection on English views of the SPFL than on the 42-year-old’s managerial abilities.

When Gordon Strachan left Parkhead the best he was offered was a brief, unfulfilling spell with Championship Middlesbrough. And that was after winning three titles against a strong Rangers.

Down south they believe Lennon has had it easy in comparison. Yet off the field it has been anything but.

Live ammunition through the post. A touchline assault at Tynecastle. Assaults in Glasgow’s west end. Abuse at traffic lights. Hassle at a cup semi-final between Aberdeen and St Johnstone.

One day soon the Lennon family will find themselves in Norfolk or another civilised posting in England.

They will go to cafes and no one will point fingers. They will go to the seaside, walk freely and fill up the tank in a forecourt on the way home. And, for the first time in years, they won’t be looking over their shoulders as they go. Or have a six foot six bodyguard on speed-dial.

Leaving Celtic and Glasgow will be a wrench. Lennon’s partner and son are from the west of Scotland. They have known nothing other than intense, relentless scrutiny. But managing Celtic is no job for a man with his heart in the right place and his head elsewhere.

On his fourth anniversary Lennon touched on some of the strains and stresses of his first managerial post.

'The job has become more difficult because you’re under so much analysis – and social media has really gone into overdrive.

'Your personality traits, your tactics – everything is discussed to the nth degree. People out there in cyberworld analyse you to death.'

They’ll be at it again in the coming days. Asking why he quit. Wondering where he is off to. If truth be told, we all will.
