The daughter of a Conservative politician who was murdered in the Brighton bombing 30 years ago has said she is friends with her father's killer.

Sir Anthony Berry MP was one of five people who died when the IRA explosion ripped through the Grand Hotel on October 12, 1984.

His daughter Jo now travels the world promoting peace and reconciliation with Patrick Magee - the republican bomber who planted the deadly device.

'I would say he is a friend,' she said. 'It is an unusual friendship but I care about him.'

Although reluctant to say she has forgiven Magee for causing her father's death, Ms Berry claimed she understood why he turned to violence three decades ago.

She added: 'I don't like to use the word (forgiveness). For me it is more about empathy and understanding. And the empathy is about understanding from his perspective why he did it.

'I am always going to be against any violence but if I understand why he, and others, chose to use violence then that can help me to look at how we can make the world a place where people are less likely to use violence.

'Forgiveness is such a difficult word. But he is my friend now. We spend a lot of time together.' 

Thirty people were injured in the attack on the eve of the Conservative Party conference but the terrorists' main target, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, escaped relatively unscathed.

At the time of the bombing, Ms Berry, now 57, was a 27-year-old meditation student who had sympathised with the IRA hunger strikers' pursuit for political status in the Maze prison.

She was about to jet off to Africa when the harrowing news of the bomb filtered through.

'It was a massive shock and we had a long, long wait before we eventually got the news in the afternoon that they had found my dad's body and that my step-mother was injured,' she said.

'I didn't just lose my father in that bomb -- someone I had become really close to -- I lost a part of me and I felt very strongly that I was now part of the conflict in Northern Ireland.' 

Magee was given eight life sentences in 1986 but was released under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement in 1999 after serving just 13 years.

Fellow IRA members Gerard McDonnell, Peter Sherry, Martina Anderson and Ella O'Dwyer were also sentenced to life for conspiracy to cause explosions.

They were also released under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.   

A year after Magee's release, Ms Berry, who had deliberately stayed away from the court proceedings and distanced herself from media coverage, met him at a friend's house in Dublin.

She did not tell her siblings about meeting which marked the beginning of a 'miraculous' journey. 

Since that first meeting, they have met to share a platform on non-violence more than 100 times.

She said: 'It was very much 'we' talking rather than 'I'. He was talking for the group - for the IRA, or for Sinn Fein - rather than himself. But, I was very curious about what was beneath that.

'I didn't go into the meeting wanting to argue with him or prove points. It was really to listen and understand.

'He was disarmed by my giving him empathy and there was a second part of the conversation where he had taken off his political hat and was speaking much more as a human being.'

Ms Berry, who now runs the Building Bridges for Peace charity, decided within two days of her father's death to extract something positive from the tragedy.  

In the past 13 years, the reconciliation talks have taken her and Magee to places like Palestine, the Balkans, Rwanda and Colombia.

Ms Berry believes her father would have approved of her actions.

She said: 'I hope he would have understood and given me his support. I think he would have. I am not a politician but, in my own way I think he'd understand that I am trying to change things.

'I never thought I would be planning two events in Brighton on the 30th anniversary with Patrick Magee.

The pair will be taking part in a panel discussion at The Old Market in Hove to mark the 30th anniversary of the explosion.

Ms Berry said it was important Magee attended.

She said: 'For me, inviting Pat to be there on Sunday is to show a living example of reconciliation and the power of empathy. It is really important to have him there to demonstrate that.

'Yes, some people will be upset but, I think, that for peace sometimes you have to take these risks.'

Magee has declined to give press interviews ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Brighton bombing.

Ms Berry believes he has changed considerably.

She added: 'When he planted the bomb he wasn't seeing human beings. It was a strategy and now he sees human beings and wonderful human beings. It has been about him getting his humanity back. That has changed him, definitely.

'He regards me as a friend. He knows that my dad was a wonderful human being and he knows that some of the qualities I have came from my father and that weighs heavily on him.'

How the Daily Mail reported the attack on October 13

It is 30 years since the Brighton bomb ripped through The Grand Hotel killing five people and seriously injuring 34 others.

As well as Sir Anthony Berry, Eric Taylor, 54, chairman of the Conservative party's north west area, Anne Wakeham, 45, wife of the government chief whip, Jeanne Shattock, 52, wife of the chairman of the party's western area, and Muriel McLean, 54, wife of the Chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, were killed.  

The intended target of the IRA terrorist attack was Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Tory Cabinet, who were staying at the hotel during the Conservative Party conference.

But while Mrs Thatcher and her husband Denis narrowly escaped injury, others who were caught up in the explosion at 2.53am on October 12 1984 were not so fortunate.

Former Tory minister Lord Tebbit, the then trade and industry secretary, was severely injured in the blast and his wife Margaret was left paralysed from the neck down and needing 24-hour care.

'I think about it every day in the sense that I look at my wife who was sentenced to life imprisonment in a wheelchair,' he said.

Fiercely protective of his wife, Lord Tebbit, 83, says the anniversary is 'just another day' as he and Lady Tebbit live with the injuries they sustained in the attack.

He said: 'There is nothing really to celebrate, or mark, it just goes on.'

Age has brought its own problems exacerbating the injuries he and his wife suffered, he said.

He said: 'There are only two alternatives. You either live with it or you die with it, and that's the way it is.'

Lord Tebbit also says he has nothing but contempt for bomber Patrick Magee who was handed eight life sentences at the Old Bailey in 1986, with a recommendation he serve a minimum of 35 years.

He was released in 1999 under the Good Friday Agreement - having served 13 years for the crime.

Lord Tebbit said: 'Magee is just a low creature and an object of contempt, particularly as he now tries to make something of a living out of talking about it.

'He was no more than a monkey on an organ grinder's organ.'

Magee will be in the city on Sunday taking part in a panel discussion following a screening of documentary Beyond Right & Wrong at The Old Market in Hove.

The programme follows the story of Jo Berry, whose father Sir Anthony Berry was killed in the explosion, and her reconciliatory journey with Magee.

The Grand will also be marking the anniversary with a minute's silence at noon on Sunday.

Staff at the hotel will gather around a plaque in the lobby which was unveiled by Lord Tebbit on the 25th anniversary of the bombing.

The flag on the roof of the hotel will be flown at half mast for the whole day and the flags on the front of the building will be taken down as a mark of respect to all those who lost their lives and were injured during the bombing.

General manager Andrew Mosley said: 'It is an opportunity to remind the staff and ourselves of what happened 30 years ago on that day.

'To reflect on what it must have been like for our colleagues at the time and to remember those who lost their lives, those who were injured, the community in Brighton that was so badly affected, and members of the emergency services who were called to the blast.

'The message we want to send above all else is that we have not forgotten what happened here 30 years ago.'
