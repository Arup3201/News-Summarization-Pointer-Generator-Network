Nervous about flying? There's an app for that.  

A new app, called 'Am I Going Down?', calculates a plane's chances of crashing in an effort to put apprehensive passengers at ease.

Created by London-based Vanilla Pixel, the app uses real flight statistics to analyse flight safety.

A new app, called 'Am I Going Down?', shows just how unlikely it is that your plane will crash

If you're flying on a Boeing 777 Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong to Los Angeles, there's a one in 4,068,434 chance that your flight will go down en route.

And even the most avid flyers have little to fear.

According to the app, if you take a flight every day for the next 11,146 years, you are unlikely to experience even one incident.

Developer Nic Johns spoke to MailOnline Travel about the app, explaining that it's meant to calm the fears of those who are uneasy when it comes to air travel.

Developed by London-based Nic Johns, the app was initially created to allay the fears of nervous flyers

'The original inspiration for Am I Going Down? comes from my wife (and co-founder of Vanilla Pixel), Julie,' he wrote in an email.

'Her fear of flying has always made travelling difficult, so I wanted to make an app that demonstrates - after entering airline, aircraft and flight details - that flying is in fact extremely safe. 

'As a typical example, flying on a British Airways 747-400 from London to New York has a one in nine million chance of crashing... not quite as long odds as winning the National Lottery, but not far off.'

More than 10 million routes have been assessed, using data from such sources as the Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives, the United States National Transportation Safety Board and the Civil Aviation Organisation.

'For my analysis, I only include crashes where there was at least one passenger fatality - which is the relevant stat for those with a fear of flying,' Johns explained to CNN.

'I then incorporate the volume of flights, weighted to the most recent, to provide the final "one in a million" statistics.'

Users can select their plane, their destination and their departure information for a personalised analysis

Mr Johns has not included AirAsia on the list of airlines, in sensitivity to the recent tragedy

The release of the app, however, did come at a rather awkward time - just days after AirAsia flight QZ8501 went down.

'Admittedly, the timing of the release was unfortunate. I originally developed the app in February 2014, shortly before the first Air Malaysia crash,' he told MailOnline Travel.

'That crash caused me to rethink, so I put the app on hold to work on a few other things. 

'I sent the final app to Apple for review in December, just two weeks before the AirAsia QZ8501 crash.'

In response to the tragedy, Johns has temporarily removed AirAsia from the airline list, explaining that it will return in a later update. 

'Despite all that, the reaction has been extremely positive so far - especially from those with a fear of flying,' he added. 

The 'Am I Going Down?' app is now available on iTunes and is currently only available for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.

An Android version may be released in the future.
