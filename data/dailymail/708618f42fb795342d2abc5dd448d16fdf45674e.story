Marks and Spencer has admitted exposing one of its workers to asbestos, which led to her developing a terminal lung cancer.

Janice Allen, 53, worked in the flagship store on Oxford Street in the 1970s and 1980s. Last year she was diagnosed with mesothelioma, an incurable cancer linked to inhaling asbestos.

Mrs Allen, who has been given just months to live, says she feels betrayed and that the store 'ruined her life' by exposing her to the deadly chemical.

Asbestos which was used in a huge number of buildings between the 1950s and 1970s, but was outlawed after its links to deadly illnesses became clear.

Marks and Spencer admitted negligently exposing Mrs Allen to the substance while she worked at the Oxford Street store and another outlet in Uxbridge, West London.

After admitting liability at the High Court in London, Marks and Spencer agreed to pay 'significant' damages, and agreed an undisclosed figure with Mrs Allen outside of court.

After the settlement, Mrs Allen, whose husband Stuart also worked for Marks and Spencer, said the company 'betrayed' her.

She said: 'I wish that I hard never worked for Marks and Spencer at all , that I had never known them.When I worked for them I was proud to work for them - I was in the premier store.

'Now I wish that I'd never, ever worked for them because they've ruined my life.

'I felt betrayed, really. I worked hard for them... I can't explain how angry it made me feel that they had such disregard for the safety of their staff.'

The case is thought to be the first victory for a Marks and Spencer employee who only ever worked on the shop floor, as opposed to staff such as builders and electricians who had direct contact.

Her case is thought to be the first 
in which judgment has been 
given in court for a Marks and Spencer employee who was exposed to 
asbestos by simply working on the shop floor, as opposed to industrial 
contractors or electricians who came into direct contact with the 
substance.

Leigh Day, the 
law firm which acted for Mrs Allen, has voiced concerns that many more 
workers could have contracted the deadly cancer through their working 
life.

Mesothelioma is a cancer of membrane cells which line major organs. It occurs most often in tissue around the lungs.

Symptoms of the disease include acute chest pains, such as Mrs Allen suffered, a persistent cough and difficulty breathing, high temperatures and weight loss.

More than 2,500 people are diagnosed with mesothelioma every year, with five times more men than women falling victim.

According to the NHS, the disease is 'almost always' caused by asbestos, and takes 20 to 60 years to develop after the initial exposure.

The cancer can be difficult to diagnose accurately, as affected cells do not look distinctive.

Chemotherapy is the main treatment. Some surgical procedures are being investigated, but remain unproven.

Because mesothelioma is so difficult to diagnose, it is often terminal by the time doctors notice. Patients rarely survive more than three years after diagnosis. The average is 12 months.

Some 2,300 per year die of the disease, though experts expect this to increase as more workers exposed to asbestos in past decades are affected.

By 2050, it is thought the cancer will have taken 90,000 lives.

Harminder Bains, a solicitor at Leigh Day, said: 'It can take as long as 40 years for exposure to asbestos to manifest in those who have inhaled asbestos'.

The
 case was aided by evidence from William Wallace, a Health and Safety 
Officer who had informed the HSE of the criminally unsafe work with 
asbestos at Marks and Spencer’s Reading branch, as a result of which the company was fined £1million.

Mr Wallace also worked at the Marble Arch store in 1998, and acted as a witness in Allen's legal claim.

He told the High Court: 'There
 were minefields – asbestos minefields, for want of a better expression.
 You could not have guaranteed the safety of anybody – the workers, the 
staff, the customers. You could not have given a 100 per cent guarantee 
that those people were safe'.

A Marks and Spencer spokesman claimed the company could not comment on individual cases, but extended 'deepest sympathies' to Mrs Allen. She also insisted that its stores are no longer dangerous.

The spokesman said: 'This is an historic case and relates to times of exposure that pre-date the banning of asbestos, when the consequences of its everyday use were still unknown.

'We had very clear policies in place that were the best they could be based on the knowledge of the time - but like other retailers and organisations with a large property portfolio dating back to the post war era, M&S will be subject to asbestos claims.

'We are confident that we now have the most rigorous policy we can have in place and that M&S stores are safe for our employees and our customers.'
