Read Martin Samuel's match report from the Etihad 

Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany hailed 'special' Sergio Aguero as a player who can make the impossible possible following the Argentina striker's stunning Champions League hat-trick in a 3-2 win against Bayern Munich.

City looked on course to suffer another European body blow after goals from Xabi Alonso and Robert Lewandowski saw Bayern overturn Aguero's penalty and give the Bundesliga side a 2-1 half-time lead.

Bayern, despite losing Mehdi Benatia to a red card in the 20th minute, maintained that advantage until five minutes from time but then Aguero sensationally snatched all three points for City with two goals - the winner coming in stoppage time.

The hat-trick continued Aguero's superb goalscoring form for City this season and Kompany admitted they were fortunate to have the 26-year-old in their ranks.

He told ITV: 'If you want to succeed at anything, you need a special player in a special form, otherwise you just don't win anything.

'He's our special player and when he's in that form he makes things achievable that otherwise wouldn't be.'

Aguero added: 'I'm very happy for us, the three points are very important. It was difficult but we are happy because this game was very important. It was a game we had to win.'

Manager Manuel Pellegrini also lauded City's hat-trick hero, but had praise for the rest of his team as well.

He said: 'I think that all the big teams need big players and Sergio is a big player, a top player, and he's very important.

'But I think the whole team continued playing with trust until the end today.

'The two goals that Bayern scored were unbelievable, but the whole team continued having trust in our work and our play until the end.'

The result leaves City level on five points with Roma and CSKA Moscow in Group E as they look to join already-qualified Bayern in the last 16.

On his side's chances, Pellegrini said: 'We're always feeling positive, but it doesn't just depend on what we can do.

'We must try to have our chance until the end and the best way to have a chance is to try and beat Roma.'
