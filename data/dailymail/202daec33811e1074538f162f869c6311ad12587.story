A British man killed in a suicide bomb attack in Afghanistan today has been named by the Foreign Office.

Mark Duffus was one of at least seven people who died in the blast at a Nato supplier's compound in Kabul.

According to BBC News, Mr Duffus was a 41-year-old security contractor from Forres in Moray, north Scotland. He was one of five security guards killed early this morning.

Injured: A wounded man is led to safety while smoke from a bomb blast at a Nato compound in Kabul billows into the air. This morning's explosion killed at least seven people

Bloodied: This man was injured when a suicide bomber detonated a car bomb at the base early this morning and insurgents fought a gun fight with guards

Aftermath: Afghan security guards assess the damage at the base of the logistics company which supplies weapons to Nato. The blast is said to have left a huge crater at the base entrance

Two
truck drivers waiting to enter the compound were also killed with the 
bomber, according to Mohammad Ayoub Salangi, the head of Kabul 
provincial police.

The bomber drove a small truck to the logistics centre - which is used to supply Nato troops - and detonated the explosives.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national in Afghanistan today.

'We are providing consular assistance to his family at this difficult time.'

The blast happened in the Afghan capital at around 4.30am at the base of a 
logistics firm which supplies Nato forces with weapons in Afghanistan.

Four gunmen then stormed into the breach and battled with security guards and an Afghan police special response team for about an hour. The attackers were all killed, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.

Kabul provincial police chief Mohammad
Ayuob Salangi said the powerful bomb left a deep crater at the first 
gate leading into the camp.

Injured: A wounded man, thought to be a security guard at the base, is led bleeding from the site of the explosion

Devastating: An injured man is led away from the blast scene for medical treatment earlier today

Deadly blast: Afghan policeman stand guard at the site of this morning's suicide attack in Kabul. The Taliban has since claimed responsibility

The
attack happened after the Afghan Interior Ministry announced that 
insurgents had killed nearly 300 Afghan local and national police in one
month, illustrating how casualties among local forces are mounting now 
that Nato-led coalition troops have handed over responsibility for 
combat operations.

Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said 
299 police were killed in the last month, and another 618 were wounded. 
The Defence Ministry said it did not have monthly figures for the number
of Afghan soldiers killed.

In
the same time span, Mr Sediqqi said 753 militants were killed in joint 
operations with the military and others, and more than 300 were 
arrested. Another 180 civilians were also killed.

On guard: Afghan police secure the scene after the attack which is said to have happened at around 4.30am local time

Danger: More than 800 Afghan security personnel were killed between January and the end of May this year - a sharp increase as coalition forces begin to pull out of the country

Associated
Press reports that 807 Afghan security force personnel have been killed
along with 365 civilians up until the end of May. More than 60 
coalition troops also died.

That figure compares with an estimated 365 Afghan police and soldiers, 338 civilians and 177 coalition troops during the same period last year.

A regional police commander and three officers were also killed yesterday morning after a roadside bomb exploded in northern Afghanistan.

Baghlan provincial police spokesman Jaweed Basharat said district commander Habinul Rahman was killed when the bomb exploded next to his vehicle while on patrol.

In the western province of Badghis, 12 Taliban militants were killed in two days of fighting at three border security posts, provincial governor's spokesman Mirwas Mirzakwal said.

Three policemen were wounded.
