A young female teacher who began an affair with a sixth-former at one of Britain’s top boarding schools has been banned from the classroom for life.

Ruth Vaughan, who was 24 at the time, first kissed the pupil and exchanged phone numbers with him in June 2013 during his leavers’ ball at the £30,000-a-year Oakham School in Rutland.

Although she did not teach the boy, she got to know him when she helped with the co-ed school’s cadet force, a professional conduct panel hearing was told. The sixth-former – named only as ‘Student A’ – claimed he began a sexual relationship with Miss Vaughan in July 2013.

However Miss Vaughan, a newly qualified design and technology teacher who started at the school in September 2012, insisted that she did not have sex with Student A until his second week of university.

Miss Vaughan, who gave evidence to the hearing via videolink from Saudi Arabia where she now lives, accepted that the relationship was inappropriate even though the teenager had left the school, and expressed regret at her actions.

She was found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct and banned indefinitely from teaching in any school, sixth-form college, youth accommodation or children’s home in England.

Alan Meyrick, who chaired the hearing in Coventry, said: ‘The panel considered that the relationship with Student A was borne out of the position of trust that Miss Vaughan was in as a teacher in Student A’s school – despite him having recently left.’

He added: ‘Miss Vaughan’s obligations would not have changed overnight. This was indicated by the school policy preventing social media interactions with former pupils until September 1 after the pupil left the school.

‘If such interaction was prevented, it is apparent that a relationship would also have been a serious breach of the school’s policies, practices and ethos.’

The hearing was also told that Miss Vaughan bought two other underage Oakham students alcoholic drinks in a pub. 

But the panel did not consider the action to be blameworthy, as she was unaware that they were under the age of 18.

Mr Meyrick went on to say: ‘There was no indication that Student A was vulnerable.’ But he added: ‘I am satisfied that the conduct of Miss Vaughan fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession.’

Work: Vaughan was a design and technology teacher at Oakham School, a £30,000-a-year boarding school

One of the most distinguished schools in the country, Oakham has a long and noble history.

It was founded by Archdeacon Robert Johnson in 1584, and later became the first public school to go online in 1995.

The school - whose Latin motto in English means 'And, like runners, they pass on the torch of life' - has a proud history of sporting sucess.

Notable former pupils in the world of cricket include England's Stuart Broad and former national team captain Percy Chapman, who skippered the team between 1926 and 1931.

The school has also produced several rugby union stars such as former England player Lewis Moody, current national player Tom Croft, Gloucester's Rob Cook and Leicester Tigers' Matt Smith.

Crista Cullen, who was part of Team GB's bronze-winning hockey team at the London 2012 Olympic Games, also attended the school. 

Other noted former pupils in the world of showbiz and entertainment include Jamiroquai frontman Jay Kay, comedian Miles Jupp and actor Matthew Macfadyen.
