His approval ratings are at an all time low, and there is no getting away from it for the President.

An Oregon basketball crowd greeted Barack Obama and the first family with boos last night as they watched Oregon State take on the University of Maryland.

It's a yearly ritual for the Obama family to 
watch the Oregon State Beavers play a Washington-area team because Michelle's brother Craig Robinson coaches the men's team.

And while some fans cheered for the 
President as he took his seat, the leader of the free world put his 
hands his ears amid competing boos.

His
 approval ratings hit an all-time low last week as the continued 
problems with the health care roll out have forced him to apologize once
 again for his administration's mistakes.

A
 poll by Quinnipiac University revealed on Tuesday that 54 per cent of 
Americans disapprove of President Obama's job performance while only 39 
per cent approve.

His administration in being besieged by problems overt the implementation of his signature Affordable Care Act.

The healthcare.gov website that is supposed to allow customers to choose the best healthcare plan for them has been beset by technigal glitches and only a tiny number of customers have actually been able to sign up.

In addition, millions have Americans have had their health insurance policies withdrawn because they do not comply with the Act. That contradicts Obama's earlier oft repeated claim that 'If you like you health insurance, you can keep it'.

The President apologised for the problems, saying: 'We fumbled the rollout on this health care law'.But he insisted that the butt-of-jokes website has 'gotten a lot better over the last few weeks' despite problems with 'information technology procurement' that are inherent in the federal government.Adding to the blow, the latest poll broke the results down into gender and age demographics, showing that every such group disapproves of the work the President is doing.

Male and female voters, young and old, rich and poor, all have higher disapproval ratings than approval ratings for the second term president.

'President Obama's job approval rating has fallen to the level of former President George W. Bush at the same period of his Presidency,' Quinnipiac University Polling Institute assistant director Tim Malloy said.

These new figures show that his public perception continues to deteriorate as just two weeks ago he was at an earlier record low, with only 42 per cent approving in an October 30 poll.

At the Comcast Center on Sunday a few students called out to first daughters Malia and Sasha.

White House press secretary Jay Carney had announced the president's plans to take in the game on Friday. Obama is a consummate basketball fan and pick-up game player. 

The school's athletics department urged supporters to get to the arena 'as early as possible' for the 6pm start, due to the checks, sweeps and tests that had to be made by president's security.

'I'm sure there will be Secret 
Service everywhere,' Terrapins forward John Auslander told The Washington Post. 'I'm 
wondering where he's going to be sitting. Maybe courtside?

'It'll be 
pretty cool playing a game and there's President Obama sitting there 
watching,' the Maryland player added.

Mark Turgeon, the Terps coach said 'I don't know what's happening. They don't tell us anything. I think it would be great.

'I think it would be pretty cool for everybody, for their team and for our team. Hopefully it'll make the teams play even harder than they were going to play.'
