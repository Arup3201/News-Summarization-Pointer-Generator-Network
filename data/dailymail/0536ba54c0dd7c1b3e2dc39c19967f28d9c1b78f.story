Developers of a flying car say they're about $80 million closer to giving your morning commute a real lift.

For years, Moller International has been working on a way to make the old science fiction dream of turning tires into turboprops a reality.

Their SkyCar, designed for speeds of over 300 MPH at altitudes as high as 36,000 feet would seat four people and isn't trying to replace commercial air travel.

Nor do they want their vehicle to cater to only the elite hobbyist. As of today, very few people have had the rare pleasure of riding in any iteration of the SkyCar.

Instead, the company intends to bring their 'vertical take off & landing (VTOL) fast, low-cost personal recreational or utility vehicle' to the masses.

Basically, an eye-catching alternative to the earthbound sports car.

Now, according to a Jan. 24 company statement, founder Dr. Paul Moller has persuaded a Southern California firm to offer up the hefty sum to speed his vehicles' path to the marketplace.

The joint venture with Athena Technologies, Inc. of Harbor City 
California, is intended to pair the 30 years of technological experience
 backing Moller with Athena's affordable manufacturing capabilities 
overseas in Chinese facilities.

And the $80 million is just the tip of the iceberg.

The companies are projecting an eventual $480 million investment into several varieties of the car-plane hybrid.

This includes the 'Neuera' vehicle, basically a flying saucer powered by high-velocity fans.

The company's website boasts the Neuera 'can operate up to 10 feet above any surface: land, water, sand, snow, 
swamp or grasslands...combining the capabilities of a boat, hovercraft, ATV, snowmobile or 
other off-road vehicle.'

But don't start shopping around for pilot gear just yet.

Production on the vehicles wouldn't begin until at least 2014 and the agreement between Moller and Athena isn't even yet official.

"The formal agreement is expected to be approved by both parties
within weeks' Dr. Moller, said in a statement.

Moller expects a working test vehicle, however, by the end of 2013.
