Beaten up: Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer has allegedly been assaulted by an 18-year-old in Kentucky

A US marine who received the nation's highest military award for valour is recovering after being attacked by a teenager.

Sgt Dakota Meyer, who received Medal of Honor from President Barack Obama last year, has been recovering after allegedly being attacked in Kentucky.

Police have arrested 18-year-old Kanissa'a Thompson, who has been charged with second-degree assault, in connection with the incident.

Former marine Sgt Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor last September, two years after the young corporal saved 36 lives during a six-hour ambush in Afghanistan.

He is the third living recipient of the award for actions in Iraq or Afghanistan.

Fox News has reported how he was injured in the fight which took place early Sunday at the Red Barn Event Rental, near Colombia, Kentucky, which is used to host events including wedding receptions and class reunions.

He is reported to have told the news channel that he was hit over the head with a bottle and then kicked and beaten while on the ground by a group of up to ten or more people before he woke up in hospital with three staples in his head.

According to reports, Sgt Meyer was injured badly enough to be treated at a local hospital.

A State Police spokesman was also reported as saying the severity of the charge indicates he was seriously injured, a State Police spokesman told the Herald-Leader.

During the 2009 firefight a 21-year-old Sgt Meyer defied orders from his commanders by charging five times in a Humvee into heavy gunfire and provided cover for his team, allowing many to escape likely death.

He killed at least eight Taliban insurgents.

After the medal was approved, President Barack Obama waited to call until Sgt Meyer's lunch break because the then 23-year-old worried about taking a call on the job.

He also made headlines last year when he tried to sue a defense contractor that he said ridiculed his Medal of Honor, called him mentally unstable and suggested he had a drinking problem, thereby costing him a job.

In a defamation lawsuit filed in Texas, Sgt Meyer alleged that his former employer, BAE Systems OASYS Inc. ruined his chances at landing a new job by telling a prospective employer that he was a poor worker during a three-month stint this past spring.

Leaving active duty in May of 2010, Sgt Meyer was hired by BAE in March the following year after working for another defense contractor named Ausgar Technologies that hired veterans to train active-duty service members, according to the Wall Street Journal.

BAE's manager had claimed Sgt Meyer in that time 'was mentally unstable, that Sgt. Meyer was not performing BAE tasks assigned and that he had a problem related to drinking in a social setting,' according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, seeked unspecified damages.

BAE Systems spokesman Brian Roehrkasse 
said the company was grateful to Meyer for his bravery but strongly 
disagreed with his claims.
