Children from the poorest families start primary school almost two years behind academically, Nick Clegg warned today.

The Deputy Prime Minister said the academic gap between toddlers from different backgrounds can impact on them for the rest of their lives.

A £50 million fund is being launched to help boost the academic achievements of nursery schoolchildren from poor families.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, pictured visiting Foresters Primary School in London last week, warned action was needed to stop children falling behind even before they start school

The Early Years Pupil Premium will be aimed at three and four year olds and will be worth around £300 per child.

It is based on the pupil premium which is already paid to primary and secondary schools for each child from a low income family.

Ministers argue the extra cash will improve the quality of childcare in nurseries, so all children starting school at the age of four are at a similar level of academic ability.

Mr Clegg said: 'Every child deserves the chance to fulfil their potential, and this extra funding is a boost to help our youngest children get on in life and succeed.

'Boys and girls from poorer families have often already fallen 19 months behind their better off classmates by the time they hang up their coat on the first day of school.

‘Increasing their chances of success has got to be a top priority.'

Nurseries will be able to decide how to use the money, the Department for Education said.

A consultation is being launched on exactly how the money will be spent. 

Education minister Elizabeth Truss, pictured with London Mayor Boris Johnson, said nursery children should need more help with language and communication skills

Education minister Elizabeth Truss said: 'Children from low income families are already behind their peers in language and communication by the age of five - this is not good enough.

'We expect nurseries will use this money to create more high quality nursery provision led by teachers.

'We know it's a challenge to close the attainment gap later on but with the introduction of the Early Years Pupil Premium we hope it will prevent this gap from emerging in the first place.' 

4Children chief executive Anne Longfield said: 'There is a real opportunity to use the announcement today as a springboard to maximise the impact of the free early years and childcare places for two-year-olds and the early years pupil premium for three and four-year-olds, and direct support to the most vulnerable pre-school children in a coordinated way that makes a real difference. 

'We also think there is a real opportunity for children's centres to be much more involved in delivering this.

'The Early Years Pupil Premium needs to be increased during the next parliament to the same amount per head as a primary school child would be allocated. As we approach the next general election the challenge is for all political parties to set out how they will provide the support we know families need towards making Britain great for children and families.'
