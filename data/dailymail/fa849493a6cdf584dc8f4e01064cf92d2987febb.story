The German national team can have few keener admirers than Gordon Strachan.

When he landed the Scotland job, the 57-year-old selected Joachim Low’s side as the pinnacle of the style of play to which he would aspire. The events of the past month underlined that as a canny choice.

Strachan’s duties as a TV pundit meant he was close to the action in Brazil as the Germans swept all before them to lift a first World Cup in 24 years.

Pondering: Gordon Strachan will have to work out a way to get points off the Germans in qualifying

They conceded just four goals in seven matches, with their 7-1 semi-final demolition of the hosts going down as one of the most extraordinary of all international results.

It just so happens, of course, that Germany’s next competitive match comes against Scotland in the opening Euro 2016 qualifier on September 7.

The trip to Dortmund will be the most daunting test yet of Strachan’s reign. Yet, while his respect for Low’s team is immense, it would be entirely wrong to suggest he is prepared to write off the fixture in any way. The national boss is adamant Scotland will be actively hunting points against the best on the planet.

Nicking a result might just be the difference when it comes to the contest for second place in the group and guaranteed progress to the finals in France.

Big task: They might be world champions but Strachan thinks Scotland can get points from Germany

Idols: Strachan, here promoting tickets for the qualifying games, is a long-term admirer of the world champions

‘When was the last time Germany didn’t qualify for a championship? It just doesn’t happen,’ said Strachan. ‘But these are not free games. They are games where we can pick up points.

‘Over their qualifying campaigns, the Germans have dropped points. They don’t win every game but they somehow qualify for every tournament.

‘We want to be a team that is picking up something from Germany, home and away.’

It is not, therefore, just about turning up in the Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund and looking for a positive performance.

‘No, you always talk about a performance after you get beat,’ insisted Strachan. ‘We want to win. It’s like Brazil — they just wanted to win.’

Quality: Germany can boast arguably the world's greatest goalkeeper in Manuel Neuer

The Germans will play a World Cup Final rematch against Argentina four days before they take on Scotland. Strachan had no intention of accepting a similar friendly as he attempts to get his squad in the best possible shape.

‘I wanted the seven days to prepare for Germany,’ he insisted. ‘I didn’t want to play a friendly where I’d be thinking of resting some players and it wouldn’ t be the team I’d be playing against Germany. The players would know that themselves.

‘Then there would have to be a day of rest after the game and suddenly you’ve only three days to prepare. I thought it would be best to get the seven days with the players. That will help me over the campaign.’

Champions: Andre Schurrle lifts the famous gold trophy in Brazil

This will be the third  successive European Championship qualifying campaign — after meetings with Italy and Spain — in which Scotland have been grouped alongside the reigning world champions.

Strachan feels it is a far tougher path than some nations who made it to Brazil had to travel.

‘I look at some of the teams in the World Cup and see the sections they’ve come from,’ he said. ‘If you look at our last draw (for the World Cup qualifiers), we had Belgium — who went to about top four in the world but who were pot three when the draw was made.

‘Then Serbia, look at their squad and see where those players are playing. Lazar Markovic has just moved to Liverpool for £20million. Everyone plays in the Champions League. Nobody will want Serbia in any draw now, trust me.

Big fan: Strachan frequently spoke out about his admiration of the Germans while working for ITV

‘And you’ve got Croatia who were third in the world at that time. That’s what we had as a qualifying group. I don’t care who you are — if you put those three teams together, you wouldn’t want to be in that group. Even Germany or England wouldn’t want that.’

Asked if he felt Scotland would have held their own at the World Cup, Strachan replied: ‘Aye. We are better than teams who were there. But they had a different way of getting through.’
