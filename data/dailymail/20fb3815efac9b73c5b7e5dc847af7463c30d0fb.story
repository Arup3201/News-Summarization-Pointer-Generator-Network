Job done, move on. England avoided a potential banana skin by running in six tries against a hopelessly underpowered Italian side but will wake up this morning knowing there is much work to do ahead of their visit to Dublin in a fortnight.

Stuart Lancaster made no attempt to mask his disappointment after seeing his side concede three tries — the first inside four minutes when Sergio Parisse bulldozed over and the last just seconds from the end when Luca Morisi brushed past Jonny May — and the England coach acknowledged improvements must be made to claim victory over pre-tournament favourites Ireland.

‘If you had said to me before the game we would get 47 points I would have taken it but there was a soft try first up and a soft try at the end,’ Lancaster said. ‘I was disappointed we didn’t get the same level of intensity throughout the 80 minutes.

‘We want to get out of the habit of giving away a soft try at the start of every game because it comes back and hurts you.’

Lancaster was right to be disappointed. England did plenty of good things in this game, most notably another world-class contribution from Bath’s livewire centre Jonathan Joseph, but they were painfully slow out of the blocks once again while their defence was alarmingly porous at times.

Mercifully, they avoided serious injury but spare a thought for Mike Brown, who will wake up this morning with the sorest head in the team, regardless of how muted the celebrations were, after a sickening early collision with Andrea Masi.

The unconscious England full back required almost 10 minutes of treatment on the ground before being taken from the field on a stretcher after being given oxygen.

He reappeared later on the touchline showing no outward signs of damage, but following hard on the heels of George North’s overlooked double concussion last week, it was the last thing the player, or the sport, needed.

England, forced to keep warm as medics attended their stricken team-mate, were clearly shaken by Brown’s 13th-minute injury — caused as he bravely dived to avert Masi gathering Kelly Haimona’s chip ahead — and it was 21 minutes before George Ford got them on the scoreboard with his first penalty. With England having to come from behind once again, as they did in Cardiff last weekend, Lancaster and his coaching team admitted there was cause for concern.

‘We’re all delighted with the result,’ Lancaster added. ‘We know we’ve made progress but we know to beat Ireland in Ireland we’re going to have to step up again.’

Brown’s exit forced Lancaster to reshuffle his back line and the England coach opted to bring on Billy Twelvetrees and shift Anthony Watson to full back, with Joseph moving to the wing rather than make the straight swap of bringing Danny Cipriani on at full back.

It proved an inspired decision as Twelvetrees resumed his partnership of 12 months ago with Luther Burrell to produce one of his best games in an England shirt.

No 8 Billy Vunipola barged over from a 24th-minute lineout peel and, despite television replays proving inconclusive, the television match official awarded the try and England were finally up and motoring.

Joseph’s first try, courtesy of a superb Chris Robshaw turnover in midfield, saw the Bath flyer skip outside Haimona’s tackle before bamboozling Leonardo Sarto with some darting footwork and electric acceleration to purr in from the halfway line.

It was such a high-class finish, some in the crowd compared it with Jeremy Guscott in his pomp.

‘We assess every player’s performance throughout the season and we’ve scored them on a weekly basis,’ Lancaster added.

‘JJ, of all our centres, has been top- ranked. As the season has gone on his case for inclusion has become overwhelming on his club form.’

Three years after making his debut as a 20-year-old before being told to go away and work on his defence, Joseph, who also scored against Wales last week, has been England’s outstanding player in the first two games.

His second try, 61 minutes in, again demonstrated his keen eye for space and electric pace. He has added another dimension to England’s attacking play.

‘We felt JJ needed to work on his defence and his management of the wide breakdowns,’ Lancaster said.

‘That’s really come on but also his confidence and his presence in the team. He’s shown himself as a real leader in the team. That’s grown on the back of good work at Bath.’

Italy had a chance to claw their way back but two Haimona missed penalties deflated the visitors, who should have been dead and buried by half-time only for Jonny May to bomb a straightforward try when he ignored a two-man overlap after 36 minutes. It could cost the Gloucester wing his place.

After going in 18-5 up, the second half proved more straightforward for England — bar a couple of well taken tries from Morisi — after Ben Youngs scuttled over from a quickly taken tap penalty on 55 minutes.

Joseph’s brilliant second try, after some smart work from Billy Vunipola, Youngs, Twelvetrees and Ford, made it 33-10 before replacement Danny Cipriani — making a welcome return to Twickenham seven years after his last appearance — started and finished a sweeping move down the left.

Fellow replacement Nick Easter finished the try-scoring for the hosts when the 36-year-old became the oldest England try scorer of all time, only for Morisi to leave a sour taste with his late score.

As school reports go, it was a case of could do better. To beat Ireland in two weeks, England will have to.
