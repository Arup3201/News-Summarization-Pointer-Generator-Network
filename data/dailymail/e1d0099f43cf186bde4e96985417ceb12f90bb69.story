It is not only Arsenal struggling for form this term. Click here to read the five things Liverpool can do to infiltrate the top four

On Boxing Day last season, Arsenal were top of the Premier League tree. Twelve wins from their first 18 saw them one point ahead of Manchester City, two in front of Chelsea and three above Liverpool.

This season, it ia a different story entirely. Arsene Wenger's side are 6th in the Premier League after just seven wins from their first 17, a massive 12 points behind Chelsea at the top of the table.

Here, Sportsmail look at the five things Arsenal need to do to right their wrongs, and climb into the top four of the Premier League. 

HANG ON TO A LEAD... 

Arsenal have dropped 11 points from winning positions this season and that suggests either a mental or physical weakness in the team.

Arsene Wenger’s team dropped nine in total last season but there appears to be a soft underbelly this campaign, which could be explained by the rotating injury list but is still not good enough.

The sight of Per Mertesacker ducking at Anfield on Sunday will not have gone down well with either manager or fans.

Laurent Koscielny is a big miss and if Wenger does decide to buy in January, then a central defender has surely to be his first priority.

Kieran Gibbs had his head in his hands at full-time on Sunday after Arsenal squandered another lead to draw

GET WALCOTT BACK ON THE PITCH... 

When Theo Walcott ticks, so do Arsenal. The winger was on the bench at Anfield so he is getting closer. Walcott provides pace, vision, finishing and is a marvellous link-up player.

Imagine if Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Alexis Sanchez all clicked at the same time. There would be sear marks on the pitch. Walcott’s intelligence also means he can adapt his role as required. Welcome back, Theo.

Theo Walcott is back in training, and was on the bench against Liverpool on Sunday

WHAT TO DO WITH WELBECK... 

Danny Welbeck likes to be the main man but the return of Olivier Giroud means he is required out wide where his work-rate is unquestioned but where he struggles to have an influence.

The situation is unlikely to change any time soon with fit-again Giroud back in the goals and only really able to play as a central striker.

So Wenger has to get inside Welbeck’s brain and persuade him that he can utilise his pace or  play two centre forwards, which is about as likely as the manager being made a freeman of Stoke.

The return of Olivier Giroud  means that Danny Welbeck is required in a wide position for Arsenal

SORT OUT CENTRAL MIDFIELD... 

Easily said, far harder done. If Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey, Mikel Arteta and Mesut Ozil are all fit, and Walcott, Santi Cazorla and Oxlade-Chamberlain stay so, Arsenal have an abundance of midfield riches.

But, at the moment, the only ‘proper’ not-injured defensive central midfielder available is Mathieu Flamini, who had a nightmare against Liverpool. The 30-year-old Frenchman is also a disciplinary risk.

Arteta, Ramsey and Wilshere can operate there but they are all occupying the physio room at present. Hurry back, boys.

Arsenal only have Mathieu Flamini fit as a 'proper' defensive midfielder and he is a disciplinary risk

STICK WITH LE BOSS...

Arsenal fans should be careful for what they wish for. Calling for Arsene Wenger’s head, halfway through a season, is not the way to inspire the team to a top-four position.

Even when Arsenal win – The Hawthorns springs to mind – there was a banner asking Wenger to go.

The obvious question is who would replace him? Knee-jerk decisions are not the Arsenal way and the sooner every fan shelves their negative feelings the better it will be for the team.

Arsene Wenger has been criticised by some Arsenal fans, but they need to be careful what they wish for
