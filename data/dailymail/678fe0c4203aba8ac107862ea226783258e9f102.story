SoulCycle may be one of America's most popular workout classes, but it appears one star is decidedly not a fan.

After complaining bitterly about the terrible weather during Tuesday night's episode of Bravo's Watch What Happens Live, host Andy Cohen went off on an abrupt tangent that saw him slamming the indoor cycling studio.

'I hate SoulCycle. If I wanted a lesbian to yell at me I'd go to the Cubbyhole!' he declared, referring to a famous lesbian and gay bar in New York City.

Haters: While talking about the weather on Tuesday night's episode of Bravo's Watch What Happens Live, Andy Cohen went on an abrupt tangent that saw him slamming popular indoor cycling studio SoulCycle

'I hate SoulCycle!' The TV host launched a bitter tirade against the popular spin classes during his show 

And his guest stars Sandra Bernhardt and Brandi Glanville chimed in, too.

'I wouldn't step foot in SoulCycle,' said Sandra, and Brandi agreed. 

'We wouldn't step crotch [in a SoulCycle class, it hurts the kitty cat!' the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills exclaimed, gesturing between her legs.

Andy, who once confessed that he was 'obsessed' with SoulCycle, was prompted to begin his diatribe after introducing his Jackhole of the day: 'white chicks' who push him out of the way on the subway when it's raining.

Thanks to the inclement weather, New York's subway system has been particularly crowded recently - and Andy insists that women on their way to SoulCycle classes are the main source of the problem. 

'I'm sorry I c**k-blocked your warm-up at SoulCycle, white ladies!' he joked.

The studio audience cheered at his reference to the indoor cycling studio, suggesting they all felt the same way.

Meow: Sandra Bernhardt (R) and Brandi Glanville (L) voiced their agreement with Brandi saying that the cycling classes 'hurt the kitty cat'

Spitting with anger: Andy's furious rant about SoulCycle was prompted by his annoyance at the 'white chicks' who barge him out of the way on the subway

Viewers shared their reactions to the comment on Twitter, with one person writing: 'Andy just threw SO MUCH SHADE at soulcycle  #wwhl #hilarious'.

Another fan wrote: 'SoulCycle haters unite,' and a third said: 'Best part of your Jackhole was you hating on SoulCycle!'

The 46-year-old TV personality also bad-mouths the workout in his new book, The Andy Cohen Diaries.

An excerpt reads: 'I met Mark Jason and Lauren at SoulCycle, which I hadn't done in a couple years because I always feel like if I wanted to be screamed at by lesbians, I’d go to the Cubbyhole.

'The same s*** coming out of the mouths of these SoulCycle instructors that made me go nuts years ago did again today - faux inspiration and "depth" spurted out with the passion of a McDonald’s drive-through operator,' he continues.

'I got depressed by the tribes of Lulu Lemmings in a place shallow enough to make this dime-store philosophy meaningful.'

Devoted fans: Although SoulCycle boasts an impressive celebrity following, including the likes of Kaley Cuoco (L) and Kelly Ripa (R), it seems as though the workout's popularity may be dwindling

Wearing it on their sleeve: Jennifer Lawrence (L) and Olivia Wilde (R) have both attended SoulCycle classes in the past while wearing the brand's own line of workout gear

He does put a somewhat positive spin on the experience though, concluding it: 'That being said, I sweated out a bottle of tequila and almost puked twice, so I think the workout was a success.’

While Andy might not be a fan of the classes, they have built up an impressive celebrity following over the years.

Several Victoria's Secret Angels, including Alessandra Ambrosio and Lily Aldridge, have credited the workout with helping them to maintain their supermodel figures, while Kelly Ripa, Kelly Holmes and even Lady Gaga have all previously sung their praises to SoulCycle, which launched in 2006 and charges $32 for a 45-minute group class.

But while it has maintained its cult-like status for the past few years, it seems the reign of SoulCycle may be over.

Indeed, these days many perceive it as a hobby of the 'Basic B****', as exemplified in a holiday gift guide published on Refinery29.

Celebrity favorite: Despite Andy's feelings about the classes, they have managed to amass an impressive following from a wide variety of famous faces

'By day, she's front row in her SoulCycle class. By night, she's swapping out her Liquiteria for margs on the rocks,' reads the article.

'And, by now, we've all heard about the "Basic B****." While some wholeheartedly embrace the term (bros included), others cringe at the thought of being a walking cliché.'

And just last month, SoulCycle faced negative press when lawyer Douglas Wigdor claimed his membership to the studio had been revoked simply because he was representing a former instructor in a case.

The lawsuit stated that SoulCycle's owners Julie Rice and Elizabeth Cutler barred both Mr Wigdor and his client from working out at the facilities just four days after he filed a federal wage theft claim.
