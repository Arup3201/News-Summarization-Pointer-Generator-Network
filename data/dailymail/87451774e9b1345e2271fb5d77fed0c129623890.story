Brazil's World Cup hopes this summer rest on the shoulders of their 22-year-old Barcelona star Neymar. But can he live up to the achievements of the greatest players ever to have worn the shirt of The Selecao.

A new star: Neymar is Brazil's new star - but will make the list of top Brazilians

10: Carlos Alberto (1964-77)

Captain of the best Brazil team of all time and scored the goal that became a trademark for 'The Beautiful Game'

Carlos Alberto was nominally Brazil’s right-back in 1970 but that didn't really matter as the team developed a new style where defenders were as liable to do tricks and score goals as forwards.

Alberto’s overlapping run to shoot in Pele’s pass in the final against Italy has been re-run millions of times around the world ever since. Besides that goal, Carlos Alberto was a popular captain in a team of huge talent and ego. Brazilians feel his exclusion from the 1966 squad was the reason they failed the year that England won it.

9: Ronaldinho (1999-2013)

His perennial toothy grin and array of tricks and flicks brought the joy back to Brazilian football after they’d won the World Cup in 1994 in a more austere manner.

Ronaldinho was the ultimate playboy footballer who enjoyed life on and off the pitch. He exploded on to the scene at the 2002 World Cup having arrived as a relatively unknown with Paris St Germain, who weren’t the major force they are today.

Manager Felipe Scolari gave Ronaldinho freedom and he was the best young player in the tournament. His winner against England from near the touchline was condemned as a fluke by fans here, but in Brazil they remain convinced he meant it. Some would love to have seen him in this year’s World Cup squad even at the age of 34.

Box of tricks: Ronaldinho was a star for Brazil for over a decade 

8: Leonidas (1932-38)

Scored 37 goals in 37 games for Brazil and nicknamed 'The Black Diamond' as the country’s first genuine football superstar.

He brought a new skill to football - the bicycle kick – which earned him another nickname, The Rubber Man. And he was at his peak during the 1938 World Cup, which he top-scored with seven goals.

In fact, if Leonidas had not been injured for the semi-final against eventual winners Italy, Brazil might have claimed their first World Cup then, instead of waiting another 20 years until 1958. Leonidas was small and quick, changing the assumption that you had to be big to succeed and paving the way for future superstars like Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi.

7: Roberto Carlos (1992-2006)

Full-backs are seen as hugely important positions in the modern international game – a status largely down to Roberto Carlos.

Describing the long-time Real Madrid player as a left-back seems strangely insufficient. He was given the freedom to roam forward by Luis Felipe Scolari, who picked two holding midfielders to accommodate him – another trend copied by other managers since.

Roberto Carlos was hugely important to Brazil’s win at the 2002 World Cup. He is also regarded as the most spectacular of Brazilian free-kick takers, quite a claim. His most famous strike came against France at Le Tournoi in 1997, a strike that was heading well past the post until it changed trajectory at the last moment.

Set piece king: Roberto Carlos was a threat from free kicks

6: Jairzinho (1964-82)

Scored in every game of Brazil’s 1970 World Cup triumph including the final – a record that remains unsurpassed.

Jairzinho was the first of the versatile attacking players, possessing the speed and trickery to be an effective winger, and the shooting power and finishing ability to be a centre-forward.

He’d recovered from two broken legs to take his place in the 1970 team and though Pele, Gerson, Tostao and Rivelino dictated matches, he finished the chances. He scored the only goal in a titanic group game against England and the third in Brazil’s 4-1 win in the final against Italy. He played in the 1974 World Cup and such was the respect for him in Brazil, they allowed him  an international send-off at the age of 38 in 1982, against Czechoslovakia.

In the goals: Jairzinho scored in every game in the 1970 World Cup

5: Garrincha (1955-66)

Together with Pele, he helped pave the way for future generations of black players to star in the modern era for Brazil.

Dubbed The Little Bird, Garrincha used a physical abnormality – one leg significantly shorter than the other – to his own huge advantage, giving him a body-swerve other wingers couldn’t emulate.

He was drafted in with Pele at the 1958 World Cup – a breakthrough moment for black footballers – and together they led Brazil to the trophy. Four years later with Pele injured, Garrincha single-handedly helped Brazil retain the cup, becoming the tournament’s joint top-scorer in 1962. He is revered in Brazil where his journey from poverty to superstardom, and problems with womanising and alcoholism, is the stuff of folklore

The little bird: Garrincha helped pave the way for black players in Brazil

4: Romario (1987-2005)

A one-touch finisher par excellence, Romario was responsible for ending Brazil’s long 24-year wait for the World Cup.

The striker, with an extraordinary low centre of gravity, was the heartbeat of the Brazil side that lifted the trophy in 1994. He perfected the toe-poke finish but arguably his most important goal came with his head – the winner in the World Cup semi-final against Sweden.

Unlike his 1970 Brazilian counterparts, Romario played his club football in Europe and was a huge hit with PSV Eindhoven and Barcelona, whose manager Johan Cruyff labelled him ‘a genius’. Scored 55 goals in 70 games for Brazil.

Winner: Romario (lifting the trophy) played a key role in helping Brazil win the World Cup in 1994

3: Ronaldo (1994-2011)

The leading World Cup goalscorer of all-time and possibly the greatest comeback story ever told.

The biggest superstar in the world in 1998, the 21-year-old suffered a mysterious breakdown - some reports suggest it was a convulsive fit - before the World Cup final against France. His name was scrubbed off the team sheet, then reinstated to huge drama, but he looked a shadow of his normal self in a 3-0 defeat for Brazil.

The next four years were wrecked by injuries with cynics doubting he could maintain his blistering pace following a series of knee operations. Instead, he dominated the 2002 World Cup in Japan and scored both goals in the final against Germany to earn Brazil their fifth and most recent World Cup.

One of the best: Ronaldo has been one of the best Brazilians in the modern era

2: Zico (1976-86)

Would probably be considered on a par with Pele had he won the World Cup. Unfortunately, the 1982 side he starred in blew up against Italy and instead gained the reputation as the greatest team never to have been world champions.

Zico is undoubtedly regarded in Brazil as the equal of the other great names in this list who have won the World Cup. As an all-round talent, it is hard to think of anyone his equal; he was the ultimate creative No 10 but also added goals, pace, set-pieces and heading to his game.

He played in three World Cups – Scotland fans will remember Alan Rough’s look of disbelief as his free-kick flew into the ‘postage stamp’ of the goal in 1982 – but infamously missed a penalty against France in the 1986 quarter-final having just come on as substitute.

Missing out: Zico must be one of the best Brazilians never to win the World Cup

1: Pele (1957-71)

Regarded with Diego Maradona as the greatest player of all-time, and with Muhammad Ali the most internationally-recognised sportsman of all-time.

Pele scored more than a thousand goals in his career and is the only player to win three World Cups, starting in 1958 as a 17-year-old. He’s so famous, even the long version of his name Edson Arantes do Nascimento is known to fans around the world.

Icon: Pele is considered to be the best player to play the game

Simply the best: Pele won three World Cups with Brazil in 1958, 1962 and 1970

Due to the 1960s introduction of satellite television and boom in air travel, Pele became football’s first true international superstar as The Beatles were in the entertainment world. He also introduced the United States to soccer with the New York Cosmos.

The 1970 World Cup was his zenith, featuring an attempted shot from the halfway line, his outrageous dummy against Uruguay, the Gordon Banks save and his hug with Bobby Moore that encapsulated sportsmanship.

The Brazilian which all others – Neymar included – have to aspire to.
