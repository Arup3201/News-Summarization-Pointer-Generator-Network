The married son of renowned sex researchers Masters and Johnson has been arrested for pleasuring himself in front of female undercover police officers as they passed by his exclusive summer home in Michigan.

Charged with aggravated indecent exposure, William H. Masters III, 60, was released on $5,000 bail and is facing two years in jail for the incident, which officers say was only the latest in a string of debaucherous deeds in the area.

Female officers, posing as kayakers, were part of a local sting operation investigating the 'indecent' goings on of the posh summer homes in the Pointe aux Barques.

Police told the MailOnline that Masters III was arrested on Saturday near his family's lux vacation cottage. This was his first arrest in the county.

'It’s a very rich, wealthy gated community,' explained a local source to the New York Post, 'with cottages built by families like [tire magnate] Harvey Firestone.'

Masters III was nude on the banks of the Pinnebog River at the Port Crescent State Park Day use area in Hume Township when two female kayakers paddled by.

Officers claim he 'yelled for attention' from his perch on a nearby dune and then proceeded to make 'obscene gestures' at the women when they looked his way.

The boaters, however, were part of a 
'combined law-enforcement-agency sting operation, working out of a 
two-person kayak on the river.'

The
 officers beached their kayak and chased after Masters III, calling for 
backup from a Michigan conservation officer to help in their pursuit.

They eventually collared him and arraigned him on Wednesday for the felony charges.

'This sting operation was prompted by many incidents over the years such as yesterday’s,' Sheriff Kelly J. Hanson said.

Dr
 William H. Masters and Mrs. Virginia E. Johnson were the co-authors of 
the controversial books 'Human Sexual Response' and 'Human Sexual 
Inadequacy'.

Both books were best-sellers and have been translated into 30 languages.

Together they founded an independent not-for-profit research institution
 in 1964, originally called the Reproductive Biology Research Foundation
 and renamed the Masters & Johnson Institute in 1978.

Their work was essential to the study of  sexual dysfunction, sexual disorders and human sexual response.

Among their most high-profile studies, they investigated the nature of female orgasm, specifically the physiology of clitoral and vaginal arousal, as well as the difference between the two, dispelling long standing misconceptions.

'A lot of law enforcement time, effort and resources have been expended over the years on this non-sense. This was not our first operation and will not be our last.'

He added that in the past two weeks alone, there have been four such incidents.

'One thing is for certain, future "free stylists" need to take note that their actions will not be tolerated,' he said.

There have been numerous incidents reported to police over the past five years, but there have only been two arrests so far.

'We are a community of about 31,000 people and we take offense to behavior like this,' Sheriff Hanson said.

Masters III, who divides his time between Manhattan and Southampton, is the son of William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson, who pioneered the study of human arousal and the diagnosis and treatment of sexual disorders and dysfunctions.

They co-authored 
the controversial books 'Human Sexual Response' and 'Human Sexual 
Inadequacy'. Both books were best-sellers and have been translated into 30 languages.

Masters III is a freelance television producer, as is his wife Victoria Baker, who had no comment about the incident.

Showtime is currently in the process of turning his family's forays into an original series called 'Masters of Sex', starring Michael Sheen and Lizzy Caplan.
