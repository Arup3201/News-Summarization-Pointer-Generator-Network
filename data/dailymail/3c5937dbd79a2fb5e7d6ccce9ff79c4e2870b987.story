Kurt Zouma left the field on a stretcher after he was involved in a nasty collision with Petr Cech during Chelsea's Capital One Cup tie at Derby.

The defender was knocked to the floor from a Derby corner and received treatment for seven minutes as the first half drew to a close.

Paramedics were hurried on to the pitch whilst Chelsea's medical team tended to Zouma as concerned team-mates Cesc Fabregas and Cesar Azpilicueta each grabbed the front of the stretcher.

Zouma was said to have had bleeding around his mouth and his neck was in a protective brace as he left the field. Branislav Ivanovic was sent on by Jose Mourinho to replace the defender as the first half concluded.

The young centre back, who did not need to go hospital, will be available for Monday's trip to Stoke  and Mourinho said after the game: ‘He was just a bit dizzy.

'He had some blood in his mouth because of a cut. He went for some exams with the doctors.

‘The players had body language that was easy to understand a bit of trouble. But I had no idea what was wrong. They (the stretcher-carriers) came walking. But after that I was informed this is the direction they have. They can’t run. 

‘The people with the stretcher want to help and if they didn’t run I have to believe that is the instruction they have.’ 

Chelsea's Spanish duo helped paramedics carry the stretcher on to the pitch seemingly in a bid to try to speed things up

Zouma, pictured controlling the ball early in the first-half, joined Jose Mourinho's side from St Etienne in January for £12.5million

Fabregas, who helped paramedics carry the stretcher on to the pitch with fellow Spaniard Azpilicueta, posted a picture of the pair on Instagram and joked: 'Through to the semis. Azpilicueta and I had a double job tonight...'

Zouma, who turned 20 in October, was making his seventh appearance of the season for tChelsea, having played a full 90 minutes against Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League last week.

Big things are expected of the France Under 21 centre half, who joined from St Etienne for a fee of £12.5million in January.

Chelsea won the match 3-1 to progress to the semi-finals, with goals from Eden Hazard, Filipe Luis and Andre Schurrle sealing their progress. 

Craig Bryson had pulled the score back to 2-1 but Jake Buxton's sending off shortly afterwards put paid to any hope of a comeback. 

Fabregas joked he and Azpilicueta had two jobs to do on Tuesday after sharing a photo on Instagram of the pair helping the paramedics
