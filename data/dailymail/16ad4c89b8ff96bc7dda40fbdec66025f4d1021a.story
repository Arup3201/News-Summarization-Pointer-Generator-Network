A news reporter had a bad - and very painful - day at the office when she face planted onto the ice live on television.

M.A. Rosko was ice skating when she was taken aback by strong winds which knocked her off balance.

She desperately tried to stay upright but landed on the ice with a sickening thud.

Minnesota Fox 9 News anchor M.A Rosko had a painful day at the office after falling over during a live report

Rosko spins her arms but cannot regain her balance and trips forward towards the during the live report

She can't stop the fall and lands face-first onto the ice with a sickening thud

The Minnesota Fox 9 anchor was reporting live from the John Rose MN Oval in Roseville, Minnesota, which is one of the largest purpose-built outdoor ice rinks in the U.S.

Rosko's report started well and she seemed genuinely excited when the wind began to push her backwards.

She said: 'It is super nice out his morning. Super windy but warm.

'The wind is blowing such that I am able to skate backwards with absolutely no effort whatsoever.

Rosko muttered 'ok' as she fell and unsurprisingly said 'ow' after smashing her face against the ice

The hilarious video has now been shared many times on YouTube and Twitter

'This is actually kind of amazing. This is actually really unbelievable.'

However, things began to go wrong when a particularly strong gust took her by surprise.

As she span her arms around trying to regain her balance, Rosko could only mutter a quick 'ok' before landing face first on the ice.

The ice rink's Brad Tolberg looked aghast as he watched her fall.

Despite the obvious pain, Rosko immediately gets up and continues with the report

The reporter later tweeted that she had to put a bag of ice on her swollen lip after the accident

Ever the professional, she immediately picked herself up and continued her report on the rink's zamboni production.

Rosko was not visibly injured on camera but her lip did swell up later on. 

She tweeted after the report yesterday; 'I must admit I have an ice bag on my lip... I hope it works!'
