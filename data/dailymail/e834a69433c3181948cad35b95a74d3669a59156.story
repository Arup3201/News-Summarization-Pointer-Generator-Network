It's an art form more commonly associated with female performers thanks to the international profile of stars such as Dita Von Teese.

But at the Caput Mundi International Burlesque Awards held at the weekend, men proved they are equally at home strutting their stuff as burlesque performers.

At the event, held for the second time in Rome, both men and women took to the stage to compete as a panel of judges voted on the best 'international showcase' and best newcomer.

Bending over backwards to impress: The awards were decided by a panel of judges

Helping hand: One performer used a puppet to enhance their act

Vintage performance: Another opted for the more traditional accessory of feather fans

Showcase: The aim of the awards was to 'recover the prestige of the art of burlesque'

Striptease: The event was full of exhibitionists

More than 20 performers from around the world demonstrated their take on the genre. Some opted for a racy strip tease while others played it for laughs with the help of a ventriloquist dummy. 

The Facebook page for the awards states that they were established to 'recover the prestige of the art of burlesque and to create a big burlesque family.'

They added that the performers will be 'sparkling with beauty, glamour, laughs and sauciness' as these pictures from the event illustrate.
