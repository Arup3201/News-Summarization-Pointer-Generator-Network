A British al-Qaeda supergrass told yesterday how Osama Bin Laden gave him a hug and wished him well on his suicide bombing mission.

Gloucester-born Saajid Badat was about to fly to the UK with explosives hidden in his shoes when he met the 9/11 mastermind in Pakistan just two months after the World Trade Centre and Pentagon terror attacks.

'He said the American economy is like a chain, if you strike one link you bring the entire thing down,' Badat told the trial of hook-handed Finsbury Park hate preacher Abu Hamza in New York.

'My understanding was that link was the aviation industry.

'Osama Bin Laden told me religion was central to justify al-Qaeda goals, motions and actions.

'He gave me a hug and wished me well.'

Badat was given a pair of shoes with bombs concealed in the soles. He gave one to a group of Malaysian jihadists, then wore the other as he flew back to the UK.

He told New York Federal Court that his mission was to find a suitable flight at a later date and set off the shoe bomb in mid-air.

American, transatlantic and European routes were discussed during brainstorming sessions with Bin Laden’s deputy Khalid Sheik Mohammed.

He said they also discussed plans to hijack a plane and crash it into Canary Wharf – then London’s tallest building.

'Hug': Osama Bin Laden 'hugged' Badat in Pakistan and told him how to 'break' the chain that forms America

Badat said he discussed plans to fly a plane into Canary Wharf with Bin Laden months after the 9/11 attacks

Bin Laden’s deputy, now in American custody and due to stand trial on terrorism charges, told Badat and other would-be suicide bombers to avoid checking flight paths on the internet.

'He instructed us on how to communicate with each other in general language and using swear words,' he said.

'The belief was that practicing, devout Muslims would not use that kind of language.'

Badat, who was speaking via video link from the UK, ultimately backed out of the shoe-bombing after talking to his dad.

'I reconnected with my parents back in the United Kingdom,' he said.

'My father knew I had travelled to Afghanistan but he didn’t know who I was associating with.

'He’d heard of sleepers – covert terrorist operators – and said if he found out I was a sleeper he would kill me.'

Abu Hamza faces life in jail. His trial in New York is expected to last five weeks

Badat’s associate Richard Reid was over-powered by passengers while attempting to light one of his shoe bombs on a flight from Paris to Miami.

Badat, now 35, was arrested and jailed for his part in the conspiracy. His 15-year sentence was slashed when he agreed to testify against other alleged terrorists including Hamza. 

He was freed in 2010 after just five years in jail and last month gave evidence via video link against Osama bin Laden’s son-in-law Sulaiman Abu Ghaith.

At yesterday’s hearing Badat told how he’d left home as a teenager and moved to London, where he became involved in a radical Muslim youth movement called the Tooting Circle.

He told the court that he had twice heard Hamza preach at the Finsbury Park mosque in 1997.

'It was very crowded, there were hundreds there. Hamza, I saw had no arms and his tone was shouting,' he said.

After hearing Hamza speak, Badat said he travelled with other members of the Tooting Circle to Bosnia to see how Muslims were fighting there.

From there he went to Afghanistan and Pakistan for al-Qaeda training.  

Hamza, wearing a navy blue prison t-shirt and black jogging trousers, without the hooks he usually uses for hands, stared intently at the video screen and made notes using a fake arm with a clasp and pen attached to it.

The 56-year-old one-eyed cleric has pleaded not guilty to 11 terrorism charges including a 1998 attack on tourists in Yemen that killed four.

Hamza, who lost his hands and eye during an explosion in Afghanistan, was extradited from the UK two years ago.

His trial is expected to last five weeks and if convicted he faces life in jail.
