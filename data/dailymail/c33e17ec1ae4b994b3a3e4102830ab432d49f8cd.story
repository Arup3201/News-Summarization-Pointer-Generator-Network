A wife-from-hell was slapped with a long ASBO after she kept her neighbours awake for three years because she was constantly nagging her husband.

Julie Griffiths, 43, breached a noise abatement order a staggering 47 times in three months this year and was warned she could face jail if she does not calm down, a court heard.

It came after residents living near her £75,000 mid-terraced home in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, were put through hell as she constantly 'screamed' at her 'sweet-natured' husband Norman, 63.

ASBO: Noisy Julie Griffiths outside her home where she shouted at her husband so much it kept the neighbours up for three years

Mrs Griffiths was first served the notice in 1999 but she was fined £500 when she breached it again in 2010.

Stoke-on-Trent Magistrates Court heard her behaviour persisted over the next two years and environmental health officers installed monitoring equipment in a neighbour's home this July.

Yesterday Griffiths pleaded guilty to failing to comply with the requirements of a noise abatement notice.

Staffordshire Magistrates Court imposed a five-year ASBO which prohibits her from engaging in behaviour which causes or is likely to cause a nuisance, disturbance, harassment or alarm to her neighbours.

She was warned she could go to jail for five years if she breaches the antisocial order, fined £500 and told to pay £250 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

Lisa Hall, prosecuting for the Borough Council, said it was 'by far the worst' noise case an environmental health officer had ever had to deal with.

She added that the noise abatement notice was breached 47 times between July 4 and October 22 this year.

Steve Lee, defending, said Griffiths, a factory worker, became over-tired after working 12-hour shifts on four consecutive days and sometimes had to 'let off steam' to her husband of 23 years.

Hellish: Residents of this street in Stoke have spoken of just how noisy Mrs Griffiths is and how patient her husband Norman must be

He added: 'She accepts her voice got so loud it would have disturbed the neighbours.

'She doesn't mean to do it. She comes across as an emotional woman and vents frustration by shouting and screaming.

'She does not go round committing violence, it is simply shouting within the confines of her own home.

'She realises now that she has to keep it down.'

The five-year ASBO means Griffiths must not: create noise audible to neighbouring properties, shout, scream or bang on internal doors, or contact or communicate with her neighbours.

After the case Councillor Tony Kearon, said: 'This is a great result for the council and, in particular, for Mrs Griffiths' neighbours who have suffered this woman's appalling behaviour at first hand over a very long period.

'Our message is clear - we are here to support our communities. 'If you are experiencing problems, come to us for help. We will not tolerate anti-social behaviour.'

A council spokesman added: 'Many of the incidents concerned Griffiths screaming at her husband on a regular basis.'

Neighbours yesterday said living next door to Griffiths had 'been hell.'

One, who did not want to be named, said: 'Everyone in the street is sick to the back teeth of her.

'Everyone just feels so sorry for her husband Norman who is the sweetest man you could ever meet.

'He must have the patience of a saint.'
