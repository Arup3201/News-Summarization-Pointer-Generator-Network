Fled: Amanda Berry called 911 seconds after she fled the Cleveland dungeon

A Cleveland 911 dispatch tape released on Wednesday gives a revealing insight into how the situation unfolded for dispatchers and police after they received Amanda Berry’s call for help.

Police were initially dispatched at 5:51pm on Monday after a report of a 911 call from a female ‘who says her named is Amanda Berry and that she had been kidnapped ten years ago.’

The dispatcher sent officers to 2210 Seymour Avenue where Berry had said she fled after escaping her captor's home at 2207 Seymour Avenue, where she had been held captive for a decade.

By 5:55 p.m., police arrived at the scene and immediately recognized the seriousness of the situation.

‘This might be for real,’ an officer can be heard saying. ‘Georgina DeJesus might be in this house also.’

Then at about 5:59 p.m., an officer confirmed what no one was expecting to happen.

‘We found ‘em. We found ‘em,’ said the officer while cries from the women can be heard in the background.

An officer then called for ambulances to respond to the scene, as one of the women was having trouble breathing.

Within a short period, Cleveland police confirmed they had located missing women Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight, as well as Berry’s six-year-old daughter. All three were taken to the hospital.

Cleveland officials have revealed 
they are reviewing the actions of the 911 dispatcher who took Amanda 
Berry’s call seconds after she fled the Cleveland dungeon where 
she and two others had been held captive.

The 911 dispatcher - one of the first
people Miss Berry spoke to after her decade long captivity - has been 
criticized for not comforting the distressed caller and not keeping the 
26-year-old on the phone until the police arrived.

Miss Berry's phone call on Monday evening from a neighbor's phone lasted less than two minutes.

Miss Berry, who disappeared in 2003 aged 14, is heard screaming down the phone to an Ohio police operator: 'I've been kidnapped and I've been missing for 10 years, and I'm, I'm here, I'm free now.'

But multiple times the
dispatcher’s response was 'Talk to the police when they get there,' before asking the name of Miss 
Berry’s captor, as well as his age and ethnicity.

In the 911 call Miss Berry implores 
the dispatcher that she needs the police immediately, but she is told 
authorities will be sent as soon as a 'car becomes open.'

At one point when Miss Berry says 'I'm 
Amanda Berry. I've been on the news for the last 10 years,' the 
dispatcher replies 'I got that, dear.'

In the recording the emotional cries from DeJesus and Knight can be heard.

As Miss Berry becomes more frantic the dispatcher says 'The police are on their way; talk to them when they get there.' 

The dispatcher, whose identity has not been revealed, repeats again  'I told you they're on their way; talk to them when they get there, OK.'

'One of the things that jumped out 
was that after the dispatch took the information, she moved on to the 
next call. I think that realizing the gravity of the situation, the 
dispatch might have stayed on the call with that person,'  Gary Allen, a
dispatcher for 20 years in Berkeley, California told the Daily Beast.

'You generally want to hold the person on the phone and try to make a personal connection until law enforcement can get there.'

CBS58 played
the full 9-1-1 call for Kenosha County Telecommunications and Training 
Officer Sandy Zuerlein, who admitted she would have kept Miss Berry on 
the phone. 

'In this call, she was afraid that 
the man who had her was coming back.  If I had kept her on the phone, 
and he came back, we could have alerted officers,' Ms Zuerlein said.  

In response Cleveland Department of Public Safety 
Director Martin Flask said police were dispatched and on scene in the 
west side neighborhood in less than two minutes.

'While the call-taker complied 
with policies and procedures which enabled a very fast response by 
police, we have noted some concerns which will be the focus of our 
review, including the call-taker’s failure to remain on the line with 
Ms. Berry until police arrived on scene.

'Please be assured that this matter will be investigated, and if necessary, appropriate corrective action taken.

'I would like to note that the 
call-taker did take the call, create an event and send it to the channel
dispatcher in less than 90 seconds. Within 1 minutes and 18 seconds 
from the time that the call-taker answered the call our dispatcher was 
broadcasting the assignment to available police units.

'As a result of the call-taker’s actions, police were dispatched and on scene in less than two minutes.'
