A Mexican couple have been arrested after horrific images emerged of the father throwing his baby girl across the room - because her crying woke him up.

Mario Obed Meneses Lopez, 21, and his 16-year-old girlfriend were arrested after a video was taken of him slinging the two-month-old baby girl around by her neck and throwing her across the room.

Police were called by a concerned friend of the mother who surreptitiously filmed the attack and handed it to officers.

The video showed Lopez lying in bed next to the screaming baby before swinging her around by her neck and flinging her across the room where she is heard crying out in terror.

The mistreatment continues as Lopez is shown kicking the baby several times.

The mother, who cannot be named because of her age, is heard telling him to stop, but does nothing to take the child away from him.

She can be heard saying in the video: 'That's it Mario, leave her alone.'

Prosecutors in Mexico City confirmed they have arrested the pair.

The baby was subsequently taken to hospital and once she had been given the all clear by medics, she was taken into care.

Medics said the baby girl suffered from numerous bruises - some  from the assault caught on video, but others which were from an earlier attack.

Carlos Orta Garcia, director of System for Family Development, said: 'We found evidence of cigarette burns and head trauma caused by separate attacks.'

The abuse took place at a house  in Valle de Chalco Solidaridadoc, a municipality on the eastern outskirts of the metropolitan area of Mexico City.

Police spokesman Fariol Jaramillo Munoz said: 'The man shown in the video had been living with his 16-year-old girlfriend. 

'He was the father of the child and the baby is now a ward of court.

'Both of them now face prosecution for child abuse. 

'The mother was an accessory because she failed to act despite the fact that she could clearly see the baby was being harmed. 

'They were identified as the subjects on the video through their tattoos and distinguishing marks.'
