A holy relic containing the blood of Pope John Paul II has been stolen from a chapel in Italy.

A massive manhunt is underway after the rare ampoule was snatched from a medieval sanctuary dedicated to the late Pope in the Abruzzo mountains.

Police are investigating the possibility that a Satanist sect could be involved, as the theft coincided with an important date in the Satanist calendar.

Assassination attempt: The ampule contains a piece of blood-soaked cloth that dates back to the 1981 assassination attempt on John Paul II on May 13 1981, in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City

Thieves ignored other items and focused on this, giving rise to speculation that it was Satanists

Venerated since medieval times for their healing powers, religious relics still have the power to draw crowds.

A selection of artefacts associated with John Paul II is touring Europe, as the Vatican prepares to officially declare the former Pope a saint in April.

The ampule containing a piece of blood-soaked cloth, dating back to the 1981 assassination attempt on John Paul, was bestowed on the tiny sanctuary of Pietro della Ienca, on the mountain peak of Gran Sasso, where the pontiff used to take skiing holidays.

Thieves sawed through iron bars on the window, officials said, and took the ampule alongside a crucifix. There was no CCTV or alarm in the chapel.

Close call: The Pope was shot and critically wounded when Mehmet Ali Agca (his gun is circled) shsot him four times while he was entering the square

Fifty carabinieri and sniffer dogs were yesterday combing the mountain where fascist dictator Mussolini was rescued by SS commandoes after his capture by Allied forces in 1943.

President of the village cultural society, Pasquale Corriere, said: ‘It was no doubt stolen to order. The thieves touched nothing but the relic and the crucifix.

‘They did not force the door of the sacristy or open the chest containing donations, which convinces me that [the relic] was the target’.

The hope is that the thieves repent and bring it back, he added.

Grisly: Other remnants of John Paul's tenancy include a bullet-pierced cassock that the former pontiff was wearing at the time of the 1981 assassination attempt, a tuft of hair cut from the Pope's head a few days before his death and some blood-soaked gauze saved from an operation

Religious studies teacher Giovanni Panunzio, of the Osservatorio Antiplagio, a group which supports victims of charlatans, said that the date of the theft represented new birth for Satanists, so, in this phase of the year, ‘blood and crosses are symbolic objects to desecrate’.

He added: ‘The market for religious statues for Satanic ects is particularly vibrant right now. Unique sacred objects, even those without any artistic merit, are sold for tens of thousands of euros.’

Police in Abruzzo said they were investigating all leads.

The relic was given to the chapel in 2011 by John Paul’s private secretary, Stanislaw Dziwisz.

Other grisly remnants of John Paul's tenancy include a bullet-pierced cassock that the former pontiff was wearing at the time of the 1981 assassination attempt, a tuft of hair cut from the Pope's head a few days before his death and some blood-soaked gauze saved from an operation.

The mantle, which John Paul II was wearing when he was targeted in St Peter's Square, was secretly hidden by Dziwisz and its existence only revealed after his death in 2005.

Religious orders are vying for ampoules of blood, taken by the pope's personal physician and sent to a hospital in Rome during the his dying days in case a blood transfusion was needed.

One precious vessel of blood was almost lost in September 2012 when a priest carrying it on a train, near Rome, was distracted and robbed by three bandits. It was found just hours later lying in a field.

The relics were a crucial part of the campaign which saw John Paul II made the fastest saint in modern times. The event is to take place in record-breaking time just nine years after his death in 2005.

The last obstacle to his canonisation was cleared last year when doctors approved the second of two required miracles.

The Vatican maintains that to put a price on a sacred objects is sacrilegious.

But Ebay does a roaring trade in JP II relics with 'authentic' vestments worn by the late Pope starting at about $40.

In 2007 the Vatican was overrun with nearly 200,000 requests for pieces of John Paul II's cassock after offering them for free on the internet.
