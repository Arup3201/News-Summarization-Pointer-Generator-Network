Covering up: New guidelines banning shopkeepers from displaying lingerie and skimpy clothing on mannequins outside shops could be passed in Mumbai

Mannequins displaying lingerie could be banned in Mumbai in a bid to halt India's rape epidemic.

Mumbai's municipal council passed a resolution barring stores from displaying scantily-clad mannequins outside city shops.

The ruling will come into effect if it is approved by the muncipal commissioner.

It comes as news emerged that two western women were raped in India in the last two days.

A 30-year-old American tourist was gang-raped by three men while hitchhiking back to a guest house in the northern resort of Manali this morning.

The attack came just a day after it emerged that a a 21-year-old Irish charity worker was allegedly drugged and raped while volunteering with an aid agency in Kolkata.

They are the latest in a spate of sexual assaults on foreign women in India that have led to safety warnings and a drop in the number of female tourists travelling to the country.

The resolutionÂ  to ban mannequins wearing lingerie was suggested by city councillor Ritu Tawde who said that such displays not only degrade women but could also encourage men to attack them.

She said: 'Such people get provoked by mannequins. After all, a mannequin is a replica of a woman's body. That's why I oppose it, because mannequins do not suit Indian culture.'

Although the ruling will ban mannequins from going on display outside shops, retailers will still be able to display them how they wish inside stores.

Business officials have criticised the proposals, saying that they will have no impact on violence against women.

Viren Shah, president of the Federation of Retail Traders' Welfare Association, said: 'We are living in the 21st century where these kinds of things, all porn, the movies, the pictures, all these things are available on websites, available on mobiles. (A) mannequin hardly makes any difference to the people.'

But Tawde said pornographic internet images are very different than the mannequins.

She said: 'If someone wants to watch pornography on the net, that is a conscious choice that he is making. In this case, the mannequins are everywhere and people don't have a choice.

Calls for protection: The gang rape and murder of a student in New Delhi sparked widespread protest in India back in December

'They run into them when they step out of their homes and walk on the streets.'

Indians have increasingly demanded stronger protection for women since the gang rape and killing of a student on a bus in the capital of New Delhi in December.

That rape sparked public protests demanding better protection for women.

In response, the government passed a law increasing prison terms for rape and providing for the death penalty in cases of rape that result in death or leave the victim in a coma. It also made voyeurism, stalking, acid attacks and the trafficking of women punishable under criminal law.
