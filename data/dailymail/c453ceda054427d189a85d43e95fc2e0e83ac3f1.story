It is the star of New York's skyline.

Now, for a cool $1 billion, it could be yours.

The Empire State Building is going up for sale.

No longer the world's tallest, but still the most iconic, the 102-storey skyscraper has been the subject of gushing poems, films and music since it emerged in 1931.

And today, in a move that has sent the market into a frenzy, reports emerged that the Malkin family, owner of the legendary art deco tower, plans to let it go.

Iconic: The 1931 art deco building was dwarfed by the World Trade Center in 1972 but remains legendary

Starting as early as this week, the multibillionaires will launch a 'roadshow' to pitch the sale to investors around the world.

They hope to fetch $1 billion (Â£620,000,000) for the landmark and 17 other properties in what could be the second biggest public offering of real estate in American history.

A breath-taking landmark and the star of King Kong, An Affair to Remember, and Sleepless in Seattle, the sale has 'sex appeal', realtor Joel Beam told Wall Street Journal.

However, experts warn the building's highlight - the observatory deck - could be cast into shadow by the 104-storey One World Trade Center, set to emerge next door in 2015.

The viewing point accounts for two thirds of its income. Visitors get an unrivaled view of New York

Competition: Experts warn the Empire State Building, left, will not attract the same number of visitors when the One World Trade Center, right, the world's third-tallest building, opens with dramatic views of the city

The One World Trade Center, built on the Ground Zero site of the fallen World Trade Center Towers, which were brought down in the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, officially surpassed the Empire State Building as the tallest building in New York in May.

The One World Trade Center will stand at 1,776 feet to the tip of its antenna when it is completed in 2015.

It will then be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere and the third tallest building in the world.

But this should not be an issue for investors, marketing analyst Michael Knott warned, as the building has an unusual amount of office space available for leasing.

The Malkins won the support of their 2,800 stockholders in May to sell the building through an initial public offering (IPO), despite numerous offers from private investors.

Once they have pitched to investors in major cities around the world, the family hopes to draw up a deal by the start of October through Bank of America and Goldman Sachs.

Stardom: Shoedsack's 1933 thriller, King Kong. It catapulted the tower into film star status around the world

Meg Ryan's character touts the building as the most romantic place in the world in Sleepless in Seattle, 1993

It is the spot where Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant plan to unite to live happily ever after in An Affair to Remember

It is expected to fall just shy of the biggest ever IPO - the sale of SingTel satellite unit in Singapore for $3 billion.

Opened in May 1931 by President Hoover, the Empire State Building towered 200 feet over the city's tallest towers.

Two years later, the skyscraper was catapulted into film star status with the release of King Kong. The film hinged on the dazzling height and glistening glamour of the building, as a screaming Fay Wray clung to the spire.

This was the first of infinite tributes made to a building branded as 'the physical embodiment of the American dream'.

F Scott Fitzgerald touted it as 'the most magnificent of towers' in My Lost City.

Sleepless in Seattle hinges on the idea that the observatory deck is the most romantic place in the world.

Meg Ryan's character in the 1993 film is enamoured with the tower on Fifth Avenue and 34th Street after seeing An Affair to Remember, starring Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.

In it, the lovers make a pact to meet at the top of the building in six months time to live happily ever after.

It started as a plot of land inherited by the well-heeled Astor family who habitually demolished their mansions and replaced them with taller ones

It started as a competition between brothers.

John Jacob Astor Jr and William Backhouse Astor inherited a plot each on Fifth Avenue - one cornered with 33rd street, the other with 34th.

On 33rd, John erected a mansion in 1859.

In 1862, his younger brother William trumped him with a bigger mansion next door - on 34th.

In 1893, John's son, William Waldorf Astor, demolished their mansion and built the Waldorf Hotel.

Four years later, in 1897, their family and neighbours razed their mansion to make way for the Astoria Hotel.

The competition stopped there though, and in 1928, the Astoria was sold to an engineering corporation for $20 million.

By 1930, a work force of 3,000 men would excavate the site and begin construction on New York's dazzling icon.

Working at a rate of four-and-a-half stories a week, it seemed to leap into the air.

In 1933, President Hoover pressed a gimmick button to turn on the lights of the building.

Over time it has welcomed billions of visitors, sanctioned free-climbs of the tower (the first in 1937), and held Valentine's weddings (the first in 1994).

It remained the tallest building in the world until 1972 when it was dwarfed by the World Trade Center.

In 2002, Peter L Malkin, who already owned the 114-year lease on the tower, became the owner and manager when he bought the building.
