A newly-released 911 tape from the Florida movie theater shooting reveals that the alleged shooter sat and watched the victim die from a gunshot wound to the chest.

A frantic call was made from the movie theater in Wesley Chapel, Florida at 1.29pm on January 13 after a shot rang out.

A caller is heard on the tape telling the dispatcher 'there’s been a gunshot... it looks like it broke his sternum' with a 'shotgun or pistol'.

He also frantically alerts the dispatcher to the fact that the shooter, 'an older gentleman', is still present.

Suspected Florida movie theater shooter Curtis Reeves was led away in handcuffs wearing a white jumpsuit after police removed his clothing for evidence. A 911 call released today revealed he had watched as his alleged victim died from a gunshot wound

The dispatcher, from the Pasco County Sheriff's Office, asks: 'Do you know who shot him?'

The caller said: 'I don’t know…it looks like an older gentleman in the movie theater.'

'Is he still in there?', says the sheriff's office responder.

'Yes, he is,' comes the callers whispered response.

Meanwhile married father-of-one Chad Oulson, 43, was lying on the floor of the movie theater with a gunshot wound to the chest.

The 911 caller, who explains that he is a trained nurse, says: 'Looks like there’s blood going through his lungs, so we need someone here fast.'

A woman then takes the phone asking: 'Where are they? The pulse is really slow…I can’t feel it anymore.'

The dispatcher tries to calm the callers, telling them that help is on the way. At 10 minutes, 11 seconds after the call is placed, police arrive - but it is too late to save Mr Oulson. 

Devastated: The killing of Chad Oulson, center, has left 22-month-old Lexy, right, without a father and Nicole Oulson a widow

Florida Police Captain Curtis Reeves, Jr., suspected of fatally shooting Chad Oulson, 43, and wounding his wife, Nicole, 33, appears in court wearing a suicide-prevention gown

Curtis Reeves, 71, is charged with second-degree murder in the death of the married father. He is being held without bail at Land O' Lakes jail in Florida.

Chad Oulson's widow Nicole 
struggled to contain her emotions as she spoke on Thursday about the 
day that her husband was shot dead.

The couple had gone on a rare date to watch the movie Lone Survivor, leaving their 22-month-old daughter, Lexy, with a babysitter.

As Mr Ouslon checked his phone for 
any word on his daughter during the previews, another cinema-goer, 
retired police officer and father-of-two Curtis Reeves who was sitting behind the couple with his wife, asked him to put it away.

An
 argument ensued - with some witnesses saying Mr Oulson threw popcorn - 
and Reeves shot the father once in the chest. Mrs Oulson was shot 
in her hand as she tried to protect her husband.

She said that she wants his 'senseless' killer locked up for life.

'He brought an unfair life sentence to me to have to raise our daughter alone,' Nicole Oulson, 33, told Good Morning America in her first live interview.

'To
 have to live without the love of my life, for my daughter to have to 
grow up without her daddy by her side for graduation and marriage.

'It was so unnecessary. It was for no reason, so I want him behind bars and to be punished for his senseless act.'

Heartbroken: Nicole Oulson spoke to Good Morning America on Thursday about the loss of her husband, Chad, who was shot dead in a movie theater last week. She said she wants his killer locked up forever

Lawyers representing the Oulson family 
have confirmed that Lexy was unwell and that Chad was keeping a close 
eye on his phone in case he and Nicole had to leave early and go to pick
 her up.

Mrs Oulson said her husband was 'absolutely not' threatening the shooter.

'I
 never expected it,' she said. 'I never could have imagined it. There 
were a couple of words, no threats, no harm, no nothing.'

Her attorney, TJ Grimaldi, joined her
 on Good Morning America and said that Reeves might try to use the 
controversial 'stand your ground' law for his defense.

'There's just no way that this can stand up in this case,' he said. 'In my opinion it doesn't matter if it was
 popcorn, Twizzlers, a hot cup of coffee - there is absolutely no reason 
that it should have to escalate like this.'

Torn apart: She said the killer left her without the love of her life, Chad, center, and Lexy without a daddy

Now Mrs Oulson said she is just trying to be there for her young daughter.

'She's luckily at a young age... she doesn't know what's going on,' she said.

But she knows there are things her husband did she will never be able to replace, such as putting Lexy to bed.

'The 
last thing he would say before tucking her in was, "You make me so happy," and she would say, "Me happy 
too, Daddy". And those are the times I'll never be able to replace, and that's when it's hard.'

Mr Oulson's colleagues at Sky Power Sports have set up a Facebook page to raise money for Nicole and Lexy. Visit the page here.
