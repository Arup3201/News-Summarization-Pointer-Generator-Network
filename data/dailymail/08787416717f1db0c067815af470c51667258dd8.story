My battle: Maureen Nolan suffers from deafness

The Nolan sisters are no strangers to tragedy and trauma. Between them they have endured difficult childhoods, infidelity, domestic violence and divorce.

And now they are facing their biggest ordeal of all as Bernie bravely confronts the final stages of breast cancer.

It’s a situation that has focused the minds of all the girls – and left one of them, Maureen, determined to tackle a health problem that has been blighting her life: deafness

‘Seeing Bernie so poorly has made me more aware than ever that we should do what we can to look after ourselves and make sure we live life to the full,’ she explains.

‘I feel so blessed that hearing is my only health problem, which is entirely in my control to fix and can be easily resolved.’

Maureen, 58, says her problems date back to the early days of the sisters’ singing career. ‘I have just 50 per cent hearing in my right ear,’ she reveals. ‘I remember doing a 1960s rock ’n’ roll tour and being deaf every night when I came off stage, with a hissing in my ear.

‘I have been subjected to such massive noise through work – you’ve no idea how loud it could be on stage, even performing in the working men’s clubs when we were kids.’

Today Maureen is speaking about her problem for the first time, to launch Specsavers’ Sound Barrier Star Awards, which celebrate achievement by people with hearing loss. You wouldn’t know it to look at her, but Maureen has two new hearing aids that she says have transformed her life.

With her beauty, youthful looks and glamorous make-up and hair, Maureen certainly crushes the stereotype of a hearing-aid wearer as elderly and debilitated.

‘I know there’s a stigma about wearing hearing aids but I don’t understand why,’ she says. ‘I don’t mind mine at all – with these new models, you can’t see them at all anyway.’

To demonstrate, she pops out the two tiny devices that sit in her ear canal – the size, shape and colour of a baked bean – and puts them on the table.

Behind the jollity, the troubles to 
have hit the family are never far from  her mind. Bernie, 53, has 
advanced, incurable breast cancer and is the third of the singing 
sisters to be diagnosed with the disease.

‘She’s got cancer of everything now, really,’ says Maureen, who is staying with Bernie the week we meet. ‘What’s worse – and what will get her – 
is that she has lung cancer and now lung disease. She is on oxygen and 
it’s very traumatic.’

It is a very different picture back at Maureen’s home in Blackpool, where she lives with husband Ritchie Hoyle, 48, a music tour manager. Their son Danny, 24, has just moved back in with his fiancee Maddison, 23, and daughter Sienna, two.

‘It’s a mad house. Danny was floundering a bit with bills so I said he was welcome to come and live with us. I’m thrilled.

‘My husband is still a bit traumatised, with the baby jumping on him every morning – but I grew up in a mad household so I love it. I didn’t ever want him to leave,’ says Maureen.

It was her family who first noticed 
her hearing problems. ‘They’re never shy of telling it like it is,’ says
Maureen. ‘They used to say, “God you’re deaf.” But I’d say, “No, no, 
you’re not speaking clearly.” I was always turning up the TV and my son 
would come in and say, “Mum that’s deafening!”

‘I found it hard to interact with people sometimes, but I never thought my hearing was making life difficult.’

Two
years ago, Maureen finally accepted something was wrong as she lay in 
bed talking to Ritchie – and noticed she was lifting her head off the 
pillow whenever he spoke.

Tragedy: Bernie Nolan was diagnosed with cancer in 2010 and was recently told it is terminal

‘I was raising myself up to stop my left ear being muffled as that was the only way I could hear him,’ she says. ‘I thought, “I should be able to hear with just one ear,” but I couldn’t. I knew then that I had a problem.’

But like most people who fear they are losing their hearing, Maureen did nothing about it.

She says: ‘When you’re not completely deaf and managing to enjoy life, it’s easy to ignore it. But as time went on it got much worse – often I’d know someone was talking to me but be unable to work out what they were saying. My sense of humour went out of the door as I kept missing jokes.’

In March this year, she finally went for a hearing test. ‘It was a shock to find I had just 50 per cent hearing in my right ear. The other ear has a slight degeneration, too.’

While many people might be upset by the prospect of hearing aids, Maureen was happy.

‘I was relieved as I wasn’t living life to the full,’ she says. ‘Getting older is a very gradual thing so whatever it brings doesn’t really upset me.

‘I’m still pretty healthy, I look OK and I’ll cope with it. Older people think losing their hearing is a reflection on them ageing. But it’s much more ageing to not be able to keep up with what’s going on around you. I was left out of conversations as I couldn’t hear – and that ages you more than anything.’

Maureen’s hearing loss could be partly genetic – her 86-year-old aunt is profoundly deaf and her mother has otosclerosis, a hereditary condition in which bone grows across the ear. Maureen has yet to find out if she is affected, though it can be corrected through surgery.

However, she admits that using the hearing aids has taken some adjustment. ‘I could immediately hear more clearly what people were saying. But I found it weird hearing my own voice in my head – it’s like sticking your fingers in your ears so your voice is amplified.’

Maureen is currently touring with the hit musical Blood Brothers. She says: ‘I’ve tried out the hearing aids during a sound check, but not for the show itself as that would take getting used to and the stage is the one place I’ve never had a problem.’

She is now determined to fix the hearing of the rest of her famous clan – whose best-known hit was I’m In The Mood For Dancing in 1979. ‘When I told my sisters about my hearing loss they just laughed,’ she says.

‘My brother Tommy already has a hearing aid – he’s the eldest of us at 64 – and I’m encouraging all my sisters to get tested.

‘It’s funny but I really notice hearing problems in other people now – they cock their head to one side and ask you to repeat things, or have a vacant look as they haven’t heard properly.’

For Maureen, that is a reminder of how much hearing aids have helped.

‘I wish I’d done it years ago,’ she says. ‘The worst thing about hearing loss is the isolation. With aids, you become part of society again. And I now have the TV at a normal sound level – which is a relief to everybody in the house!’
