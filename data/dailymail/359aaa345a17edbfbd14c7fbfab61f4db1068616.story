A New York bus monitor who suffered relentless bullying from four middle school students has received more than $700,000 - raised by a Canadian man who was moved by her story.

Karen Klein, of Greece, New York, received the money at a ceremony on Tuesday in Canada.

The 68-year-old was tormented with profanity, insults and threats during a bus run as the school year wound down in June.

Retirement fund: Karen Klein, right, was presented with a check for more than $700,000 by Max Sidorov, left, of Toronto, who said he was struck by her story

A 10-minute cellphone video taken by another student took on a life of its own on the internet and spawned an outpouring of $703,833 in donations for Klein from all over the world.

The large novelty check was handed to her by 25-year-old Max Sidorov, a Toronto nutritionist with the help of fundraising site Indiegogo.

Sidorov said that he two bullied as a student and started the drive with the goal of raising $5,000 to send Klein on vacation.

But he couldn’t have expected the flood of financial support that came in, enough to send Klein on more than 140 vacations.

An Indiegogo spokeswoman said that more than 30,000 people from 84 countries contributed to the fund.

Victim: Regardless of the vacation she is yet to take, Klein said that the attention has already sent her all over North America

Unacceptable: At one point, a student says: 'If I
 stabbed you in the stomach, my knife would f***** go through like 
butter, because it’s all f***** lard'

Regardless of the vacation she is yet to take, Klein said on Tuesday that the attention has already sent her all over North America.

She told CBC News: 'I came [to Canada]. I went to New York City to be on the Today Show; I went to Boston to be on a radio show.'

Klein told the network that she visited New Orleans on country singer Tim McGraw’s dime, and took a trip to California 'thanks to Anderson Cooper.'

The video shows Klein trying to ignore a stream of profanity, insults and threats from the seventh-grade boys.

One of the students can be heard saying: 'If I stabbed you in the stomach, my knife would f***** go through like butter, because it’s all f***** lard.'

At one point, she even breaks down in tears.

Retiring: Bus monitor Karen Klein, who was cruelly bullied by four seventh-graders,  says she is planning to retire

The four middle school students were suspended for a year, and have been barred from regular bus transportation.In an interview with the Associated Press in July, Klein said the punishment was ‘fine with me.' Klein said they'll still be going to an alternative school - 'they won't be just sitting at home doing nothing.'

She said that the best part of her ordeal going public, and the resulting school action, 'is that they have to do community service - for senior citizens.'

The Greece, New York, grandmother has since retired.

Klein said that her decision to leave the job she held for three years was tough but wasn't based on her now infamous encounter with the mean-spirited seventh-graders.

Speaking at the ceremony on Tuesday, Klein said: 'When you’re an adult and you get bullied, that’s one thing. I can handle it, but children can't. They just... it sticks with them forever, and I hope it stops.'

Painful memories: Speaking from her home in July, Klein said how hurt she was by the boys' vile words
