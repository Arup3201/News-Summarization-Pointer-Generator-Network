Paris Saint-Germain reduced Marseille's lead at the top of Ligue 1 to one point after winning 'Le Classique' at the Parc des Princes thanks to goals from Lucas Moura and Edinson Cavani.

PSG, who were boosted by the return of Zlatan Ibrahimovic from a heel injury he sustained in late September, remain second in the standings with 27 points from 13 games. Marseille have 28 points from 13.

The Parisians struggled early on with Marseille pressing high-up and forcing their arch rivals into a string of poor passes and late tackles.

PSG : Sirigu, Aurier, Silva, Luiz, Maxwell, Verratti (Cabaye 66), Matuidi, Pastore (Marquinhos 88), Moura, Cavani, Lavezzi (Ibrahimovic 65)

Goals: Lucas 38, Cavani 85

Marseille : Mandanda; Dja Djedje, Fanni, Nkoulou, Mendy; Lemina (Barrada 76), Imbula; Alessandrini, Payet, Thauvin (Batshuayi 66); Gignac

Sent off: Imbula 78

Andre-Pierre Gignac hit the upright with a bullet header from a corner in the fifth minute and two minutes later Romain Alessandrini whisked a half-volley passed the post after good work from Benjamin Mendy on the right.

As the first half wore on undefeated PSG began to get a hold of the game with Marseille losing some intensity and they broke the deadlock when captain Thiago Silva surged forward, fed Cavani who set free Ezequiel Lavezzi who then crossed for Lucas to tap home after 37 minutes.

Gignac should have levelled just after half-time after stealing the ball off Silva, but with just the keeper to beat he opted for a complicated chip.

With Giannelli Imbula shown a straight red card with just over 10 minutes remaining, Marseille's hopes of turning the game round were over.

Cavani sealed the win heading home his fifth goal in five games after a pinpoint cross from right back Serge Aurier, who had been released by 65th-minute substitute Ibrahimovic.

'Physically Marseille were better than us,' PSG coach Blanc said.

'But it made us aware that we needed to raise our level, and our second half was of a very high standard.'

PSG welcomed back star striker Ibrahimovic after seven weeks out with a heel injury but he was kept on the bench until the 65th minute, and then played largely for himself as he missed out teammates on several occasions when they were much better placed.

'He's a unique player for us,' PSG left back Maxwell said. 'Little by little he will find his form again.'
