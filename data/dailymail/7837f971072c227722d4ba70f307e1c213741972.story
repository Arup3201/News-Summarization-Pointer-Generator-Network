A female mobile phone boss in Russia has been accused of 'humiliating' sales managers by forcing them to pose almost naked as 'punishment' for poor sales figures.  

Her employees were ordered to strip to their underwear or swimming costumes and their pictures were posted on a closed company website, it is claimed.  

The site was only accessible to staff of Russian mobile giant MTS - until the pictures were leaked onto the open web with the faces hidden. 

Punishment: A female mobile phone boss in Russia has been accused of 'humiliating' sales managers by forcing them to pose almost naked as 'punishment' for poor sales figures

Yulia Biktimirova, the accused mobile phone boss, has denied the claim, saying her employees in the region of Tatarstan were instead willingly posing for pictures to enliven a corporate party.

Despite her denial, the head office of MTS - one of the big three mobile networks in Russia - has launched a formal investigation into the claims.  

An ex-manager, identified only as Sergei R, told the Russian media that Biktimirova 'forced employees to pose half naked if they failed to sell certain goods within a set period of time. If they refused, they lost their money. 

Undress: One source said staff were forced 'to pose in their underwear or bikinis in their offices'

'One day I just could not cope with such humiliation any longer and abused this top manager. I had to resign afterwards.'

Another source said staff were forced 'to pose in their underwear or bikinis in their offices'.

Biktimirova insisted: 'Our employees did really pose in swimming costumes in our offices but it was purely their own idea.

'They were getting ready for a corporate party and decided to take shocking pictures thinking it would be funny and unusual.

'We do not have punishments. Maybe someone from among our sacked staff now wants to make a scandal.'

One picture has the words 'central office' scrawled across it, and one of the women workers has the Russian letters from MTS scrawled on one breast and an unknown reference number on the other.
