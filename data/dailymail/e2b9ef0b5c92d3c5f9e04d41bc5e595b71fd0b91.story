The United States is flying 'manned' 
intelligence missions over Nigeria in an effort to locate from the sky more than 200 abducted schoolgirls, a senior U.S. 
official said Monday.

Washington
 has also shared 'commercial satellite imagery' with the Nigerian 
authorities in the hunt for the missing teenagers, the senior 
administration official said, asking to remain anonymous. Officials have given their permission for the U.S. missions to take place.

The
 news comes after a chilling new video was 
released by the extremist group Boko Harem, who have apparently forced 
the Christian teens to convert to Islam.Â

Misisons: U.S. 'manned' missions are flying over Nigeria in an effort to spot the girls, pictured in video by Nigeria's Boko Haram terrorist network, released Monday

Where are they: The kidnapped schoolgirls are seen at an unknown location in this still image taken from the undated video

Under the guns of their captors, dozens of barefoot girls sat huddled together wearing gray Muslim veils as they chanted Quranic verses in Arabic.

'I swear to almighty Allah, you will not see them again until you release our brothers that you have captured,' the leader of the terrorist network threatened, an assault rifle slung across his chest.

The video released by the group Monday offered the first public glimpse of what it claimed were some of the nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped a month ago. The girls' plight has spurred a global movement to secure their freedom.

It is not known how many suspected Boko Haram members are detained by security forces.

Hundreds were killed last month when leader Abubakar Shekau's fighters stormed the military's main northeastern barracks in Maiduguri, the terror group's birthplace and the headquarters of a year-old military state of emergency to put down the 5-year-old Islamic uprising.

In the video, two of the girls were singled out for questioning.

'Why have you become a Muslim?' one girl, who looked to be in her early teens, was asked.

'The reason why I became a Muslim is 
because the path we are on is not the right path,' the girl said, 
nervously shifting her body from side to side, her eyes darting back and
 forth.

'We should enter the right path so that Allah will be happy with us,' added the girl, who said her name had been changed to Halima because she had converted from Christianity to Islam. Like the other girls, she wore a bulky gray hijab that covered her body from head to toe, revealing only her face.

A second girl, who appeared to be in her mid-teens, was asked if she or any of the others had been mistreated. No, she said, adding that they had experienced nothing 'except righteousness.'

As the girls chanted Islamic verses, some clasped their hands together in what appeared to be the Christian style of prayer before quickly turning their palms upward, as Muslim worshippers do.

The girls' families have said most of those seized April 15 from a school in the northeastern town of Chibok are Christians.

It was impossible to fully authenticate the video, though parents were trying to turn on a generator in Chibok, hoping to watch the video and identify their daughters, said a town leader, Pogu Bitrus.

'There's an atmosphere of hope - hope that these girls are alive, whether they have been forced to convert to Islam or not,' he told The Associated Press by telephone. 'We want to be able to say, "These are our girls."'

The video showed about 100 girls, indicating they may have been broken up into smaller groups as some reports have indicated.

Fifty-three girls managed to escape and 276 remain missing, police say.

Bitrus said vegetation in the video 
looked like the Sambisa Forest, some 20 miles from Chibok, where the 
girls were believed to have been spirited away.

In
 Washington, White House spokesman Jay Carney said U.S. intelligence 
experts were 'combing over every detail' of the latest recording. He 
said administration officials have seen the video and 'have no reason to
 question its authenticity.'

A Nigerian government statement said it was reviewing the video and would 'continue to explore all options for the release and safe return of our girls back to their homes.'

In a video last week, Shekau threatened to sell the girls into slavery.

It arrived amid unverified reports that Christians among the students had been forced to convert to Islam and that some were taken to neighboring Cameroon and Chad, where they were forced to marry their abductors. Boko Haram means 'Western education is sinful.'

The latest video, obtained by The Associated Press, came through channels that have provided previous messages from Shekau, who spoke in the video in the Hausa language of northern Nigeria.

Wearing camouflage fatigues, he clutched
 an assault rifle in the footage, which was imprinted with the Boko 
Haram insignia - a Quran resting on two crossed assault rifles - and 
below a black jihadi flag.

The United States put a $7 million ransom on Shekau last year.

The
 mass abductions and failure of Nigeria's government and military to 
rescue the girls has aroused outrage at home and abroad. Last week, 
Nigeria belatedly accepted offers of help from the United States, 
Britain and other nations.

President
 Goodluck Jonathan's acceptance Sunday of help from Israel, which plans 
to send a counter-terrorism team, has angered some Muslims.

A leading Islamic scholar, Ahmed Mahmud-Gumi, warned in a statement that accepting help from Israel would 'turn Nigeria into another global arena and battlefield for the filthy neocolonial squabbles by interest groups.'

On Saturday he said allowing Western soldiers onto Nigerian soil could make the country a new magnet for foreign Islamic militants who want to confront the United States and others.

The foreign help does not involve boots on the ground but rather experts in intelligence gathering, counter-terrorism and hostage negotiations.

The U.S. team consists of some 30 people drawn from the State and Defense departments, the White House said Monday. Among them are five State Department officials, two strategic communications experts, a civil security expert and a regional medical support officer.

Four FBI officials with expertise in safe recovery, negotiations and preventing future kidnappings are also part of the group.

The Pentagon said 16 Defense Department personnel were on the team, including planners and advisers who were already in Nigeria and have been redirected to assist the government.

French President Francois Hollande invited Jonathan and leaders from neighboring Benin, Chad, Cameroon and Niger, as well as representatives of Britain, the EU and the United States, to a summit on Saturday to focus on Boko Haram, terrorism and insecurity in West Africa.

A French official said Jonathan had agreed to attend. He spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the gathering have not been finalized.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Said Djinnit, his special representative for West Africa, is in Abuja for meetings with the president and other officials on how the United Nations and its member states can help.
