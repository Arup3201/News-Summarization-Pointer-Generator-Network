Marco Pierre White has sold one of his controversial gastro-pubs amid reports it was boycotted by locals and subject to a mass staff walkout.

The celebrity chef bought the Pear Tree Inn in Whitley, Wiltshire in 2011, but quickly came under fire from locals for charging high prices and apparently converting it into a posh London-style eaterie.

Earlier this month, it was also claimed that just a single manager was left at the gastro-pub after a 'mass walkout' by 'frustrated' staff who were fed up with White's allegedly 'bossy' management style.

A spokesman for the venue had claimed the restaurant was only shut for a
 quick refurbishment, despite customers who had booked rooms previously being unexpectedly sent to a nearby hotel.

But the pub has now been sold to new owners, while removal vans have been seen emptying the site. 

A spokeswoman for White told The Telegraph the pub had been sold on Thursday with the new owners due to take over on Friday.

Local councillor Terry Chivers, who has been drinking at the pub for more than 20 years, said: 'What I've been told by a good source is that the lease has been sold.

'Over the last week everything has been removed and the whole place has been gutted.

'All
 the staff have gone and there has been no attempts made to replace 
them. I don't think Marco will be missed in the slightest around here.

Earlier this month, it was claimed just a single manager was left at the gastropub after a mass walkout by 'frustrated' staff. The hotel and restaurant is currently closed for refurbishment

'He came in and made a big deal about supporting the locals but he didn't even have the decency to tell them the Pear Tree was closing.

'He was pig-headed about the whole thing, from the start, he took off all the beers that the locals drank.

'There was such a massive turnover of staff and when you went into the pub you'd never find anyone at the bar to serve you.

'Marco was there all the time in the beginning but when things started to go wrong, he started to walk away. It was probably something of an embarrassment for him.'

A spokesman for the celebrated chef said the pub had been sold on Thursday and that new owners were due to take over on Friday

The chef bought The Pear Tree in March 2011 with business partner Paul Clark as one of six pubs from The Maypole Group which went into administration.

He was quickly criticised for removing all draught lagers from the bar and stocking just one bottled lager costing £4.20 a bottle.

Cider drinkers had to make do with a super strong 7.3 per cent drink, but the menu had more than 40 red wines, with the top bottle costing £139.

Since the chef bought the business in March 2011, he had been criticised for removing all draught lagers and stocking just bottled lager and up to 40 red wines - with the top bottle costing £129

Pub snacks were also removed with 
customers pointed towards the fine-dining menu for food. The eight rooms
 at the hotel cost between £70 and £170 a night.

Earlier
 this month, amid reports of the walkout, manager Duncan de Jager - who 
is now thought to have left - denied the place had lost its staff.

He said the refurbishment would be completed in a 'few weeks'.

Locals say the venue has been gutted. Local councillor Terry Chivers said the lease had been sold and that all the staff had gone

Locals were reportedly upset that the pub had been turned into a fine-dining eatery

But since then, the website for the venue 
has been replaced by a message which says: 'CLOSING FOR THE SUMMER 
PERIOD during which time we will be carrying out re-furbishments'.

It adds that the pub will be reopened at the end of September.

Customers are also still being referred to one of White's other hotels - the nearby Rudloe Arms in Corsham, Wiltshire.

Mr Chivers added: 'I've heard the place is losing £2,000 a week - that's just the rumours though.

'The place should be a goldmine but people aren't going in any more.

'The locals are sick of it. You walk up to the bar and it takes ten to 15 minutes to get served.

'I hope whoever has got it will engage with the locals from the start and get them back into the bar.'

On TripAdvisor, there have been 248 reviews of the business.

Of those, 93 rated The Pear Tree as excellent and 76 said it was very good. There were 36 'average' ratings, 29 'poor' and 14 'terrible'.

The positive comments focused on the 'brilliant' staff and some said the food was 'the best we've ever had'. Those who were unimpressed with the business commented on the lack of atmosphere and the steep prices charged for 'average' food.

A spokeswoman at the nearby Rudloe Arms said nobody was available for comment.

MailOnline tried to contact several agents for the chef but noone was available for comment.
