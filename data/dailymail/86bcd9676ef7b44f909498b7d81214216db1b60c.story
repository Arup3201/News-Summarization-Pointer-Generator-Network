Samsung’s rumoured smartwatch won't need a phone to work - and now patent images have revealed it may not even need a touchscreen.

According to the application filed by the Korean firm, the standalone smartwatch could be controlled using gestures, detected by sensors built into the wrist-worn device.

These sensors could recognise flicks, waves and other movements, and the files claim a depth sensor, when combined with a camera, for example, could be used to detect what a user is pointing at.

According to patent images, pictured, Samsung's standalone smartwatch may include sensors that detect flicks, hand waves, fists and other movements.

Samsung could be on the verge of entering the virtual reality race, if reports about an upcoming headset are true.

The
 Korean firm is said to have sent early prototypes to developers to 
test, and the final product could launch by the end of the year.

Sources close to Samsung told Engadget the headsets have OLED screens and will connect with the next generation of Galaxy devices.

The
 reports suggest the headset will run on Android, rather than the Tizen 
operating system most recently seen on Samsung’s latest smartwatches.

While orientation sensors could be used to unlock the device with a flick of the wrist or open certain apps.

Elsewhere, ambient sounds picked up by the watch’s built-in microphone could add context to a gesture - for example, if using the watch at a gig, a gesture that traditionally switches on the camera could, instead, switch to video mode.

‘A depth sensor may be used in conjunction with an optical camera to enhance display or detection of a device's environment, or to determine which object a user is pointing at or interacting with via a gesture,’ explained the patent.

‘Sensors may include one or more inertial sensors or orientation sensors, such as an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a magnetometer, a GPS chip, or a compass.

The G watch is likely to sync with LG's current range of phones. Earlier this week, patent files revealed a Samsung smartwatch, pictured, that won't need a phone to work. According to the application, the standalone smartwatch could be controlled using gestures, detected by sensors built into the wrist-worn device

Samsung already has four smartwatches on the market, including the Galaxy Gear, pictured left, powered by Google's Android operating system, and the Gear 2, pictured right, powered by Tizen. It is unclear which operating system the standalone smartwatch will run on

‘In particular embodiments, output from sensors may be used to activate or unlock a device, detect one or more gestures, interact with content on the device's display screen or a paired device's display screen.

‘Sensors may include one or more microphones for detecting speech of a user, or ambient sounds to determine the context of the device.’

A number of existing Samsung products, including the Galaxy S5, already feature gesture controls, that let users scroll using hand waves, and sensors that follow where the user is looking.

Its upcoming smartwatch could develop these further.

The G Watch is one of a handful of devices, including the Moto 360, pictured, to take advantage of the modified Android software. The Motorola watch is expected to launch shortly after LG's G watch

The images are part of a wider patent revealed earlier this week that suggest Samsung is developing a smartwatch that doesn’t need a phone to work.

The firm plans to unveil the smartwatch over the next few months in a bid to take a larger slice of the wearable technology market.

The unnamed smartwatch will be able to take photos, send emails, monitor the wearer’s heart rate and use GPS tracking, according to sources close to the company.

Samsung has declined to say what the device will be called, how much it will cost or whether a user will make calls by holding the watch close to his or her mouth.

The patent suggests Samsung's new smartwatch will have a round face resembling Motorola's Android Wear-powered Moto 360.
