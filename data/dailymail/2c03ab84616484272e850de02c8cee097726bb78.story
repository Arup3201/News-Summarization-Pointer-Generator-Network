Argentina fans have mocked stricken Brazil star Neymar after they were filmed celebrating with a spinal chord skeleton.

Coach Alejandro Sabella ignored his country's bitter rivalry with Brazil when he said 'football had shed a tear' after Neymar was ruled out of the World Cup, but it would seem the their fans aren't quite as sympathetic.

Neymar, who has carried Brazil to the semi-finals, suffered a broken vertebrae during the 2-1 quarter-final win against Colombia on Friday and will miss the rest of the tournament.

The Argentina fans have since been filmed waving a spinal column in the air while chanting what seems to be a cheap shot at the Brazilian star's back injury.

Sabella, however, was much more sympathetic, saying: 'When I played football, I was a skilful No 10... so I like to see football played well, and I am delighted by great players.

'When a team loses a player of such great qualities, it's as if football has shed a tear.'

'One feels sad, not just as a coach and but as a spectator,' Sabella added after his side beat Belgium 1-0 to join Brazil in the last four.

'The worst thing that can happen to a player is to get injured, especially at a crucial moment of a World Cup which he has been dreaming about for so long, and working towards for so long.

'So I can well understand the sense of bitterness and of frustration that he must be feeling.

'I'd like to send a hug and say that I am with him in this difficult moment.'
