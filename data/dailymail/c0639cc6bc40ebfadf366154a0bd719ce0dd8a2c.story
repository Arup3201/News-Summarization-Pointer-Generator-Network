Ann Edmead (pictured outside Snaresbrook Crown Court today)  is accused of raping and indecently assaulting the alleged victim between 1973 and 1979

A 72-year-old transsexual has been accused of sexually abusing a schoolboy in the 1970s when she was living as a man.

Ann Edmead, from Bethnal Green, east London, is accused of raping and indecently assaulting the alleged victim between 1973 and 1979, when the boy was aged between 12 and 17.

Edmead appeared frail and trembled when she was asked to stand to enter her pleas at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London today. 

She leaned heavily on her walking stick as she entered the court.  

Edmead had a sex change in 1982 and has written fictional books loosely based on her life story and her upbringing in a children’s home.

She would have been between the ages of 31 and 37 at the time of the alleged offences. 

Judge Neil Sanders told her: ‘I’m sure this doesn't apply in your case, but if you don’t attend on the day of trial a warrant could be issued for your arrest and the trial could commence without you.’

She is accused of three serious sexual offences, one of indecent assault and one of gross indecency.

Her trial is due to start on March 2 next year.
