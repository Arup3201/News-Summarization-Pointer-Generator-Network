Falling fuel prices: Oil fell 3 per cent this morning as Colonel Gaddafi's regime began to crumble

Oil prices fell today as Colonel Gaddafi's regime appeared to be on the verge of collapse after 41 years in power.

The price of Brent Crude oil in London plunged 1.63per cent to $106.85 a barrel this morning.

But there is unlikely to be any respite at the pumps for beleaguered motorists because it takes weeks for the price of fuel to filter through.

The oil markets will be watching carefully with the expectation that a smooth transition of power in Tripoli likely to send prices falling further.

There are hopes that an end to the conflict will see the North African country's oil supplies restored and increase global supplies.

Around 85 per cent of Libyan oil output was exported to Europe until the revolt disrupted the country's production.

European refineries have struggled to make up for the production loss despite an increase from Saudi Arabia.

The average price of unleaded is currently 134.9p per litre for unleaded and 139.1p for diesel, according to PetrolPrices.com.

When protests against Colonel Gaddafi's regime began in February, petrol was six pence cheaper at 128.9p per litre while diesel was 134.3p.

As the conflict escalated, oil prices shot up as the supplies in Libya, the world's 12th largest oil exporter, were heavily restricted.

Last year the country's oilfields were producing 1.65million barrels per day but output has fallen dramatically.

Andrew Lipow, analyst and president 
of consultancy firm Lipow Oil Associates, said oil markets are likely to
 respond with 'a sigh of relief that the conflict has come to the end'.

But he warned that it will take time 
for the market to erase the hefty price increase which resulted from the
 suspension of Libyan oil exports.

The country has oil reserves of 44billion barrels - more than any other country in Africa.

As news filtered through that Gaddafi's 
regime was crumbling, the price of U.S. sweet crude also fell nearly 1 
per cent to $81.48.

Petrol prices have begun to come down from a high of 136.58p a litre on August 8 as the wholesale price of fuel came down.

Last week petrol was 19.22p a litre more expensive than in August 2010 (135.71p compared with 116.49p) while 
diesel was costing 20.91p more (139.89p compared with 118.98p).

That means filling up a typical 50-litre 
petrol car now costs £9.61 more, adding £40.81 to the monthly petrol 
spend of a two-car family. Filling a commercial van's 80-litre tank with
 diesel now costs £16.73 more than 12 months ago.

Despite fresh hope that prices could fall at the pumps in the coming months, the government has 4p per litre fuel duty increases scheduled for January and August 2012.
