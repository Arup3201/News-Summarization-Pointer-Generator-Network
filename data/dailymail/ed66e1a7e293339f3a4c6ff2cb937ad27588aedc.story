The lure of Barcelona was so great that Ivan Rakitic said yes 'quicker than on my wedding day' when offered the opportunity to join the La Liga giants.

Croatia's lynchpin was unveiled as the club's new signing on Tuesday after a £14million move from Sevilla.

Rakitic will wear the No 4 shirt, left vacant by Cesc Fabregas' £30m move to Chelsea last month.

Fact in a figure: Rakitic will wear the No 4 shirt for Luis Enrique's side during the coming season

After a year of stagnancy under Gerardo 
Martino before his eventual sacking, this is the kind of progressive 
capture to be applauded under new boss Luis Enrique.

There remain question marks surrounding the futures of several midfielders, while Fabregas has rocked up at Stamford Bridge, as a minor rebuilding job is well and truly on at the Nou Camp.

Despite failure on three fronts last season, the Catalans arguably remain a bigger drawer than rivals Real Madrid, a notion confirmed by Rakitic.

'When [Sporting director Andoni] Zubizarreta called me I said "yes" as quickly as I did on my wedding day,' the 26-year-old said.

'I can play as defensive midfielder. At every position, you need to understand what the coach wants. I'll try to do the best I can.

'I already talked a bit with Luis Enrique while I was at the World Cup. He's my boss now and it was important to hear from him.'

A recruitment drive is on as Enrique enters his first pre-season in charge, with Liverpool Luis Suarez very much on the club's agenda.

There is a common conception that the Uruguayan's apology for biting Giorgio Chiellini during the win against Italy was engineered by Barcelona, whose image of a well-rounded club could take something of a battering if they were to sign the serial offender.

They certainly aren't shy of talking about the potential new signing, either. Rakitic added: 'To have the character and strength to apologise in front of the world shows what a noble person he is.'
