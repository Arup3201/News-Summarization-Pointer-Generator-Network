Stoke

Stoke are continuing to struggle with injury and illness problems ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash with Arsenal.

Forward Jonathan Walters (knee) and defender Robert Huth (calf) will be given until the last minute to prove their fitness but midfielder Glenn Whelan (calf) is unlikely to make it.

Glenn Whelan (left) has played just 23 minutes for Stoke since the start of October which came during the Potters' 1-0 defeat at Liverpool in November
