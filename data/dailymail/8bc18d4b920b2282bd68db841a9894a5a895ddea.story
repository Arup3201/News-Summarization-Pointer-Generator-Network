Liverpool target Timo Horn says he intends to sign a new deal with Cologne.

The Germany Under 21 international has emerged as a potential signing for Liverpool as they look to increase competition for under-fire goalkeeper Simon Mignolet.

Liverpool have also scouted Loris Karius at Mainz and Norberto Neto of Fiorentina while Stoke's Asmir Begovic and Petr Cech of Chelsea have also been considered.

However, Horn said: 'I have said it more than once: I am in talks with FC Koln [regarding a new contract]. I want to sign on with my club.'

Talking to Cologne-based Express 1 newspaper, his agent, Volker Struth, added: 'We have been told about those rumours. However, no one contacted us directly.'

Horn has played in every Germany youth team from the Under 15 side upwards, but the 21-year-old is yet to feature for the senior side.
