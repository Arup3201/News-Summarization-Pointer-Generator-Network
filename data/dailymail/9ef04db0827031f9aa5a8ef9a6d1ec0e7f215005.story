This dramatic video shows the moment a wild goose chase brought Britain's busiest motorway to a standstill.

A Canada goose injured its wing on the M25 after crash-landing near junction 9, causing chaos as it waddled in a daze along the hard shoulder.

Lorries and cars came so perilously close to colliding with the bird that the Highways Agency imposed a road block, allowing rescuers to safely remove the goose on the loose.

Goose on the loose: The M25 was brought to a standstill after a goose crash-landed on the motorway

Wild goose chase: The road was closed off as rescuers charged down the carriageway, looking for the bird which was unable to take off again because of its injuries

Road block: The drama caused the Highways Agency to shut off the road while the rescue took place

The animal rescue volunteers carried nets as they searched for the bird, but it was too dangerous with traffic roaring past

The goose was spotted wandering next to the hard shoulder of the M25 near junction 9 on October 19

A team from Wildlife Aid UK rushed to the scene to capture the stricken bird, which could not take off because of its damaged wing.

As rescuers arrived, it quickly became apparent that traffic needed to be stopped if they were going to safely catch the goose.

The Highways Agency blocked the road, bringing the section of the M25 to a halt as the pair of Wildlife Aid UK workers, Cristina Flamini and Ron Turner, close in on the goose.

For a moment, the video, shot on October 19, appears to show that the goose has got away, only for it to emerge from a hedge on the motorway's embankment.

After a short struggle through the trees at the side of the road, the rescue team get hold of the bird.

The goose seems safe and well, if a little shaken, as it is carried into a car and taken to a veterinary hospital in Leatherhead, Surrey.

Safe: Wildlife worker Ron Turner clutches the stricken animal as he makes his way back to his car

Found: As soon as the injured goose was caught, the Highways Agency re-opened the motorway carriageway

The goose was taken to a veterinary hospital in Leatherhead, Surrey, where it will stay until it is ready to be released back into the wild

Simon Cowell, who runs Wildlife Aid UK, said: 'It was a miracle that nobody was hurt - either bird or human.

'The Canada goose is being treated for its wounds at the Wildlife Aid Foundation veterinary hospital in Leatherhead and hopefully it will be possible to release the bird back into the wild in due course.'  

The charity deals with 20,000 wildlife incidents every year.
