A pet's name is the most common online password, researchers say, as they warn our accounts are too easy to hack.

A study found that despite half of Britons knowing someone whose online account has been compromised, many are still leaving the door wide open to hackers.

One is six Britons admit accessing someone else's account by guessing the password, with partners the most common target, followed by ex’s.

As many as one in six people use their pet's name as a password. The next most popular password choice is a significant date such as wedding anniversary

One in ten people has also guessed a work colleague's password, the study by Google Apps found.

As many as one in six people uses their pet's name as a password.

The next most popular password choice is a significant date such as wedding anniversary.

One in ten people uses a child's name, nine per cent the date of birth of a close relative, and eight per cent another family member's name.

Three per cent still use 'password' as their password.

Despite the comparative ease for hackers, 67 per cent of us only change passwords when we have to.

Nearly half of us also write our passwords down, with three per cent opting for a note on their desk

The poll of 2,000 people also found that nearly a half of us have shared a password with someone else.

Women are more likely to share their password than men - and over twice as likely to share it with their child.

Nearly half of us also write our passwords down, with three per cent opting for a note on their desk.

Experts warn that in 2013 one in five people admit to having clicked on spam links, and only 41 per cent have updated their antivirus software.

Despite half of Britons knowing someone whose online account has been compromised, many are still leaving the door wide open to hackers

Almost one in five people has left their computer without logging out of a service, with one in seven Brits taking advantage of this lax approach to online security and perusing their partner's emails.

Eran Feigenbaum, Director of Security, Google Apps said: ‘People often leave their information open to online security breaches without even realising it.

‘Lax attitudes to online security can lead to serious consequences if strangers access your information.

‘Simple steps such as choosing more complicated passwords, always logging out of services and considering two-factor authentication, which requires more than just a password to access your account, can make a real difference to your security online.’
