Five years after a gunman forced five women into the back of a Chicago clothing store and shot them dead execution-style, police are still searching for answers.

Authorities have received 6,700 tips about the 2008 killings at the Lane Bryant store in Tinley Park, but they are no closer to knowing who took the women's lives - or why.

Store manager Rhoda McFarland, 42, Jennifer Bishop, 34, Carrie Hudek Chiuso, 33, Sarah Szafranski, 22, and Connie Woolfolk, 37, died in the grisly shootings on February 2, 2008.

Shortly after 10 a.m., a man posing as a 
delivery man walked into the store and chatted with two 
customers and two employees. He then pulled out a gun and 
announced a holdup.

He forced the four women into the back room of the store, bound them 
with duct tape and forced them face down on the floor, police said.

Two more women 
who later entered the store were also taken into the back room, tied and forced next to the others.

When the gunman was distracted, store manager Rhoda McFarland managed to call 911 from her cell phone even though she was bound by duct tape.

Dispatchers logged the call at 10.44 a.m. and heard her frantically describing what was happening. On the call, the man could also be heard saying: 'I'm losing it.'

Loss: Jennifer L. Bishop, 34, (left) and Sarah Szafranski, 22, (right) were also marched into the back room of the store and shot execution style by the gunman who has never been caught

He then shot the six women execution style, fatally shooting five. The sixth victim pretended to be dead until police arrived a few minutes later.

By the time authorities arrived on the scene, the man had fled. He left bullet casings from a .40-caliber Glock behind, but took the gun with him.

The one survivor was able to describe him in detail as he had not been wearing a mask. She said he was  a 6 foot African-American
man with braided hair and 
cornrows, and aged between 25 and 35.

She noted that his hair was pulled back but that one braid hung by his right cheek with light-green beads on the end of it.

The woman did not recognise the man and investigators did not find a connection between him and any of the other victims.

Wanted: A sixth victim survived the shooting by pretending to be dead and described the gunman to police. Investigators created this image to show their suspect, but he has not been found

Authorities believe the killings could have been motivated by robbery as he took a few hundred dollars from the store, but they have not been able to confirm this.

Today, three investigators work on the case full time and
tips keep coming in - although they are becoming less frequent. In 
2008, there were 5,600 calls while there were just 87 last year.

Investigators have followed leads as far afield as Texas, North Carolina and London, but nothing has helped solve the crime, and there were no security cameras in the store to assist police.

With specialist training courses and help from agencies including NASA, the police department in Tinley has spent nearly $2 million trying to find the killer.

'There is somebody out there who knows who did this,'  Cmdr. Pat McCain told the Chicago Tribune.

'Maybe their 
conscience is bothering them. Maybe they will get themselves in a jam 
and need to help themselves out. I don't care what their motivation is. 
We need them to come forward.'

But not all family members are seeking such closure. Jennifer Bishop's sister Michelle Talos said she fears the pain that would follow an arrest.

'We would all have to go through all that again,' she said. 'Sometimes, I would like to just imagine that he's dead somewhere.'

On Saturday, family members will gather outside the store, which has been empty since the murders, to remember their loved ones.

Store manager Rhoda McFarland was scheduled to be off on the day of the killings, but had stopped by the shop to help with markdowns.

Site: The shop, at Brookside Marketplace Mall, is now being renovated for new tenants

Jennifer Bishop, 34, was enjoying a weekend away from home with her husband when she nipped into the shop, which specialised in clothes for plus-size women, and unsuspectingly became a victim.

Carrie Hudek Chiuso, 33, was shopping for an outfit for a get-together with old college friends, while mother-of-two Connie Woolfolk, 37, was looking for new clothes for a girls' night out that evening.

Sarah Szafranski, 22, visited the shop to buy some winter work clothes for her new job in the accounting 
department at CNA Financial in downtown Chicago.

The site is now being remodelled for a new tenant.
