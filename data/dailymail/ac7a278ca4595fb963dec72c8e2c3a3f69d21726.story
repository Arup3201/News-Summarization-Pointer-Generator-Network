Countless cyclists have been injured - or even killed - after falling victim to a driver's blind spot, but a new  light could help put an end to this.

Laserlight projects an icon onto the road, helping to ensure that drivers are aware of an approaching cyclist, even if they cannot see them.

The green image is beamed between 16 and 19ft (five and six metres) in front of a cyclist, signalling that a driver should not turn across their path.

According to the maker's website, the 'classic blind spot scenario' is the number one danger to cyclists.

London-based Blaze claim that just under 80 per cent of cycle accidents occur when a bicycle is travelling straight and a vehicle manoeuvres into them.

According to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (Rospa), 19,438 British cyclists were involved in accidents last year - and of those 109 died. 

Rospa says that the most dangerous hours for cyclists are between 3pm and 6pm as well as 8am and 9am on weekdays. However, cycling accidents in the dark are more likely to be fatal.

Around 75 per cent of fatal or serious cyclist accidents occur in urban areas and 75 per cent happen at, or near, a road junction

The rechargable Laserlight, they say, works to provide a bigger 'footprint' on the road for the cyclist. 

The Laserlight also works as a normal white LED front light - throwing out more than 300 lumens in its brightest mode.

Works as both a traditional 300 lumen bike light and a warning laser light 

Cost: £125; $200; €125

Outer casing: Aluminium

Power: Charges using USB cable 

Weight: 6.4oz (182g)

Waterproof up to 3ft (1m) deep

Run time: Up to 13 hours with and laser both flashing 

The signature laser image is projected by a separate diode inside the light and can be switched on and off independently.

Its makers explained that the icon is green because the human eye is most receptive to light on that wavelength. 

It also takes relatively little energy to generate green light, resulting in the Laserlight’s impressive run times - 13 hours with light and laser both flashing. 

The bicycle projection is visible in daylight, but is designed for use in low light when a cyclist would usually use their lights. In the UK, this makes up approximately 50 per cent of commuting hours.

It is available to buy, costing £125 in the UK, $200 in the U.S. and €125 across the rest of Europe.
