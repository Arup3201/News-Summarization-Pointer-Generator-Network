President Obama will welcome the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall to the White House when the royal couple visit America next month.

Mr Obama will sit down to informal talks with Charles and Camilla in his famous Oval office and will be joined by his vice president Joe Biden.

The prince last met the president in May 2011, a few days after the royal wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the world leader confessed the glittering occasion had left America mesmerised.

Going to America: Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall will visit the US next month

'The Prince and The Duchess will visit the United States  to engage in activities to promote the United Kingdom’s partnership with the United States,' said the White House in a statement.

'While in Washington, The Prince and The Duchess will also visit Mt. Vernon, the Armed Forces Retirement Home, and the National Archives.

'This visit underscores the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom.'

Charles, who will be visiting the country for the 22nd time, and Camilla are travelling at the request of the British government and will meet President Obama during the four-day tour.

The visit, which comes less than four months after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's trip to New York, is to mark a series of major milestones in American history.

Foremost among them is the 150th anniversary of the American Civil War and the 150th anniversary  of President Abraham Lincoln's death.

Lincoln, who led the Union side during the bloody four-year conflict, was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathiser, as he left a Washington D.C theatre on 15th April 1865.

Third time: March's four-day trip is the third time that the royal pair will have visited as a couple

First trip: Their first overseas trip following their 2005 wedding was to the United States

Meeting: This trip will see Charles and Camilla meet President Obama in the Oval Office

Along with meeting President Obama and marking US anniversaries, Charles will celebrate a very British one during a trip to the National Archives in the American capital.

While visiting Washington D.C, he will be shown a rare 1297 copy of the Magna Carta, made 82 years after the original was signed by King John at Runnymede.

The first Magna Carta, which celebrates its 800th birthday this year, is considered the foundation of British democracy and represents the first time any monarch had limitations placed on their powers.

Under its terms, the monarch was bound to protect the rights of the church and the barons, deliver swift justice and limit the amount he or she could demand in taxes.

Rewritten and reissued a further three times, the 1297 version was proclaimed by Edward I, the famous Hammer of the Scots, who did so in exchange for extra tax-raising powers.

The declaration, made to provide funds for Edward's conquest of Scotland and Wales, remains part of British law today, with the 1297 charter still on the statute books. 

Meeting: During their 2005 trip, the couple met then President George W. Bush and his wife Laura

Whirlwind: That trip also included a visit to San Francisco where Charles met the California Highway Patrol

Back to Britain: The tour was considered a success, with US Press describing them as being 'down-to-earth'

But the four-day visit isn't entirely about historical anniversaries, with Clarence House saying in a statement that the focus will also be on 'sustainability and climate change, creating youth opportunities, encouraging corporate social responsibility and promoting cultural links'.

The trip will begin in Louisville, the birthplace of boxer Muhammad Ali, where the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall will meet local people and visit a series of community projects.

Next on the itinerary is Washington D.C, where the royal couple will visit the Armed Forces Retirement Home, which occupies same grounds as the Lincoln Cottage.

President Lincoln is believed to have written the final draft of the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, which universally freed all American slaves, while living there.

The Retirement Home, the US equivalent of the Royal Hospital Chelsea, is the oldest home for veterans in the US and has occupied the site since 1851.

During their tour, the royal couple, both of whom hold honorary military titles, will meet veterans from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coastguard.

Another historical stop on the tour is at Mount Vernon, which was the home of George Washington, who presided over the convention that drafted the US Constitution.

The timber-framed house, in Fairfax County, Virginia, is perched on the Potomac River and has been in the Washington family since 1674.

Contemporary issues will also get an airing, not least when Charles makes an appearance at the International Conservation Caucus Foundation, during which he is to be honoured with an award.

While Charles gets to grips with one of his favourite causes at the ICCF, the Duchess of Cornwall will be meeting rape and sexual assault victims in Washington.

The Duchess, who is passionate about improving the lot of sexual abuse survivors, will join an meeting of the District of Columbia’s Sexual Assault Response Team.

On their final day, the couple will return to Louisville, where Prince Charles will make the keynote address at a symposium on health.

Return trip: A year after his infamous visit to Las Vegas, Prince Harry was back in the US and in Colorado

Inspiration: During the visit, he attended the Warrior Games which inspired the Invictus Games a year later

Getting involved: True to form,  Harry also took part in a human pyramid with UK and US military officials

Meanwhile, Camilla will visit a food literacy project for young people at a local farm, which aims to give youngsters the chance to experience farm life and better understand the connection between food and farming. 

The US has a long history of receiving royal visitors, beginning in 1939 when George VI and the Queen Mother met President Franklin Roosevelt at the White House.

Next to visit was the Queen, who made her first trip in 1957 and used it to visit Washington and New York, with a brief stop to take in an American football game between Maryland and North Carolina.

Charles made his first official visit in 1985 when, with then-wife Princess Diana, he joined President Ronald Regan and a cast of A-listers for a gala dinner at the White House.

More recent visits include the Cambridge's trip to New York last month and to LA in July 2011, as well as Prince Harry's infamous trip to Las Vegas in August 2012. 

Harry returned to the US the following year, this time for an incident-free trip marked by his attendance at the Warrior Games.
