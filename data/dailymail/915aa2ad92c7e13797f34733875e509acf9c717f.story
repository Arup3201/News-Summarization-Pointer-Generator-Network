The NFL announced some major changes to their performance-enhancing drug policy earlier today that will likely have a huge impact on the league's players.

Under the new rules, players who test positive for banned stimulants during the offseason will not be suspended once regular season play commences, and will instead be referred to a substance abuse program.

The league will also begin testing for human growth hormone starting next month.

The NFL also lifted three players' suspensions under this new policy, among them Denver Broncos star and former New England Patriot Wes Welker, who tested positive for amphetamine during the offseason.

A source told CBS Sports this was due to the wide receiver's usage of Adderall during the Kentucky Derby.

He and the two other suspended players, Dallas Cowboys defensive back Orlando Scandrick and St. Louis Rams wide receiver Stedman Bailey, will return to the field this weekend, having sat out just two games of their four-game suspension.

The league and union are also nearing an agreement on changes to the substance abuse policy. 

This new policy does get strict when it comes to some penalties however, laying out much harsher suspensions for players who test positive for any banned substance or stimulant during the season.

According to CBS News, use of a diuretic or masking agent will result in a two-game suspension, steroids, in-season use of stimulants, HGH and other banned substances gets a player a four-game suspension, and any evidence of an attempt to manipulate a test is a six-game suspension.

Second violations will result in a 10-game ban, and a third violation is at least a two-year suspension.

This all comes as the league is under heavy scrutiny in the wake of two abuse scandals involving stars Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson.

Many are upset with the punishments these two received, feeling the NFL was too lenient.

Video of Rice punching then-fiancée Janay Palmer went public last Monday, and Peterson was indicted on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child on Friday for an incident in which he hit his son with a switch back in May.

Rice has been indefinitely suspended from the NFL and had his contract terminated by the Baltimore Ravens, while Peterson, who was sidelined by the Minnesota Vikings last Sunday, has now been suspended by the team.
