Amateur video-camera footage has captured how a quick-thinking
firefighter came to the rescue of 7-year-old Jane Richard in
the terror attack which killed her brother Martin.

Off-duty Matt Patterson wearing a red t-shirt is seen rushing to the aid of the little
girl, who lost a leg in the attack and remains hospitalized in a critical condition.

Jane is seen sitting up and then lying in the middle of the road, moments after standing on the sidelines where she was photographed alongside her brother Martin.

The photograph reveals how the siblings were standing just yards from terror suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. 

Following the bomb attack others are filmed standing around stunned but Patterson leaps into action.

Just before the explosion he had been enjoying a meal with his girlfriend in a nearby restaurant.

'This child for some reason just jumped at me - it was tunnel vision,' he said.

'I could see the damage. I could see that she needed a tourniquet. She needed surgery, it was obvious from what I saw.'

'I go up to a business guy and ask for his belt, he hands it over without hesitation. I have to stop the bleeding. I am making the tourniquet and another man comes and I ask him to hold it for pressure. I'm looking up and down the street - looking for where I can bring the child to an ambulance or more care.'

Patterson and the other man ran with Jane to a waiting ambulance. She has lost a leg and remains in a critical condition in hospital but is expected to survive her injuries.

Yesterday it emerged she is an enthusiastic Irish dancer having attended classes at the 
Clifden Academy of Irish Dance in Milton since the age of three.

Several Irish dance groups are now raising money to support her.

'She is just a beautiful little girl.
 We taught her since she was a baby, pointing her little toe,' Eileen 
Dillon Dinn, owner of the Clifton Academy, told the Irish Voice.

'We are just in a state of shock and 
disbelief. The Richard family is lovely. They went to the marathon as a 
happy family, and then this happened. We don’t know what to say.'

Jane loved to learn all the new moves
 at the academy, according to her teacher, and was on the sidelines at 
the recent Irish World Dance Championships in Boston - dreaming that 
someday she would get the chance to compete.

'She’s a beauty, always smiling,' said Dillon Dinn. 'Jane really lives to dance.'

Her eldest brother Henry, 
12, and father Bill managed to escape from the bomb attack uninjured.

Images from the scene appear to show 
Bill, 42, a community organizer, holding his youngest children up on the railings.

Their mother school librarian Denise, 43, sustained head injuries and had to undergo brain surgery following the attack.

Yesterday, the family laid Martin to rest.

In a statement they said: 'The
 outpouring of love and support over the last week has been tremendous. 
This has been the most difficult week of our lives and we appreciate 
that our friends and family have given us space to grieve and heal.'

'A
 private Funeral Mass was celebrated this morning with immediate family.
 We laid our son Martin to rest, and he is now at peace. We plan to 
have a public memorial service in the coming weeks to allow friends and 
loved ones from our community to join us for a celebration of Martin’s 
life.'

The Children's Hospital of Boston did not identify the seven-year-old girl they said was still in a critical condition. However,
 previous reports of the injured suggest Jane is the only 
one of 11 youngsters injured in the terror attacks that fits the 
sparse description.

Victims: From left, Martin Richards, eight, Krystal Campbell, 29, and Lu Lingxi, 23, were the three people killed in the explosions which tore through spectators at the Boston Marathon last Monday

The family were on a day out to watch elated runners cross the finish line.

Bill
 is a former marathon runner himself so the young family liked to 
support other participants in the event, according to friends of the 
family.

Neighbors said Jane looked up to her 
older brother and they both attended the Neighborhood House Charter 
School in Dorchester, where their mother works as the school librarian.

Tracey Monroe also came to Jane's aid in the moments after the blast.

She told WCVB.com: 'I saw her laying in the street. I held her head in my hands 
and I tried to rub her and comfort her. I asked what her name was and 
she said Jane.

'She 
was just a baby and so badly injured and scared. But she was so 
incredibly brave. I saw him [Martin] and at that point I knew he was 
gone. I'll never forget them - that little girl, she was so brave.'

Tsarnaev,
 whose older brother and suspected accomplice Tamerlan Tsarnaev was 
killed in the manhunt to track the bombers down, has been charged with 
using a weapon of mass destruction against persons or property. 

The
 bombing killed three and injured more than 200, 48 of 
whom were still in hospital yesterday, three in a critical condition, 
according to Reuters.

At least 14 people lost all or part of a limb and three of them lost more than one.

But doctors say every one of the people injured in the blasts seem likely to survive.

Patterson added: 'Why would you hurt innocent children - what does that prove? I'm happy she's ok and I got word she's recovering as good as she can.'

Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick has visited the Richard family.

'I think they know that there’s a lot of love and concern for them out in the community,' Patrick said.

'I hope they do and I hope they find some strength in that.'
