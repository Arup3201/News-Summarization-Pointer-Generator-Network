A Chinese social media user uploaded a picture showing a young man riding a motorcycle with no less than five passengers on the back.

The 'six-person motorbike' was seen by a local man You Hou while he was driving down the streets of the city of Fuzhou in south-eastern China's Fujian Province.

Posting the images he said: 'I was driving home from work with as friend when the motorcycle rode past.

Crazy: A Chinese social media user uploaded this picture of a motorcycle with six people on it

'The bike was going at 31 mph, but looked incredibly dangerous.

'The young man riding the bike was seated at the very front, with four other men and women sitting behind him, and the last person standing at the back.

'I know that there are some pretty unsafe vehicles on the road but I challenge anyone to come up with something like that, outside of a circus stunt riding team.'

He was backed by other netizens, the name for the Chinese social media users, who not only slammed the bike riders for putting their lives and the lives of others at risk, but also criticised police who they said should have been looking out for such dangerous stunts.

One, WangHou05, wrote: 'I travel that route every day and there must be one hundred CCTV cameras up there. One wonders what they are for if it isn't to put a stop to people carrying out stunts like this?'

Fatal road accidents are a serious problem in China, where the highway network and number of new drivers are expanding rapidly while traffic laws and safety are widely flouted.

The ministry of transport says the number of road deaths in China fell from 104,000 in 2003 to 60,000 in 2012, or from about 300 fatalities a day to less than 200.

A study published in 2011 by a group of Chinese and US researchers concluded, however, that the number of deadly accidents was two times higher than the police claimed.
