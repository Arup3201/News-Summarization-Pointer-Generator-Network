Fights between football hooligans tend to be in the heat of the moment with little love lost between the two sets of fans. 

So a bizarre video showing 76 Russian hooligans beating each other senseless and then hugging and shaking hands at the end has understandably gone viral.

The four-minute clip, which has more than 70,000 hits since being posted on Sunday, shows fans from Moscow-based clubs Spartak and Dynamo meeting on a deserted highway near the Russian capital for the mass punch up.

Scroll down for video. 

Fans from Moscow clubs Spartak and Dynamo meet on a deserted highway near the Russian capital for the arranged mass punch up

The fans arrive for the arranged 'fixture' between the two Moscow clubs Spartak and Dynamo who are presently eighth and fifth respectively in the Russian Premier League

Each 'team' has 38 players and no quarter is shown or expected as the fans clash in a flurry of footwork and punches in the snow

Thirty-eight people on both sides launch themselves at each other in a bloody barrage of flailing fists.

In one scene, a Dynamo fan dressed in grey is seen punching a Spartak fan as he lies on the floor in pool of blood.

He is then kicked in the head several times.

'Come and have a go if you think you're hard enough': The fans taunt their opponents as they arrive for the fight on a deserted road near the Russian capital

As the mass brawl continues bodies are seen lying strewn across the snow-covered road and in ditches.

The fight ends with one of the cameramen shouting 'That's it' and to the cheers of the winning side Dynamo.

It's all over and the rival fans go to help those who have fallen. It's brutal and violent but none of the fans seem to take it personally

One fan said: 'We fight before every game between Spartak and Dynamo – we support our teams. This was not a very serious fight, next time we will fight with sticks as well until we are even more bloody'

The Dynamo hooligans are then seen helping their victims to their feet and giving them hugs. One is even heard saying: 'Thank you for the fight'

One of the participating fans Denis Tsarev told local media that the fight had been arranged and the two sides were hoping to have a bloodier battle next time
