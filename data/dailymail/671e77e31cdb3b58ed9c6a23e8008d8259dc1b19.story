'People used to ask, when are you getting married?' Shelly Crocker says, leaning across the table at a north Seattle donut shop next to her wife, Sandy Kibort, and their daughter, Emma Kibort-Crocker.

'I always told them, "Well, the entire state of Washington has to vote on it first."'

Ms Crocker and Ms Kibort got that nod in November. Two months after Washington voters approved Referendum 74, the couple were legally wed in their synagogue.

High school sweethearts originally from 
Minneapolis, Ms Kibort and Ms Crocker had first been joined in a commitment 
ceremony in 1984, but waited to legally marry until they could do so in 
their own state.

That's a trend among same-sex couples, 
says Kirsten Ott Palladino, the Atlanta-based co-founder and editor in 
chief of EquallyWed.com, an online magazine devoted to same-sex 
weddings.

'As more states are legally recognizing same-sex marriage, couples are choosing to wait to marry in their home states,' says Ms Palladino. 'We're not seeing as many people flying to Massachusetts or New York for their big weddings.'

Ms Palladino also cites a growing interest in incorporating religion into same-sex ceremonies, as Ms Crocker and Ms Kibort did.

'For a time, there was a backlash against including religion in same-sex weddings. Now couples seem proud to put religion and cultural traditions back into their ceremonies,' says Ms Palladino.

There's more freedom these days to choose a wedding that reflects a couple's relationship and budget, according to Steven Petrow, author of Steven Petrow's Complete Gay & Lesbian Manners.

This generation of gays and lesbians is creating a new set of rites and rituals incorporating both old and new traditions, says Mr Petrow, who lives in Hillsborough, North Carolina, a state that doesn't allow same-sex marriage.

'The maid of honor might be a man or the
best man may be a woman. And honored attendants are 
often a mix of close friends and family'

He cites one new tradition of sending the rings around to be blessed by all those in attendance. 'It's like a metaphor for a group hug,' says Mr Petrow. 'It's incredibly moving.'

Today's same-sex couples often go with non-traditional wedding party configurations.

'The maid of honor might be a man or the best man may be a woman,' Mr Petrow says. 'And honored attendants are often a mix of close friends and family.'

Often the couple walk down the aisle together, 'or if they have kids, the whole family may process,' he says.

Ms Crocker and Ms Kibort sent their two adult daughters, Emma and Hannah Kibort-Crocker, down the aisle before them.

Bringing back traditions: Now that gay marriage is becoming more mainstream, there is a growing interest in incorporating religion into same-sex ceremonies, as Ms Crocker and Ms Kibort did

'It was a very family wedding,' says Ms 
Kibort. 'My kids pulled a prank on me in the middle of the ceremony and 
it was a crackup. Everyone was laughing.'

Like these two women, many same-sex couples tying the knot are in mid-life, and have well-established relationships and children. While their parents may be given honored roles in the ceremony or reception, such as the first dance, many couples are planning and paying their own way.

It remains to be seen how younger 
same-sex couples will structure their weddings as they marry earlier in 
life.

'My kids pulled a prank on me in the middle of the ceremony and 
it was a crackup. Everyone was laughing'

Mr Petrow notes that while his generation of gays and lesbians had
no expectation of getting married, today's kids are growing up 
expecting to have the choice.

And
just because they have the right to marry doesn't mean a couple will 
choose to do so. 'It's impolite to hassle people - gay or straight - 
about getting married,' he says.

It is acceptable, he says, to ask how a same-sex couple who are getting married would like to be described.

While many choose 'husband and husband' 
or 'wife and wife,' he says it's a matter of respect to call them as 
they want. Listen to how they refer to themselves, and follow their 
lead.

Bigger issues at stake: 'We didn't want it to be a political event,' said Ms Crocker of their wedding (pictured). 'But [it] was bigger than us,' Ms Kibort says. 'It's a civil rights issue'

'Until five years ago, the standard title was "partner,"' says Mr Petrow. 'That's really changed.'

While many same-sex weddings are 
apolitical, many other couples are passionate about politics and choose 
to include it in their weddings, says Ms Palladino.

Ms
Crocker and Ms Kibort included a reminder of their newly gained right 
by involving Seattle gay rights activist, former judge and former Deputy
Mayor Anne Levinson in their ceremony, alongside Rabbi Jill Borodin.

'We didn't want it to be a political event. It's a wedding,' says Ms Crocker.

'We didn't want it to be a political event. It's a wedding . . . You're being asked to show up and love a member of your family'

'But our wedding was bigger than us,' Ms Kibort says. 'It's a civil rights issue.'

While political undertones are often present in same-sex ceremonies, Mr Petrow reminds guests, 'You're not being asked to vote for gay marriage by choosing to attend a wedding. You're being asked to show up and love a member of your family.'

Guests should decline to attend if they can't support the couple's relationship, he added. 'Same-sex weddings, like straight weddings, are at their heart about love and commitment. If you can't honor the couple, please stay home.'

Ms Crocker and Ms Kibort even bristle at the term 'gay marriage.'

'I don't gay park. I don't have gay lunch,' says Ms Kibort. 'You don't say you're going to an interracial marriage. It isn't a gay marriage. It's a marriage.'
