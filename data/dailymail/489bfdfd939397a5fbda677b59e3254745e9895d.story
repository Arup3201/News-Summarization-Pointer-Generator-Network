A rip-off that cheats pensioners of £1billion in vital income is to be investigated by watchdogs.

It is thought that 400,000 people a year are being denied up to £50,000 throughout their retirement.

Yesterday – following a campaign by Money Mail – the Financial Services Authority announced it had launched an investigation into the scandal.

The worst affected are the sick, smokers and the terminally ill who are being short-changed by insurers.

Industry figures show six in ten over-55s should qualify for bigger pensions due to poor health but just two in ten claim them.

The probe centres around annuities, which many people live off when they retire. The FSA says pensioners are losing out because they are not told what they are entitled to.

On retirement most people turn their savings into a regular income for life, by buying an annuity.

What they receive each year depends largely on how long they are expected to live. The shorter someone’s life expectancy the more they should get because the ‘pension pot’ they have saved for all their life is being spread over a shorter period.

Conversely a healthy person expected to live for many years would receive less because their ‘pot’ has to last much longer.

Generally, those in poor health – a smoker or a diabetic – should get more. But they miss out because insurers encourage them to accept an average payout instead, which is usually meant for someone who is of perfect health.

It means someone with a pot worth £100,000 would get a boost of £2,000 a year. This would be worth up to £50,000 over the course of a 25-year retirement.

Industry figures show six in ten over-55s should qualify for bigger pensions due to poor health. But just two in ten people claim them.

‘The way pensioners are deprived of money they have spent their whole lives saving is an absolute scandal,’ said Ros Altmann, director-general of Saga. ‘There must be some obligation on these companies to treat their customers fairly and ensure they don’t spend their retirement in poverty.’

The National Association of Pension Funds estimates the scandal is depriving the elderly of an estimated £1billion a year in much needed income.

Joanne Segars, chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds, said: ‘Greater transparency in this market is essential if people are to have faith in pensions.

‘At the moment, consumers are dealing with an unfair and opaque system that is preventing too many of them from securing a decent income for their old age. People need to know that they can turn their savings pots into a good amount of income when they purchase an annuity.’

Also hit are widows who, in the most shocking cases, are left penniless because their husbands were convinced to sign up to a deal that died with them.

This is because the standard incomes offered by insurers cover just a single person.

When that individual dies, their pension dies with them.

Married retirees can get an income which would keep paying money to their loved one when they die. Yet insurers again fail to make this clear.

Every year thousands of women are left penniless because their husbands die before them and they have no pension of their own.

The £1billion scandal is being compounded by huge falls in pensions caused by the Bank of England’s policy of printing more money, known as Quantitative Easing.

Misleading pension deals have cost the elderly up to £1billion a year in lost income

This has caused rates on annuities to plunge by more than a fifth in three years, stripping £1,418 a year from a £100,000 pension.

Last year, the Association of British Insurers announced it would launch a code of practice to ensure pensioners shopped around to get better incomes.

But as part of its Get Britain Saving campaign Money Mail demanded an independent review by the Financial Services Authority after it exposed loopholes in the code.

Yesterday, the watchdog announced it would probe the way pensioners took an income from their savings.

Nick Poyntz-Wright, head of life insurance at the FSA, said: ‘An annuity purchase is an important one-off decision that has long term consequences for individuals if they get it wrong.

‘We want to understand the level of the potential detriment for consumers if they do not shop around, to see if there are ways to make this market work better for consumers.’

The results of the review will be published later this year.

Billy Burrows, an independent financial adviser at Better Retirement Group, said: ‘Insurers are making improvements but there are still pockets of sharp practice and it’s right that the firms responsible come under closer scrutiny from the FSA.’

Stephen Gay, director of life, savings and protection, at the Association of British Insurers, said: ‘Any review of annuities would be timely.

‘The market is changing with ABI initiatives set to provide people approaching retirement with greater clarity and confidence as they prepare for retirement, and we are pleased that the FSA recognises this.’

Annuity rates are unlikely to rise for some time because the incoming governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has intimated he intends to carry on printing money, believing it to be the most effective way to kick start the economy out of a possible triple-dip recession.
