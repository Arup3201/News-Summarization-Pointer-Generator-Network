At first glance, these pictures look like they depict a network of fields stretching to the horizon.

But in fact, the extraordinary images show an area of Spain as large as the Isle of Wight, totally covered in greenhouses.

The fruit and vegetables grown in the futuristic-looking structures end up on tables in Britain and elsewhere.

Breathtaking: These greenhouses in southern Spain cover an area of 100,000 acres, which is as large as the Isle of Wight

Transformation: The light-coloured tents reflect the sun, meaning that the average temperature in the area has fallen

The greenhouses have had such an impact on the area of Almeria in the south of the country that they have lowered the average temperature by reflecting away light.

However, for workers inside there is no such respite - they must struggle to labour through 45-degree heat for just £30 a day.

The area photographed covers nearly 100,000 acres, and the facilities are continuing to spread along the Mediterranean coast.

Lethal: Immigrants working in the facilities must contend with temperatures of up to 45C

Swamped: Some towns have been almost entirely overtaken by the ever-growing sea of greenhouses

Fifty years ago, the land was so barren that it was used to film 'spaghetti westerns' wanting to replicate the look of American deserts.

But with imported soil and hydroponic systems that drip-feed chemical fertilisers into grow-bags, the area now has the largest collection of greenhouses in the world.

Many Spanish workers find it too hot to work there, so most of the staff are immigrants from Africa and Eastern Europe - either legal or illegal.

Barren: The landscape was once used to film spaghetti westerns because it was so desert-like

Around 100,000 immigrants are believed to work in the facilities, and their low wages and lack of rights are thought to help the businesses remain profitable.

Many of the 'farms' have no toilets, and workers are believed to be paid between €33 and €36 a day - no more than around £30.

A few small towns in the area have been completely swamped by the white plastic farms.

Lucrative: The exports of food from the region were worth 1.4billion euros in the first quarter of last year alone

Plastic manufacturers and recycling companies have also set up in the region, where discarded plastic sheeting and rubbish is blown around by the wind.

Last month the death of a sperm whale that washed up on Spain's south coast was linked to the Almeria greenhouses after it was found to have swallowed 37lb (17kg) of plastic waste dumped into the sea.

In the first quarter of 2012 food exports from Almeria, including lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, watermelons and peppers, were valued at €1.4billion.
