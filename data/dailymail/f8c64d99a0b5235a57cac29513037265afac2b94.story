It has been three years years since Baby Lisa was snatched from her crib in the middle of the night.

But parents Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin still keep their baby daughter's room exactly how it looked the night she disappeared from their suburban home in Kansas City, Missouri.

'Her room is so full of toys you can hardly walk in there,' Deborah told The Kansas City Star.

Next month,Deborah and Jeremy will celebrate Lisa's fourth birthday with a cake and presents.

'It just gets harder,' Deborah, who also has two sons, told The Star. 'We try the best we can to function, to care for our boys and wait for her to come home.'

Despite all the heartache, Deborah and Jeremy remain strong in searching for and hoping that Baby Lisa will return

The mother 
tucked her 10-month-old baby into her crib and put her to sleep on Oct. 
4., 2011. The father came back home a few hours later to a shocking 
discovery — their tiny baby girl was missing.

Local
 officials — from detectives to search parties on horseback — tracked 
down thousands of leads, hunting for Baby Lisa in open fields, vacant 
lots, wells and just about anywhere they could go. 

The
 distraught parents had been on national television to plea for help 
finding their daughter. One benefactor even offered $100,000 for 
information leading to the girl's safe return.

But gradually, the tips slowed down to a trickle. Police received 100 tips in the last year.

The parents' attorney, John Picerno, said police are still re lacking 'substantial, concrete leads,' according to The Star.

But Bradley and Irwin are yet to give up.

'If
 you see something, please call the police,' Deborah told The Star. 'Keep your 
eyes open. It only takes one sighting to bring her home.'

The parents' nightmare began in the early hours of Oct. 4, 2011. News of Lisa’s abduction exploded into the small north Kansas neighborhood.

Officers hammered on neighbors’ doors, an Amber alert went out, posters were swiftly printed and a hotline set up. A handful of sightings went nowhere.

The couple became the subject of intense scrutiny. Deborah initially stated she had checked on baby Lisa around 10.40pm.

Later she wasn’t so certain that she had checked on the infant who was recovering from a cold and fever, after putting her down earlier than usual close to 6.30pm.

An electrician, Jeremy was working a night shift. He came home around 4am to a house in some disarray, several lights were on, the front door was unlocked and with a cold sense of foreboding he checked on Lisa to discover she was gone.

In the weeks that followed young mother Deborah was forced to admit to having fallen asleep drunk.

Posters of Lisa were tacked to the front of the family’s clapboard home. Fading kidnap appeal posters are still strapped to neighbors’ trees with yellow ribbon. A banner on the Irwin’s home reads: ‘This house needs Lisa to make it home again. Help bring Lisa home.’

A little pebble, bearing the word ‘Hope’ sits at the door.

Speaking to MailOnline last year, Jeremy said: 'Is it heartbreaking and depressing every single time you see it? Absolutely. But it’s not going anywhere soon until she comes home.'

As a couple, Deborah and Jeremy try to maintain as much stability as possible for sons, Blake, 11, and Michael, 7. Blake is Jeremy’s son from a previous relationship and Michael is Deborah’s from her first marriage. Lisa is their only child together.

Over the weekend and on holidays Lisa’s older brothers help hand out fliers and buttons and bracelets. Sometimes, Deborah admitted, it is their strength that gives her the will to carry on.

She clutches Lisa’s favorite Barney toy in bed each night.

‘You have these moments when you just can’t believe that somebody stole your baby,' she told MailOnline in 2013.

Deborah’s one consolation is her belief that whoever took Lisa did not do so with the intention of harming her.

She added: ‘Nobody takes a baby to hurt them.'
