It is called labour for a reason, and if you are a woman who has endured the agony of childbirth you may want to look away now.

New research claims that the pain of having a football club relegated is the male equivalent to the pain of childbirth (according to a group of football fans).

Nearly two-thirds (63 per cent) of season ticket holders polled felt that the pain of relegation was the nearest most men would come to experiencing the pain of giving birth.

It's called labour for a reason: A new study reveals that the pain of having your football club relegated is the nearest male equivalent to the pain of childbirth... according to football fans

Even the less committed fans, who attended only one game per season, agreed that relegation was the male equivalent to childbirth.

Spare a thought then for the fans of Fulham - including Daniel Radcliffe, Hugh Grant and Piers Brosnan - and Cardiff, whose clubs are now officially relegated from the Premiership this season.

And for those of Norwich - including Delia Smith, Stephen Fry, and Hugh Jackman - who look likely to follow them.

The survey was conducted by the polling 
company TLF, on behalf of Warren United, a new animated sitcom on ITV4 
about a diehard fan of a rubbish football team.

When Bristol Rovers were relegated last week after 94 years as a Football League team, the club’s fans were heartbroken.

Fan
 Kelly Ballard, tweeted: 'Devastated about Bristol Rovers result. Not 
sure how my husband is going to cope though??? "It's only a game" won't 
cut it.'

Pete May, author of the book and blog, “Hammers in the Heart: A Lifetime of Supporting West Ham", and survivor of multiple West Ham relegations says that only a true fan understands the pain of relegation.

'I remember once when we were relegated seeing this huge skinhead in tears. He was holding his head in his hands and sobbing,' he said.

May, of course, has never given birth himself but he has attended the birth of both his daughters, now in their teens.

'I’ve seen childbirth twice and relegation five times', he says. 'Childbirth does look look very painful' he admits, 'but it only lasts a few hours. The pain of relegation lasts all summer. And beyond.'
