England batsman Michael Carberry has signed a new three-year deal with Hampshire.

The 33-year-old's existing deal expired at the end of the current campaign, but he is now committed until the end of 2017.

Carberry, who opened during the winter's dismal Ashes series and faces an uncertain international future after being ignored by head coach Peter Moores this summer, said: 'It's taken some time but I'm pleased it's now done and dusted and I can now just concentrate on doing well for the club for the next three years and hopefully we can be successful.

'If we can secure promotion this year in the County Championship that would be great, it would be nice to play Division One cricket again soon and hopefully I can continue to do well for the club by scoring some runs.

'Hopefully, we can win some more silverware before I finish all together and I'm looking forward to the next three years.'

Hampshire director of cricket Giles White added: 'As well as being an extremely popular figure at Hampshire, Michael is a proven match winner and senior player that leads by example. It is great to have him around and playing his part in what promises to be an exciting period for the club.'
