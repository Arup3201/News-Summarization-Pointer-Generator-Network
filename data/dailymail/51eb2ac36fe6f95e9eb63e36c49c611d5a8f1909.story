The manufacturer fought hard to ensure its original Jaffa Cake was a cake, not a biscuit - but they're unlikely to have any trouble with this product.

McVitie’s started selling world-famous Jaffa Cakes in 1927 - but now it's producing them as full-sized cakes for the first time.

The firm won a celebrated court battle in 1991 to have Jaffa Cakes officially recognised as chocolate-covered cakes.

The taxman had insisted Jaffa Cakes are biscuits, taxed if they are ‘half or more covered by chocolate’. But the manufacturer insisted they are cakes, which are not taxed.

Obscure legal arguments focused on discussions about how a cake is something which starts off soft and goes hard when it is stale, while a biscuit starts off hard and goes soft.

A giant Jaffa cake the size of an ‘ordinary’ cake was even produced as evidence in court. Eventually the judge ruled the Jaffa Cake is, indeed, a cake.

The £7 Big One, a cake-sized version of the Jaffa Cake, is now being sold in Asda and Morrisons.
