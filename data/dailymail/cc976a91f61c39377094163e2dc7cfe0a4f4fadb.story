Lucrative pay deal: Martin Bean is one of the highest-paid university chiefs despite falling numbers

The head of the Open University is seeking a £45,000-a-year aide to write his speeches despite his own £407,000 pay packet.

The bumper pay deal handed to Martin Bean fuelled growing anger last night over the size of salaries enjoyed by university chiefs and expanding higher education bureaucracies.

Since Mr Bean took over at the OU in 2009, student numbers have slumped by more than 50,000 and tuition fees more than tripled – a bigger relative increase than at any conventional university.

He took home £351,000 in 2012/13, swollen by his pension to £407,000, which made him one of the highest-paid university vice-chancellors in the country.

Now it has emerged Mr Bean, an Australian-born former Microsoft executive, has advertised for a ‘speechwriter’ on a salary of £37,756 to £45,053-a-year.

The chosen candidate, who will be the second holder of the post, will ‘be responsible for researching, writing and editing all of the vice-chancellor’s speeches, explaining often complex ideas in an engaging and inspirational way’.

Mr Bean is unusual among vice-chancellors in not having an academic background. Instead he worked for education and technology firms including Microsoft, where he was responsible for developing and marketing education products.

The pay of his predecessor, Professor Brenda Gourley, was £309,000 when she left in 2009, 24 per cent less than Mr Bean’s.

Controversies during his tenure include the decision to more than treble tuition fees, from £1,540 for a full-time degree to £5,000 a year, and part-time courses from around £700 to £2,500.

Controversies during Mr Bean's tenure since 2009 include more than tripling the fees from £1,540 to £5,000 a year

It prompted claims the university, set
 up in 1969 to help those who may have missed out on educational 
opportunities earlier in their lives, had ‘sold out’ its founding 
principles.

Mr Bean’s £407,000 package is 11 per cent higher than in 2011/12.

The university said this was because he took a pay cut of 10 per cent in 2010 ‘amid great uncertainty over future funding’.

In 2012/13, the year the fee increase kicked in, his salary was restored to the full rate.

The OU said this was because it was ‘well prepared for the new funding environment’.

In a speech last year, Mr Bean – or possibly his previous speechwriter – said a new OU-led ‘FutureLearn’ initiative to put vast numbers of courses online would allow students to escape the authority of ‘The Man’, or in other words, a university that tells students ‘you’re a failure because you didn’t do what we said’.

He added: ‘We’re going to let people set their own targets.’

Ministers have repeatedly called for universities to show ‘restraint’ when awarding pay to senior figures.

Yet vice-chancellors in the 24-strong Russell Group of leading universities took home average pay rises of £22,000 in the last academic year, taking their earnings, including salary and pension, to £318,500.

Professor David Eastwood, vice-chancellor of Birmingham University, is thought to have one of the highest basic salaries, at £400,000.

Sally Hunt, of the University College Union, which represents lecturers and other academic staff, said: ‘In a year when fees have tripled and pay for other university staff continues to fall, these salary hikes will be particularly galling.’

In 2010, Business Secretary Vince Cable warned vice-chancellors’ pay bore ‘no relation to the underlying economics of the country’.

An OU spokesman said: ‘The salary offered Martin Bean reflects the scale and complexity of the job.

‘Under Martin’s leadership, the OU has maintained its place as one of the highest ranked institutions for student satisfaction in the UK, kept its fees among the lowest in the county and brought together leading UK universities to form FutureLearn.’

He said Mr Bean had spoken at more than 50 events around the world in the past 12 months, and received 200 speaking requests a year.
