The French have amassed a proud history of protesting about more or less everything, but this must be a first.

Thousands of residents of a small town are up in arms - because they want a new McDonald's.

Citizens of the nation famous for fine wine and gourmet cuisine took to the streets after red tape stalled work on the fast food restaurant, which they said would create much-needed jobs.

Big flak: More than 100 residents of Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise, near Lille, took to the streets yesterday to demand work resumed on a new McDonald's. Amid high unemployment they say it will provide much-needed jobs

McDo no more: The restaurant was almost complete when it was halted by planning regulations. McDonald's is an unlikely hit in France, with 1,300 restaurants. The French eat almost a billion burgers each year

Some 4,000 people joined a Facebook group to protest against the decision in Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise, near Lille, by local bureaucrats last week.

A court in Lille had suspended construction work when the restaurant was almost finished, saying it did not comply with planning laws which reserved the land for industrial units.

But outraged residents protested, saying the order would stall the town's economic development and prevent around 30 new jobs from being created.

They called their Facebook group 'Oui oui au McDo' and 130 of them marched down the streets of the town yesterday with banners proclaiming: 'MANIF!!! (Demonstration) pour McDo'.

Those marching included union members, unemployed residents and several pupils from the town's schools.

Responding to claims that the town 
might simply have a hankering for hamburgers, one resident wrote: 'If 
it's the junk food that's bad we'll have to shut the kebab and chip 
shops in Saint-Pol.'

Another said: 'Seriously, I have a better lunch at McDonalds'.

Radical: Farmer José Bové was jailed for taking direct action against a McDonald's outlet in 1999

The plea for jobs came amid a 
political crisis in France, with a quarter of those who voted in 
European elections last week choosing Marine Le Pen's far-right Front 
National.

Observers say the surge in nationalism has been prompted partly by the country's economic woes.

Despite slight improvements in economies across Europe, the unemployment rate in France still stands at more than 10 per cent.

National pride, however, has not stopped France embracing a fast food franchise which was born in America and once faced huge opposition.

In 1999, farmer and anti-globalisation activist José Bové was jailed for three months after he ransacked a McDonald's in the southern French town of Millau.

Riding to the prison in a convoy of tractors, the walrus moustache wearing cult figure declared: 'I am a victim of politically-motivated justice.

'I will continue the fight while I am behind bars.'

Fast forward 15 years and the country has a staggering 1,300 McDonald's outlets, making it the second-largest Big Mac consumer in the world after the U.S.

It is also the biggest consumer of burgers in continental Europe.

Almost a billion burgers were sold in France last year - nearly half the sandwiches sold in the nation which created the baguette.

How times change: Just 15 years ago, José Bové won popular support as he rode to prison on a convoy of tractors and declared a message against globalisation to a crowd of 800 supporters in southern France

Winning them over: The chain used the French cartoon hero Astérix and introduced the McBaguette

However, McDonald's achieved its success not through Americanisation but by appealing to French culture.

It launched an advertising campaign 
featuring the national cartoon hero Astérix, while introducing the 
McBaguette and an Alpine burger with three different types of cheese.

And the French love of burgers still lags far behind that displayed by the English.

While
 the average Frenchman eats 14 burgers a year, the average Englishman 
eats 17, according to a 2012 global market research report.
