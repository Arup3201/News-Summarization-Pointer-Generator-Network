'Unethical': Judge Wade McCree reportedly got a witness pregnant after working on her case

A Detroit judge has been placed on leave after texting topless pictures of himself to a married bailiff been accused of getting a witness pregnant while presiding over her child support case.

Michigan Judge Wade McCree was placed on leave Friday, sources told The Detroit News.

McCree, who is married, allegedly had an affair with  Geniene La'Shay Mott after she brought her ex-boyfriend into his court for failing to pay child support.

The lovers even allegedly exchanged text messages discussing potential punishments for her former boyfriend, Robert King, who served jail time following the case.

The accusations come just three months after McCree was forced to apologise - and barely held onto his job - after sending nude photographs of himself to a female colleague.

Coming forward with these latest claims, his alleged mistress told MyFoxDetroit.com: 'I met him as a litigant, a complaining witness in his courtroom, and he stayed around after the case was over and that's when... our relationship picked up.

'It went from being a summer fling 
and just something to do... to falling in love, promises of marriage, me
getting pregnant, us buying a house together, name it.'

After McCree's wife found out about the baby, the couple separated but Mott said she will keep the child, despite McCree offering her 'anything she
wanted' to have an abortion, she said.

She added that she decided to speak out about the 
affair after he went to the Wayne County prosecutor claiming she 
was stalking him. Investigators found his complaints baseless, Fox 
reported.

Affair: McCree allegedly promised Geniene La'Shay Mott, both pictured, he would get divorced and marry her

Together: But he allegedly had a change of heart after his wife found out about her pregnancy

But there had been a time when she had wanted him around, Mott said, and described their sexual encounters in his 
chambers, and how she had even gone with him to deliver his divorce papers.

And alleged text messages between Mott and McCree shown to Fox  allegedly reveal the couple talking about King's punishment in the child support case, discussing his options.

'OK, The math will be based on his 
failures since being placed on probation, but if U'r right. The threat 
of jail will loosen his purse strings!' an alleged text from McCree said.

Another message apparently shows his fears that the relationship will be discovered.

'My judicial tenure commission has me nervous, as you might 
expect,' it read. 'I have to be real careful until this matter is put to rest.

'You 
are the complaining witness on a case that is before me. Naturally if it
got out that we were seeing each other before your BD's [baby daddy]'s 
case closed everybody could be in deep s***.

Speaking out: Mott said she decided to speak to Fox News about the affair after McCree went to a prosecutor to claim she was stalking him - claims which investigators found were baseless

'Why you want to spend time 
with a man like me remains a mystery but if you'll have me... then as Bill Withers said, 'use me up!' SMOOCHES.'

And further messages show he had a change of heart about the relationship and buying a home together after McCree's wife, Laverne, found out about 
the pregnancy.

Under fire: He previously had to apologise for sending topless pictures to a colleague

'I WANT 
(AND SO DOES LAVERNE) THIS TERMINATION,' one text read. 'U'LL GET 
WHATEVER U WANT 4 IT! I'VE BEEN CLEAR ON IT FROM THE GET GO! WHATEVER U 
WANT YOU SHALL HAVE!'

McCree refused to comment on the allegations.

Mott said she realised people who heard about her situation would tell her 'she knew what she was getting into messing with a married man'.

But
'I believed him with everything,' she said. 'His actions showed me that
he was leaving. He filed for divorce. I mean, there was nothing to say 
that we weren't moving forward.'

No criminal action will be taken against
Mott, the Wayne County prosecutor's office told Fox, and the matter 
is being referred to the Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission.

It
comes as yet more trouble for McCree, who barely held on to his job 
after it emerged he had sent topless pictures of himself to a court 
employee.

McCree admitted in April that he had sent the picture to bailiff LaDawnn Malone in 2006 and initially boasted about physique, memorably saying: 'I've got no shame in my game.'

'I've sent that out to other women,' he said. 
'There's nothing nude about it. I'm in no more clothes than I'll be at 
the Y this afternoon when I swim my mile.'

But
the judge soon backtracked and issued a public apology, saying: 'I am 
embarrassed and truly sorry for my actions, which have hurt and caused 
great pain to my family.'

A
ruling issued by the Michigan Supreme Court allowed McCree to
keep his job, but ordered that he be publicly censured for his antics.

Outrage: She had been in court over child support from her ex partner, Robert King (pictured), and allegedly discussed his potential punishments over texts with the judge while the case continued

The
court declared that the judge 'conducted himself in a flippant manner 
and did not give the interview the seriousness he should have. He brought shame and obloquy to the judiciary.'

The bailiff's husband added: 'It's totally inappropriate. It says a lot 
that he's flawed.

'He's
been looked upon as some great figure but, as you can see according to 
the picture, you see what he's really all about.

'What kind of man would 
send this to a married woman, knowing he's a married man himself?'
