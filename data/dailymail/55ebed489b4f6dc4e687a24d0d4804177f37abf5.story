Cruelty: Horse Breeder Evan Lloyd Evans has been jailed for ten weeks for keeping Welsh mountain ponies in such a state that the RSPCA put nine of them down and impounded another 51

More than 100 horses have been destroyed after they were kept in appalling conditions at a farm, it emerged yesterday.

The animals were among 400 found in a neglected state by RSPCA inspectors who swooped on the ‘deeply upsetting’ site.

In one of the ‘most significant animal welfare events’ ever seen, a charity spokesman revealed that over 100 of the animals were put down while around 300 have been moved to sanctuaries across the country.

The ‘owner’ of the horses, is the subject of an on-going investigation and cannot be identified.

Meanwhile, in a separate case a few hundred miles away from the site in South Wales where the 400 horses were found, another horse owner was jailed after many of his animals were also destroyed.

Evan Lloyd Evans, once considered a leading breeder, has been jailed for ten weeks for keeping Welsh mountain ponies in such a state that the RSPCA put nine of them down and impounded another 51.

The 69-year-old, who is said to have cost the animal charity £30,000, was also banned from keeping horses for ten years after being found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering and failing to meet the needs of his animals.

A court heard the hooves of nine horses were in such an untreatable state it was decided by a vet to put them to sleep rather than put the animals through further suffering.

Harrowing videos of the ponies’ living conditions and the condition of their feet were shown to Caernarfon magistrates’ court in north Wales.

The ponies were semi-feral, the court had been told, living in a hazardous environment.

The RSPCA are expected to take separate legal action after the discovery of the 400 horses on a farm in the Vale of Glamorgan, in south Wales.

The two cases show the shocking plight of horses in the UK - many of which were abandoned after the crackdown on the horsemeat trade branded them financially worthless.

Charities and animal sanctuaries are struggling with an influx of horses in appalling condition after unscrupulous dealers, hit by a slump in demand following the horsemeat scandal, abandoned them.

Around 7,000 horses are now considered ‘at risk’, according to the report by leading charities including the RSPCA and Blue Cross, with the horsemeat scandal a significant factor, but with over-breeding and the recession also playing a part.

Rescue centres have seen a rise of up to 40 per cent in admissions since it was revealed in January that some supermarket food labelled as beef contained horse.

Vet Nic de Brauwere, from Redwings Horse Sanctuary, in Norwich, which helped co-ordinate the rescue operation in South Wales, said: ‘The individual suffering is something we have seen before and will possibly have to see again.

‘But it was the totality of the situation that made it the most significant horse welfare event that I have ever been involved in.

‘What we found was a property with a large number of horses and other animals.

‘There were concerns for the welfare of all the horses and with the environment and conditions they were trying to cope with.

‘There were problems at every level.’

Council officials, RSPCA officers, police and vets spent six days earlier this month assessing the horses and providing treatment.

More than 300 horses were removed in lorries from the site, while other animals, including sheep, geese and dogs, were also removed.

An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘As more animals were assessed, the number of horses found to be in such a suffering state that they had to be put to sleep on veterinary advice rose to just over 100.

‘This was a tragic situation and one that was hugely upsetting for all those involved.’

She added that the charity was involved in an on-going animal welfare investigation and could not identify the horse breeder allegedly involved.

Steve Carter, the charity’s national director of Wales, said the ‘absolutely tragic incident’ was the result of overbreeding across the country and a lack of food.

He said: ‘There are just more horses than there are homes.’

Thousands of horses which would have been sold for meat are now simply being abandoned following the horsemeat scandal.

Where unwanted horses might once have gone to the meat trade, now their owners abandon them rather than pay up to £100 a week to care for and feed them.

Some are ‘flygrazed’ - a practice where owners, often from the travelling community, leave horses to graze on other people’s land without permission - on a patch of scrub.

The Animal Sanctuary, in Dorney, Buckinghamshire, is caring for a third more horses than this time last year and is spending more than ever on vets’ bills as many arrive in a horrific condition.

Head trustee Diana Coad said: ‘Before the horsemeat scare there was, sadly, a trade in horses for meat but now there’s no market for them.

‘People don’t want to pay to feed them or pay to have them put down, so unscrupulous owners are hiding them away in pockets of land and leaving them to starve very slowly and painfully to death.’
