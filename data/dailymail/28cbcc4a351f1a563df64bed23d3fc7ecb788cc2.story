David Cameron today spoke of his pride in supporting the Poppy Appeal as he welcomed the Poppy Girls to Downing Street.

The Prime Minister met the girlband with a difference - for all five
members are schoolgirls who have fathers who have risked their lives in the
Armed Forces.

The group was formed after an X
Factor-style talent competition for the children of military families run by
the Royal British Legion.

Appeal: David Cameron poses with The Poppy Girls outside Number 10 ahead of the Royal British Legion's 2013 Poppy Appeal

The singers - Megan Adams, 10, Florence Ransom, 10, Alice
Milburn, 13, Bethany Davey, 15, and Charlotte Mellor, 17 - helped Mr Cameron to fix a poppy on his jacket as they posed for the cameras.

They battled their way
past more than 1,000 other hopefuls to make it into the group.

The band met Mr Cameron in Downing Street this morning to launch the 2013 appeal.

Bethany told MailOnline said: 'I was too nervous to put 
the poppy on the Prime Minister, I didn't want to stab him with the pin,
so I made Charlotte do it.'

Charlotte added: 'It's such an honour 
being invited to meet the Prime Minister. We gave him the first hard 
copy of the single... After we'd checked that he had also downloaded 
it!'

Megan, from Stirling, Scotland, began singing lessons just a year ago. Her father, Lieutenant Commander William Adams, is on a six-month deployment in the Indian Ocean.

Megan said: 'David Cameron asked me about my daddy, because he's in the Indian Ocean doing anti-piracy work. I told him I miss him a lot.'

Florence, from 
Peterfield, Hampshire, whose father Lieutenant Ben Ransom, serves in the
Navy, added: 'He was very generous. He put £20 in the Poppy tin - it 
would take me a long time to save that much because my mummy only gives 
me 50p a week.'

Alice said: 'It was so much fun going to 
Downing Street, we got to go on a tour, meet the Prime Minister, see 
where all the MPs sit and even meet Larry the cat.'

Later Dean Davey, 
Bethany's father, said: 'I'm so proud of all the girls - they've done 
tremendously well. As a Reservist serving in the army, I can say that 
they have the support of the whole Armed Forces family.'

The Prime Minister 
wrote on Twitter: 'Proud to support the #PoppyAppeal with 
@ThePoppyGirls. The @PoppyLegion do a wonderful job.'

The Poppy Girls are hoping to wow an army of fans and crash into
the Top Ten with the official 2013 Poppy Appeal single.

Poppy Girls: Megan Adams, 10, Charlotte Mellor, 17, Alice Milburn, 13, Florence Ransom, 10, and Bethany Davey, 15, sing a 'hauntingly beautiful' track for this year's remembrance day. The song is by singer Regina Spektor

The song: The Call (No Need To Say Goodbye) will help raise £80million a year to support military personnel

The song, The Call (No Need To Say Goodbye), will help raise
£80million a year to support military personnel and their families.

Written by acclaimed American singer-songwriter Regina
Spektor, the lyrics are a poignant message of hope for those who will
not see their loved ones for weeks or months.

The Poppy Girls will perform the single in front of the
Queen at the Royal British Legion's Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert
Hall on Saturday, November 9. The song will then be released the following day.

The girls were selected after an exhaustive global search
for talent among Forces families, overseen by executives at Decca Records..

Children who had a parent or sibling serving in the UK or
overseas were allowed to enter the contest.

More than 1,000 children from places as far away as the
Falkland Islands and Kuwait, took part. Some had experienced the heartbreak of
having loved ones killed or injured on operations in Iraq or Afghanistan.

Praise: Dickon Stainer, president of Decca 
Records, praised the
girls' 'hard work, discipline and dedication'. (Clockwise from top left)

The competitors were whittled down to 60 for the 'live'
auditions and reduced again to 11 for the final. They went into the studio for
a gruelling selection process which led to the creation of the Poppy Girls.

Dickon Stainer, president of Decca Records, praised the
girls' 'hard work, discipline and dedication'.

He said: 'When you hear these young kids talk about their
families and the sacrifices they make growing up in a Forces family, you do
wonder how such young shoulders can carry the burden of the constant stress and
anxiety.'
