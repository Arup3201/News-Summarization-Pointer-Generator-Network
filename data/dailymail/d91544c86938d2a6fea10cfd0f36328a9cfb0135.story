New probe: Two police officers who had contact with paedophile Jimmy Savile are under investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission

Two detectives from Surrey Police who looked into sex abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile are under investigation, it was revealed today.

The serving detective constable and retired detective inspector interviewed women who claimed they were abused as school pupils by the shamed DJ.

Savile was alleged to have abused girls at Duncroft Approved School in Staines, Surrey in the 1970s.

Officials from the Independent Police Complaints Commission are leading inquiries into the conduct of the two officers.

They want to know if the pair properly passed on information about Savile to other forces.

The watchdog is already investigating how officers working for Sussex, North Yorkshire, Surrey and West Yorkshire forces dealt with claims about Savile's predatory sexual behaviour. 

An IPCC spokesman said : 'The IPCC's independent investigation is now into the conduct of two Surrey Police officers who were involved in the police investigation into allegations of sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile at Duncroft School in the 1970s.

'In addition to a retired detective inspector, a detective constable is now also subject to the investigation.

'The conduct investigation includes whether information was passed to other forces in a timely way.

'The inclusion of the second officer in the investigation follows a direction from the IPCC to the force to refer their conduct.'

Savile, who died aged 84 in October 2011, was questioned by Surrey Police in 2009 over the Duncroft School allegations, which he denied.

The Crown Prosecution Service ruled shortly afterwards that there was 'insufficient evidence' to bring charges.

Abuser: Savile attacked a number of girls at Duncroft Approved School in Staines, Surrey in the 1970s

A year ago, Surrey Police revealed it had interviewed more than 100 former pupils from the school, which closed in the 1980s.

A police spokesman said they were looking at the scale of Savile's abuse there and whether any staff knew about it.

A decision may be taken soon on whether to charge former staff.

Operation Yewtree was launched in 2012 after it emerged the late television presenter had abused hundreds of young people and children over more than five decades.

A total of 214 sex offences have been recorded against Savile across Britain.
