Engulfed by smoke, sparks and flames, these brave (or stupid) party-goers celebrate at a fireworks festival  - Mexican style.

In scenes to send shivers down the spines of health and safety executives everywhere, these amazing images were taken at the National Pyrotehcnic Festival in northern Mexican city of Tultepec, which produces the majority of the country's fireworks.

The images were taken by American photographer Thomas Prior, who was one of 100,000 people in attendance at the spectacular annual festival.

Seemingly oblivious to the danger, people are engulfed with sparks, flames and smoke at a fireworks festival in Tultepec, Mexico

A model bull goes up in flames at the National Pyrotechnic Festival in Mexico, an annual event which celebrates the fireworks industry - with seemingly little regard for health and safety

More than 100,000 attend the annual celebration, which is held in the town which is Mexico's biggest producer of fireworks

The festival began in the mid-19th century as a celebration in honor of John of God, the patron saint of fireworks makers

The main event is a parade of 'toritos' or bull-shaped frames with fireworks on them, with about 250 running along the streets

He said: 'It puts our Fourth of July celebrations to shame, really, although it’s probably best to avoid this sort of thing when we get together to watch stuff blow up two weeks from now. It looks as dangerous as it is awesome.'

The first of the main events involves 'castillos', which are frames made of wood, reed and paper to which various fireworks are affixed

Then follows the pamplonada, which is named after the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, Spain. Also frames, they are made from wood, reed, hard paper mache and wire and painted in bright colours.
