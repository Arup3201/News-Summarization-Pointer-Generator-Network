The soils and topography of Australia prevent almost all of its rain from running off into the ocean, causing Australia to act like an enormous sponge

A combination of weather patterns over the Indian and Pacific oceans funneled so much rain over Australia that the world's sea levels fell in 2011, scientists said.

Unlike other continents, the soils and 
topography of Australia prevent almost all of its rain from 
running off into the ocean, causing dry areas of Australia to act like an enormous sponge.

According to a U.S. study, the effect caused by the La Niña weather pattern around Australia meant global sea levels fell for 18 months during 2010 and 2011, bucking the long-term trend of rising sea levels
caused by higher temperatures and melting ice sheets.

The scientists said that as the atmospheric patterns have returned to normal, more rain is falling over the tropical oceans once more and the seas are rising again.

Dr John Fasullo, a scientist at the National 
Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in the U.S. said: 'It's a beautiful illustration of how complicated our climate system is.'

'The 
smallest continent in the world can affect sea level worldwide. Its 
influence is so strong that it can temporarily overcome the background 
trend of rising sea levels that we see with climate change.'

Dr Fasullo said most of the rain that normally falls over land usually travels back to the sea via streams and rivers over months so when there is torrential rain over the land, the effect on the world's sea levels is almost invisible.

However, during the La Niña of 2010-11, which saw the temperature of the eastern Pacific ocean drop and more rainfall over land then normal, global sea levels dropped by 0.3 inches for around 18 months.

The fall goes against the larger trend of sea levels rising by around 0.1 inch per year since 1993, which is believed to be caused by melting glaciers and ice sheets as well as water temperatures warming up, which are linked to global warming.

However, since 2011 and the end of La Niña, sea levels have risen faster than before at around 0.4 inches per year.

The research, published in Geophysical Research Letters, links the fall in sea levels to more water storage on land, which occurred at the same time as La Niña.

Dr Fasullo noted there have been other La Niña events when scientists did not observe a drop in sea levels as dramatic as in 2010-11.

By the time this second image was taken in March 26, 2011, a huge amount of rain had fallen across Australia instead of in the ocean. The scientists said that as the atmospheric patterns have returned to normal, more rain is falling over the tropical oceans once more and the seas are rising again

In a bid to explain the phenomenon, the scientists found La Niña coincided with two other weather patterns that effectively funneled the water over Australia's land mass, where it seldom rains.

The Indian Ocean Dipole weather pattern, which carried atmospheric moisture across the ocean from the west, met the easterly moving moisture from La Niña.

A third pattern called the Southern Annular Mode then caused the rain to fall on the huge continent.

Dr Fasullo told NBC News: 'You have this collision of transports in
the Pacific and then southward into Australia — so a big funnel of 
tropical moisture into Australia — and that led to one of the wettest 
years on record in Australia, if not the wettest.'

Almost 1ft of rain fell over Australia during the 18 month period in 2010-11, which was effectively trapped in the Outback (pictured) with nowhere to go. Dr Fasullo said only in Australia could the atmosphere carry such heavy tropical rains to such a large area, only to have those rains fail to make their way to the ocean

Almost one foot of rain fell over Australia during the period and the rain was effectively trapped in the Outback - the dry, interior of the continent - with nowhere to go.

Dr Fasullo said: 'No other continent has this combination of atmospheric set-up and topography. Only in Australia could the atmosphere 
carry such heavy tropical rains to such a large area, only to have those
rains fail to make their way to the ocean.'

Much of the water collected in the Lake Eyre basin, which has been likened to a massive inland sea in the east of the country, while most of the rest of the water was absorbed by the dry soil of the Western Plateau.

It is not known whether this strange occurrence will happen more regularly as earth warms up and scientists are not sure how global warming could effect the El Niño and La Niña cycle.

Dr Fasullo believes the event if partly due to climate change, but also partly natural as he claims it was a 'serendipitous interaction' of weather patterns that caused global sea levels to temporarily fall.
