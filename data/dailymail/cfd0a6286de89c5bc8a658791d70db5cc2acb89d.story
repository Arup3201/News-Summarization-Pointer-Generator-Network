The skeleton of a child lies inside a small coffin after it was washed out of the ground by heavy rain in Italy.

The mangled ossuary was one of an estimated 70 coffins that were swept away from a cemetery in Genoa this weekend leaving bones and skulls strewn along the banks of the Polcevera river.

And as the bad weather finally began to clear, workmen began the grim task of retrieving the bones and putting them back together so they can be re-interred where they were first laid to rest.

Washed up: The skeleton of a child can be seen inside a small coffin washed out of the ground by heavy rain in Italy

It comes as at least four people were killed in landslides triggered by torrential rain in Swiss-Italian border, a day after floods in southern France killed five people.

In the rain-drenched southern Ticino region of Switzerland, two people died and one was critically injured when a mudslide slammed into a small residential building.

On the other side of the border, a pensioner and his granddaughter were killed when another landslide engulfed a house on the Italian shores of Lake Maggiore. Three other family members survived.

Those landslides were the latest of many to recently have hit northern Italy and southern Switzerland amid incessant rainfall over recent weeks. The Italian Liguria region has been doused with as much rain in the first 15 days of November as it normally gets in an entire year.

Grim: About 70 burial niches and ossuaries ended up in the river after the wall of a cemetery collapsed following heavy rains

The tragedies also came a day after storms in southern France left five people dead, when their cars were swept away in flooding. In one heartbreaking case, rescue workers managed late Friday to drag a father from his car, lodged on a bridge submerged by torrential rains, only to see the vehicle with his wife and two young sons still inside torn away by the raging water.

In Switzerland, the bodies of two local women, aged 34 and 38, were pulled on Sunday from the rubble of the three-story apartment building in Davesco-Soragno, near Lugano, after being hit by the mudslide, police said. A 44-year-old Italian man, who was living with one of the women, had been dug out and taken to hospital in a critical condition, police told reporters.

Just across Lake Maggiore, a 70-year-old man died on Sunday after his house was partially buried in a 'sea of mud' unleashed after the rain-doused hill behind the building gave way.

Digging: But many of the coffins remain missing as the search effort continues

Collapse: This is the collapsed wall where the coffins had been interred. It comes as at least four people were killed in landslides triggered by torrential rain in Swiss-Italian border, a day after floods in southern France killed five people

Rescue workers managed to drag his 16-year-old granddaughter from the rubble after more than four hours of digging but she died later in hospital.

Her parents and grandmother survived. The family's small, two-storey villa was the only property affected in Cerro, a hamlet on the outskirts of Laveno Mombello, a popular holiday spot.

A neighbour described how he had been awoken during the night by a huge bang 'like fireworks', and seeing rescue workers and the girl's parents 'digging with spades, even with their bare hands'. 'It was a horrific scene,' the neighbour told Italian television.

The tragedy means a total of 11 people have died in Italy in accidents related to the freak weather conditions in just over a month. That toll was expected to rise to 12 later Sunday as rescue workers continued to search for a man whose car was swept off the road by a torrent of water near the Italian Riviera's main city, Genoa.

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, speaking from the G20 summit in Australia, said the havoc wreaked by the heavy rain was the result of years of neglect of infrastructure. 'We have had 20 years of land management that needs to be scrapped,' he said.
