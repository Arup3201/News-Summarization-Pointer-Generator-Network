L'Oreal cosmetics heiress Liliane Bettencourt, pictured earlier this year, has threatened to emigrate France, where she is the country's richest woman

France's richest woman threatened to emigrate today after a judge ruled that she was 'mentally unfit' to manage her £15 billion fortune.

Liliane Bettencourt, who inherited the L'Oreal cosmetics fortune, was told that she had dementia and Alzheimer's and is no longer well enough to run her business affairs.

In turn, the 88-year-old said she was fine, and accused her daughter of plotting against her to try and wrestle control of one of the most successful companies in the world.

Mrs Bettencourt, who turns 89 on Friday, is also suspicious of France's judicial authorities who are investigating her for allegedly giving brown envelopes full of cash to leading politicians in return for tax breaks.

These include President Nicolas Sarkozy, who was once a regular visitor to the Bettencourt household in Neuilly, the upmarket Paris suburb.

Sitting in a court in Courbevoie, in north west Paris, Judge Stephanie Kass-Danno granted the controversial ruling following a petition by Mrs Bettencourt's daughter, Francoise Bettencourt- Meyers, 58.

Mrs Bettencourt- Meyers had argued that her mother was being negatively influenced by members of her 'entourage' to whom she kept handing out money.

But, speaking just before the judge's decision, Mrs Bettencourt said: 'If my daughter wins I will go abroad.'

She said that having her money put under the control of a daughter to whom she seldom speaks would be a 'nightmare'.

Mrs Bettencourt also objected to another part of the ruling that states that she herself will be under the 'guardianship' of her grandson, Jean-Victor Meyers.

The family feud stared in 2007 when Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers accused a photographer called Francois-Marie Banier of taking advantage of her mother's condition by persuading her to give him around £1 billion worth of artworks, insurance policies and cash.

It then turned into a political scandal after it was alleged that Mrs Bettencourt had effectively 'bought' tax breaks from politicians like Mr Sarkozy.

A judicial enquiry has been opened into the so-called Bettencourt Affair, but it is unlikely to conclude before next year's presidential elections.

Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Jean-Rene Farthouat, said today's ruling was 'contrary to good sense' and there would be an appeal.

Mrs Bettencourt is the daughter of the founder of L'Oreal, Eugene Schueller, and sits on its board.

The family owns a 31 per cent stake in the company, worth about £14 billion.

After the ruling, Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers reassured investors that the decision to put her mother under guardianship would not affect the company in any way.
