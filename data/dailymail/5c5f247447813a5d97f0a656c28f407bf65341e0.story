These are the men accused of murdering a retired British businessman during a bungled robbery in St Lucia.

Roger Pratt, 62, was killed and his wife injured when a masked gang ambushed their yacht under darkness last Friday.

Mr Pratt was punched eight times in the face when he fell - or was thrown – into the water unconscious and drowned.

These are the men accused of murdering Roger Pratt during a bungled robbery in St Lucia

The men are accused of stealing a fishing boat and rowing out to the Warwickshire couple's £200,000 yacht, where they demanded valuables and cash

Yesterday afternoon, four men were brought to the courthouse in Vieux Fort in handcuffs.

The suspects, dressed in shorts and t-shirts and in their twenties, tried to cover their faces as they were led out of a police van.

Detectives said the men were known to police for 'petty crimes', including theft.

The men are accused of stealing a fishing boat and rowing out to the Warwickshire couple’s £200,000 yacht, where they demanded valuables and cash.

They brutally beat the holidaymakers, but swam away from the scene empty-handed, after seemingly panicking when the robbery turned violent, police said.

Yesterday, the men sat with their heads bowed as the charges of ‘murder and robbery’ were read out in court.

Magistrate Robert Innocent remanded them in custody until next month, when a preliminary hearing will take place.

As they were led from the court, the sister of the one of the suspects screamed at police officers.

‘They are not animals, you cannot treat them like dogs’, urging her brother to ‘put your shirt over your face’ to hide his identity from the television cameras.

One of the men, in a checked shirt, took off his ring and handed it to a relative before being forced into a police van.

The men were named in court as Kervin Devaux, Franis Joseph, Richie Khern, and Jeromine Jones.

The men all live in a ‘swampy’ shanty town called Bruceville, half a mile from the bay where Mr and Mrs Pratt anchored their yacht in Vieux Fort, police said.

Detectives arrested five men after receiving ‘intelligence from the local community’, but only four have been charged.

Mr and Mrs Pratt were halfway through a dream year-long sailing trip around the world when the attack occurred.

Mrs Pratt, 60, who suffered two black eyes and bruising to her cheekbones during the assault, did not attend yesterday’s hearing.

The retired management became separated from her husband during the assault and found him floating in the water.

She made a desperate mayday distress call to neighbouring yachts, who responded, but they were unable to resuscitate Mr Pratt, police said.

Detectives believe the suspects did not intend to kill the couple but that the situation 'escalated' and got out of control.

Grieving widow Mrs Pratt is currently staying in a hotel near the capital city of Castries.

She has returned to the yacht several times since her husband was murdered.

Family said she intended to fly back to Britain, while friends sail the yacht back to the UK.
