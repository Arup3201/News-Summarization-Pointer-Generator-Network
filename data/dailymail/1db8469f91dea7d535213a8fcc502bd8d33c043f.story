Still savouring those victorious scenes from Gleneagles? On the European Tour, they’ve moved on already. In Portugal on Tuesday evening at a meeting of the Tournament Players’ Committee, the process will begin to choose Paul McGinley’s successor as Ryder Cup captain.

Up for discussion are not only the candidates and the timeframe for the announcement, but the potentially crucial appointment of who will be the committee’s representative.

That person will then join the last three captains (Colin Montgomerie, Jose-Maria Olazabal and McGinley) plus the tour’s chief executive George O’Grady in making the choice. The popular view is chairman Thomas Bjorn will represent the committee but that might prove wide of the mark owing to an obvious conflict of interest.

If the Dane doesn’t throw his hat into the ring this time, he would rightly be a strong candidate to be captain in Paris in 2018. In which case, should he be voting on the captain for 2016 when he would be virtually guaranteed that vote regarding his own candidature in France?

If Bjorn doesn’t stand to be captain this time, we’re seemingly down to a fight between Darren Clarke and Miguel Angel Jimenez, and what a fascinating contest that promises to be.

Here you have two leading representatives from two different schools of thought. On the one hand you have a man who has won the highest honour the game can bestow and been a rock in previous Ryder Cups; on the other you’ve got Jimenez, a McGinley-type figure who might not have won majors but understands the Ryder Cup and knows what it’s like to captain a team of his peers.

Of the five who will make the decision, it’s reasonable to assume Monty will go for Clarke and Olazabal for his fellow Spaniard. O’Grady will hope to be spared the casting vote.

As for McGinley, he is too decent a man to let his well-documented fallout with Clarke have an overriding bearing on his decision. Rather, he will put in his usual due diligence, ask the leading players what they think and take it from there.

Which leaves the players’ representative, and clearly a key man in deciding a contest that presently looks too close to call.

Expect the captain to be announced early in the New Year at a glitzy press conference in London or at Wentworth.

So much for the thought American interest in the Ryder Cup might wane because they keep losing. For evidence, just witness the extraordinary bloodletting that has been going on over the past week, culminating in captain Tom Watson’s remarkable mea culpa statement over the weekend.

They care, all right.

My favourite moment was PGA of America president Ted Bishop highlighting the fact that 2012 captain Davis Love was the only American incumbent this century who had been blooded in the manner of each European skipper, in first serving an apprenticeship as vice-captain. 

This from the man who appointed Watson, who hadn’t been near a Ryder Cup in over 20 years!

Forgotten amidst all the hankering for the return of Paul Azinger and his ‘pod’ system that proved successful in 2008 was the fact that Love was actually a really good captain at Medinah. He just got unlucky when Justin Rose holed a couple of putts from downtown on that miraculous Sunday.

As for the next American captain, there’s a perfect candidate staring them in the face and it isn’t Azinger, who’ll just give the thing a nasty edge. Steve Stricker is their Paul McGinley.

‘I regret that my words may have made the players feel that I didn’t appreciate their commitment and dedication to winning the Ryder Cup. I was their captain and, in hindsight, whatever mistakes that were made were mine.’

US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson walks the higher ground following locker-room revelations from Gleneagles. What could possibly have made the players feel unappreciated? Perchance Tom’s less-than-inspiring rallying cry, on the eve of Sunday’s singles: ‘This team sucks’?

What is it about men from Nottingham and finding their way back at the Dunhill Links at St Andrews? Eleven years after Lee Westwood won there to kickstart his journey from the wilderness all the way to world No 1, we now have the heartwarming story of Oli Wilson and his incredible victory on Sunday.

How wonderfully typical of this sport that the all-conquering world No 1 should get to the 17th, the most famous hole in the game, and putt from off the green into the Road Hole bunker, while the world No 792, who had never won anywhere, should play a clutch 80-yard shot to 3ft. Given all he’s achieved this year, it probably took Rory McIlroy five minutes to get over his disappointment; for Wilson, it was the moment he had waited for all his life.
