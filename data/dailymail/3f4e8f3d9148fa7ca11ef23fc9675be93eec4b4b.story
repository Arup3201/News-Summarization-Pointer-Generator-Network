Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust blamed an administrative error and said only five women will be contacted - because records indicate they would want to be informed.

The other 81 women willÂ  not be contacted in order to avoid 'widespread distress'.

The storage of fetal remains were revealed under a
Freedom of Information request by Channel 4 Dispatches.

The show, presented by Amanda Holden, investigates the treatment of couples
whose pregnancies end in failure.

Around 700 foetal remains are kept at Walsall Manor Hospital every year until the appropriate paperwork has been completed.

They are usually stored in the hospital's mortuary for between one and three months and then in the vast majority of occasions they are sent to be cremated.

But an error in getting documents signed off led to the remains in the 86 cases being kept for up to four years.

Two of the 86 cases date back to 2010, with another two in 2011, a total of 30 in 2012 and then 52 up to December 2013.

In 73 cases they belonged to foetuses under 12-weeks-old with with the remaining 13 being under 21 weeks.

Richard Kirby, chief executive of Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust which runs the hospital, has apologised.

He said: 'It is clear that in some 
cases the trust has kept remains following terminations and miscarriages
 for longer than we should have done.

'I
 would like to apologise to each and every patient who has been affected
 by this and would like to re-assure anyone who might be using our 
services now or in the future of our dedication in ensuring that this 
situation does not arise again.

'We are confident we have contacted everyone we need to in relation to this issue.

'There are five of the 86 who we think we should contact.

'For the others, the feel of all the advice we have taken and all the work we have done, we risk causing more distress by making contact.

'We will now be proceeding to arrange the cremations in line with our standard policy.'

Mr Kirby also said that without the relevant certification, the hospital was unable to release the remains for cremation.

Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust which runs the hospital, has now issued an apology and an investigation is underway

But he vowed to look into the full reasons behind what went wrong in the 86 cases which have been discovered.

He added: 'We have asked for an independent review. We want a really thorough understanding of what went wrong.'

The results of the independent review are expected at the end of April this year and the hospital has received advice from the Miscarriage Association and bereavement teams on how to contact and support patients.

It has said it will 'appropriately dispose' of the 86 foetal remains through the crematorium in line with 'usual processes'.

Yesterday Labour MP for Walsall North, David Winnick demanded a full inquiry into the matter.

He said: 'I find this very puzzling and distressing.

'There needs to be a full explanation and if necessarily a full inquiry.

'It will come as a shock to the people in the borough and understandably so.'
