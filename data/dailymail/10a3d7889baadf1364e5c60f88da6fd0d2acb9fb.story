Adam Johnson has returned to training with Sunderland after they lifted his suspension following the extension of his police bail.

Sunderland suspended Johnson, 27, pending the outcome of a police investigation after he was arrested on March 2 on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. On Tuesday Johnson's bail was extended by five weeks until April 23 and on Wednesday it was revealed his suspension was lifted.

Johnson could now feature for new boss Dick Advocaat in Sunderland's fight for survival.

Sunderland said in a statement: 'The club has discussed the current position in detail with both the PFA (Professional Footballers Association) and Adam’s representatives.

'In line with those discussions we recognise that the player is entitled to re-commence his duties with the club while the legal process continues. He will therefore return to training.

'The club’s own investigation cannot continue until the conclusion of the legal process.

'Sunderland AFC will make no further comment on the matter due to the ongoing police investigation.'
