Tragic: Catherine Moston was 37 weeks' pregnant when she took ill at the school where she worked in Rochdale, Manchester

A heavily pregnant teacher collapsed in class and died in hospital with her unborn baby.

Catherine Moston, 35, was three weeks from giving birth when she started feeling weak at work and went home to rest.

Her condition continued to deteriorate and she stopped breathing in the ambulance sent to help her.

Paramedics resuscitated her but her unborn daughter, Esther Grace, was pronounced dead at the hospital.

Doctors then battled to save Mrs Moston’s life but within hours she died after suffering a ruptured placenta and  cardiac arrest.

Last night her distraught  husband, Matt, 38, said he and daughter Isla, three, were struggling to get to grips with the tragedy. ‘This happened completely out of the blue,’ he added.

‘We were due to go into hospital to have the baby turned because it was breached but that’s just normal.

‘Everyone just presumed the pain was the baby turning itself or it had already turned and it was early labour.

'The doctors said it’s a very, very rare thing to happen, which is why no one was expecting it.

‘Catherine was looking like a ray of health at the weekend and she was just so excited about the baby.

‘She was a devoted mother and loving wife. She was my rock really. Isla is OK but it’s so hard to tell a child. We’ve told her mummy is with the angels.’

Mrs Moston, who was head of  science at Middleton Technology College, near Rochdale, was 37 weeks pregnant.

She fell fatally ill on Wednesday – 24 hours before the appointment to try to turn her baby in the womb. Her father Peter Lee, 70, who summoned the ambulance on the advice of the midwife, said: ‘She was passionate about teaching, that’s what she wanted to do and she never looked back. She loved her job. She put so much into it.

Family: Mrs Moston, pictured with her husband Matt and daughter Isla, 3, is believed to have suffered a ruptured placenta. She had previously been warned that her unborn baby, Esther Grace, was in the breech position

Ambitious: She was head of science at the 1,030-pupil Middleton Technology School (pictured), where she had worked for 10 years. She is also believed to have been in line to become deputy head teacher

Devoted mother: Her widower Matt said she was an 'amazing mum and wife' who 'organised our whole lives'

Successful: Mrs Moston was said to have 'put pupils first and herself second'

‘Her lessons were always rated 
outstanding in Ofsted inspections. She was very bubbly, loving and 
popular. She was always well liked, she was just that sort of person and
 it came out in her teaching.’

Mrs Moston, who had a sister and two brothers, met her husband at a wedding in October 2003 and they married in 2008.

She
 became head of science at 1,030-pupil Middleton Technology College and 
was seconded to other schools to improve their teaching.

In
 a letter to parents, headmistress Allison Crompton wrote: ‘Cath was a 
brilliant teacher and colleague who was extremely well regarded 
professionally and well liked by everyone, and will be greatly and sadly
 missed.’

Tests are being 
carried out to establish the cause of death but it is believed Mrs 
Moston suffered cardiac arrest due to internal bleeding.

A
 ruptured placenta during the  latter stages of pregnancy is a  serious 
condition and is the most common cause of late pregnancy bleeding.

Even
 after a diagnosis has been confirmed, it can be difficult to determine 
just how much of the placenta has separated from the uterine wall.

The
 more the placenta has separated, the greater the risk to the mother and
 her baby. If an abruption is severe, often the only option is to induce
 labour.

Former pupils left 
messages on Twitter expressing shock at the  tragedy and praising the 
teacher for her dedication and friendliness.

Marie Taylor said: ‘Truly one of the most loveliest women I know.’

Another
 pupil, Faye Kennedy, said: ‘She was such an amazing teacher and person 
and inspired so many young scientists like myself.’

Devastating loss: A post-mortem examination is expected to be carried out into the 35-year-old's death
