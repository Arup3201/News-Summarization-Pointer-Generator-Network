Following their easy 4-0 win against Lithuania in Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier England will face a much sterner test when they travel to Turin for an international friendly against Italy on Tuesday night.

Here, Sportsmail's Sam Cunningham reminds you of 10 classic matches between the two sides.

Italy 1-1 England, May 1933, friendly (Stadio Nazionale del PNF, Rome)

This was the first ever meeting between the two sides, most famous for Italy’s fascist leader Benito Mussolini cheering from the stands and being played in a stadium which translated into English as the ‘National Stadium of the National Fascist Party’. England’s squad had to travel by train, setting off from London Victoria, and boat to get to Rome for the match. Italy’s Giovanni Ferrari put the home side ahead in the fourth minute, but Arsenal striker Cliff Bastin scored his first England goal to cancel it out.

England 3-2 Italy, November 1934, friendly (Highbury, London)

This game was labelled ‘The Battle of Highbury’ afterwards. Italy defender Luis Monti broke his foot in only the second minute and it was full of ferocious challenges. Italy were perhaps spurred on by reports at the time that Mussolini had offered the players an Alpha Romeo and £150 each if they won. That incentive back-fired when England went three goals ahead in the first 12 minutes; Eric Brook scoring three minutes in, adding a second after 10 and Ted Drake getting a third. They almost managed to throw it away, allowing Guiseppe Meazza to score twice in the 58th and 62nd minute, but held on for the win.

Italy 0-4 England, May 1948, friendly (Stadio Comunale, Turin)

The Italians were still world champions, having won the World Cup in 1934 and 1938 and it being cancelled on the next two occasions due to World War Two. Italy’s manager was the great double World Cup winner Vittorio Pozzo, but they were rocked by Walter Winterbottom’s England. Stan Mortensen gave England a fourth-minute lead, Tommy Lawton added another and Tom Finney hit two second-half strikes within two minutes of each other. Goalkeeper Frank Swift, in his first match as captain, pulled off some stunning saves to keep Italy out with the score at 2-0. The result reverberated around the football world.

Italy 2-3 England, May 1961, friendly (Olympic Stadium, Rome)

Goals from Omar Sivori and Gerry Hitchens put the scores level at the break, but Sergio Brighenti struck another shortly after and with only 13 minutes to play England were still trailing 2-1. That was until Hitchens netted his second of the match and with only five minutes remaining former Tottenham striker Jimmy Greaves got the winner. The match was 54 years ago, but still the last time England beat Italy on their own soil.

England 3-2 Italy, May 1976, friendly (Yankee Stadium, New York)

England’s greatest comeback against the Italians came in the USA Bicentennial Cup Tournament. They were two goals behind by half-time, both strikes coming from forward Francesco Graziani. But in a devastating eight-minute spell after the restart England were in front. Former Southampton striker Mick Channon netted a minute from kick off, Liverpool defender Phil Thompson levelled the match two minutes later and in the 53rd minute Channon got the winner.

Italy 2-0 England, November 1976, World Cup qualifier (Olympic Stadium, Rome)

This was the game which effectively stopped England qualifying for the 1978 World Cup. By the end of the qualifiers, even a draw would have been enough to send them through, but Giancarlo Antognoni scored first and Roberto Bettega, set up by a stroke of genius from Franco Causio, sealed the win for the Azzurri. England won all of their remaining matches and both teams finished the group joint on points, Italy three ahead on goal difference. It ended the reign of England manager Don Revie.

England 2-0 Italy, November 1977, World Cup qualifier (Wembley Stadium, London)

The return was meaningless in terms of World Cup 1978 qualification, but Ron Greenwood had succeeded Revie as caretaker manager and England responded to their previous defeat with goals from Kevin Keegan and Trevor Brooking. It set up Greenwood to go on to the 1982 World Cup in Spain, where they came home undefeated despite being knocked out in the second group stage of the Finals.

Italy 1-0 England, June 1980, European Championship group stage (Stadio Comunale, Turin)

Italy were the home nation for the 1980 European Championship, and essentially sent England home in the second group match with this slim victory. England badly missed the injured Trevor Francis and lacked firepower up front. His absence proved costly when Marco Tardelli sent the crowd wild with a 79th-minute strike. England managed to beat Spain 2-1 in their final group match, but, at a time when there were only two groups, it was not enough to help them progress.

Italy 2-1 England, July 1990, World Cup third-place playoff (Stadio San Nicola, Bari)

England had been agonisingly knocked out of Italia ’90 in the semi-finals on penalties by Germany, while hosts Italy suffered the same fate against Argentina. It meant they met in the third-place playoff. Roberto Baggio put Italy ahead in the 71st minute and 10 minutes later David Platt levelled. But four minutes from time, Paul Parker conceded a penalty which Toto Schillaci slotted in to finish as tournament top-scorer with six.

Italy 0-0 England, October 1997, World Cup qualifier (Olympic Stadium, Rome)

This was a bruising, battling performance which left Paul Ince covered in blood and forehead bandaged, but England with the vital draw they needed to qualify for the 1998 World Cup in France. The stadium was thick with tension - as was a nation back home in England - and in the latter stages Ian Wright hit a post while Italy’s Christian Vieri headed narrowly wide. The result meant Italy would have to qualify for the tournament via a playoff against Russia, but England were through.

ANDREA PIRLO'S PANENKA

England 0-0 Italy (Italy win 4-2 on penalties), June 2012, European Cup quarter-final (Olympic Stadium, Kiev)

The first 120 minutes were not the most glamorous. Italy tortured England with possession and produced 31 shots on goal, but Roy Hodgson’s players produced a lesson in defending, John Terry particularly heroic, to take the game to penalties. What made this tie was Andrea Pirlo’s genius Panenka penalty. England were clinging on in the shoot-out until the Italy midfielder produced a moment of brilliance, sending Joe Hart plunging to his right as the ball floated down the middle with a whirlwind of backspin.

DAVID BECKHAM'S FIRST GAME AS CAPTAIN - AND SETH JOHNSON'S SOLO CAP

Italy 1-0 England, November 2000, friendly (Stadio delle Alpi, Turin)

The match was David Beckham’s first in charge as captain of the national team - a duty he would continue for many years - but it would end in defeat. Sven-Goran Eriksson was set to take over and was watching from the stands as caretaker boss Peter Taylor played an experimental side, in which Seth Johnson earned his one and only England cap. They lost by a single goal when Gennaro Gattuso hit an incredible strike in off the crossbar from 30 yards.
