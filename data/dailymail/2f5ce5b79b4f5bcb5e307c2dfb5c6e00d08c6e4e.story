Steffen Freund has been appointed international technical coordinator at Tottenham, the Barclays Premier League club have announced.

Former Tottenham and Germany midfielder Freund formed part of Tim Sherwood's back-room coaching staff, but has been handed a development role under new boss Mauricio Pochettino.

Pochettino brought his coaching team from Southampton to the north London club after making the switch from Saints in the close season.

The former Argentina defender now has Jesus Perez as assistant manager at Spurs, with first team coach Miguel D'Agostino and goalkeeping coach Toni Jimenez also moving to the capital from the south coast.

Freund will be responsible for developing Tottenham stars on foreign loan deals, supporting the club's international projects, academy partnerships and scouting potential new recruits.

Freund made 102 Spurs appearances between 1998 and 2003, and joined the club's coaching staff in July 2012 under then-boss Andre Villas-Boas.
