She's constantly trying out new looks and credited with sparking trends. But Rihanna's latest guise feels a little familiar.

The singer, 23, was pictured on the set of the music video for her upcoming single You Da One wearing a chin-length blonde wig.

But it was her bowler hat and the exaggerated bottom lashes beneath her right eye that appeared to have been inspired by cult classic A Clockwork Orange.

Rihanna found time in her relentless touring schedule to film the clip in London yesterday, ahead of her performance tonight at the O2 Arena.

The superstar singer, who is currently topping the UK charts with her single Talk That Talk, danced for the cameras in front of a pink wall and rickety red armchair, using a black cane as a prop.

Rihanna was dressed in a typically punk meets provocative outfit of denim cut-off shorts with a rip in the behind and backless white top with suspenders.

She also wore black printed leggings with 'boy' emblazoned on them and white leather boots.

The singer will play in Manchester on Friday night before leaving on a tour of Europe, returning for three extra London shows just before Christmas.

It was reported this week that Rihanna had sought advice from Beyonc√© after her intense touring schedule left her at breaking point.

The Sun claimed that the Barbadian star made a tearful phone call to the fellow performer to ask for some guidance in handling her workload.

But all of Rihanna's hard work was rewarded last night, when it emerged that she has received four Grammy Award nominations.

At the nominations announcement event last night, it was announced that she will be up for Best Rap Collaboration, Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album at the February ceremony.
