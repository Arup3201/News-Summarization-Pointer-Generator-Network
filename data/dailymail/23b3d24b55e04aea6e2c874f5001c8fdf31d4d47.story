A convicted thug who conned an 87-year-old widow out of £15,000 in savings for building work he never did is serving just eight days in jail.

Shaun Price and accomplice James Loveridge received credit for pleading guilty, despite being involved in a car chase to flee police and denying being the men who duped the pensioner when they were caught.

Price, 22, who already had convictions for theft, criminal damage and harassment, will be freed tomorrow.

Jailed: Shaun Price, left, and James Loveridge, right, will spend just eight days and two weeks in prison respectively after admitting involvement in a £14,600 scam. Their victim has been forced to leave her home

Loveridge, 18, who had a conviction for assault, will walk free next week after just a fortnight in jail.

Last night, Mrs Wilson’s son Richard said the sentence was no deterrent because their crime was so lucrative.

He added: ‘The fact they got more than £7,000 each for a few weeks in jail means it pays better than a job. I certainly don’t earn a wage that high, it pays better than any job I know.’

And campaigners said: ‘British justice has been put in the dock and found guilty of complete failure.’

Chester Crown Court heard that Price and Loveridge, who both live in caravan parks, targeted the grandmother last September, spending a week convincing her to pay for unnecessary roof repairs.

They persuaded the retired teacher to go to her bank and withdraw £4,800, then returned the following day to collect a further £9,800 from her.

But Mrs Wilson told her 49-year-old son about the visits and he immediately contacted police. He also called his mother’s bank to put a stop on the joint account he shared with her, so that when the conmen returned the following day for another £7,800, she was unable to withdraw it.

Victim: Elspeth Wilson, left, has moved to a retirement home after the incident, according to son Richard, right

He said: ‘Mum thought I had sent some workers to do some jobs for her, but I didn’t know anything about it.

‘When I checked how much was missing from her account I couldn’t believe my eyes. They took thousands and just kept coming back for more each time.’

Police placed a secret camera in bushes at the front of Mrs Wilson’s home, which recorded Loveridge walking up the drive on September 27.

Sentence: Judge Roger Dutton described the pair's crime as 'extremely offensive' and said they knew what they were doing was dishonest

Three days later officers were waiting in an unmarked car as he returned
 to the property in upmarket Stockton Heath, Cheshire. When confronted, 
he tried to escape in a van driven by Price, but they were caught after a
 high-speed chase.

Despite initial denials, they eventually admitted fraud by dishonestly making false representation for their own gain.

Loveridge,
 of Elton, Cheshire, and Price, of Widnes, were sentenced to four months
 in jail on January 23, but were only locked up for a few days each 
because their guilty pleas and the fact that both had to wear electronic
 tags while awaiting trial were taken into account.

The money they stole amounted to  half the insurance payout  Mrs Wilson received when her husband Peter died aged 84 last year.

Her
 son said: ‘When the police searched the homes of the two men, they 
couldn’t find any trace of the money. She won’t see a penny of that ever
 again.’

Mr Wilson added that although their punishment was 
short-lived, the ordeal would affect his independent mother for the rest
 of her life.

After she was duped, he was so fearful that she might 
be exploited again that he  moved her out of her home of almost 40 years
 and into a retirement complex where she felt more protected.

Yesterday, the electronics engineer criticised the courts for failing to punish or deter the cruel conmen.

He said: ‘I was shaking when I found out. Four months seems like a kick in the teeth. It doesn’t feel like a real punishment.

‘They did this to an old person who has worked for the benefit of society as a teacher the whole of her working life.’

Paul
 Green, a spokesman for Saga, the organisation for the over-50s, said: 
‘Eight days is an insult – eight years would have been much more 
appropriate.

‘The perpetrators clearly have no shame, but British 
justice has been put in the dock as well and found guilty of complete 
failure.’

Mrs Wilson’s MP, David Mowat, said: ‘This appears derisory.
 Given that this man already had a criminal record, it is a completely 
inadequate sentence and a failure of the justice system.’

The Tory MP
 said he would be raising the case with Justice Secretary Chris 
Grayling, who has vowed to ‘teach criminals that they will be punished 
for their crime’.

Despite a Coalition pledge to end so-called soft 
sentences, new figures show barely a quarter of all criminals convicted 
of serious offences were jailed in 2012.

More than 700 arsonists, 70 
rapists, 1,100 people convicted of sex assaults, 2,745 fraudsters, 162 
who killed by reckless driving and 77 kidnappers were among those who 
walked from court that year.
