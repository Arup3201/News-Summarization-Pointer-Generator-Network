Francois Hollande is preparing to marry his mistress on his 60th birthday next month, according to sensational media reports in France.

The country’s bachelor president has been plagued by rumours about his personal life since splitting up with his live-in-girlfriend in January.

Valerie Trierweiler, 49, had to leave the Elysee when Mr Hollande’s secret affair with Julie Gayet, a 42-year-old actress, was made public.

Miss Gayet has kept a low profile ever since – refusing to even acknowledge she is seeing the head of state – but may now be preparing to tie the knot.

Midi Libre, the highly respected newspaper, is one of many which reports: ‘The President of the Republic could make official his relationship with Julie Gayet by marrying her on August 12, the date of his sixtieth birthday.’

A Socialist Party source meanwhile told the Parisien newspaper: ‘It’s been three months that we have been hearing that he intends to formalise his relationship with Julia Gayet on August 12, when they will marry.’ 

The rumours intensified on July 14, Bastille Day, when Mr Hollande was asked directly about his private life in a live interview. Mr Hollande said: ‘When I have information, I’ll communicate it, I’ll do it, but I have none.’

According to the new claims, arrangements have now been made for a simple civic ceremony.

Mr Hollande, a Socialist, has never expressed any interest in the institution of marriage before, despite having four children with his Ecology Minister, Segolene Royal, another former girlfriend.

But it is thought that Mr Hollande has felt increasingly uncomfortable attending official engagements without an official partner.

If the marriage goes ahead, it will mean that France will have another ‘celebrity’ first lady, following four years of former supermodel and pop singer Carla Bruni, up until 2012.

While Julie Gayet, a divorced mother of two, is barely known internationally, she is a well-known TV actress in France, having regularly appeared in a number of programmes, films and talk shows.

Despite this, she launched civil proceedings against magazines for publishing pictures of Mr Hollande arriving at flat in Paris on the back of a moped.

She and the President were using the love nest, almost next door to the Elysee Palace, for secret trysts while Ms Trierweiler portrayed herself as first lady.

Ms Trierweiler suffered an emotional breakdown when she heard about the deception, checking herself into hospital for more than a week.

In recent weeks there have been rumours that Mr Hollande and Ms Trierweiler were intending to get back together again, but a marriage involving Miss Gayet would of course end all hope.
