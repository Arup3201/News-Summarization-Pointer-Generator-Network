Compared with the splendour of the pyramids or the majesty of the Taj Mahal, it may appear a fairly modest creation.

But a field of stone monuments in Wiltshire has been named as the second best heritage site in the world.

The collection of Neolithic stones in Avebury has been placed ahead of much more recognisable sites including the Valley of the Kings in Egypt and the Forbidden City in China.

Heritage: A visitor gets up close and touches one of the stones that form the largest stone circle in Europe at Avebury, Wiltshire. The site has been rated as the world's second best heritage site by travel experts

Special: Aerial view of Avebury village and neolithic henge stone circle

Ancient: The stones at Avebury are thought to date back to 2600BC

Experts at Which? Travel magazine placed Mexico’s ancient city of Monte Alban in first place.

The panel used criteria including the preservation of the site and appeal of the local region as a place to take a holiday.

The three stone circles at Avebury 
outscored more famous historic landmarks because of a high score on the 
overall visitor experience.

Chart-topper: Monte Alban, Oaxaca, in Mexico is the world's best heritage site according to travel experts from Which? magazine

Number seven: Avebury's neolithic monument was rated higher than the iconicTaj Mahal, in Agra city, India

Number ten: The ancient Pyramids, Giza, Cairo, Egypt

The site, which attracts more than 
250,000 visitors a year, was praised because tourists can wander freely 
between the stones, unlike the more famous Stonehenge, also in 
Wiltshire, where the formations are roped-off.

Avebury, near Calne, beat the pyramids
 of Egypt partly because rural Wiltshire was considered a nicer place to
 visit than the Sahara desert.

Visitors to the greener parts of the 
county enjoy beautiful rolling hills and quiet, picturesque villages.

Travel magazine described the Unesco World Heritage site as ‘the 
best-preserved and most impressive complex of prehistoric sites in 
Europe’.

Reacting to the news, Stuart Wheeler 
of Wiltshire Council said: ‘We have always known we have a wonderful 
piece of history on our doorstep and now we have official confirmation.’

Avebury is a Neolithic henge  monument
 comprising of three stone circles.

The monuments, thought to have been 
constructed around 2600BC, are the largest stone circles in Europe, and a
 place of great importance to pagans.

Dr Nick Snashall, National Trust 
archaeologist at Avebury, said: ‘Our dedicated team of staff and 
volunteers work year round to ensure that it remains a source of 
inspiration and delight.

‘It is wonderful to see that the very special qualities of Avebury have been recognised in this way.’
