A TV news anchor is set to make a miraculous return to work on Monday evening after enduring a horrific past five weeks during which his heart stopped beating on two separate occasions.

Leon Harris, a longtime anchor at WJLA-TV, an ABC News affiliate in Washington, D.C., has said he feels lucky to be alive after surviving a life-threatening health crisis which 
put him in intensive care unit for two weeks and has left him with half a pancreas.

His nightmare started on August 1, when he awoke suffering from an excruciating abdominal pain.

Leon Harris, 52, is set to make a miraculous return to WJLA-TV on Monday evening after almost dying twice in August after being diagnosed with acute necrotizing pancreatitis

The pain became so bad that the 52-year-old could barely move and his wife Dawn found him curled into a fetal position at their Potomac, Maryland. house.

Harris eventually had to be airlifted to hospital in Baltimore, where he was diagnosed him with acute necrotizing pancreatitis.

His condition was life-threatening as his pancreas was inflamed and starting to die, which in turn had caused his kidneys to start to fail and his lungs were filling with fluid.

The head of trauma at the Baltimore hospital described Harris' CT scan as ‘looking if a bomb had gone off… where the pancreas resides.’

To help him breathe Harris was placed on a ventilator and for the next nine days, he drifted in and out of consciousness.

A doctor told his wife and their two children - a daughter and a son - to prepare for the worst.

Speaking to Good Morning America about his ordeal, Harris admits he thought his time was up.

‘On two different days I died,’ he said. ‘I zeroed out and they revived me… I got sick and tired of trying to breathe.'

Harris, who described being on the ventilator as 'trying to snorkel across a lake breathing through a cocktail straw,' admits he was ready to die.

'And I closed my eyes and I happened to see Dawn's face … And I said, "I can't quit on her. If I quit on her, I'm going to go to hell, and if I go to hell, I'm not going to go to hell for quitting,'" he recalled.

Harris returned to work last Thursday for the first time since his sudden illness to see his colleagues and tonight he returns to anchor WJLA-TV's 5 o'clock and 11 o'clock newscasts

Then, just as suddenly as it came on, the pancreatitis subsided.

It's still a mystery as to how Harris developed the condition, Since he doesn't drink much alcohol and works out regularly, doctors think it could have been related to a family history of gallbladder problems.

Since getting out of hospital, Harris has been recovering at home and getting used to having just half a pancreas.
