A female after-school aid at a California Catholic school has been arrested and charged for an alleged two-year sexual relationship with a student, which started when the boy was 12.

Police say they began their investigation on Nov. 18 after being informed of a possible child sexual abuse case by a 'professional' mandated by the state.

Mia Cummings, 29, of Oakland, is facing eight felony charges of child molestation over an alleged two year sexual relationship with a male student, starting when the boy was 12

Hayward police officer Mark Quinn said in a probable cause statement that Cummings supervised the boy - now 14 - while he attended the after-school program and developed a relationship with him when he was 12-years-old.

The two would stay in contact by cellphone calls and text messages, according to ABC Local.

The boy has told police of at least 10 separate incidents in which Cummings would orally copulate him, Quinn said.

Five of the incidents occurred in the school's kitchen when the boy was 12, and five other incidents occurred off campus, including one in Cummings' apartment.

Prosecutors alleged that the incidents occurred between Dec. 1, 2011, and November this year.

On her Facebook page, Cummings lists her 'likes' as Skittles candy, Taylor Swift and the film The Goonies.

'(She said) ''I dont want to get him into trouble''.'
