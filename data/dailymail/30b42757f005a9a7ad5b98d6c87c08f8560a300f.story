This painstaking process takes days and involves decorating with millions of grains of sand.

But despite the arduous work, this sand mandala will be destroyed almost as soon as it is completed.

It has been created by Tibetan monks at Salisbury Cathedral's Chapter House.

The monks have spent days painstakingly decorating the sand mandala with millions of grains

The beautiful Chenrezig Sand Mandala has taken four days to complete at Salisbury Cathedral's Chapter House

After drawing a chalk outline of the design, monks use funnels to apply the coloured sand

The monks are touring places in the UK and Europe and will complete two other sand mandalas

They began making the mandala using coloured sand on Monday and will finish it today.

However, they will then hold a destruction ceremony and tip the sand into water.

Sand mandalas are an artistic tradition in Tibetan Buddhism.

They are of a symbolic picture of the universe representing an imaginary palace that is contemplated during meditation.

The monks will take part in a procession to the River Avon, where they will empty the sand so it spreads as far as possible.

The intricate design of the mandala is usually drawn in chalk before being filled with millions of grains of dyed sand.

Tibetan Buddhists believe the mandala gives positive energy and helps transform ordinary minds into enlightened ones.

Once completed the sand is swept into an urn before being scattered.

The monks, whose exiled monastery is in south India, are visiting various places in the UK and Europe and will complete two more sand mandalas.
