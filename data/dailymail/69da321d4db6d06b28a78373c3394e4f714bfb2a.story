It's the gadget that gives passengers who hate their legroom being invaded by reclining plane seats a chance to fight back.

The Knee Defender - billed with the tagline 'Standing up for the right of the tall guy to sit down' - is two pieces of plastic that are clipped on to the seat in front on a flight.

Fastening on to the arms of the tray table, the device, which costs £13, it locks the chair in front into place, preventing the passenger from reclining.

The Knee Defender is sold on Gadget Duck along with a note that the buyer can print out, fill in and hand to the passenger in front.

The 'Courtesy Card' tells the person in front that the gadget is being used, giving an choice of reasons including: 'Unfortunately, my legs are so long that if you recline your seat at all it would immediately bang into my knees.'

It continues to state that it 'may be an inconvenience' and encourages the passenger to complain to the airline 'to provide enough space between rows so that people can recline their seats without banging into other passengers'.

According to news.com.au, one user on Reddit who posted that he had been given the note on board a flight, wrote: 'Guy sitting behind me on  the plane handed me this as I was finding my seat before take off (my seat was up).

'I had no idea what to say.'

The gadget was invented by 6ft 2ins Ira Goldman, from the US.

According to the company’s site: 'Knee Defenders are specifically designed to be used with your tray table lowered, while your tray table must be up and locked during taxiing, takeoffs or landings.

'So, as long as Knee Defenders are being used as they are designed to be used in flight, their use does not violate any US aviation law, rule, or regulation.'

It adds: 'If the airlines will not protect people from being battered, crunched, and immobilized – very real problems according to healthcare professionals, medical studies, government agencies, and even some airlines – then people need options to protect themselves.'

Although the product does not violate any aviation laws, individual airlines can choose to ban its use on board their flights.
