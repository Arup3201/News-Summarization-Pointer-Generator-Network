Ten years ago Prince Harry went on gap year trip to the AIDS-ridden southern African kingdom of Lesotho and vowed to devote the rest of his life to help the troubled children he met there.

Today he played in a $1million polo match in the Middle East to raise funds for the continuing work of the charity he helped set up following that life-changing visit.

Speaking after the match to Mail Online the fourth-in-line to the throne candidly admitted that the last decade had been an 'emotional roller coaster' but said that he was hugely proud of what they had achieved.

Doing his bit: Prince Harry played in a $1m polo match in the Middle East to raise funds for his charity Sentebale today

Harry confessed that when Sentebale had started off he and his team were 'pretending we knew what we were doing' and mistakes had been made.

Indeed in 2008 the charity almost went bust, despite raising millions from the proceeds of a television documentary and a star-studded Princess Diana memorial concert.

There were repeated and damaging claims that too much money was being wasted in setting up the charity's African operation and too little being given to needy projects on the ground.

The prince told Mail Online: 'It started really really small....a very small group of us saying we’re not going to use the funds for other people, it’s going to be all for the kids and pretending we knew what we were doing.

'Ten years down the line we have made a couple of mistakes and in turn learned from our mistakes and now we know that actually, by speaking to the core problem, which in this case is the children themselves.... you get a really good taste of whether you’re achieving it or not.

'The great thing about Lesotho is that because it’s so small, you know that if you’re doing it wrong, it’s highly visible. And if you’re doing it right, you start to see the change.'

He admitted the charity was 'quite a hard sell for a lot of people'.

'It's a very small country that no one knows about, surrounded by South Africa, a landlocked country and I think that combined with us thinking that we knew what we were doing right, it evolved and it changed for the better,' he said.

'We realised our mistakes and we were willing to change it by speaking to the kids on the ground.

'What I’d like to think is that Sentebale has brought everyone together to work for one great cause.'

He added: 'It’s been an emotional rollercoaster but we’ve come out on top and all I’ve ever wanted to do was raise enough money to make a difference for Lesotho.'

Harry was speaking at the Ghantoot Racing and Polo Club where he was playing in the Sentebale Polo Cup, which his team won.

He plans to stay on in Abu Dhabi privately this weekend to watch the Formula 1 Grand Prix at the Yas Marina Circuit.

Among the celebrities attending the event were Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, seen in public for the first time since she announced her engagement to Formula 1 Red Bull boss Christian Horner, who is in the country for the Grand Prix.

She coyly declined to show off her engagement ring, saying it 'wasn't cool' but was happy to chat about Harry, whom she said she has known since the age of ten.

She said: 'I have met Prince Harry a few times. I've seen him since he was about ten. I have seen him grow up. It is brilliant what he is doing with his life . It's all for a good cause. I think he is a great ambassador for showing people that we care and he's got great spirit and heart. I think he's brilliant. We are looking forward to seeing him in action.'

Sentebale - which means forget me not and was chosen in memory of the prince's late mother - supports children in Lesotho, a tiny, poverty-stricken kingdom in southern Africa with one of the highest HIV/AIDS rates in the world.

Life expectancy for men and women in the kingdom is just 41 years, one in three children are orphans and there are believed to be more than 40,000 adolescents living with HIV.

Harry has spent the last thee days in Oman on a semi-official royal visit at the personal invitation of the country's Sultan.

Earlier yesterday he visited a mosque for the first time on the final day of a whirlwind tour of Oman.

The prince was given a tour of the breathtaking Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque in the capital Muscat, which can accommodate up to 20,000 worshippers at any one time.

Learning curve: Harry said he has learned a lot during his time at the helm of the charity

Dressed in a smart blue suit, Harry slipped off his shoes in accordance with religious custom as he was given a tour of the spectacular marble-floored complex.

The Mosque was a gift to the nation of Oman from its present ruler, His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said, to mark the 30th year of his reign.

Built from 300,000 tonnes of Indian sandstone, the main musalla – or prayer hall - has a central dome rising to a height of 164 feet (50 metres) above the floor.

The mosque also boasts the world's second largest hand-woven carpet, made from a single piece of cloth containing 1.7 billion knots and weighing 21 tonnes.

The building's majestic Swarovski crystal chandelier, which hangs above the praying hall, is equally impressive.

Weighing in at eight tonnes, it is a staggering 45 feet tall and has 1,122 lights inside that take two days to change, twice a year.

His visit, which was unannounced, caused waves of excitement among a group of schoolchildren who squealed with delight each time he walked past and jumped in front of the prince to pose for spur-of-the-moment selfies.
