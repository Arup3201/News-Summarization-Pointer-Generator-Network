It was love at first sight for a baby chipmunk who stumbled upon a teddy bear during a garden outing.

The young golden-mantled ground chipmunk planted a smacker on the pink stuffed toy after a few minutes of courtship in a garden in Colorado, U.S.

At first the chipmunk was suspicious of his new friend and approached the teddy bear with caution, but after a quick check, there was no denying the connection.

Come here you: A baby chipmunk found himself a new friend in a Colorado garden and was quick to give the pink bear a kiss and a cuddle

He gradually gained more confidence, 
plucking up the courage to examine the teddy more closely, and appeared 
to plant a kiss on the toy's mouth.

Then, in an almost human-like reaction, the chipmunk shut his eyes tight and clasped his hands together in a joy-like pose.

The heart-warming pose was captured by
photographer Betsy Seeton, 55, who had put the teddy outside her home for 
the squirrel to play with.

The chipmunk is a frequent visitor at Betsy's house and she has even nicknamed him Jasper.

She said that watching Jasper examine the teddy bear was like watching a toddler meet a new friend.

Suspicious minds: The baby golden-mantled ground chipmunk had an inquisitive look on his face as he tip-toed up to the stuffed toy before having a sniff to try and figure out who his new friend was

Did you come alone? After the initial hesitation the chipmunk, nicknamed Jasper, made sure the teddy did not belong to anyone else hiding in the bushes

Betsy said: ‘I put the teddy bear outside my home for fun and to see what Jasper would do.

‘Jasper stayed with the bear for at 
least a couple of minutes - and I definitely think it looked like Jasper
gave the teddy bear a kiss.

‘It is always fun to watch Jasper, and all the other squirrels and chipmunks that visit our home, playing and learning.

‘The curious behaviour is typical of these animals, they are always looking for nuts.

‘Of all the photos I have taken, these ones are definitely up there in terms of how cute they are cute.’

Sealed with a kiss: The young chipmunk does not hold back in showing the love for his new best bud
