Bring out your barbecue this Bank Holiday – but be ready to beat a retreat to the kitchen.

Because while forecasters say there is a good chance of sun, the bright patches are likely to be interrupted by sudden heavy showers.

It shouldn’t come as a surprise after last week’s short-lived heatwave was extinguished by storms on Thursday. Temperatures up to 26C (79F) were replaced by thunder, lightning and an inch of rain, causing road chaos.

Thunderstorms, hail and heavy rain 
cleared across Britain today with one town having an unexpected surprise
 when a lion-shaped cloud emerged from the sky.

This picture, taken by Heidi Webb, 39, comes ahead of Bank Holiday weekend which is set to bring a mix of sunshine and showers.

While Saturday could be a bit of a washout, with scattered showers across much of the country, the forecast looks much more promising for Monday when temperatures could reach 21C.

And if spring sunshine is what you’re after then the south coast is the place to head for, with the most prolonged periods of sunshine expected in Devon, Cornwall and East Anglia.

Scotland is also in for a pleasant long weekend, with sunshine spells and warmer than average temperatures.

Dan Williams, spokesman at the Met Office, said: ‘Saturday looks the most unsettled day of the Bank Holiday weekend and there are some heavy, scattered showers forecast.

‘On Sunday, it’s not going to be completely dry across the UK, but I think we’ll see some decent sun despite some cloud.

‘On Monday, we’ll see some good, dry weather around for most areas, with only light rain in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

‘It’s not going to be anything like the warm weather we’ve seen recently, but temperatures on Monday will still be above average which is pretty decent for this time of year.'

Drivers faced lengthy traffic jams and heavily congested 
roads today as millions of motorists attempted to start their Bank Holiday getaway journey early.

According to AA, as many as 17million cars could take to the roads over the weekend, with numbers swelled by a series of sporting events, music festivals and air shows.

By lunchtime today, the M25 in Dartford, Kent, was already at a standstill with lengthy tailbacks and speed limits had been reduced to 40 miles per hour to try and ease the congestion.

Traffic information company, Inrix, said journeys that would normally take 60 minutes on a Friday are likely to take 90 minutes today.

A survey by the RAC showed that Saturday is likely to be the busiest day of the holiday period, with around 3.5million motorists on the move.

National Express is laying on 10,000 extra seats on coaches over the weekend, with today expected to be the company's busiest day over the holiday.

London is its most popular destination, followed by Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Manchester and Bournemouth.

Meanwhile, hundreds of travellers are expected to fly abroad this weekend to take advantage of warmer European temperatures and the long weekend.

Gatwick is expecting 270,000 passengers to fly off from the West Sussex airport over the weekend, with the top five destinations being Barcelona and Malaga in Spain, Palma in Majorca, Nice on the French Riviera and Faro in Portugal.

Despite the mixed conditions forecast for the weekend, one company has reported rocketing sales of barbecues for this time of year.

Dobbies Garden Centre, which has stores across the country from Preston to Milton Keynes, said sales of barbecues were up 84 per cent compared to last year.

The garden centre retailer said last week was its best week ever for barbecue sales, with many getting ready for this weekend’s Bank Holiday.

It has also recorded a sharp rise in sales of outdoor furniture, with purchases up 58 per cent so far this year.

Many seem to have prepared for the typical British outdoors though, with dozens also investing in patio heaters, with sales up 49 per cent, and solar lighting, which saw sales rise by 78 per cent.
