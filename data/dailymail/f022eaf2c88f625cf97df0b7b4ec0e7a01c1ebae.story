Contestants on Jeopardy often get the difficult final question wrong, but the current champion had reason to be embarrassed of her performance Monday since she had the answer all along.

On Monday night's Jeopardy episode, the three contestants were given a clue about a sign or symbol. 'Meant to evoke a person with arms outstretched and pointed downward, it was designed in 1958 by Gerald Holtom,' the clue read.

The answer to the clue was a peace 
sign, a symbol that leading champion Sandie Baker of Eastpointe, 
Michigan was wearing the whole time on her earrings. 

Whoops! The answer to Monday's night's final Jeopardy clue was a peace sign, the very symbol champion Sandie Baker was wearing as earrings

But Baker didn't get the answer right, and neither did the other two contestants.

Luckily for Baker, she was well ahead of the other two contestants and won Jeopardy anyway, but getting the final clue wrong was nonetheless embarrassing for the Hewlett-Packard employee.

She posted a story of her final 
jeopardy flub on her personal Facebook on  Tuesday, writing 'Well, I 
should have seen this coming...'

Ms Baker is still in the tournament after winning Tuesday night's game, bringing her total five-day winnings to $115,000

Stumped: All three contestants got the answer wrong

Champion: Ms Baker drew a blank, but won the game anyway since she was so far ahead. She continued on through Tuesday night's game as well
