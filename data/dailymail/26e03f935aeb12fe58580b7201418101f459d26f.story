Plenty of shoppers get a warm glow when their basket of goodies from Poundland comes to under a tenner.

So imagine the feeling of saving literally  thousands – on the sale of a home.

That could be a reality after Poundland tycoon Steve Smith set his sights on a new target…the estate agent.

Entrepreneur: Poundland tycoon Steve Smith, pictured outside his mansion in Shropshire, has set his sites on the property market, and says Britons should be paying thousands less when selling their home

New venture: The founder of the cut-price chain has started the site which will charge customers as little as £195 to list their homes on the internet

He thinks Britons should be able to sell their homes for as little as £390 plus VAT and claims to have found a way of shaking up traditional chains by replacing commission rates with low priced fixed costs.

Mr Smith has teamed up with the founder of dating website Match to develop the EstatesDirect website.

Until now, individuals have been restricted from directly placing their homes on many of the property websites, being forced instead to pay high charges to agents.

For £195, Mr Smith’s basic service will list homes on property websites such as Zoopla and Rightmove, bridging the gap between online and high street estate agents.

It will also employ regional agents who provide local knowledge and meet with customers on a one-to-one basis.

Changes: Mr Smith, pictured in the kitchen of his luxury home, wants to give sellers more control and eradicate hefty commission fees

Market: EstatesDirect will act as an intermediary fielding calls from prospective buyers and setting up viewings. However, homeowners will still have to put up for sale signs

EstatesDirect will act as an intermediary fielding calls from prospective buyers and setting up viewings. However, homeowners will have to show off their own homes and put up for sale signs.

The site does offer a range of extras – such as negotiations on your behalf and glossy brochures – but these cost more.

If the house sells, the vendor pays another £195. A prestige service, for a flat rate of £1495 when the property is sold, includes glossy brochures and a choice of For Sale boards.

Mr Smith said: ‘For us, it’s all about giving sellers more control and removing the hefty commission fees associated with the traditional estate agency model.

‘We have ambitions to make EstatesDirect.com the UK’s largest, single branded, personal estate agency network within the next few years.’ 

The website is also aiming to slash the costs involved with finding tenants for properties. For a basic £45 it will search for tenants, check their credentials and produce a tenancy agreement.

The idea is to bring together services offered by High Street chains and online property websites.

Mr Smith said: ‘More than 95per cent of home movers now search for property online and it is predicted that within a few years, 60-70 per cent of all properties on the market will be listed by online estate agents.

'Yet, we know that homeowners and landlords still value the knowledge and service they receive from experts in the field.’

The website is also aiming to slash the costs involved with finding tenants for properties.

For a basic £45 it will search for tenants for a nine month period and check their credentials, produce a tenancy agreement, give legal advice, and collect the first month’s rent and deposit.

Originally launched regionally in 2012, the firm refined its business model and sold and let more than 450 properties.

It is now seeking to raise funds to expand itself by taking small sums from the general public in exchange for equity. However such so called crowd funding is high risk.

With estate agents charging between 1.5 and  2 per cent of the ultimate sale price, buyers could easily fork out £10,000 in fees when selling a £500,000 property, with other costs such as conveyancing fees to pay on top.

A growing number of online-only estate agents now charge a fraction of that cost.For a basic upfront flat fee of £195, EstatesDirect.com will list homes on property  websites for nine months.

For the premium service, which costs up to £2,490 if the house sells, they will send staff to conduct viewings  of your home. As it offers its services for a flat fee, the more expensive your home, the more you stand to save.

On average, EstatesDirect.com claims to save customers £2,896 plus VAT, based on a traditional agent’s commission of 1.5 per cent.
