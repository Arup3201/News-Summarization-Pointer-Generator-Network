Environmental health officers sent to look at a 'filthy' takeaway were swamped by a swarm of flies when they opened its kitchen door.

The walls, floors, appliances and surfaces of the curry and pizza shop in Royton, Oldham, were also covered in dirt with some even splattered with blood, inspectors found.

Naz’s Ltd, who own Royton Tandoori and Pizza Centre, has admitted nine breaches of food hygiene regulations in court.

The company was ordered to pay £5,515 - £500 for each offence plus £1,015 costs - by Oldham magistrates.

Ruth Crimmins, prosecuting on behalf of Oldham council, described the shocking scene that greeted the inspectors when they arrived on August 2.

'In the kitchen, there were flies swarming around the premises. They were dropping on to work surfaces. A fly dropped on the head of [one] inspector as she was walking underneath. There was also no fly screen to the rear door and the door frame was filthy,' she said

Mrs Crimmins added that walls, floors, freezers - one with a blood-splattered lid - sink, chopping boards, cloths and staff uniforms were dirty.

'An extractor had not been repaired for a year and a can opener was encrusted with debris.

'The customer waiting area was very hot and smoky.'

Manager and chef Mohammed Ullah was in court to hear the catalogue of failings read out. Mrs Crimmins added: 'No anti-bacterial cleaners were available and when asked, Mr Ullah said they must have run out. A member of staff then produced a can of furniture polish.

'Packets of frozen fish were defrosting next to a bucket of lettuce and raw meat left next to pizza bases.

'Mr Ullah was not aware of the possibility of cross- contamination.

'He had attended a safer food workshop in September 2007 and had been trained in food hygiene but clearly that training was not being put into practice.

'If these premises had not been inspected by the food hygiene people, I dread to think what could have been the outcome.'

Inspectors served a hygiene improvement notice and returned a week later to find the premises had been cleaned.

Atiyah Malik, defending, said the company accepted things had not been up to the standard required by law.

But he said it had been a temporary deviation - adding that the takeaway had enjoyed a three-star hygiene rating since February.

She said: 'Mr Ullah and his daughter had been subject to harassment which resulted in criminal proceedings against an individual.

'Mr Ullah spent less and less time at the premises and the running of it was left to his second-in-command.'

She said a health and safety consultant had been hired, a steam cleaner bought and a cleaning rota put in place.

Jacqui Knowles, chairwoman of the bench, told Ullah: 'We are pleased that, since the inspection, standards have improved.

'We hope you will maintain and improve these standards.'
