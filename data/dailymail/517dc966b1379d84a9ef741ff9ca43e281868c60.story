A British man was found with his head cut off in his Kenyan apartment on Friday.

The man, named locally as Peter Ironside and believed to be in his seventies, had lain for two weeks in a bathroom in the Bamburi area of port city of Mombasa. He had suffered multiple wounds from a machete.

A woman in her early thirties - reported to be his girlfriend - has been arrested on suspicion of murder. The Sun reported he had moved to Kenya several years ago to live with her.

Police discovered the body after neighbours became worried that he had not been seen at the apartment, situated in the popular tourist area.

One said there they heard shouts coming from the property before the man's disappearance. Another said: He was killed in a very dehumanising manner.'

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We are aware of the death of British National on Saturday 30 November in Mombasa, Kenya.Â  We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'

Kenyan police said they had arrested one suspect.

The incident comes just days after attackers targeted British tourists in Kenya in a grenade attack in Kenya - but the explosive failed to detonate.

The assailants quickly fled after hurling the grenade at a minibus carrying the tourists as it drove through the Likoni district of Mombasa, Kenya's main port city.

The grenade struck the vehicle's window but bounced off before landing on the ground without exploding, in a rare attack specifically targeting travellers in Kenya.

The attack came as Kenya celebrates its 50 years of independence from former colonial rulers Britain.

Kenya has seen a wave of attacks since its forces invaded southern Somalia in October 2011 to help oust Al Qaeda-linked insurgents from the militant group al-Shabaab.

Home-grown groups including the Islamist Al-Hijra group, a radical organisation formerly known as the Muslim Youth Centre, operate on Kenya's coast and have been linked to al-Shabaab.

Several radical Muslim preachers have been assassinated in Mombasa sparking riots by their supporters, who have accused the police of carrying out the killings, claims they strongly deny.

Grenades have been hurled into restaurants in Mombasa and crowded areas in the capital Nairobi, as well as a string of attacks in the remote northeast region bordering Somalia.

Al-Shabaab also claimed the brutal September assault on Nairobi's upmarket Westgate mall, a centre popular with foreigners, in which at least 67 people died in a four-day siege.
