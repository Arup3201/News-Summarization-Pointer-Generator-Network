Family heirlooms are typically treasured and carefully handed down from generation to generation.

And while this vintage motorcycle has been passed from parents to child for nearly a century, it has barely stood the test of time, after being left to gather dust in a shed.

Now, after decades spent forgotten, the 1923 Matchless J Type motorcycle has emerged for auction - and will hopefully be sold to someone willing to lavish some care and attention on it.

A real rust bucket: The bike is set to be auctioned by Charterhouse next month and the family hope it will be restored to its former glory

Motorcycles like this one rarely come on the market in original condition, and the Matchless is expected to fetch a lot of interest

In need of some TLC - and some oil! The bike has an 855cc twin engine, which packed quite a punch in its day

The rusty bike with sidecar was originally bought by Alec Wells in 1923 and has stayed in his family ever since.

After Alec passed away in 1955 the motorbike were looked after by his son Eric.

When Eric died in 2010 his sons Paul and Alec Wells found the old motorbikes locked away in a shed on the property.

As the motorbikes hadn’t been out on the road for more than 50 years the two had forgotten all about them.

Paul, 54, a landscape gardener from Blandford in Dorset, said he hoped the car would rev up some interest from enthusiastic collectors.

With its original owner: Alec Wells on his beloved bike in the 1930. Now his grandsons are selling the 1923 Matchless J Type motorcycle with sidecar, which was was found in their barn

He said: 'It’s amazing really. I remember sometimes we would sit on the bikes in the shed and play around as kids.

'My mother Jean remembers riding in the sidecar in the late 1950s.

'It can be great fun turning something from a wreck into a great condition.

'This age of bike just doesn't come up very often so hopefully there will be a lot of interest in them.'

Matthew Whitney, a motorcycle expert at Charterhouse, said it is extremely rare for a collection of motorbikes to have been in the same family for almost a century.

He said: 'It is a truly amazing discovery and the motorcycles have been amassed by one Dorset family.

A real labour of love! The new owner will need to overhaul the bike from it's wheels to its horn

A spring in your seat!The bikes and sidecars were still being used in the 1950s, but lay unused for years

Matchless is a stalwart of British motorcycle history.

It is one of the oldest marques, manufactured in Plumstead, London, between 1899 and 1966.

It was founded by Henry Herbert Collier, one of the first British motorcycle designers.

It originally began as a bicycle company, but then progressed to attach engines to the designs, before producing motorcycles. 

The brand eventually disappeared in 1966 after a series of mergers by 
parent company AMC, which swallowed its name into obscurity.

'Ripe for restoration is the 1923 Matchless J Type motorcycle with sidecar.

'It is just incredible to think it has has been in the same family ownership since it was bought new all those years ago.

'We occasionally joke about old vehicles with one owner from new, but one family ownership for nearly 100 is the longest ownership I have ever come across.

'Rarely do motorcycles such as these come on the market in original condition and they represent a fantastic opportunity for collectors to buy a piece of early motorcycle history.'

The 1923 Matchless motorcycle pulled out of the barn has an 855cc twin engine, which packed quite a punch in its day.

In addition to this Matchless motorcycle, there are also several other large twin motorcycles from the 1920s in barn find condition.

Various spare engines, frames, tanks and other parts now looking to be restored will also be up for auction.

The motorcycles will be auctioned by Charterhouse on February 10.
