Lazar Markovic will take Liverpool’s spending towards £60million on Tuesday when he is confirmed as Brendan Rodgers’ fourth summer signing.

The Serbia international arrived on Merseyside on Sunday night ahead of completing a two-part medical at Spire Liverpool Hospital and the club’s Melwood training ground after Liverpool triggered the £20million release clause in his Benfica contract.

Markovic arrived at Anfield later, posing with a club shirt.

Wanted: Liverpool have met the £20million release clause in Lazar Markovic's Benfica contract

Imminent: Markovic has flown into Merseyside to complete his medical and could sign within 24 hours

Pointing the way: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has already been very busy in the market this summer

Liverpool have been pursuing Markovic all
 summer – he was a target long before it became inevitable that Luis 
Suarez would join Barcelona – and they acted quickly to land one of the 
most highly-regarded young players in Europe.

Markovic, who played a crucial role in helping Benfica win the Portuguese title last season, has agreed a long-term contract at Anfield and he joins Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and Emre Can as new additions to a squad that finished runners-up to Manchester City in May.

The 20-year-old, a highly-rated left-sided attacker, will not be Liverpool’s final signing of the window by any means, with Belgium striker Divock Origi also close to joining Liverpool, while they are exploring reviving a deal for in Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno.

Liverpool are considering moves for, among others, Swansea pair Wilfried Bony and Ben Davies, QPR striker Loic Remy and they have not lost interest in Croatia defender Dejan Lovren, even though Southampton are standing firm. Borussia Dortmund’s Marco Reus, however, is not a target.

It is set to be a summer of change at Anfield , as a number of players, including Lucas Leiva and Daniel Agger, could leave; while Iago Aspas is set to complete a loan move to Sevilla with a view to a permanent £4.5m deal following talks between the two clubs.

Liverpool returned to training last week and play their first pre-season friendly tomorrow in Copenhagen against Brondby; they then face Preston at Deepdale on Saturday before heading to the United States for a tour, where they will be joined by their six England internationals.

Shoring up: Liverpool still retain an interest in Southampton defender Dejan Lovren
