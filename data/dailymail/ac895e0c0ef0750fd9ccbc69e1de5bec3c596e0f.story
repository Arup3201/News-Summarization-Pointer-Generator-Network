For five years, gamers have been itching to get behind the wheel of another GRID game. And although DIRT: Showdown was a dead end, Codemasters are now back on track.

Whereas Showdown didn't quite know what it was, Grid 2's confidence is there for all to see. Be that in the glossy TV-style presentation, stirring cinematic audio or its garish LiveRoutes mechanic.

In similar vein to the brilliant Forza Horizon, Codemasters have tried to glue the single-player career together with a narrative. You play an up-and-coming racer, who's part of the World Series Racing (WSR) competition.

The fast and the furious: Other drivers will try and ram you off the road if you drive aggressively

You'll have to go through different leagues, racing in a variety of locations from the Middle East, US and Asia - taking part in challenges such as timed laps and point-to-point races. It's a simple premise, but the high-quality ESPN endorsed cutscenes throughout help give an air of authenticity about what you're doing.

Sadly, the buzz of watching your fan base grow is hampered by the limited number of tracks becoming overly similar a few league wins in. Thankfully, LiveRoutes - where courses are changed randomly as you play through them - helps stave off some of this monotony - even though it's not entirely successful.

Grid veterans will struggle with just how ruthlessly a circuit can change - bombarding you with hairpins and tight bends that make it nigh on impossible not to crash. A flashback mechanic does allow you to wind back time if you've crashed or fluffed a corner - but you can only use it a limited number of times.

Thankfully, GRID 2's gameplay is fantastic - walking an elegant tightrope between arcade racer and simulator. Mastering the drift, though, takes longer than you would imagine.

Car models look very impressive and the sense of speed is well-realised. Add to the mix lush, dynamic environments and a medley of growling exhaust notes, and it's a compelling package in full flight.

Away from the track and there's plenty of customisation. You can create your own races and change the appearance of your car but sadly, performance-related mods are saved just for multiplayer.

One track mind: To get the best out of GRID 2, you must learn how to master the drift

Minor gripes aside, GRID 2 is still a great racing game - and a worthy lap of honour for our aging current gen consoles.

GRID 2 is out now.
