Sitting by a bin and puffing on a cigarette, it is hard to believe she is normally a byword for glamour.

But this was model turned actress Jerry Hall yesterday as she arrived for work at the Richmond Theatre in South West London.

Miss Hall, 58, wore heavy make-up, fur-lined coat and boots – and what appeared to be an engagement ring. 

Formerly married to Mick Jagger for nine years, she has been dating evolutionary biologist Armand Leroi, 50.

Miss Hall had been single since splitting from Australian multi-millionaire Warwick Hemsley, 61, in 2012.

Miss Hall is back in her role as the Wicked Queen in Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs after missing several shows since December 21. 

She took the pantomime role in a blaze of publicity and was watched by her former husband and three of their four children – James, 29, Georgia, 22, and Gabriel, 16, although eldest daughter Lizzie, 30, could not be there. 

But some fans criticised her on social media, unimpressed by her no-show. 

Fiona Adams wrote on Twitter: 'Arrived @richmondtheatre to see jerry hall as the evil queen and find she's 'indisposed'. Boo, hiss... maybe the dwarves got her.'

Two days later, Susie Davidson Powell, from Brent, London, added: 'Panto time at Richmond Theatre! Jerry Hall suddenly indisposed? Bah humbug. The cast still sparkled!'

Laura Garnham wrote: 'No Jerry Hall was a shocker.'

But her agent said Miss Hall was struck down with flu.  

'She has had a really bad virus,' Jonathan Phang said last night. 'It has been really upsetting for her as she has never missed any performances before in her career. She is not 100 per cent but she is working so hard and she is battling through.'

Mr Phang said Miss Hall was ordered to rest by her doctor, who signed her off for two weeks – but she insisted on returning much sooner. 

'She is doing two shows a day. It is a gruelling schedule. She didn't want to contaminate the cast,' he said.

Miss Hall, a patron of Richmond Theatre, had faced criticism for her performances after members of the audience noticed she was miming her musical numbers.

The production team confirmed a backing track was used, saying it was 'common practice'.

The theatre said: 'Jerry Hall was advised by her doctor to rest... but returned fit and well on Boxing Day with performances as good as ever.'
