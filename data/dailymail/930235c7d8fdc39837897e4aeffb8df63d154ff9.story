Students who attend former polytechnics are more likely to be unemployed or in low-skilled jobs at the end of their degree compared to those who go to more traditional universities.

New figures revealed that graduates from universities such as London South Bank, London Metropolitan and Birmingham City are twice as likely to end up unemployed at the end of their degree compared to those from 'red brick' institutions such as Newcastle and Edinburgh.

However the figures revealed that Oxford University - one of the most respected education establishments in the world - was falling behind Huddersfield, East Anglia and Hull universities in employment rates.

David Willetts, the Universities Minister - speaking to the Daily Telegraph - said the figures showed that some universities would have to 'raise their game'.

The figures revealed that one in five graduates from some of the country's newer universities failed to find a job within six months last year - compared with one in ten elsewhere.

They also highlighted the devastating effect the recession has had on jobs opportunities for graduates with almost 20,000 former students still out of work six months after finishing their courses.

This is a 50 per cent increase since before the recession.

And instead of being in high-flying professional jobs -Â  as they may have expected before starting university - thousands of graduates have been forced to take low-skilled work as shelf-stackers, bar staff and cleaners.

The figures - released by the Higher Education Statistics Agency - showed that 94 per cent of new graduates who attended the universities of Edinburgh and Newcastle had found a job or begun postgraduate study within six months.

A similar success rate was seen at Bristol, Reading, Cambridge, St Andrews and Aberdeen universities.

However just 78 per cent of those who graduated from the University of East London were in work or further study within six months. The picture was similar at many other former polytechnics.

A total of 90.2 per cent of Oxford graduates were either working or doing further study within six months of completing their degree last year.

This is down from its own figure of 92.6 per cent from the previous year and below the national average of 90.4 per cent.

A spokesman for Oxford University told the Daily Telegraph that the rise in unemployed Oxford students was down to a drop in the numbers choosing to go into postgraduate study, possibly as a result of the financial climate.
