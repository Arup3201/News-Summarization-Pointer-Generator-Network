A former minister has warned that high-stakes casino-style gambling machines in betting shops cause violence which can spill out into the high street.

Stephen Timms said the fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs) – branded the crack cocaine of gambling – were so addictive that users were often sent into a fury if they did not win.

He said one betting chain had been forced to upgrade the reinforcement of its machines because they had been damaged so often by angry users. And he claimed the violence and abuse they cause inside betting shops is being continued out on to the street.

The former Treasury Minister was giving evidence at Thames Magistrates’ Court where bookmaker Paddy Power is challenging a decision to block a licence for a new shop in Newham, East London.

Newham Council states that betting shops fuel violent crime, street drinking and underage gambling.

It claims that bookmakers are  targeting poorer areas such as Newham with the roulette-style FOBTs, which can take stakes of up to £100 a spin every 20 seconds.

Newark already has 81 betting shops, with 18 on one road alone.

Mr Timms, the Labour MP for East Ham, said: ‘The proliferation of these shops and these very addictive  terminals within them is destroying people’s lives. We are seeing families broken up and houses repossessed.

‘What happens is that people who lose money in these shops become very angry. I’m told Paddy Power has had to upgrade the robustness of the machines because people so often try to bash them up. And that is what often spills out on to the high street.’

Mr Timms, now shadow minister of state for employment, added: ‘Betting shops attract anti-social behaviour, including street drinking.

‘Some people tell me they walk a considerable distance to avoid it. It’s intimidating and stops people using the high street for what it is meant to be used for: shopping.’

Mr Timms was a member of the Labour government that brought in the 2005 Gambling Act which many claim has led to the proliferation of the casino-style machines.

However, he claimed the technology behind the machines has developed quicker than ministers at the time could have expected.

He said: ‘As a Treasury Minister I formed the view there was quite a sense of responsibility within the betting industry.

Now it seems to have been entirely lost since the proliferation of these machines.’Newham Council initially wanted to make this licensing decision a test case that could halt the tide of FOBTs taking over the high street.

It had employed a private detective to compile evidence from inside betting shops in the borough on the use of the machines. The report found up to 82 per cent of customers in Newham betting shops used FOBTs.

But District Judge Paul Goldspring has declined to hear the evidence, claiming the machines were the primary source of profit for any future betting shop.
