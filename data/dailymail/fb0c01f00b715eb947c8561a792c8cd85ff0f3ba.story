Having been welcomed home to a huge reception in Berlin, Germany's World Cup winners have added an extra leg to their tour by landing in Munich to another large crowd.

Following showing off the World Cup trophy in the German capital on Tuesday in front of half-a-million fans at Brandenburg Gate, the squad's more southern based players - including their Bayern Munich core - travelled south and greeted fans after arriving in Bavaria.

Bastian Schweinsteiger looked especially overjoyed as he stepped off the plane on the red carpet, bowing down to his knees to acknowledge the locals who came out to greet the new world champions.

Manuel Neuer, Philipp Lahm, Thomas Muller were the other Bayern Munich stars to land back on familiar turf, with Toni Kroos also present although the midfielder is close to completing a £20million switch to Real Madrid.

Joining the Munich stars was Mats Hummels, with the Borussia Dortmund defender among the travelling party from Berlin where the squad paraded the trophy on Tuesday.

Germany had arrived home from Brazil at 10am local time on Tuesday and were greeted at the airport by excited fans trying to get a glimpse of the World Cup as they made their way through the terminal.

During their 11-hour flight it was reported in German newspaper Bild that the Germany players managed to get some rest. After partying on Monday to celebrate their fourth World Cup triumph, there was a reported hour delay after a baggage carrier had touched the plane.

Germany won their fourth World Cup and their first as unified nation after defeating Argentina in extra time courtesy of a Mario Gotze extra time strike.
