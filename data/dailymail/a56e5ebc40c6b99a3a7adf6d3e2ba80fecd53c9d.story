It is unlikely that Amazon Kindle will need to watch its back anytime soon.

British supermarket giant J Sainsbury today entered the e-book and social network market after buying what it says will be a 64 per cent stake in Anobii.

The company paid a nominal £1 for HMV's shareholding in the social network, which is aimed at readers and currently has over 600,000 users worldwide and a library of 60,000 e-books.

Among its other shareholders are publishers HarperCollins, Penguin and Random House.

The purchase follows last November's launch of Sainsbury's Entertainment and the launch of a music download service earlier this year.

Sainsbury's also acquired online entertainment company Global Media Vault in October 2011.

E-readers are becoming increasingly popular - digital book sales rose 54 per cent in 2011, accounting for 8 per cent of all book sales. They made up just 5 per cent in 2010.

There are more than a dozen types of device on the market now.

Some are dedicated readers which display the printed word in a format that is easy to read (with no back-light); they can be used even in broad daylight.

Many can browse the Internet but this is not their main function. These include the Amazon Kindle, Kobo, Sony devices, and Nook.

Each has its own online marketplace for books - Kindle users buy only from Amazon's online bookstore, while Kobo and Nook users buy from Barnes and Noble, and Sony users from its Reader Store. There are others too, including Anobii.

Other types of device such as iPads, tablet PCs and smartphones now have e-reader apps which allow you to download books. These are basically full-colour Internet browsing and gaming devices.

Mark 
Bennett, the firm's head of digital entertainment, praised Anobii’s use 
of reader recommendations and discussions through its own website and 
social media platforms including Facebook.

He said: 'Anobii’s innovative use of social media is a clear differentiator.

'This acquisition is a valuable addition to our digital portfolio and shows our commitment to becoming a key player in the digital entertainment market '

The deal supports the supermarket's drive into the growing online and digital entertainment market, Mr Bennett said.

Last month, a poll revealed that many e-book users like to read racy fare as e-reader devices 'free' fans from having to show what they're reading.

Around a third of e-book users read erotic novels on their devices, confident that others cannot see them.

In a poll of 1,863 people conducted in Britain, 34 per cent admitted to having read erotic novels on the devices.

Another 57 per cent said that they used their e-reader to hide the fact that they were reading children’s books, such as Harry Potter, while 26 per cent said they used theirs to disguise their sci-fi books habit.

Overall, 58 per cent of people admit to using their device to 'hide' what they are reading, according to the poll by MyVoucherCodes.co.uk.
