A dementia sufferer was left locked on a bus for almost three hours after staff from the Alzheimer’s Society forgot to drop her off at home.

The unnamed woman, believed to be in her 80s, had used the free shuttle service which takes patients with dementia from their homes to day care services.

However, staff on board the bus forgot to ensure she got off the vehicle and she remained locked inside when it returned to the Middlefields depot in South Shields, South Tyneside.

Stranded: A dementia sufferer was left locked on a bus inside this depot in South Shields, South Tyneside, for almost three hours after staff from the Alzheimer’s Society forgot to drop her off at home

She was eventually found by workers at the depot, after they heard her screams and shouts for help.

The vehicle is thought to have been parked up by a worker from charity Alzheimer’s Society at around 4pm and the woman was discovered at 6.30pm.

Even then her ordeal was still not over and she was not able to return home for another two hours because council staff had to be called to release her from the minibus.

A council employee, who asked not to be named, said: 'She was screaming and shouting and she was really upset, crying and cold.

'She had been there for hours. If someone hadn’t have found her, she wouldn’t have lasted the night. If it was my mother or nana, I would be absolutely disgusted.'

Locked in: The vehicle is thought to have been parked up at the depot by a worker from charity Alzheimer’s Society at around 4pm and the woman was discovered at 6.30pm.

Two workers from the Alzheimer’s Society have been suspended while an investigation is carried out.

The charity has carried out an initial report into what happened to the woman on Tuesday, November 4, but is continuing to investigate.

'Alzheimer’s Society takes the wellbeing and safety of everyone using our services very seriously,' said Alzheimer’s Society regional director Helen Foster.

'On this occasion mistakes were made that led to this very unfortunate incident.

'We have apologised whole-heartedly to the individual and their family that in this instance we fell below the standard of care and support that we usually deliver in the care of our vulnerable service users.

“We are sorry for the distress that this has caused to the family.

'An internal investigation was launched immediately into the circumstances under which this incident took place and a full report has now been completed as a result.

“Two members of staff have also been suspended. Strict and comprehensive protocols have been now been put in place to ensure the safety of individuals travelling home from our services in the future.'

A spokesman for South Tyneside Council said: 'From the moment we became aware of this incident, we took action and continue to take the matter extremely seriously.

'We have been in communication with the Alzheimer’s Society from an early stage and have urged them to identify exactly what went wrong on this occasion and to review procedures in consultation with our officers.

'Our priority is to ensure that users of services funded by the council are well looked after and safe.

'The council is considering what further action needs to be taken under the contract and we will be discussing that with the Alzheimer’s Society in the coming days.'
