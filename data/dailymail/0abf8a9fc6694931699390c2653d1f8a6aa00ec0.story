Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has called on his European Union partners for help with the immigration crisis

Malta is overwhelmed by the ‘unsustainable’ numbers of migrants arriving on its shores, the country's Prime Minister has warned.

In a desperate appeal to other EU leaders, centre-left leader Joseph Muscat said the boatloads of Africans arriving created 'a national security problem ’.

The Mediterranean island, with a population of just 400,000, has become the landing point for many of the migrants seeking a new life in Europe.

Since the beginning of the Arab 
Spring tens of thousands have made the journey, often in overcrowded and
dangerous wooden boats. Many arrive in Malta or the Italian island of 
Lampedusa, hoping to gain access to other parts of the European Union.

Speaking
in Rome, Mr Muscat said Malta was being forced to accept a number of 
migrants equivalent to 800,000 migrants to the UK or a million to 
Germany or Spain.

In the past year some 2,000 immigrants have arrived on the island by boat, he said.

He said: ‘The people of Malta are not racist and welcome multiculturalism. We are in favour of integration.

‘But the burden should not fall on two countries, one of which is the smallest country in the EU,’ he said.

Malta’s situation is even worse than 
Lampedusa’s, because the migrants who arrived on the Italian island stay
only a few days before they are transferred to Sicily, he said.

Under EU rules, those that land in Malta are not allowed to leave the country.

Boatloads of refugees land on the paradise beaches of Malta in search of a life in Europe but the island's prime minister has warned the numbers has created 'a national security problem'

Having
helped to bail out the banks of his European neighbours Malta, which 
contributes three per cent of its GDP to the EU, more than any other 
country, expected more ‘solidarity’ from EU countries, he said.

Mr Muscat said: ‘Empty words on solidarity are no longer enough. We have happily bailed out Greece..then Cyprus.

‘Europe was quick in rescuing banks but too slow in rescuing people.’

The
European Court of Human Rights last week forced Malta to cancel two 
flights repatriating migrants to Libya after an 11th hour appeal by 
NGOs.

The NGOs said this was the same policy of "push back" that was declared illegal by the court after it was used by Italy in 2009.

Today, Mr Muscat said the deportation of migrants to Africa was still a possibility. ‘We cannot rule out any options’ he said.
