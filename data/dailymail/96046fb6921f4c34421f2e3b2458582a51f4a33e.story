Police divers have searched a Gold Coast property belonging to the mother of pop star Rikki Lee Coulter for the body of a missing millionaire's wife, Novy Chardon.

Police divers searched dams on the farm Advancetown in the Gold Coast hinterland for the body of Novy Chardon, 34, the fifth wife of a millionaire who is in prison for raping a teenage girl.

It is the second major search for the Indonesian-born 34-year-old following her disappearance in February 2013 from the Mt Nathan mansion in the Gold Coast hinterland she shared with John Chardon, a multi-millionaire industrial lubricants manufacturer.

Body hunt: POlice divers searched a dam on the farm but found no trace of 34-year-old Novy Chardon, whose Indonesian mother said had argued with her millionaire husband over porperty and a divorce prior to her disapperance

In March last year, police searching Mr Chardon's property excavated a white utility buried under earth, sparking fears the missing woman might have been entombed in the vehicle.

Mr Chardon, 68, was in Indonesia with the couple's two young children at the time of the last search. He was subsequently convicted on unrelated offences last August for molesting and raping a friend's daughter when she was a 15-year-old schoolgirl between 1998 and 1999.

A major Liberal National party donor once praised in the Queensland state parliament and the principal of Candan Industries lubricant suppliers, the now disgraced John Chardon is serving a six year jail sentence for child molesting.

POlice (pictured during the search at Mt Nathan last year) found nothing but resumed their search on Wednesday at another Gold Coast property, which belongs to pop star Rikki Lee Coulter's, mother, where they sent divers in to the dams

Police and about 50 SES volunteers on Wednesday began searching an unoccupied 3.6km property at Advancetown, just 17km south of Chardon's former Mt Nathan home, which had links to a 'person of interest'.

Regional crime co-ordinator Superintendent Dave Hutchinson said the operation was a body search. 'We're searching for Novy's remains', he told the Gold Coast Bulletin.

Supt Hutchinson later said that not items of interest had been located, but the investigation would continue.

'Although we came up empty-handed today, our determination to solve this case remains as strong as ever,' he said.

After Ms Chardon vanished two years ago, her car was found dumped several suburbs away near Nerang Train Station.

SES volunters helped police search a Gold Coast property last year for Novy Chardon and were again out in force on Wednesday looking for the missing mother of two

Just two days after his wife disappeared, John Chardon took their two young children on a pre-planned business trip to Indonesia. He has always maintained his innocence of her murder.

He remained overseas for several weeks and at the time said Mrs Chardon had gone missing before and denied playing any part in her disappearance, despite previously being named in court as the chief suspect.

Put on trial last year for molesting and raping the daughter of a friend while she was a schoolgirl more than 15 years ago, Chardon denied the charges, claiming it was the teenage girl who offered him sex and he had turned her down after getting legal advice on the ramifications of sleeping with a minor.

He did admit he started a secret cash-for-sex relationship with the teenager once she came of age.

He continued to protest his innocence even after a jury of 12 found him guilty of six sex offences including rape and attempted rape.
