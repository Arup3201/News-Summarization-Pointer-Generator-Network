For a split-second, it could have been the opening day of last season. Same opposition, same score to protect and a contribution from the same player that brought the same, deafening reaction.

Deep into added time, with Liverpool clinging to a 1-0 lead, Charlie Adam hoisted a cross into the penalty area and Anfield gasped for breath. Through a sea of red shirts, Simon Mignolet appeared to pluck the ball from the sky and spark a thunderous ovation.

The reaction from the home support, however, was mixed with relief. Mignolet had previously came for but missed a number of balls slung in his direction and irony could be detected in the cheering.

But, at that moment, Mignolet ensured the game would be won. When referee Craig Pawson brought a tense contest to an end shortly after, Mignolet stood on the edge of the box, punching the air in celebration. His emotions needed no explanation. A weight had been lifted.

When Stoke arrived at Anfield in August 2013, Mignolet made an immediate impression on his debut, saving an added-time penalty from Jon Walters. That plunging stop launched Liverpool’s push for the title and it was the best possible introduction to his new fans.

He once described that as the ‘best moment of his career’ but, highlights have been few since. Liverpool are used to charismatic No 1s but Mignolet, for much of 2014, has done nothing but spread anxiety.

It meant the circumstances had significantly changed for this visit from Stoke. Mignolet had a huge question to answer, aware the criticism of him — most notably from former Liverpool keeper Bruce Grobbelaar — had been stinging.

Having spoken to Brendan Rodgers on Friday, Mignolet — whose error against Ludogorets in the Champions League ensured the spotlight was shining on him — knew that he had to produce.

That wasn’t always the case. He was heckled by The Kop at one point when he dithered over a goal kick; his kicking, as a whole, wasn’t always assured and his decision making was hesitant, notably in the second half when he allowed Mame Biram Diouf to close in on him.

As the pressure mounted, though, Mignolet produced, not least with a fabulous fingertip save to tip over a Bojan Krkic volley. Then, as Stoke tried to salvage a point, he made that catch and all was right in his world. The question is how long it will stay that way.
