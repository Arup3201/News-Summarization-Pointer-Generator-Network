The former wife of jailed sex offender Max Clifford has been pictured back with her first husband.

Divorcee Jo Westwood had married the now-disgraced public relations man Clifford in 2010, but distanced herself from him when he was charged and then tried on a string of sex attacks on women as young as 15.

In April, he was found guilty, then jailed for eight years – and three months ago their relationship ended with a ‘quckie’ divorce.

But Mrs Westwood is now being comforted by her previous ex-husband Lee, from whom she separated in 2003.

And to add insult to injury for Clifford, 71, his ex-wife and Mr Westood have been pictured enjoying time together in the Cotswolds village of Broadway in Wiltshire, at the £600,000 honey-coloured stone house the PR guru and his ex-wife used  as their country residence.

Mr Westwood has also reportedly been seen driving the £150,000 Bentley coupe Clifford bought his ex-wife as a wedding present.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, she has splashed out on new personalised licence plates for the car, swapping the letters MAX for JO.

Mrs Westwood, 51, was a volunteer bereavement counsellor for a children’s hospice in Guildford, Surrey, which Clifford became a patron of.

He later admitted that he turned to her for support after the death of his first wife, Liz, from cancer in 2003.

He began courting her and she worked as his assistant at his London offices. They married after she proposed to him on a golf course in Marbella, Spain.

She was notably absent from his trial, however, which featured claims he abused girls as young as 12, and allegations that his extraordinary grooming technique involved telling impressionable young women that he had an extremely small penis.

On the very day he was convicted she was seen walking near their Cotswold cottage – without her wedding ring.

Now he is in jail, but his ex-wife has reportedly been seen several times with her former husband, an IT consultant with whom she has a daughter.

According to the Daily Star Sunday they have been seen together at the house formerly owned by Clifford – and Mr Westwood has even been seen driving the wedding gift Bentley that used to have a MAX numberplate.

A source told the paper: ‘Jo and Lee are back together and they don’t care who sees.

‘They are like a couple of love-struck teenagers and they aren’t afraid to hide it.

‘Everyone in Broadway has seen them wandering around holding hands and going for meals in the village. They seem really happy.

‘It’s a real kick in the teeth for Max, but in a way Lee has got his own back for him stealing Jo in the first place.

‘Lee still has his own place but is spending most weekends with her in the house which she got in the divorce, and he’s even been driving the car Max got her after they got married.’

The Sunday paper also claimed Mrs Westwood had been seen visiting a jeweller’s with her ex-husband, and wearing a large ring.

The source told the newspaper: ‘All Jo’s family and friends are really pleased that after everything she’s been through she is happy again.

‘None of them ever really liked Max. He was a bully and really put her through the mill.

‘She’s had a really tough couple of years with the allegations against Max but she’s put it all behind her.

‘For the first time in ages she has a huge smile on her face.’

Mrs Westwood divorced Clifford on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour, saying he caused her stress and heart palpitations.
