It's the tantrum every parent knows all too well - the kicking and screaming when a child isn't paid their pocket money.

But when ten-year-old Xiao Wei's father was late in paying him his weekly 50p stipend, the stubborn youngster took matters into his own hands.

Rather than break some toys or sulk in his room, he climbed onto the window sill of the family's third-storey apartment... and threatened to jump if he wasn't paid in full and on time.

Incredibly, police in Shangsi county in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region said it was the fifth time he had threatened or attempted to end his life - part of a trend being mirrored across the country.

'I'm going to jump'! Rather than break some toys or sulk in his room, Xiao Wei climbed onto the window sill of the family's high-rise apartment... and threatened to jump if he wasn't paid in full and on time

Ultimate tantrum: Rather than break some toys or sulk in his room, he climbed onto the window sill of the family's third-storey apartment... and threatened to jump if he wasn't paid in full and on time

He has attempted to take his own life so many times over any lapse in his lifestyle remuneration that his father didn't even come to the scene - choosing to drink rice wine at home instead.

Police said that on one of the 
occasions when he had tried to kill himself his mother had to give him 
money on the ledge of a window to get him back inside. 

Another time he held a knife against his throat and threatened to slit his artery in protest at being asked to do his homework.

Looking on: He has attempted to take his own life so many times over any lapse in his lifestyle remuneration that his father didn't even come to the scene - choosing to drink rice wine at home instead

Protest at an end: After some thirty minutes on the sill, police finally persuaded the boy that his efforts were ultimately fruitless and he decided to give up his protest and come inside

TV inspired: When he was quizzed about where the idea had come from to end his life from a building leap, he said: 'I saw an adult doing it on TV'

And last month he actually did leap 
from an apartment building, but his fall was broken by telegraph and 
electrical cables and he was only slightly hurt.

According
 to the father, both he and his wife are 'common workers' unable to give
 into their sons endless demands for pocket money. 

'He is always comparing himself to kids who have more and thus becomes extremely dissatisfied,' said his dad.

Serial offender: Police said that on one of the occasions when he had tried to kill himself his mother had to give him money on the ledge of a window to get him back inside

Hard up: According to the father, both he and his wife are 'common workers' unable to give into their sons endless demands for pocket money

A
 baffled psychiatrist in the area said: 'Just as children can be 
conditioned to be violent by playing video games, so they mimic 
disturbed adult behaviour if they think it will serve their ends. It is 
happening more and more in our country.'

The boy sat on the windowsill shouting: 'I am going to jump!'

Rescuers pleaded with him for over an hour to see reason and come back inside.
