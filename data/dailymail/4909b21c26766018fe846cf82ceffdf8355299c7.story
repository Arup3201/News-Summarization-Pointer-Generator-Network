She may have been wearing an old dress, but the Duchess of Cambridge turned heads with a new haircut at the opening of the Natural History Museum’s Treasure exhibition in London last night.

Kate's new look appears to have been inspired by the late Seventies and early Eighties, with a heavy parted fringe reminiscent of Farah Fawcett.

But it was the combination of the new haircut and the retro silk green dress that brought to mind a more significant likeness: that of her husband's late mother, Princess Diana.

Inspiration: Kate's new look appears to have been inspired by the late Seventies and early Eighties

Diana wore an almost identical green silk chiffon dress during a 1983 tour as she was leaving Auckland, New Zealand, for a trip to the Bahamas.

Like Kate's £1,400 Mulberry dress (previously worn last November to launch the 
Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations at Buckingham Palace), Diana's was buttoned high, belted at the waist and gathered at the wrists creating a balloon sleeve.

Even their stances are the same, with hands clasped demurely in front.

Trusted stylist: Kate's new hairstyle - which also appears to be darker than before, is believed to have been created by her favourite hairdresser Richard Ward, who has a salon off Sloane Square, London

Signature look: Diana famously wore a heavy fringe, which fell across her eyes. Now it appears that Kate is following her lead

Kate's new hairstyle - which also 
appears to be darker than before, is believed to have been created by 
her favourite hairdresser Richard Ward, who has a salon off Sloane 
Square, London.

The Duchess was given a tour of a gallery 
featuring some of the museum’s greatest treasures, including rare first 
editions of Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species.

Opening the exhibition, she spoke about how she and her husband had enjoyed visits there in the past.

She said: ‘The Natural History Museum 
has a very special place in the heart of this nation.

'William and I are 
just two of millions of people who have passed through these doors, and 
marvelled at the spectacular wonders of the natural world, housed in 
this beautiful gallery.

‘I care passionately about what 
this museum stands for.  Being here tonight, seeing some of nature’s 
finest treasures, reminds me just how precious and awe inspiring the 
natural world is.

‘That is why the opening of 
Treasures is so incredibly exciting.  If it were ever needed, there is 
now even more reason to visit this wonderful museum.’

Treasures displays 22 of the most extraordinary specimens that have ever
been on show at the Museum, and opens 30 November to the public.

Dr Michael Dixon, Director of the Natural History Museum said: ‘We are thrilled Her Royal Highness joined us to celebrate the opening 
of Treasures. We hope that she is the first of many visitors to discover
everything the Museum represents in this special gallery.’

Part
Samantha Cameron, part Shy Di, the Duchess of Cambridge appeared to use
her newly-cut layers not to frame her famous face, but to shield it 
from the glare of the cameras.

And it would seem Catherine has not been tempted only by the stylist's scissors during her latest appointment.Her
has also taken on a distinctly chestnut hue - perhaps the result of a 
gentle, natural vegetable tint, designed to add extra gloss and 
light-reflecting properties to her always immaculate blow dry.

It’s not the first time Kate’s been associated with the classic British design house, Mulberry.

Michael Lendon, creative director of 
the Aveda hair institute, told Mail Online: 'Even minor changes attract 
huge attention and Kate has progressed her style to something a little 
more versatile.

'The new layers around the face will 
allow Kate to go for different styles. I think this could be the start 
of some new tricks from Kate in the hair department, expect some glam 
hair-ups as the shorter layers will make styling an up-do more fun. 
Without a doubt, the subtle new twist to her signature long locks will 
be a hit.'

In September Kate wore an elegant navy 
Mulberry dress for a visit to the tiny village of Marau, on day seven of
the Diamond Jubilee tour with Prince William.

She chose a sleeveless Nightshade Blue Broderie Anglaise dress, which she complimented with a matching patent belt.

It
is a busy week for Kate. Tomorrow, she and Prince William make their 
first official visit to Cambridge since he was conferred with the 
Dukedom on the eve of their wedding.

The
Prince of Wales' communications secretary is to leave his job after 
more than eight years in the post to launch a public relations company, 
it was announced today.

During
his time in office Paddy Harverson oversaw press relations during 
Charles' wedding to the Duchess of Cornwall in 2005 and the developing 
public profile of his sons the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

William
and Harry established their royal household away from their father's 
court of Clarence House, developed their own charitable interests and 
are pursuing careers in the Armed Forces.

Mr Harverson yesterday told Charles and his wife of his intention to leave and the royal couple were said to be 'sad' at the news but excited for their outgoing communications boss.

He will be launching his new venture with a friend who has a senior position with the online search engine Google with the aim of the new business to advise firms and high profile individuals.

Mr Harverson was Manchester United Football Club's communications director and before that worked at the Financial Times where he was the paper's sports correspondent, writing about the business world of sport.

The move comes at a turning point for Mr Harverson who will reach the milestone age of 50 next year and has a young family. It is understood he now wants to pursue other challenges after spending a long period working for Charles.

It is thought he will leave his post in the spring with a replacement appointed later next year.
