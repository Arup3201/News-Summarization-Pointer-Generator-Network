A mother gave birth to seven babies while hiding the pregnancy from her husband and strangled them to death immediately after they were born, authorities said today.

The infants' dead bodies were found hidden in cardboard boxes in 39-year-old Megan Huntsman's former garage in Pleasant Grove, Utah by her estranged husband.

Huntsman, 39, is accused of killing her babies after giving birth to the
 children between 1996 and 2006, investigators said. She admitted strangling six of them and wrapping their bodies in towels before hiding them at home. The other child was not alive when it was born.

Serial
 killer? Megan Huntsman is accused of killing seven of her own newborns
 and stuffing their bodies into boxes in the garage

Thin: Huntsman, seen in this 2010 photo with two unidentified individuals, has reportedly admitted to giving birth and strangling or suffocating all of the children between 1996 and 2006

Her husband Darren West is believed to
 have been living with her at the time of the killings, and found the 
bodies this month after returning home following a prison sentence for 
drug offences.

Huntsman also has three daughters — one teenager and two young adults — who lived at the house.

Police told The Deseret News that at least six of the seven children were born alive.

One of her neighbors spoke about how she was amazed that Huntsman was able to hide the pregnancies from the community.

'She always looked kind of slim, I mean, to have this many babies full term, it’s like... Where were they?' Kathie Hawker said.

Hiding: Several people, including this person in sweat pants, were seen taking bags of items from the home where the grisly discovery was made on Sunday

Connections: Megan Huntsman is in jail but she and her estranged husband have three teenage and adult daughters, though the young woman seen leaving the home has not been identified

Getting out of the house: A friend was seen helping the person in sweats get bags out of the home on Monday

Ms Hawker told Fox 13 the mother of three left the home that year while battling a 'substance abuse problem.'

'She was not in good health’ when she moved out, said Kathie Hawker, adding ‘we were worried about the children who lived there with her.’

Other neighbor Sharon Chipman said that wile she had noticed some fluctuations in weight but nothing to suggest multiple pregnancies.

Roberts said police believe West and Huntsman were together when the babies were born.

 samples taken from the suspect and her husband will determine 
definitively whether the two are the parents, as investigators believe.

Late Sunday, West's family issued a statement saying they were in a 'state of shock and confusion.'

'We
 are mourning this tragic loss of life and we are trying to stay strong 
and help each other through this awful event,' the statement said before
 asking for privacy.

West 
pleaded guilty in federal court in 2005 to two counts of possessing 
chemicals intended to be used in manufacturing methamphetamine, court 
records show. In August 2006, he was sentenced to nine years in prison, 
but appealed the term three times. He maintained his innocence and said 
he never had any intention to manufacture meth. It is unclear when he 
was released.

West's sister Sarah Wright wrote to federal district court in 2006, saying West is a good father to his three daughters.

'Darren is such an awesome dad,' she wrote.

The
 gruesome case has raised a series of questions about how the killings 
occurred despite Huntsman carrying out what neighbors seemed like a 
normal existence.

Police declined to comment on a motive and what Huntsman said during an interview with investigators.

Police Capt. Michael Roberts said 
officers responded to a call from West on Saturday about a dead infant, 
and then they found the six other bodies.

Family and neighbors identified the estranged husband as Darren West, who has been in prison on drug-related charges.

Roberts said police believe West and Huntsman were together when the babies were born.

'We don't believe he had any knowledge of the situation,' Roberts told The Associated Press

Asked how the man could not have known about the situation, Roberts replied,

'That's the million-dollar question. Amazing.'

Huntsman
 moved out several years ago, leaving her three daughters, one teenager 
and two young adults, to live alone, their neighbors the Hawkers said. 
They weren't sure where Huntsman has since been living.

What she did: Huntsman has been charged with six counts of murder, but it is unclear why she has not been charged with seven since that many bodies were found

Years ago, Huntsman baby-sat the Hawker grandchildren and they were friendly with each other.

'It makes us so sad, we want to cry,' Kathie Hawker said. 'We enjoyed having them as a neighbor. This has just blown us away.'

Aaron Hawker said he talked with West on Saturday morning. He told Hawker he was cleaning out the mess in the garage.

'Two hours later, suddenly we had all these policemen here,' Aaron Hawker said.

Fred
 Newman, a neighbor whose cousin is the husband's mother, said he's 
perplexed how the three oldest daughters living there didn't know about 
what police say was going on.

 the scene: Authorities investigate a crime scene where they say seven

Chain of custody: Megan Huntsman had been living in the home that legally belongs to her estranged husband's parents

Not a suspect: West had just returned to the Pleasant Grove home after spending time in jail

He said the girls didn't always park their cars in the garage, but did sometimes in the cold winter months.

'What's shocking is the three older ones living there and not noticing that their mother was pregnant,' Newman said.

He said he has used his snow-blower to clean off the driveway of the home and the young women would thank him.

The girls were normal youngsters, coming and going often, neighbor Vickie Nelson said.

'It's shocking and kind of morbid and strange,' Nelson said as he looked across the street at the garage from her from lawn.
