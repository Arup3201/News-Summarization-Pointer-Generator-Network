The number of babies born last year was the highest in more than 40 years, according to official figures.

There were nearly 724,000 newborn children in England and Wales, the greatest number since 1971, at the tail end of the 1960s baby boom.

A key reason for the rising numbers of babies is the large-scale immigration of the past decade, which has brought in mainly young men and women ready to have families.

Newly-arrived migrants also tend to have higher birth-rates than people in the existing population.

The impact of immigration on childbirth 
was underlined by another rise in the number of babies born to women who
 were themselves born abroad.

Impact: The increase was partly fuelled by a high number of babies born to mothers who were themselves born abroad

The share of babies born to immigrant 
mothers went up again, to 25.9 per cent, well over a quarter of all 
births.

Another factor pushing up birthrates was the growing trend for women of 40 and older to have children.

Numbers of babies born to 40-somethings are now running at five times the level of the mid-1970s and reached almost 30,000 last year.

The leap in 40-plus-year-olds having families is a result of large numbers of women delaying having families because of education, careers, mortgages and their own unstable relationships, and then trying to catch up as they reach the end of their childbearing years.

The figures released by the Office for
 National Statistics show the 724,674 babies were born in England and 
Wales in 2012, 0.8 per cent more than in 2011.

For
 Britain as a whole, the increase was slightly less, a 0.6 per cent rise
 to 812,970. The lesser increase across the United Kingdom was a result 
of falling numbers of births in Scotland.

A
 report by the ONS said there was no single reason for the increase, but
 pointed to a rise in childbirth among women in their late 20s, and 
‘increases in the numbers of foreign-born women who tend to have higher 
fertility than UK-born women’.

It
 also said there is a possibility of ‘Government policy and the economic
 climate indirectly influencing individuals’ decisions around 
childbearing.’

Sir Andrew Green of the Migrationwatch think tank said that the figures showed how immigration is pushing up population and stretching public services.

New data shows there has been a marked increase in the number of births in the paste decade

The number of women in their 40s having babies has increased fivefold since the 1970s

‘If anyone wonders why our maternity wards are under such pressure, this is the answer,’ he said.

‘The official projections show that just over two thirds of our population increase is a result of immigration. Part of this is new arrivals make a contribution to birthrates, as these figures show.’

Numbers of births in England and Wales were last higher than in 2012 in 1971, when 783,155 children were born in England and Wales. At the time birthrates were going down sharply following the peak of the baby boom in 1964.

The lowest number of childbirths in any year since World War Two came in 1977, when there were 569,259 births.

In 2001 there were just under 600,000 children born in England and Wales. Subsequent years have seen birth numbers rising along with immigration that has added three million people to the population.
