The Space Shuttle Independence which resides at the Space Center in Houston, Texas has been hit by vandals overnight.

The graffiti reads 'Houston we are the problem.' The rest of 
the message is said to be highly offensive and racist but has not been released to the media.

Black paint was also sprayed on the replica's mounts. Cleanup crews worked throughout the day to remove the graffiti.

Criminal damage: Vandals have sprayed racial and political graffiti on a full-size replica of the Space Shuttle Independence.
'Houston we are the problem,' was among the writing on the side

The only words that have been repeated
 in the media thus far are, 'Houston, we are the problem.'

.Video of the vandalism has 
been caught on CCTV and police are looking at the footage to try and 
track down the culprits.

The people who did this would have had to climb a short fence to access the shuttle.

The Independence was a consolation prize of sorts for the Johnson Space Center after the space shuttle program was retired.

The three remaining space shuttles were sent to museums in New York, California and at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

Intent: The vadals woudl have had to jump over a fence and use a ladder to jump up onto the shuttles' wings to spray the offensive message

A tour bus operator was among the first to discover the vandalism as he dropped off visitors early Wednesday morning.

'To the person who did this: you really need to check yourself, because you’re making it bad for all other decent people in this town,' said the driver.

'I think probably, to the people, they thought there was a message, but no one else besides them knows, and it’s kind of pointless really,' one visitor told KHOU 11 News.

'To do it with this, it’s kind of off the wall,' said another visitor. 'It’s disgusting.'

What a mess: The graffiti included at least one racial slur along with other offensive messages. Black paint was also sprayed on part of the structure that holds up the replica

Evidence: Cleanup crews and the police have CCTV evidence and should have no trouble tracking down those responsible

The Independence, a mock up that was once on display at Kennedy Space Center and called the Explorer, was sent to Houston after the home of Mission Control was snubbed from getting the real things.

The Independence is scheduled to be mounted on a Boeing 747 shuttle carrier and displayed outside Space Center Houston sometime next year.

Space Shuttle Independence was once a shuttle mockup used to train astronauts.

When the space shuttle program ended, the three orbiters of the shuttle fleet plus the drop test article space shuttle Enterprise, were distributed to sites in Washington, New York, Florida, and Los Angeles.

It stirred up controversy and bitterness in Houston, where the space shuttle astronauts were trained and where shuttle missions were controlled.

The shuttle mockup is considered to be a consolation prize for not getting one of the orbiters that left the planet..
