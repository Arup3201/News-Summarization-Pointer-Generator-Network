An 8-year-old boy was killed in a pre-dawn fire early Monday while his brother, 9, made a daring escape from their burning home by jumping from the second-story bedroom window.

According to police, Jayden Isme was killed at the scene of the townhouse fire, which was so intense firefighters were forced to retreat from the blaze.

His brother Justin Isme ran to a neighbor's house to call 911 after escaping and though he suffered minor injuries will survive.

Father Wisler Toto Isme, pictured her with sons Jayden and Justin, was being interviewed by authorities shortly after the fire

The inferno was so out of control firefighters were unable to enter the residence without risk of being trapped by the collapsing structure

Brother Justin, 9, escaped the house by jumping from the second-floor window

'I saw a little boy who was running, and he must have thought the 
other boy was behind him but he wasn't,' neighborhood resident Sally Williams told The Sun-Sentinel. 'It hurts me, it just hurts.'

Lauderhill Police Department spokesman Lt. Michael Butkus said the boys lived with their mother at the townhome on 2031 NW 59th Way and that their father stayed there on occasion.

'We were able to confirm that the children were left home alone,' Butkus 
said. 'There definitely is a possibility of 
criminal charges, but we're going to wait until the investigation plays 
out.'

He did not release the parent's names.

Neighbors called the brothers an inseparable duo

Neighbor Michael Florent, 31, described the brothers as friendly boys 'heavy into sports.'

'Always together,' he said. 'When you seen one, you seen the other one, always together.'

Justin attempted 'to get the other brother out but was unable to,' Butkus said.

The surviving brother was treated at the Plantation General Hospital.

The cause of the fire remains a mystery.

'There's nothing that I'm seeing or hearing that would indicate there
 was any type of real malicious activity that has gone on,' Butkus said. 'It appears to have been an unfortunate tragedy.'

Authorities have yet to determine the cause of the fire

Jayden's body could not be removed from the townhouse for several hours because of safety concerns.

Florent said his own boy, 8, would often ride bikes with the brothers.Â 

'You shouldn't leave kids alone in the house like that,' he said.
