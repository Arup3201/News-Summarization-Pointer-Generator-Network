Twitter users write the N-word a staggering 500,000 times a day, it has been revealed.

The slur - arguably the most racially charged word in US history - has been posted on the social networking site more than 13 million times in the past month, according to data on Topsy.com.

In contrast, 'bro' and 'dude' - two terms with which n***a is synonymous to many people under the age of 35 - are used only 300,000 and 200,000 times, respectively, on a daily basis.

Over the past 30 days, the former phrase has been posted on Twitter around eight million times, while the latter has been written by users just five-and-a-half million times.

The shocking figures reveal the ingrained and seemingly increasingly prevalent nature of the N-word in today's American youth culture, with many teenagers apparently using the phrase unthinkingly.

Although the slur has long been used in America, it now regularly makes an appearance in college debates, video games, online forums, Christian rap and other elements of popular culture.

'It’s such a regular part of my vernacular. It’s a word I use every day,' actor Tehran Von Ghasri, a D.C. who is both African American and Iranian American, told The Washington Post. 

The 34-year-old added: 'I’m still uncomfortable with [a] white guy saying, "You’re a cool n***a". But in 25 years, I would hope that my kid’s not uncomfortable — because that white guy wouldn’t mean it in a demeaning, degrading way. He would mean it as a positive thing.'

It comes as the National Football League is trying to implement a 'zero tolerance' policy toward players' use of the N-word on the field following a number of high-profile incidents.

Under the regulations,  referees are allowed to issue a 15-yard penalty to players who use the racial slur for a first time and an ejection to those who employ it again.

Racial epithets have become commonplace on Twitter - more common than many less offensive terms

Fewer uses: In contrast to n***a, 'bro' - a term with which n***a is synonymous to many people under the age of 35 - is used only 300,000 times on Twitter per day. Above, the first half of Topsy.com's 'bro' montly data

Figures: 'Dude' - also perceived by many to be a synonymous term for n***a - is tweeted 200,000 times a day

Despite officials' good intentions, not everyone has reacted positively to the policy - with many players and pundits deeming it too heavy-handed, unfair and out of touch. 

Others believe players - the majority of whom are black - will refuse to accept the language directives of predominantly white NFL executives.

In July 2013, Philadelphia Eages wide receiver's Riley Cooper, who is white, was caught on video shouting the N-word word at a country music concert.

Four months later, Miami Dolphins lineman Richie Incognito, who is also white, called his mixed-race teammate, Johnathan Martin, a 'half-n***er' via voicemail. He was later suspended for three months.

And already this season, San Francisco 49ers’ Colin Kaepernick, a mixed-race quarterback - alongside several other players - has been penalized and fined by the NFL for using the slur. 

Originating from the Latin word for black, 'niger', the N-word infiltrated American popular culture in the 1980s and 90s, where it remains a controversial term. 

Many people, including ex-NFL player Donté Stallworth, claim that because today's generation was not directly involved in the civil rights struggle, they do not use the term in a racist manner.

'I’m empathetic to the older generation because they lived it, [but] why are we still attaching ourselves to that word?' said former wide receiver Stallworth.

'Let evolution happen. Let pop culture take that word away to the ocean, and let anyone use it... That word's not meant for us anymore. "N***a" is a part of pop culture. It’s just a word.'

Others believe that the N-word in its '-a' capacity is endearing - as opposed to its alternative '-er' ending, which is supposedly linked to the term's historic, racist origins.

But Dineytra Lee, a Los Angeles dancer of African American and Puerto Rican heritage, argued: 'You change a vowel or two. It doesn’t change the meaning.'

Just days ago, the U.S. Army publicly apologized for saying  'Negro' was an acceptable term to use to describe black personnel.

In October, section 6-2 of the Army's AR 600-20 regulations stated that the phrase could appropriately be used to refer to 'a person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa'.

However, last Saturday, officials apologized for the policy, saying they had limited the acceptable terms to 'Black' or 'African American'. Reports said 'Haitian' had also been deemed okay.

The U.S. Army fully recognized, and promptly acted, to remove outdated language in Army Regulation 600-20 as soon as it was brought to our attention,' a spokesman said.

'We apologize to anyone we offended.'

According to the New York Daily News, 21 per cent of active-duty members of the Army are black.
