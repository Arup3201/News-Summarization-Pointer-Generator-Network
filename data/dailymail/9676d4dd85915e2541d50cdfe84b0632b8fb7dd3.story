An 101-year-old woman who lived through the Russian Revolution, Stalin's Great Purge and Hitler's 872-day seige of Leningrad, died Wednesday after being run over by a police squad car in St. Paul, Minnesota. 

Great-grandmother Roza Sakhina was fatally injured while walking across the middle of the street in front of her apartment in the Highland Park neighborhood of St Paul.

The police officer driving the car was in the neighborhood responding to a juvenile disturbance call. Mrs Sakhina was crossing in the middle of the street in front of her apartment with the aid of a walker when the officer backed up and ran over her.   Police say he was not responding to another call at the time.

Neighbor Sue Chicone's apartment overlooked the intersection and witnessed the scene.

'Her head was gushing, gushing blood,' Chicone told the Star Tribune.

An injured Mrs Sakhina tried to get up, but another elderly woman comforted her and tried to keep her relaxed.

Mrs Sakhina was transported to Regions Hospital, but she never regained consciousness and died Wednesday from her injuries.

So far, St. Paul police have yet to name the officer responsible for running over Mrs Sakhina, but previously said they would release that name Friday.

St Paul police spokesman Paul Paulos said the officer involved was placed on a standard three-day paid adminsitrative leave and that the department is conducting a full investigation.

The Ramsey County medical examiner's office is not releasing the cause of death but according to Mrs Sakhina's grandon Ilya Finkelshteyn, she suffered a skull fracture, rib fracture, internal bleeding and 'quite a bit of bruising'.

He declined to comment on the the role of the officer played in his grandmother's death.

'I'd prefer not to comment, except to say everyone in the family is stricken with grief.'

Mrs Sakhina emigrated to St Paul from St Petersburg, Russia in 1991. In Russia, she worked as an accountant at a chocolate factory and hospital and was also a volunteer nurse.

She passed her citizenship test in the late 1990s, without the aid of a translator. She made the move to the U.S. to join two of her grandchildren who had already previously emigrated.

Finkelshteyn remembers his grandmother as a woman who was able to live an independent and active life even into old age.

'She lived on her own with very minimal help,' he said. She 'walked every day, cooked for herself, read lots.'

'She was very happy to be here, and she loved the state,' he said.

Mrs Sakhina is survived by one son, three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. She is preceded in death by her husband who passed away in 1960 and one son.
