As many as 100,000 foreign students a year are thought to be staying on in Britain illegally after completing academic courses here.

The students – believed to be mostly from the Indian sub-continent – come to Britain to attend universities and colleges, according to official immigration figures.

But the Government’s tracking system has failed to find evidence that they ever left the country.

Missing: Some 177,000 people moved to Britain for long-term study last year, down from 246,000 in 2011. But there is now growing evidence that many of the students who came into the country in recent years never left

The missing thousands have been detected at a time when numbers of student visas and student entrants to the country from outside Europe have been scaled down steeply as part of the Coalition’s drive to reduce immigration to 1990s levels.

Some 177,000 people moved to Britain for long-term study last year, down from 246,000 in 2011.

But there is now growing evidence that many of the students who came into the country in recent years never left.

The MigrationWatch think-tank called on  ministers to set up an inquiry  into what has happened to the missing students and to trace  those still living in the country as illegal immigrants.

Office for National Statistics records show that last year 50,000 people from outside the EU who came to Britain to study returned home, but the numbers leaving fall far short of those arriving as students.

According to the ONS breakdown 145,000 non-EU students came to Britain in 2012; 185,000 in 2011; 186,000 in 2010; and 167,000 in 2009.

Most came from India and other south Asian countries. Numbers of students from China are thought to have grown to be the largest national contingent last year.

Focus: The arrival and departure of students from outside the EU is now under the control of Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured)

The student gap has opened up at a time when the focus of immigration concerns has switched largely to migrants from Europe, and the probability of a new wave of immigration from Romania and Bulgaria – whose citizens won the right to work freely in Britain at the start of the year.

Some of the growing attention to immigration and its effects is now likely to switch to arrivals from outside the EU and the numbers of students, whose arrival and departure is under the control of Home Secretary Theresa May.

Sir Andrew Green of MigrationWatch said: ‘It is very significant  that the number of non-EU students recorded as departing last year  was only 50,000, compared to an average inflow over the last five years of 155,000. 

‘This suggests that students staying on legally or otherwise comprise a major part of net migration.  This issue of the missing students  is one that absolutely must now be tackled. 

‘The education industry is in denial. Whatever the benefits of genuine students, which we all accept, it is absolutely absurd to accept near to 200,000 a year with no effective checks on their departure.’

In The National Audit Office is  to investigate claims that private universities are giving taxpayer-funded loans to thousands of students who don’t go to class.

Students have allegedly been claiming money without proper proof of UK residence following government reforms which allow private college students to claim maintenance loans and grants of up to £11,000 a year.

Colleges can receive £6,000 in tuition fees for each student enrolled.
