Miracle baby: Anna Binks with her long-awaited daughter Esme

This is the miracle baby - born after ten years and ten fertility treatments.

Esme Binks was born five months ago after a lengthy battle which cost her mother Anna a staggering £35,000.

Anna, 34, has undergone ten tries at IVF treatment in the last decade - but says it has finally been worth it to have her miracle daughter.

Anna, who works for Macmillan cancer support, and lives in Hull with husband Phil, 40, a fireman, said: ‘It has been an incredible emotional battle to have Esme and there were plenty of times when I thought I would never be a mum.

‘She has cost a lot of money, but she has been worth every penny. She’s our miracle daughter.’

Anna’s battle began back in 2002, when she began trying for a baby with her former partner.

She said: ‘He had some fertility problems and then I also found out that I had blocked fallopian tubes too, so I knew that we needed to have treatment.’

Anna had a first IVF attempt at a fertility clinic in Hull, but it didn’t work.

She then underwent a course of artificial insemination, but again that did not work.

She said: ‘I had been so hopeful the first time that it would work, and when it didn’t, it was devastating. Then when the second attempt failed too, it was heartbreaking. But I was determined to carry on. I wanted to have a baby more than anything in the world.’

She then had a further five attempts from November 2005 until April 2007. But she failed to fall pregnant.

She said: ‘The doctors couldn’t understand what was going wrong. My embryos were always top quality yet nothing was happening. They eventually advised me to consider adoption as they didn’t think it was going to happen for me.’

Anna then went to CARE Fertility in Nottingham for help. She had another course of fertility treatment - her eighth - but it also failed.

She said: ‘They had given me hope and told me not to give up, but it was still devastating to fail again. I’d had eight fertility treatments by now, and nothing. I thought I would never be a mum, but something inside me wouldn’t give up.

'I tried everything - supplements, acupuncture, and I read somewhere that wearing orange knickers encouraged fertility so I did that too. I was so desperate to try anything that may help.’

She had her ninth course of fertility treatment in July 2008 and fell pregnant, but devastatingly she miscarried the baby at 11 weeks.

She said: ‘That was the lowest point. After all these years of trying, I had finally fallen pregnant, only to lose my baby. It was heartbreaking.’

Anna split with her partner and met her husband Phil 12 months later. They married in June 2011 and decided to have one last try at IVF. She had funded her previous attempts by selling her house and taking out loans.

She said: ‘It was going to be my last attempt. We’d had some money for our wedding, so we decided to use that. I’d been trying for so long and had been through so many treatments. If this didn’t work, I had to finally accept that my battle was over and I was never going to be a mum.’

In April last year  Anna had her tenth course of treatment at CARE Fertility, and two weeks later she discovered she was pregnant.

She said: ‘I was thrilled, but I was worried in case I lost this baby too. All the way through the pregnancy right up until I gave birth, I was still petrified that I was going to lose her.’

Esme arrived into the world at Hull and East Yorkshire Hospital in January weighing a healthy 7Ib11.

She said: ‘It was the most amazing moment of my life when she was born and I held her in my arms for the first time. After ten years, ten fertility treatments and £35,000 I finally had my miracle daughter.

Lucky: 'I would love to try for a brother or sister for Esme,' Anna said, 'but I would definitely have to win the lottery first!'

‘I just couldn’t stop crying, I couldn’t believe she was finally here. Phil was really emotional too.’Esme is now five months old and has a healthy appetite and loves a hearty sunday dinner.

Anna added: ‘She is absolutely perfect and every day I look at her and think how lucky I am. I would love to try for a brother or sister for Esme, but I would definitely have to win the lottery first!’

Dr Phillip Lowe, from CARE Fertility, said: 'I see many couples with complex fertility problems – but Anna and Phil have the biggest set of case notes I’ve ever seen! It is extremely unusual to wait ten years to become pregnant. We were absolutely delighted to hear that Esme had arrived safe and sound after all this time.'
