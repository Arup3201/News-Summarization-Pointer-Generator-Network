Two police officers have been injured after they were attacked by a man wielding a knife.

They were taken to hospital following the alleged assault while answering a call last night about a row between neighbours in Old Trafford, Manchester.

One of the officers is being treated for injuries to his head while the other was hurt on the shoulder when a man lunged at him with a blade inside the terraced house.

The officers bravely managed to arrest the suspect despite being attacked and back-up was called in. Neither of the men have suffered life-threatening injuries.

Neighbours living nearby reported seeing armed police and ambulances arriving at the scene a short while after the incident happened at 8.15pm last night.

Detective Inspector Myra Ball said: 
'Thankfully neither officer appears to be seriously injured, but this 
demonstrates the daily dangers faced by our officers when responding to 
incidents.

'Officers managed to take control of the situation, despite the injuries suffered, and quickly made an arrest.'

The officers had been speaking to a witness to the argument between neighbours when the man attacked.

The suspect remains in custody where he is being questioned.
