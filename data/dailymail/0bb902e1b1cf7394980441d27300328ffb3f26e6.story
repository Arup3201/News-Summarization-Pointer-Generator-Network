Nigella Lawson moved out of the marital home she shared with Charles Saatchi more than a year before their much publicised break-up, it emerged yesterday in court.

Rather than living in the palatial family home near King’s Road in Chelsea, she moved south of the Thames to a property she owned in Battersea, a three-storey £1.4million residence.

She resided there with one of the women now on trial for stealing from her.

Split: Nigella Lawson moved out of the marital 
home she shared with Charles Saatchi more than year before their much 
publicised break-up, the court heard yesterday

It was only in June this year that Mr Saatchi was famously pictured grabbing his wife’s neck outside a restaurant.

After
 he claimed it was just a ‘playful tiff’, she left home for good. He 
accepted a caution for assault, and divorce followed promptly.

But
 when Mr Saatchi’s art gallery finance director Rahul Gajjar was 
yesterday being questioned over the alleged £685,000 fraud by the 
couple’s former assistants Francesca and Lisa Grillo, it emerged that 
the marriage may have been troubled long before it ended.

Mr
 Gajjar had told the court that when the Italian sisters were accused of
 spending massively to their own benefit on family credit cards, they 
were given the option of both living rent-free while trying to pay back 
their allegedly ill-gotten gains.

The accountant said that Francesca was
 in fact already living rent-free in a property owned by Miss Lawson in 
Battersea, and Lisa was given the option of joining her.

Mr Gajjar then revealed that in fact 
at that point, in July last year, Miss Lawson was already living in the 
Battersea house after leaving the home she shared with Mr Saatchi. Mr 
Gajjar said: ‘At some point she moved out of the residence.’

He did not explain why Miss Lawson had left the family home, nor for how long.

But he said that although the 
Battersea home – which is opposite a townhouse owned by the Speaker of 
the House of Commons John Bercow and his wife Sally – was Miss Lawson’s,
 Mr Saatchi paid the council tax as well as the water, gas and 
electricity bills.

Revelation: It emerged in court that

Lisa Grillo ultimately turned down the
 option of moving in with her sister and Miss Lawson in Battersea, and 
as the dispute with the celebrity couple turned into a criminal 
prosecution, Francesca moved out of the property.The Grillo sisters are now living together in a property in central London.

Miss Lawson meanwhile evidently moved 
back into the family home with Mr Saatchi – although the house is so 
enormous that she and Mr Saatchi had large separate offices and rooms, 
with their three children also having their own kitchenettes.

Miss Lawson finally left for good in 
June this year after the furore over the shocking photographs of her 
husband ‘throttling’ her broke out.

She now lives with her two teenage children in a mews house in central London.
