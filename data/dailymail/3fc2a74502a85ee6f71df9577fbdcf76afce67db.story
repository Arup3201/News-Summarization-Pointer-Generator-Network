This is the shocking moment a police officer shot a dog dead because it wouldn't stop barking.Â 

Officer Tarek Hassani, of the Filer Police Department in Idaho, was filmed firing his gun at point blank range after being called to the scene of a nine-year-old's birthday party where dogs were said to be wandering in the street.

The clip, filmed on the police patrol car's dashboard recorder, outraged the seven-year-old Labrador's owner who accused the officer of being 'trigger happy', but incredibly the local police force will take no action as they say the officer was left with 'no choice' but to kill the 'aggressive' dog.

Death: After being shot at point blank range, the dog is seen twitching on the floor and yelping in agony, before shuffling out of shot and dying

Beloved: Mr Clubb's labrador was called Hooch

The incident took place at around 5.30pm on Saturday after officers were called to reports of number of dogs escaping from a home in the town of Filer during a child's birthday party.

One of the dogs in question was a seven-year-old black Labrador named Hooch, who acted as a service dog for Parkinson's disease sufferer Rick Clubb.

It was Mr Clubb's son who was celebrating his ninth birthday at the time.

Within seconds of arriving at the scene, the police officer was greeted by the barking Labrador, a Chihuahua and another unidentified dog, although none appeared to be displaying a particularly high level of aggression until Officer Hassani began shouting 'get back' and kicked one of them.

When the dogs began snarling and barking in a more threatening way, Officer Hassani was seen pulling out his gun and shooting the Labrador at point blank range.

The dog is then seen twitching on the floor and yelping in agony, before shuffling out of shot and dying.

The shooting subsequently led to a heated exchange between Officer Hassani and Mr Clubb, who was not just unhappy that his dog was dead, but also that the killing took place directly outside his son's bedroom window.

Mr Clubb was later given a fine for allowing his dogs to run loose in the neighbourhood.

Revealing that Officer Hassani would not be facing any punishment over the incident, Filer Police Chief Tim Reeves said: 'He had to kick one to keep him away... Hassani had no choice but to put the Lab down after it kept taking an aggressive posture behind him.'
