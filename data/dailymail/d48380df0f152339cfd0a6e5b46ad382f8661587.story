Jeopardy! champ Arthur Chu, who won big money while taking heat for his renegade style, has been defeated.

Chu
 finished in third place with zero dollars on Wednesday's edition of the
 syndicated quiz show. He had reigned for 12 days. His total winnings 
were $297,200.

'A great run,' summed up host Alex Trebek.

Evil genius: Arthur Chu's reign over Jeopardy has come to an end after 11 straight victories on the long-running quiz show

Champ: Diana Peloquin the woman who unseated Chu, who angered Jeopardy purists with his unconventional game strategy

Chu was unseated by Diana Peloquin of Ann Arbor, Mich., who led for the day with $15,700.

Chu
 had struggled for much of the show when, in Final Jeopardy, he risked, 
and lost, his entire day's bankroll - $6,400 - on the question: 'He was 
the last male monarch who had not previously been Prince of Wales.'

Only Peloquin had the correct response: George VI.

The
 30-year-old Chu, a resident of Broadview Heights, Ohio, has described 
himself on Twitter as 'mad genius, comedian, actor and freelance 
voiceover artist.'

He 
applied a 'mad genius' approach to Jeopardy! brinkmanship. He ditched 
the time-honored practice of polishing off each category's questions one
 by one. Instead, he took a hopscotch approach to his category choices, 
which tended to keep his opponents off-kilter.

Defence: Mr Chu spoke out against outraged Twitter users, admitting he values $10,000 more anyway

A little bit different: Arthur Chu, 30, (right) Jeopardy's latest and greatest star, has used Jeopardy game theory to become nightly must-see TV. But his unorthodox methods have made him a polarizing figure

Nice gift: Arthur Chu celebrated turning 30 with the announcement of his third Jeopardy win his accumulated winnings going up to $80,000

He
 also concluded that the bottom rows of the game board are most likely 
to contain the hidden Daily Doubles, and he played accordingly.

Chu's
 strategy fueled indignation from Jeopardy! traditionalists, who 
contended that such an aggressive style was somehow unsportsmanlike and 
exhibited a lack of respect for the game.

Chu
 'rejected the unwritten rule that the guy or gal with the most facts 
wins,' said On the Media host Brooke Gladstone on an episode of the 
public radio show last month, 'and replaced it with the appalling idea 
that you can outwit your opponent with the wily application of game 
theory.'

It was a style 
much different from that of legendary know-it-all Ken Jennings, who a 
decade ago set a Jeopardy! record with 74 consecutive victories while 
winning $2.5 million.

Knowing his weakness: In his second game, Arthur Chu he immediately admitted that he knew very little about sports, and wagered only $5

Chu, a 30-year-old Ohio insurance 
compliance analyst, who does freelance voiceovers, spent a month 
studying the quiz where people guess the questions to answers that pop 
up on the screen.

When
 he first appeared on the show earlier this year, he baffled opponents 
by picking squares at random and betting strange amounts on his answers,
 rather than moving down the board in a straight line.

Arthur
 calls the strategy, which aims to disarm his opponents, Forrest Bounce,
 after successful 1980s player Chuck Forrest who also 'bounced' around 
the board.

His controversial strategy helped him win 12 times in a row.

The strategy sparked outrage across social media, as viewers accused Mr Chu of 'unsportsmanship'.

But Mr Chu dismissed the furor, telling Fox News: 'Like any game, strategy plays a big role.'

Arrgh: Arthur's game-play tactics appear to delight and frustrate viewers in equal measure

Tactics: Part of Chu's strategy is to pick the highest value questions first where more of the Daily Double questions are hidden

He
 added: 'I can't change your impression of me but, again, we're playing 
for money. Between $10,000 and getting haters on Twitter, $10,000 is 
more important to me.'

The 
so-called 'evil genius', as dubbed by angry Twitter users, has also 
received support from the show's host Megyn Kelly, who said Arthur 
'seems to get' the concept of winning.

In the game, three contestants stand behind lecterns with a buzzer, a screen and a light pen.

They
 are presented with answers to questions on a range of topics - history,
 science, arts, popular culture, literature, and languages - and must 
guess what was asked to reach them.

Each
 category has five clues, ranked in order of difficulty. For every 
correct answer, the player wins the value of the square - the easiest is
 $200, the hardest is $1,000.

Playing to win: Chu went out of his way and jumped around the board to find as many Daily Doubles as possible

There
 are also 'Daily Doubles', where a contestant can stake as much money as
 they want on a pot luck question in the hope of doubling it.

Arthur is quick and confident with his answers, darting from a $1,000 question to $200 for seemingly no reason.

But he has received a mixed reception from viewers with some sites such as Philly.com are calling him a 'hero', whilst others blogs like BarStool describe him as a 'mad genius'.

Before appearing on the show, Arthur claims he studied the mechanics of the gameshow that has been running for 30 years.

Love him or hate him? Some of the shows' fans admire Arthur ChuÂ¿s game strategy

'I
 decided pretty early on, you know, I'm not going to be able to learn 
all the things I don't know in terms of actual knowledge,' he says.

'You
 only get a month between when they call you and when you have to go out
 for the show. So I said, 'What's the strategy that'll serve me best on 
the show?' It seems that people don't actually think about the strategy 
of the game itself as much as they do about the knowledge.'

'I
 quickly found stories about former champions like Roger Craig and David
 Madden and Chuck Forrest who've bucked the tradition of starting at the
 top of each category and slowly going down and achieved great success 
in the game.'

'There's no 
logical reason to do that -- if you are able to take your opponents by 
surprise and keep them guessing and on their toes about what the next 
clue is going to be, you gain a major advantage over them. One of the 
few parts of the game you actually have any control over is your power 
to select the next question after answering a question correctly,' he 
told MailOnline.

Arthur has been tweeting his performance each night on his Twitter account @arthur_effect and through Facebook.

Interesting play: Wednesday's game was a wild one, where Arthur Chu went down to zero during Double Jeopardy after missing a Daily Double, only to surge back into the lead before the ultimate wager

Generous: Chu's most interesting move so far was on Wednesday's show, when he entered Final Jeopardy in the lead and intentionally wagered so that he might tie with another player, Carolyn Collins
