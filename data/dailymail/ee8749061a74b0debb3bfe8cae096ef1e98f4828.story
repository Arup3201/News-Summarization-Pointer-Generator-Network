A crime victim has been waiting four years for compensation from a crook who told police his name was Jesus H Christ.

Estate agent Mark Lewis was promised £75 after the villain was convicted of smashing two windows of a house he was selling in St Austell, Cornwall.

The homeless vandal told police he was called Jesus H Christ - and the same name was recorded in court documents when appeared before magistrates in February 2010.

JPs awarded Mr Lewis damages but he is still waiting - while continuing to get court correspondence listing the debtor as the Son of God.

Mark said: 'Because of our British justice system the man has the right to be called Jesus H Christ if he wants to.

'He was prosecuted and fined and afterwards he walked out of court and wandered off.

'I'm still waiting for my £75 from Mr Christ.'
