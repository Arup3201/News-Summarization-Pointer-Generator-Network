An increasing number of millionaires long to leave the UK, citing warm weather as the main attraction of foreign shores.

Nearly a quarter of Britons worth Â£1million or more are considering leaving the country in the next two years, a survey by Lloyds TSB International found.

Nearly two thirds said the British climate was the main reason why they wished to emigrate, whilst only 41 per cent mentioned taxes.

For the climate: More millionaires want to leave the UK - and apparently it is warmer weather they are looking for

The proportion of millionaires ready to pack their bags, 22 per cent, is an increase by three per cent on last year's result.

Half of millionaires were concerned about crime and 45 per cent said the cost of living was too high for them to remain in the country.

But concerns about tax have subsided, with a four per cent drop since March this year.

Of the countries the wealthy would like to move to, France topped the list, followed by Spain, the US, Australia and New Zealand.

However, 64 per cent of the wealthy Britons said they were happy living in the UK.

Better infrastructure topped the list of things British millionaires said would make the UK a more attractive place to live.

Improving public services and cutting red tape for businesses were next on the wish list, followed by tax cuts.

Lloyds TSB international director Richard Musty said: 'Wealthy Britons are increasingly considering emigrating, not necessarily for financial reasons, but because they feel their quality of life may be better elsewhere.

'We are seeing this in our client base too, with France, Spain and America increasingly popular locations to settle in.

'This could be part of a wider trend towards globalisation and a more outward-looking way of life for many rich people.'
