Viewers of BBC Breakfast got a rather rude awakening yesterday after a foul-mouthed comment was broadcast by mistake.

BBC One’s morning show took on a 
distinctly post-watershed air when business reporter Steph McGovern 
turned the air blue – not realising her microphone was switched on.

During an item about musicals, host Susanna Reid welcomed conductor John
Wilson to the studio, showing a clip of his orchestra before wishing 
him a ‘good beautiful morning’.

But 1.5million viewers also heard a 
disembodied voice exclaiming: ‘What the **** is that?’

It is thought that Miss McGovern’s microphone had accidentally been left on after her earlier appearance on screen. The presenters carried on interviewing Mr Wilson.

But Susanna later apologised for the 'unfortunate' language and blamed a microphone not being turned off for the blunder.

She said: 'Now a little earlier on in the programme we realise that there was a technical error and a microphone may have been open and unfortunate language may have been broadcast in the programme.

'If you heard that this morning we do make an apology for that. Unfortunately people who presume that their microphone is closed may talk a little bit more freely than they should.

'So apologies if you were offended by that and we are just going to look into correcting that technical problem and make sure that it doesn’t happen again.'

The foul-mouthed outburst became a popular talking point online as users sent messages about the slip on Twitter.

The BBC said a microphone had been left on outside the studio which picked up the four-letter word.

A spokeswoman said: 'During the programme this morning, we accidentally played out not-for-broadcast audio containing an audible swear word. The error was caused by a radio microphone inadvertently being left on outside our studio.

'Our presenters apologised on air as soon as the mistake was identified and we are reviewing our procedures accordingly.'

The show has previously had to apologise for broadcasting swear words when an uncensored tape of actor Christian Bale letting fly with a torrent of abuse was mistakenly aired.

Dame Helen Mirren and film director Nicolas Winding Refn have also used bad language on the programme.
