An Oregon man accused of killing his girlfriend while they were on a hike six years ago tried but failed to collect on her $1 million life insurance policy, it has been revealed.

Stephen Wagner Nichols, 40, of Bend, was arrested this month at San Francisco International Airport after Oregon authorities alerted California officers that he would be arriving on a flight from China.

He had been secretly indicted in April on a murder charge in the death of 23-year-old Rhonda Casto, which had previously been thought an accident, when she fell 100 feet on a steep, narrow path in March 2009.

Heartbreaking: Family members say Rhonda Casto, 23, left behind a young daughter, and confirmed that she was dating Stephen Nichols, now aged 40, at the time of her death

He did not appear to have been a suspect in the death of his nine-years-younger girlfriend death when her lifeless body was found on March 16, 2009.

Investigators have not revealed if they believe Nichols pushed her or how she may have fallen about a mile from a trailhead in the Columbia River Gorge, 45 miles east of Portland.

Court documents show Nichols and Casto became romantically involved in 2005 and had a daughter, who is now six, according to The Oregonian

It was not clear who has custody of the girl.

The papers reveal that the couple each bought a $1million life insurance policy in late 2008 from MetLife and named each other as beneficiaries, records show.

Their daughter was named as contingent beneficiary.

Nichols sued MetLife after it denied his $1million claim. The company said the insurance policy was void because of omissions on the application.

MetLife asserted in a counterclaim that "it is unclear whether plaintiff/counterclaim defendant Steven Wagner Nichols was involved in the murder of Rhonda Casto," according to a June 2011 opinion written by U.S. District Judge Ancer Haggerty.

If he was, the company said, he may not be entitled to the money under Oregon law.

Consequences: If convicted, Nichols could face 25 years to life in prison for Casto's (pictured) murder 

In October, Haggerty ruled that the $1million be put in an interest-bearing account under the court's control. MetLife's attorneys agreed that if Nichols was not entitled to the money, it would be given to the couple's daughter.

Casto's mother, Julia Anne Simmons, filed a wrongful-death suit against Nichols that Haggerty dismissed.

It was later moved to Multnomah County Circuit Court and put on hold in December because the case is "under review by the Hood River County prosecutor's office," according to court documents.

Nichols is being held without bail in an Oregon jail, and he is scheduled to appear in court March 3.

The case has similarities to one in Colorado, where a man was charged with pushing his wife 140 feet from a cliff in Rocky Mountain National Park, where they were hiking in 2012 to celebrate their anniversary.

Harold Henthorn, 58, stood to benefit from three life insurance policies totaling $4.5 million, court documents said.

Ms Simons told FOX 12 at the time of Casto’s death: 'I think about her last moments, and what she was thinking when she fell.

Narrow: At the time, Casto's death was ruled accidental. It was then believed that she slipped of the trail. Pictures of the Eagle Creek Trail show how narrow it becomes at points 

'How she's not going to get to see her daughter take her first steps. And how I'm never going to get to see my daughter again.'

Not many details were released about Casto's death at the time, other than that a 'male companion' (now identified as Nichols), called 911 around 6pm to say she had fallen off a ledge while they were hiking the Eagle Creek Trail

The popular hiking destination has been the scene of other accidents in the past, due to a few narrow sections that drop off on one side into a ravine.

The trail was even more dangerous that day due to a battering of sleet and hail that made the trail slippery.

Casto was one of four hikers who either fell to their death or died of exposure on Columbia River Gorge trails like Eagle Creek that year.

'The trail is very steep and narrow there, and it's been pretty wet and slippery,' Hood River County sheriff's Deputy Matt English told The Oregonian in 2009. 'There was still snow on the ground down near the parking lot.'

It's currently unclear why Casto's case was reopened and the cause of death switched to homicide.

Nichols is currently being held without bail and his next court appearance is scheduled for March 3 at 11am.
