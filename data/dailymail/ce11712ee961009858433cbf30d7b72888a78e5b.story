A 37-year-old man allegedly beat his mother's boyfriend with brass knuckles before shooting him in the stomach for having mixed-race grandchildren.

Craig Wilson, 45, was allegedly attacked by Jeff Daniels at a rural Mississippi home on Friday night, two weeks after the older man found a burning cross in his yard - a hallmark Ku Klux Klan intimidation technique. Police went to see the cross but he did not want to press charges.

Relatives said that the fight unfolded on Friday because Daniels was angry that Wilson's mixed-race grandchildren were at the home.

Yet because the suspect and victim - who survived the attack but remains hospitalized - are both white, police said the assault can't be classified a hate crime under Mississippi state law.

Innocent: Relatives said Jeffrey Daniels was furious that Craig Wilson invited his daughter's mixed-race children (pictured) to stay at his Mississippi home

'That's the way I read the law,' Smith County Sheriff Charlie Crumpton told The Clarion-Ledger. 'I told my assistant district attorney that the law is very clear that the victim has to be a different race in order for it to be a hate crime.'

Wilson has undergone surgery for the gunshot wound to his intestines and has since been 
upgraded from a critical to fair condition at the University of 
Mississippi Medical Center.

The sheriff could not say if the attack and the burning cross were connected, but Daniels has denied being involved in the cross incident.

'I didn't know nothing about no cross,' Daniels, who spent three nights in jail for a charge of aggravated assault, told the Clarion-Ledger at his home in Raleigh on Tuesday.

He insisted he was walking his dogs two miles away from their house at the time.

But his mother Gaylene Daniels, who has been in a relationship with Wilson for 12 years, told the Carion Ledger that she saw her son's dog, Jack Daniels, as she opened the door and saw the burning cross.

She added that she had heard of his anger about the children but never told her about it personally.

When she confronted him about it, it caused a row but she stopped it, worried that he would return and hurt them, she said. Just days later, the violent argument erupted in the home.

Threat? Relatives said two weeks before Daniels allegedly assaulted Wilson, someone left a burning cross at the front of Wilson's home - a hallmark Ku Klux Klan intimidation technique

Wilson's relatives told WTOC the violence erupted about 8pm Friday when Daniels and his son stormed Wilson's home shouting racist slurs.

They said Daniels was angry Wilson was letting his mixed-raced grandchildren sleep over; Wilson's daughter, Whitney Wilson, is white and has children with a black man.

The
 men allegedly got into a heated argument before Daniels beat Wilson 
with brass knuckles and a stick, and when Wilson went to grab his gun, Daniels grabbed it and shot him.

Gaylene Daniels said her son then came up and grabbed her and said: 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry.'

But speaking to the Clarion Ledger, Daniels claimed that the fight took place after he heard his daughter was at the home 
and he went there to see her.

As he 
arrived at the home, Wilson approached him with a gun, he said, and a 
scuffle on the ground ensued. He said Wilson punched him six times so he
 could get the gun off him and shoot.

Julie Wilson, the victim's sister, considers the attack a hate crime.

'They called him some severe names and then they told him to leave and they chased him off his porch around his house and beat him with brass knuckles and shot him with his own gun,' she told WTOC.

Julie Wilson also said the threats to keep the mixed-race grandchildren away have been ongoing.

'He (Daniels) told everybody that he would die for his children and to him the grandchildren are like his and he almost paid the price this weekend,' she said.

WDAM reported Daniels had been arrested for assault several times before.

According to the Rankin County Sheriff, Daniels was arrested in January for encouraging is son to fight other teens.

Daniels was charged with two misdemeanor counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and convicted of one.
