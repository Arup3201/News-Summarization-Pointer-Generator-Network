Matt Prior says the England dressing room will be a better place without Kevin Pietersen.

Prior was instrumental in Pietersen returning to the England frame after the Andrew Strauss text scandal but their relationship deteriorated towards the end of the ill-fated Ashes tour.

The wicketkeeper is now firmly behind the decision to sack the maverick despite adding that his erstwhile team-mate had the ability to make him 'the best England cricketer to ever walk this planet'.

'I think one of the biggest things the ECB want to rediscover is the value of playing cricket for England, the honour and the pride you need to show as an England cricketer,' said Prior at an event in Dubai.

'And they only want people in that dressing room who are going to be passionate about England winning and performing.'

When then asked whether that dressing room will be a better place without Pietersen, Prior said 'Yes, it will.'

The wicketkeeper then turned his thoughts to captain Alastair Cook, saying that he needs to become nastier to be a better leader.

'I think being such a nice person is one of the things which doesn't stand him in good stead as a captain and the best thing about him is he accepts that and he knows he has to improve.

'When it comes to captaincy he's a big enough bloke to admit he's not the finished article yet.

'To read some of the criticism he's got has just been incredible, as anyone who knows him respects him.

'He will score the most runs for an Englishman in Test cricket, no doubt, and he's a phenomenal bloke as well.'
