Manchester United will not attempt to cash in on any of their first four blank Champions League weeks following discussions between manager Louis van Gaal and executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward.

Van Gaal has asked for and received a 10-week amnesty in which he can train with his players without the distractions of money-spinning friendlies to make up the financial shortfall caused by Manchester United’s failure to qualify for Europe.

After that the 62-year-old Dutchman has agreed to sit down with Woodward again to assess the situation.

Amnesty: Louis van Gaal has been promised 10 weeks with his players to train them up to his tactics

Demands: Van Gaal (right) wants time to get his squad to adapt to his tactical ideas across to his squad

The Dutchman said: ‘I need preparation of 10 weeks and I am lucky Manchester United are not playing in a European competition to do this,’ he said.

‘We have discussed the issue of friendly matches and for the first 10 weeks, we have to train. After that it is different and we will wait to see if we have a chance to play some matches.

‘It will also depends on the opponent. It has to be a good opponent like this tournament in America.’

The compromise with Woodward has been reached after van Gaal complained that United’s current 13,500-mile pre-season tour of America had hampered his plans.

To stress his displeasure, he said: ‘Manchester United shall do everything to adapt to my rules for good preparation.’

The Dutchman has spent his first fortnight in the USA working on tactical issues with his players and will do the bulk of the fitness work when they return to England this week.

Money: United will miss out on playing lucrative friendlies until at least December at Van Gaal's request

But he has now won a guarantee from Woodward that the club will not seek friendly games, in which they could earn several million pounds per game, when other clubs are playing Champions League fixtures in September, October and early-November.

However, it does raise the prospect of United jetting abroad in December when the final group games are played in the Champions League or when the competition returns at the knockout stage in the spring, possibly against other leading clubs who are out of Europe.

Van Gaal believes the tactical understanding his players have in his methods is the key to whether United can reclaim a top-four place after finishing seventh last season.

‘You cannot compare players under the guidance of Moyes with those same players under the guidance of Louis van Gaal,’ he said.

‘Every trainer and coach and manager wants a different style of play and different tactics, so it is impossible to compare. I have to see for myself what those players are capable of before I can make any judgement - and two weeks is too short to say.’

Victory: United beat Real Madrid 3-1 in America as they continued their 100% record under Van Gaal

Rivals: United will face Liverpool in Miami on Sunday in the final of the Guinness International Champions Cup
