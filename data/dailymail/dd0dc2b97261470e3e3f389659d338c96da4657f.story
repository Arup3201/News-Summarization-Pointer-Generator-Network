There is overcrowding - and there is overcrowding Chinese style.

Traffic police in Luoyang city in Henan Province did a double-take when they saw six men sharing an electric bike on the road.

A picture of the packed bike shows that three of the men were standing on the back, two were seated and one was clinging precariously to the front of the vehicle.

Heavy load: Six men balance on a bike in Luoyang city in Henan Province, China. Traffic police did a double-take when they saw the men on the road. They were allegedly en-route to a card game when they were pulled over

Local police spokesman Shaiming Chao said: 'The officers couldn't believe it. In China people transport many items on bikes - boxes, suitcases, cartons, even goats and sheep - but we've never witnessed so many adult males on one machine.'

The men were allegedly on their way to a card game when they were pulled over.

Officer Chao went on: 'They all thought that it was no big deal - but they had at least ten more kilometres to go when they were stopped.

'Officers issued a citation for dangerous operation of a transport vehicle and made four men get off and walk while the driver and one passenger were allowed to continue on their way.'

Lo Meng, one of the passengers forced to walk into town after the incident said: 'We have done this loads of times and police never batted an eyelid before.

'I saw one guy ride down the road only the other day with a fridge-freezer strapped to his back.

'If we got into an accident at least we could look after ourselves and avoid others.Â  I think the fridge-freezer would be far more deadly than us.'
