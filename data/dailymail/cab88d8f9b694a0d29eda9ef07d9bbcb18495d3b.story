It's an age-old problem that's had present-wrappers fighting a ridiculous battle with sellotape

But now millions all over the world can rejoice as a new design not only eliminates finding the end of the sellotape, but also the direction to unpeel.

The 'Transparent Tape' is the work of Chinese designers at Nanoin Design who wanted to create a simple solution to this sticky problem.

The Transparent Tape has non-adhesive edges, so it is easy to find the end of the roll. Not only does the design save stress, but a quarter of the adhesive that is typically used can be saved

The tape works by having non-adhesive edges so that its easy to find the end of the roll by running a finger around it.

Black lines show exactly where the glue-free perimeter is located, making it easy to identify the edges.

The design hopes to do away with the need to scratch at the end of the roll while trying to lift it, which damages the tape.

The Transparent Tape won the Red Dot Design Award 2013 for designers Gao Fenglin, Huang Xiaofei, Zhou Buyi. The team are now looking for a production partner

It could also prevent people being covered in cuts of sellotape in an attempt to pre-empt losing the roll's end.

The Chinese agency is behind a number of other innovative designs, including a mug that can be stored at an angle.

The Bevel Cup, inspired by the angular stance of a ballerina, aims to make cup storage more hygenic by making sure the rim doesn't touch any surface.
