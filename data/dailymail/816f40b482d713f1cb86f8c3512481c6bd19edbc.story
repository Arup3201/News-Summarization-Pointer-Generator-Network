Fulham manager Felix Magath says he might not even bother watching Sunday's World Cup final between Germany and Argentina since he sees the outcome as a foregone conclusion in favour of his compatriots.

Germany head into the final at the Maracana as favourites after demolishing hosts Brazil 7-1 in the semi-finals, and former West Germany international Magath expects the final to be another one-sided encounter.

'I don't know if I will watch it,' Magath told Germany's ZDF television. 'For me, the result is obvious. I think it will be 3-0 to Germany.'

He is not the only one who expects Joachim Low's men to cruise to victory on Sunday.

'I'm absolutely convinced that we will beat Argentina,' said Harald Schumacher, goalkeeper of the Germany side which finished second at the 1982 and 1986 World Cups.
