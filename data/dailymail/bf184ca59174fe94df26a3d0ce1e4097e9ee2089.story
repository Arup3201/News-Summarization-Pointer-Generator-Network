For years council gardeners working on a smart suburban road have carefully trimmed back the grass verges during the summer months.

But this year the authority have sent their workers out and told them to trim only one side of the street - and ignore the other because it is 'not their job any more'.

In a baffling move designed to save money, two 
local authorities in Carlton, Nottinghamshire, now have to send two separate gardeners to look after the same road.

Council cutbacks: Bill Fenton, 65, said that while the authority has cut the grass on one side of this street in Carlton, Nottinghamshire, the other has been allowed to grow to 15 inches - because 'another authority is responsible'

Edge of a council boundary: While Gedling Borough Council look after the far side of the road, the near side is classed as a 'public highway' so it is Nottinghamshire County Council's job to cut it

So while homeowners on one side have seen the unkempt grass grow to 15 inches, on the other it has been mowed four 
times this year already and looks ‘like a billiards table’.

Gedling Borough Council insist it is no longer their responsibility to keep the whole of Shelford Road looking smart - and blamed the decision on 'government cutbacks'.

They trim the verges 14 times a year between March and October.

Anger: Bill Fenton, 65, and his wife Sylvia, 66, who returned from six months away to find the grass overgrown

In comparison, Nottinghamshire County Council which has been handed the job of cutting the other side of the road, does the job only five times between April and November.

It was thought that taking the job off Gedling Borough Council would help save taxpayers' money.

Pensioners Bill and Sylvia Fenton 
returned to Britain after six months away to find a 75-square metre 
patch of grass outside their home was completely overgrown.

Grandfather-of-two Bill, 65, said the situation has left their neighbourhood looking like an eyesore.

'Both sides were mowed in January but the changes must have occurred at 
the start of the financial year,' he said.

'It hasn’t been cut since January now and has grown to 15 inches. The other side has probably been cut four times since January.

'It’s a small job that wouldn’t take 
much effort, so I don’t know why they can’t just talk to each other and 
arrange Gedling to do this extra patch.

'We all understand there’s austerity measures but to send two teams to do the same job on different days is ridiculous.

'It is a laughable situation. My grandson walked into it the other day and I nearly lost him.

'It feels like it’s not on the council’s list of things to do. We just don’t feel like we’re getting the service we pay for.

'One side looks like a billiard table and the other is a right eyesore. It’s ridiculous.'

Cut price service: The move to have two authority's cutting two sides of the same road was made to 'save money'

Overgrown: Nottinghamshire County Council insist they will be cutting the 15-inch grass imminently

A spokesman for Gedling Borough Council said: 'Both sides used of Shelford Road used to be our responsibility but when the Government cutbacks came in 2010, we stopped.

'One side is classed as a green space - which is our responsibility - but the other is a public highway, which is Nottinghamshire County Council's. So technically its not on our land.'

Dave Walker, Nottinghamshire County Council’s district highways manager for Gedling, said there had been a delay in cutting their grass areas.

He said: 'The county council is responsible for cutting more than 5,000kilometres of grass verge right across the county.

'There was a delay starting this year due to bad weather which, unfortunately, also helps the grass to grow that bit quicker.

'We are just coming to the end of the first cut so all areas, including Shelford Road, should have been cut by now.'

Both councils said the grass is cut purely for safety, rather than aesthetic, reasons.
