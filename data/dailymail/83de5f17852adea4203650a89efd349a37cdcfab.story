Chinese authorities have seized almost 8,000 rolls of toilet paper and another 20,000 packages of tissues embossed with unflattering images of Hong Kong's pro-Beijing chief executive.  

The items  - featuring Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying - were to be sold at a market in Hong Kong during Lunar New Year celebrations later this month. 

They were bought by the Hong Kong Democratic Party, which is said to have made HK$100,000 (£8,500) selling 4,000 rolls of the same toilet paper last year. 

The party's Vice Chairman Lo Kin-hei said it planned to earn more cash this year by selling the products during the island's Lunar New Year fair.

Chinese authorities have seized almost 8,000 rolls of the toilet paper and another 20,000 packages of tissues embossed with unflattering images of Hong Kong's pro-Beijing chief executive

The seizure came after Hong Kong was shaken by a massive pro-democracy movement in which demonstrators demanded greater electoral freedom than Beijing is willing to grant. 

During the demonstrations, protesters expressed anger at chief executive Leung Chun-ying, calling him a puppet of Beijing, and asked him to step down.

No reason was given for the seizure of the 12,900 dollars worth (£8,500) of goods in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, Mr Lo said.

'I guess (the Chinese authorities) don't like people mocking government officials, especially high-ranking government officials, after the movement. They have become more cautious about criticisms about them,' he said.

The party's 4,000 rolls of toilet paper with Mr Leung's image sold out at last year's seasonal market, and it decided to get more this year from a factory in Shenzhen, Mr Lo said.

The images of Mr Leung see him bearing two fangs, and another has the word 'lying' on his forehead. The sickle-and-hammer symbol of the Communist Party of China also appears on some products.

The order was placed under the name of a friend to obscure the party as the true buyer, and all communications were done through the friend instead of the party, Mr Lo said.

He declined to reveal the factory's name and said he had no information on the whereabouts of the factory owner. 'We are worried about what has happened to him,' Mr Lo said.

Mr Lo said the seizure indicates further tightening by Chinese authorities on freedom of speech, which is guaranteed in Hong Kong's constitution.

'Many productions in Hong Kong rely on the mainland. This kind of tightening means in the future it will be more difficult to make products in the mainland.

'It's alarmful for Hong Kong people that they keep suppressing freedom in Hong Kong. We will become the mainland if this kind of mocking will be not allowed in Hong Kong.'

The march is the first large-scale demonstration since the Occupy Central protest ended last year as the government started a second round of public consultation on democratic reform. The banner reads: 'No fake democracy, I want genuine universal suffrage'
