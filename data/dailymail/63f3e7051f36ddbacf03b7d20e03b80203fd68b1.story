A 40-year-old man who murdered his mother, sister and her children because she was stopping him from being with his 'one true love', the actress Selena Gomez, has been ruled unfit to stand trial.

Daniel Green, from Oklahoma City, will instead be sent to the Oklahoma Forensic Center in Vinita in the hope he may regain his sanity and face a jury for the crime.

He is accused of shooting dead his mother, Sallie Green, 57, his sister, Rebecca Cizek, 34, and her children, 16-year-old Katherine Cizek and six-month-old Amario Dominguez III in August last year.

Following their deaths, detectives found Green's Facebook page to be littered with pictures and posts about Gomez, including many that suggested he was fantasizing about an imaginary relationship with the Disney star.

In one message, he wrote: ‘I want Selena to be my eternal wife and the queen of my kingdom forever. Hey, I love her more than God, my momma, my dad, Jesus, myself and y’all.'

After his arrest, he told police he had to get away from his family members because they were stopping him from being with his 'one true love', the affidavit states.

He was arrested near a 7-11 store a couple of hours after a family friend raised the alarm at around 11pm after finding bloody footprints on the doormat, and the bodies.

The state medical examiner said Mrs Green and the baby died of gunshot wounds to the head. It has not yet been revealed how Ms Cizek and her teenage daughter died, according to The Oklahoman.

Helicopters were used to search for Green and police circulated his description to nearby stores after neighbors told them the 40-year-old was often seen pacing the sidewalk and buying energy drinks.

'This person is obviously significantly troubled, then that frustration and those problems may build up to the point that he felt like he had no other options,' Dr Steven Sternlof said.

He added that although he had not met Green or treated him, he could recognize the warning signs, News 9 reported.

'Someone that may have an obsession, in this case with a celebrity, might have a compulsion to respond in a certain way, thinking that this celebrity is in love with them or they're in love with the celebrity and they need to be close together, and they may need to stop others that are interfering in that relationship,' Dr Sternlof said.

In his Facebook posts, Green makes constant reference to Gomez and posted a threat against her celebrity boyfriend in October 2011, saying: 'Justin Bieber is going to get a bullet in his head'.

Neighbors claimed Green often spoke to them about his past lives or was seen talking to himself, according to NewsChannel 4.

One of his alleged victims, Katherine, had been due to start her sophomore year at Del City High School on Monday.

A statement from the school district said: 'The faculty and staff of Mid-Del Schools is mourning the loss of one its students today, Katherine Cizek, Del City High School sophomore. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to the family during this time of tragic loss.'

The Sonic drive-in, where her mother had worked, also released a statement expressing its grief at the loss of Ms Cizek, who had worked for them for 15 years.
