Since 1978, millions of tiny plastic people have been populating the Earth.

And now it is predicted that there could be a miniature Lego figure for every person on Earth in 2019.

According to a mathematical online comic, Lego has been making its little people at such a rate that they will outnumber the human population by the end of the decade.

A physics graduate from Massachusetts, who is behind the web comic Xkcd.com has calculated that the predictions for the global population and predictions for the number of Lego Figurines will match up in 2019 and the little plastic people will go on to out-number humans

At the end of 2006, the company 
announced there were four billion miniature figures in existence, being 
played with by children across the planet.

Now, a physics graduate from Massachusetts, who is behind the web comic Xkcd.com has calculated that the predictions for the global population and predictions for the number of Lego Figurines will match up in 2019 and the plastic people will go on to out-number humans.

If the predictions are correct, there will be almost eight billion people and the same amount of Lego figures calling Earth home in 2019.

Lego said in 2008 that it has made 400 
billion Lego bricks since the company began, which is enough for 62 each
 for every person in existence at that time.

According to a mathematical online comic, Lego has been making its little people at such a rate that they will outnumber the human population by the end of the decade. Here, s model maker at Legoland Windsor puts the finishing touches to a wall made up of over 6,000 Lego figures

The first Lego figurine went on sale in 1978 and since then, billions have been produced, making them the world's biggest population group, according to the company.

The mini figure has been modelled after celebrities from Stephen Spielberg to Santa Claus and enjoyed various careers, including astronaut, policeman, racing driver, warrior, pirate, skater and scientist as well as taken on the role of fictional characters like Spider-Man, Harry Potter and Yoda.

Lego said that when the mini figure first appeared, it was decided that its face should have only one colour - yellow - and that its facial features should be happy and neutral.

However earlier this year, robot experts at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, studied all 6000 minifigures from 1975 to 2010 and found that from the early Nineties onwards, Lego's mini-figures' facials expressions have been diversifying from consistently happy smiles to expressions reflecting greater conflict.

The first figures had no sex, race or specific role, as these would be determined by a child's imagination and it was not until the launch of Lego Pirates in the 1980s that the figures were given differing facial expressions.

In 2003, with the launch of Lego Basketball, it was decided that the little characters should finally have authentic skin colours as well as resembling characters as closely as possible - as was seen in the Harry Potter sets.
