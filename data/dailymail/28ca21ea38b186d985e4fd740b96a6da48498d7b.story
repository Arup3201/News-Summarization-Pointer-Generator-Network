Xabi Alonso has been banned from Real Madrid's next European match for his touchline celebration towards the end of last season's Champions League final win against Atletico.

The Spanish midfielder was banned for the match and as such could not be on the bench but, when Gareth Bale scored what proved to be the winning goal, he ran down the touchline to join his team-mates in celebration.

Atletico coach Diego Simeone has also been handed a one-match ban for his conduct towards Real defender Raphael Varane.

Simeone went on to the pitch twice during extra time of his team's 4-1 loss in May, and confronted Varane, who had kicked a ball toward the Atletico dugout after the last goal.

During an often physical match, seven Atletico players and five from Real were booked.

For improper conduct by their players and for fans setting off fireworks, Atletico have been fined £16,500 and Real £14,250.
