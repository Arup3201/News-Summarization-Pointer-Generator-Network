A 10-year-old girl who was reported missing from her California home overnight has been found 12 hours later, shoeless in front of a Starbucks coffee shop.

Sgt. Rudy Lopez says the girl, who's identity is being withheld, was apparently spotted by someone who recognized her from information that had been publicized and contacted the Police Department.

The girl with distinctive long red hair was found at mid-afternoon in Woodland Hills about six miles from her home in the Northridge area of Los Angeles.

Happy end: Nicole Ryan, 10, has been found outside Starbucks about six miles from her home some 12 hours after her disappearance

Mystery: The girl suffered lacerations and bruises to her face, had no shoes on and was dressed differently from the clothes she was wearing before she went missing

Her parents reported her missing from home before dawn Wednesday.

Police say the child was dropped off by an unknown person in a parking lot near a Goodwill store shortly before 3pm.

A female passerby recognized the girl from the news by her distinctive red hair and alerted police. A patrol officer who responded to the 911 call arrived at Oxnard Street and Canoga Avenue and located the child.

She did not have shoes on and was dressed in a white T-shirt instead of the black shirt she was wearing the night before.

'Her face was white. She looked very 
tired and worried,' Nicolas Jackson, manager of an animation studio
who spotted the girl next to Starbucks, told the Los Angeles Times. 'You could see she had some 
worries for the past few hours.'

First aid: Nicole was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital for treatment

Relieved: The girl's family were notified of her discovery and were later taken by car to the hospital to visit her

She was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital for treatment. According to authorities, the child 
suffered cuts and bruises to her face and appeared confused.

During a press conference Wednesday night, Los Angeles police officials said they were on the hunt for two men who are believed to have abducted Ryan overnight.

Capt. William Hayes told the LA Times that officers have secured several locations where the unidentified perpetrators had allegedly taken the 10-year-old girl using multiple cars in the process.

Police also said they have recovered a black pickup truck that was apparently involved in the kidnapping. 

She was last seen in her bedroom just after midnight at her home in Northridge, California.

When her parents checked on her at around 3am, she was gone, police spokesman Richard French said.

When her dissapperance was announced, French said there was no indication of foul play. No windows had been forced at the property although the back door to the home was left unlocked and a side gate was open. 

She was unable to reach the lock on the gate without help, an LAPD alert noted.

The parents said nothing happened in the house that might have prompted her child to run away.
