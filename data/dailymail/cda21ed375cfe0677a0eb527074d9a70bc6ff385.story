A 29-year-old burglar has been arrested after allegedly feeding two toddlers, taking a shower and eating a meal at a family's California home.

Jason Rutt entered three houses on Acorn Court in Pacific Grove through unlocked doors in the early hours of Thursday and stole items from their garages, police said.

In one of the cases, he reportedly made himself a meal, before venturing into the bedroom of two children, aged one and three, where he woke them up and fed them bananas.

He then allegedly went to the bathroom and took a shower. But as he was washing, the homeowners awoke to the sound of running water and called 999 as Rutt 'ran away' from the house.

'Rutt had entered the residence [on the 600 block of Acorn Road] through an unlocked door, Pacific Grove Police Commander Cassie McSorley told KSBW.

'He showered, ate, and then went into [the] children's bedroom and was apparently feeding the small children in their bedroom.'

She added that although the children were not harmed, their parents were 'obviously freaked out'.

Following the burglary, Rutt reportedly spent 13 hours wandering the forests of Pebble Beach and Pacific Grove while police searched for him. 

Forest Grove Elementary School, Pacific Grove High School, and Monterey Bay Charter School were placed on lockdowns as a K-9 unit and Monterey County sheriff's deputies scoured the area. 

However, Rutt was arrested that afternoon when an officer spotted him walking at the intersection of Patterson Lane and David Avenue, outside Monterey Bay Charter School.

Rutt, who was on probation for burglary at the time of the alleged break-ins, was taken into custody at Montery County Jail just before 5.30pm.

He is believed to have 'a history of mental illness', according to NBC Bay Area. His family members are said to be cooperating with police.

On Friday, police sergeant Roxane Viray urged locals to lock the doors to their homes, saying: 'Although Pacific Grove is a small community and crime is rare here, we want everyone to be safe.'
