A 15-year-old girl, who was allegedly raped by her step-father, has been sentenced by a court in the Maldives to 100 lashes for having pre-marital sex with another man.

Police in the strict Islamic country had been investigating allegations the girl had been abused by her stepfather for years when they uncovered new evidence.

The girl and her step-father were first 
arrested after the body of a baby she had given birth to was found 
buried outside their house on Feydhoo in June 2012.

Punishment: A 15-year-old girl, who was allegedly sexually abused by her stepfather for years, has been sentenced to 100 lashes in the Maldives for having pre-marital sex

Her stepfather, who had reportedly been abusing the girl for years, is reportedly facing 25 years in prison for the rape and allegedly killing a baby conceived from it. 

He has been charged with sexually abusing a minor, possessing pornography, and murder, while her mother has been charged with concealing a crime and murder.

The girl later admitted to police that she had had consensual sex with another man.It is not known whether he will face charges.

Court officials have said the flogging, will be carried out once the girl turns 18. Until that time she will be under house arrest.

The Maldivian government has reportedly urged the court to show leniency describing the girl as having been 'traumatised' by the rape.

Amnesty International described the charges against he girl as 'outrageous'.

A spokesman said: 'Victims of rape or other forms of sexual abuse should be given counselling and support – not charged with a crime.

'Flogging is a violation of the absolute prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.

'The Maldivian authorities should immediately end its use regardless of circumstances. The fact that this time a 15-year old girl who has suffered terribly is at risk makes it all the more reprehensible'.

'Flogging is not only wrong and humiliating, but can lead to long-term psychological as well as physical scars.'
