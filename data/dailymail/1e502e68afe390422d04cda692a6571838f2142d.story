Russia's ancient order of soldiers, the Cossacks, have been drafted in to help with security in the Winter Olympics in Sochi, only a week before they begin.

Hundreds of the soldiers, wearing their traditional jackets and fur hats, are now marching the streets of Sochi as the games approach.

The arrival of the soldiers has coincided with a recent warning by British anti-terror chiefs that a large scale terror attack on the 2014 Winter Olympics is 'very likely to occur'.

The Russian soldiers' ancestry dates back thousands of years, with their most well known trait in western culture being their gravity-defying dance.

In their home country, they are more synonymous with rebellion and strong military force, with this reputation being enhanced by the literature of Russian novelists Leo Tolstoy and Alexander Pushkin.

However, their military might may be used in action against the threat assessment made by Whitehall officials that a Caucasus group, Imarat Kavkaz (IK) are likely to carry out an attack after months of continued threats against the games.

The assessment points out that in July 2013, the leader of the group, Emir Doku Umarov, called on his followers to do what they can to disrupt the games.

However, the report questioned the groups ability to schedule and carry out an attack with such a short time until the games.

This warning came after both a twin bomb attacks on the city of Volgograd in December that killed 34 people, and the hunt for a suspected suicide bomber, Ruzanna Ibragimova, who is thought to be part of a larger terrorist group of female suicide bombers called the 'black widows', named because they are the widows of militants.

In addition to the Cossack's installation, British intelligence says that 37,000 soldiers and police have been drafted in to boost security in Sochi, and that they are forming a 'ring of steel' perimeter around the event, making it a much harder target for attacks.

The warning by British Intelligence came after the bombing of Volgograd, which killed 34 people last year

Governor Aleksandr Tkachev of Russia's Krasnodar region, where Sochi is located said to local police: 'What you cannot do, a Cossack can.'

These comments caused outcry from natives of Sochi, as well as minorities and migrants, with analysts saying it is no coincidence that nationalism and xenophobia are on the rise at the same time the Cossacks are being revived.

The new role of the Cossack as hired enforcers may 'naturally translate into conflicts between the indigenous population of the Northern Caucasus and the Cossacks' according to Valeriy Dzutsev, an analyst with the Jamestown Foundation, writing in the Central Asial-Caucasus Institute Analyst.

The Cossacks have long been known for 
rebelling against Russia's feudal system, allying with Russia's tsars to
 help create the Russian Empire, with their warrior skills aiding Russia
 to conquer large parts of the country.

Over
 time they eventually got a reputation as the tsar's henchmen, before 
the Russian empire realised they were not able to fully control them.

The tsars and Cossacks found 
themselves united during the rise of the Bolsheviks in the early 20th 
century, and when the Bolsheviks (later communists) came to power they 
massacred many Cossacks because of their opposition to the revolution.

Following
 the fall of the Soviet Union, there has been a revival of Cossack 
culture, with the Russian Empire turning more and more to the Cossacks 
as a bolster to security during nationwide events, including the 
forthcoming Winter Olympics.
