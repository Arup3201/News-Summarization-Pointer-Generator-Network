Child heart surgery is to be resumed at Leeds General Infirmary amid claims of a ‘shambles’ over the decision to suspend operations on safety grounds.

Parents, MPs and campaigners have demanded to know how the troubled unit came to be closed over safety concerns – only to re-open within a week.

Some claimed the decision had been ‘reckless’ – while the NHS and trust bosses maintained they were forced to act after seeing data that suggested death rates were double the national average.

Children's heart surgery is set to resume at Leeds General Infirmary after days of uncertainty over its future. It was closed last week after figures emerged suggesting high death rates

But last night worrying new evidence emerged of the problems at the unit.

All child operations at the Leeds unit were halted on Maundy Thursday 
following the release of NHS figures suggesting its death rate was 
double that of other centres, and a ‘constellation’ of issues.

But a decision was reached at a summit between Leeds Teaching Hospitals 
NHS Trust, NHS England and other organisations on Thursday to aim to 
re-open the unit early next week.

Treated at Leeds: Imogen-Rose, right, was saved by surgery after doctors said they should abort her. Eve Burton, right, had a heart defect and died after an operation at Leeds for a heart defect

Some parents of children treated at the unit, as well as MPs and 
campaigners, have welcomed the news. But others said questions still 
needed to be answered about the problems at the unit.

Emma Ethelstone, 28, and John Sauve, 37, say they were left ‘devastated’
by the way they were treated at Leeds.  The couple were told by doctors
at the unit that their longed-for baby daughter had such severe 
congenital heart disease that they had no choice but to abort her.

Conflict: Sir Bruce Keogh's decision to close the unit came just 24 hours after Mrs Justice Nicola Davies ruled further consultation was necessary

Leeds General Infirmary is at the centre of a long-running row over the future of children's heart services at the hospital.

The NHS 
announced last July it wanted to close three units and keep seven open, the idea being to concentrate specialist services in 
fewer but larger centres that would give a higher quality of care for 
child heart patients.

Those currently chosen to stay open are at Bristol, Birmingham, 
Liverpool, Newcastle, Southampton and two London centres.

Facing closure are units at Leicester’s Glenfield Hospital, London’s Royal Brompton and the Leeds site.

This means patients in Yorkshire would be being forced to travel to Liverpool or Newcastle for treatment - a 150 or 200-mile round trip respectively.

There is 
huge support for keeping child heart surgery in the Yorkshire and nearly
600,000 people signed a petition against closure of the unit, oragnised by the group Save Our Surgery (SOS).

Last month, a High Court judge derailed plans to close the unit because of the ‘secretive’ approach of NHS chiefs.

Mrs 
Justice Davies backed claims by SOS that 
the consultation process to decide which units should be axed was unfair
because details of how a panel of experts marked individual hospitals 
were kept secret.

Last week, she ruled the decision was 'unfair and legally flawed'.

But 
within 24 hours, Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, had 
travelled to Leeds to suspend congenital heart surgery after data 
emerged suggesting it had a death rate twice the national average.

He said the figures were among a 'constellation of reasons' behind the suspension.

Miss Ethelstone – who was 26 weeks pregnant – was told ‘not to Google’ her baby’s condition as it wouldn’t be helpful.

When the couple ignored this advice and looked up the condition on the 
internet, they were shocked to discover that there was in fact an 
operation that could help.

Miss Ethelstone then emailed every hospital in England specialising in 
complex heart conditions – and the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle said 
they could offer the surgery.

Their baby daughter Imogen-Rose was born there on March 5 and given open
heart surgery four days later. She will need further operations but she
is now a healthy one-month-old.

Miss Ethelstone said: ‘We felt like a piece of meat on a conveyer belt. 
It didn’t seem like they were talking about my little girl – they kept 
calling her the foetus.’

But when they went to Newcastle, medics had a totally different attitude, she said.

‘They gave us hope. I just want to advise other expectant mothers to always seek a 2nd 3rd 4th opinion.’

Helen Burton, 39, is among those calling for a full investigation into 
deaths at the hospital. She lost her only child, seven-year-old Eve, 
last March after an operation at Leeds to rectify a congenital heart 
defect.

After Eve’s death, Miss Burton complained to the hospital about her 
daughter’s care, including why the operation was delayed until Eve was 
seven, when the average age for such a procedure is apparently four.

She
also says she was not fully briefed on either the risks involved, or 
exactly what went wrong during the surgery.

Responding to the news that the unit is to resume operations she said: 
‘It seems back-to-front to me to announce it will re-open before they 
have had assurances that the unit is safe. This is too important to be 
rushed.’

Greg Mulholland, Liberal Democrat MP for Leeds North West, who has 
campaigned to keep the unit after its closure was recommended in a 
nationwide review, called on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to launch an 
investigation into how the hospital’s closure had been handled.

He said: ‘I’m afraid the communication from NHS England has been woeful 
and the handling has been deeply questionable, and indeed the motivation
behind the decision in the first place is something that I think people
want to get to the bottom of.’

Parents had criticised the timing of the unit’s suspension, which came 
just 24 hours after a High Court judge ruled that a decision-making 
process to close it as part of an England-wide reorganisation of 
services was ‘legally flawed’.

Sharon Cheng, of the Save Our Surgery group, which ran the campaign to 
save children’s heart surgery at Leeds, said: ‘Many children are reliant
on the Leeds unit for urgent or on-going treatment, so the sooner 
normal service can be resumed, the better.’

But Anne Keatley-Clarke, chief executive of the Children’s Heart 
Federation, said families needed full disclosure on the investigations 
that had taken place because they were still ‘very worried’ about their 
children and frightened about raising concerns.

She said parents who had raised concerns in public had been subject to harassment and bullying.

The hospital is at the centre of a long-running row over the future of its children's heart services

Ian Dalton, deputy chief executive and chief operating officer of NHS 
England, said: ‘The risk summit concluded that surgery could restart at 
the beginning of next week, subject to independent validation of the 
clinical data and an external review of clinical governance processes.

‘We expect this work to be completed over the next few days and a conclusion reached early next week.’

A spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals said: ‘We cannot comment on 
individual cases but we would be very happy to talk to families if they 
would like to contact the hospital to discuss any concerns.’
