Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson is reported to have reached a plea agreement that will allow him to plead no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault and therefore avoid prison.

The deal would allow the football star to avoid a felony child-abuse conviction and instead be sentenced to probation and community service, plus a monetary fine.

The disgraced football star, 29, had faced one felony count of reckless injury to a child after he was accused of striking his four-year-old son with a tree branch or switch at his gated mansion in The Woodlands.

Vikings running back Peterson (seen in court with wife Ashley Brown) is reported to have reached a plea agreement that will allow him to plead no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault - and avoid jail time

If the agreement is accepted by Judge Kelly Case, Peterson will pay a $2,000 fine, be placed on probation, and perform 80 hours of community service, reports Pro Football Talk.

Peterson’s plea, which comes less than four weeks before his trial on felony child-abuse charges was due to start, will not include reference to family violence or violence against a minor.

Once Tuesday’s court appearance is out of the way, Peterson’s case becomes a pressing concern for the NFL who will quickly have to decide if they are going to impose a suspension on the running back above and beyond the eight games he has already missed with pay.

Unless he is suspended for more than eight games, Peterson could be reinstated for the Vikings' next game against the Chicago Bears on November 16.

Officially, Peterson remains on the commissioner's exempt list and is barred from all team activities.

Peterson was due back in court on Tuesday for a hearing to revoke his bond after he allegedly admitted to smoking marijuana before his initial hearing in September. 

According to court documents, Peterson allegedly told a drug-testing administrator that he had recently 'smoke a little weed' before submitting to a urinalysis test.

'During this process the defendant admitted ... that he smoked a little weed,' according to the motion filed by Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon.  

Peterson (above with one of his sons)  was arrested and posted $15,000 bond on September 12 on a charge of injury to a child

Peterson was arrested and posted $15,000 bond on September 12 on a charge of injury to a child. He was later suspended indefinitely with pay by the Vikings until the matter is resolved.

He has admitted using a switch, the thin end of a tree branch, to discipline his son, but said he was not trying to injure him.

Peterson could have been sentenced to up to two years in prison and fined $10,000 if convicted.

The charge against Peterson came as the NFL faced public criticism for its handling of a spate of domestic violence cases among its players. 

A number of corporate sponsors rebuked America's most popular professional sports league, which has overhauled how it deals with player behavior and punishment.
