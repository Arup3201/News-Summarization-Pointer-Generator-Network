Revealed: David Cameron, pictured today, has spoken about how a hoax caller was put through to his mobile just by claiming he was the director of GCHQ

David Cameron has today revealed the moment a drunk hoax caller high on cocaine and cannabis was put through to his mobile as he carried his daughter on a family walk as part of his new pre-election fitness regime. 

The caller, who bragged later: 'I was off my face', said he was the head of spy agency GCHQ Robert Hannigan and was put through to the Prime Minister by the Downing Street switchboard. 

Mr Cameron asked him: 'Who is this?'' and quickly ended the call when the prankster could only say: 'It is a hoax call'.

Downing Street and the security services have now launched a major review of procedures following the breach, although Mr Cameron has said nobody would be sacked and no crime was committed.

The Prime Minister has revealed the call came after he returned from Saudi Arabia to pay his respects after the death of King Abdullah and he was enjoying a 'very nice walk' with his family when his mobile rang.

He said: 'I had Florence on my back to add to the exercise regime that I'm undertaking. My Blackberry went in my pocket, I answered it and it claimed to be a conference call established – which I do obviously very frequently – between the head of GCHQ and some of the staff in my office. 

'A voice came through, a voice I didn't recognise. The voice said he said he was sorry to wake me up, which I thought was strange as it was eleven o'clock in the morning, and so I quite rapidly asked 'who is this?', to which the answer came 'it is a hoax call', and so I pushed the red button on the Blackberry which ended the call.

'That is what happened so no harm was done, no national security was breached, but it is important when these things happen to make sure we do everything we can to put in place systems to we weed out hoax calls, but every now and again, I suspect these things will happen'.  

The call followed a separate astonishing security lapse earlier in the day when a caller, believed to be the same man, was given a mobile number for GCHQ director Mr Hannigan after he rang the organisation.

The unnamed man, described as well-educated and in his twenties, told a newspaper: 'I've just made complete monkeys out of GCHQ. I got the mobile number of a director.  What's more, I'm off my face on booze and cocaine. I had some spliff too. I've been up all night, I'm utterly wasted – hilarious.'

Security breach: The Prime Minister (pictured in July last year) received the hoax call on an official mobile phone after the caller claimed to be Robert Hannigan, the director of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)

The man, who sounded well educated and in his twenties, added: 'What's really funny is that GCHQ believe the word of someone so smashed they can hardly string a sentence together.'

He had started making the calls in the early hours of Sunday morning.

First he called the GCHQ switchboard and said that he was an aide to the Prime Minister from Downing Street.

Breach: A caller was given a mobile number for GCHQ director Mr Hannigan after he rang the organisation, who gave him the director's private mobile number

He had told the operator that Robert Hannigan was not answering his 'usual number' so the GCHQ employee gave him the director's personal blackberry.

Mr Hannigan is then said to have received a call from a man claiming to be a journalist from ITN - and then ended the call.

Security officials have insisted that it was not the line used by the GCHQ chief for 'secure' top secret calls on matters of national security.

On Sunday morning the same caller is said to have impersonated Mr Hannigan after calling the Downing Street switchboard - who put him through to the Prime Minister.

All this was done by a man who 'couldn't string a sentence together', he said. 

Treasury minister Priti Patel insisted Downing Street takes security 'very, very seriously'.

She told Sky News: 'There will now be a security review in light of what has happened. We've had an issue here, it's quite right and proper that GCHQ and Downing Street… look at the details of this… and they will have a thorough investigation. That is the right approach.'

Downing Street last night insisted no confidential information had been disclosed by the Prime Minister. But both No 10 and GCHQ, which eavesdrops on the phone calls of terror suspects and criminals, launched immediate inquiries into the security breach.

Last night no one had claimed responsibility for either of the calls. It was unclear if they were by the same person.

Attention is likely to focus on computer hackers or self-styled internet privacy campaigners unhappy with the Prime Minister's stance on state surveillance.

Downing Street said no sensitive information was disclosed during the 'quite brief' conversation and said Mr Cameron ended the call upon realising it was a hoax. Security procedures at No.10 are now under review

Blunder: An operator at GCHQ in Cheltenham appears to have handed over the number

In the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks, he has called for greater powers to allow GCHQ to monitor the content of calls, emails and social media. 

Early hours of Sunday morning: Hoaxer calls GCHQ switchboard and says that he is an aide from Downing Street. Tells operator that director Robert Hannigan was not answering his 'usual number' so the GCHQ employee promptly gave him the director's personal blackberry.

Then calls Mr Hannigan claiming to be a journalist - and the spy chief hangs up.

11am Sunday: Same caller telephones the Downing Street switchboard pretending to be Robert Hannigan.

He is then put through to the Prime Minister and has a 'brief' conversation before David Cameron ends the call.

It’s not clear whether the man was put straight through by the switchboard or after being transferred to someone else.

He provoked alarm among some privacy campaigners by suggesting services such as WhatsApp should not be able to encrypt messages in a way they cannot be read by spies.

A Government spokesman said: 'Following two hoax calls to Government departments today, a notice has gone out to all departments to be on the alert for such calls.

'In the first instance, a call was made to GCHQ which resulted in the disclosure of a mobile phone number for the director. 

'The mobile number provided is never used for calls involving classified information. In the second instance, a hoax caller claiming to be the GCHQ director was connected to the Prime Minister. 

'The Prime Minister ended the call when it became clear it was a hoax.' 

Mr Cameron is not the first high profile victim of a prank call.

A hoaxer in December 2012 sparked tragedy when an Australian radio station succeeded in getting through to a hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for morning sickness. 

The prank led to the death of nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who took her own life after transferring the call.

In 1995, the Queen spoke to a prank caller for 17 minutes – believing the person was the Canadian prime minister.  

In 1995, the Queen spoke to a prank caller for 17 minutes, believing the person at the end of the line to be the Canadian Prime Minister and in 1998, Tony Blair (right) took a call which he believed to be from William Hague

During the call, taken at Buckingham Palace, she promised the man, who claimed to be Jean Chretien, that she would try to influence a referendum being held in Canada. 

In fact, the caller was a Canadian impressionist Pierre Brassard calling on behalf of radio station CKOI FM in Montreal.

Former prime minister Tony Blair also fell for a prank call from a radio station. In 1998, he took a call which he believed to be from then Tory leader William Hague. 

The caller was in fact Steve Penk – a DJ from Capital FM. Within moments, Mr Blair realised that the call was a fake but played along with the joke.

David Cameron is not the first Prime Minister to have a phone hoaxer put through to him.

Radio host Steve Penk played the trick on Tony Blair as he left his morning briefing in 1998, right at the time, with the help of impressionist Jon Culshaw.

Culshaw put on the voice of then-leader of the opposition William Hague, and a Downing Street operator put him through.

The impressionist told Mr Blair he was ringing to see how he was and the prime minister laughed along and said: 'That's quite a good imitation.'

Mr Blair knew it was not his Tory rival because  Culshaw called him 'Tony', whereas Mr Hague would always have used 'prime minister'.

One of the most famous hoax calls ever staged came some three years earlier when the Queen chatted on air to a Canadian DJ pretending to be Canadian prime minister Jean Chretien.

Pierre Brassard got through to Buckingham Palace, spoke to the monarch on-air for 15 minutes and elicited a promise for her to influence Quebec's referendum on proposals to break away from Canada.

The Queen did not know it was a hoax with the Palace later describing the incident as 'irritating and regrettable'.

On another occasion, Brassard spoke to pope John Paul II, asking the pontiff if he had ever thought of fixing a toy propeller to his cap.

In 2003, Miami radio station El Zol spoke to late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez pretending to be Cuban president Fidel Castro before reversing the prank by calling Castro posing as Chavez.

Castro famously lost his temper and swore at the DJs live on air after they revealed that 'the whole of Miami' had been listening in on the joke.

One of the most recent notorious pranks  led to the death of a nurse at a hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for morning sickness.

Australian DJs Mel Greig and Mike Christian called King Edward VII hospital impersonated the Queen and Prince Charles to ask staff questions about the Duchess's health.

Indian-born nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who transferred the call to a duty nurse, was found dead three days after the prank was broadcast in December 2012.
