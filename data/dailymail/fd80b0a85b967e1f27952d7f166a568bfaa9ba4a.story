Parents revealed their anger today over revelations that schools have been testing their children for sexually transmitted infections during lessons.

Blatchington Mill School in Hove, East Sussex, is one of those giving pupils aged 15 or 16 the chance to do a chlamydia STI test as part of their personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education.

The scheme is part of a council-supported initiative offering Yeah 11 children chlamydia tests in school, to which nine secondary schools in Brighton and Hove have now signed up.

Parents at Blatchington Mill were 
shocked at not being told their children were being offered the test - 
with one mother saying her Year 11 daughter refused because she ‘felt 
uncomfortable with it’.

She told the Brighton Argus newspaper:
 ‘I didn’t know anything about it beforehand and I think the school 
should have let us know as parents that our children were going to be 
asked to do this.

Defence: Ashley Harrold, deputy headteacher at Blatchington Mill, said the tests were part of an NHS strategy that had been running for about four years

‘I
 know the tests were done by the students in the toilets, but I think 
it’s humiliating to ask teenagers in class to do a test for an STI.’

Ashley
 Harrold, deputy headteacher at Blatchington Mill, told the local 
newspaper that the tests were part of an NHS strategy that had been 
running for about four years and involved other schools.

The school said the lessons 
aimed to give youngsters informed choices about their sex lives, and 
normalising the STI test, adding that parents can withdraw their 
children from sex education classes.

A statement said: ‘As part of the session all learners are offered the opportunity (no one is made to do it) to do a chlamydia test during the lesson in an effort to normalise taking a chlamydia test.

‘It is not anticipated that a great number of these will return a positive result, it is more an exercise to demonstrate how easy and painless doing one is and to reinforce in their minds how and where they can do the test should they need to in the future.

‘Most young people do not become sexually active before the age of 16 and all sessions will be delivered within a framework of normative approaches, reminding young people that the legal age of consent for sexual activity in the UK is 16 and encouraging students to explore attitudes surrounding peer pressure, media influence and making positive decisions about relationships.

‘Research shows that this type of 
provision does not encourage sexual activity.

The sessions held for pupils at schools in East Sussex are part of the National Chlamydia Screening Programme, which was set up by the Department of Health in 2003. 

It aims to offer opportunistic testing to all young people between 15 and 24 years old, and to treat those who test positive for the STI. 

A school nurse can test someone under 16 for chlamydia without the knowledge of their parent or guardian as long as they understand the advice they have been given.

Health professionals are also told to try to persuade the young person to tell their parents or guardians about the test.

But patient confidentiality can be broken if the nurse discovers the child is at risk of harm.

Other areas with schools that have tested pupils for chlamydia in the past include the Wirral in Merseyside and Redbridge in London.

'The purpose of this 
programme is to support young people to start making healthy choices 
around their health, understand what to expect from screening and help 
them to engage with local health services, in a supportive environment.’

Brighton and Hove City Council said 
the sessions were part of the National Chlamydia Screening Programme, in
 partnership with the local NHS provider.

Mr Harrold added: ‘It is an NHS strategy where, to demystify the test, they can have one to take away and try. We did receive a complaint from a parent and we take them very seriously.’

Meanwhile, parent Tina Daniels, 44, said she was also shocked when her daughter told her that STI tests had taken place at Patcham High School in the city.

She said: ‘I am all for educating our youngsters on sex education issues and for some teenagers these clinics could be beneficial. But I think it's important for parents to be made aware that these facilities are available for their children.’

A Brighton and Hove City Council spokesman said: ‘Our work with schools in this area is entirely consistent with Government guidelines.’

Chlamydia is one of the most common STIs in Britain, with more than 200,000 people testing positive for it in 2012. Around two-thirds of people diagnosed with chlamydia were aged under 25.
