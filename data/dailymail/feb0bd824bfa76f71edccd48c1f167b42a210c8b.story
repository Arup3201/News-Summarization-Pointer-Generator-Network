Tottenham playmaker Erik Lamela believes he is close to rediscovering the form that led Spurs to sign him for a club record fee of £30 million from Roma in 2013.

A mix of injuries, squad rotation and a struggle to adapt to the English style of play has meant that Spurs fans are yet to see much of a return on their investment.

But now, after a glittering display in his last appearance against Leicester in the FA Cup fourth round, the 22-year-old feels he is ready to start making good on his price tag.

'I lost a bit of physical condition during the time I was out injured but the 90 minutes against Leicester helped me a lot and in these coming days I expect to be back at peak level,' Lamela told the Evening Standard. 

'I think I'm getting used to English football and I think I have improved a lot, but I can still give a lot more. I can score many more goals, too, because I'm not doing that as much as I did earlier in my career.

'I'm starting to show something of what I can do. I'm training very hard to reach that level and I'm working hard to achieve that every day. I'm very happy playing wide on the right of the attack, which I feel is my best position.'

Despite Lamela's own impressive performance, Tottenham went on to lose to Leicester 2-1 and are out of the FA Cup.

However, they remain in the League Cup and hold a 1-0 aggregate lead over Sheffield United, going into the second leg of the semi-final this coming Wednesday.

Spurs have not won a major trophy since lifting the League Cup in 2008.
