Nathan Grindal has been banned from attending a darts match - because he looks too much like Jesus

A long-haired and bearded darts fan has been banned from attending a match - because he looks too much like Jesus.

Mild-mannered Nathan Grindal was enjoying the clash between Phil Taylor and Kim Huybrechts last year when some of the audience at the Cash Converter Players Championship spotted his likeness to the son of God.

As rowdy chants of 'Jesus' quickly spread through the crowd packed into Butlins at Minehead, Somerset, security staff were called and Mr Grindal was ejected for fear he was ruining the concentration of ex-world champ Taylor and his Belgian rival.

But this year, Mr Grindal was not even allowed in - despite spending £450 on the return trip.

He said he went to collect his tickets when 'two big beef-head security guards, including the head of security, dragged me into the office where they told me they wouldn't let me watch the darts this year.

'I felt quite intimidated. The head of security told me they would not be letting me into the tournament, because they did not want a repeat of last year.

'It's not my fault I look like Jesus. I’m not trying to look like Jesus, I’m not even religious - I’m just an average Joe. I haven’t done anything wrong.'

The labourer, from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, has been to at least six darts events without incident since he was removed by six bouncers from last year's tournament.

But this year, he was told to pack his bags and be gone by 2pm.

'I booked the tickets back in 
February in my own name and nobody said there was a problem, and I even 
managed to get some VIP tickets sorted,' he said.

'We checked in, had a couple of beers with our breakfast, and then decided to go and collect the VIP tickets.

'When I got there a lady at the counter asked if I was the Jesus bloke who came to the darts.

'She
told me she was there last year, and thought it was hilarious, 
especially when a bloke in a wheelchair stood up and walked in front of 
me.

'Up until this point, nobody had recognised me at all.'

Mr Grindal, who has survived skin cancer twice, started growing his beard last year and keeps it long to hide scars.

He was mobbed by fans as he left last years match, desperate for a picture with him.

Devastated: Mr Grindal was kicked out of Butlins, complete with his fancy dress outfit

At the time he said: 'I signed a few pieces of paper - but in my real name, not Jesus.

'In
his post-match interview, Phil Taylor said something like "if I ever 
see Jesus again, I'll crucify him myself". Now that's just hurtful.'

Butlins
has offered the messianic lookalike a full refund, but he said he wanted 
compensation for missing work and buying petrol for the 280-mile round 
trip.

'Security wanted me 
to leave as soon as possible, but obviously I didn't want to drink and 
drive,' he said. 'They made me sit in my apartment like a dog for four 
hours until I was certain the two beers I had had gone out of my system.

'They were guarding my door - I felt like a criminal, and very intimidated.

'At the end of the day, I'm an adult and I feel they could have dealt with the situation a lot better.

'I'm being discriminated against because I look like the Son of God. It's really distressing.'

A
Butlins spokesman said: 'At last year's PDC Darts weekend at Butlins 
Minehead, Mr Grindal was ejected from the resort for causing disruption 
to the organisers, players and other guests on the break.

'This
weekend, based on his disruptive behaviour last year, both Butlins and 
PDC Darts, the organisers, have taken the decision not to allow Mr 
Grindal onto the resort.'

This year Michael van Gerwen claimed the 2013 title, beating previous champion Taylor 11-7.
