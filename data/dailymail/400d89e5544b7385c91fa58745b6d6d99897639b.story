Comedian Bill Cosby, who is facing sexual assault allegations from a string of women, was given a standing ovation by an audience in California at his latest show.

The 77-year-old was welcomed by the audience at the Turlock Community Theatre and they rose to their feet at the end of show, which is part of his comedy tour.

Only one protester showed up outside the venue in the central Californian city after Cosby began his tour in Denver, Colorado on Saturday.

The single demonstator, Suzette Sims, 51, who came with a sign that read 'I Believe The Women', said: 'It's sad. I am very disappointed there aren't more people.

'But someone has to stand up so I came.'

The comedian is facing sexual assault accusations from at least 15 women, with some of the claims dating back decades.

He has denied the allegations through his attorney and has never been charged with a crime.

Cosby kicked off his tour at the weekend in Colorado, where he released a statement thanking his fans for their support since the allegations surfaced.

He said: 'I have thousands of loyal, patient and courageous fans that are going to leave their homes to enjoy an evening of laughter and return home feeling wonderful.'

However, the show in Denver attracted 100 people who chanted 'Rape is not a joke!' and 'No means no!' outside the theater.

Protesters had also interrupted a handful of his previous shows with hecklers standing up and chanting repeatedly 'we believe the women' at Cosby's third and final performance of a Canadian tour earlier this month.

The protesters then marched out of the theatre as Cosby asked his audience not to react.

More recently, a model who claims Cosby drugged and sexually abused her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008 met with Los Angeles police on Wednesday to pursue criminal charges.

The comedian's tour comes as NBC's top entertainment executive has said the door is firmly shut to Cosby's return to the network. Thirty years ago, Cosby was the sitcom king with NBC's 'The Cosby Show'.

On Saturday, 100 protesters turned up at a theatre in Denver, where Cosby was performing, holding up signs and shouting 'Rape is no joke!'

But on Friday, the network's Entertainment Chairman, Bob Greenblatt, confirmed the network would never do a project with Cosby again.

Speaking with the Television Critics Association, Mr Greenblatt went on to explain: 'Fifteen women came out and accused him of what they accused him of. When that many people come out and have such similar complaints, it became a tainted situation.'

The network said late last year it was dropping plans to develop a 'classic' family sitcom with Cosby.
