Barcelona defender Gerard Pique has admitted that if he supported La Liga rivals Real Madrid, Spain team-mate Iker Casillas would be his 'idol'. 

The duo came face-to-face as rivals in Sunday's El Clasico as Barcelona defeated Real Madrid 2-1 to open up a four-point gap between the two clubs at the top of La Liga, with Pique being voted man of the match by his own fans. 

Madrid goalkeeper Casillas, on the other hand, hasn't had much too smile about lately and the 33-year-old has been on the receiving end of criticism this year after a number of high profile blunders.

But despite the club rivalry, Pique, who made his Spain debut in 2009 against England, has backed his international team-mate and has suggested some criticism is unfair.

'He has been one of the best goalkeepers in the world for many years,' he told Cadena SER. 

'To understand the whistles at the Santiago Bernabeu I guess you'd have to be there.

'If I was a supporter of Madrid, he'd be my idol, the standard I'd hold myself to. He is an example for all Madrid players.'

Pique and Casillas have been Spain team-mates since 2009 when the Barcelona defender made his debut 

Casillas and Pique have enjoyed success as international team-mates together having lifted the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 together,

However, Pique, 28, has admitted that he doubts he'll ever switch allegiances as he would find it hard to leave Barcelona for their arch rivals.   

'One can never say never, but I very much doubt it,' he added when asked if he'd ever consider a move to Real Madrid. 

'Barca have always been my team of choice.'
