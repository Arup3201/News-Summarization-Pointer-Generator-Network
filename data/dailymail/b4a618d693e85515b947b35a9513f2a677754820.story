Calorie counts on nutrition labels and restaurant menus are often incorrect, new evidence suggests.

Currently the Atwater system, developed by the U.S. chemist Wilbur Olin Atwater more than 100 years ago, is widely used to determine caloric values.

But now experts are calling for a more accurate method to be introduced as Atwater's calculations fail to take into account preparation and processing techniques which can affect the number of calories people consume.

Misleading: Experts are calling for a more reliable way of calculating calories in food stuffs as the current method fails to take into account various factors such as as preparation and processing techniques

Rachel Carmody from Harvard University, who is due to give a presentation on the subject at a meeting held by the American 
Association for the Advancement of Science this month, told Live Science: 'By getting a better understating of the effective calories in food, we'll get a better sense of human energy requirement.'

Ms Carmody previously found that people get more calories from processed foods - pureed vegetables or fruit for example - than unprocessed goods.

This is because it takes less energy to digest ingredients in liquid form than in their raw and natural state.

Explaining her findings she told MailOnline: 'The calorie values reported on food labels do not capture important costs of digestion that are typically lower for processed foods and higher for unmodified items.

'So although two foods might have the
 same number of calories on paper, these calories are not necessarily 
equally available to the body.

The table below reveals how foods measure up against 
the claim on the label.

'In some cases, reported calorie values could differ from actual energy harvest by as much as 50per cent.'

She is now hoping to encourage efforts to quantify calories in a more accurate way.

'Given that the Atwater system is 
treating essentially all foods the same, we aren’t getting a good 
perspective when it comes to making dietary choices.

'We can start to think of simple ways to improve [the system] that will be better for the average consumer,' she added.

In the late 19th century Atwater  conducted a series of experiments which involved burning samples of food and measuring the amount of energy released from the heat they produced.

He concluded that proteins and 
carbohydrates have about 4 calories per gram, fats have 9 calories per 
gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram.

Therefore an energy bar that contains 10g of protein, 20g of carbohydrate and 9g of fat would have 201 calories.

This simple formula is how many food manufacturers calculate the calories in foods.

In the Seventies, researchers introduced 
modified  Atwater values that were intended for specific foods, such as 
fruits, vegetables and beans, but since then there have been little changes.

Last year David Baer, a research physiologist at 
the Human Nutrition Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland, found that  almonds have 32per cent fewer calories than previously estimated.

According to the Atwater system a 28 gram serving of almonds has about 170 calories, 
but Mr Baer found the energy content of the nuts was around 129 
calories.

He explained: 'If we're going to put the information out there on the food label, it would be nice that it's accurate.'

Nutritionist Susan Roberts found that soups, salads and sides at restaurants were the worst offenders when it came to items that contained more calories than stated.

'We aren't getting a good 
perspective when it comes to making dietary choices'

Shockingly the Outback Steakhouse claimed their classic blue cheese wedge side salad had 376 calories, but lab results showed it had a gut-busting 1,035.

And a separate study by the Today show last summer found that so-called low-calorie ice creams and frozen yoghurts can contain as much as 68per cent more calories than the labels claim.

Ms Roberts said: 'It's really the low-calorie foods that matter more. If you're buying a thousand calorie item, you're probably not counting calories. If you're buying a low-calorie diet item, you don't want it to be off.'

Many calorie counts also don't account for the fact that some calories in food are lost as heat. The amount of heat we expend depends on the
components of the food.

For proteins, it's about 20 to 30per cent of the
 food's calories - so 100 calories of protein would provide around 80 calories - while for fats it's about
 0 to 3per cent - meaning 100 calories worth of fat would equal 97 calories.

While many researchers are pushing for improvements to be made to the Atwater system some say that on the 
whole, the inaccuracies do not make a big 
difference.

Malden 
Nesheim, professor of nutrition emeritus at Cornell University and co-author of the book Why Calories Count added: 'For most uses, I think they're good enough.'
