A pet Jack Russell terrier is set to be given an award after saving her owner's life during a late night house fire by licking her face.

Barbie the dog alerted her owner Rosemary Field, 72, to the blaze as she slept at her Bristol home.

The pensioner initially shooed her beloved pet away but the determined puppy didn't give up and eventually stirred Ms Field from her sleep.

Partially-sighted Mrs Field realised her bed was ablaze after a lit bedside lamp toppled onto the bed, burned through a quilt and several sheets and blankets before causing the mattress to catch fire.

The woman first tackled the fire with a jug of water before calling emergency services to her home.

Fire crews who arrived told the pensioner the blaze would probably have been fatal but for Barbie’s brave actions.

Relieved owner Ms Field said: 'I can't do enough for little Barbie now – I've been giving her lots of treats since it happened.

'She usually sleeps on my bed but when she started licking my face so early in the morning I was quite annoyed.

'It wasn't until I woke up more that I saw the bottom of my bed was on fire.

'I tried to put it out but there was a lot of smoke.

'My main worry was to get all my animals out but the cat wouldn't come.

'Luckily the fire was out by the time the firefighters got here and everyone was OK.

'They told me it was very lucky that Barbie had woken me up, or I might have slept through it and died.'They said I shouldn't use the lamp anymore – I put it outside by my front door but someone has stolen it!

'I would like to warn them not to use it.'

Today the RSPCA announced it would present an award to Barbie and her owner to recognise the dog’s bravery and persistence.

RSPCA Bristol and district branch manager Eddie Grinham said: 'I was touched by how alert Barbie was to the danger her owner was in.

'It is an incredible story of the 
strong bond between a dog and its owner - sensing danger this little dog
did not run away but overcame her own fear to persist in trying to get 
her owner to come with her.

'I believe Barbie should be rewarded for her actions.'
