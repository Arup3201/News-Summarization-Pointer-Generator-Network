More than 1,600 crimes are being committed across England and Wales every single week by criminals who have been released from prison after serving short-term sentences.

New figures released by the Ministry of Justice reveal how an average of 10 burglaries were committed every day in one year by newly-freed prisoners.

The fresh data shows how offenders who were jailed for less than a year in 2011 went on to commit a total of 84,598 crimes in the 12 months following their release.

It included 3,873 domestic and commercial burglaries, 31,100 thefts, 625 robberies, 505 sex crimes, 4,643 drugs offences and 11,344 violent offences – the equivalent of 30 every day.

Ministers said the research showed the danger of releasing criminals without proper supervision.

From next year, criminals jailed for less than a year will be monitored in the community by charities, voluntary organisations and private firms.

Some 21 new community rehabilitation companies have been formed to deal with medium and low-risk offenders while a new National Probation Service will be tasked with protecting the public from the most high-risk offenders.

Currently, the probation service only keeps tables on those sentenced to a year or longer.

Justice minister Jeremy Wright said: ‘These figures again bear out the urgent need for reform - too many criminals are walking the streets unsupervised and returning to crime, and honest, hard-working people are paying too high a price for that.’

It came as a report by the Prison Reform Trust claimed government spending cuts had left the prison service creaking under ‘unprecedented strain’.

The study found two-thirds of prisons are overcrowded, holding two inmates in cells designed for one.

It warned that reductions in staffing levels impact on safety and the amount of time prisoners are able to spend engaged in purposeful activity.

A total of 1,575 serious assaults took place in prisons last year, the highest number for a decade and a rise of more than 300 over the previous 12 months.

The report also revealed that, at the end of March this year, there were 10,649 foreign nationals behind bars, 12 per cent of the overall population.

They come from 159 countries, with over half from Poland, Ireland, Jamaica, Romania, Pakistan, Lithuania, Nigeria, Somalia, India and Albania.

Prison numbers soared by more than 500 in the two weeks between May 9 and May 23, compared to an overall increase of 1,496 in a whole year between March 2013 and March 2014.

Last month it emerged that prisoners are set to lose their automatic right to day release following a series of serious crimes committed by offenders temporarily out of jail, including murder, robbery and drug smuggling.

Under the new rules, inmates will be allowed out only for a specific purpose, such as work experience, and prisoners on day release will have to wear tags.

They will also have to earn the privilege of day release through good behaviour and demonstrating a commitment to change - rather than automatically qualifying as they have previously.
