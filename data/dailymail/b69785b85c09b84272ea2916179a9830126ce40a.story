Nebraska's highest court threw out on Friday a suit challenging the proposed pathway of the Keystone XL pipeline, putting the decision to approve or deny a permit to build the conduit squarely on the shoulders of President Barack Obama and his administration.

The State Department and the White House had used the outstanding court case as cover to indefinitely block new construction on the transnational oil transportation system owned by company TransCanada.

With the legal matter resolved, President Obama must decide once and for all whether to allow TransCanada to proceed as planned on building the XL portion of the pipeline.

President Barack Obama is pictured here today leaving the White House. A Nebraska court threw out this morning a lawsuit challenging the proposed route of the Keystone XL pipeline, putting the decision squarely on the Obama administration's shoulders

President Obama met on Wednesday with Secretary of State John Kerry, left, Vice President Joe Biden, center left, and National Security Adviser Susan Rice, right, in the Oval Office. It is now up to Kerry's State Department to decide whether pipeline construction can proceed or to the White House to sign congressional legislation giving the project the green light

If given the go ahead by the U.S. government, the XL portion of the pipeline would travel from Hardisty, Canada to Steele City, Nebraska, by way of Montana and South Dakota.

From there it extends down to the United States' southern border, splitting off in Texas to come to a head in Houston and Port Arthur, Louisiana.

Obama has already said he would veto bipartisan legislation poised to pass in Congress giving the XL portion of the project the green light.

However that veto threat was partly predicated on the uncertain route of the pipeline and the White House wouldn't commit this week to issuing a blanket rejection of Keystone.

'Once that is resolved, that should speed the completion of the evaluation of that project,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Tuesday.

A spokesman for the president confirmed on Friday, though, that the president's position remains unchanged.

'Regardless of the Nebraska ruling today, the House bill still conflicts with longstanding Executive branch procedures…and if presented to the president, he will veto the bill,' Obama spokesman Eric Schultz said today, per The Hill.

The president appeared skeptical at a press conference last month of Keystone backers' claims that a new segment of pipeline would lead to a significant drop in gas prices and large scale job creation. 

'It’s very good for Canadian oil companies and it’s good for the Canadian oil industry. But it’s not going to be a huge benefit to U.S consumers. It’s not even going to be a nominal benefit to U.S. consumers,' Obama told reporters.

'I’ve just tried to give this perspective because I think there’s been this tendency to really hype this thing as some magic formula to what ails the U.S. economy, and it’s hard to see on paper where they’re getting their information from,' he said. 

Obama is also uneasy about the amount of carbon pollution the pipeline would indirectly bring about, the White House has said.

'As we see weather disasters worsen, as we see in the form of wildfires or more severe hurricanes, that only adds to costs. So the President does harbor those concerns,' Earnest said earlier this week.

Another factor in the White House's decision to wave off Congress' attempts to fast track Keystone is that 'there’s already a well-established process in place to consider whether or not infrastructure projects like this are in the best interest of the country.

'In previous administrations when pipeline projects like this were considered they were evaluated by the State Department and other experts in the administration to reach a determination about whether or not that project was in the national interest,' Earnest said earlier this week. 

The White House said today that it would wait for State to finish its review before Obama comes to his own conclusion. 

'The president believes the process should unfold at the State Department,' Schultz told reporters traveling with Obama today on his trip to Tennessee.

The State Department has been reviewing Keystone since 2008. 

In 2012 President Obama rejected the initial route put forward for the XL pipeline and sent TransCanada back to the drawing board. 

Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman OK'd those plans the following January but a legal challenge put pipeline construction in limbo for the last two years.

At the beginning of 2014, the State Department issued an environmental impact study that concluded that the pipeline would have minimal effects on carbon pollution. 

It also found that even if the pipeline were permanently shutdown, the crude oil it carries would most likely be transported through other means, then burned, and the same carbon emissions would eventually end up in the atmosphere one way or another.

State was in the middle of conducting a 90-day review period, in which other government agencies could weigh in on the department's report, when it suddenly put a halt to the procedure, citing the legal battle in Nebraska.

'The Nebraska Supreme Court decision could lead to changes in the pipeline route, and it’s important to have that information and better understand that route, because it could have implications for environmental, socioeconomic and cultural impacts of the pipeline,' a State Department official told reporters during an April conference call, according to the New York Times.

It was the second time the federal agency had delayed the process, having postponed a decision in 2011 until after the next year's elections. It attributed that hold up to the dispute over the route as well.

West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin,  a Democratic sponsor of the long-stalled Keystone XL pipeline bill, flanked by Minnesota Sen. Al Franken to his right, makes his plea at the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee markup on the controversial project on Thursday. With Manchin's help, Senate Republicans may be able to rally enough of their colleagues across the aisle to overturn a presidential veto

The government agency must now move forward with its review and Secretary of State John Kerry, and ultimately, the president, must determine whether or not to side with environmentalists, who strongly oppose Keystone, and Democrats on Capitol Hill begging him to allow construction on the final portion of the pipeline to begin. 

Congress has tried to needle the president for months to give his blessing to Keystone. A dozen Senate Democrats wrote to Obama last year warning that if his administration didn't speed up its review they would be left with little choice but to intervene legislatively.

Last month a bill approving Keystone died in the upper chamber after it fell a single vote short of overcoming a procedural hurdle. 

The lead sponsors of the bill, North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, a Republican, and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, now say they have the 60 votes needed to advance the legislation. 

And while they still have more lobbying to do, the pair believes they may be able to persuade enough Democrats to support the bill to cancel out a presidential veto. The Senate is expected to take a preliminary head count on the measure on Monday and will likely take a final vote early next week.

The House approved Keystone on a vote of 266-153 this afternoon, attracting the support of 28 Democratic members, more than twice as many as voted for it in December.

But nearly four dozen Democrats would have to sign onto the legislation to defy Obama's promised veto. 

Capitol Hill Republicans attempted on Friday to pressure Obama to change his mind, with members demanding that he stop making 'excuses.'

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Nebraska decision provides the 'perfect opportunity' for Obama to 'reverse his veto threat.'

House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement that he president 'is now out of excuses for blocking the Keystone pipeline and the thousands of American jobs it would create.'

'Finally, it’s time to start building,' the GOP leader said.

Newly minted Senate Energy Chair Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said Obama's 'had six years to approve a project that will increase U.S. energy supplies and create closer ties with our nearest ally and neighbor, and he’s refused to act.

'Regardless of whatever new excuse he may come up with, Congress is moving forward,' she said.

For their part, progressive groups hammered Republicans today over the zeal with which they have pursued Keystone legislation and again urged Obama to reject TransCanada's permit.

'The eleventh vote by House Republicans to force approval really begs the question: Why are Republicans so obsessed with Keystone XL?' Elijah Zarlin, senior campaigner at CREDO, said in statement this afternoon.

'It's not about gas prices or jobs, it primarily benefits Canadian oil companies at the cost of American land, water, and scorching our climate,' he claimed.

'The Republicans work for the American people, not Canadian oil companies. It's time they start acting like it and drop their obsessive Keystone XL fetish.'

Danielle Droitsch, Canada Project director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said today's ruling clears the way for Obama - and only Obama - to decide whether the 'dirty tar sands pipeline is in the national interest.'

'The ruling doesn’t make it right for the Congress to act as a permitting agency, usurp presidential authority or short-circuit the president’s obligation to decide whether the pipeline is good for the country,' she said.

'It’s not. It needs to be denied.'
