A Colombian mayor is asking or a plaque to be removed just a week after it was unveiled by Prince Charles following attacks by locals.

Prince Charles unveiled the memorial, which commemorates the lives of British soldiers who died trying to take the city from the Spanish in 1741, in Cartagena on Friday.

But the city's mayor, Dionisio Velez, is now calling for it to be taken down after 'very negative reactions' from locals.  

Attacked: The mayor of Cartagena, Colombia, has demanded that a plaque commemorating the lives of British soldiers killed attacking the port be removed less than a week after it was unveiled by Prince Charles

The British Navy attacked the wealthy trading port in 1741 in an attempt to assert dominance over the Caribbean region. The attack ended in a crushing defeat, with 18,000 British troops killed

The city's police force say one man has already been arrested while trying to damage it. 

The mayor said he did not want to 'hurt the feelings of people' and 'a mayor has to avoid errors, but when it’s clear he has made one, he is obliged to rectify it', according to the BBC.

Juan Carlos Gossain, governor of the state which covers Cartagena, added: 'Why isn’t there a tribute in London to the Nazi pilots who died while bombing the city during World War Two?'

In the 18th century the port at Cartagena was one of the four main Spanish trading posts  in the Caribbean, funneling large amounts of gold and silver from South America back to Europe.  

The British attack, under the command of Vice-Admiral Edward Vernon, ended with the deaths of around 18,000 British soldiers, while only 2,000 Spanish troops lost their lives.

The Spanish commander, Don Blas de Lezo, was hailed as a hero and a statue of him was erected at the San Felipe de Barajas castle - close to where the new plaque has been placed.

 Hatred: Colombian police say they have already arrested one man who was caught trying to damage it

The plaque was unveiled on Friday by the Prince of Wales and recalls the 'valour and suffering of all those who died in combat whilst seeking to take the city' from the Spanish crown. 

Charles left Colombia on Sunday for Mexico as part of a Royal tour of South America with his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall.

Camilla was left blushing for all the wrong reasons today when she turned up in a stunning creme ensemble - which was almost identical to her host's outfit.

Standing beside Gretta Salinas de Medina, the First Lady of Monterrey, the pair looked the mirror image of one another, as they made their way around the industrial city in northern Mexico.

The outfit faux pas took place on the final day of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall's trip.

In the mid-18th century, Cartagena was one of four large, heavily defended Spanish ports which dominated the lucrative trade routes through the hotly contested Caribbean.

Comprising around 10,000 people, it was founded by the Spanish in 1533 and passed through British and French hands before landing back in Spanish control.

In the 1700s, it was one of the main routes which saw hoards of South American gold and silver pass through on its way back to Europe.

British and Spanish relations in this period were tense, and a series of trading treaties were established in colonial waters in an attempt to prevent conflict.

As part of one such treaty, the 1729 Treaty of Seville, the Spanish were allowed to board Royal Navy ships sailing through Spanish waters.

During one boarding, a British captain named Robert Jenkins had his ear cut off by a Spanish officer. He pickled the ear, took it back to in London, and presented it to the House of Commons.

 

That lead to Prime Minister Robert Walpole declaring war on the Spanish in 1738, a conflict which would become known as the War of Jenkins' Ear.

The British attack on Cartagena came in 1741 (pictured above). After a series of minor victories around the Caribbean, this assault was aimed at permanently weakening the Spanish dominance over the region.

The attack, under the command of Vice-Admiral Edward Vernon, was among the largest ever mounted by the Royal Navy, and ended in a crushing defeat.

Vernon lost 37 ships, including transports, and another 17 were heavily damaged. Around 11,000 men lost their lives fighting, with another 7,000 subsequently died of disease.

By comparison, the heavily fortified Spanish lost just 800 men, with another 1,200 perishing from infections afterwards.

Admiral Don Blas de Lezo was hailed as a hero by locals, and secured the Spanish foothold in the Caribbean for the next century.

A statue of de Lezo was erected near the Castillo San Felipe de Bara which had been heavily involved in the fighting.
