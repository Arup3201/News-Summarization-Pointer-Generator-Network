An active and healthy 17-year-old teen suddenly struck with the flu died just six days after he started feeling sick and his heartbroken mother is speaking out to plead with parents to take every precaution to get their children vaccinated against the flu.

The Colorado teen, Austin Booth, was just one of 115 children in the U.S. who died during the last flu season and frightening new research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released on Thursday reveals the increasing rates of flu deaths among otherwise healthy young patients.

Given Austin's vibrant lifestyle before he died in January 2011, his parents didn't think he needed a flu shot but they are now joining with health officials to warn parents that no matter how healthy a child is, the deadly disease can strike without warning.

The strapping teen, whose family had just moved from Dallas, Texas to Rifle, Colorado, was a committed student and athlete and proud big brother to his four younger siblings.

On January 12, 2011, Austin started to feel weak but even though he didn't feel well, he wanted to forge ahead and go to school and attend practice for the high school varsity basketball team.

'He was one of those kids that everybody liked instantly. He played varsity football and varsity baseball and basketball,' his mom, Regina Booth, told NBC News.

'It was very, very rare that he would be sick or stay home for anything,' his mom, 42, said.

'When he got sick still the first day, he didn’t feel good. We knew it was flu season. A couple of other kids on the basketball team had come down with flu so we knew that was going on.'

But just a day after he started to feel unwell, he started coughing up blood and was rushed to the emergency room.

Tragedy: The popular teenager was rushed to the hospital in early January 2011 when he started coughing up blood. He was given numerous antibiotics but his organs couldn't fight the infection

The boy was airlifted to a larger 
nearby hospital in Grand Junction, Colorado and was diagnosed with 
influenza B and an infection called methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA.)

He was placed into a medically induced coma and was put on a ventilator to help with his breathing.

Even with a massive dosage of antibiotics, the infection 'was more than he could do. His organs started to shut down.'

He died on January 17, less than a week after he started to feel sick.

'If I would have taken him to the 
doctor sooner they would have said he has the flu and sent him home,' 
his grieving mother said.

'Nothing would have changed. The only think I look back at now - I wish we would have gotten the flu shot that year.'

According to the CDC, 43 per cent of children in the U.S. who died from 
the flu were healthy and had no conditions that would make them 
high-risk.

The new research, unveiled at a 
conference for infectious disease specialists in San Diego, shows that 
healthier children actually died more quickly from the disease compared 
to children with high-risk conditions like asthma, Down 
syndrome or cerebral palsy.

Among
healthy patients who died, they passed away an average of four days 
after the illness hit whereas children with conditions that would make 
them high risk, on average, succumbed after seven days.

Though
flu shots are recommended for anyone over the age of six months, 
only 51.5 per cent of children (aged six months to 17 years) were 
vaccinated in 2011.

CDC’s Dr Karen Wong led the research team to review influenza related deaths between 2004 and 2012.

'Of the 781 with a known medical history, 333 (43 per cent) had no high-risk conditions; of children with high-risk conditions, 57 per cent had neurologic disorders, 45 per cent had asthma or other pulmonary disease, and 22 per cent had genetic or chromosomal disorders,' according to their findings.

She told NBC that getting a flu shot should be a top priority for parents.

'Because the study did find a lot of otherwise healthy kids who did have influenza-associated deaths and because we know deaths can happen fast, prevention is best, and the best prevention is the vaccine,' she said.

And now the Booth family is speaking 
out to encourage families to heed that advice and take every precaution 
for the sake of their children.

Regina Booth is now a flu vaccine advocate for Families Fighting Flu, a volunteer based advocacy group supporting families who have lost a child to influenza.

'I was one of those people who didn’t think they needed it,' Booth, who is pregnant and set to give birth in December, said.

'I was one of those people who thought if you get the shot, you are going to get sick.'

'The only think I look back at now - I wish 
we would have gotten the flu shot that year.'

But now her four children, aged 16, 12, 7 and 3, have all gotten flu shots and she is encouraging parents to follow suit.

High risk: Data on the fatalities from past flu seasons shows that children without underlying medical conditions were equally at risk to die from the disease

Young victims: The greatest number of deaths, among children, from the disease during the last flu season occurred in patients aged 5 to 11
