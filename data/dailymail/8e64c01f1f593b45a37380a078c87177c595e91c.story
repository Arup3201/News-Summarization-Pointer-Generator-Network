Health fears: Michael Jackson's former doctor Conrad Murray was rushed to hospital over fears he could suffer blood clots

The doctor jailed for the involuntary manslaughter of Michael Jackson has been rushed to hospital over fears he could suffer fatal blood clots in his legs because of the cramped conditions of his prison cell.

Conrad Murray, 59, who is serving a four-year sentence at Los Angeles County Jail, claims that living in a 5ft by 7ft cell is slowly 'killing him'.

Murray, who stands 6ft 5ins tall, is housed in a segregation block away from the prison's general population over fears he could be attacked.

According to his lawyers he is allowed two hours exercise in a rooftop 'cage' every Monday.

His lawyer Michael Flanagan told the New York Daily News: 'He’s being housed like a piece of veal.

'He can't even do jumping jacks in his cell. The bed takes up three feet, and there's a toilet in there too. It's awful what they're doing to him.'

Mr Flanagan has sent a letter to Los Angeles County jail officials claiming Murray is suffering slow blood flow in his lower extremities as well as right shoulder pain and a general loss of mobility.

The letter state that the symptoms put him at high risk of deep vein thrombosis, which could lead to permanent damage or even death.

The letter adds: 'Death or injury at the hands of another prisoner … is no worse than a slow death caused by a loss of circulation and atrophy resulting from inhumane confinement of a large man in a tiny space.'

Sheriff's department spokesman Nicole Nishida denied his life was in any danger claiming Murray was housed in a standard-sized cell used for inmates who are even larger than he is.

Court

She said:'He's not dying in jail. People over at the jail did speak with him today, and he's alive and receiving proper medical treatment.

'He's receiving really good treatment in fact. He has some issues and concerns, and we're working with him.'

'We do understand he has concerns, and we are listening to him,' she said.

Bur Mr Flanagan insists the doctor's health has deteriorated sharply over the past year and that he is in real danger.

He added: 'Anybody who watched the 
(involuntary manslaughter) trial that ended almost a year ago, they 
wouldn't recognize him walking on the street today.

Conrad Murray was sentenced to four years after being found guilty of involuntary 
manslaughter over the death of pop star Michael Jackson. His lawyers claim his health has deteriorated sharply in prison

'His hair has turned gray. He's down 20 or 30 pounds. He's very gaunt-looking and has a hard time walking.'

Although
the letter does not make any specific demands about where exactly 
Murray should be moved, one option, according to Mr Flanagan, would be 
is monitored home confinement.

'If
you put your puppy in the box you take to the vet and then left him in 
that box for a year or two years, what kind of condition would he be 
in?' Mr Flanagan added. 'What kind of animal are you going to have 
coming out of there?'
