A homeowner has had £20,000 wiped off 
the value of his house – because a surveyor said it was threatened by 
knotweed growing behind his back yard.

Father-of-one Ben Metcalfe, 35, had 
put his terrace home in Stockport on the market at £100,000 and, after 
two years of waiting, thought he had a buyer.

But the sale fell through at the last 
moment when a surveyor carried out an inspection on behalf of the 
prospective purchaser. His report found the house was worth only £80,000
because of a cluster of aggressive Japanese knotweed growing on council
land next door.

The sale of Mr Metcalfe's house fell through at the last minute after a surveyor who carried out a report for a prospective purchaser said it was only worth £80,000 - not £100,000 - because the aggressive weed was growing on council land in an alleyway. The bamboo-like weed looms menacingly over the wall to the right

The expert said the weed was a threat 
to the foundations of neighbouring properties and recommended a 
‘migration plan’ to establish where the roots were, how fast the weed 
was growing and what direction it would grow in.

The bamboo-like plant can grow up to 
12ft high, push through concrete and damage buildings. Eradicating it 
with pesticides costs £100 per square foot.

An embankment behind Mr Metcalfe’s home is riddled with the weed, some of it already 10ft high.

Mr Metcalfe, an NHS support worker, and other locals have long complained about the danger the weed poses to nearby foundations.

He is unable to cut back the weed himself for fear he could be prosecuted for damaging property.

He said: ‘We had fallen in love with a house and put an offer in but our sale fell through and we were left stranded.

‘We had been planning to move for two or three years. It is unbelievably frustrating.

‘It is clearly a real problem when someone can’t get a mortgage because of weeds.

After contacting the local council property management company, NPS, it has agreed to treat the knotweed - for the first time in two years - and will give Mr Metcalfe a certificate guaranteeing it will be kept in check for five years

‘I was told that if it didn’t get sorted out then I would have to sell at auction, or find a cash buyer.

‘There are a lot of lenders that simply won’t offer a mortgage on a home that has knotweed nearby.

‘When the survey came back, not only 
did it show up the knotweed, it said that for the sale to proceed there 
would have to be a full “migration plan” put together to chart where the
plant was and how it was travelling.

‘Of course the buyer got cold feet. We
feel like we were left completely stuck in this position while we wait 
for the knotweed to be treated. We just have to hope that we can find a 
buyer that is open minded.’

After contacting the local council, 
property management company NPS has agreed to treat the knotweed – for 
the first time in two years – and will give Mr Metcalfe a certificate 
guaranteeing it will be kept in check for five years.

Local Labour councillor Philip 
Harding, who raised the case with Stockport Council, said: ‘It has been a
problem there for ten years so I don’t know why it has taken so long to
deal with properly.’

Liberal Democrat councillor Mark Weldon, executive member for community services, attempted to reassure residents.

‘We are committed to tackling this issue and have a comprehensive policy to address Japanese knotweed,’ he said.

‘We are aware of the residents’ concerns and contact has been made with them.

‘This site was treated for Japanese knotweed a couple of years ago when it was brought to our attention.

‘There has recently been some re-growth which will be revisited.’

The curse of Japanese knotweed

Japanese knotweed – which has the scientific name fallopia japonica – was introduced into Britain by the Victorians in 1840.

Incredibly
invasive, it can grow 4in a day from April to October and a tiny root 
can establish itself as a plant in  just ten days.

Apparently
solid structures such as tarmac and flooring in houses are no barrier 
to its growth and the weed also creates a risk of flooding if leaves 
clog waterways.

About £1.6billion is spent a year in an attempt to remove it.

Knotweed is recognised by its shovel-shaped leaves, bamboo-like stem and white flowers produced in autumn.

If you discover the plant on your property, these are some of the steps you should take to prevent further problems:
