Police have released images of a man they would like to speak to in connection with the theft of a bike at the RideLondon FreeCycle event

A suspected bike thief is being hunted by police after he was pictured taking part in a huge cycling event on a stolen bicycle by an official race photographer.

The bike's owner found the images posted online by official photographers of the RideLondon FreeCycle event after his bicycle was stolen ahead of the race starting.

The green Trek Madone 4.9, worth up to Â£3,000, had been securely locked up at Green Park, near Constitution Hill, central London, before the event.

But when the 42-year-old owner returned to the area before the race, at 1pm on Saturday, August 3, he discovered the lock had been cut and the bike was missing.

Police have said an official RideLondon photographer captured images of the stolen bike, complete with race numbers still attached, being ridden along the Mall.

The bike's owner discovered the images posted online and handed them to police.

Officers from the joint Transport for London and Metropolitan Police Service Safer Transport Command Cycle Task Force are now trying to trace the man in the photograph.

PC Charlotte Brierley, of the Cycle Task Force, said: 'The victim was about to take part in the FreeCycle event when his bicycle was stolen.

'The theft took place in the middle of a very busy event and we are urging people who were there who may have seen anything to come forward.

'As a result he could not take part in the event which he was looking forward to participating in.'

The suspect is a white man wearing a blue cycle helmet, sunglasses, a blue and white striped t-shirt, beige or grey shorts and blue and white shoes.

About 50,000 cyclists took to the streets of London to take part in the mass participation event which featured a number of races taking in some of the capital's iconic landmarks.

Anyone with information is urged to contact PC Brierley who is leading the investigation for the Cycle Task Force on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
