Honeymoon bride Kristy Cadman-Jones died as a result of an accidental drugs overdose, Cambodian police insisted yesterday.

Speaking yesterday to The Mail on Sunday, a senior Cambodian police officer described seeing at least three syringes along with a half-drunk bottle of whiskey beside the bed where the recruitment agency branch manager lay dead.

At an inquest in Leicester last week a coroner pointed out alleged inconsistencies in statements made by Mrs Cadman-Jones’s husband Damian after his 27-year-old wife was found dead in a hotel room in Phnom Penh on January 9.

But the officer said solicitor Mr 
Cadman-Jones, 31, was ‘completely distraught’ and told police he went to
sleep with his wife in his arms and woke to find her cold and dead at 
dawn.

Hotel waiter Peany Ritay, 24, also said the couple ‘looked very much in love’ in the days before her death.

The officer confirmed that Mr 
Cadman-Jones was not tested for drugs or asked about the used syringes 
but said the case was now closed.

A coroner recorded an open verdict into the death of the recruitment consultant, who died in her sleep

Mr Cadman-Jones first realised there was something wrong with his wife when he woke a few hours later to find her unresponsive

Mr Cadman-Jones tried waking his wife by shaking and shouting her, throwing water in her face, before beginning CPR and calling for an ambulance

At the inquest, coroner Donald 
Coutts-Wood asked Mr Cadman-Jones: ‘Were you in any way involved with 
others in any intention to end your wife’s life?’ He denied this.

Although he did not mention drugs to 
police in Cambodia, Mr Cadman-Jones told the inquest he believed his 
wife might have taken pure heroin thinking it to be cocaine supplied by 
two travellers.

The coroner recorded an open verdict.
