An aid package worth $50.5 billion has been approved for victims Superstorm Sandy after weeks of political wrangling.

The House of Representatives approved the disaster relief for those devastated by the storm in a 241-180 vote.

The Senate is expected to accept the measure early next week and send it to President Barack Obama, despite some Democratic concerns that the package does not do enough.

Recovery: The Senate is expected to accept the measure but there have been concerns that the package does not do enough

Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said: 'While the House bill is not quite as good as the Senate bill, it is certainly close enough.'

The aid package was supported by House democrats in large numbers in the vote, but substantial Republican backing was needed before its passage in the Republican-controlled House.

The victory has been tarnished by some who have complained that Congress approved tens of billions of dollars in aid within days of Hurricane Katrina but stalled for more than two months on Sandy aid.

Sandy pounded several states in late October and has been blamed for 140 deaths and billions of dollars in residential and business property damage.

New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were hardest hit, with power outages and interruptions to public transportation causing the clamor for federal relief to begin almost immediately.

Republican Rep. Peter King called the package an 'outstanding victory for the people of New York, New Jersey and Long Island'.

Immediate: Obama previously called for House Republicans to vote on the Sandy aid 'without delay for our fellow Americans'

But he added that 'it is unfortunate that we had to fight so hard to be treated the same as every other state has been treated'.

House Democrats resisted most attempts by southern conservatives to reduce the measure or offset part of its cost through spending cuts elsewhere in the budget.

Critics said the proposed cuts would crimp Pentagon spending as well as domestic accounts.

Conservatives did succeed in stripping $150 million for Regional Ocean Partnership Grants and $9.8 million for rebuilding seawalls and buildings on uninhabited islands in the Steward McKinney National Wildlife refuge in Connecticut.

The House measure includes about $16 billion to repair transit systems in New York and New Jersey and a similar amount for housing and other needs in the affected area.

An additional $5.4 billion will go to the Federal Emergency and Management Agency for disaster relief, and $2 billion is ticketed for restoration of highways damaged or destroyed in the storm.

The Senate approved a $60.4 billion measure in the final days of the Congress that expired on January 3 and a House vote had been expected quickly.

But House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner unexpectedly postponed the vote in the final hours of the expiring Congress as he struggled to calm politicians unhappy that the House had just approved a separate measure raising tax rates on the wealthy.

Boehner's delay sparked a public uproar, much of it from other Republicans like New Jersey Governor Chris Christie who has lobbied Congress for aid.

'There's only one group to blame for the continued suffering of these innocent victims, the House majority and their speaker, John Boehner,' Mr Christie said on the day after the delay was announced.

The Republican leadership brought legislation to the floor two weeks later under ground rules designed to satisfy as many Republicans as possible, while retaining support from Democrats eager to approve as much in disaster aid as possible.

Congress has already approved a $9.7 billion increase in a fund to pay federal flood insurance claims, much of it expected to benefit victims of Sandy.

The House-passed Sandy aid package does not include some projects that were in the Senate version and drew sharp fire from conservatives as unrelated to the storm.

Not included in the House bill were a provision for $150 million for fisheries disasters that states such as Alaska and Mississippi could have shared and $188 million for an Amtrak expansion project that included new, long-planned tunnels from New Jersey to Penn Station in Manhattan.

The House version has $1.1 billion more than the Senate bill to help repair storm-damaged highways.
