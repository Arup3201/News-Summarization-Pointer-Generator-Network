David Cameron should ignore Tory backbenchers using the public ‘hysteria’ over immigration to drive Britain out of Europe, veteran MP Ken Clarke said this morning.

The former Chancellor suggested the Prime Minister should let right wing MPs defect to Ukip so the party could get back to ‘common sense’. He said: ‘We mustn’t compete with ignorance and bigotry,’

Mr Clarke’s remarks come amid growing demands for the PM to demand a cap on the number of EU migrants allowed to move to the UK.

Veteran Conservative MP Ken Clarke said David Cameron needed to 'ignore' the right wing of his party

The Prime Minister yesterday vowed to ‘fix’ Brussels’ free movement rules which give migrants the right to work anywhere in the EU.

He also hit back at European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso, who declared on a visit to London that curbs on migrants from the Continent would be 'illegal'.

Mr Barosso yesterday claimed former Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher would not have ‘surrendered to the arguments of Ukip’.

He said: "It would be impossible to hear Ukip speech coming from Margaret Thatcher, completely impossible.

‘What I remember about Margaret Thatcher, she was for enlargement and for fighting protectionism. I don't remember her defending labour market protectionism. On the contrary she was for opening markets. From what I remember of Thatcher she would not be surrendering to these arguments."

Mr Clarke this morning appeared to back the outgoing EU commission president’s remarks. He said there were ‘a section of the population that are just bigoted’.

David Cameron said the public concern over immigration was 'reasonable' and vowed to 'fix' Brussels free movement rules

European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso said Margaret Thatcher would never have 'surrendered' to Ukip arguments

He said there was ‘no point in putting some kind of arbitrary figure’ on the number of migrants coming in from Europe.

Instead, he said: ‘What we need is strong, sensible governments. We must get back to some common sense.

‘We’ve had a wave of almost hysteria. I’ve seen waves of hysteria decades ago. But in the modern world we’ve got to get used to the fact that we need an international workforce.

‘’Ignore the daft ambitions of people whose main interest is just getting Britain out of Europe.’

"Ignore those with daft ambitions, let's look after Britain in the modern world."

Speaking yesterday Mr Cameron said British voters - not the head of the European Commission - were 'the boss', insisting reform of the right to free movement would be central to demands for a looser relationship with Brussels if he wins the next election.

Senior Tories believe he will wait until after the Rochester by-election at the end of next month to set out his plans.

Nigel Farage claims the Prime Minister will not be able to place curbs on European immigration

Cabinet ministers are examining the idea of an 'emergency brake' which could be applied to limit numbers if migration exceeded forecasts.

Yesterday there were claims ministers also want to draw on current practice in Croatia, the latest country to join the EU. British workers wanting to live and work there for more than three months need a work permit, only issued with proof of accommodation, financial means of support, health insurance and a criminal background check.

Mr Cameron said: 'What we need in Britain is a renegotiation of our relationship with the European Union and a referendum where the British people decide whether to stay in this reformed organisa-tion or do we leave it.

'Now that's what I will pursue, that's what I will deliver and at the heart of that renegotiation we need to address people's concerns about immigration.

‘I'm very clear about who the boss is, about who I answer to and it is the British people. They want this, they're not being unreasonable about it. I will fix it.'

The Government has issued more national insurance numbers to workers from Spain, Romania, Greece and Italy than anywhere else over the last six years, according to official government figures

Dspite the increase in immigration, unemployment is falling. Ministers claimed this was because their 'long term economic plan' is starting to work - with more than half a millions people finding work last year

But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Mr Barroso was right to warn we would be marginalised on the world stage if Britain quits the EU.

He said: 'Do you really think people in Beijing, Washington, Tokyo are going to take Britain seriously in the future if we don't stand tall in Brussels, Berlin and Paris?

'I just think bobbing around rather hopelessly in the mid-Atlantic, and having lots of major foreign investors pulling out of this country jeopardising millions of jobs...I don't think is a way of making this country stronger and safer and more prosperous in the future.'
