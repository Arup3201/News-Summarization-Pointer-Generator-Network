Another match, another Lionel Messi record. It seems that barely a day goes by without the little master popping up and performing another record-breaking feat of some form.

And the game against Paris Saint-Germain was no different - with Messi scoring his 76th European goal, putting him level with Real Madrid legend Raul at the summit of the all-time list.

Messi had already broken Raul's Champions League scoring record in the previous round of matches, but his strike on Wednesday ensured he equalled the Spaniard in terms of goalscoring in all European competitions.

The 27-year-old Argentine has scored 75 of his 76 European goals in the premier competition of the Champions League, plus one in the Super Cup final in 2011.

He leads bitter rival Cristiano Ronaldo by one in the list of all-time European scorers, with Filippo Inzaghi next (70), followed by Gerd Muller (69).

Neymar netted Barca's second goal of the night with a sublime effort from 25 yards, before Luis Suarez snatched his maiden strike at the Nou Camp to seal a 3-1 victory.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic had put PSG ahead on his return to the Nou Camp, but Messi quickly equalised to send the Catalans on their way to victory and top spot in the group.
