John Davies: Police are still working to track down the conman

A flamboyant conman who funded an extravagant lifestyle by swindling £750,000 from struggling businesses has gone missing after being convicted of fraud.

John Davies, 53, of Milton Keynes, left a trail of misery in his wake, with 'numerous' people losing their jobs and companies as a result of his actions.

After his six-week trial police detailed how he had lived a 'flamboyant lifestyle on the back of despicable crimes', buying a house complete with the latest cinema system and a luxury kitchen.

On Wednesday, he was found guilty in his absence of 12 counts of fraud by breach of trust. Police have since issued a warrant for his arrest. 

The court case, at Aylesbury Crown Court in Buckinghamshire, related to Davies' dealings with nine different companies where he gained in excess of £750,000.

He was convicted of 11 counts by a unanimous jury decision, and one by a majority verdict.

The court was told how he had spent his ill-gotten gains on a luxury lifestyle, including more than £70,000 on a new Range Rover and foreign holidays to Barbados and Las Vegas.

Davies, of Dean Forest Way, Broughton, Milton Keynes, claimed to be an insolvency and business adviser but he was not licensed.

Between 2007 and 2013 he targeted distressed companies, claiming he could help restructure their debts.

But although he often advised companies they should go into liquidation or administration, he would delay doing so in order to gain control of companies' remaining assets which he used for his own personal gain.

The prosecution said he gained his victims' trust and then took the money that was due to the company creditors which he then spent on himself.

His swindles - carried out in Theale in Berkshire, Kent, and Northamptonshire - meant people lost their jobs, livelihoods and companies. 

Thames Valley Police Economic Crime Unit spent more than two years collating evidence against him.

Following the trial investigating officer Detective Constable Stephanie Burleigh said: 'I am very grateful to all the victims and witnesses who took the time to come to court and give statements to support the proceedings against this serial fraudster.

'Company fraud is not a victimless crime, Davies ruined many livelihoods and Thames Valley Police take these crimes seriously.

'Davies has led a flamboyant lifestyle on the back of these despicable crimes which have caused so much misery up and down the country.

'He is an accomplished and manipulative con-artist who does not care about the consequences of his actions.

'I appeal to anyone who knows where he is to contact the police immediately so that he can serve his sentence.' 

His conviction comes two years after being cleared of murdering his wife during their honeymoon to India.

Colette Davies, 39, from Bridgend, was found dead at the bottom of a 80ft ravine in a remote part of the country in February 2004.

In 2011 he was charged with murder and two counts of fraud, relating to allegations he fraudulently claimed £132,000 from a life insurance policy.

In March 2013 he was cleared of all charges at Cardiff Crown Court when the prosecution produced no evidence against him.
