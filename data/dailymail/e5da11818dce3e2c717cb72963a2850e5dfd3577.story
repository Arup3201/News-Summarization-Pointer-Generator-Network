A slim mother of four fast becoming famous for her competitive eating feats has conquered another challenge.

Molly Schuyler, 34, of Bellevue, Nebraska, bested the Mad Greek Deli Challenge Thursday in Portland, Oregon – a 12-pound sandwich, one pound of French fries and a large soda.

She completed the incredible feat in less than an hour and is the only woman to finish, KPTV reported.

Ms Schuyler had one hour to clean her plate, she needed only 54 minutes.

She ate the enormous sandwich and fries after uploading a YouTube video only three weeks ago of her demolishing nine pounds of cottage cheese in under two minutes.

‘It's an unexplained phenomenon,’ Ms Schuyler told the station. ‘I was just born that way. I started doing this about a year ago, and I guess it's like a stupid human trick.'

Halfway there: Ms Schuyler had about half of the sandwich gone in just under half an hour

She won $650 for finishing the food. When asked what the toughest part was, Ms Schuyler said the meat.

‘I don’t like salami or pepperoni,’ she said, apologizing.

Another woman who tried to win the challenge alongside her was unable to finish.

Ms Schuyler credits her childhood eating habits with helping become such a big eater.

‘We did that so much as kids, we kind of battled it out,’ she explained. ‘We've always ate big.’

Woman vs food: Ms Schuyler has eaten this sandwich - made of pork, a steak burger, brisket, cheddar, bacon, chicken and fried cheese - four times

Even more remarkable, the slim woman is in great shape, looking no worse for wear despite at times eating enough food to feed a family in mere minutes.

Another of the other feats she can boast is the Jethro's BBQ Diner challenge - a five-pound meat sandwich made of pork, chicken, bacon, brisket and deep fried cheese – four times.

She devoured the sandwich in just under eight minutes the last time she Iowa restaurant's enormous plate – ‘Man vs Food’s Adam Richman failed in his only attempt.

Ms Schuyler said she plans to use her winnings to pay for her trip back home to Nebraska.
