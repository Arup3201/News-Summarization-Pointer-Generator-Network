Shad Khan has dropped anchor again in London, but the Jacksonville Jaguars owner hopes it is his team who make a splash.

Ever the showman, the 64-year-old tycoon moored his £70million super-yacht at Tower Bridge, and will watch the Jaguars face the Dallas Cowboys at Wembley.

Playing the second of four regular season games, Khan was coy about extending the deal beyond 2016.

'I think we’re going to go through the two more years and then look at it. We are a party to a stakeholder. And whether this thing is extended the League has the final say, but it’s been great and in a couple of years we will look at it, but certainly it has worked out fabulously for the international fans. 

'And really for the Jacksonville fans, it’s been great. Last year we had 5,000 fans travel over here from Jacksonville, which is a great experience for them. It’s in their annual calendar, they get to follow the team to London.'

With the Jaguars on 1-8, their record is a meagre one. Once again, Khan played his cards close to his chest.

'I think we have the youngest team in American football, so I think we want to be getting better and better.

'The wonderful thing about the NFL is the competitive balance. I feel very good about where we’re headed, but when it comes to it on any Sunday it depends which way the ball bounces,' he said.

Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is a close friend, and paid tribute to Khan's business acumen and imagination in midweek. And Khan was keen to return the compliment.

'Jerry is one of the first guys I met... this is six, seven years ago. I was the guy off the street and Jerry Jones was the iconic American sports owner, you know, Super Bowl winner, etc. etc.

'Maybe this is a very American quality, but he was very welcoming, he showed me how the system works and so on. He’s a special guy and certainly I am very, very fond of him.'
