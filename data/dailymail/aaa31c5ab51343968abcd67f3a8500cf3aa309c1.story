A joke about the 9/11 terrorist attacks on America was cut from Jean Dujardin's new film so that he could win an Oscar, it emerged today.

The 39-year-old French star of the silent comedy The Artist scooped the Best Actor statue at the Academy Awards in Hollywood on Sunday.

But what many of the Americans voting for him did not know was that he produced and acted in a potentially devastating sketch in Les Infideles (The Players), which he is currently promoting in France.

Graphic: The French advertising authorities banned this poster of Les Infideles after complaints that it was degrading to women, but Dujardin apparently feared the deleted 9/11 scene would do most damage to his Oscar hopes.

A source close to the makers of Les Infideles confirmed that Dujardin played a cheating French businessman in one of the scenes cut out of the film, which went on show in Paris this week.

In the removed extract, the Frenchman had travelled to New York to conduct an affair, while telling his wife that he was working hard in an office in Manhattan.

As he is about to seduce his lover in a hotel room, the businessman receives a phone call from his wife and tells her: ‘Yes, yes, my darling, everything is fine!’

Meanwhile, the September 11 terrorist attacks of 2001 can be seen starting outside the window behind him, as a passenger plane flies in to the World Trade Centre. Original news footage was used in the sketch.

The source said: ‘Yes, the scene was considered too much for America. It would have been provocative, especially in the run up to the Oscars and other awards.’

Neither Dujardin, nor the official publicists of his film, were immediately available for comment.

Les Infideles has already been attacked in France for being shockingly sexist.

In a publicity photo for the film, Dujardin grips a pair of naked women's legs open, under the caption: 'I'm going into another meeting'.

Le Parisien newspaper warned before 
the Oscars that America 'doesn't joke about this kind of saucy picture' 
and The Artist could suffer 'collateral damage' from the controversy.

What is certain is that Americans never joke about September 11th 2001 - one of the darkest days in the history of the USA.

Nearly 3000 people died in the four coordinated attacks by suicide bombers on New York and Washington DC.

One of The Artist's competitors for the Best Picture Oscar - which it won - was the 9/11 drama 'Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close', which many believe had solely been nominated because it was considered a 'patriotic' film.

Controversial: Marion Cotillard faced demands that she should return her Best Actress Oscar after saying she doubted the official account of the 9/11 terrorist attacks

It is not the first time that a French Oscar winner has been involved in a 9/11 controversy following an Oscar win.

In 2008 it emerged that Marion Cotillard, who had just won Best Actress for her portrayal of Edith Piaf in La Vie en Rose, doubted the official account of the terrorist attacks.

Footage from a Paris talk show showed her questioning both the New York attacks, and the 1969 moon landing.'I think we're lied to about a number of things,' said Ms Cotillard.

Referring to the destruction of the two World Trade Centre buildings, Ms Cotillard said: 'We see other towers of the same kind being hit by planes, are they burned? There was a tower, I believe it was in Spain, which burned for 24 hours.

'It never collapsed. None of these towers collapsed. And there [New York], in a few minutes, the whole thing collapsed.'

Ms Cotillard suggested that the towers, planned in the early 1960s, were an outdated 'money sucker' which would have cost so much to modernise that it was easier to destroy them.

Her words - which she later claimed were taken out of context - led to calls for her to give her Oscar back.

Franco-American relations over diplomatic matters have been fraught in recent years, mainly because of Paris's refusal to support the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.
