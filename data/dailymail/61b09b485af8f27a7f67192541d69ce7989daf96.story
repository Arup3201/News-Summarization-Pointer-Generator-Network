Fulham boss Kit Symons hopes to keep Hugo Rodallega at the club beyond the end of the season.

The Colombian striker has emerged as a key figure in Fulham's revival under Symons, scoring eight goals so far this term, but he will be out of contract in the summer.

'You want to keep your best players and he's one of our best players and he's absolutely on fire at the moment and long may that last,' said Symons.

'Since I've been in charge Hugo's been brilliant. He's playing his football with a great big smile on his face which is the way I like the game to be played.

'So he's an obvious one to pick out but the response from everyone, I've got to say, all the players, has been excellent.'

Fulham host Watford on Friday night looking for an eighth win since Symons took over following their disastrous start to the season under Felix Magath.

The Hornets, by contrast, have lost their last four matches to slip from top spot to seventh, but Symons is still predicting a tough test.

'We're very, very confident but also we won't show any sort of complacency and we won't underestimate Watford,' added Symons at his pre-match press conference.

'They got off to a fantastic start to the season. Recent results have not been great for them but we've looked at all their games and they've played some good stuff within those games.

'They're a real threat, they've got some excellent players, so we won't be taking them lightly. But I fancy us to beat whoever we play in any game, be it home or away.'

Despite their wretched run, the Hornets are still only six points behind leaders Derby.

Head coach Slavisa Jokanovic said: 'We have not had good results over the last four games and it's our obligation to stop that run.

'This competition is long and tough with many important games in front of us, and we are still very close to the top of the table.'
