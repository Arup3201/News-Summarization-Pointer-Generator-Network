This is the moment a mysterious vision was captured on CCTV floating through a pub.

Supernatural incidents have been reported for years in the 17th century Grade II listed Allerton Hall in Liverpool.

But it was not until Monday night that the owners managed to capture 'hard evidence' of a ghostly object in the manor - which is owned by pub chain The Spirit Company.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Ghostly: This is the orb spotted drifting through the Allerton Hall in Liverpool on Monday night

The translucent object drifts through the panels of the 17th century manor moments after closing time

It was discovered by Joe McCann, general manager at the building known as The Pub In The Park, after looking back through security footage.

To his horror, the largely uneventful late-night video is interrupted by a translucent object plainly drifting across the screen.

He replayed the reel dozens of times, and every time a misty, white ball loops through the oak wood panels before drifting through a wall.

Mr McCann said: 'It was a very strange thing to see.

'We’ve all been talking about it and trying to figure out what it actually is.

'Ghost
 hunts here in the past have found some strange things like orbs and 
other supernatural activity so who knows what’s going on.

Horrified general manager Joe McCann said it is the first piece of evidence after years of reported sightings

Eventually it drifts to the right and through a wall of the Grade II listed building built in the early 1600s

'It’s a different kind of spirit to what we usually deal with anyway.

'I’m not a believer in ghosts but my girlfriend Susan was convinced she’d seen something supernatural.

'When we watched the footage back I couldn’t believe my eyes.

The manor of Allerton served as the National Fire Service headquarters during the war.

In the centuries before, it housed some of the nation's most prominent figures.

It was built in the early 1600s for the 
Lathoms, a prominent family in South Lancashire - but they were accused 
of treason after the civil war and forced to forefeit their land.

Allerton Hall, now known as The Pub In The Park, was the regional fire service based during World War Two

The city's former mayor Richard Percival took over the estate in 1670 and his family passed it down two generations.

However, in 1736, the Percivals hit financial difficulties, forcing them to sell up to soon-to-be MP John Hardman, commissioned most of the building which remains today.

When he died, Hardman handed Allerton to his butler's son: the celebrated politician, historian and philanthropist William Roscoe.

From Allerton, Roscoe wrote his book Life Of Lorenzo de Medici and influential pamphlets calling for the abolition of slavery.

His alterations to the house in 1811 involved pulling down the remaining 17th century parts and the building of a library and art space.

Mr McCann added: 'I’ll be on the lookout for any more goings on but am hoping this is a friendly ghost.'
