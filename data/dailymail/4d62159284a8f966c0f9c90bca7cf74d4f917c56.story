A Wisconsin couple are headed to trial after being accused of starving the man's 5-year-old daughter and restraining her 7-year-old sister with zipties until she passed out from a heat stroke.

Shawn Paholke, 33, and Jennifer Fendryk, 31, together face 23 felony counts of mistreating the two girls. They waived their right to a preliminary hearing in Oconto County Circuit Court Wednesday.

A criminal complaint filed in Oconto County Circuit Court says a social worker told authorities the 5-year-old appeared to be severely underweight and that ‘bones were protruding from her face and body.’

The older girl told investigators Paholke used plastic restraints to tie her hands to a pole July 4, 2012, according to the complaint.

Medical records show the 7-year-old was taken to a Green Bay hospital for treatment of ‘disfiguring’ second- and third-degree burns to her arms five days later, WLUK-TV reported.

Paholke told doctors at the time that she'd slipped and her arm got stuck on a hot deck, the complaint said.

In interviews with investigators, Mr Paholke denied tying his daughter to a pole, but acknowledged using zipties on her arms and wrists for 10 minutes as a part of a timeout.

On her part, the 7-year-old told officials that she fainted from the July heat while standing tethered to the pole, and when she came to later, she had a burn on her arm and her father was giving her a cold shower.

The younger of the two sisters told 
investigators that one time, her father got mad at her and dragged her 
on the floor, causing the 5-year-old to cut her chin, the station WBAY reported.

On another occasion, the parents allegedly grabbed a knife and threatened to cut off the child's hands. 

Fendryk is not the children's biological mother. She has an 8-year-old son from a previous relationship who was also living in the family’s Breed home, but was reportedly spared abuse.

The 5-year-old weighed only 24lbs when the investigation started in May, the complaint said, which is about half the healthy weight for a girl her age.

She also told investigators she was locked in her dark, sparsely furnished bedroom most of the time and was only allowed out by her ‘daddy’ to exercise, scrub the floor and use the bathroom.

The social worker reported the room's single window was covered with a piece of cardboard. The girl told investigators she couldn't play with her sister or Fendryk's 8-year-old son.

Paholke and Fendryk told investigators they would withhold food and send the 5-year-old to her room for disciplinary reasons, according to the criminal complaint.

'It’s not only tragic, it’s sadistic,' special prosecutor Wendy Lemkuil said in arguing against a bond reduction for Fendryk.

Fendryk's attorney, Bradley Schraven, said she will plead not guilty at arraignment scheduled for October 29. The Green Bay Gazette Press reported that she faces up to 134 years in prison if convicted.

The couple are being held in the Oconto County Jail on $250,000 bond.
