The remarkable rise of Yorkshire trainer David O’Meara continued on Sunday as Move In Time landed the Prix de l’Abbaye at 25-1.

The five-furlong sprint is always the most likely Group One race booked for export on the glittering Longchamp card but Move In Time had not looked the most likely horse to bag it.

His biggest success had come at Listed level and he spent part of this summer in handicaps. But former jump jockey O’Meara loves an upset, as he has proved in racking up more than 100 winners in a season for the second time in only his fifth season with a licence.

He said: ‘The unique nature of this track suits Move In Time. He has run three times, been beaten half a length, a head and now won.’

Moviesta, trained by Move In Time’s old handler Bryan Smart and part-owned by QPR boss Harry Redknapp, was beaten half a length having had his run hampered, although not as badly as favourite Sole Power in eighth and Pearl Secret in 14th.

Two more of the seven Group One races were won by British runners. Richard Hannon-trained Olympic Glory broke the track record in the Prix de la Foret, while James Fanshawe’s High Jinx was a neck winner of the Prix du Cadran.

His jockey Ryan Moore had earlier won the Prix Marcel Boussac on Aidan O’Brien’s Found, who now disputes favouritism for the 2015 1,000 Guineas at 5-1 with Ladbrokes.

O’Brien’s National Stakes winner Gleneagles (Joseph O’Brien) passed the post in front in the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere only to be disqualified for hanging and causing interference.
