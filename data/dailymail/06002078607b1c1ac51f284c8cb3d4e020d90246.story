A bankrupt Pakistani man and his son managed to set up a business and cheat their local community out of almost £50,000 despite being in the UK illegally, a court heard.

Siyed Asem, 58, and his son Syed Bukhari, 25, ran a corner shop and operated a Western Union money transfer service offering ‘excellent rates’ on transactions.

But more than 20 customers who used the service to send money to India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, were left thousands of pounds out of pocket.

Father and son partnership: Bankrupt Siyed Asem, left, and his son Syed Bukhari, right, together stole nearly £50,000 from their customers who had requested for the cash to be transferred to India

Jailing father and son for two years 
each, Judge Jamie Tabor QC described their offences against their own 
Asian community in Gloucester’s Barton area as ‘despicable.’

Judge
Tabor said it was ‘extraordinary’ that the men had been able to run a 
shop and set up the money transfer business when they were both illegal 
overstayers and Asem was bankrupt.

Asem
came to the UK on a visitor’s permit eight years ago and never left. 
His son was in the UK on a student permit which would not allow him to 
work or run a business.

Gloucester crown court heard that the service operated legitimately at first but the pair soon started stealing the money - which amounted to a total of £48,206.

One of their customers, retired Khadijabbi Mulla, lost £1,000 he requested to be transferred to India to pay for his operation there.

Prosecutor Lisa Hennessy said: 'He was told it would take 8 weeks, which would take him close to the date of his operation.

'When he got to India he still had not received the promised PIN number to access his money.

'He
contacted a friend in Gloucester to ask him to complain and the message
he got back was that he would get a refund when he got back.

'He has never received a refund - as he puts it he has just had lots of excuses and delays.'

Mrs Hennessy said another victim of the con, Fatima Kazi, paid the men £1,500 to be transferred to India to help fund the building of a mosque in her late father’s memory.

Mrs Hennessy continued: 'The money never arrived.'

She detailed how other customers lost money in similar transactions - Runara Begum and her husband lost almost £5,500 which was supposed to be going to Bangladesh; Rashid Salloo lost £1,000 destined for India; Yusuf Chand transferred £7,000 to India in two transactions but it never arrived.

There were other customers who had transferred significant sums and either received nothing or were given very small refunds, she added.

Mrs Hennessy said all the offences occurred within a few months between late 2010 and early 2011 after Bukhari applied in October 2010 to become an agent for Finit UK, a Western Union money transfer company.

The application was granted and he was approved after ‘various checks had been carried out’.

Mrs Hennessy told the court the fact that both men were illegal immigrants didn't appear to 'have come up on the checks'.

She added that they also failed to notice that Asem had been made bankrupt in 2008.

Fraud: The pair set up a Western Union money transfer service but stole thousands of pounds from customers that was meant to be sent to India

Bukhari admitted 11 offences of fraud - of masking false representations to customers that his money transfer business was in a sound financial position and that money would be transferred at a preferential rate of exchange - between January and March 2011.

Asem admitted 12 similar charges.

Mrs Hennessy said Bukhari was responsible for £33,688 of the total fraud and Asem £14,518.

Sabhia Pathan, defending, said Bukhari had come to Britain legitimately to study to be a chartered accountant but had started working at McDonald’s to earn some money and then had opened the shop with his father.

Asem had trusted his son’s business acumen and joined him in the venture but the money transfer service had quickly gone wrong because they were offering such good exchange rates that they made no profit, she said.

Ms Pathan said that Western Union had checked only Bukhari’s credit rating before allowing him to set up the service.

She added that both men knew they were facing deportation after their sentences and Asem was fearful of going back to Pakistan because he has health problems which are better treated here.

Despite his status he has been getting free medication, she said.

Jailing the men, Judge Tabor said: 'Over a period of three months you stole just under £50,000 from many members of your local community.

'That money was entrusted to you to transfer abroad for a variety of purposes including allowing people to have operations and to help with a mosque and other charitable tasks.

'People trusted you, especially you, father, because of the seniority that you held. I accept that when you started this business in November you ran it legitimately for a short period of time.

'But by the middle of January you were nothing more or less than confidence tricksters. You have done considerable damage to your community and you know it.

'These were despicable offences.'

He told them police will now investigate their finances to see what can be confiscated from them under the Proceeds of Crime Act.
