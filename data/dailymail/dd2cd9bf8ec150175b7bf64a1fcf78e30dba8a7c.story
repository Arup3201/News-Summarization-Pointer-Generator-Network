A grief stricken husband has forgiven the drunk driver who allegedly killed his wife, a mother of seven, as she took photos on a Florida beach two days ago.

Elizabeth Braly, 45, died when Shawn Doolan allegedly crashed through a toll booth, sped onto Daytona Beach and struck her in front of her son and daughter-in-law on Tuesday night.

But rather than condemn the intoxicated motorist, the victim's Christian husband pities him.

'He's
 got to live through it, too. And I feel bad, especially if he
 has family, too, because they're the innocent party,' Mark Braly, who celebrated his 24th wedding anniversary last week, told WFTV.

'I'm a firm believer when the good Lord calls your number, you're out of here.'

Mark Braly's compassion is all the more extraordinary because his wife was killed on the last day of a family vacation.

Blue Ridge Now reported Braly, an aspiring photographer, wanted to enjoy once more day at Daytona Beach to take pictures.

Mark Braly took the couple's youngest children back to their North Carolina home, while his wife stayed behind with her son Jonathan, 20, his wife and two of their friends.

The group, who managed to jump out of the way, watched in horror as Braly, a missionary, was mowed down.

'There was no blood on the sand at all,' Robin Braly, a sister-in-law of Braly's husband, told Blue Ridge Now. 'I don't think she ever knew what hit her.'

Mark Braly said his son Jonathan is scarred by the collision.

'The son that was with my wife when the accident occurred isn't doing well,' he told WFTV.

Another sister-in-law, Debra Braly added: 'Jonathan
 feels very guilty. He feels 
that he should have saved his mother. He said he should have been hit 
instead and he would have survived because he's younger.'

Witnesses told police appeared to be driving 60mph when he hit Braly, with another observing the motorist speeding over the Dunlawton bridge before the crash.

News of the tragic death has rocked the Bralys home town of Hendersonville, where they regularly attended church.

'It's just tragic. They're just good people, hardworking people,' David MacEachern, pastor of Bat Cave Baptist Church, said.

'My wife would say to me often, 'Mark Braly is the sweetest man I think I've ever met',' he said. 'He was always willing to help others.'

The pastor said Elizabeth Braly, a grandmother of four, was planning to join church members on a mission trip to Freeport, Pennsylvania, on July 11.

Police arrested Doolan on DUI manslaughter and DUI property damage changes. He was released from jail the next day after posted 10 percent of his $12,000 bond.
