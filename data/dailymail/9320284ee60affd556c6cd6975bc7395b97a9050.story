Huddled together in the corner of one of the world's busiest railway station, these are the abandoned children who were reunited with their mother thanks to a Twitter appeal.

The three youngsters, Rahnuma, seven, Raja, five, and four-year-old Sanya were dumped at New Delhi station by their father, who had taken them out for the day.

He told the children that their mother would come and collect them before fleeing leaving them cold, scared and hungry.

The picture was taken by local journalist Abhishek Shukla, who posted it on Twitter, asking people to help them 

However, local journalist Abhishek Shukla, 33, spotted the siblings huddling together for warm as they slept on one of the platforms, while he was seeing off his elderly parents on a train.

Concerned about their well-being, but not having time to speak to them, he took a picture and posted it to Twitter with the message: 'Can someone help these helpless kids at New Dehli Railway Station near platform 16 entrance.'

The tweet soon went viral and local police chief Madhur Verman sent his officers to the scene.

When they were eventually found on platform one, they were 'sobbing uncontrollably' and too scared and confused to tell officers how they got to the station, NDTV reported.

He said: 'When officers arrived they found the children had gone. Eventually, after an hour, they were found hiding on another platform.

Saved: After the tweet went viral, Rahnuma, Sanya, and their brother Raja, were helped by police

Police then went to the train station to rescue the children and track down their mother, who was unaware of what had happened to them 

Ms Tabassum, the children's mother, who had not been contacted by her ex husband to say where the youngsters were 

'They were cold, hungry and scared. When we arrived at the mother’s house she was asleep and said she had been working and had not been contacted by her ex husband.

'As far as she was aware the children were staying with him. We are now looking to question the man.'

Later Mr Shukla was informed that the children had been reunited with their mother and then tweeted his delight.

He wrote: 'Today morning safely handed over to mother Ms Tabassum. They are happy. (sic)'

It is estimated that there are over 11 million children in India, who are abandoned and live on the streets.

Many of them go to the country's extensive railway stations to flee to cities in the hope of finding a better life.

However, when they arrive there, they are often alone and lost and find themselves having to live on the platforms.
