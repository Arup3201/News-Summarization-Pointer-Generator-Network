An Australian couple are on the cusp of being granted access to a breakthrough medical trial which could potentially save the life of one of their two young children.

But it's a bittersweet and anxious moment awaiting Megan and her husband Allan Donnell, whom require both their three-year-old boy Jude and five-year-old daughter Isla to participate in the life-saving trial that only 15 children, worldwide, will be invited take part in.

In an interview with Channel Nine's 60 Minutes program on Sunday, the Donnell's have told reporter Michael Usher of their son and daughter's fight against Sanfilippo Syndrome and the incredibly rare misfortune of having conceived two children with the disease that affects just one in 70,000.

The Donnells are fighting to reverse a condition in their two young children which results in severe mental decline and lead to a slow and painful death

The Donnell's have revealed on the program that they are facing an uphill battle to prolong their children's longevity against the disease that, If untreated, results in severe mental decline and can lead to a slow and painful death.

'We had the perfect family, well you know we thought we did and all of a sudden they (doctors) tell you there's something wrong, it's a pretty hard thing to take,' father Allan Donnell said upon hearing their second child, Jude, was diagnosed just a month after Isla was struck down with the disease.

'It's like we won some sort of reverse lottery or something,' Mrs Donnell said.

Unknowingly, the pair were both carriers of the mutated gene which they passed onto their two children. Sanfilippo Syndrome causes developmental delay in children, usually younger than five, who have an inability to break down complex material in cells as part of the metabolism process.

With nowhere to go, the material turns toxic and from the moment the child is born it builds up in the central nervous system. And because it is classed as 'ultra rare,' very few doctors know about it and even less pharmaceutical companies - zero - are willing to fund trials in children which have proven effective on mice.

Jude provided hope for Mr and Mrs Donnell in fighting their daughter's disease, until he too was unfortunately struck down with the very same disease

The Donnell's are hoping that their two children are invited to participate in the drug trial, which begins in Ohio in December

But all that is about to change, courtesy of a band of parents including the Donnell's and an American family that have raised more than $1 million to begin trials in in young patients. The only problem is just 15 children will be granted access, meaning the Donnell's fear that they will be restricted to having one child at best participate in the trial.

'Fifteen places worldwide, we are realistic that it is unlikely that we would get two of those places,' Mrs Donnell said. 'There are lots of parents all around the world just like us with the same hope.'

Through incredible fundraising means such as online crowd sourcing, and the work of the Donnell's Sanfilippo Children's Foundation set-up to raise crucial awareness about the condition, the trial will begin in December. It's participants, as yet, are not known.

Head of biochemical genetics at Adelaide's Women's and Children's Hospital professor John Hopwood has dedicated 40 years of research to Sanfilippo Syndrome, having developed a gene replacement therapy that was successful on mice.

Mrs Donnell is hoping her son Jude and daughter Isla will be included in the trial, saying it would be a 'miracle' if they are both on it  

'If you start early in a mouse, then you can prevent the condition from developing,' Mr Hopwood said. He is hoping, that when the trials go ahead in the US later this year, it can even reverse the condition and bring children back to normal health.

'That's the big question' he said, 'but the earlier you start the better chance you've got of slowing or reversing the condition in a very significant way.'

The gene replacement therapy works by injecting a virus that delivers a healthy gene into the brain. If it works, as it did in mice, that a single injection will stop the disorder in its tracks and the children would become the first survivors of Sanfilippo Syndrome.

Dr Kevin Flanigan who is overseeing the trials in Ohio must decide which 15 children in the world will get the most benefit from the drug trial. He said without the fundraising efforts of people like the Donnell's, there would be no chance of it going ahead.

'These parents have played a key role from fundraisers in the back yard or at school bake sales and have really paved the way for the progress that we've made.'

Mrs Donnell said 'It would be a miracle' if her children were selected for the trial. 'I'm hoping that we will come back here (America), hoping that other Australian children will have the opportunity to come back here and I'm hoping work we are doing as a foundation will enable that.

'It feels so real now ... It's the only chance that we have, and we are chasing that with everything we have.'
