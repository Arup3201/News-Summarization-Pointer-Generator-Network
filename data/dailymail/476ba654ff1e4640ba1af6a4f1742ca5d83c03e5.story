The favourite in the race to become Labour’s new leader in Scotland is embroiled in a bitter row with Ed Miliband over who will take charge of the party’s Scottish campaigns.

Jim Murphy, tipped to lead Labour’s fightback against the Scottish Nationalists, has told Ed Miliband he will refuse to work with fellow Scots-born Shadow Cabinet heavyweight Douglas Alexander.

Allies of Mr Murphy say Mr Alexander is a ‘campaigns flop’ and want him to ‘stop meddling in the Labour Party in Scotland’.

Blairite Mr Murphy is a long-time political enemy of Brownite Mr Alexander, who is also Labour’s foreign affairs spokesman.

Mr Alexander has been criticised over Labour’s poor performance in recent elections in Scotland and the rows that broke out in the referendum campaign. 

A senior Labour source and ally of Mr Murphy said: ‘We are clear about how we are going to get Labour back on its feet in Scotland. 

'Douglas Alexander has no part in it. Jim is his own man and has made that very clear to Ed (Miliband).’
