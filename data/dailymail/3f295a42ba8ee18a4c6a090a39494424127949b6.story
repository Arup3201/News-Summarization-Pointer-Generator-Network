Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has revealed  he will hold talks with the top brass at the club about whether to swoop for Borussia Dortmund star Marco Reus.

The German champions almost signed the 25-year-old when he joined Dortmund two years ago and would not be put off by his buy-out clause, believed to be in the region of £20million.

Bayern have signed Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski from Dortmund in the last two summers and Rummenigge has  confirmed the Bundesliga champions are weighing up whether to launch a bid for the playmaker, who is being monitored by a host of Premier League clubs, including Manchester City, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United.

The midfielder has also attracted interest from Premier League clubs including Manchester City and Arsenal

Reus is comforted by manager Jurgen Klopp  after Dortmund's 2-1 defeat against Cologne on Saturday 

'To be honest, we'll discuss the matter internally and calmly. Then we will come to a decision,' Rummenigge was quoted as saying on Goal.com.

'At the end of the day, the player has to decide too. His release clause is well known. There's nothing more to say.'

Speculation about Reus joining Pep Guardiola's team intensified after Gotze said last week that he 'would be really happy if he [Reus] would come here'.  

Bayern's interest will likely irritate Dortmund, and especially the club's chairman Hans-Joachim Watzke, who has spoken out against Bayern several times for the way they have pursued his club's key players.

Dortmund sit 14th in the Bundesliga after three consecutive league defeats.
