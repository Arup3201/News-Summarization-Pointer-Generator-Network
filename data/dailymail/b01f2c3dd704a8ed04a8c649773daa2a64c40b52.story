A dog left behind when his owners moved from their Los Angeles home has undergone a dramatic transformation after being rescued by animal welfare workers and is almost unrecognizable from the pitiful pup he was just weeks ago.

Eldad Hagar and Annie Hart of Hope for Paws were on their way back from rescuing three pit bulls when they spotted a small dog hiding under a trailer in Los Angeles rough Compton area.

The pair stopped to pick up the dog, which had long fur tangled into matted dreadlocks and was terrified of people.

Hidden: Always scanning the streets for abandoned animals, Eldad Hagar came across a dog in a pitiful state in Compton

Neglected: Little Theo ran from his would-be rescuers, terrified of people - probably due to past experiences with them

Abandoned: After Theo is finally captured, the extent of his neglect becomes clear

Neighbors told Hagar that the owners of the dog had moved a year earlier, abandoning their dog to the streets.

He had clearly not been cared for since, and his terror of people indicates at best, neglect and at worst, abuse.

In a rescue captured on camera, Hagar tries to tempt the dog, who has since been named Theo, with a hamburger but such is his terror, Theo runs from his rescuer, leading him on a chase around the neighborhood.

'Annie Hart and I jumped out of the car, and a couple of minutes later I got a leash around him (I did take a couple of bites which is pretty rare for me), but the poor guy was just so scared,' wrote Hagar in a Facebook post about Theo.

Accepting his fate: Theo allows himself to be patted in the car on the way to the shelter

Haircut: Carers had to shave off the huge knotted dreadlocks Theo's fur had become

Broken: Theo was shaking, sickly and refused to eat when he arrived at the shelter

His yelps of terror as Hagar captures him with a dog catcher's pole are heartbreaking, but as Hagar gently pats his little head, Theo's plaintive cries subside, and soon Hart is able to nurse him on her lap in the car.

Once they arrive back at Hope for Paws headquarters, the team has quite a job on their hands to groom the pup and choose to shave all of his fur off and start afresh.

The newly shorn Theo looks nothing like the mangy, dirty dog from earlier, but he hangs his head and presses his little body into the wall, his spirit still broken.

New friends: Now Theo has been taken in by a foster carer and he's become playful and care-free

All he needs is love: Theo is being cared for by a foster family, but he is still looking for a forever home

He was shaking, sickly and refused to eat.

The video cuts to Theo a few weeks later, though, when he has been taken in by a foster carer with two other dogs - and he has become a bouncing, playing, tail-wagging dog.

His two new friends - pit bull mixes a lot bigger than him - seem enamored of their new little pal and with their help, Theo seems to be coming to the understanding that his old life is over.

He's currently looking for a forever home to make his transformation into happy, beloved pet complete.
