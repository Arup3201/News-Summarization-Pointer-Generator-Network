Cheeky postcards were once part and parcel of any trip to the seaside.

But in one British tourist resort, giant-sized versions of the risque cards are stirring up controversy.

Traders in the town of Cleethorpes are calling for the larger-than-life, politically incorrect postcards to be taken down.

Nostalgic: The signs were installed for the Cleethorpes in Bloom display but now look set to be taken down

Controversy: Traders in Cleethorpes have reacted furiously to the unveiling of the postcards on the seafront

The posters had originally been put on display to welcome judges to the annual 'Cleethorpes in Bloom' floral show due to be held at the end of July.

However, shopkeepers say the nostalgic cards - stationed on council-owned land - are lowering the reputation of the seaside town.

Angry: Local shop owner, Phyllis O'Connell, pictured, says that the postcards belong in the past

Phyllis O’Connell, 47, who runs an equestrian shop, said: 'How would you explain these sort of jokes to your five year old grandchild? They are so sexist and rude.

'They have really put people’s backs up. They are bad for business and we should have been consulted before anything was put up there anyway.'

A caption on one of the postcards, showing a man ogling two girls in bikinis, reads: 'Looking at the lovely birds'.

Whilst another shows one angler saying to another 'That’s what I call a catch' as a woman walks past in a skimpy swim suit.

Shock: One shopkeeper says she wants the postcards taken down as she will find it impossible to explain them to her grandchild

Traditional? The giant-sized postcards have been defended by a spokesman for Cleethorpes in Bloom who said that one (pictured right) even promotes recycling

Mark Treacher, 38, who runs a gallery and picture framing business directly opposite the display, also said he found the postcards inappropriate: 'The one with the dog is just obscene and the rest are sexist.

'I have got an eight year old boy and don’t know how I would explain some of them to him.

'They may be 1950s postcards but I do not think they have any place at all in a family resort.

Humour: Once a staple of the British seaside, traders are now up in arms over the saucy postcards

'I would term them obscene and I must have had sixty or seventy complaints already from customers.

'A lot of children come in and out of these shops and we are trying to encourage families to come down here to enjoy the scenery and support local businesses.

'They are certainly not going to enjoy these. I would say it’s beyond a joke but there’s no joke to it as far as I can see.'

And, following the complaints, it looks as though the giant postcards - designed by a local artist based on original images - will have to be removed.

Ironically, in 1954, Cleethorpes was chosen by the Conservative government of the day to lead a crackdown on rude postcards amid concerns about declining public morals.

Local police raided seventeen shops and seized thousands of cards to prepare a case under the 1857 Obscene Publications Act against illustrator Donald McGill, who worked for Bamforth’s, the manufacturer of the postcards.

Mr McGill pleaded not guilty but was convicted at a trial at Lincoln Crown Court and fined £50 with £25 costs.

Bamforth’s appeared to have the last laugh though - going on to sell some 200 million postcards.

The company's current Managing Director Ian Wallace hit back furiously at the calls to take down the signs.

He said: 'It seems the po-faced tradition continues to this day in Cleethorpes.

'It would be really said if the placards have to be taken down. There is enough gloom and doom about at the moment.

'It is really unusual for these cards to upset anyone. Our images have been in every national paper and TV and we hardly ever get a complaint.

Conventional: A non-controversial Cleethorpes in Bloom sign put up to welcome judges for the floral competition later this month

'My message would be, to those in Cleethorpes who have complained, is to get a life and start making their visitors smile. People love this stuff and still do.'

'Cleethorpes in Bloom' Vice Chairman Jeff Blanchard insisted the postcards were merely intended as 'a bit of fun'.

He said: 'Attitudes have changed since 1954, thank goodness, so it’s a shame people have taken the wrong attitude but the last thing we want to do is offend local people.

'I can see in today’s climate it could be considered sexist but was meant as a bit of fun.

'You can still buy saucy postcards in Cleethorpes and all over the country and most people do not take offence.

'Some people think it lowers the tone of the resort and we should be promoting a more sophisticated image.

'Well, a lot of people in the resort like traditional things like funfair rides and I remember these cards from when I was a little boy.'

Two of the posters were also promoting public messages about recycling and clearing up after pets, he added.
