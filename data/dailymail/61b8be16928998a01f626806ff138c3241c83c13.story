Hull KR hooker Josh Hodgson is to leave for Canberra Raiders at the end of the season, Rovers have confirmed.

The Hull-born 24-year-old, who since joining the Robins from city rivals Hull FC in 2010 has made more than 100 appearances and earned a call-up for the second-string England Knights side, has agreed a two-year contract with the NRL club.

On the move: Hull KR hooker Josh Hodgson is set to leave for Canberra Raiders at the end of the season

Rovers chairman Neil Hudgell told www.hullkr.co.uk: 'Whilst we are disappointed to lose a player of Josh's calibre, we fully understand his reasons for wanting to test himself in the NRL.

'As you would expect from Josh, he has been honest with the club from the start of these discussions and we have secured a substantial fee from Canberra as well as agreeing first refusal on Josh if he comes back to the UK.'

Hodgson added: 'This opportunity has come at the right time for me. I've always had an ambition to play in the NRL and I felt I would have had regrets later in my career if I didn't take this opportunity.

'Hull KR took a chance on me five years ago when I first came to the club and I was grateful for that. I've always done my best to repay the faith they showed in me and it was a really tough decision to leave.'
