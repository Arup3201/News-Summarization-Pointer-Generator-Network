Mesut Ozil and Gemany were booed off in Stuttgart after an unconvincing win over Chile.

The Arsenal star was substituted in the 89th minute to a chorus of boos and the jeering continued at the full time whistle.

Mario Gotze's 16th-minute winner – set up by Ozil - was the difference between the sides but the German fans were clearly unimpressed ahead of the World Cup in the summer.

This week the German media questioned whether Ozil was the man to be national team's creative talisman.

And the fans made their feelings clear as the £42.5million signing from Real Madrid has struggled to make an impact in games in recent months.

He missed a crucial penalty for Arsenal against Bayern Munich in the Champions League and then was rested for the subsequent Premier League match against Sunderland.

Following Germany's 1-0 win over Chile, general manager Oliver Bierhoff reacted to the boos aimed in Ozil’s direction saying: 'I don't understand the whistling. I find it a shame that a player such as Mesut is picked out [for that kind of reaction]. I would hope for different support for a game like that.' 

And manager Low added: ‘We weren't 
capable of dominating the game. It is always good when one can see that 
Germany is not the only country to have good players.’

German
 captain Philipp Lahm was not too concerned about the crowd’s reaction 
to the team’s performance, he said: 'That was a lucky win. I can 
understand the jeers and whistles.

'People pay good money to watch us and it's clear that we have a lot of work to do before the World Cup. But we always prepare well for a World Cup, so I am not worried.’

And German vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger, added: 'A win's a win, Chile were really good.

'We didn't use our chances and we really have to improve but Chile are after all one of the best teams in South America.’
