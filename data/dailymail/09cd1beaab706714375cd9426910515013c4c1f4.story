They have proved to be the fashion hit of the summer, establishing themselves on the high street after being snapped up by thousands of sunseekers and  festival-goers.

Now it has been revealed that New Look has been selling 40,000 kimonos a week - helping the high street chain to a 'terrific' set of results.

With high temperatures this summer, the light and loose-fitting jackets have been flying off the shelves at clothes stores with sales boosted by the appearance of a number of celebrities dressed in the Japanese-style garment.

Former Coronation Street actress Michelle Keegan recently stepped out in a kimono from her own Lipsy Love collection.

The style has been around for a while, but it has taken off this summer, proving especially popular with holiday-makers, beach goers and festival revellers this summer.

Francesca Muston, head of retail and product analysis at the trends agency WGSN told The Guardian: 'Kimonos are very versatile, working as a spring jacket, a lightweight cover up, or, with a belt, as a dress.

'It doesn't matter what size or shape you are, you can wear it. Every now and then an item comes along that makes sense for quite a lot of people and everybody buys it.'

Fashion retailer Asos has even created a new website category for kimonos, stocking more than 40 styles, the newspaper reports.

New Look said it had capitalised on the summer's key trends, having sold 40,000 kimonos a week across its 1,100-strong store estate during the 13 week period to June 28.  

The fashion chain reported a jump in quarterly like-for-like sales of 11.6 per cent in the UK, where it has 576 stores, and a rise of 8.9 per cent across the group. 

New Look chief executive Anders Kristiansen said: 'These are terrific results which have exceeded our expectations, driven by the fact that we hit key trends effectively.' 

He added that the positive customer reaction to its ranges meant it was able to maximise full price sales. 

Operating profits for the quarter were 18.8 per cent higher at £59.4 million, while revenues rose 8.1 per cent to £392.5 million.

New Look is owned by private equity groups Apax and Permira, as well as founder Tom Singh.
