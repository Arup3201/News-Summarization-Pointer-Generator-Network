Anders Lindegaard was given a run-out for Manchester United in a behind-closed-doors friendly with Blackpool on Tuesday.

The Danish goalkeeper is in the frame to play against Arsenal on Saturday with David de Gea having dislocated a finger. It would be Lindegaard's first competitive game under Louis van Gaal and his first for United since April when he started against Newcastle in a 4-0 win.

Lindegaard didn't have too much to do but the 30-year-old was unable to prevent Francois Zoko scoring with a header before half-time which pleased the watching Blackpool coaching staff Lee Clark, Noel Blake and Alan Thompson.

Lindegaard did, however, save comfortably from long range efforts by Andrea Orlandi.

Will Keane scored for United who had a relatively inexperienced side out except for Spain international Ander Herrera, Rhys James and Andreas Pereira.

De Gea could yet play against Arsenal if the swelling on his finger goes down but United may not wish to risk further damage and he will be assessed throughout the week.

Victor Valdes, who continues to train at United, has not been registered with the Premier League and is not being considered at this stage.

Striker Radamel Falcao continued his recovery from injury today along with defender Rafael as they did a pilates session with other teammates.

Meanwhile, former United winger Chris Eagles has signed for Blackpool until January. He is eligible to play against another former club Bolton on Saturday.

Eagles said: 'I've got to do what I love to do best, and that is to excite the crowd, score and create. What I've seen of the club and staff so far has been brilliant.

'I'm chomping at the bit. I've obviously played against Blackpool before, the fans are brilliant with the drum at home, so I'll be looking forward to that.'
