Another woman has come forward claiming she was abused by a celebrated Philadelphia sports columnist when she was a child.

Former Philadelphia Daily News writer Bill Conlin retired just hours before accusations of him molesting children in the 1970s were published.

Now an unidentified 59-year-old woman has told the Philadelphia Inquirer Conlin assaulted her at a beach in Margate, New Jersey when she was 11.

Veteran: Bill Conlin, pictured at a National Baseball Hall of Fame event honouring him for his work, is accused of abusing seven children in the 1960s and 1970s

She said the incident happened in the
1960s - a full decade before he allegedly abused the six other victims 
who have stepped forward.

She told the Inquirer - the paper 
which first published the allegations - their accounts had empowered her to give her own.

'When I read it, I started to cry,' the mother-of-two from Chester County said.

'I just felt overwhelmed. The fact that I wasn't the only one made me feel stronger.'

The latest alleged victim said Conlin, who was a family friend, assaulted her twice during his visits to her family's home.

Stunned, she asked him not to touch her and the abuse ended after she told a lifeguard what had happened.

Retired: Conlin had worked at the Daily News in Philadelphia since 1965 but immediately retired when the article accusing him of abuse was published

It comes just days after a sixth 
accuser, Linda Stella, 50, told the Daily News that Conlin molested her 
on two occasions at his New Jersey home.

Conlin retired abruptly last Tuesday, shortly
before The Inquirer published a story online 
detailing allegations of abuse from three women and a man in the 1970s.

Bill Conlin, now 77, started his Daily News career in 1965, writing about college football, 
professional boxing, baseball, the Olympics and tennis.

He gained 
notoriety as a commentator on the ESPN programme The Sports Reporters.

He was the recipient of the 2011 JG 
Taylor Spink Award, presented at the Baseball Hall of Fame in July, and 
is honoured in the hall's 'Scribes and Mikemen' exhibit, along with 
other celebrated writers.

He is also the author of two baseball-related books, the Rutledge Book of Baseball and Batting Cleanup, Bill Conlin.

On hearing of the first abuse accusations on December 20, he retired from the Daily News immediately, and his editor accepted.

Conlin, who is a grandfather, married wife Irma in 1960 - before the abuse allegedly took place. Irma passed away in 2009.

Prosecutors say Conlin cannot be charged because the statute of limitations has expired.

He has denied the allegations.

'This has obviously been crushing to Mr. Conlin,' his lawyer George Bochetto told the Inquirer. 'Frankly, I am now more concerned about Mr. Conlin and his ability to carry on.'

In the original article posted by the Inquirer, it said three women and a man claim they were molested as children by Conlin in the 1970s.

One of them, Conlin's niece, was quoted by the Inquirer as saying: 'People have kept his secret.

'There were so many people who knew about this and did nothing,' she said.

Conlin, 77, offered to retire, said Daily News editor Larry Platt at a news conference.

'I immediately accepted,' said Platt. 'It was a painful conversation.'

According to the Inquirer, the four 
adults said Conlin groped and fondled them and touched their genitals 
when they were from ages seven to 12.

A detective with the Gloucester, New 
Jersey prosecutor's office said criminal charges 
could not be pursued because assaults that occurred before 1996 fall 
under the statute of limitations.

'We would love to see justice in this
case,' Detective Stacie Lick of the Prosecutor's Office wrote in an 
e-mail to one of the women last month.

Free: As the statute of limitations has expired, Conlin, now 77, 
cannot be charged for any of the alleged child abuse crimes as they occurred too long ago

'So many people have been 
victimized by this man, but our hands are tied by the law, which does 
not let us prosecute.'

His niece told the Inquirer she and the others decided 
to speak out after the child sex abuse scandal at Pennsylvania State 
University brought back painful memories.

At Penn State, former assistant 
football coach Jerry Sandusky faces 52 counts of child sex abuse 
stemming from accusations from ten adult men who say he abused them as 
children.

Oddly, as the Inquirer reports, Conlin questioned people who said they would have intervened had they seen the former Penn State assistant coach abusing a child in a recent column, 'Tough Guys Are Talking About Sandusky.'

'Everybody says he will do the right 
thing, get involved, put his own ass on the line before or after the 
fact,' he wrote. 'But the moment itself has a cruel way of suspending 
our fearless intentions.'
