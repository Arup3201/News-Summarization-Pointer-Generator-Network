A former football player is missing after police found drugs and guns at his Atlanta home.

Former NFL linebacker Jamie Winborn, 34, has been missing since Friday morning when his wife called police and told them she was worried about his behavior and that he had guns and drugs in their home.

Cops paid a visit to the couple’s home in the quiet cul-de-sac of High Falls Court in Southwest Atlanta, but Winborn had left the residence before they arrived.

After securing a search warrant, police searched the home and removed a cache of weapons and an undisclosed amount of marijuana.

Winborn had been battling cancer as recently as last year, reports WSB-TV.

Police haven’t issued an arrest warrant and despite Winborn's odd behavior they don’t believe he is a danger to either himself or the public.

The linebacker played ten seasons in the NFL. He was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the second round of the 2001 NFL Draft after playing college football at Vanderbilt.

Winborn spent ten seasons in the NFL as a linebacker before the Tennessee Titans released him in 2010

In the NFL he played for the Jacksonville Jaguars, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Denver Broncos, Atlanta Falcons and Houston Texans.

His last team was the Tennessee Titans, who released him in October 2010.

Atlanta-native Winborn was the son of Elbert Blake Jr., a notorious drug dealer who he never met after his father went missing.

Rosa Winborn, Jamie's mother, was a paranoid schizophrenic and a drug addict who spent time in prison. He was raised by his uncle and aunt in Texas.
