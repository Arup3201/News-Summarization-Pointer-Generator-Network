Emma Frampton stole almost £40,000 from her employers, but has avoided jail and been told to pay just £1

An accountant who stole almost £40,000 from her employers has avoided jail and been told to pay back just £1.

Emma Frampton, 39, plundered the money over 18-months from Yorkshire Plating Services in Bradford, taking more than half the firm's annual profit and bringing the company to its knees.

A court heard she stole the money by paying it into two accounts  - one a fake company account and another she set up using names of her family - and lavished it on Christmas presents. 

But a proceeds of crime hearing has ordered her to pay back just £1, despite the fact Frampton had benefited £39,019 from her crime, after her lawyers claimed she was in negative equity.

Frampton was given a suspended prison sentence after pleading guilty to theft from her employer, between October 2012 and February this year, and ordered to pay the nominal compensation.

Stephen Middow, 57, managing director of the metal plating company said he was disgusted with the outcome.

Mr Middow said: 'I spent over 30 years trying to build myself a business and she brought it to its knees in just 18 months. I have truly been let down by the justice system and believe they have let her get away with stealing a vast amount of money.'

Frampton was only caught after Mr Middow's accountant noticed the payments, which led back to her.

Mr Middow closed all the bank accounts, which alerted her to the fact she had been caught.

Frampton, who worked at the firm for over two years, immediately bombarded Mr Middow with several text messages trying to arrange a meeting and in one message even offered to pay back all the funds she had taken.

Mr Middow, who is on medication due to stress, said: 'I am absolutely gutted by the whole thing. 

'More so as it was a person I had 100 per cent trust in and as a business owner that is what you should have in your staff. It has been sickening to think about.

'She has caused a massive blow to a small business, which could have resulted in several of her colleagues losing their jobs. It has survived after working closely with our account and thanks to our loyal customer base.'

Frampton reappeared at Bradford Crown Court for a proceeds of crime hearing on Monday. 

Stephen Middow, 57, managing director of Yorkshire Plating Services in Bradford, has described the fee as an insult

Her house was in negative equity and there were no funds in it, so prosecutor Patrick Robertshaw asked for a nominal compensation order of £1.

Judge Peter Benson was satisfied that there were no assets available to satisfy the order.

He added: 'I will make a compensation order in the nominal sum of £1.'

Mr Middow's said he then watched the defendant pay £1 compensation straightaway in the courtroom when she passed the coin to her solicitor advocate, Sarah Guttman, who later handed the coin to the prosecutor.

Mr Middow described the fee as an insult and believes it was done just so they could write the case off.

He added: 'I believe this is a signal to everybody that this kind of behaviour is acceptable. 

'Basically, you can take large amounts of money from a company, not go to jail and only pay back £1 of it.

'The amount of stress I have been put under because of this and it feels like nothing has been done for the victims. I fear other employers will not be protected against this and things need to change as there is simply no deterrent for people not to.

'I think the house should have been sold and I am sure there would have been enough equity to repay more than £1. They could have easily asked her to pay a higher sum over a five-year-period. I just can't see where the justice is in this decision.'
