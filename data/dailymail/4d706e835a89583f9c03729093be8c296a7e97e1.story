Noel Jennings lied to prison staff about having slipped on water outside his cell

A ‘no win, no fee’ legal firm that supported a prison inmate’s fraudulent compensation claim has come under fierce attack from a judge.

Noel Jennings, 23, lied that he had gashed his head after slipping on a wet floor outside his cell in an attempt to deceive a prison into paying him £6,000.

In reality he had sustained the injury play-fighting with another inmate and his lie was exposed when he was recorded bragging about the plan to his girlfriend in a telephone call from prison.

Jailing the serial criminal for two years for perverting the course of justice, Judge Martin Steiger QC attacked the solicitors that backed his case.

He added that ‘the prison governor would be fully justified in banning’ Taylor Legal from representing inmates at the jail for ‘taking no steps to find out this was a deceitful claim’.

Prison officials are understood to have reported the firm to the Solicitors Regulation Authority.

Judge Steiger told Jennings: ‘Prisoners making false claims for damages through solicitors or otherwise will be heavily penalised.’

Manchester Crown Court heard that Jennings, who has 20 previous convictions, was serving time for burglary at Strangeways jail in Manchester when he suffered the 2 inch gash in a fight.

The injury was caused when he attempted to butt a fellow inmate but instead cut his head on the door of his cell.

Katie Jones, prosecuting, said Jennings’s cell was next to the showers, so he ‘hatched a plan’ to try to con money from the jail by blaming it on a slippery floor.

But five days after the incident last December, during routine monitoring of prisoners’ phone calls, Jennings was overheard telling his girlfriend how he planned to make thousands from the scam.

Despite this, the prison continued to
investigate the complaint, and so Jennings repeated the lie to a health
and safety officer and instructed Taylor Legal to pursue his claim for 
£6,000 damages.

In February the firm wrote to prison 
bosses alleging negligence. Jennings was arrested after being confronted
with the incriminating phone call.

The 23-year-old, who has 20 previous convictions, was serving time for burglary when he hatched the plan in Strangeways to scam cash from HMP Manchester last December

In a police interview he admitted: ‘I
thought because the showers were leaking I could make some money out of
it because there was nothing there to say that the floor was wet.’

Prison staff said that at worst the 
floor might have been ‘slightly dampened’ from inmates walking from the 
showers back to their cells.

Dan Gaskell, defending, described 
Jennings’s claim as ‘an act of stupidity’, adding: ‘Whether the claim 
would have got anywhere in the long run remains to be seen.’

Jennings, of Wythenshawe, Manchester, also admitted robbery.

Taylor Legal’s director, Glyn Taylor,
said: ‘We are carrying out an internal inquiry and will co-operate 
fully with any investigation by the Solicitors Regulation Authority.’

According to its website, the firm is a small practice specialising in personal injury and mis-selling claims.

It is understood not to carry out 
regular work with prisoners and is likely to tell any inquiry it had no 
reason not to take Jennings’s account in good faith.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has 
announced a crackdown on claims by serving prisoners, including 
stripping them of legal aid for ‘unnecessary’ complaints.

He says the move would mean 11,000 fewer cases annually and save the taxpayer £4million.
