Apprentice Louis Steward made the most of his biggest ever opportunity when landing the £265,000 Betfred Ebor on Mutual Regard at York.

The 19-year-old jockey, based with trainer Michael Bell in Newmarket, was called up by winning trainer Johnny Murtagh to step in for suspended Ross Coakley after catching the eye of owner Andrew Tinkler.

After he had driven 20-1 shot Mutual Regard to a length and a quarter win from Van Percy, five-pound claimer Steward said: ‘I ran through the race in my mind a thousand times thinking what if. I am still in shock.’

Murtagh, who never won the Ebor during his distinguished career as a jockey, could now aim Mutual Regard at the Melbourne Cup in November.

He said: ‘This lad had been going well at home. He got put up 11lb for winning first time out and I ran him in a Group Three last time and he ran a nice race behind Pale Mimosa (who won the Lonsdale Cup on Friday).

‘Ascot might be on his agenda now, but we'll see about the Melbourne Cup as he loves fast ground.’

Elidor was third while the heavily-backed 9-2 favourite Pallasator ran a big race to be fourth from his wide draw in stall 22, which meant he had to be dropped in almost last on leaving the gates.

He was almost last entering the home straight and the energy he expelled reaching a challenging position under jockey Luke Morris eventually told.

Ironically, Mutual Regard used to be trained by Pallasator’s handler Sir Mark Prescott.

He was bought by Tinkler out of the Prescott stable for 60,000gn at last October’s Horses In Training Sales.
