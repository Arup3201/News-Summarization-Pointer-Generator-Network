Ebola is now 'the biggest health problem facing our world in a generation', David Cameron said today.

The Prime Minister warned other countries to 'look to their responsibilities' to help tackle the epidemic ravaging parts of West Africa amid growing anger at the lack of international support in the fight against the deadly virus.

It came after the International Development Secretary Justine Greening warned that other countries needed to 'wake up' to the threat of Ebola and start helping to combat it.

David Cameron hit out at countries other than Britain, France and the US over the efforts to tackle the Ebola crisis

Mr Cameron said Britain was 'leading the way' in providing assistance to the region and called for other countries to match the UK effort.

The Royal Navy medical ship RFA Argus, which has a fully-equipped 100-bed hospital on board, set sail from Cornwall to Sierra Leone to join the humanitarian effort and is due to reach the area by the end of the month .

But its facilities will not be used to treat Ebola patients themselves but will be there in case any of the UK military and civilian personnel working in the region become ill or are injured during the course of the operation.

Britain has taken on responsibility for fighting the outbreak in Sierra Leone, while the US are leading in Liberia. The French government has agreed to take on the lead role combating the disease in its former colony of Guinea. 

But the Prime Minister said United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki-moon had been right to call for other countries to deliver more in the way of funding and resources.

'This is the biggest health problem facing our world in a generation. It is very likely to affect a number of the countries here today,' Mr Cameron said as he arrived for the 50-plus nation Asia Europe Meeting in Milan, Italy.

'The action we are taking in Sierra Leone where we are committing well over £100 million, 750 troops, training 800 members of health staff, providing 700 beds - we are doing a huge amount.

'I think it is time for other countries to look at their responsibilities and their resources and act in a similar way to what Britain is doing in Sierra Leone, America is doing in Liberia, France is doing in Guinea. Other countries now need to step forward with resources and action because taking action at source in West Africa is the best way to protect all of us here in Europe.'

The Government's demand for greater international support came after after Mr Ban, the UN Secretary General, said last night that a 'huge and urgent global response' was needed to deal with the crisis and that countries which have 'the capacity' should provide funding now.

'This is quite serious. We need an urgent global response and support,' he said.

While some £12.4 million has been pledged to a trust fund set up by Mr Ban, only 100,000 dollars has so far been received.

Mr Ban's predecessor as secretary general Kofi Annan said he was 'bitterly disappointed' at the scale and speed of the international community's response to the crisis.

'If the crisis had hit some other region it probably would have been handled very differently,' Mr Annan told BBC2's Newsnight.

'In fact when you look at the evolution of the crisis, the international community really woke up when the disease got to America and Europe.

'I point the finger of blame at the governments with capacity ... I think there's enough blame to go around.' 

Britain and the United States are the biggest international contributors to the fight against Ebola

International Development Secretary Justine Greening said more needed to be done to fight the Ebola outbreak

Development Secretary Ms Greening  backed Mr Ban's remarks. She said: 'For countries that aren't playing a leading role we need them to start providing resources.'

'Of course Ban Ki-moon is quite right to say we need the rest of the international community to now provide support, channelled through the US trust fund that's been set up.

'The appeal is there in support of governments like the UK and the US…it's in support of enabling those strategies to be able to be scaled up.'

Ms Greening backed UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's call for other countries to do more.

She said: 'He is right to say that many more countries need to get involved. It is simply not going to be a tenable approach to simply leave the UK to work with Sierra Leone, to leave the US to work with Liberia, France to work with Guinea and no other countries get involved.

'Now I think it's fair to say that actually there is now movement, Germany is starting to provide funding.

'The international community now needs to wake up to this crisis, and start putting resources into working with the UK, and the US, in particular, to help deliver our strategy which we believe will be successful.'

Britain and the US have so far contributed the bulk of the cash for the fight to contain the outbreak, jointly providing almost £600million

Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg had contributed more money to the fight against Ebola than India – while Microsoft founder Bill Gates had stumped up half as much as the French government.

Ms Greening said the UK was as 'well-prepared as any country' in preventing the spread of Ebola reaching Europe.

'We have very robust systems in place, we had a training exercise with the NHS over last weekend to put those plans into action and test them.

'People should be clear that the risk to the UK remains low, but we are prepared and we're as well prepared as any country. We've introduced screening at our airports, we're the only European country to have done that so far.'

She said the best thing the Government could do to minimise the risk to Britain was to work with the government of Sierra Leone to 'tackle Ebola over there in first place'.

The ship is fitted with enough medical equipment to act as a floating hospital as good as any NHS institution

Ms Greening said: 'We've got a large programme now that is underway...it includes building treatment beds, and some of the military personnel heading out on RAF Argus will be helping us deliver those. That will provide treatment, not just for Ebola patients, but for healthcare workers. And if they get infected, we will now have much better capability in helping them recover.'

She said Britain would be building 700 treatment beds which would triple the number of beds that Sierra Leone currently has.

A naval ship with a 100-bed medical complex and loaded with helicopters, landing craft, tonnes of emergency supplies and almost 400 personnel left the UK today to head for Sierra Leone.

Royal Fleet Auxiliary Argus, a vast hospital and support vessel, set sail from Falmouth in Cornwall to west Africa and act as a forward base for army medics, engineers, soldiers and aid experts who will build and operate medical centres, train local doctors and nurses and transport vital supplies.

By the end of next month 750 British troops will be operating in Sierra Leone. With troops continuing to withdraw from Afghanistan it will be the largest overseas deployment of UK forces anywhere in the world.

During a visit to the 28,000-tonne RFA Argus the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, described the ship, which first saw action during the Falklands conflict, as a 'warhorse' embarking on a vital humanitarian mission.
