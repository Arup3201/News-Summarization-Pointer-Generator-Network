A collection of more than 2,000 traditional tin plate toys rescued from closing shops and factories is set to fetch thousands of pounds at auction.

Arthur Findlater, 57, started the collection as a boy in Cirencester in Gloucestershire, with most coming from the store rooms of failing toy shops, or from the broken stock departments of factories.

The stash of tin plate robots, bicycle-riding ducks and vintage boats were made between the 1920s and 1990s, and have filled Mr Findlater’s loft and cupboards for decades. Some of the items, which were gathered from all over the world, have been tippped to sell for as much as £80 each.

Among Mr Findlater's colourful collection are original boxed wind-up robots from the 1980s, vintage Batmobile cars and 100-year-old flapping butterflies from Japan.

But the retired toy maker has decided to let go of his entire tin plate fleet in one of Gloucestershire-based Cotswold Auctions' biggest ever sales after his worsening multiple sclerosis made holding his cherished collectables impossible.

Value: Experts believe the simple toys, which were bought for just a few pounds each, could fetch several thousand pounds when they go under the hammer next month

Kapow: This Japanese tinplate Batmobile is up for sale for an estimated £50-£80, along with a boxed German satellite vehicle and a boxed Luxe car

Original: The Japanese Batmobile toy is based on this version from the 1960s TV series. This Batmobile was a modified version of the 1955 Lincoln Futura concept car

Riding: A Chinese-made police officer on a motorcycle. Mr Findlater says he collected the tin plate toys for 30 or 40 years, admitting he 'got a bit obsessive'

Protected: These Japanese-built tin racing cars are being sold still inside the plastic bags they originally came in. Mr Findlater said he acquired his toys all over the world

Gained: This 1931 tinplate model gunboat from Paya in Spain is predicted to sell for between £30 and £40 at Cotswold Auctions

New home: These modern Chinese-made table tennis players are being sold along with three clockwork robots for between £20.00 and £40.00. Mr Findlater says the toys would often sit untouched in shops for years until he bought them

Vintage: These cars from the 1990s were build by Maisto. They are just some of the 2,000 tin plate items being put up for auction by Arthur Findlater

Cherished: The collection is one of the biggest ever sold by Gloucestershire-based Cotswold Auctions. It will be held at Bingham Hall in Cirencester on March 7 at 10am

This Japanese Harley Davidson toy is one of three in Arthur Findlater's huge collection. Each one is estimated to sell for £20 to £30

This Chinese tin plate 'Roxy Robot' (centre) and two smaller 'Goldman' robots are part of a joint lot that is estimated to sell for between £20 and £40

Boxed: Retired toy maker Arthur Findlater has decided to sell his entire collection after his worsening multiple sclerosis made holding the metal treasures impossible

Mr Findlater said he purchased many of the toys directly from factories. 'I used to buy them by the metre, many at a time that were broken, but they only had very small faults and they could be fixed,' he said

This German wind-up duck riding a bicycle is being sold alongside similar figures: a boxed clockwork ice cream vendor, a Chinese-made wind-up snail, a clockwork ice cream vendor and two wind-up mice. The mini-collection is predicted to sell for £40

These widely-collected Victor and Sutcliffe tin boats and submarines from the 1930s are expected to fetch £80 each

Auctioneer Lindsey Braune said: 'It's not every day that we're asked to sell a single collection of more than 2,000 pieces, so we're exited and delighted to do it... It's going to look great when it's all set out, it's so colourful'

Knowledge: Arthur Findlater - a life-long toy collector - was a big name in the wooden toy making world himself, along with his painter wife Mally, 55

The stash of tin plate robots, chickens, butterflies and boats were made between the 1920s and 1990s and have filled Mr Findlater's loft and cupboards for decades

Disabled: Mr Findlater was diagnosed with MS in 2000 and has been confined to a wheelchair for ten years. He has struggled to enjoy the toys ever since

Mr Findlater is selling the toys - many of them boxed - because he can no longer pick them up. 'I fling them across the room by mistake and my assistance dog Daxi isn't allowed to pick them up as they are sharp,' he said

Collection: This 1930s Sutcliffe speedboat is predicted to sell for between £60 and £80 at auction in Cirencester tomorrow

This stunning boxed 1927 hydro-plane from Paya in Spain has been predicted to sell for between £40.00 and £60.00

Arthur Findlater says he struggles to enjoy the toys as a result of his disability. He has already broken several by accidentally running them over with his wheelchair

Replica: This 'Campsa' tanker was built in 2006 in Paya, Spain and is based on a version of the toy from 1925
