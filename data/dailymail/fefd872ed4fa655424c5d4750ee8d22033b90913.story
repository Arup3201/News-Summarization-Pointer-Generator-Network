Melbourne Cup race goers will no doubt be reaching for the Berocca and nursing sore heads this morning as the hangover sets in after a long day of celebrations across the nation.

At this year’s race that stops a nation, more than 100,000 punters flocked through the gates at Flemington racecourse in Melbourne, for a day of horse racing fun, which for some, was just an excuse to take a day off work, dress the part and enjoy with friends.

Punters also packed out other prominent racing venues around the country, including Sydney's Royal Randwick and Brisbane's Eagle Farm. 

While thousands more around the country enjoyed countless lunches, parties and glamorous functions to get in the spirit of Australia's biggest horse race.

But as the day went on, so did the shenanigans, leaving some punters a little worse for wear.

Some opted to ditch the heels and go bare foot, while others ripped off their ties or used the floor as a seat and thank goodness for the trusty old picnic rug where a number of race goers ended up taking a snooze to sleep off a hard day. 

Victorian police were relatively pleased with behaviour, praising Melbourne Cup crowds, with only two people arrested and ten evicted for boozy bad behaviour.

Police said they were all for alcohol-related matters. 

'They have celebrated really safely and we have had no serious incidents reported to us,' Superintendent Cindy Millen told Fairfax Radio.
