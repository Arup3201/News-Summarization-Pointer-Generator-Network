Harry Kane savoured a 'great night' under the White Hart Lane floodlights as his hat-trick helped Tottenham to a 5-1 Europa League victory over Asteras Tripoli.

The England Under-21 striker not only scored his first treble for Spurs but ended the Group C clash in goal after Hugo Lloris’ late sending-off.

He was left red-faced however, after making a complete hash of dealing with Jeronimo Barrales' free-kick, letting the effort go under his body as the Greeks grabbed a late consolation.

Kane finished the match in goal after Hugo Lloris (pictured) was sent off in the closing stages on Thursday 

'It was a great night until I went in goal,' he told ITV4. 'In fairness I think I’ll leave that to the keepers from now on.

'It was a great result for us, a great win, and obviously I’m happy to get the hat-trick.'

Reflecting on his three goals, Kane added: 'The first was a sweet strike. When it left the foot I knew it had a chance and fortunately it came off the post and went in which is always nice.

'I thought it was good to get the second and third as well, extra goals when the team is dead on their feet and when we want to start killing off teams and getting the five goals was great.'

Kane celebrates after completing his first hat-trick for Tottenham in a convincing White Hart Lane victory

Erik Lamela threatened to steal the limelight from Kane with two awe-inspiring strikes of his own.

The Argentina forward brought the 21,428 spectators to their feet on the half-hour mark by wrapping his left foot around his right leg to score with a ‘rabona’ strike from the edge of the box.

Lamela then doubled his night’s tally with a fine volley in the second half and Kane was pleased to see his team-mate get on the scoresheet.

'I’ve seen him do it (on the training ground),' Kane added. 'He’s got that in the locker, so it’s great for him to see it pay off on the big stage of a game and I’m very happy for him because it is two goals.'

Tottenham’s night was slightly soured by the 87th-minute dismissal of Lloris and Jeronimo Barrales’ subsequent consolation strike moments later that Kane let slip through his grasp after he had replaced the Frenchman in goal.

Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino hailed his side’s effort going forward but his side’s failure to keep a clean sheet seemingly irked the former Southampton manager. 

He said: 'No, I’m not satisfied because for me, the result, it is important to get the three points but the last goal make me a little bit unsatisfied.'
