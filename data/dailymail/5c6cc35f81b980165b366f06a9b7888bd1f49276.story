Walking for half an hour a day is equivalent to taking a 'magic pill' that combats ageing and prevents premature death, an expert has said.

Dr James Brown surprised an audience at the British Science Festival by presenting the myriad benefits of a pill that could maintain healthy living and improve quality of life.

The wonder-drug was able to prevent obesity and diabetes, lower the risk of some cancers, relieve depression and anxiety, increase mobility, and reduce the chances of hip fracture by 40 per cent.

It also improved the ability to think and reason, slowed the progression of Alzheimer's disease, cut arthritic pain by 50 per cent, boosted energy levels, reduced fatigue and led to a 23 per cent lower risk of dying.

Dr James Brown from Aston University revealed a 'magic drug' to the British Science Festival today, claiming it prevents obesity and diabetes, lowers the risk of some cancers and relieves depressions and anxiety. He delivered the punchline: 'This isn't a pill, it's exercise'

Then he delivered the punchline: 'This isn't a pill, it's exercise.'

Dr Brown, from the School of Life and Health Sciences at Aston University, said: 'All of these changes are not seen in people who run marathons; they're not seen in people who lift weights in the gym, or spend four hours running on the treadmill. 

'These are seen in people who walk and who walk for half an hour a day.

'You can get all of these health benefits; you can get a reduction in all of these diseases that are associated with ageing, by just keeping active, by walking for half an hour a day.

'If there is one take home message it would be that.'

During his lecture at the University of Birmingham Dr Brown outlined the 'use it or lose it' philosophy behind keeping active and healthy as we age.

He stressed that remaining inactive for too long could lead to muscle loss that may never be recovered. This in turn could have a major impact on quality of life.

Dr Brown described one study that compared the effect of putting a leg in plaster for two weeks in two groups of young and old participants.

The young group lost twice as much muscle mass during that time - probably because they were more muscular to start with - but quickly put it back on when the plaster was removed. After four weeks of gym training, they were back to normal.

In sharp contrast, the older participants' muscle mass was not restored after four weeks, or even eight.

'There's a very good chance that they will never get it back,' said Dr Brown.

He added: 'What we know is that immobility of muscle can cause a significant amount of muscle wastage, and in some cases you never get that muscle back.

'This leads to something called the 'stairway to dependence'. What we now think happens is there's a series of steps of degradations of ability that lead an older adult to go from being independent to dependent.'

Ultimately too much inactivity in an older person resulted in a condition called sarcopenia which was marked by significant muscle loss.

'This can lead to an inability to exercise,' said Dr Brown. 'Maintaining your muscle mass is really important.' 

Dr Brown said: 'You can get all of these health benefits; you can get a reduction in all of these diseases that are associated with ageing, by just keeping active, by walking for half an hour a day'

Dr Carol Holland, from Aston University's Centre for Healthy Ageing, said there was evidence that 30 per cent of dementia cases could be prevented by improving aspects of lifestyle, including physical exercise. 

Keeping the brain active and maintaining social contacts was also important.

'Physical, intellectual and social engagement has a real impact in preventing or slowing intellectual decline in old age,' said Dr Holland. 

'Intellectual decline isn't inevitable. Thirty minutes of moderate exercise a day can reduce your risk of age-related diseases. It can also reduce your risk of cognitive decline.'  

Dr Benjamin Ellis from Arthritis Research UK said: 'We strongly support Dr Brown’s view that exercise is one of the best ways of keeping a number of chronic conditions at bay – including arthritis. 

'Doctors should prescribe physical activity to prevent and treat arthritis, rather than handing out painkillers, and we have to get over the message that exercise is not bad for the joints but is the best way of reducing your risk of getting arthritis.'

The charity’s recently published public health report warns of an ‘arthritis epidemic’ as the population ages and becomes more obese, but stresses the importance of exercise and weight loss as the best way of countering this.

'Healthy physical activity improves the health of our joints and bones, and a wide range of activities such as walking, swimming, cycling and running have all been shown to reduce the overall risk of joint pain and disability,' added Dr Ellis.
