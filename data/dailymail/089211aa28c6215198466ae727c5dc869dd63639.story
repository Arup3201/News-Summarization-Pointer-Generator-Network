Ched Evans, pictured outside his home with his pet dog today, is thought to be on the verge of signing with Oldham Athletic

A protest against Oldham Athletic potentially signing convicted rapist Ched Evans has become one of the fastest growing petitions online.

More than one person per second signed the petition in the first thirty minutes after its launch earlier today.

It came after news broke that Oldham set to make an announcement tomorrow that they have signed Evans to their team.

Addressed to Simon Corney, the chairman of Oldham Athletic FC, the petition reads: We do believe he[Ched Evans] has the right to work.

'We believe that it does not have to be in a role where he influences views about sexual violence, and his presence on your pitch will do this.' 

The petition, which currently has 11,000 signatures, is one of the fastest growing petitions ever on Change.org, i100.co.uk reports. 

It's understood that the former Sheffield United striker will train with Oldham on Monday morning ahead of a move to the League One football club.

Evans was released from prison in October after having served two-and-a-half years of a five year prison sentence for rape.

He was found guilty in 2011 of the rape of a 19-year-old woman, but continues to protest his innocence.

Evans, who is staying in a hotel nearby, wants a return to football after being released from prison in October. A club source said a deal is '50-50'.

The developments represent a dramatic U-turn by Oldham, who insisted they had no intention of landing the 26-year-old last month. 

A statement on December 1 read: 'The Board of Directors would like to confirm that we will not be extending an invitation for Ched Evans to train with Oldham Athletic nor will we be offering him a contract.

'The club will not be making any further comment on this subject.'

Evans was accused of rape in 2011 after having sex with a 19-year-old woman, who cannot be identified, at a hotel near his home town of Rhyl, Denbighshire.

Fellow footballer Clayton McDonald took the woman back to the hotel room before texting Evans, who arrived later.

Evans had tried to claim the intercourse was consensual but a jury found otherwise. Mr McDonald was cleared of the same charge.

Since his release, Evans has continued to deny his guilt and is appealing the judgement.

Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey, 26, who was dating him at the time of the attack, has defended is actions and the pair are now engaged. Ms Massey has insisted he was guilty only of infidelity - not the rape he was jailed for.

Since a November 29 defeat, Oldham have suffered a dramatic downturn and have lost four games in a row.

PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor said there would be a press conference at an unnamed League One club, but it's understood there is not one planned.

'The club are due to hold the press conference tomorrow and I've made it clear to them that I cannot attend tomorrow,' he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme.

According to one board member of Trust Oldham, the official club supporters trust, they have not been consulted about the possible recruitment of Ched Evans.

The trust has a stake in the club and even provides financial support that can extend to the payment of a player’s wages.

But Ray Coverley said he knew nothing of Evans joining the club.

Speaking personally and not on behalf of Trust Oldham, he did however argue that – having served his sentence for rape – Evans was entitled to return to work as a footballer.

'We haven’t discussed it,’ said Mr Coverley. 'But speaking personally I’m of the opinion that if he has served his sentence we can’t keep going on about it.

'I understand the emotional point, but taking that aside he’s now entitled to play football again.'

Senior officials at the club are known to believe Evans' side of the story.

They spoke to the player in late November but decided against making a move amid fears it would  tarnish the club's image.

Maltese side Hibernians announced on Friday it had offered Evans a deal for the remainder of the season, but that move was blocked by the Ministry of Justice as Evans is not allowed to work abroad.

He was initially given permission by Sheffield United to return to train with the club at the request of players union the Professional Footballers Association.

But following a backlash from supporters, sponsors and patrons - with 160,000 people signing a petition opposing his return - the club retracted the offer. 

Television presenter Charlie Webster quit as a club patron of Sheffield United after Evans was invited to train with the team.

Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill asked for her name to be removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane and two shirt sponsors threatened to walk.

Sheffield United retracted their decision, saying in a statement that the club had not anticipated the 'intensity' of the public's reaction.

In November, Evans was linked with a move to Tranmere Rovers after club chairman Mark Palios claimed he had turned down an approach from his associates.  

Mr Taylor has warned that any move for the 26-year-old striker had to be for the right reasons.

'Bearing in mind what happened with his release and then of course the furore that we had at Sheffield United we feel that any club wishing to sign him needs to be 100 per cent committed to signing him for proper and legitimate football reasons,' Mr Taylor added.

Evans' attempts to return have so far been fruitless, with clubs turning down the chance to employ him

Any move to sign Evans is likely to lead to public outcry, but Mr Taylor was keen to avoid a similar situation to the one that engulfed Sheffield United after they made their offer to the player.

'I don't want to create a replica-type situation that we had at Sheffield (United) because I'm a little bit concerned that we need press conference and that will invite, of course, many antagonists,' he said.

Mr Taylor said the PFA appreciated the situation was 'very sensitive', but reiterated its stance that Evans deserved the chance to resume his career following his release from prison.

'We've made it clear in our statements that we feel he's been unable to say much because of the appeals process, but he has served his time and the job of society is to look to rehabilitate.

Any move abroad for Evans is unlikely to materialise given Britain's tough regime in managing sex offenders.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'We are determined to have one of the toughest regimes in the world for managing sex offenders, to stop them re-offending and to protect victims.

'Probation officers must give permission for sex offenders on licence to take up new jobs and this includes ensuring they hold regular face to face meetings - this effectively rules out working abroad.

'The offenders will also be subject to strict conditions such as exclusion zones, non-contact orders and having to attend sex offender treatment programmes.'

Oldham declined to comment.

A women's campaign group are 'appalled'  at rumours a Division One football club was poised to finally sign convicted rapist Ched Evans.

Sex offender Evans, 25, was released from prison last October, halfway through his five year sentence for raping a 19 year-old woman in a hotel room in May 2011.

Already a number of clubs, such as Sheffield United and Hartlepool, who showed interest in signing the shamed striker later changed their mind - after huge backlashes.

Today Sarah Green, of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: 'We are appalled by any football club which signs an unrepentant convicted rapist.

'Ched Evans has shown no remorse for his crime and has actually used his profile to persistently claim his 'innocence' in the media and to re-traumatise his own and many other victims.

'We would ask the owners and the manager of any club thinking of signing Ched Evans - please consider seriously the message you will send to the survivors of sexual violence who are among your fans, and to your whole local community, as well as to football fans as a whole.

'If you sign him you will give him a new platform to continue denying the crime he committed.

'Please reconsider and show that your club has zero tolerance of sexual violence and of attitudes which trivialise or condone it.'

Ms Green said they always feared this January a club would ignore public opinion and try to sign the rapist.

She added: 'As we are in the transfer window it feels this matter will not go away. It is time for the FA to step up and make its views known. Fan associations should urgently do the same.

'The Government estimates that around 85,000 women are raped in England and Wales every year. Rape is not a marginal issue.

'All of us know survivors of rape. The police and courts cannot sanction and deter it alone.

'Everyone, including sports clubs, need to be involved in challenging the attitudes which make excuses for rape and let perpetrators think they can get away with it.'
