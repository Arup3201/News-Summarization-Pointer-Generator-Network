A police constable and a TV engineer fell 20ft to their death after hoardings surrounding a hole in a construction site gave way.

Gavin Brewer, 32, and his partner Stuart Meads, 34, were leaning on the protective boards around a building site near Euston Station in London when they plunged into a basement apartment.

Mr Meads, who works for BBC's The Weakest Link and Mr Brewer, who is part of The British Transport Police, were on their way home from a night out when the 'tragic and bizarre' accident occurred.

Monavon Construction, who operate the site, refused to comment on what happened, but the Health and Safety Executive have said they are investigating.

Mr Meads' friend Stephen Baker, told the Evening Standard that police had described the deaths to the victim's family as a 'freak accident'.

Mr Baker said: 'There is no question of attributing blame to them. It was just a freak accident that could have happened at two in the afternoon.

'They were a wonderful couple. They clearly cared for each other a great deal. They had just come back from a tour of Europe. They were very happy and in love, by all accountts.

'Stuart was like a brother to me. We had known each other since childhood.

'It’s left a massive void in my life. I’m still numb, in complete disbelief. He is going to be sorely missed. He was one of those people who was so full of life.'

A friend of Mr Mead, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: 'We are just completely devastated. 
At least we know they weren’t chased or mugged in the street but two 
people who may have died through negligence.

'We
were told there is CCTV footage of the incident taken from the building
opposite. We hope they have enough to pursue a corporate manslaughter 
charge because what happened is outrageous. It is such a waste of life.'

Tributes: Friends posted their support for the Meads family under the photo of Stuart and his sister Hannah on Facebook

Accident: An official source confirmed that the accident took place at the pictured location

Tributes at the scene included one from Mr Brewer’s best friend Rhiain which read: 'My heart has been broken and will always have a Gav shaped space which will never be filled.'

Another tribute to the police constable said: 'You were taken too young and too early. You will be remembered fondly by all at Finsbury Park.'

A Met police spokesman said: 'Shortly before 2.30am on Saturday morning police were called to reports of two men seen fighting in Hampstead Road.

'Two men have fallen down into the basement area of a building site. Both were pronounced dead at the scene. Their deaths are being treated as unexplained.'

'He said post-mortem examinations were due to take place at noon today and inquests to open on Friday or Monday.

An HSE spokesman said: 'I can confirm we are investigating.'

British Transport Police said: 'We can confirm that serving officer PC Gavin Brewer died whilst off duty early on Saturday, 19 October morning on Hampstead Road.

'PC Brewer was based at Finsbury Park station and had been with the force for nine years. Officers and staff are continuing to support his family and friends through this very difficult time.'
