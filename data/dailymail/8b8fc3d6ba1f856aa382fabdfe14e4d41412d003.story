She had taken to the snowy hills of Western Sweden just last month for a physically demanding charity cross country ski event.

But Pippa Middleton did not need a second invitation to get back on the slopes when she joined her family in more relaxing circumstances on holiday.

While the 56-mile cross-country challenge she completed a month ago is said to be among the toughest in the world, her skiing efforts in the French resort of Meribel were much more sedate during the Middleton family break.

The sister of the Duchess of Cambridge
joined Kate and Prince William, as well as her parents, brother James, 
and close friend George Percy in the Trois Vallees.

The appearance on the break of Earl 
Percy, heir to the £300million fortune of his father, the Duke of 
Northumberland, is likely to fuel rumours that the former couple could 
be getting back together.

The Middletons would have had plenty to catch up on during their Easter break at the exclusive French resort.

The Duchess, herself an accomplished 
skiier, will have been keen to fill in her husband on the success of her
recent solo engagements.

Prince William was reunited with his wife after completing his RAF tour in the Falkland Islands.

Pippa, meanwhile, look happy to simply
have a more leisurely skiing session following her grueling exploits 
in Scandinavia last month.

When she was quizzed over her efforts, Pippa, 28, told the reporter in Sweden she found the race 'tiring'.

Ms Middleton, who engaged in a series 
of last-minute training sessions to brush up on her technique said she 
simply prepared 'over a couple of weekends'.

She also refused to rate herself out of 10, saying she was an 'average' skier.

The arduous training more than paid 
off in the end, as Pippa managed to secure an impressive 412th place out
of 15,800 racers when the race went ahead on the weekend.

She crossed the finish line of the 
Vasaloppet Cross Country Ski Race after seven hours, 13 minutes and 36 
seconds – described by veterans as a ‘very impressive’ time.
