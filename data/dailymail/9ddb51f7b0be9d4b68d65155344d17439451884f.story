A self-confessed sugar daddy has revealed how to successfully manage a 'mutually beneficial' relationship.

Trent, a 45-year-old financier who declines to give his real name for professional reasons, told the New York Post that a kept woman shouldn't be treated like a 'possession, chattel or employee,' otherwise she's more than likely to leave.

The recently turned columnist for Earn the Necklace -  an advice website for wealthy men and their kept women - adds that the arrangement might be 'unconventional', but 'it’s still a relationship; it’s not just a 
business transaction.

'She might not want to be handed an envelope stuffed with cash.'

To make things clear from the get-go, Trent says both parties should state their expectations, on financial, emotional and physical fronts.

'The 
sugar daddy has the money, and the sugar baby has the sugar. Both have 
what they know the other person wants.

'The relationship is about willfully fulfilling each other’s needs with something you can easily give.'

Indeed, one sugar daddy reveals anonymously on the blog site sugarsugar.com that he always talks 'arrangement' before engaging in a relationship.

'I’m not a free ride, I have wants and needs just like anyone else, and I really don’t want to be taken advantage of,' he explains.

'While I can help them out of some financial 
trouble, they can be company to me when I need to go out of town for 
business'

'The mutually beneficial part of our relationship is that while I can help them out of some financial trouble, they can be company to me when I need to go out of town for business and want to show someone a place they haven’t been before.'

He adds that he finds women on websites such as arrangementfinders.com and sugardaddie.com‎.

When it comes to sex, relationship advisor Trent says that a 'real' sugar daddy will not 
become intimate too quickly with his sugar baby.

Instead, he advises moving things into the bedroom on the third or fourth date.

In a bid to keep things simple, he says emotions should be left out of the equation.

If a sugar baby becomes too attached, it is up to the sugar daddy to remind her what the initial arrangement was and vice versa.

As the anonumous blogger on sugarsugar.com explains, he is not a boyfriend or husband, but more like 'a knight in shining armor.'

'I really like being able to give that gift of showing someone
the world,' he concluded
