Cristiano Ronaldo was put through his paces during a Portugal training session as they prepare to face Serbia in a crunch Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday.

Portugal host their European rivals knowing a victory would stretch the gap over Serbia to eight points after four matches.

Despite the importance of the tie, with Denmark currently sitting top of Group I with seven points, Ronaldo and his team-mates seemed in good spirits.

The Real Madrid striker has been in fine form for his club this year and has scored an impressive 31 La Liga goals in 25 matches.

However, the former Manchester United player will be aiming to put last Sunday's El Clasico defeat by Barcelona behind him.

Ronaldo was on the scoresheet at the Nou Camp when he equalised after Jeremy Mathieu had opened the scoring but Luis Suarez's winner secured a 2-1 victory for Barcelona.

Portugal have endured an indifferent Euro 2016 qualifying campaign so far after losing their opening fixture at home against Albania.

But victories against Denmark and Armenia leaves them in second spot and a win on Sunday would stretch their gap over Serbia to eight points after four matches.
