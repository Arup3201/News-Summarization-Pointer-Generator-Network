A professional footballer throttled and punched a motorcyclist so hard in a road rage attack that doctors thought he might have brain damage, a court has heard.

Matt Partridge, 19, who is signed with Reading FC, attacked 40-year-old James Mannion in a layby in Woolhampton, Berkshire.

He grabbed the victim by the throat, before repeatedly punching him - causing him to fall to the ground with blood pouring down his face.

Shockingly, Partridge,
 who is 6ft 3in tall and tattooed, put so much weight behind each blow 
that his own feet left the floor, according to eyewitnesses.

Mr
 Mannion was taken to hospital with temporary blindness following the 
incident, where he was given a CT scan - with doctors fearing he may 
have suffered brain damage. 

He was left with a flap of
 skin hanging from his neck, a broken bone in his larynx and was
told he could suffer health problems for the rest of his life as a 
result of the attack on August 29 last year.

Now, magistrates in Newbury have told Partridge that a judge at crown court will decide his sentence as they 
feel they do not have enough powers to deal with him.

At
 an earlier hearing, Partridge admitted a single charge of assault 
causing actual bodily harm - but said he had thrown the two punches in 
self defence.

However,
 prosecutors rejected his claims - triggering a Newton Hearing, which 
aimed to establish the facts of the case before sentencing.

During
 the hearing, Mr Mannion told the court that the footballer had attacked
 him after they both pulled into the layby following a road collision.

Mr Mannion said he had started to take photos of Partridge's silver Vauxhall Astra's registration - at which point, Partridge became violent.

'It was as if a red mist descended,' said Mr Minnion. 'He said: "Stop taking picture of my car. You're going to pay for what you've done - I'm going to kill you".

'He then closed the distance between us and grabbed my throat in a choking grip, lifting me onto the balls of my feet, before pushing me into a bramble bush.'

Shaken but determined, Mr Mannion said he then tried to photograph the Astra again.

When Mr Partridge strode back and 
stood toe-to-toe with him, Mr Mannion said he instinctively pushed him 
out of his personal space.

'The
 defendant then said something I will remember forever. He said: "Youâ€™ve
 put your hands on meâ€¦ now I can do what I like",' he said.

Mr
 Mannion said Partridge had then started raining punches on his body - 
adding: 'As the last punch landed, I went blind. I sank to my knees and 
he stood over me. I let out a guttural scream - a cry for help.

'I could feel blood pouring through my fingers onto my trousers.'

Magistrates heard that Partridge, from Thatcham, Berkshire, had already received a caution for a similar attack on a stranger.

Presiding Magistrate Susan Snell said they had found in favour of the prosecution - adding that there were discrepancies in Partridges evidence and they had found Mr Mannion to be a truthful witness.

'You need more punishment than we can give you so we're committing you, on bail, to the Crown Court in Reading for sentence,' she told Partridge.

A spokesman for Reading FC said they would not comment on the case until after sentencing.
