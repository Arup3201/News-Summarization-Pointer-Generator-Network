Gun threat: Rodney Wold waved an AK47 at his neighbor to stop him scaring rabbits away

A 64-year-old man brandishing an AK47 assault rifle allegedly threatened his neighbor after spotting him trying to scare rabbits away from his garden.

Rodney Wold, from Louisville, shouted from his porch: 'If you want to hunt something, hunt men', according to police. 

The dispute on Thursday started when Wold's neighbor was using an air rifle to scare rabbits away from his back garden.

When Wold saw the neighbor, he allegedly fetched the AK47 from his house and appeared on his porch moments later, brandishing it. 

'He loaded the magazine with, I 
believe it was, 19 rounds and went back outside and pointed it at his 
neighbor,' police 
spokesman Carey Klain said.

She added that Wold then told his neighbor: 'If you want to hunt something, hunt men.'

When police arrived, Wold admitted that he had armed himself and confronted the neighbor.

The victim's wife, who has not been named, told WLKY the family had experienced previous problems with Wold.

Police discovered the AK47 under Wold's bed. The gun has since been confiscated and Wold has been barred from keeping weapons.

'It is never OK to resolve any type of argument with a weapon of any sort, much less a gun,' Ms Klain said.

Pest control: The victim had been using an air rifle to scare rabbits away from the family's garden

The dispute appeared to be centered on Wold's objection to his neighbor shooting at rabbits.

Air rifles are often used to keep the animals out of gardens, but more humane pest control includes putting up fences around vegetable plots.

A judge set Wold's bond at $5,000 in cash and ordered him to stay away from his neighbors.

He was charged with first-degree wanton endangerment and is due back in court next month.
