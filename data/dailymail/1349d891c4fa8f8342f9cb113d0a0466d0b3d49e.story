The brother of the Labour frontbencher forced to quit for sneering a white van van is today revealed to be a truck-driving builder.

Islington MP Emily Thornberry was ousted by Ed Miliband after tweeting a photo of a white van outside a Rochester house draped in St George's flags, telling MailOnline that she had 'never seen anything like it'.

Other Labour MPs accused her of being out of touch with Britain's working class, but it has now emerged her brother Ben, 50, has recently returned to England from America, where he worked in construction and drove two 'red trucks with tools in them'.

Defence: Ben Thornberry (pictured), who works in the construction industry, said that his sister wasn't 'looking down her nose' at others when she posted the tweet of a family home draped in England flags

Ms Thornberry sparked a huge row last week while on the campaign trail in the Rochester by-election, and within hours was forced to resign as shadow attorney general.

She posted the image of the house, belonging to Dan Ware, a cage-fighting car dealer who branded her a 'snob'.

Critics noted that as a resident in upmarket North London, she had little idea about life outside her metropolitan bubble. 

Ms Thornberry told MailOnline: 'I was brought up in a council house and I've never seen anything like it.' 

But her brother Ben has spoken of how the property was like the one they grew up in as children. 

Speaking to the Islington Tribune, Mr Thornberry defended his sister, saying that there was no way she would be 'looking down her nose' at others.

He insisted he did not think she was sneering at the property, and it was a refection of the way other people viewed white van drivers.

Wearing a hi-vis jacket and drinking tea in a cafe, he revealed how he was a van driver himself. 'In America, I had two trucks with tools in. They were red, not white. From someone who is in the construction industry, and has been for many years in a foreign country, I cannot believe this wild reaction and how all these people are jumping on construed ideas.' 

Mr Miliband, the Labour leader, was mocked last week for claiming that when he saw a van all he thought was: 'Respect.' 

Resignation: Ms Thornberry, 54, (pictured) a close Ed Miliband ally and one of the first to back him as leader in his battle against brother David, stepped down from her post as Shadow Attorney General on November 20

Ms Thornberry was one of the first to back Ed Miliband as leader in his battle against brother David.

But Mr Miliband was said to have never been so angry when he saw Ms Thornberry's tweet, and her subsequent explanation that she had never seen anything like the house in Rochester.

But Mr Thornberry brother said that the house she photographed 'looks like the one they grew up in' on a council estate outside Guildford, Surrey.

He added: 'It says more about their own perception, and their real feelings, rather than the person who took a pic of a house that looks like the one they grew up in with their younger brother who works in the construction industry.'

Mr Thornberry and his sister were raised by their mother, a teacher, on the Bellfields estate in Guildford, after their parents divorced and his father moved to New York to work for the United Nations.

Mr Thornberry, who has recently returned to England after 26 years in America, works for a charity that gives disadvantaged young people a way into the construction industry. While in New York he worked as a builder and a freelance photojournalist. 

He argued that their background meant that it was 'in their genes' to help the 'poorest in society'.

Controversial: Ms Thornberry posted this picture of a home in Rochester on Twitter. The MP for Islington South and Finsbury was  attacked for her subsequent comments  that she had 'never seen anything like it'

Ms Thornberry, who lives in £3million Victorian townhouse, protested that she had become a victim of anti-Islington prejudice - an area that has become a by-word for champagne socialism. 

But Mr Miliband said he was ‘angry’ with Ms Thornberry because it gave the ‘that somehow Labour had the wrong view of that family’.

He said: ‘It's not the view we have of that family. Labour's never had that view of disrespect and I'm afraid her tweet conveyed a sense of disrespect - that's not my view, that's not Labour's view, it's wrong, it never will be our view and that's why I think it was right she resigned.’

Asked what went through his mind when he saw a white van outside a house with England flags, Mr Miliband replied: ‘What goes through my mind is respect - respect is a basic rule of politics and I'm afraid her tweet conveyed a sense of disrespect.’

Humble beginnings: Mrs Thornberry, who lives with her husband in a Victorian townhouse in Islington, north London (pictured), grew up with her brother on a council estate outside Guildford, Surrey

The Islington South MP faced a barrage of criticism including from outraged Labour colleagues who accused her of being 'derogatory'.

One senior Labour insider said it was 'worse than the Gillian Duffy moment' when Gordon Brown was recorded calling a voter a 'bigoted woman'.

Labour MPs and senior frontbenchers began privately calling for Ms Thornberry to be ousted from the shadow Cabinet last night before Mr Miliband decided she had to go.

Tory think tank chief David Skelton said it was an example of the 'outrageous snobbery of modern Labour. Sneering at working people.'

Mr Ware, the owner of the house said Ms Thornberry 'should have asked me first' before taking the picture of his three-bedroom home, which he bought with wife Maria for £119,000 in 2002.

The father of four said he had simply put up the three St George flags to celebrate the World Cup, and that it was 'not political'.

Referring to Miss Thornberry, he said: 'She's a snob. What's she got, a three-storey townhouse in Islington? These flags can be found anywhere you look.'

He works in the motor trade and does property maintenance.

Born in 1960, Ms Thornberry, 54, is the daughter of the late Cedric Thornberry, who worked for 17 years as Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations and his wife Sallie, a teacher. 

Her parents divorced when Ms Thornberry was seven, and she and her brother, Ben, were raised by their mother, a former Labour Councillor and Mayor, on a council estate outside Guildford, Surrey.

Having failed the 11-plus exam, Miss Thornberry attended a secondary-modern school and then the University of Kent in Canterbury. 

She joined the Labour party at 17, motivated, she said later, by her 'hard' and 'unfair' upbringing. 

She then joined the chambers of Michael Mansfield QC, the celebrity left wing barrister.

The 54-year-old shadow attorney general was a human rights barrister before she was elected the MP for Islington South and Finsbury in 2005.

Miss Thornberry and her High Court judge husband moved into the street, where homes are valued at up to £4.7milllion, in the same week as Tony and Cherie Blair, who lived there before moving to Downing Street. 

Shortly before winning her seat, it emerged the mother-of-three had sent her daughter to a selective school more than miles from her home and far outside her constituency. She refused to defend her decision describing it as a 'private' matter. 

And in 2007 it was revealed that, despite Ms Thornberry’s campaign for more social housing, her husband had bought a three-storey former housing association property for £500,000 and was renting it out to private tenants, some of them Labour activists. 

Once in Parliament, she allied herself with the Brownites against Tony Blair and also found time to be chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Cycling Group. 

When Gordon Brown entered Downing Street, she put her first foot on the ministerial ladder as an aide in the Climate Change department, where she worked under Ed Miliband.

She was the first MP to nominate Mr Miliband to be Labour leader when he stood against his brother in 2010.

Her loyalty was rewarded with a shadow ministerial post and in April 2011 she was appointed Shadow Attorney General.
