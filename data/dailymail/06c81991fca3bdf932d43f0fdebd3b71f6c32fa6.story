Yorkshire's prehistoric past - complete with swamps, a tropical rainforest and even sharks - has been revealed in enormous detail after scientists unearthed fossils in Doncaster.

As well as the 310 million-year-old shark egg case, several horseshoe crabs and some previously unrecorded seed pods were discovered at the disused Yorkshire Main Colliery in Edlington. 

Some of the fossilised plants and creatures may even be entirely new to science, claim experts.

The fossilised shark egg case (pictured left) was discovered on the site of the disused Yorkshire Main Colliery in Edlington, Doncaster. As well as the egg case, several previously unrecorded seed pods were unearthed, some of which may even be new to science, claim experts from the University of Manchester

The shark egg case is particularly rare and significant, because it is soft bodied and so an unusual object to find fossilised, explained researchers.

Incredibly well-preserved baby shark fossils with strange, long snouts recently became the oldest evidence of an ancient shark nursery.

The fossils, found at Mazon Creek, Illinois, at the site of an nuclear plant, were uncovered earlier this year, with egg cases from the same species dating to about 310 million years ago.

The findings suggests that the prehistoric relative of modern day sharks lived in freshwater but migrated down rivers to give birth in salty seawater. 

All the finds were found preserved in rocks that formed within the coal and shale deposits of the abandoned mine. 

It is said to be one of only a small handful of similar fossil locations left in the UK.

Palaeontologist Dean Lomax, a visiting scientist at the University of Manchester's School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, said: 'The fossils unlock a window into a long distant past, buried deep beneath residents' feet. 

'They are proof that parts of Yorkshire were once a tropical water-logged forest, teeming with life that may have looked something similar to today's Amazon delta - a mix of dense forest, lakes, swamps and lagoons.  

'We hope that future organised collections may reveal further rare discoveries, such as dragonflies, beetles, spiders and further evidence of vertebrates. 

'And who knows, maybe we will even find the actual shark.' 

A fossil of a horseshoe crab (pictured) was also discovered in Edlington. Experts said they hope future organised collections at the site may reveal further rare discoveries, such as dragonflies, beetles, spiders and further evidence of vertebrates

After visits to all the redundant pit tips in the region, by Mr Lomax, alongside Peter Robinson from Doncaster Heritage Services and local fossil collector Brian Williams, Edlington was identified as being the only tip in the borough where fossils could potentially still be collected. 

All other locations have been landscaped and turned into parks.

Mr Robinson said: 'For all three of us this site, and the fossils we've discovered here, are very close to our hearts.

The largest predator to walk - and swim - the Earth was a terrifying cross between Tyrannosaurus rex, a crocodile and a whale, researchers have revealed.

The discovery was made from fossils dug up in the Moroccan Sahara, which show that the Spinosaurus was the first dinosaur to have adapted to an aquatic lifestyle.

Weighing 20 tonnes and measuring almost 50ft (15m), the swimming dinosaur was 9ft (2.7m) longer than the largest T. rex specimen known.

Spinosaurus' (artist's impression, pictured)  most distinctive feature was a row of spines down the middle of its back. Scientists think it was used for 
display purposes rather than to trap heat or store fat

It had jaws filled with vicious slanted teeth and a snout like that of a massive crocodile, while its short muscular hind legs were equipped for paddling and resembled those seen in early limbed whales.

The creature also had powerful forelimbs with curved, blade-like claws ideal for hooking into or slicing prey.

While other dinosaurs, such as T. rex, hunted on land, Spinosaurus pursued sharks and other large fish in the deep river system it inhabited.

Plesiosaurs, a family of giant marine reptiles, lived alongside Spinosaurus 97 million years ago, but were not dinosaurs.

Lead researcher Dr Nizar Ibrahim, from the University of Chicago, said: 'Working on this animal was like studying an alien from outer space; it's unlike any other dinosaur I have ever seen.'

The fossils (including the plant fossils pictured) are being stored at Doncaster Museum where they have been integrated into the museum's fossil collection, with full findings of the research being published in the Geological Journal

'We are all locally born and bred and take great pride in uncovering, interpreting and preserving a very important piece of the borough's geological past.

'We hope this important discovery will encourage ex-miners from the borough to bring forward and donate fossil specimens from the now defunct collieries, which were collected whilst extracting coal from the pit face. 

'We have heard many stories of some of the wonderful fossils that have been found.'

The fossils are being stored at Doncaster Museum where they have been integrated into the museum's fossil collection, with full findings of the research being published in the Geological Journal.
