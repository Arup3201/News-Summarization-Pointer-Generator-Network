A chief surgeon, her husband and their 11-year-old son were killed in a 'suspicious' blaze which engulfed their rural Arizona home yesterday morning.

The badly burned bodies of Casa Grande Regional Medical Center surgeon Joyce Bonenberger Brough, 51, Dennis Edward Brough, 50, and Trevor were found in separate rooms by firefighters about 6.40am.

Neighbors tried to rescue the family, who had moved into the Casa Grande single-story home about three weeks ago, but the fire was 'out-of-control'.

Colleagues were devastated at news of the deaths, with the family described as 'loving' and 'close-knit'.

The couple were planning to throw a big party at their home for Trevor's 12th birthday today.

'She (Bonenberger) was very much a family person,' Rona Curphy, Casa Grande Regional Medical Center president and CEO, told azcentral.com.

'(The family members) were seen around this hospital many times. As a family they were very close. They did things together all of the time.'

Curphy said Bonenberger was scheduled to perform surgery around the time of her death. 

'We were just devastated. I knew that as an organization, we had lost somebody very beloved but 
more than that we’ve lost a great surgeon who was really a part of our 
community,' she said.

Bonenberger's husband Dennis worked as an office manager at her private clinic in Casa Grande.

Demolished: The family's single-story home inside the Desert Highlands subdivision near the intersection of Arizona 87 and Interstate 10 northeast of Casa Grande in Arizona was burned to the ground

Investigating: Police and arson investigators are trying to determine the cause of the fire

Newly-released 911 recordings reveal neighbors frantically tried to help the family as their home near the intersection of Paseo Del Sol and Henness Road in the Desert Highlands subdivision erupted in flames.

A witness said they saw the fire spread from the garage to the house, while another tried to explain to the emergency dispatcher the location of the remote home as the tiles began falling off the roof.

The dispatcher told the caller he could hear the roaring blaze in the 
background.

Neighbor Frank Chirumbolo said his son tried kicking in a door and throwing rocks through windows 
to rescue the trapped family.

'There was just too much smoke,' he said.

'I've never seen a house burn like that. The house went up like a matchbox.'

Shortly after calling, the first neighbor indicated that finding survivors had become a lost cause.

'We’ve done what we can here,' he said.

'It is fully engulfed. It looked to me like it started in the garage. It’s moving toward the house now.'

Neighbors stood, helpless, as the roof began to cave in.

'It’s getting a lot worse now,' he said. 'It’s moved into the house.'

Emergency officers from the Regional Fire Department, Casa Grande Fire Department and the Gila River Fire Department found Brough's body in the garage, Bonenberger's body in the master bedroom and Trevor in another bedroom.

'Neighbors, deputies and firefighters did all they could to try and save the lives of the three people inside of this home,' Sheriff Paul Babeu said in a statement.

Officers said the blaze was being treated as suspicious.

Two vehicles owned by the family were parked at the house.

Police
and arson investigators are trying to determine the cause of the fire.

The victims have not been officially identified. Medical
examiners said they would use dental records to identify the bodies.

Bonenberger had been with Casa Grande Regional Medical Center since 
1999 and chief of surgery since 2004, according to the 
hospital's press release.

She helped pioneer a new treatment for women with 
early-stage breast cancer in 2011. The protocol involved surgical removal of the
breast tumor, followed immediately by radiation, the hospital said.
