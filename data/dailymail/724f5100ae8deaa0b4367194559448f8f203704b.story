For Leeds Rhinos the wait is over and one of rugby league’s great peculiarities is no more.

Not since 1999 had this great sporting institution celebrated a Challenge Cup Final victory. Six times they had tried in recent years and six times, remarkably, they had failed.

Now, after this compelling and deserved victory over neighbours and underdogs Castleford, Brian McDermott’s team have the sport’s most cherished trophy back in their possession again.

Big occasion: Castleford and Leeds met at Wembley for the 113th final of its type

Early lead: Tom Briscoe scores the first try of the game at Wembley

Few could argue with the result either. Leeds began well, scored an early try through winger Tom Briscoe and never really looked back.

Castleford, the surprise entity of the rugby league season, railed briefly at the start of the second half and the game was alive when Oliver Holmes powered over to bring the score back to 16-10.

But this was a day when Leeds always looked destined to win and it was fitting that one of the games true titans, winger Ryan Hall, scored his second try late in the game to earn himself the Lance Todd Man of the Match trophy and his team the victory.

Given the enormity of the occasion and the challenge facing them, it seemed imperative that Castleford started the game well. Unfortunately for Daryl Powell’s team, they couldn’t find their rhythm and it only took Leeds a matter of minutes to score.

The big Castleford prop Craig Huby – playing just two weeks after dislocating his elbow – tried to lay down something of a marker with an early hit on Kevin Sinfield but Leeds began with purpose and zest and it wasn’t a surprise when pressure build down the left allowed the favourites to move the ball across the field where centre Kallum Watkins supplied Briscoe with an invitation to dive over in the right corner.

Crucial: Danny McGuire scores his side's second try of the game against Castleford

Sinfield kicked with customary precision and calm from the touchline and Leeds were away.

For a while, Castleford did show something of their true selves.

Winger Justin Carney was unfortunate not to score when he went over only for referee Phil Bentham to pull play back. A minute or so later, however, Castleford were over as Daryl Clark ran on to a Marc Sneyd kick to bundle Zak Hardaker out of the way and touch down.

Despite Sneyd missing a rather kickable conversion, Castleford were back in the game but it was the period between then and the interval that left them with such a long road back. Leeds, at this point, were just too precise, too reliable.

Leeds’ second try was certainly a poor one from a Castleford point of view as full-back Luke Dorn stood transfixed beneath a routine Rob Burrow kick and Danny McGuire leapt above him to score.

With Sinfield kicking expertly once again, this time from the left, Leeds had their noses in front and six minutes later they came up with one of the tries of which they are so capable.

Seemingly pinned down on his own goal line, Hardaker somehow sprung three tackles to make 50 metres and begin a sequence that ended with Hall forcing his way past Kirk Dixon from a standing start to bundle the ball over.

High hopes: Castleford fans look ahead to the Challenge Cup final at Wembley

It was classic play from Hall, one of Super League’s most remarkable athletes, and, despite Sinfield missing the conversion, it have Leeds a 16-4 half-time lead they never really looked like relinquishing.

Castleford did find some rather belated adrenaline to feed off early in the second half and scored their second try on the back of a breakaway that saw Jamie Ellis, Dorn and Michael Shenton combine to send in the second row Holmes.

On another day, Powell’s brave team may have used that score as a platform for recovery. Here, though, Leeds were not to be denied and perhaps the decisive try of the afternoon arrived with 13 minutes left.

This time it was Leeds interchange Paul Aiton who did the groundwork, scurrying laterally along the ten metre line to feed Hall. Once again the big winger had everything to do as three Castleford men stood between him and the line.

Seconds later, though, Liam Finn, Holmes and Weller Hauraki lay on the floor like crumpled white bed sheets as Leeds celebrated the score that means that in the pubs of places like Wigan, St Helens and Bradford they must now find something else to laugh about.
