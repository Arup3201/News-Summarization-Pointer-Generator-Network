For twenty days now, the New York City Police have been searching for Avonte Oquendo, the 14-year-old autistic boy who disappeared from his Long Island City school.

According to a teachers' union memo obtained by Capital New York, none of the administrators at the brand-new Riverview School had passwords to access the security camera feeds on October 4, the day Avonte went missing.

In response to the memo, schools chancellor Dennis Walcott said through a spokesman that the education department's 'Special Commissioner for Investigations is investigating what happened, and we intend to take a serious look at his findings'.

Administrators at the brand-new Riverview School in Long Island City, didn't yet have access to security camera feeds the day 14-year-old autistic boy Avonte Oquendo went missing, according to a union memo

Missing: Avonte Oquendo is mute and autistic. He vanished October 4 from his Long Island City school in Queens, New York. Subway workers fanned out Saturday in search of the boy, who is fond of trains and has been fond wandering the tunnels before

Security footage of his escape was eventually acessed and aired on local television stations. It shows Avonte running down the hall and exiting the building through a side door.

But according to the memo written on October 9, school security guards wouldn't have even seen Avonte leaving the building since they didn't have monitors to watch the security camera feeds.

Runaway: CCTV footage shows Avonte Oquendo running through the corridors of his school towards the exit on October 4

Avonte Oquendo is seen on the street outside his school on October 4 before he turned the corner and disappeared out of sight

Apparently there was 'no monitor at the front desk' and a 'console for [the] school security agent is also on order as well'.

Without
 access to that security footage, school officials originally believed 
Avonte 'ran back up another staircase' and remained in the building

So
 an hour after he went missing, they called Avonte's mother and had her 
come in and try and coax him out of hiding by talking over the PA 
system.

Already gone: An hour after they noticed Avonte was missing, school officials called his mother to come in and try to coax him out of hiding - believing he was somewhere in the school

But as security footage would later reveal, he was long gone.

In addition to the surveillance footage problems, there were other security aspects that could have prevented Avonte's disappearance had they been installed in the school that day.

The memo mentions that the school informed employees after Avonte's disappearance that they would be installing temporary panic bars on the doorways to be replaced by permanent bars later.

Architecture firm Gran Kriegel Associates is also being brought in to look into other features to prevent future escapes such as additional cameras and windows on doors.

A spokesman for the department of education declined to comment to Capital about the various security features that could have prevented Avonte's disappearance.

Police commissioner Ray Kelly announced on Monday that the NYPD might be 'scaling down' the search for Avonte this week.

Several promising leads have failed to produce any results in the case, keeping both hope and disappointment very much alive.

On October 13, the reward for Avonte's return had reached $70,000.var nbcLP={};nbcLP.aRandomNumber=Math.floor(Math.random()*10000);nbcLP.currentPageLoc=encodeURIComponent(window.location.href);nbcLP.currentSiteLoc=encodeURIComponent(window.location.host);nbcLP.defaultWidth=634;nbcLP.defaultHeight=367;nbcLP.cmsID="227456101";nbcLP.vidPid="rZx_Rgw236p1";nbcLP.vidSec="news";nbcLP.vidSubSec="local";nbcLP.vidFrame=document.getElementById("nbcLP227456101");nbcLP.vidFrame.style.border="none";nbcLP.vidFrame.width=nbcLP.defaultWidth;nbcLP.vidFrame.height=nbcLP.defaultHeight;nbcLP.vidFrame.scrolling="no";nbcLP.vidFrame.src="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/templates/nbc_partner_player?cmsID="+nbcLP.cmsID+"&videoID="+nbcLP.vidPid+"&width="+nbcLP.defaultWidth+"&height="+nbcLP.defaultHeight+"&sec="+nbcLP.vidSec+"&subsec="+nbcLP.vidSubSec+"&turl="+nbcLP.currentSiteLoc+"&ourl="+nbcLP.currentPageLoc+"&rand="+nbcLP.aRandomNumber;

Avonte was reportedly spotted at a school festival in the DUMBO neighborhood of Brooklyn on October 12 around 5:30pm, reports the Daily Dot.‘The kid in reference caused a bit of a stir as he stood very close [to the DJ],’ wrote the children’s entertainment company FuziPop on their Facebook page, ‘trying to touch the DJ equipment multiple times.’

Leads?  Avonte may have been sighted at a gathering in the DUMBO area of Brooklyn on October 11

Avonte cannot care for himself and his family says he may appear soiled and has potentially stopped responding to his own name

Avonte’s brother Danny has helped make the online search go viral in the days since his disappearance. Thousands of followers have been added to Danny’s social media accounts and a Facebook page called Missing Avonte Oquendo has become a virtual hub for the search.Facebook followers have helped get the flier widely dispersed and have even gotten it translated into Chinese and Portuguese. ‘Avonte requires 24 hour supervision. He is 14 in body, but he has the mind of a very young child,’ reads the Facebook page. ‘Avonte has been alone for 10 days. He needs your help. He may appear dirty, he will have gone to the bathroom on himself, he may seem disoriented and no long answer to his name.’On October 12, family and friends organized a vigil Saturday and search parties have fanned out from their headquarters in Queens across the city to help bring Avonte home.'We get leads throughout the day, and whenever we get them, we try to take them seriously,' said Danny Oquendo. 'We call police detectives, then volunteers who go to that area.'

Search continues: The search operations continued October 13 from their headquarters near Avonte's school in Queens and family remained hopeful Avonte would be found

The following morning, the search seemed to be focused in an area of Queens north of where Avonte first disappeared.

‘We need more volunteers to canvas the Ditmars area with a focus around 19th and 20th Ave between 37th Street and 81st street,’ Danny urged on his Twitter account @KingDetrick. ‘Go in groups!’

Avonte was last seen wearing black jeans, black sneakers, and a grey striped shirt. He is 5-foot-3 and weighs 125 pounds. Anyone with information is urged to call the NYPD Crime Stoppers line at 800-577-TIPS.
