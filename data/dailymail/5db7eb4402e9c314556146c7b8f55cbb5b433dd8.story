A kindergarten teacher has been hailed a hero after jumping into a 75ft-deep mine to save the life of a three-year-old child.

Ina Koenig emerged bruised, cold, wet and tearful from the chasm near Hanover, but rescued a little boy called Jannic who would have drowned had she not gone in after him.

She neither knew how deep the hole was or if she could rescue him. But she jumped in after him in a split second after he vanished into the earth.

She had to fight for both their lives as they ended up in deep water in the flooded shaft at Osterwald.

Her heroism has hit the front pages of newspapers across Germany and Chancellor Angela Merkel has sent her congratulations to the 37-year-old for her 'courage'.

Ina is to receive a bravery award from the state of Lower Saxony for her actions and has also been recommended already for the Federal Cross of Merit - Germany's highest civilian award for bravery.

For two hours, in the near freezing water, she kept the child’s head above the surface while she battled to stay afloat.

They clung to tree roots and bulges in the shaft that was just four and-a-half feet wide until firemen could eventually pull them free.

Rescuers said it was only the body heat of Jana that kept Jannic alive in the water. Colleagues of her’s on the surface looking after the 39 other children from the St. Nicolai Kindergarten on a day out called the police and fire service.

The shaft was constructed to bring light into a coal mine that closed down years ago. 

But the wooden planks meant to seal it off from the workings deep underground had rotted.

Hidden in a copse of trees, Jannic plunged straight down - followed by his teacher.

Fire chief Dirk Habenicht said: 'We had to bring in a crane and lower men down the shaft.  We got the little boy into a belt first.  He wasn’t crying, just trembling a little.

'Then we got Ina into the belt and brought her up.  Both were only slightly injured.  The water was cold but it saved them; no water, and the fall would have killed them.'

Both were taken to the Hamelin-Pyrmont Sana Clinic where mild hypothermia was diagnosed and Jannic had bruises to his skin.  He is being kept in for observation for a week but she left the clinic after a check up.

Jannic is also to undergo counselling for the massive emotional trauma he suffered in the fall.

The mine began operating in the middle ages and closed down 100 years ago. The local authority said it tried to fill in the shaft on numerous occasions but it was too deep.  An inquiry is now underway as to why the rotting timber that covered its entrance was not replaced.

Ina refused to give interviews to local media, insisting: 'I am not a hero.I did what any human being would do.'
