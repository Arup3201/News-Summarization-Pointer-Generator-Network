Budweiser knows the way to sell beer is through a heartwarming inter-species friendship story featuring their famous Clydesdales. 

Last year their ad about a trainer being reunited with his horse was rated the number one Super Bowl ad by USA Today.

The beer company released their latest Super Bowl ad yesterday, which features the unlikely  friendship between a Clydesdale and a cute yellow Labrador puppy.

Escape: Budweiser's latest Super Bowl ad features an adorable puppy who enjoys spending time with horses instead of his own kind

Budweiser tugged at the heart strings with its cute tale of a puppy and his horse friend

Unlikely: The puppy and Clydesdale are best friends despite their different species

The puppy belongs to an adoption farm next door, but digs its way underneath the fence to visit his horse friends at the farm next door.

The owner of the horse farm is constantly having to return the rogue puppy who seems to think its a horse, rather than a dog.

But one day someone comes to adopt the puppy and he looks sad as he's put in the back seat of the car.

Sad to go: But one day the puppy is adopted and is ferried off the adoption farm by his new owner

Don't go! Seeing their canine friend leaving, the Clydesdales rush to action to stop the car

Where the dog belongs: The horses are able to stop the car and the last scene shows the puppy returned to the farm

Like the end of a romantic comedy, the puppy stares out the back window of the car as a group of Clydesdales chase after him.

The horses are able to stop the car and the last scene shows the puppy sauntering back up the driveway to the horse farm, where he belongs.       

The beer brand is also planning another advertisement to pay tribute to soldiers returning from Afghanistan.

The company has purchased a total of four minutes of ad time for this year's super bowl.

The rate for a 30 second spot is estimated to be $4million, meaning the beer brand shelled out more than $30million for the big game.
