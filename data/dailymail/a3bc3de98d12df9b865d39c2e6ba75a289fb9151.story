Jose Mourinho has rejected the idea that he might be in the transfer market for Borussia Dortmund striker Marco Reus.

Reus is refusing to sign an extension to contract at Dortmund and the 25-year-old is thought to be available in the summer for £20million, due to a clause in his current deal.

He has been ruled out with injury until the New Year but that has not quelled speculation linking him with Real Madrid and Chelsea, as well as other Barclays Premier League clubs.

Mourinho, however, arrived in Germany ahead of Chelsea's Champions League game against Schalke and said: 'We don't want Marco Reus. The market is closed and the player belongs to Borussia. We have top players in this position.

'No secrets, I have a fantastic relationship with the Dortmund coach and sporting director.'

Mourinho, meanwhile, has downplayed the significance of coming up against former Chelsea boss Roberto Di Matteo on Tuesday evening.

The Italian led the Blues to their only Champions League victory in 2012 and also enjoyed a successful six-year spell with the west London club as a player.

'Don't ask me to speak about him,' said Mourinho. 'The history is the history that he was on Chelsea bench when Chelsea won the Champions League. He is a historic name in this club. I have nothing more to say.

'My name is in the history of this club. A football club is made of many, many names not one or two names or one player or one manager.

'I did my history here and now I have the chance to make more history here and he was Chelsea manager and he did his history here. I won it twice. For Chelsea, zero.'
