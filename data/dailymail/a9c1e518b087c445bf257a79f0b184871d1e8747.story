The Ministry of Defence has paid out more than £2million to settle claims of sex abuse against youngsters in the cadet forces over the past three years, it has emerged.

The payments include both historic sex abuse of children who are now adults, as well as more recent cases, it was reported.

Cases include alleged sexual abuse in different arms of the cadets including the Army Cadets, Combined Cadet Force, and Air Cadets.

Five payments of nearly £1.5million were made in 2012, and payouts added up to nearly £65,000 in 2013

Freedom of Information requests revealed eight payments were made this year totalling more than £500,000.

Five payments of nearly £1.5million were made in 2012, and payouts added up to nearly £65,000 in 2013.

The information released by the MoD did not show which of the cadet groups were associated with the cases. No payments were made in 2011, according to the Guardian newspaper’s inquiries.

One reported case involved abuse carried out by teenagers on younger cadets, and another the rape of a female cadet who became pregnant and gave birth to a child.

A lawyer for several victims in the Army Cadets said abusers had exploited their positions of trust.

Rebecca Sheriff, from Bolt Burdon Kemp, said: ‘It is common practice for sex offenders to seek out positions of authority in organisations such as the Army Cadets, and vulnerable children need to be safeguarded from this risk.

‘It is terrible that often these children have joined the cadets with a view to a career in the armed services, which they are unable to pursue as a result of abuse by people that they should have been able to trust.’

The mother of one victim said her son was sexually abused by two older cadets. But despite a settlement of £23,000 she has yet to receive an apology.

The case was reported to the police but the alleged abusers were given only a warning. The woman, who was not named, said: ‘If something like that goes on and is not right then somebody needs to take responsibility, and the cadets [organisation] had to pay what they paid to compensate for all the hurt. But the two lads have got away with it, they just received warnings, and it was put on file. [The police] said it was bullying and intimidation of a sexual nature – because it wasn’t anything like a rape.’

She added: ‘I believe that they had been doing it for a while. It makes me sick and saddened inside. It really, really, does. I was told that the cadets had their own internal investigation but I’m not aware of what happened.’

In another case, a victim who was abused and then raped by a cadet instructor received £210,000.

A spokesman for the MoD said: ‘We take any allegation of abuse extremely seriously. All adult volunteers undergo enhanced criminal record checks and are made fully aware of their responsibility to protect children from harm.

‘Any suspicion of bullying, harassment or abuse will be dealt with immediately and any allegation of a criminal nature is handed to the police. This is reinforced throughout all safeguarding training.’

Earlier this month it was claimed the Scout Association has paid out nearly £900,000 in compensation over sex abuse charges.

Following the BBC report, the movement issued a formal apology, in which a spokesman admitted that it had tried to deal with paedophiles without telling police.
