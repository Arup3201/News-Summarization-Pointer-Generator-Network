A circus fire-eater suffered horrific burns when he burped in the middle of his act - setting his face alight in front of horrified fans.

Ilya Golubev was reaching the climax of his show in the Russian city of Izhevsk when he suddenly belched, showering his face in the paraffin he uses to spray flames.

Shocked witnesses saw his mouth burst into flames and the fire spreading out onto his face and hands as he desperately tried to beat it out.

Show-shocker: As Golubev turns round, he belches, showering his face in the paraffin he uses to spray flames

One spectator, Jamal Voronoff, said: 'We thought it was part of the show at first until we saw the look in his eyes and the way he was desperately trying to put out the fire.

'He was clearly in agony, but nobody came forward with a fire extinguisher to help him.

'He dropped his torch as he tried to beat out the flames.'

He even carried on for a short time in the spirit of performers that 'The Show Must Go On' before finally leaving in agony to get treatment.

Police say Golubev is recovering from burns in hospital.

Doctors said his injuries had been made worse by trying to continue with the show immediately after the incident, instead of putting water on his face.

Clinic spokesman Peter Bazarov said: 'The patient said he had accidentally expelled some of the fuel in his mouth involuntarily and it caught fire when he wasn't expecting it.'
