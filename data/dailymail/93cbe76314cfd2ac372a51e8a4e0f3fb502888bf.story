The political Twittersphere erupted into guffaws Saturday after a women's lifestyle magazine published a soft profile of ABC journalist Claire Shipman – the wife of White House Press Secretary Jay Carney – and applied ham-fisted Photoshop edits to a photo of the family bookshelf.

Now it's not so empty.

The photograph shows Carney and Shipman standing in front of a briefing podium, miming the routine of a press conference by taking questions from their enthusiastic children. The bookshelf is situated behind them.

A dozen or more cut-and-paste operations later, 12-year-old Hugo Carney's left pinky finger wound up halfway across the room, left behind when a book jacket was cloned.

That's just the most obvious edit.

Carney, Shipman and their children staged a mock press conference for Washingtonian MOM magazine, in front of a bookshelf that included a copy of 'Soviet Architecture' (next to the Gorbachev bobblehead, 4th shelf R)

Amateur Twitter sleuths tore the image apart on Saturday, mocking the horrible Photoshop job which left Americans with the impression that president Obama's spokesman isn't well-read enough to have a sizable library of his own (note the extra finger, 2nd shelf R)

MailOnline found 12 separate Photoshop edits, each involving replacing a blank space with a book, leaving readers with the impression that Carney and Shipman are better-read than they actually are.

Have you seen this finger? This is what happens when bad Photoshoppers attack

Carney's office didn't respond to a request for comment. Neither did Washingtonian MOM magazine, which published the story, titled 'Balancing Act.'

A journalist who has visited Carney's home in a wealthy neighborhood of Washington, D.C. told MailOnline that the home isn't bereft of reading material, and it would have been easy to find enough books to fill the shelf instead of faking it later.

Shipman, in fact, told the magazine some of her favorite things to read, including 'A Wrinkle in Time' and 'Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman.'

'I always have a pile,' she said. 'I hate to be without books. Knowing I have a bunch makes me happy. A good book and a good chocolate bar!'

Or several identical good books.

Washingtonian MOM snapped this cover shot of the Carney-SHipman kitchen, and an astute New Hampshire convention-goer spotted the red Soviet-propaganda artwork (next to Ms. Shipman)

Attendees of the New Hampshire 
Freedom Summit guffawed at the sight of Carney and Shipman's suddenly 
multiplying book collection.

Carney art: Dmitry Moor's famous poster asked 'Have You Enlisted In the Army?' and challenged Russian workers about their commitment to the October Revolution and the Soviet communist party

'That's about right,' quipped a woman from Concord who said her name was Judith. 'Phony books, phony answers, phony White House. Anyone surprised?'

Her husband squinted at a laptop and pointed to a book positioned between a Russian matryoshka doll and a Mikhail Gorbachev bobble-head.

'Does that say "Soviet Architecture?" he asked. 'It does,' doesn't it?'

Mike, another conservative in attendance at Saturday's cattle call for Republican presidential hopefuls, spotted a poster in the Carney-Shipman kitchen – shown in another Washingtonian MOM picture – that's a take-off on Soviet propaganda art.

'I know that picture,' said the visitor from Nashua. 'The original Russian poster asked, "Have you volunteered?" It's sort of like "Uncle Sam Wants YOU," only for communists.'

Right-wing Twitter denizens rocketed the bookshelf photo around the Internet on Saturday, alternatively taking and sharing credit for the discovery that the image was heavily edited. Twitchy, a popular best-of-Twitter feed, collected the snark.

The mocking grew loudest when young Hugo's duplicate pinky was discovered.

'OMG. They even forgot to erase the kid's finger in the fake book Photoshop,' read one tweet.

'Pfft! Like YOU don't use kids' fingers for bookends,' came a reply.

Red-meat conservatives on hand in New Hampshire 
to see right-wing luminaries like Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (L) and Texas 
Sen. Ted Cruz (R) chuckled at the wayward images of Jay Carney's 
Washington, D.C. home

One picture shows the pair miming a playful press conference where they field questions from their two young children

The bookshelf backdrop wasn't full enough, so the mag Photoshopped duplicates, including one that left an extra finger belonging to Carney's son

Conservatives cackled at the idea that Carney might not be well-read enough to have a full library without faking the picture

Attendees at the NH Freedom Summit guffawed and then noticed what looks like a Soviet propaganda poster hanging in Carney's kitchen
