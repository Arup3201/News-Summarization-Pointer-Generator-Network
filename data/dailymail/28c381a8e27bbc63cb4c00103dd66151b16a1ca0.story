Temple University in Philadelphia has canceled its annual Spring Fling after 'high-risk' drinking at the event caused serious concerns.

The college sent an email to all students on Monday. The decision also came after a 19-year-old student fell 40 feet to her death from an off-campus, rooftop party during Spring Fling in April.

Ali Fausnaught, of Brownstown, 
Pennsylvania, was apparently posing for a photograph on the flat roof of an apartment block, which has no guard rail and only a
ten-inch ledge.

The university sent an email to all students saying that the social event would no longer take place but made no mention of Miss Fausnaught, according to philly.com.

VP of student affairs Theresa Powell told college newspaper Temple News that while Miss Fausnaught's death was shocking, it was not the reason that Spring Fling had been canceled.

Ms Powell said: 'Her death was extremely tragic and just a shock. But she is not the reason for this move.

'It was just the culture that this is now a day to drink and that was most disturbing to us.'

The 19-year-old's death was ruled accidental and not directly linked to drinking. The teenager plunged three stories into an alley behind the property.

Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Scott Small said there were around 30 to 40 people at the apartment on North 18th Street, just four blocks west of Temple University's campus

Miss Fausnaught was a freshman at 
West 
Chester, having recently transferred from University of South Carolina. 
She was visiting her boyfriend, who attends Temple, when the accident 
occurred.

Fausnaught was  majoring in psychology. She graduated from Conestoga Valley High School in 2012.

At the time of the student's 
death, Philadelphia police Officer Tanya Little said: 'She was backing 
up and tripped over the edge and fell backward.'

Spring Fling is an annual event at 
Temple that features 200 vendors, games, giveaways and music. It is also
the day of many student parties.

The university said in the email that it was working on an event with a different feel.
