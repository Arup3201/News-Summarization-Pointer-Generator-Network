Tragedy: Emma Hopwood, who friends and family said drank every day, died after falling down the stairs at her home in Stockport, Greater Manchester

An alcoholic mother-of-three died when she fell down the stairs at her home while drinking alone.

Emma Hopwood, 30, was found by her estranged partner.

The former barmaid, who friends said was once a ‘yummy mummy’, started binge drinking as an 18-year-old, an inquest heard.

Although she had three children, her drunken nights out escalated into all-day drinking bouts fuelled by huge amounts of cheap cider.

Her best friend Debra Walters told the hearing: ‘She was someone who drank from when she woke up to when she went to sleep.’

Last June she fell backwards down stairs at her home and suffered a fatal double fracture of the skull.

Tests showed she was more than three times the drink-drive limit and police found many empty cider cans and drink crates at the house.

Last night her mother Janet Maher, 48, warned of the dangers of binge drinking – and said parents should take action.

She said: ‘Parents of young people who drink too much need look for the signs and give them a lot of love and affection.

'The way my daughter died could happen to anyone young lady who drinks too much alcohol for her own good.

'She started drinking when she was a teenager when she used to go out to the pub with her friends like most girls her age. But despite liking a drink she used to get up and go to work - she wasn't drunk every day.

'But it escalated during her relationship
 with the father of her children and she would drink to blot it out. In 
later life she would phone me sometimes and I could tell she had had a 
drink because she was slurring her words.

'She always drank cheap cider and she 
used to hide empty cans. She would hide them in cupboards, in the 
laundry basket, in the toilet cistern, under the bed, in bags, in 
handbags.

'She used to go 
upstairs quite a lot and that was a sign that she was drinking. Later I 
would find empty cans in the bedrooms. Parents should encourage their 
children to get professional help. You have to keep on top of it.

Troubled:  The 30-year-old mother-of-three had struggled to cope with her alcohol problem since she was 18, her inquest heard

'We
 tried to help her as much as we could but sometimes we couldn't get 
through to her but other people, like counsellors, could get through to 
her.

'I had to hide all the drink in the house. Towards the end I don't know how many cans of cider she was drinking.

'She
 was very good at putting a happy face on but I did worry about her. But
 then my worst nightmare happened. If I could, I would change with her 
in a heartbeat.'

This
 week, experts said the number of women aged 34 and under dying from 
alcohol-related conditions, such as liver disease, has more than doubled
 since the 1980s.

Such deaths are now falling in young men – but rising among young women.

The inquest heard Miss Hopwood, of Stockport, Greater Manchester, didn’t drink during pregnancy.

But she split with her children’s father Barry Shepherd after drunken and violent rows.

In
 his statement to the inquest, in Sale, Mr Shepherd said: ‘She was lying
 at the bottom of the stairs with her feet going up the stairs.

'She had 
blood on her nose.’

He 
added: ‘When I first saw her I was ready to say: “Get off the floor, you
 silly devil.”

'She looked like she had just sprawled out at the bottom 
of the stairs.’

A postmortem examination confirmed that Miss Hopwood had two fractures to her skull and had died as a result of a injury, where the brain moves to opposite side of the skull that was impacted.

Dr 
Naomi Carter said Miss Hopwood would have been unsteady on her feet with a blood alcohol level of 259mg per 100ml.

Coroner John Pollard recorded an open verdict.
