A 75-year-old man helped in the arrest of a shoplifting suspect at a Pennsylvania mall by tackling him and threatening to break his arm if he tried to escape.

Charlie Burton, of Fombell, says he was a vendor at the Washington Crown Center mall for a gun show when he saw an officer struggling with the suspect, 29-year-old Jonathan Fekete Jr.

Police say Fekete was trying to get away after taking $200 worth of clothes from a Macy's store Saturday.

Still got it: Charlie Burton, of Fombell, says he was a vendor at the Washington Crown Center mall for a gun show when he saw an officer struggling with the suspect, 29-year-old Jonathan Fekete Jr., and jumped in to help

Suspect Jonathan Fekete Jr., 29, was tackled by Burton after allegedly taking $200 worth of clothes from a Macy's store Saturday at a mall where a gun show was being held

Burton says he ran over to help, grabbed the man's arms and forced him down. Burton says, 'He started hollering his arm hurt, and I said, 'Quit struggling or I'll break the thing.''

Burton told the Observer-Reporter:

'It happened so quickly...I just grabbed his arm and started twisting it. The security guard had him by the other arm and was trying to take him down.

'It was quite a tangle with the fella because he was so strong. I don't think anyone could've taken him down by themselves...He kept telling me to stop twisting his arm. I wonder what he'd do if he knew one of the people he was tussling with was twice his age.' 

In attendance at the gun show north of Pittsburgh was state Senator Camera Bartolotta, who commended Burton on her Facebook.

'I have to give a huge shout-out to Charlie (or Super Charlie!)' she wrote. 

'How dumb do you have to be to shoplift in a mall completely packed with sportsmen?' the lawmaker wondered. 'Half the people in the mall were packing.'

Fekete is jailed. Court records don't list an attorney.

However, the Bellaire, Ohio man, it turned out, had one outstanding Pennsylvania warrant in connection with an Allegheny County drug charge.

Of course, Burton had no way to know anything about Fekete.

'My wife asked me if I was nuts,' Burton said. 'But I would have felt bad if the officer got hurt.'
