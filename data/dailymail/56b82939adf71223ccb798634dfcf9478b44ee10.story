Michelle Obama wore a $55 dress to mark the first day of her summer vacation, proving once again that she's not afraid to mix up her wardrobe with budget-friendly picks.

The First Lady arrived in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, with her husband on August 10 wearing a chic rose-print design which is currently on sale down from $169 to $55.99 at Talbots.

A spokesperson for the classic womenswear label told MailOnline that her outing helped to boost sales and now the item is close to selling out with only a U.S. size 20 left in stock.

She also wore the sunny frock to give her final official pre-vacation speech at 
the Disabled American Veterans convention in Orlando, Florida, choosing to accessorize it with pearls and a waist belt.

When she reappeared later in the afternoon exiting a government aircraft she ditched both and donned over-sized sunglasses for a more off duty look.

She also swapped nude kitten heels for a comfortable pair of caramel-colored pumps as she headed off for her annual coastal break.

It isn't the first time Michelle Obama has stepped out in Talbots attire. 

This April at the annual White House 
Easter open day she wore a seersucker blazer which she debuted at the 2012 London Olympics.

She also wore a blue flowered dress from the brand on the cover of a 2009 issue of Essence magazine triggering record orders.

Explaining her approach to fashion she previously told reporters: 'I don't buy a designer, I buy a dress. I buy the thing that looks good.  

'It's really just sort of, how cold is 
it? Do I have to stand outside, and what am I going to use to cover my 
arms if I'm freezing so I'm not shivering while I have to give a speech?
 It's really stuff like that.

Sell-out success: The yellow floral-print Talbots dress is now only available in a U.S. size 20

'And I know people are sort of thinking that it's different, but it's real practical stuff like that.'

The Obamas returned from their eight-day vacation this Sunday.

During their time away the family of four stayed at the luxury four-bedroom Chilmark House designed by architect Rick Sundberg.

With wall-to-ceiling windows, the 5,000sq ft, $7.6 million property has stunning views over the ocean, as well as an infinity pool, tennis courts and a half basketball court.
