Jacqui Lambie, Palmer United Party senator, told radio listeners her ideal man was rich and 'well hung'

Senator Jacqui Lambie caused shock on the airwaves this morning, telling listeners that she wanted a man with 'a package between their legs' and asking a 22-year-old caller if he was 'well-hung'.

The Palmer United Party senator for Tasmania appeared on Heart 107.3 this morning where it was revealed she had not been in a relationship for 11 years.

Radio hosts Kim Napier and Dave Noonan offered to find her a love match and invited callers who wanted to date the senator to phone in.

Ms Lambie revealed her criteria for a man, saying: 'They must have heaps of cash and they've got to have a package between their legs, let's be honest.

'I don't need them to speak, they don't even need to speak.'

Ms Lambie has since apologised for her comments to a 22-year-old caller named Jamie, who was interested in dating the 43-year-old mother-of-two, though he did not seem to know who Ms Lambie was and sounded surprised to learn she was a federal senator.Â 

'A lot of people laughed ... (but) some people may have got offended,' she said in a statement.

Using a joke to cover the embarrassment of discussing her love life on a light-hearted radio segment would cause her political enemies to pounce.

'But the reality is I was talking with Kim and Dave on Heart FM, not Sarah Ferguson on the ABC.'

During the segment, Jamie said he fulfilled Ms Lambie's first criterion, having inherited 'a small fortune'.

Ms Lambie then expressed concern that at the age of 22, Jamie might be inexperienced and 'might not be able to handle Jacqui Lambie', to which he replied 'I've been about a fair bit.'

Finally, Ms Lambie asked Jamie if he was 'well-hung'.

'Hung like a donkey,' he replied.

Ms Lambie then revealed that her 24-year-old son also believed he was hung like a donkey, before stating that her son 'would be cringing' at her comments.

The rookie senator caused a stir earlier this month when she told ABC radio that Tony Abbott was a 'political psychopath' who had put his daughters' lives in danger by 'parading' them for political gain on the campaign trail last year.

A few days after the controversial comments, Ms Lambie took another swipe at the prime minister, saying he needed 'a bucket of cement' to toughen up if he couldn't cop her criticism.

The comments attracted national media attention and Senator Lambie later apologised.
