A £25billion rival to the Panama Canal could be built across Nicaragua – funded entirely by the Chinese.

The hugely ambitious engineering project would give China control of a vital waterway to challenge the one completed by the US in Panama nearly 100 years ago.

Legislation paving the way for a new canal was given the go-ahead by Nicaraguan politicians on Monday night and is expected to be approved by the National Assembly tomorrow.

A concession to build a canal across Nicaragua linking the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea, likely to go through the waters of Lake Nicaragua, are expected to be awarded to a Chinese company

Five of the six proposed routes for the new canal pass through the giant Lake Nicaragua

The canal would cross the Central 
American country – one of the poorest in the region – from the Caribbean
 coast in the east to the Pacific coast in the west.

It would thus compete directly with 
the 48-mile Panama Canal  further south which gives ships a fast route 
between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

About 130 miles of waterway would 
have to be dug, and 40,000 construction jobs could be created over the 
11 years estimated for completion, according to the project’s 
supporters.

When finished, they believe it could 
capture 4.5 per cent of world maritime freight traffic and double 
Nicaragua’s per capita gross domestic product.

A China-based consortium would 
finance the construction in return for a majority share in earnings from
 the potentially lucrative new shipping route.

Daniel Ortega, Nicaragua’s socialist president, is backing the waterway enthusiastically.

But many outside observers and Ortega
 opponents point out that nearly every key detail remains a mystery, 
from the exact sources of the funding to Nicaragua’s share of the 
profits and the precise route.

Critics have also been asking whether
 Central America needs two canals, even in an age of growing world 
trade. Panama’s is already being expanded to take bigger ships.

Feasibility studies have indicated 
six potential routes across Nicaragua, many connecting with Lake 
Nicaragua in the west, but the legislation does not indicate which one 
would be dug.

The government plans to grant the 
Chinese HK Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Co Ltd a concession 
for an initial 50 years, with the possibility of extending it another 
50.

Construction of a Nicaraguan canal 
would mark the end of a saga dating back to the 19th century when US 
shipping and railroad magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt won the right to 
build a waterway across the country but gave up amid political turmoil.

Other US interests then studied 
building a canal in Nicaragua before settling on Panama where an attempt
 by the French to build a canal had ended in failure. The US took over 
and completed the job in 1914.

The canal was owned by the US until 1999 when it was handed over to the Panamanian government.

A second waterway linking the Atlantic with the Pacific has long been in the planning, however.

The steady increase in shipping since the opening of the Panama Canal means there is plenty of financial incentive.

And with the emergence of China as a 
resource-hungry economic superpower, the route is now  more likely than 
ever to become  a reality.

Jaime Incer, an environmentalist and 
adviser to the presidency on environmental issues, said authorities 
should be defining a specific route for the canal before approving a 
concession.

'There are at 
least six proposed routes and five of them include Lake Nicaragua, but 
there is nothing definite, that's all part of the unknown,' he said.

Deputy
 Foreign Minister Manuel Coronel, who is chairman of the country's Grand
 Canal Authority, said Monday that he had no doubt the Chinese company 
would carry out the project.

When the 48-mile long Panama Canal was finally finished in 1914 it was described as the 'eighth wonder of the world' and observers said it would have an impact akin to 'shifting the nations on a map'.

The international waterway allowed ships to pass between the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean,
 saving about 8,000 miles from a journey around the southern 
tip of South America, Cape Horn.

The canal makes the trip from the east coast to the west coast of the U.S. much shorter than the route taken around the tip of South America prior to 1914.

Though traffic continues to increase through the canal, many oil supertankers and military battleships and aircraft carriers can not fit through the canal. There's even a class of ships known as Panamax, those built to the maximum capacity of the Panama canal and its locks.

It takes approximately fifteen hours to traverse the canal through its three sets of locks (about half the time is spent waiting due to traffic).

Ships passing through the canal from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean actually move from the northwest to the southeast, due to the east-west orientation of the Isthmus of Panama.

'It's
 a very serious company, very responsible and recognized,' Coronel said.
 'To doubt (the company) is to oppose the project for political rather 
than realistic issues.'

The
 Hong Kong-registered company has said that it is willing to fully study
 the technological, economic, environmental and social impact of the 
project.

'This is a great 
project that has the potential to transform international trade and 
bring significant economic and social benefits to Nicaragua, their 
neighbors and Latin America,' company spokesman Ronald Maclean-Abaroa 
said Monday on the group's website.

Under the deal, the Chinese company would pay Nicaragua $10million annually during the first decade, then pay it a share of canal revenues - an amount that would begin at 1 per cent and rise to an unspecified percentage over the life of the concession. After completing the concession, the Chinese company would have to turn over to Nicaragua all buildings and other canal infrastructure.

Jose Aguerri, who heads an association of Nicaraguan chambers of commerce, said the lack of details released about the project would slow investment.

'Until you define the path that the canal will have, it will be difficult to attract investment to the area because there is no legal certainty,' Aguirre said after meeting with committee members.

Another Hong Kong-based company has been operating port facilities on both ends of the Panama Canal.

The Nicaraguan canal's construction would mark the end of a long push that began at least as far back as the 19th century when U.S. industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt won the right to build a waterway across the country but gave up amid political turmoil.

Other U.S. interests then studied building a canal in Nicaragua before settling on Panama as the crossing point.

Panama is nearing the end of a seven-year, $5.2billion expansion project to allow bigger ships to use its waterway. That project is scheduled to be finished next year.
