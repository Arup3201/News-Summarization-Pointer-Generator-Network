Zola Tongo, 34, who is serving an 18-year term, was giving evidence in the trial of Shrien Dewani, who is accused of arranging the murder of his wife

The taxi driver who is in jail for the murder of newlywed Anni Dewani in South Africa claims he fitted child locks on his car to prevent her escaping, a South African court has been told.

Zola Tongo, 34, who is serving an 18-year term, was giving evidence in the trial of Shrien Dewani, a bisexual entrepreneur from Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol.

Dewani has pleaded not guilty to murder, kidnap, robbery with aggravating circumstances, conspiracy to commit these crimes and defeating the ends of justice at Western Cape High Court in Cape Town.

Dewani claims the couple were hijacked as Tongo was driving them through Gugulethu township in his minibus on November 13.

He was released unharmed and Anni was driven away. She was found shot dead in the abandoned minibus the next morning.

It is alleged he arranged the murder of his wife through Tonga.

The information concerning the child locks, which prevent a passenger in the rear of the car from leaving, was not in Tongo's original statement, and the driver told the court he had only just remembered it.

Dewani's defence lawyer Francois van Zyl said: 'You engaged the child locks.'

Tongo said: 'Correct'

Van Zyl added: 'That means the accused wouldn't be able to get out.'

Tongo added: 'Correct. But I knew they (the gunmen) would do nothing to the accused person.'

The court also heard it was 'strange' the taxi driver did not ask Dewani when he would be paid for killing the businessman's wife.

Van Zyl had tried to find out what arrangements  Tongo allegedly made with his client regarding a 5,000 rand (£283) payment for Anni Dewani's murder on Saturday November 13 2010.

According to the prosecution, Dewani's secret gay life and the reputation of his family motivated him to order the contract killing of his new bride, Anni, 28, pictured above, during their honeymoon to South Africa

Tongo said during cross-examination he and Dewani spoke about his commission the day the couple landed in Cape Town, and was told the murder needed to happen the next day.

He said he could not remember discussing how he would be paid, which Mr Van Zyl said he found strange because Tongo had described the payment as important. He added he did not know how long Dewani would be in the country.

Mr van Zyl said: 'For all you knew, he could have left Cape Town on Sunday morning. You made no arrangements with him as to when and how you would be paid.'

After more questions, it was revealed Tongo did not ask about the alleged commission when he and Dewani were sitting together at the Cape Grace Hotel on Sunday morning, hours before Anni's body was found. Tongo said he did not ask because the hotel was busy.

The information concerning the child locks, which prevent a passenger in the rear of the car (pictured) from leaving, was apparently not in Tongo's original statement

Mr van Zyl asked Tongo if he tried to get in contact with Dewani before he left the country the following Tuesday. Tongo said he did not.

Mr van Zyl said it was only through coincidence that the pair spoke, when Tongo phoned a police officer to complain about journalists bothering him.

Tongo did not realise Dewani was in the officer's company. Dewani asked the officer if he could speak to Tongo over the phone.

Asked again why Tongo did not try to get hold of Dewani, he eventually said he did not have his contact number.

When it was pointed out to him that nothing prevented him from phoning Dewani's hotel, Tongo said he had not thought of that.

The prosecution alleges Dewani conspired with others to stage the hijacking in return for 15,000 rand (£847). Anni Dewani's body was found in Tongo's abandoned shuttle taxi in Khayelitsha on Sunday November 14, 2010.

Middleman Monde Mbolombo, a hotel receptionist, was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for testifying against his accomplices.

Xolile Mngeni is serving life in jail for firing the shot that killed Anni, but died in prison from a brain tumour on October 18.

Mziwamadoda Qwabe is serving a 25-year jail term.
