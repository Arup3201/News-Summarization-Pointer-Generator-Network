A 62-year-old man had a miracle escape after he survived being crushed by a flaming 80ft  tree which was set on fire by a group of campers.

Jon Rixon had been enjoying a morning stroll through the woods near Shrewsbury in Shropshire when he was buried underneath the huge 6.5 tonne oak.

He broke his shoulder and several ribs after being struck by the heavy branches when the burning tree fell on a footpath at around 10am on Sunday.

The RAF veteran was flown to hospital after being discovered in agony by passing cyclist Richard Pugh at Haughmond Hill.

The collapse is believed to have been caused by a group of campers who had decided to start a fire in the hollow base of the tree.

Today, wife Suzi Rixon said her husband, a father of six,  was lucky to be alive and slammed the 'irresponsible' actions of the campers.

The 56-year-old, from Upper Battlefied, Shropshire, said: 'Jon has got a broken shoulder and several broken ribs but he is very lucky to be alive.

'He saw the smoke coming from the tree and he heard this almighty crack.

'He was able to run but with conditions being so muddy he was not able to get away entirely. 

'If he had stayed where he was he might not be here today.

'I am just furious about the irresponsibility of the campers that set fire to the tree. It is just beyond belief.

'I think people need to be aware of the consequences of such reckless actions.

'It's shocking. I am so horrified. Setting fire to an enormous oak tree is beyond ridiculous. I am very angry about it. I'm so hugely grateful to Richard. He's an absolute star.

'Lots of people have been ringing up to see how Jon is. He was in a huge amount of pain and he's on morphine and antibiotics to make sure he doesn't get pneumonia.'

Mr Pugh, 51, from, Shrewsbury, added: 'I was two thirds of the way along the path when I came across this guy sat on the side looking distressed. I said "are you OK?"

'And he said "no not really". I asked what happened and he said "this tree has just fallen on top of me".

'He said as he heard a crack he ran a little bit but it had pummelled him into the floor. He said he had managed to crawl out from underneath.

'Another lady turned up and she had been not far away when it had happened so she had seen the aftermath.

'It was evident he was in quite a lot of pain and he was going into shock as he was going whiter.

They quickly realised they were not going to be able to move him to the road themselves and eventually an air ambulance helicopter was dispatched to the scene.

'In the meantime the tree was roaring away,' Mr Pugh added.

'It was the biggest tree - around about 80ft tall and about 14ft across at some points.'

Jon was flown to Royal Shrewsbury Hospital by the Midlands Air Ambulance where he remained in a stable condition today.

A spokesperson for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'We were called just after 10am to reports of a man being hit by a tree.

'By the time we arrived it appears the man had crawled from under the tree and a man in his 60s was treated at the scene.

'He was given pain relief at the scene and airlifted to Royal Shrewsbury Hospital.

'An ambulance and a rapid response paramedic attended the scene.'

Steve Morris, crew manager for Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'The tree had a hollow trunk and the fire started in there.

'The fire had burned and weakened the tree itself and caused it to fall down across the path. Our problem was getting access and water to it.

'It would have been burning I suspect for a period of about 12 hours.

He said crews spent more than three hours at the scene and used a pumping appliance and an off road vehicle to get water to the tree. 

'Ambulance crews were there to deal with the casualty prior to our arrival,' he added.

'As with all outdoor fires we would discourage people from lighting fires outside in woodland because they can catch on so quickly and it is very difficult to put them out once they have started and they are away from the road making it difficult for us to get to them.'
