A staple in most kitchen cupboards since the 1950s, Heinz Baked Beans have been around for a while.

It's easy to see how the brand has changed advertising tactics to remain popular among British households after 60 years of success.

Heinz has attempted to capture the mood of the nation at every turn by homing in on family dynamics at tea time.

1950s commercials attempted to remind hard pushed housewives of the money they were saving when buying Heinz Beanz to feed their families

In the advert released in 1955, viewers are offered a recipe for 'Scotch Beans'

Ever since the 1950s Heinz has tried to establish itself as a household name, featuring mothers and their children in their many adverts

The first television commercial in 
1955 gently reminded frugal housewives of the beans' value for money, 
with wartime mentalities rationing and waste still at the forefront of 
people's minds.

The
black and white advert for the then new recipe, 'Scotch Beans', 
promised busy mums an easy way to make diverse and tasty meals for their
households.

The advert reassures viewers: 'You know they're good because they're Heinz'.

Beanz meanz Heinz: A more upbeat advert in the 1960s played on the nation's relaxed mood

'So good to grow up with': The sixties commercial played to children's interests, promising a tasty treat good enough to stay home for

Highlighting how mothers across the country are providing the fuel to help kids grow up great, eighties ads played on the trend for ambition and success and once again ensured the relevance of Heinz Beanz at dinner tables

The decade of glamour, power and high aspirations, saw Heinz launch some of its most iconic adverts to date

The 
swinging sixties brought about an upbeat change in mood, prompting Heinz
into creating an equally optimistic advert which insists the beans are 
'so good to grow up with'.

The
advert shows an older sister lightheartedly teasing her younger brother
who plans to leave home on a round the world trip, before being enticed
to the dinner table by the sight and smell of Heinz Baked Beans.

The
more sophisticated seventies encouraged diners to look to more exotic 
types of cuisine, to which the Heinz Beanz responded with a series of 
print advertisements called 'Exoticz!'.

An explosion of technology and new developments enabled the country to move into a new century with more emphasis placed on speed and convenience

Demonstrating the changing family unit and their need for speed, Heinz Beanz Snap Pots were launched in a new TV ad which traced the parallel lives of four characters on a multi-split screen

The campaign sought to show the public how baked beans could be used to create interesting, foreign cuisine.

The
‘Kev’ commercial of the 80s captured two siblings sitting down together
at tea time, with older brother Kev delighting in his seniority and 
knowledge as he teasingly eats all his little brother’s Heinz Beanz.

The nineties zoomed in on the lives of working mothers who struggle juggling their roles at home and in the workplace.

The five a day advert promises children more energy, playing on Jack and the Beanstalk to deem their beans magic

The noughties carried on the tradition of featuring British kitchens at tea time with the '5 a day commercial'

The turn of the century sparked a new 
craze of convenient, microwavable foods and saw the birth of the Heinz 
snap pot- yogurt shaped containers which were easy to heat, keep and 
eat.

A decade later and
in light of the economic troubles recent years, Heinz reverted to 
similar tactics used in the 1950s to remind mothers of the good value, 
nutritious benefits of baked beans.

The company played on popular children's story, Jack and the Beanstalk, to hint at the beans' magic properties.

The
most recent advert doesn't stray too far from tradition, profiling two 
brothers whose playful arguments come to a heartwarming end once a plate
of beans on toast is placed in front of them.
