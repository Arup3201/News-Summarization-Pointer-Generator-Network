Manchester United are interested in Feyenoord’s teenage midfielder Tahith Chong.

The 15-year-old impressed club scouts while playing for the Dutch side at the Premier Cup tournament which was held at United’s Carrington training complex last month.

Chong, who can also play as a striker, has represented his country at Under 16 level and is tipped to be one of the next big stars to emerge from Feyenoord’s highly-productive youth academy.

United boss Louis van Gaal is also Dutch, and is keen on giving young players a chance

He is fast, technically good and scores goals. United have invited him over for training to take a closer look and with the hope of convincing him to join.

Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has been keen to stress that despite United’s £150million summer outlay on first team players they still intend to invest in youth. 

They have signed 16-year-old defender Timothy Fosu-Mensah from Ajax and are keen on Stromsgodset midfielder Martin Odegaard, 15, who has already been capped by Norway at full international level.
