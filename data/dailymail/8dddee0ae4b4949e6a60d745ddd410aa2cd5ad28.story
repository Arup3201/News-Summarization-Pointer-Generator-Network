A Chinese model enthusiast has built a real-life Batmobile - for just £7,000.

Businessman Li Weilei, 26, painstakingly put together the two-ton model with four mechanics in a quiet residential workshop in Shanghai.

The remarkable replica is almost identical to Bruce Wayne's wheels in the Dark Knight trilogy, with just one crucial difference - it doesn't have an engine.

Scrapheap challenge: One of the mechanics puts the finishing touches to 26-year-old Li Weilei's remarkable Batmobile replica. The model cost just £7,000 to make, though there is one hitch - it doesn't have an engine

Instead the enthusiasts have had to move their creation about using a professional scrapyard hoist.

The five friends put together the model at a workshop in the Minhang district, where photos of the creation alongside cyclists and passers-by quickly went viral online.

They saved money at every turn, spending just 70,000 yuan (£7,100) and hand-polishing the bodywork to save cash.

With extensive experience in prop 
design and talent in cutting and soldering, they made the whole model from 10 tons of scrap metal in two months.

They have now made a series of the cars, Li said.

'We've built a 
dozen Batman's cars,' he added. 'Two of them are in Shanghai, while the rest are on 
display in other parts of the country.'

Police officer Feng Dohan said: 'It is quite amazing - not the sort of vehicle you want to give a ticket to'

Unreal: The futuristic model cut an unusual figure 'parked' next to normal cars in residential Shanghai

Huge: The low-slung car is more than 10ft wide with rear wheels almost half as tall as a grown person

Feng Dohan, a police officer who 
took photos of the car, said: 'We have had a lot of enquiries, but I hate to 
disappoint fans.The vehicle is actually a life-size model of Batman's 
futuristic car.

'It is quite amazing though - not the sort of vehicle 
you want to give a ticket to.'

The low-slung car is more
 than 10ft wide with rear wheels almost half as tall as a 
grown person.

Their model is almost a hundred times cheaper than a fully-functioning 'Tumbler' Batmobile which went on sale earlier this year.

Just one of five replicas built, it featured a 5.7-litre V8 engine and 44-inch tyres and is completely street legal.

That's more than can be said for Li's model - and there's one other hitch, too.

For copyright reasons his car is not a Batmobile, nor has it ever been called one.

Labour of love: The enthusiasts spend two months putting together the model with 10 tones of scrap metal

Helpless: Because the car has no engine, they had to lift it off the ground using a scrapyard hoist
