Leeza Ormsby, an Australian resident, has spent the last three months locked up on the Indonesian island of Bali on drug charges.

On Tuesday, the 37-year-old was charged with possession of marijuana after half a hashish cigarette weighing 0.3 grams was found in her purse back in February.

The New Zealand-born woman was reportedly very distressed, and told reporters outside her cell that she wishes to see her family and 'I just want to go home.'

Transferred: The New Zealander was originally held in Denpasar city police jail but was moved to Kerobokan for the duration of her trial

Ormsby is likely to be sent home within months, as Bali police confirmed on Tuesday they had completed their investigation into the single charge, and handed her portfolio to prosecutors.

She was caught after police reportedly received a tip-off, and has spent the past few months in Denpasar at the city police jail.

Ormsby has recently been transferred to Kerobokan prison, where she will stay for the duration of her trial.

More charges: Ormsby could face  further possession charges if more evidence comes to light about drugs found in this villa

The Daily Telegraph report that prosecutor Ni Luh Putu Oika Ariani said investigators didn't have enough evidence to prove that an additional 132.2 grams of MDMA and 26.06 grams of hashish found inside a Bali villa at the same time belonged to Ormsby.

However if more evidence comes to light, the Sydney resident could face a sentence of up to 12 years for these primary charges, plus a secondary charge for personal use which carries four years.

Ormsby's lawyer Ary Soenardi said the defense he was preparing was based solely on the evidence involving the half-smoked joint.

The lawyer: Ormsby's representative Ary Soenardi said he will prepare his case based only on the 0.3 grams of hashish found on the woman, pictured here addressing media in February following Ormsby's arrest

'She didn't buy the joint, it was given to her by somebody she met at the beach the day before her arrest. She can't remember if she smoked it or not ... and she can't remember who the person was. It was another foreigner,' Mr Soenardi said according to The Sydney Morning Herald.

The only Australian-based woman now in Kerobokan jail, Ormsby is not the first local female to have seen the inside of the notorious jail.

Released on parole earlier this year, Australian Schapelle Corby spent almost a decade there for smuggling drugs into the Bali, though she still maintains they were planted in her boogie board bag back in 2005.
