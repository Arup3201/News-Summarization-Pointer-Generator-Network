Saturday is a big day for the Mertesackers, and not just for Arsenal defender Per. His brother Timo will also wake up in huge anticipation today.

‘My brother goes on the Arsenal away trips, just to improve his English and get on with away fans,’ said Per.

‘He loves it and, when he has time, he comes over for away games. He is with a group from Germany, everyone is really excited. They also came for the semi-final.

‘I said “If you want to come to the final you have to come to the semi first”.’

This Wembley clash will be particularly poignant for the Mertesacker brothers given Per is yet to play in a final of a club competition after an ankle injury robbed him of a place in the Werder Bremen team for the 2009 German Cup and Uefa Cup showpieces.

‘At that time we played Hamburg in the semi-final of the German Cup and Uefa Cup,’ said the 29-year-old.

‘We beat them in the German Cup and I scored against them. We went to Hamburg again in the Uefa Cup second leg and I got injured so I missed two finals. That was not a nice feeling.’

Timo shouldn’t be alarmed or insulted should the Gunners’ faithful break into a rendition of their now infamous song about his brother.

‘Big f****** German, he’s just a big f****** German,’ is likely to echo at Wembley today if Mertesacker scores as he did in the semi-final against Wigan.

Fan favourite: Mertersacker has become popular with the Arsenal faithful thanks to his calm displays

After a slow start to his career in north London, the giant defender has established himself as one of Arsene Wenger’s main men and a firm crowd favourite.

But he admits his cult status — and THAT chant — has taken him by surprise.

‘I was frightened when I first heard the chant because of the ‘F’ word,’ said the Germany international.

‘You can’t say that on TV. It was always a bit weird but a German journalist told me they quite like you. My first impression on that was not good but finally I got it. So it looks like we like each other.’

They’ll like him even more tonight if Mertesacker can help Arsenal end their nine- year trophy drought.
