Baby-faced killer: Aza Ray Vidinhar, 16, has pleaded guilty to two counts of murder, admitting that he intentionally and knowingly stabbed his two younger brothers to death last spring

A 16-year-old boy from Utah has pleaded guilty to two counts of murder, admitting that he intentionally and knowingly stabbed his two younger brothers to death last year.

Aza Ray Vidinhar agreed to a deal Wednesday in a court in Farmington that calls for him to serve time for one count of murder in juvenile detention until he turns 21. After that, he'll be transferred into the adult court system to serve time for the second count of murder on a sentence that could be as long as life or as short as a few months.

Vidinhar was calm, stoic and spoke in a deep voice during consecutive court hearings in juvenile and adult court where judges made sure he understood the conditions of the agreement.

The teenager did not say anything beyond responding to the judge's questions. But his attorney, Todd Utzinger, said Vidinhar is sorry for what happened and took the deal in part to spare his parents from having to endure a trial.

His parents were present at both hearings, but they left the court without talking to reporters.  His father wiped tears from his eyes while his mother sat in silence. Utzinger called it a somber day despite a deal that both the defense and prosecution, as well as the parents, agree is fair.

'They are in an impossible situation,' Utzinger said about the parents. 'They are trying to balance their love for Aza and their other children and how to handle an event of this magnitude. They just want an opportunity to move on privately with their lives.'

The murder case sent shockwaves last spring through the middle-class subdivision where the family lives in West Point, a city of 9,800 about 25 miles north of Salt Lake City.

Vidinhar's adopted younger brothers, Alex, 10, and Benjie, 4, were found dead in May 2013 when his mother returned home from taking another sibling to a dance recital.

At first, Aza was thought to be a third victim because he was missing from home, but police found him hours later spattered with blood.

Authorities said they believed the stabbings were an unplanned attack.

Utzinger declined to discuss what Vidinhar said about what happened that night. He also declined to discuss if Vidinhar has any mental illness.

In signing off on the deal, juvenile court Judge Janice Frost said the agreement adequately balances public safety needs while giving Vidinhar access to treatment and rehabilitation services in juvenile court that he needs.

Frost implored Vidinhar to take advantage of treatment he'll receive in juvenile detention and the opportunity to finish his high school degree. She said it's clear that he needs guidance and direction he would not receive in adult prison.

Frost told him multiple times that how he behaves in juvenile detention will impact how long he spends in state adult prison.

'You can't make up for what happened. But you can commit to doing better and being better,' Frost said. 'It's a sad thing that happened, but you can move forward from this. I hope you can take advantage of your opportunity.'

In their joint obituary, Alex was described as an outgoing and friendly boy who loved meeting new people and singing; his younger brother, Benjie, had a passion for trucks and hot wheels, but was the more reserved of the two.

On May 22, 2013, the two kids were left in the care of their older brother while their mother took her daughters to a dance recital, Desert News reported at the time.

The woman returned home in the afternoon with her three girls and discovered the body of 4-year-old Benjie. She called 911, thinking that Alex and Aza Ray were missing, but police officers who arrived on the scene found the 10-year-old dead in another part of the house.

At around 11.35pm that night, officers tracked down Aza Ray Vidinhar, who was arrested at once in connection to his brothers’ stabbing deaths.

At the time, police said they had a motive for the crime but would not elaborate on it.

‘We never imagined something like this could happen,’ the boys' father told KSL. ‘I understand that there must be justice, but life without parole would be way too harsh for a 15-year-old with no previous criminal history.’

At the time of the slayings, the father was on active military duty in Alabama. 

Neighbors described Aza Ray as a quiet teenager who excelled in his studies.

Local school officials confirmed that the ninth-grader was an honor student at West Point Junior High School.

Aza Ray made headlines in 2011 when he ran away from home, sparking a massive search. He was eventually found sitting in a Wendy’s restaurant four miles from home.

Outside court Wednesday, his attorney, Todd Utzinger, said sending Vidinhar first to juvenile detention gives him a real chance at rehabbing.

'It would be inhumane for any 16-year-old child to go straight to the prison without first having an opportunity for treatment and rehabilitation,' Utzinger said. 'That's what we're trying to accomplish.'

Once Vidinhar is transferred to adult state prison, his attorneys plan to ask the parole board to immediately review the case and assess his behavior in juvenile detention to decide how much longer he'll serve in adult prison.

The plea deal calls for a sentence of up to life, but the parole board could go to the opposite extreme and give him credit for time served and let him out immediately, Utzinger said. If Vidinhar doesn't do well in juvenile detention, he could serve many years in state prison.

'If he isn't rehabilitated by 21, the state wanted the safety valve of having him go to prison to see how he does there,' Utzinger said.
