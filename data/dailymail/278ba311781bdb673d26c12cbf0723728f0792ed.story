It may come as a surprise to many hardworking Americans, but governments in much of the developed world require employers to give employees varying amounts of paid vacation time. That, of course, is not the case in the land of the free and the home of the desperately-in-need-of-some-time-off, which has U.S. labor advocates calling for reforms to federal labor laws.

According to a recent study by the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, the U.S. is the only country out of 21 economically advanced nations to not mandate employers to provide paid vacation time to employees. While many U.S. business voluntarily offer paid vacation time to employees, the study found that roughly one in four U.S. workers have none.

Additionally, the study finds that those workers who don't have any paid vacation time are disproportionately employed at low-wage jobs that don't provide other benefits like health care.

Paradise: according to a recent study, only one in four American workers are given paid vacation time

The study included paid-vacation data from 16 European countries, as well as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.S. Of the countries included in the study, Australia and Portugal offer employees the largest amount of paid days off, with a total of 35 - 22 for vacation days and 13 for holidays. Next on the list is France and Italy, each of which require employers to provide 31 paid days off.

With the exception of the U.S. - which mandates no paid vacation days - Japan requires the fewest amount of paid vacation days with 10.

"It's time to bring them into the fold," economist John Schmitt, one of the authors of the study, told the Huffington Post. "There are firms that are 
profitable and do provide vacation. Frankly, it concerns me that 
someone's business model or success relies on not giving employees 
vacation."

Zero: the U.S. requires employers to provide precisely zero paid vacation days to employees

In an effort to get the U.S. on track with the rest of the developed world, Florida Congressman Alan Grayson introduced a bill into Congress this week aimed at mandating paid vacation time for workers by amending the Fair Labor Standards Act to include paid vacation time for workers.

Under the bill, businesses with more than 100 employees would be required to provide a week's vacation to full-time employees, and part-time employees who've been employed for at least a year and are on the clock for at least 25 hours a week.

After the proposed law has been on the books for three years, the amount of paid vacation time required would increase to two weeks.

"Overwhelmingly, it's the low-income workers who don't get the paid 
vacation," Grayson told The Huffington Post. "This is accentuated by the
fact that many people who don't get paid vacation only work 30 hours a 
week, or have less than a full-time job. These are the same workers who 
have no health care coverage and no benefits in general.""We're 
really hurting ourselves, and specifically we're hurting the most 
vulnerable among us," he added. "If every other advanced country can do 
this, so can we."
