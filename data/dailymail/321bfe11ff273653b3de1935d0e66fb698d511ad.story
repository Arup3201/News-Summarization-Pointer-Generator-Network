Chelsea captain John Terry has been pictured in two new gleaming luxury cars with an estimated combined price tag of £375,000.

He is still celebrating the new one-year deal he signed with the club at the end of last season, as he prepares his garage ahead of the new campaign.

Terry has been busy so far in pre-season, scoring in their 5-0 rout of Wycombe on Wednesday, before coming off the bench to score twice in their 3-2 victory over AFC Wimbledon on Saturday.

Despite persistent rumours that he was going to be moving on, Terry signed a one-year pay-as-you-play deal with the club at the back end of last season, meaning he'll be captaining the club for the eleventh season in a row.

And, following the departure of Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole, he remains one of just three players - alongside Petr Cech and Jon Obi Mikel - to still be at Stamford Bridge from Jose Mourinho's first stint in charge between 2004-07.

Terry and Chelsea head into this season hoping to avoid two consecutive campaigns without silverware for the first time in the Roman Abramovich era.
