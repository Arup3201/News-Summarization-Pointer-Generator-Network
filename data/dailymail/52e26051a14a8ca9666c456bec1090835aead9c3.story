Supermarkets should be banned from offering cut price deals on junk food to stop poorer families getting fat, the head of the health select committee has warned.

Dr Sarah Wollaston told MailOnline that too many special offers were on crisps, sweets and fizzy drinks, which encouraged cash-strapped shoppers to have a poor diet.

She warned voluntary agreements with big chains had not worked and regulation was now needed to force stores to offer discounts on fruit and vegetables.

Special offers on crisps, sweets and fizzy drinks should be banned to encourage poorer families to eat more healthily, Dr Sarah Wollaston said

A study in 2012 by the University of East Anglia’s Norwich Business School found that discounts and buy one, get one free deals were skewed towards unhealthy products

Research suggests there is a link between levels of income and the likelihood of obesity, particularly amongst women.

Dr Wollaston, a former GP, has vowed to use her election to the health committee to challenge 'all the crap from the lobbying industry, big alcohol and junk food industry'.

She said: 'The level of obesity is double in the most disadvantaged households.

'It is not just about the fact you are more likely to die earlier. You are more likely to spend more years with a disability. The cost of all of this is spiralling out of control.'

The government's Responsibility Deals – encouraging firms to sign voluntary agreements to improve public health – have not worked, Dr Wollaston said.

'One of the reasons why the most disadvantaged people are running into difficulties is partly because the healthy food is more expensive.

'If you are struggling on a budget, you are much more likely to pick food on special offers. But all of the special offers tend to be on crisps, sweets and junk food.

'Just by saying to the big vested interest supermarkets, if you are going to have loss leaders, put them on foods that are healthy.

'People can buy two packs, but don't let's see any more loss leaders on unhealthy food.

'The junk food industry is not going to do this voluntarily because they worry about the other manufacturer down the road. The industry says it needs regulation.'

In 2012 a study by the University of East Anglia’s Norwich Business School discounts and buy one, get one free deals were skewed towards unhealthy products.

Every year obesity costs the NHS more than £5billion every year and is linked to 40,000 deaths.

She argued that if someone wants to lead an unhealthy lifestyle 'of course that's entirely up to them'.

But the government should intervene, with new regulations if necessary, to make it harder for people to buy junk food.

She also wants an end to 'supersize' deals in fast food restaurants and cinemas, where for a few pence more people are offered bigger drinks, snacks or meals.

'While some people say it is draconian to say you cannot sell mega-bucket sized portions of sugary drinks, why is it such a trauma to say it should be a standard size? Most of us tend to take the default size.

'If you want to buy two, buy two. It is a simple way to say can you cut the calories. To some extent we have to accept that we may not change it for everyone.

'But if there are simple things which take calories out, we should just get on with it.'

One in 10 children aged 2-10 is obese, rising to almost a third among the over-65s, official figures show

She also wants calories stripped out of canteens in schools and hospitals and a ban on advertising of junk food to children.

Around 10 per cent of children aged 2-10 is classed as obese, rising to almost 19 per cent among 11-15-year-olds, 24 per cent of working age adults and 30 per cent of the over-65s.

'No-one should pretend there's a single thing we can do to wave a magic wand and everyone is suddenly slim and fit,' Dr Wollaston added.

'There is a huge amount of personal responsibility. But it is now so serious we need to state to step in and take some measures.

'The choice is you either do nothing and carry on saying it's all down to personal choice and you continue to pick up a huge bill through the NHS.

'We have to take out junk food calories and help to get people moving and more active.'

The Department of Health insists there is 'no magic bullet to solve the problem' of obesity, and will reuiqre effortGovernment, local communities, industry and individuals. A spokesman said: 'Our primary responsibility is to help the nation to be healthier.'

The department says that the Responsibility Deal is reducing calories in food and drinks 'to ensure that healthier options are available'.

'We also have a voluntary front of pack labelling scheme which will help people keep track of what they're eating and give them the information to make healthier choices,' the spokesman added.
