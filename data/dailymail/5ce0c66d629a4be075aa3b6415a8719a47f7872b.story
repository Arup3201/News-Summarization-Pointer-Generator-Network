A woman who survived a savage machete attack by her former boyfriend before rising on a pledge to fight domestic violence has died following a recent diagnosis and addition battle of cancer.

It was just five months earlier Maria Del Carmen Gomez, 53, of Las Vegas, Nevada was attacked outside a convenience store by an 18-inch blade that severed both her hands and sliced brutally across her head.

Months later into her recovery, taking numerous tolling surgeries to repair her hands and scalp, doctors delivered one last crushing blow with her diagnosis of metastatic uterine cancer.

Fallen: After surviving a brutal machete attack in March, Maria Del Carmen Gomez, 53, has died after diagnosed with cancer just months later

Resting in her final moments around friends and family last weekend, Ms Gomez described the Kindred hospital's walls in details only seen by her and the aid of her Morphine's drip.

'God will take care of him,' she managed to moan on Saturday about her accused attacker Armando Vergara-Martinez, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. 'I know he will,' she said.

It was the last day before she fell into a coma.

'I know her immune system had to be way, way down,' her plastic surgeon Carl Williams told the Review-Journal of her recovery efforts from her attack on March 21.

'I don't think she could fight anymore after what she went through,' he said.

At the time medics found that Ms Gomez had a malignant disease at an 'advanced stage' but was curable.

They planned to give her chemotherapy treatment and were hopeful she would recover, but with her dual fight to recover from the machete attack, she was ultimately beaten.

Vergara-Martinez is currently being held in the Clark County Detention Center on a $250,000 bond, with his trial on charges of attempted murder and domestic valance schedule for October.

She told CBS earlier this year: 'I tried to open my car. He started hitting me without saying [anything].

'He stabbed me two, three times on my head. I felt such strong hits over there.

'He cut these three fingers and left it on the floor.'

Doctors said that Gomez could have been decapitated if her attacker had aimed a couple of inches lower. Medical staff who 
reattached Gomez's hands believe she was 
covering her head with them when she was knifed.

She had since said she had no idea why she was attacked. Two years ago she had already reported Martinez to police for attacking her.

He spent 41 days in jail no a misdemeanour strangulation charge.

Gomez added: 'I never went back to him, but I did speak to him on the phone.

'And then one day he said he needed help getting recommendations for a job. I told him to come by the store on the night the attack happened.'

Doctors praised her remarkable resilience in battling through the machete attack recovery and then refusing to be beaten by cancer.

She endured a five-hour surgical 
procedure to remove her uterus and ovaries as experts cut out the cancer
from her colon, diaphragm and lymph nodes.

Brutal: Gomez was also savagely knifed in the back of the head during the frenzied attack earlier this year

Savage: Surgeons managed to reattach Gomez's hands in an operation, after the attack severed both at the wrist

‘I know I'm seeing the brutality of this terrible crime in a whole new light,’ said Williams. ‘I think others will, too, and we'll do more to stop it in this community."

Family of Ms Gomez said that she never complained about her pain, but smiled as much as she could and promised to champion against domestic violence once released.

‘But if they can't save my hands, I'll just use my voice,’ she said, according to the Review-Journal. ‘I can talk without my hands.’
