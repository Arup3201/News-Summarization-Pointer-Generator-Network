Hannah Foxley, a two-time breast cancer survivor, has just been diagnosed with cancer for the third time in three years.

The 35-year-old - who inspired millions of women when she posed naked in Cosmopolitan magazine following her mastectomy - thought she was finally in the clear until she received the devastating news two weeks ago.

'To go from believing that I was fighting fit and healthy to now realising that I am in a lot of trouble is a huge shock and something that I am struggling to come to terms with,' she told MailOnline.

Shattering: Hannah Foxley, posing in Comsopolitan magazine following her mastectomy, has been diagnosed 
with cancer for the third time in three years

Hannah said her world turned upside down when she found a lump in her breast in April 2011.

'It was like being hit by a train. It didn’t feel real. Like most young women, I thought I was invincible,' she said.

She had a lumpectomy and eight cycles of gruelling chemotherapy. Then, a week before her treatment was due to end, she found a second cancerous lump.

She had a mastectomy, followed by five weeks of radiotherapy.

The treatment was successful, however, she was rushed into hospital last Monday with severe abdominal pain and remained in excruciating pain for the rest of the week.

Tests showed that she has advanced stage liver cancer and that it has spread to her lung.

Fight: After believing she was finally in the clear, Hannah was rushed into hospital last week and discovered the cancer hadn't gone away at all

'It turns out that the cancer spread in the first place but it was never picked up and it has been growing ever since. So while I have been working to inspire others, all the time the cancer was taking over my liver,' she said.

Hannah started chemo on Thursday and says she is 'up for the fight'.

She has already changed to a plant-based diet, which provides an alkaline environment which some say helps in the fight against cancer.

She said: 'I started chemo last week and my Oncologist has told me that I do not have the luxury of time to explore other options, I must start immediately.

'The cancer is inoperable as it has spread too far and radiotherapy is not an option. I have therefore begun exploring how I can heal naturally alongside the chemo.

'One of the key factors in healing is diet.

I need to get my body into an alkaline state as quickly as possible and the way to do this is a plant-based diet.

Support: Hannah, who ploughed all of her resources into her business, is crowfunding to help her pay for her treatment

'I have read many stories of people who have survived cancer by switching to a plant-based diet and I have done this immediately. It is a big change and I have to completely re-learn how to provide my body with all of the nutrients it needs.

'The other form of healing is emotional. This is also key as many serious illnesses can stem from toxic emotions that we have not been able to express. This is true for me. So I am on a journey of healing both naturally and with conventional medicine.'

Hannah has made the decision to try treatment in an American clinic where they use homeopathic remedies.

However she doesn’t have the funds necessary after pouring her savings into a fledgling company two years ago.

'What I really need is financial 
support. I started my fledgling business 18 months ago and ploughed all 
of my resources into that. I now have nothing to help me through this,' 
she said.

So in an unusual move, Hannah is crowdfunding online to pay for her treatments.

Explaining
 her decision, she said: 'The biggest worry for me is financial 
security. After my second bout of cancer, I decided to leave my job and 
set up my business, The Women's Wealth Expert, a fee based financial 
planning business that specialises in working with divorced and 
divorcing women.

'I ploughed all of my resources into getting the business set up and now find myself with no financial back up at all.

'In
 order to give myself the best possible chance of healing and 
surviving this, I need to be able to pay for treatment, which is not 
available on the NHS as my options are so limited. I also need to be 
able to keep the roof over my head, which is the biggest fear.

'In
 order to cover my basic needs and pay for the 
treatment that I need to survive, I have set up a crowd funding page on 
GoFundMe.

Touching: Hannah can be seen being comforted by her mother
 as she comes to term with, what she describes as, 'losing a key part of
 her femininity'

'I have already 
had an overwhelming response but am asking for people to donate 
something, no matter how large or small to help me recover.

'Any
 donations from companies for organic vegetables, or anything else that will 
help me with my plant-based diet are gratefully received.

'If
 I do not survive this, or if I do and do not need all of the money, I 
will pay it forward by donating it to someone else who is in my position, 
or I will donate it to Breakthrough Breast Cancer as I am an ambassador 
for them.'

Hannah wants to raise £25,000 and it seems that her story has touched the nation - in 
just over a week she has raised more than £14,000.

Today, her funds stand at £16,000. Keeping her supporters updated, she writes: 'Thanks to your generosity, I have today been able to pay for my first round of functional testing and a block of appointments with my homeopathic doctor.

'I have also been able to pay for a block of sessions to work on my emotional issues as well as pay for all of the nutrients and food that I require to start to repair my body.

'All of this costs thousands of pounds and I just could not have done it without your help. Thank you so much for helping me with this journey.'

While
 she has never met them, an American financial expert has donated £120 
with the message: 'After browsing your website it appears we have much 
in common. Please stay strong (both physically and mentally) and please 
let me know if I can help in any way.'

Hannah, who is touched by the overwhelming support, added: 'I have to accept the fact that although I
 am incredibly strong-willed and positive and have everything to live 
for, I may not survive this. That's a really difficult thing to sit 
with.'
