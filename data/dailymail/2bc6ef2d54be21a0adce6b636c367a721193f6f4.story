A transsexual who posed as a gynaecologist and treated dozens of women at an illegal practice is today facing up to five years in jail.

Alexandra Svobodova - born Martin Sloboda before undergoing a sex change operation - carried out internal examinations on her unsuspecting patients.

The 30-year-old even prescribed prescription drugs for them, police claim.

The bogus doctor was arrested this week in the rural town of Bechyne in the Czech Republic, where her private practice is based.

Patient Lucie Hrabalova, 35, said: 'It's bad enough knowing that my 
gynaecologist was a fake and not qualified, but the fact that he was 
also a man as well is devastating.

'I hope they lock the pervert up and 
throw away the key.'

Svobodova had a sex change operation after travelling to Germany in 2001 because the operation was not available in the Czech Republic.

Police spokesperson Jiri Matzner said: 'She faces charges of fraud and infringing others’ rights after posing as a doctor as well as illegally prescribing drugs containing narcotics and psychotropic substances.

'We have 20 cases so far of people who were victims, in addition to the affected health insurance companies.

'She is an enterprising woman with a long criminal past. If convicted she faces up to five years in jail.'

Svobodova's alleged crimes are not the first time she has been in trouble with the law.

Six years ago, using the alias Sandra Svobodova, she posed as a lawyer representing high-profile clients in arbitration cases.

After swindling £5million out of her customers, she was arrested and convicted of fraud in 2009. She was given a suspended sentence of one year.

Among those to fall victim to her services were major Czech celebrities including pop singer Helena Vondrackova and singer/actress Monika Absolonova.
