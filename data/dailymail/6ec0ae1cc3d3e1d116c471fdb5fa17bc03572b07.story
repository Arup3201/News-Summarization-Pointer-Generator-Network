A childcare company in New York is offering families the chance to hire armed US military war veterans as nannies to 'keep tragedy from happening', months after two children were stabbed to death in the bath by their carer.

The no-nonsense nannies, which cost at least $1,500 a week, are as adept at changing a nappy as they are at reloading a semiautomatic weapon, said Tactical Nanny founder Jonathan Gilliam, a former Navy SEAL and New York City counter-terrorism expert for the FBI.

Gilliam, who is currently recruiting female applicants for the role, said he was inspired by the tragic case of Marina and Kevin Krim, whose two and six-year-old children were murdered by their carer in a horrific crime that shocked America last October.

Tragedy: In October last year, Kevin and Marina Krim's two-year-old son Leo, centre, and his six-year-old sister Lucia, right, were murdered at the family's Upper West Side home in October in an horrific crime that shocked America

Smiling: Kevin and Marina Krim have revealed how their surviving daughter Nessie, left, is helping them deal with the agony of the murder of her siblings Leo, 2, right, and Lucia, 6, centre

'That family even went down to the Dominican Republic thinking they were screening the nanny, but they didn’t really know who she was,' Gilliam told the New York post.

'We’re not just offering another nanny service,' he added. 'These women have a proven track record. They’re veterans protecting the future of the USA. They can keep tragedy from happening. You’re paying for the peace of mind.'

The former lieutenant - who once served in the Navy's special operations force, the division that took out Osama bin Laden - said his nannies are trained to spot and handle threats with the speed and precision that no untrained carer would.

Happy children: Mrs Krim arrived home at the family apartment to find two of her two children dead in the bath-tub next to nanny Yoselyn Ortega who had slit her own throat in an alleged suicide attempt

He has already hired a number of childminders, including Melissa Fraga, an army reservist specialising in enemy tracking and mission communications as well as being a top-level first aider.

'Let’s say a nanny would freak out if she hears sounds around her,' she told the post. 'I’d 
be able to see the situation, figure out where the noise is coming from,
check around the house and then do whatever other steps I need.'

He said all his nannies will come with a full background check and military records that reveal any problems, such as post traumatic stress during their service.

He is also consulting a psychologist to help match his employees' profiles with that of interested families.

Single mother and investment banker Kathleen Histon, 45, told the paper that she was ready to sign up adding that, with their training and security clearance, 'you really know the quality of the person you bring into your home... There’s no price you can put on that.'

Ortega has pleaded not guilty to the children's murder and is currently being held at a prison hospital.
