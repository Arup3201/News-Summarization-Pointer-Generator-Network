Over 200 young men have been forced to flee their homes in Derry over the past year, due to a campaign of violence being carried out by republican vigilantes. 

Shootings and beatings are now becoming more commonplace in Northern Ireland's second biggest city, which will become Britain's City of Culture in 2013.

Punishment attacks by Republican Action Against Drugs (RAAD), have also led to at least 85 men being shot, according to police figures.

Attacks: Over 200 young men have been forced to flee their homes in Derry over the past year, due to a campaign of violence being carried out by republican vigilantes

The young men, who are usually in their teens or early twenties, have been forced to turn up at an appointment with a relative or parent, reported the Guardian.

They are then attacked for reasons such as alleged drug dealing.

Last week RAAD claimed one of the north west’s leading drug dealers has taken advantage of its ‘amnesty’ and stopped selling drugs.

They released a photo showing two of their members standing over a man who has been hooded.

The group claimed that the man was 'very close to being executed' on two occasions but has 'given an undertaking never to be involved in drugs again.'

The escalating violence has now led to Martin
 McGuinness, the Provisional IRA ex-chief of staff turned deputy first 
minister of Northern Ireland, urging the public to hand over names of republican paramilitaries responsible.

He described the republican vigilantes as 'the new oppressors of the people of Derry'.

Strong words: Martin McGuinness, deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, has urged the public to hand over names of republican paramilitaries responsible such as those who killed former Derry boxer  Andrew Allen

Last February, RAAD gunmen shot dead a former Derry boxer, Andrew Allen, 24, just 
across the border in a relative's house in Co Donegal.

Republican Action Against Drugs (RAAD) is a vigilante group active mainly in Derry and the surrounding area.

It targets those whom it claims are drug dealers.

The group's methods include:

punishment shootings - these often involves kneecapping

pipe bomb or arson attacks on the property of alleged dealers.

In 2008, the group formed, offering an amnesty to all drug dealers.

Since then the group has widened its targets to include anyone it deems guilty of anti-social behaviour and domestic violence.

In an interview with the Derry Journal in August 2009, the group's leadership explained: 'We would monitor the actions of those who have come forward and, given an adequate period of time, interest in those drug dealers would cease and they could start to lead normal lives.'

He had been warned a few weeks later that he would be shot if he remained in Derry, accused of dealing in drugs - a claim rejected by his family and untested in a court of law.

Mr Allen's mother, Donna Smith, has become a figurehead in the campaign against RAAD and said she had lost faith in the peace process.

She said that families who are being threatened by teh group now live in a 'city of fear.'

'How can they call this the City of Culture when they (RAAD) are going around butchering children? Something has to be done, it has to be stopped before another family is sitting in the situation that we are in: me without a son, my other children without a brother and two small children without a father,' Ms Smith told the newspaper.

Although the police have vowed to prosecute those responsible, there 
have been no prosecutions for the 'punishment' attacks' and no one has 
been charged in connection with Mr Allen's murder.

In April more than 200 people attended a rally in Guildhall Square in Derry to protest against RAAD.

The same month RAAD was blamed for shooting a man in both legs in Creggan.

The organisers of the protest claimed the attack was deliberately timed to coincide with the rally.

The mother of the 18-year-old victim described how she had been ordered to bring him to an alleyway close to Creggan shops.

She waited a short distance away while the punishment attack was carried out and heard her son being shot twice.

The woman, who did not want to be named, said her son had been targeted because of his involvement in drugs.

Some RAAD members are ex-IRA members, but McGuinness still issued a stern condemnation yet of the vigilante 
campaign.

City of fear: Martin McGuinness, deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, has urged the public to hand over names of republican paramilitaries responsible

'RAAD are a tiny group of people. They are not representative and are not accountable to anyone but themselves. They are driven entirely by ego not by any desire to tackle drug abuse in Derry or anywhere else.

'There is also a very strong perception that some individuals associated with RAAD have profited financially from those involved in the drugs trade.  Shooting young people who have become addicted to drugs or threatening them from their homes does nothing to tackle this very serious issue.'

He said he hoped as a direct result of the public informants that RAAD members would be imprisoned in the near future.
