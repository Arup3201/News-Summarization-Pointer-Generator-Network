For most it is just a sedate little seaside town on the coast of Northern Ireland. 

But many of its 60,000 residents are hiding a naughty little secret behind their closed doors. 

Bangor is truly living up to its name after being crowned the 'randiest' place in Britain.

Spicing up the bedroom: Map showing which areas in the UK spends the most on sex toys

A new study has revealed the seaside town spends the most on spicing up the bedroom.

The research found that on average, a person spends Â£6.57 a year on sex-related products.

Maybe it is the sea air but neighbouring town Newtownards spends 5.4 times more than the average person on sex toys. 

Meanwhile, over in England, residents in County Durham are spending 6.4 per cent more than the average person,

In Norwich most of the cash is spent on a fetish for saucy shoes. 

Bondage gear is the most popular purchase in County Durham. 

Back over in Northern Ireland, people living in Newry spend their pennies on erotic books parting with Â£4.16 each every year. 

Magazine editor Sinead McIntyre, who grew up in Bangor, told the Sun on Sunday: 'There are 60,000 residents and none of them has ever looked particularly sex-crazed to me. 

'Whatever the case when I go home for Christmas this year, I will see my hometown with very different eyes.'
