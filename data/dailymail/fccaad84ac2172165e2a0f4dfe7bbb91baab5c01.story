It is the part actresses have been clamouring for since the BBC announced the remake of its classic bodice-ripper series Poldark.

And today The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the central character of Demelza will be played by 21-year-old Eleanor Tomlinson, who has appeared in Hollywood blockbuster Jack The Giant Slayer and the BBC drama The White Queen.

She will follow the late Angharad Rees into the role of the fiery servant who falls in love with Captain Ross Poldark in Winston Graham’s series of classic novels.

Producers have promised that a post-watershed slot will ensure the 18th-Century romantic saga is steamier than the original.

The original series ran for 29 episodes from 1975 to 1977 and attracted audiences of up to 15 million when it was screened at 7pm on Sundays.

It had such an impact that churches in Cornwall even changed the times of evening services to avoid a clash.

Last night Ms Tomlinson told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I will do my utmost to do justice to the spirit of Demelza.

Aidan Turner will play the title character of Poldark

She’s such an iconic character, who was so brilliantly played by Angharad, and I will do my very best to try not to disappoint the army of Poldark fans out there.

‘I am conscious of the fact that the original series had a huge following and was tremendously popular.’ Welsh actress Angharad died two years ago, at the age of 63, after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.

One of the executive producers of the new show, Damien Timmer, added: ‘Demelza is the heart of the story and it is a real coup that she will be played by Eleanor.

‘Angharad Rees made a big impact in that role and people really loved her. But we have gone back to the source material and we believe a new audience will fall in love with Eleanor.

Demelza is an incredibly complex character and we needed someone who has the potential to play the character for hopefully many series to come.’

The story follows the fortunes of Poldark, an Army officer who returns home to Cornwall from the American War of Independence to find his former life in tatters.

His late father’s estate is in chaos and the love of his life, Elizabeth is engaged to his cousin.

Poldark then sets about repairing the family name, but also marries Demelza, the servant girl he has made pregnant.

Other key roles have gone to Lark 
Rise To Candleford star Ruby Bentall, who will play Poldark’s cousin 
Verity, and Icelandic actress Heida Reed, who will portray Elizabeth.

Mr
 Timmer said: ‘We looked at many actresses but Ruby and Heida stood 
apart. Heida plays Elizabeth, who left Poldark for his cousin. It’s a 
complex, difficult role and there is something incredibly likeable and 
sympathetic about her.

‘Ruby is a true star in the making with a big future and we are very lucky to have such a talented cast.’

In the original series, Verity was played by Norma Streader and Elizabeth by Jill Townsend, while Robin Ellis was the dashing Poldark.

The new eight-part series, due to air next year, will feature Irish film star Aidan Turner in the title role.

Winston Graham’s son Andrew said: ‘I am thrilled that producers Mammoth Screen are bringing my father’s novels freshly to life with such authenticity to the original books.

We already have a brilliant Ross in Aidan Turner and now we have the two people he loves. I am sure Eleanor as Demelza and Heida as Elizabeth will be perfect.

Ruby Bentall is also an excellent actor and is a great choice as Verity.’
