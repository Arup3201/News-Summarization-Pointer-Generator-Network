A rowdy bar-room brawl with fists flying broke out in one of the country's most exclusive fitness clubs - allegedly because of a girl.

Beginning in the 'Tap Room' bar of the New York Athletic Club, the melee resulted in the arrest of three men, with two reported broken noses and ten police being called to cart off the angry fitness enthusiasts.

With witnesses claiming the scene was more like the Lower East side of Manhattan at 3am than a Central Park society that costs $8,500 to join, the hierarchy at the club were unsurprisingly mortified.

Melee: Multiple people were injured and at least three were arrested when a massive brawl broke out at the New York Athletic Club on April 13

The blog Wall Street Jackass went into greater detail, providing a play-by-play account of the ferocious Roadhouse-style rumble, in which the antagonists apparently acted like 'wolf packs'.

Effusive about the 'epicness' of the fight, the blog goes on to state 
that the ruckous had become so disruptive that non-combatants had no 
choice but to sit and watch.

The witness wrote: ‘It was the best fight I've ever seen. Young people, old people, girls, members, non-members, it was a nondiscriminatory ragematch’.

'Not sure the reason but it seemed to be over a girl.

'Anyway, probably two broken noses right off the back, one dude knocked straight on his butt on the first punch, glasses thrown, broken glass everywhere , and all the tables turned over or shoved to the side, they were making their arena.

'The commotion ended so everyone thought ,  until somebody knocked the guy's girlfriend over and this kid laid one dude right out.

'Girl got knocked over again ......Second stoppage occurred after a good five minutes when Luis the bartender joined forces to come in and stop it.  BIG MISTAKE , Luis fell like a bag of sand after a fairly aggressive push and he started screaming 'Call nine eleven'

With no word on why the fight broke out, the club apparently had to deal with 'glasses thrown' around the room and a woman cut badly enough to require stitches.

Emergency services did admit that in the early morning hours on April 13 a man with a cut head was transported to New York Downtown Hospital and one other man with unspecified injuries arrived at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt 
Hospital Center.

The New York Times reported that when the dust cleared, Peter Doran, 28, and Matthew O’Grady, 31, were arrested and charged with third-degree assault and second-degree harassment.

Also arrested was Colin 
Drowica, 30, thought to be a brokerage director who was charged with attempted menacing after he allegedly 
clutched a security guard's arm and threatened him.

Regardless of the details, the $3.500 a year club is trying to keep the incident under wraps.

In a letter to members obtained by The New York Times, club president S. Colin Neill said: 'I cannot state forcefully enough how abhorrent this event it to me, personally, and how contrary it is to the standards of decorum that we expect of our members and their guests'.

The letter goes on: 'Appropriate action is being taken against all of those involved. Such conduct will not be tolerated at the New York Athletic Club'.

Tradition: The club, which was founded in 1868, boasts that its member have won 231 Olympic medals, 120 of them gold

Neill also said that the distribution of photographs of the fight through social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook are in violation of the club’s constitution.

When contacted,  James O’Brien, the director of communications at the club, refused to comment on what
the witness writing in the blog described as the 'epicness' of the fight.

It is thought that the club charges $8,500 to join, and another $3,000 a year for membership.

NYAC was founded in 1868, and boasts
231 Olympic medals won by its members - 120 of them gold, according to 
the club's website.

Outside of the athletic areas, a strict dress code is enforced that outlaws jeans; sneakers; shorts; t-shirts and athletic wear. 

Women are forbidden from wearing halter tops, leggings and clothing that reveals bare midriffs.

The club has a second location in Pelham Manor.
