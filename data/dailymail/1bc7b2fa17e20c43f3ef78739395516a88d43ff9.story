Just one district in Britain has seen its proportion of migrants fall in the last decade.

The percentage of the population from abroad in Dorset's Isle of Purbeck - a rural peninsula near Poole - was 0.9 per cent lower in 2011 than in 2001, despite rising everywhere else.

In some parts of the country the proportion of migrants in the general population doubled, the report found, and in two areas it more than tripled, according to an Oxford University report.

Rural: Dorset's Isle of Purbeck features Corfe Castle (pictured), retirement cottages, holiday homes... and the status of the only district in Britain where the proportion of migrants fell between 2001 and 2011

The biggest increase was in Boston, Lincolnshire, where the proportion of migrants almost quintupled from 3 per cent to 15 per cent of the town's residents.

And in Merthyr Tydil, South Wales, the proportion of migrants rose from 1.4 per cent to 4.5 per cent.

The figures were compiled by the Migration Observatory, a body based at the Centre on Migration, Policy and Society at Oxford University.

Experts looked at the changes in Britain's make-up between the 2001 census and the 2011 census.

Although London still has by far the highest proportion of migrants per head of population, the biggest increases were almost all outside the capital.

Hull, Wrexham and Aberdeen were among the biggest changers, with all seeing the proportion of migrants in the population more than double.

Increase: Boston, Lincolnshire, has seen its proportion of migrants increase from 3 per cent to 15 per cent

Purbeck was the only place where the proportion of migrants fell, but even there, the actual number rose - by eight people.

The rural area is popular with tourists and has become a hotspot for holiday homes and retirement cottages, driving up the price of houses for everyone else.

Most of Purbeck is made up of woods and fields and it features Corfe Castle, a former fortress which was partially demolished in the English Civil War.

Nathan Gadenne, director of Booth & Co estate agents in Wareham, Purbeck's largest town, said: 'There's two reasons behind the low number of migrants.

'The first is income - I would expect many new migrants aren't earning enough to pay what are the higher rents that we seem to have.

'The rents are pushed up by the high number of second homes and retirement homes. A lot of our clients are cash buyers looking to settle down in the area for a quiet life.

Gradual change: The figures provided by the Migration Observatory at Oxford University coincided with a report by the same body, which looked at the rise in Britain's migrant population in the past 20 years (above)

Population: 45,200

Average age: 45

Cost of detached home: £410,000

Average full-time wages: £24,000 

Unemployment: 4.1%

Top-rated tourist sight: Swanage Railway

Population: 58,100

Average age: 42

Cost of detached home: £184,000

Average full-time wages: £22,600 

Unemployment: 5.4%

Top-rated tourist sight: Bubblecar Museum 

'The second reason is the number of jobs. Migrants would want to move somewhere that's got good job prospects and a lot of work here is seasonal - although we do get some workers in the hospitality industry.'

In Boston, high levels of migration have helped the 55,000-strong population of 2001 rise by around 10,000.

The town's Tory MP Mark Simmonds has led a campaign to win more government funding for the area, whose migration figures were described as unique in a Home Office report last year.

The rankings coincide with a report yesterday by the Migration Observatory which examined changes to Britain's make-up over the past 20 years.

'The share of foreign-born people in the UK’s total population increased by over 50 per cent between 1993 and 2013,' the report said.

Data: London still has by far the highest proportion of foreign-born citizens overall compared to other areas

'The UK population was 12.5 per cent foreign-born and 8 per cent non-British citizens in 2013.'

The report included England, Wales and Scotland, but not Northern Ireland, because of the number of people crossing the border from the Republic of Ireland who count as EU migrants.

The top four countries sending people to Britain were India, Pakistan, Poland and Ireland.

Germany, South Africa, the U.S., Nigeria, Bangladesh, Italy, Romania and Lithuania all featured high on the list, which looked at both nationality and country of birth.

Some 13 per cent of all migrants are now Polish nationals, higher than any other country. Polish nationals have been free to live and work in Britain since the country joined the EU in 2004.
