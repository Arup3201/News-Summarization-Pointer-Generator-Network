In the dock: Owner Akhtar Khan will be sentenced after his staff used an unsafe meat slicer shortly after it cut off a man's fingers

A part-time supermarket worker's hand had to be amputated after it got stuck in a faulty meat slicer, a court has heard.

But despite the brutal accident staff at Ash Food Fair in Birmingham began using the machine an hour after it sliced off Nasa Iqbal's fingers and mangled his hand after they washed it down with Fairy Liquid and hot water.

Owner Akhtar Khan has admitted a charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act at Birmingham Magistrates' Court and will now be sentenced next month.

Barry Berlin, prosecuting for Birmingham City Council said the small supermarket's meat slicer had lost its safety guard a month before Mr Iqbal lost his fingers.

Staff had been using a plunger to insert meat since the breakage, the city's magistrates' court heard. 

Fellow workers heard Mr Iqbal screaming on the morning of October 12 last year as he placed his right hand inside the machine, which continued to operate as an ambulance crew rushed to the shop.

A paramedic only recovered three of Mr Iqbal's fingers after the machine was dismantled.

But an hour later a police officer arrived to find the machine was back in use and one of the employees said washing liquid had been used to clean it.

Mr Berlin said: 'He found, not withstanding the accident, the unguarded mincer was still being used to mince meat products falling through into the lower opening.'

In the evening two officers from the city council also discovered meat and herbs were still being passed through the machine. 

But the officers issued a prohibition notice banning its use until stronger chemicals had been used to disinfect it.

Simon Morgan, defending, said there had been arrangements to repair the guard, but there had been an unacceptable delay before the accident occurred.

Mr Khan will appear at Birmingham City Council for sentencing by a judge on February 16.
