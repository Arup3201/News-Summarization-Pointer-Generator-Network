A waitress who reported a woman to police who was consuming 'drink after drink of alcohol' while breastfeeding her child at the same time at a restaurant in Arkansas says she was fired from her job for taking matters into her own hands.

Server Jackie Conners called the police to report Tasha Adams, 28, of Leslie, Arkansas, who was at a pizzeria in Conway with her newborn daughter.

Conners says she felt it was ‘unacceptable’ for the mother to drink alcohol while breastfeeding her recently-born child.

For Conners, who is also a mother, what Adams was doing was not right.

‘Me, being a mom, and just seeing 
something like that and seeing a baby that can't speak for itself, 
having a parent do something like that is just unacceptable,’ Conners 
told ArkansasMatters.com.

Adams was arrested and charged
 with endangering the welfare of a minor after the incident at Gusano's 
Pizzeria off Dave Ward Drive in Conway on Wednesday. Her next court date is in January.

A
 couple days later, Conners says 
she was fired for taking the situation into her own hands.

However,
 a manager at Gusanao’s said that was not the reason for firing her, and
 declined to give more information on the matter.

A Faulkner County police report says the daughter was released to family members.

Adams,
 who lives in the town of Toad Suck, Arkansas, runs her own florist and 
events company where she makes flower arrangements, cakes and wreaths.

The mother-of-three claims the situation was taken out of context and 'all blown out of proportion'.

She said she wanted to tell her story but that she had been advised to wait until court.

'I hate that, because people don’t know the truth. I am really a normal person.'

'No
 one is seeing my side. I just want everyone to know I am 
not a horrible person. I have a family to take care of, and that’s all I
 care about.'

According to the International Guidelines on Drinking and Pregnancy, women who are breastfeeding should not drink.

The guidelines state: 'Alcoholic beverages should not be consumed by some individuals, including those who cannot restrict their alcohol intake, women of childbearing age who may become pregnant, pregnant and lactating women, children and adolescents, individuals taking medications that can interact with alcohol, and those with specific medical conditions.'

Mothers are warned during pregnancy that consuming even moderate levels of alcohol can cause birth defects in their unborn child.
