Callous: Thieves stole the wheelchair of a limbless French adventurer Philippe Croizon

Guilt-ridden thieves who stole a £20,000 custom-made wheelchair from quadruple amputee French swimmer Philippe Croizon have returned it.

Mr Croizon was staying with family at a house in northern France when a trailer containing his wheelchair was stolen.

But the Frenchman who was the first quadruple amputee to swim across the English Channel was reunited with his wheelchair today.

It was left by the thieves in a car park on Friday and found by the driver of a bus for handicapped people.

'He only called me on Monday evening to tell me about it, after watching a report on this case' on French television, Mr Croizon told AFP.

The 44-year-old, whose limbs were 
amputated after he suffered a freak 20,000 volt accident in 1994, had previously appealed for its return.

'They haven't just stolen my wheelchair, they've stolen my autonomy,' Mr Croizon said after the theft of the wheelchair and its trailer.

'I feel sad and angry,' he said.

'Let them keep the trailer if they want, but at least give back the wheelchair.'

Last year Mr Croizon made history by swimming across four intercontinental channels.

He is only the second person to swim the Bering Strait. 

American long-distance swimmer Lynne Cox was the first to swim the route
in 1987.

Croizon became a quadruple amputee 
when he was severely electrocuted by a 20,000 volt charge while he 
attempted to install a television antenna on his roof in 1994.

Bereft: 'They haven't just stolen my wheelchair, they've stolen my autonomy,' said Mr Croizon

It is
believed the first shock stopped his heart beating, while the second 
actually jolted it back into action and saved his life.

Over a period of several months surgeons attempted to save his limbs but were eventually forced to amputate his arms and legs. 

A
keen sportsman prior to his accident Croizon spent months in hospital 
followed by years of physical re-education.

He has battled depression 
and despondency to return to the world of sporting achievement.

Not long after his accident, Croizon was inspired after watching an American woman swim the English Channel.

Using
specially adapted artificial legs fitted with giant flippers, Croizon 
became the first quadruple amputee to cross the 21-mile English Channel 
in 13.5 hours in 2010.

After
he crossed the channel he put his elaborate plan to swim all four 
intercontinental channels into action, dubbed ‘Swimming Beyond Borders’.

Croizon risked getting hypothermia because he had to wear a thin wetsuit after his customised one did not fit properly.

He
said after the event: ‘The final stage of the challenge in Alaska was the hardest thing
I've ever had to do because the weather conditions were so bad so I was
very exhausted when we finished.

‘Water is soothing for me and a much better environment for my body compared to being in a wheelchair.

‘I've got no plans for any big challenges in the near future but “never say never” but now I'm going to get some sleep.’
