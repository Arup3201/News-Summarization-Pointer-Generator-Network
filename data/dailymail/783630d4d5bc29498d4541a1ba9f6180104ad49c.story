Kell Brook has claimed he was the victim of an ‘unprovoked attack’ in the stabbing incident that has left him facing an uncertain future in boxing.

The 28-year-old spoke for the first time on Friday about the shocking assault in Tenerife on Thursday, claiming he was not responsible for the altercation that saw him suffer a stab wound to his left leg.

Brook will wear a cast for the next four to six weeks and will be unable to defend his IBF world welterweight title in Sheffield on December 6.

In action: Brook turned in a gutsy display to beat Porter and line up a potential fight against Amir Khan 

Brook, who won the title last month, said: ‘I was out enjoying a night out before returning home to the UK when I was the victim of an unprovoked attack.

‘I’m devastated after being on such a high, having achieved my dream of becoming world champion. This is a major setback but the thought of defending my title is what’s keeping me positive right now.

‘I want to thank everyone for their support and ask for privacy for myself and my family. Make no mistake, I will be back.’

Despite suggestions the injury will wreck Brook’s hopes of fighting Amir Khan in a domestic blockbuster at Wembley in May, promoter Eddie Hearn told Sportsmail: ‘It won’t have an impact. I would anticipate that Brook will be fit to fight again in February or March, so I don’t think a fight with Khan will be affected.’

Hearn and Brook’s family have been at the fighter’s bedside since the attack, which is being investigated by the Spanish police.

Quite how Brook came to sustain the injury is not yet known, but the fighter is understood to have been on a night out in Golf de Sur with his heavily pregnant partner, Lindsey, who went home before the altercation occurred.

Brook was drinking with three others, including the man with whom he is believed to have had the altercation. The party left the bar at about 2am, going to the home of one of the group. At 6am, Brook and his alleged assailant left for the latter’s home nearby, with the confrontation happening shortly after. Police sources confirmed Brook ‘lost a lot of blood’ and that the alleged attacker has not yet been found.

Hearn confirmed that Brook underwent an operation at Candelaria Hospital in Santa Cruz, but denied reports that the surgery was ‘life-saving’. Brook is expected to be discharged on Sunday and will fly back to the UK on Monday.

This is not the first time Brook has been stabbed as the result of a late-night altercation, having suffered wounds to his side and buttocks in Sheffield in 2007.
