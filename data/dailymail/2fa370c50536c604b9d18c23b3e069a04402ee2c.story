It won't just be children and teachers who'll be upset if the government slashes school holidays from six weeks to four.

Theme parks and other tourist attractions could be forced to sack staff or even close if the traditional summer break is cut short.

The Deregulation Bill, which is in its final stages in the House of Lords, would allow schools to reduce the summer holidays, but lengthen other holidays at Christmas and Easter instead.Â

Concerned about how the new holidays would impact on numbers to tourist attractions in the summer, Julie Dalton, managing director of Gulliver's Land, World and Kingdom theme parks said: 'We are hoping the bill won't be passed.

'Our biggest weeks are in the summer holidays. Around one third of our business comes then because that is when it is nice weather and you can get out and about.

'You can't do that at Christmas and Easter. It would have a major impact on the number of people coming.

'If the bill does come through we would have to reduce the number of people we are employing, so it would make a huge difference. I would hope that we would fight our way through it, but some of the smaller attractions would face a much bigger battle to stay open.'

Julie was one of 30 leisure industry chiefs who publicly warned of the dangers the bill could create for attractions dependent on summer trade in a letter to the Sunday Telegraph.

Their letter said: 'Many in the tourism industry survived the recession by the skin of their teeth. The economic harm provided for within the bill is deeply worrying.

'We call on the government to engage with the tourism industry, consult, and properly assess the impact of this ill-conceived legislation.'
