Prime Minister Tony Abbott wants to develop a 'red card' system to stop 'hate preachers' from groups like Hizb ut-Tahrir from coming into Australia.

The radical Islamic group will hold a lecture against United States-led combat in Syria in  Lakemba, south west of Sydney, on Friday night.

Mr Abbott says the group is engaged in 'hate preaching' and members should not be allowed to enter Australia to attend such events.

'By all means let Australians who want to say stupid things to say stupid things but there's no point importing troublemakers from overseas to stir people up,' he told Macquarie Radio on Wednesday.

'I am sorry we haven't red-carded these hate preachers before but it will happen and it will happen quickly.'

Mr Abbott said the current law doesn't allow the government to ban Hizb ut-Tahrir unless the group engages in terrorism, even though it campaigns against Australian values. 

New laws to be introduced before the end of the year will also make it illegal to promote terrorism.

Friday's lecture, titled The War to End a Blessed Revolution, will accuse the US of attacking the 'noble Syrian revolution' by entering Iraq.

'America has initiated yet another war, rounding up its puppets and allies to attack the Syrian revolution, while using intervention in Iraq as a convenient excuse,' the lecture's brochure says.

It comes after the group protested in Lakemba with signs reading 'terror raids cannot break the spirit of Muslims' and 'stop terrorising Muslims' following counter-terrorism raids last month.

The United States is leading an international coalition in a combat mission to suppress the activities of extremist group Islamic State.

Australia has begun air combat missions in Iraq but is yet to drop any bombs.

A 200-member unit of Australian special forces is awaiting approval to head into Iraq to advise and assist the local military.

Mr Abbott says Australia has no plans to enter Syria and is in Iraq at the request of the Iraqi government.
