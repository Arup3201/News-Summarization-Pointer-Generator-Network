General John Allen, the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, has been cleared of military  misconduct allegations for exchanging 'racy' emails with Tampa socialite Jill Kelley, a key figure in the scandal that led to the resignation of former CIA Director David Petraeus.

A Pentagon investigation examined 20,000 to 30,000 pages of emails he exchanged with Kelley and announced on Tuesday that Allen violated no military regulations regarding the conduct of officers.

Allen's name surfaced in the Petraeus scandal after the FBI revealed that it had seized the emails as part of its investigation into whether Kelley was being harassed by Paula Broadwell - the married mother of two who was later confirmed to be Petraeus' mistress.

Breaks silence: Jill Kelley said her life has turned into a nightmare since the scandal erupted more than three months ago

Kelley, the wife of a prominent Tampa, Florida, surgeon, acted as a volunteer civilian liaison for officers at nearby MacDill Air Force Base. Allen and Petraeus met Kelley when they were stationed at the base while serving as the commanders of U.S. Central Command between 2008 and 2011.

Allen said both he and his wife Kathy became close friends with Kelley. He denied ever having an inappropriate relationship with her.

Allen, a four star U.S. Marine general, has been in professional purgatory, pending the outcome of the investigation. President Barack Obama nominated him to become Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces in Europe, but that nomination has been on hold until the results of the review came out.

Sources told the Washington Post that Allen exchanged only a few hundred emails with Kelley over the course of four years.

'Some of the messages are not the sort of things you would print in a 
family newspaper,' an official said. 'But that doesn’t mean he violated
 military regulations by sending and receiving them.'

Also on Tuesday, Kelley finally broke her silence over the Petraeus affair - the first time since the scandal erupted three months ago.

'Close friends': Allen says he and his wife Kathy (right) were friends with Kelley and that the relationship was never inappropriate

She said that though she never met Paula Broadwell, Petreaus' former mistress tried to blackmail, extort and threaten her'.

Kelley - who has been described as the 'other other woman' - has been accused of many things since the scandal erupted - that she too was having an affair with Petraeus, that they exchanged more than 30,000 emails, that she had an affair with Gen John Allen and that she used cancer charity funds for entertainment purposes.

She said from the moment the blackmailing email was sent to an account she shared with her husband Scott, her life was turned upside down as she went from wealthy Tampa socialite to a maligned, scamming mistress.

Kelley said she was terrified by the 
anonymous email and admitted in the barrage that followed there was 
'blackmail, extortion, threats'.

She would later learn they were from 
biographer Paula Broadwell, whose affair with Petraeus triggered 
his resignation as CIA director.

Speaking to The Daily Beast's Howard 
Kurtz, she said she had no idea who Paula was or of her relationship 
with Petraeus.

When the 37-year-old complained to a friend in the FBI, she had no idea of 
the chain of events she was about to set in motion - including finding 
herself accused of having an affair with  Gen John Allen, the U.S. 
commander in 
Afghanistan, which both flatly deny.

'I knew I was
 being stalked. I 
did what anybody else would have done when they were feeling threatened,
 to go seek protection from somebody I could trust,' she said.

In the interview, Kelley mainly dwells
 on the impact the scandal has had on her husband and children, 
recounting a party she threw soon after for her daughter's seventh 
birthday.

'It was devastating. To have your privacy invaded is 
truly...there are no words to describe it,' she said. 'Instead of enjoying a family 
birthday party, I had paparazzi storming my front lawn, pushing down the
 door. There are no words to describe the panic and fear at that 
moment.

'As much as I appreciate that [the media] want to be the first one to come out 
with a headline, regardless of whether they did any fact-checking, they 
have to consider the impact they have on our life and our children’s 
lives,' she says. 'Just because it’s repeated doesn’t make it true. It 
was living a nightmare.'

Kelley was known for holding lavish parties on the manicured lawns of her colonial style home overlooking Tampa Bay

Scandal: The revelation that CIA Director Petraeus was having an affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell shocked the nation last year

Afghanistan General John Allen: Kelley said the pair were just good friends and nothing more

The Lebanese-born socialite said a lot
 of reports in the media were not true, or greatly exaggerated, including that she had exchanged as many as 30,000 emails with Gen Allen.

While she did not provide an estimate, she said it was 
probably somewhere in the hundreds.

When asked about her relationship with Allen, whom she met when she hosted a birthday party for Petraeus' wife Holly,

'We’re friends, good friends,' she 
said of the relationship with the former CIA director. 'His wife and me 
are good friends. Our children are friends.'

'It was pretty straightforward,' Kelley says.

That friendship continued by email when Allen was sent to Kabul.

The 
general’s promotion to be commander of NATO forces is on hold while 
investigators examine the email traffic between him and Kelley - but sources have described it as 
 flirtatious and potentially inappropriate.

But Kelley contests this, saying they 
were sent from an account she shared with her husband and that sometimes
 Allen's wife was even copied in.

She said it has been particularly difficult for her cancer surgeon husband, who she deems 'an honorable guy' but what she wants the public to know is simple.

'I’m a dedicated 
mother, a loving wife. We have a very happy, close family. I support the
 troops. I take pride in feeding the homeless in our community. This whole situation is just very sad.'

In the fallout of the Patraeus scandel, Kelley was told to remove her vanity license plates that carried the title 'Honorary Consul'

In the fallout from the Petraeus scandal, which cost the decorated former General his job as CIA director, Kelly also lost her title as an Honorary Consul to South Korea.

She was also banned from visiting MacDill Airforce base in her role as a social liaison officer and told to remove vanity license plates that carried the title 'Honorary Consul.

Kelley, a mother of two, has never spoken publicly about her involvement in the scandal but is believed to be writing a tell-all book.
