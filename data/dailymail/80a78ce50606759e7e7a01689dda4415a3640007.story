Andy Murray’s sponsors Standard Life, who backed the No campaign before the Scottish independence referendum, have demonstrated there is no rift with the tennis star over his nationalist views by block-booking his hotel for the Ryder Cup.

The financial services giants are taking over the 15-bedroom Cromlix Hotel during the golf tournament, in which they are also major partners. The luxury hotel, which Murray bought for £1.8million last year, is three miles from his home town of Dunblane and just 12 miles from Gleneagles.

The five marquee suites are named after famous Scots including Robert the Bruce and, inevitably, Sir Alex Ferguson.

Standard Life signed a contract to be Murray’s shirt patch sponsor before Wimbledon last June in a deal worth around £4.5m over three years. But relations could have soured after Murray unnecessarily made a late-night tweet backing the Yes vote.

This was bound to alienate Standard Life, who have their HQ in Edinburgh. The group had said they would relocate some of their business to England if Scotland voted for independence.

A small number of fake Ryder Cup tickets bought online have been uncovered, with tournament authorities urging spectators to check the validity of their passes at www.ticketcheck.rydercupeurope.com. 

Spectators found with tickets bought from unauthorised sellers will be refused entry — as happened at Celtic Manor to hospitality clients of secretive Ipswich owner Marcus Evans. A spokesman for Evans said they had provided hospitality near the course but not tickets.

There is no love lost between rival watch brands Rolex and Omega, especially since Omega replaced Rolex as official Ryder Cup timekeepers for the USA. However, compared to the European players’ gifts of £7,500 Rolexes this week, the Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra 15,000 Gauss received by the US team might even meet the FIFA ethics code for ‘trivial or symbolic’ gifts with its mere £4,170 price tag. 

Fergie’s Irish fall-out

Paul McGinley revealed he first met Sir Alex Ferguson, who gave a speech to the European team on Tuesday night, at a JP McManus Pro-Am 15 years ago. 

That certainly wouldn’t happen now following Fergie’s seismic split with McManus and fellow Irish racing tycoon John Magnier over the breeding rights to Rock Of Gibraltar.

McManus has close friends at the European Tour who are regularly guests in his hospitality box at Cheltenham. But don’t tell Fergie.

Meanwhile, US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson showed the first sign of tetchiness when asked if the States had a comparable speaker to Sir Alex. Watson glibly replied ‘me’ and wouldn’t say who else might be invited into the team room.

Combative Beeb insider Dan Roan is expected to be promoted to BBC sports editor after a bizarre selection process in which short-listed newspaper journalists were discarded without even a screen test.

FIFA event managers Byrom, who had an awful World Cup with their executive Ray Whelan arrested over the illegal selling of tickets, have had a lousy start to the Ryder Cup, too.

Byrom’s organising of Ryder Cup transport was so shambolic yesterday that some coach drivers didn’t even know the route from Glasgow to Gleneagles. One clueless driver took wrong turns three times. Byrom passed the buck to the bus sub-contractors.

Ancient rockers Chicago going through most of their back catalogue at the 2012 Ryder Cup gala concert annoyed the European team, who were left hanging around before being introduced. This time Europe have ensured a set time in the concert for the golfers to be paraded at Glasgow’s Hydro Arena.
