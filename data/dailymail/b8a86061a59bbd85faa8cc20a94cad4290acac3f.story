Better news: Mark Carney can see positive signs in the economy

Mark Carney yesterday declared that Britain is ‘leading the pack of the major advanced economies’ – only months after warning it was in ‘crisis’.

The governor of the Bank of England confirmed the economy ‘strengthened’ this summer as it finally bounced back from the financial  crisis and recession.

In an interview yesterday he said: ‘My personal view is, given the recovery has strengthened and broadened, I don’t see the case for quantitative easing and I have not supported it.’

His words are a crumb of comfort for savers who have been hammered by QE.

They have lost out since interest rates were slashed to 0.5 per cent in March 2009 and the Bank started printing money to stop recession turning into depression.

Critics say more than one million pensioners have been consigned to a life of poverty because of the Bank’s strategy. The policy has driven down annuity rates – meaning pensioners get a permanently smaller annual income on the nest-eggs they have saved.

Campaigners welcomed Mr Carney’s comments but said there is still no sign of interest rates rising or QE being reversed.

Simon Rose, at campaign group Save Our Savers, said: ‘Savers may give one cheer to see the back of QE. But there’s no indication how the £375billion of gilts purchases by the Bank of England, which have done so much to damage pension funds, might ever be unwound. Savers are still under immense pressure with little prospect of relief in sight.’

The Bank has pledged not to raise rates until unemployment falls to 7 per cent or lower – something it does not expect until late 2016.

In the same interview Mr Carney added: ‘The advanced economies as a whole are doing a bit better. That’s going to help the UK as a whole. These are [Britain’s] more traditional export markets so that matters.

‘Within the UK, we are probably leading the pack of the major advanced economies as we speak right now. But of course we had the deepest recession, so we are coming back from that.’

Not a solution: Governor Mark Carney has said he doesn't agree with simply 'printing more money'

In April, he branded Britain a ‘crisis economy’ alongside the eurozone and Japan. Only last month he was lamenting ‘the weakest recovery on record’. The change of tune will delight George Osborne ahead of the Tory party conference.

Official figures yesterday showed productivity in the UK workforce has risen for the first time in two years – boosting recovery hopes.

Output per-hour-worked increased by 0.5 per cent between April and June – the first rise since the second quarter of 2011, the Office for National Statistics reported.

Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg Bank, said: ‘The UK recovery is showing signs of becoming sustainable as improved optimism feeds through to the hard data and the return of growth kick-starts productivity.

‘This recovery can be sustained, but probably not at the current heady pace and there will be bumps in the road.’

He said more QE, on top of the £375billion already pumped into the economy, was still an option, if the recovery falters.

The pound soared against the dollar amid growing confidence among international investors in the economy.
