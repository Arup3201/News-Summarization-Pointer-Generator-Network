An executive for the largest sporting events security firm in the US has been outed as a vicious racist.

Contemporary Services Corp’s Scott Dennison, 56, a vice president for special events, routinely sent hate-filled, profane emails calling African Americans everything from ‘scum suckers’ and ‘worthless,’ to n—-s.

Easily recognizable to people regularly attending American sporting events or concerts with their yellow ‘CSC EVENT STAFF’ shirts or jackets, the company’s security guards are ubiquitous with major events across the US.

‘No African Americans please only limited quantities that have brains and can actually do a day’s work,’ Mr Dennison wrote Oct 1, 2009 in an email revealed by the New York Post.

The email, according to the paper, was discussing recruits for the following year’s US Open tennis tournament – which holds its final in Arthur Ashe Stadium, named for the famed African-American tennis great.

Not content to just insult blacks’ work ethic and intelligence, Mr Dennison took it a step further in a July 14, 2011 email discussing a trainer scouting for new security dogs.

‘If he likes what he sees he will fly the Dog to Denver. There he will do a great deal of bite work, off leash training and some n—-r eating exercises,’ Mr Dennison wrote, according to the Post.

Mr Dennison also included a former black employee in mocking President Obama and the activist Rev. Al Sharpton in a July 22, 2010 email – this one supposedly hashing out details for a Craigslist post seeking security guards for that year’s US Open.

‘Yu sez brothurz, Mr. Gon allows the black man to be superior we run the place cuz we needs the money and Obama and Rev Sharpton allowed us to mix with the White Crackers at this event,’ Mr Dennison wrote, according to the Post.

‘Come on down we can cheat, steal, eat food and sleep. Just like our new govt allows us to do, to get back at the white man for Slavery,’ he continued.

That employee, Sean Felder, 45 from Harlem, is suing CSC for discrimination and retaliation. The 2010 lawsuit was filed in federal court, records showed.

Mr Felder did not return a message left by MailOnline seeking comment.

‘The first thing I thought was: How stupid do you have to be to put this in writing?’ John Storer, the former CSC employee on the receiving end of Mr Dennison’s vile rants asked the paper.

Mr Storer, 47, worked with CSC from 2009 to 2012.

Mr Dennison could not immediately be reached for comment by MailOnline. There was no answer at CSC's New York office when called Tuesday during business hours.

As VP in charge of special events, Mr Dennison also handles the AT&T Pebble Beach National-Pro-Am golf tournament and Barrett-Jackson Auction car shows, the Post reported.

Secured: CSC recently signed a five year contract to provide security for the US Open

CSC Founder Damon Zumwalt touts his company as ‘a rainbow coalition’ on the firm’s website.

The security firm announced last month a five year contract to continue watching over crowds at the US Open – won the past two years by Serena Williams.

The United States Tennis Association, when reached by the Post for comment, hinted at possibly reconsidering that deal in light of these revelations.
