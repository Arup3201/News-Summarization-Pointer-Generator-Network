Firemen in Germany were forced to don gas masks to rescue a bedridden obese man who had not washed in five years.

Neighbours of the 25-stone man thought their apartment block in the town of Nurtigen near Stuttgart, had been targeted in a chemical attack when firemen turned up wearing bio-hazard suits and respirators.

But it was because of conditions inside the 65-year-old's apartment - described as 'absolute hell' by one firefighter - which forced them into such drastic precautions.

'It was knee deep in rubbish, from rotting pizza boxes to old food and tins....and vermin rustling about,' the firefighter added. 'The smell was indescribable.' 

Firemen had to smash  the front door to his apartment down because there was too much rubbish behind it to push open.

The morbidly obese man was was found amid a pile of the refuse with serious difficulty breathing. A neighbour called police after hearing rhythmic tapping on her ceiling - his SOS for help.

Firefighters were later seen hosing off the equipment used to hoist the obese and foul-smelling man from the apartment block and disinfecting their protective clothing.

He told rescuers that he had been unable to wash and dress himself for the past five years and lived on take-out food that was delivered to his apartment.

A neighbour told a German newspaper: 'We had no idea what kind of state his apartment was in, but we got a whiff of it after firemen opened the front door.'
