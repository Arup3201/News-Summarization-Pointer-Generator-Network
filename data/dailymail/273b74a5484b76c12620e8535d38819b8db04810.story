Wounded: Howard R. Lazarus, 53, pictured, entered the Vernon Hills station just after midnight and told officers he wanted to file an accident report

An Illinois man who was shot and wounded after he walked into a police station and pulled out a BB gun early this morning claimed he was dying of cancer and wanted officers to kill him because he 'couldn't do the deed' himself.

Howard R. Lazarus, 53, entered the Vernon Hills station just after midnight and told officers he wanted to file a report regarding an accident he'd been involved in.

But when an policeman walked into the lobby to talk to him, he pulled out an apparent 9mm handgun, refused orders to drop it, and moved toward the officer.

The officer responded by firing two rounds, hitting Lazarus in the abdomen and shattering two glass doors in the station's lobby.

The gun was later found to be a replica and a suicide note recovered from Lazarus' pocket revealed he had wanted officers to end his life, the Chicago Tribune reported.

'I apologize for placing your officers in this position,' he wrote in the note. 'I am dying from cancer and couldn't do the deed myself.'

Lazarus was taken to Advocate Condell Medical Center in Libertyville where he remains in fair condition. He has been charged with aggravated assault, a Class 4 felony.

According to police, Lazarus told the
officer that he had been in an accident in nearby Mundelein, where he lives, before pulling the gun from his pocket. Police later learned there was 
no accident.

'The officer offered to give him a ride to the Mundelein Police Department,' police said in a statement.

'At that point, the subject pulled a handgun out of his coat pocket and pointed it at the officer.'

Officer Sharon Joseph said the gun appeared to be real. She said the officer tried to negotiate with Lazarus but had no choice other than to fire when the man pulled back the slide on the weapon.

'The suspect made moves to actually fire the weapon and the officer had no choice,' she said.

The officer, a 14-year-veteran, has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation by the Lake County Major Crime Task Force, according to the Daily Herald.

It is yet to be determined if Lazarus is in fact ill.
