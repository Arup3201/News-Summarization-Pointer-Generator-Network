Two men told the world they were calm, but it was impossible to believe them.

A press conference between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, the two contenders for the world title, fizzed with energy and a few niggling comments that betrayed the facades of quiet calmness.

Once the traditional handshakes had been done, the question of whether they would race cleanly was brought up. Just 17 points separate the pair going into the last race in Abu Dhabi on Sunday and the scope for skulduggery is clear.

The pair, separated by only 17 points, then pose for the world's media before this weekend's race 

1. Lewis Hamilton - 334 points 

2. Nico Rosberg - 317 points 

Lewis Hamilton will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, even if Nico Rosberg wins the race.

If the final race was a ‘normal’ race with 25 points for the winner, rather than the double points on offer, Hamilton would be able to claim his second drivers’ title with a sixth-place finish.

Hamilton said the two of them would not talk about how they behave on track. ‘No,’ he said.

‘We don’t need to. It’s been discussed at the beginning of the season and several times through the season and particularly after Spa again. We’re not children. We should know what is wrong and what is right.’

Rosberg, a company man down to his neat fingernails, was less restrained, saying: ‘Lewis can do something to keep it clean, which is to drive clean himself, so it’s not like he can’t do anything.

He added: ‘Of course I need to do what I can to put pressure on Lewis. He made a mistake in Brazil, so there’s a chance. I’ll do what I can.’

Hamilton and Rosberg will go head-to-head for this season's championship at the final round 

The German is bidding to emulate his father Keke Rosberg who won the drivers' championship in 1982 

Hamilton has won 10 races this year while his Mercedes team-mate Rosberg has racked up five victories 

Are they nervous?

Hamilton said: ‘I really don’t feel any more pressure. ‘In my racing career of 20 years to be prepared for today. There is no special recipe for it.’

Rosberg was a little more honest, saying: ‘It’s an intense situation. But it is the situation I have been looking forward to all my life.’

We could glean more from their body language. Hamilton was tight – or focused. He barely raised a smile though the half an hour of the official press conference. Rosberg was inscrutable. These are big moments in their lives and it showed.

But, of course, their body language may count for nothing when their lights go out on Sunday, when Hamilton only needs to finish first or second to be assured of the title.
