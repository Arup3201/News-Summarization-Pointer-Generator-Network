Websites such as Airbnb.com have revolutionised tourism, allowing travellers to stay with locals in cities around the world for a fraction of the price they would pay for a hotel.

But officials in New York City are now cracking down on short-term sub-letting, arguing that the practice is illegal, undermines the hotel industry and could endanger visitors.

Airbnb has been ordered to turn over data on its users in New York to the state's attorney general, who is investigating the possibility that residents might be breaking a law which bans sublets lasting fewer than 30 days.

Many tourists have welcomed the chance to find accommodation in the city for as little as $35 a night - compared to an average $275 for a hotel room.

In addition, many New Yorkers say they need the income from renting out their spare rooms to afford the city's sky-high rents, which currently stand at $3,000 per month on average.

'I use Airbnb to supplement my income, and it's allowed me to go back to school,' says Mishelle Farer, a 32-year-old former U.S. Army sergeant who rents her second bedroom in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighbourhood for $60 to $70 a night.

In addition to covering half her rent with the proceeds, she says she has had the chance to meet 'wonderful people' from all around the world.

Pauline Frommer, author of a series of travel guides, welcomes sites such as Airbnb, flipkey.com, couchsurfer.com and housetrip.com, saying they provide an important service to tourists.

'New York hotel prices are truly outrageous,' she said. 'The city is overwhelmed with visitors, and it's practically impossible to find an affordable hotel room, so you need some kind of outlet.'

Airbnb was invented in San Francisco five years ago by two roommates who could not afford their rent so decided to install air bed and rent them out to guests, and now offers 500,000 places to stay across the globe.

In New York alone, 15,000 rooms are on offer, ranging from $35 for a space in a Brooklyn studio apartment to more than $900 for an antique-filled loft in Tribeca in downtown Manhattan.

However, city officials claim that many of the sub-lets are illegal because the apartments' occupants are not there at the time.

In addition, they are worried about damaging hotels, which make up a large part of New York's economy, and say the city is being cheated of lodging taxes.

NYC & Company, the city's official tourism agency, issued a statement saying: 'This illegal practice takes away much needed hotel tax revenue from city coffers with no consumer protections against fire- and health-code violations.'

But Airbnb says that 87 per cent of its users stay at home while hosting paying guests, and describes the subpoena of customer information as an 'unfounded fishing expedition'.

Landlords and tenant organisations have long complained that short-term sublets are a violation of most leases, and pose security problems.

Having strangers coming in and out of a residential building 'is a terrible problem,' says Tom Cayler, chairman of the Illegal Hotel Committee for Manhattan's West Side Neighborhood Alliance.

'If you come home at night and there are people in the lobby or elevator who you don't know, you should be scared.'

Sam Shaber, a musician who used to rent space on the Lower East Side for $150 to $225 a night, says she welcomed guests from France, Argentina, Sweden and elsewhere.

'In this day and age of Craigslist, we have a radar for who's weird,' Shaber said. 'We never had one problem.'

Some visitors prefer renting rooms from residents because it allows them to pick up tips on local highlights and live like a native.

Sergio Verdasco, an engineer from Spain who stayed with Ms Farer in Williamsburg for three nights, said: 'It was an amazing experience - a soft landing in a city where I don't know the people and don't speak the language well. It's not the same as taking up a guide and doing what a million people do.'
