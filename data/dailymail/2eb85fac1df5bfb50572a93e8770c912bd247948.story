Facebook has released a county-by-county map of the United States that shows the baseball allegiances of Facebook users in every county in the entire country. The interesting graphic of the regional pockets of fandom reveals one thing: The New York Yankees are undeniably America's team.

In just about every region of the county, there are pockets of fans loyal to the Bronx Bombers. In regions that don't have a nearby team - like Alaska and Hawaii - baseball fans seem to support the Yankees by default.

Facebook's mapping of fans is not at all scientific - but it certainly is interesting to look at, and to see some of the anomalies of the often regional fan-bases.

Opening Day: Facebook mapped the baseball allegiances of every American county - in black on the map, the Yankees appear to be America's Team

Pockets of Yankee fans can be found in almost every region of the country. One of the more surprising spots of Yankee fandom is a small county in Virginia that is surrounded by local favorites, the Baltimore Orioles and the Washington Nationals. In the center of the region is one lone county of Yankee fans.

For the most part, regions are loyal to the team closest to them - people in Minnesota tend to be Twins fans, New Englanders almost exclusively support the Boston Red Sox and people in Washington state are Seattle Mariners fans.

However, in certain states with more than one team, the mapping of fans can be a bit scattered - for example, California, Texas and Florida are divided into fans of each of their multiple teams, again it tends to be influenced by which team is geographically closest to each county.

Boo: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio got booed as he threw out the first pitch at the New York Mets' home opener on Monday

Wrong team: New Yorkers overwhelmingly support the Yankees over the Mets, a sure sign Mayor de Blasio is extremely out of touch

New York also has multiple teams, but fans' allegiances seem to be only for the Bombers - the New York Mets are one of only three professional baseball teams to not carry a single U.S. county.

The other teams without a spot on the map are the Oakland Athletics, who compete with their cross-bay rivals, the San Francisco Giants, and the Toronto Blue Jays, which is the only Major League Baseball organization not based in the U.S.

The top five teams that carry the most counties are the Yankees with the one spot, followed by the Atlanta Braves, the Texas Rangers, the St. Louis Cardinals and the Minnesota Twins, respectively.

The teams with the most number of fans based on 'likes' on Facebook are the Yankees, the Red Sox, the Chicago Cubs, the San Francisco Giants and the Texas Rangers, respectively.

Padres: San Diego competes with four California teams for the state's baseball fans - and is losing (maybe its the uniforms)

Beltway: The Baltimore Orioles are the favorite team of the Washington beltway, beating out the Washington Nationals for many of the region's fans
