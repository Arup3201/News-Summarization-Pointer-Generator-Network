Professional origami artist Sipho Mabona is hoping to push - or should that be fold - the envelope of his art form by creating a life-size elephant from a single piece of paper measuring 15 metres square.

The extraordinary work of art requires four people working for two weeks to turn the two dimensional sheet into a three metre tall structure.

Over more than a month, Swiss-based Mr Mabona, 33, has painstakingly planned the intricate pattern, which details where exactly and in what order, to fold the paper.

Grand ambition: Origami artist Sipho Mabona is planning on folding a life-size elephant from a single sheet of paper

Scale: Sipho Mabona hopes to turn a 15metre by 15metre sheet of paper into a three metre tall elephant

Once completed it will be supported by an aluminium frame and covered in a clear lacquer to add to its rigidity.

Mr Mabona then plans to erect the 
elephant in the Art Museum in Beromünster, Switzerland, while being 
filmed by several cameras for a watching public.

But he now needs to secure the money to pay to turn his dream into a reality.

Plans: Sipho Mabona has spent more than a month working out the intricate pattern of folds required to turn the art from two to three dimensions

Intricate: Each fold in the paper will have to be in the perfect position

Crease: The Lucerne-based Sipho Mabona needs to raise $24,000 to make his life-size elephant project a reality

He is attempting to crowdsource the $24,000 required to launch the project. So far, donors have pledged nearly $17,000 - $7,000 short of his total - with just 17 days left.

Mr Mabona said: 'As an ultimate proof that there are no limits to what can be made out of a uncut square piece of paper, I plan to fold a life-size replica of an elephant.

'Over the course of several weeks the monumental sculpture will be folded at the Art Museum in Beromünster, Switzerland. A team of three assistants will support me on this mission.

Support: Donors have pledged nearly $17,000 - $7,000 short of his total

Origami in action: The tiny elephant, on which Swiss artist Sipho Mabona will base the life-size version, begins to take shape

'Using a sheet measuring 15 by 15 meters, we will create an elephant standing more than 3 meters tall.

'Further more we will install two cameras which will be feeding footage to an online live video stream, so you, your friends and family can watch us as we fold.'

He added: 'I believe that Origami and the White Elephant are so fascinating due to the prevalent belief that the use of only one piece of paper is very limiting.

2D to 3D: Artist Sipho Mabona will film his origami evolving from a flat sheet of paper into an elephant

Taking shape: The unmistakable elephant shape is created from dozens of creases

'But actually the very contrary is the
 case. In the art form of origami a simple piece of paper can be 
transformed into anything imaginable.

'It’s
 exactly this transformation, which in my opinion stands for many 
struggles we have to overcome in life. This project will be a great 
experience for us to share with you.

'Hopefully it will change public’s perception of origami and make people realize what a powerful art form it can be.

For Mr Mabona this project is the culmination of a life's dedication to his art.

Since the age of five, he has been obsessed with refining and perfecting his origami skills, creating an array of stunning figures, including human figures, birds, delicate flowers and insects.

He has also had some of his work displayed in art galleries around the world.
