The carcass of a beaked whale has been found on a Cornish beach – only the second time the species has been recorded in the UK.

The Blainville’s whale, usually found in temperate and tropical waters, was discovered stranded on Kenneggy Beach, near Praa Sands.

A member of the public reported it to the Cornwall Wildlife Trust as a porpoise, but experts confirmed it as a rare Blainville’s beaked whale.

Records dating back to 1913 show the only other one to reach UK shores was at Aberaeron in West Wales in 1993. However, experts believe Blainville's 
will start stranding more frequently in Britain as water temperatures 
increase due to climate change.

A member of the public reported the 
stranding to the Cornwall Wildlife Trust Marine Strandings Network as a 
porpoise on December 30 2013.

But when the Network's data officer, 
Niki Clear, received photographs of the animal, measuring 3.8m (12ft 
5in) long, she recognised it as an elusive Blainville.

Cetacean 
experts Colin MacLeod at Aberdeen University and Richard C. Sabin from 
The Natural History Museum later confirmed its identity.

The 3.8 meter long whale was reported to the Cornwall Wildlife Trust Marine Strandings Network as a porpoise, but when the Network's data officer received photos of the animal she was suspicious that it was in fact a whale only recorded twice in the whole of the UK

Abby Crosby,
 Marine Conservation Officer for Cornwall Wildlife Trust, said: 'We're 
very pleased that people took the trouble to report this animal to us, 
as by recording the carcasses of these creatures marine biologists can 
gather information about the species to help towards their conservation.

'This carcass was in a poor condition with advanced decomposition, 
so we would suggest that the public do not touch any dead marine animals
 they find, as they can carry diseases that humans can catch.

'It was
 a sad end for this amazing whale. However by examining these strandings
 it at least gives us a chance to investigate these animals properly and
 learn more about them. And the more we know, the better we're able to 
fight for their protection.'

Examinations found the whale was a 
sub-adult or maturing male Blainville's beaked whale.

Blainville's, like
 most beaked whales, are mostly found off-shore in waters 200m (656ft) 
to 1,000m (3,280ft) along continental shelves.

These elusive whales, rarely seen in UK waters, have distinctive high arched lower jaw; the males have a more pronounced arch and a tusk-like tooth at the crest of each arch

The species have a 
distinctive high arched lower jaw, with males showing a more pronounced 
arch and tusk-like tooth at the crest of each arch.

The Cornwall carcass was a 12ft 5in long maturing male which will be studied for clues to help in the conservation of the species.

The whales, named after a 19th century French zoologist, have a high arched lower jaw and long beak.

They are dark brown to grey in colour, with many tooth rake marks and circular scars along the body caused by cookie cutter shark and parasites, which are accumulated with age.

Syd Trudgen, a volunteer for Marine Stranding Network, was called to the beach after the stranding was reported.

Mr Trudgen said: 'It is very rewarding to be a part of an organisation that looks after and speaks up for dolphins, seals, whales and turtles.'
