The 6.0-magnitude earthquake that jolted parts of Indonesia today served as a reminder of just how active the seemingly-solid ground beneath us can be.

And these reminders have become increasingly frequent. On average, the world only sees one or two earthquakes per month that are 6.5-magnitude or higher.  

But April produced a higher-than-normal number of the major seismic events, as revealed in this incredible time-lapse video.

Scroll down for video… 

Magnitude 1 and 2 – Not felt by people, detected by instruments.

Magnitude 3 – Silght tremor felt by people indoors, likened to a passing lorry.

Magnitude 4 – Can crack walls, disturb trees.

Magnitude 5 – Moves furniture, damages poorly built buildings.

Magnitude 6 – Moderate to major damage, chimneys and walls collapse.

Magnitude 7 – Major damage to all buildings, ground cracks, landslides can occur.

Magnitude 8 – Total destruction, waves can be seen travelling through the ground.

Earthquakes happen every day, and as this animation shows, small ones happen at least once an hour.

According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC), which issues alerts for tsunamis, there were 13 major earthquakes in April. Five were higher than 7.8, which prompted tsunami warnings.

Moderate-to-large earthquakes are less common, but last month was ‘easily a record for this institution,’ according to the PTWC.

The time-lapse takes you on a journey of 
all recorded large and medium-sized earthquakes that took place from 
January through to April of this year.

The Earth appears calm up until April 1 when a huge 8.2 magnitude earthquake rocks northern Chile

The Earth continues to shake with another earthquake that hits the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific

The Earth appears calm up until April 1 when a huge 8.2 magnitude earthquake rocks northern Chile.

From there, the Earth continues to shake with another huge earthquake that hits the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific.

The activity doesn’t let up all month. But what is interesting, according to the PTWC, is the sheer number of other earthquakes that weren't part of these two major clusters.

There were isolated larger-than-normal quakes all over the world—in Nicaragua, Mexico, Canada, and even an unusual one in the South Atlantic.

The Centre gave no indication to what might have been behind the huge change in seismic activity.

The animation concludes with a summary map showing all of the earthquakes in this four-month period.

Scientists
 from Columbia University claim fracking could cause powerful 
earthquakes capable of destroying buildings as the process of extracting
 gas weakens fault lines deep underground.

American
 geologists said that a domino effect of quakes could be caused by 
intense pressure on fault lines created by hydraulic fracturing, 
combined with seismic activity thousands of miles away.

The
 Columbia University scientists maintain that powerful earthquakes can 
trigger swarms of minor quakes near waste water injection wells like 
those used for in oil and gas recovery.

They
 say a recent surge in U.S. oil and gas production using vast amounts of
 water to crack open rocks and release natural shale gas has been linked
 to an increase in small to moderate induced earthquakes in five states.

Seismologists
 from the university have identified three quakes in Oklahoma, Colorado 
and Texas that they believe were triggered at injection well sites by a 
major earthquake a long distance away.

The
 discovery, published in the journal Science by one of the world's 
leading seismology labs, threatens to make fracking even more 
controversial.

A
 joint UK study of hydraulic fracturing by The Royal Society and the 
Royal Academy of Engineering said that fracking can be managed 
effectively in the UK as long as operational best practices are 
implemented and robustly enforced through regulation.

The
 experts also said that earth tremors induced by hydraulic fracturing 
are likely to be of a smaller magnitude than the UK naturally 
experiences or than is related to coal mining activities.
