A mother who took her seriously-ill baby to an NHS walk-in centre was told he was merely teething.

Michelle Plevin rushed her six-month-old son Cason to the centre in Oldham, Greater Manchester, after his temperature rose to 39.5C and he refused to eat or drink.

But she was reassured by medics that he was teething and recommended Calpol.

Just hours later Carson turned blue, started fitting and was rushed to hospital where tests revealed that he had contracted bacterial meningitis, which left untreated can cause severe brain damage.

Six month old Carson Wright displayed a sky-high temperature but his mother Michelle was reassured at an NHS walk-in centre in Oldham that he was teething

Over a five day period at Oldham Hospital the toddler was given urgent treatment, including oxygen and antibiotics, before being allowed to return home with his parents Michelle Plevin, 25 and father Craig Wright, 34.

Mother of four Michelle, from Oldham, 
Greater Manchester, is now angry that doctors failed to spot the serious condition.

Over a five day period at Oldham Hospital Cason was given urgent treatment

She said: 'I'm still so upset because if he didn't start 
fitting and turning blue I wouldn't have rang the ambulance - the walk 
in centre should've spotted that something wasn't right.

'It was awful - he couldn't breathe and 
he was so dehydrated and looked awful in hospital with all the tubes in 
his nose and the needles in his arm.'

The incident occurred after 
Michelle, a part time hairdressing student, noticed Cason's symptoms and 
decided to seek medical treatment.

But unable to get an 
appointment with her own GP she took him to the Integrated Care 
Centre in Oldham, Greater Manchester where a doctor checked him over, 
misdiagnosed his condition and sent him away.

Michelle said: 'I didn't think it was teething 
because I've got three kids and I know what teething is. Yet you assume 
doctors know best and I took her word for it.

'If I would have ignored my instinct 
and just listened to the drop in then he might not have been here today.

'A nurse said if I hadn't seen him having those fits, he could have 
died.'

Now Michelle, her
GP, and GP practice manager are set to submit a formal complaint to the
walk-in service, where a full investigation is underway.

More serious form of the condition

An infection of the meninges (the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord) caused by bacteria

Symptoms usually begin suddenly and rapidly get worse

Early warning signs can include pain in the muscles, joints or limbs, unusually cold hands and feet, or shivering, pale or blotchy skin and blue lips

Early symptoms can include a severe headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, feeling generally unwell

If you suspect a case of bacterial meningitis, you should phone 999 immediately

Treatment includes antibiotics, oxygen, intravenous fluids, steroids and other medication to help reduce the inflammation around the brain

David Beckett, chief executive of Go To Doc, a body which runs the medical centre, said: 'We fully understand the distress the situation must have caused Cason's family and while we await a formal complaint I would urge them to get in touch with us so we can fully understand their concerns.

'Our preliminary assessment suggested that the advice given was suitable for the symptoms Cason presented with at the time.'

Mother Michelle, who suffered from septicemia 
meningitis three years ago, hopes that this will help others spot the 
signs of meningitis, as the rash - one of the most common signals - wasn't 
present in her or Cason's case.

She added: 'All we want is if someone goes to 
the drop in and gets sent away and they're not happy then don't think 
there's anything wrong in asking for a second opinion.'

In 2008 and 2009 in England and Wales, around 1,166 cases of meningitis were caused by bacteria which is most common in children under five years old.
