A man keeps his house warm with thousands of Christmas lights - because he says they are cheaper than central heating.

Darrel Piper, 40, from Dumfries puts up thousands of Christmas lights every year on September 1.

He says as well as being nice to look at, the bulbs emit so much warmth he can switch his central heating off well into January.

How festive! Darrel Piper puts up thousands of Christmas lights around his home every year on September 1

Cheaper living? Mr Piper, from Dumfires, says he can turn off his central heating from September as the bulbs emit so much heat they keep his whole house warm

Mr Piper said: 'Despite having thousands of lights up I find they're cheaper to power than my heating.

'They're about the equivalent of powering a 3kw fire.

'Once the lights are on for a while the place is like a sauna.

'I leave the doors open so the heat circulates through the house.

'Later on in winter, if it's really cold in the morning, I'll put the lights on first thing to warm the place up.

Mr Piper, who has thrombosis of the legs and is unable to work, continued: 'I put £15 a week on my electricity key card and £15 a fortnight on my gas card, which pays for my cooker and central heating.

Lit up: The man puts around 700 lights on his Christmas tree alone, and thousands more around his house

'I try to spend only around a fiver on my gas at this time of year and that's just for cooking, allowing the money to build up.

'Once I take the lights down after Christmas there will hopefully be enough on the gas card to pay for my heating into the spring.

'I really don't know how these heating companies expect people on low incomes to survive. For older people, it's heat or eat.

'I stock up two big chest freezers whenever I can so I have emergency supplies of food when needed.

'These days I usually get money for Christmas presents and put it straight on to the meter cards. You just do what you have to do.'

Mr Piper said his love of Christmas lights started when he was a young boy.

Memories: Mr Piper's love of lights comes from his father only allowing one set on the family's tree

He said: 'My father only allowed one set on the tree and I told myself when I was old enough I would find as many lights as I could and put them up.

'I go around charity shops collecting old sets. I love fiddling with the lights and fixing them.

'I have 700 lights on the Christmas tree alone and thousands more around the room - on the walls, window, hanging from the ceiling. If I could put them on the floor, I would.

'It takes me a couple of days just to get all of the tangles out and then my friend puts them up for me.

Until next time: The lights all come down in January, by which time Mr Piper says he has saved enough money on his gas card to last him through until spring

'Everyone thinks I'm mad but I don't care. The neighbours have come to expect it now.

'My mum stays around the corner and she knows if I'm in because you can see the lights from a distance.

'They put me in a great mood, I love them. I could stare at the lights all year round but I take them down on January 3 - it'd look stupid otherwise.'
