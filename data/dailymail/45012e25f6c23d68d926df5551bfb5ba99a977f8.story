The angel once held prime position at the top of the nation's Christmas tree, only to be recently outshone by the vibrant star.

But now, department store Debenhams are pledging to restore the angel to all its glory at the top of the nation's Christmas trees.

The campaign has been launched following the revelation that the star is the most popular tree topper, with 87 per cent of customers favouring it over the traditional angel.

And only 4 per cent of shoppers choose the poor fairy, a character that didn’t actually feature in the nativity.

Spokesperson for Debenhams Ed Watson said: 'The Christmas angel signifies everything wholesome and dignified about Christmas – it is as equally important to the nativity as the star and deserves to be celebrated as such.

Debenhams believe that the angel symbolises the true meaning of Christmas

'The angel signifies the true meaning of the festive period and is a way of reminding us as to what Christmas is really about. In this respect the tree topper is more important than the presents underneath.

'We are calling for our customers to save a dying tradition of putting the Arch Angel Gabriel on top of your tree this festive season.'

The angel has been a topper for Christmas trees since the early 18th century, in Germany, when trees were first brought into the home and decorated.

Debenhams sell both tree toppers, the angel is £10 while the star is £8, but they have upped their buy of angels in a hope to return them to the top of the tree

The star is a much more recent addition, not being used until in the early 19th century.

The Christmas tree didn’t reach Britain until later in the 19th century and both stars and angels were used. The fairy has only crept to the top of the tree in the last 30 years.

Ed Watson added: 'We have upped our buy of angels this year as a hope to end the star’s monopoly over Christmas tree toppers and make the angel as celebrated as it once was.'

The angel symbolises the first ever Christmas- in particular Gabriel, the archangel of revelation, who informed Mary that she would be the mother of Jesus Christ.

Also, an angel visited Joseph in a dream to tell him that he would serve as Jesus' father on Earth, and a number of angels appeared in the sky over Bethlehem to announce and celebrate Jesus' birth.

A tree was first decorated for Christmas in Latvia in 1510 which soon became a popular tradition.

Angels would be placed at the top of a Christmas tree to symbolise the significance of the angels who appeared high above Bethlehem to joyfully announce Jesus' birth on the first Christmas. 

They are also used to scare away evil spirits from people's homes.

If not an angel, a star was used to represent the bright star that appeared in the sky to guide people to Jesus' birthplace.

Also, in King James's translation of the Bible it states: 'Lo, the star went before them, till it came and stood over where Baby Jesus was lying.'

Since then, stars have become somewhat a fashion statement to place at the top of a tree.
