This is the heart-stopping moment a thrill-seeking kayaker plunges 150ft from the top of a waterfall and falls through a rainbow.

Taken this summer, the heart-stopping images were captured on camera by celebrated sports photographer Eric Parker as extreme kayaker Rafael Ortiz tackled the 150ft drop of the Alexander Falls waterfall in British Columbia, Canada.

Mr Ortiz, an adrenaline junkie kayaker from Mexico, is no stranger to danger but shooting through a rainbow whilst hurtling down the gnarliest of white-water depths was an added bonus.

White-water kayaking requires the paddler to roll and spin and manoeuvre the kayak in accordance with the river currents. Here Mr Ortiz bounces down smaller drop

This composite image shows the stages of Mr Ortiz's approach to the rapid. By leaning left and right according to the direction of the currents around him, he is able to stop himself from being flipped upside down

He is a legend in a sport which has taken him all over the world including an expedition when he managed to land the tallest waterfall ever dropped - the 189ft-high Pallouse Falls in Washington.

Mr Parker, from Washington,  is a champion in the world of extreme sports photography and he managed to catch all the action on his trusty camera.

He said: 'I love that waterfalls, epic rock formations, and rainbows usually come in a package deal. 

'Rivers are incredible pieces of nature and these pictures show that nature off perfectly.

'There are few things more peaceful than water falling in the sky, which is why I love to shoot waterfalls.

'It was amazing to watch Rafael tackle this waterfall so skillfully.' 

Mr Ortiz breezes his way through a narrow gap between the sharp rocks which form the waterfall

Here he is pictured spinning in circles as he launches out of the river and down the face of a drop
