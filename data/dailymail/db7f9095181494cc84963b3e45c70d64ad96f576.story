Reverend Andrew Dotchin, 58, a well-known local character popular with his parishioners, was celebrating the end of Lent

 A wine bar banned its local vicar from coming in for a drink on Easter Sunday – because he was wearing sandals.

The Reverend Andrew Dotchin, 58, a well-known local character popular with his parishioners, was celebrating the end of Lent when he was refused entry at The Wine Bar in Ipswich. 

He was told there were health and safety concerns, because a glass could fall on his foot. Rev Dotchin, who preaches at Whitton Parish Church, said: 'I was gobsmacked. I think the man on the door had had a rough night. I said, 'Trust me, I'm a vicar' and I was wearing the dog collar – but he wouldn't budge.'

The bemused grandad, a massive Facebook and Twitter fan, grinned: 'It's their loss.

'I wasn't going to go in and tell everyone to go to hell or anything!'

Mr Dotchin, who preached in South Africa for 16 years, strolled off instead to the nearby Revolution bar in the Old Cattle Market for a quick drink and a chat.

'I have been in The Wine Bar before and it's a lovely place - it's a bit of a giggle really and occasionally this sort of thing happens.

'I don't get served in sandals in golf clubs but women do,' said Andrew, the son of a Royal Navy submariner. It's silly really.'

The bizarre run-in sparked a flurry of activity supporting him on Facebook, which he labelled 'hilarious'.

Wine bar manager Luke Parkerson defended the decision to bar Mr Dotchin.

He said: 'Unfortunately it's because we are a glass-led venue - a lot of venues in Ipswich use glass substitutes now.

'All it would take is someone to drop a glass on an exposed foot - that was our concern.

'It has happened once before and I am very aware of it and don't want anyone to have it again.

'My door team dealt with it and it's a shame I wasn't able to have a word with the gentleman personally.'

But defiant Andrew, a clergyman for 31 years, vowed to carry on wearing his trademark footwear.

'I am infamous for only ever wearing sandals because I find socks devilish!

'I'll go back there again and hopefully they'll let me in next time,' he said.

'It's very tight on numbers and it can get really busy, so I imagine the door staff are more closed off but they are just doing their job.'
