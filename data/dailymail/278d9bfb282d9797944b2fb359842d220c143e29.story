Classic cartoons Tom and Jerry and Scooby Doo have been named the TV programmes that parents secretly most like to switch channels to watch.

The nostalgic favourites - alongside Postman Pat and Fireman SamÂ  - are popular with parents of young children because they remind them of their own childhood, according to a study.

A survey of 500 parents of children aged four to 10 revealed the shows much loved among parents.

A survey has revealed that the US cartoon series Scooby Doo was named the favourite cartoon among 23 per cent of parents

Horrible Histories and Mickey Mouse Club House were also hailed as the top TV shows that parents secretly love.

The survey by internet content provider Viral Spiral revealed that the US cartoon series Scooby Doo was named the favourite cartoon among 23 per cent of parents, followed by Peppa Pig and Postman Pat, both on 22 per cent.

The next favourites were Tom and Jerry (21 per cent), Fireman Sam (20 per cent), Sponge Bob Square Pants (17 per cent) and Art Attack (14 per cent).

Other children's shows that parents secretly love include Thomas the Tank Engine, Mickey Mouse Club House and Bob the Builder.

Damian Collier, head of Viral Spiral said: 'Our survey has revealed that parents secretly love many of the shows that their children watch.

Postman Pat - another of the favourites - has been on UK TV for more than 30 years alongside Fireman Sam who has graced UK screens for 28 years

'Parents even admitted that they often change the channel to watch their favourite cartoons and kids shows. Creating TV shows and content for young children is as much about meeting parents desires for nostalgia and fun as it is about entertaining children.'

The majority of children's programmes which adults love to watch are steeped in history and nostalgia.

Scooby Doo has been on UK screens for more than 44 years while Tom and Jerry has been broadcast since 1960.

Even Postman Pat has been on UK TV for more than 30 years alongside Fireman Sam who has graced UK screens for 28 years. Peppa Pig who also hit the top spot is a relative newcomer but has still been on our screens for 9 years.

One in three parents said sentimental recollection played a big part in their enjoyment of current children's shows because they remembered watching them as a child.

A large proportion of parents also said the shows gave them with a break from often depressing adult TV programmes.
