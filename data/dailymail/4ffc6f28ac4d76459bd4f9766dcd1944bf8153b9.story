Rivals to Megaupload have seen a huge rise in traffic after file-sharing site Megaupload was shut down by the FBI and its flamboyant founder arrested in a high-profile raid.

After the FBI shut down file-sharing site Megaupload and charged staff such as flamboyant founder Kim Dotcom - formerly Kim Schmitz - with copyright violations, users have flocked to rivals such as RapidShare, Hotfile and 4Shared.

If the American authorities hoped that the move would dent the popularity of such 'cyber-locker' sites which are mainly used for sharing music and video for free they have been very much mistaken. 

Rapidshare, Hotfile and 4Shared, have reaped the rewards of the arrest of Megaupload's 'pirate captain' Kim Dotcom.

One site, 4Shared, which has 2.5bn page views per month, is now twice the size Megaupload was before it shut down and the others have seen the numbers using their services nearly doubled.

4Shared is currently the subject of legal action in New Jersey, with a firm, Modulo Security Solutions, seeking to reveal the identities of individuals who uploaded and shared confidential documents. 

The 'cyberlocker' sites let users store large files and download them from anywhere.

MegaUpload, which the U.S. government 
shut down, was a Hong Kong-based ‘cyberlocker’ service that allegedly 
allowed users to download pirated films, TV shows, music and e-books with
 just a few clicks.

It is accused of costing copyright owners £322million in lost earnings 
and of making £113million by selling advertising and premium 
subscriptions.

The traffic surge following Megaupload's closure is an embarrassment to many of the firms involved as it shines an unwelcome spotlight on how they operate.

Such sites are keen to emphasise their legality in the wake of Megaupload's difficulties.

'This case has a great negative impact on file storage services and the 
Internet overall,' a 4Shared spokesman said.

'4shared has some of 
the most strict house rules among all other file storage services and 
there’s no need for any changes.'

Cyberlocker sites are legal, and operate in the same way as YouTube - in that they take down illegal files whenever told to by copyright holders.

As with YouTube, the volume of files means that every upload cannot be manually inspected.

Megaupload is accused of knowingly violating copyright.

Several Megaupload staff were arrested in New Zealand last week on copyright charges. The FBI also allege that the site was used for money-laundering.

Its founder, 'Kim Dotcom' - formerly Kim Schmitz - owned a
 £3million collection of 25 cars which was confiscated at the time of his arrest – mainly top-of-the range Mercedes with
 number plates such as ‘STONED’, ‘HACKER’ and ‘GUILTY’ but also 
including Maseratis, a vintage pink Cadillac and Dotcom’s runabout, a 
£300,000 Rolls-Royce Phantom with the number plate ‘GOD’.

Lapping in luxury: Dotcom splashes out in the Virgin Islands with a mystery woman. Dotcom was also in a film posted online enjoying a 'crazy weekend' on a superyacht in Monaco said to have cost millions

Lavish: Dotcom also had a garish pink Cadillac in his collection of luxury cars,  which was also seized by police

Confiscated: Others cars including a collection of Mercedes vehicles were removed from the Schmitz's home

Although music stars such as Kanye West and Alicia Keys have supported 
MegaUpload, film and record companies say the seven-year-old 
file-sharing site is making a fortune off their work without paying them
 a penny.

Hollywood film companies have been the main victims of piracy. The seven
 accused MegaUpload executives – including two other Germans and a 
Dutchman also seized in New Zealand – are each charged with five counts 
of racketeering, copyright infringement and conspiracy, and could be 
jailed for up to 20 years.
