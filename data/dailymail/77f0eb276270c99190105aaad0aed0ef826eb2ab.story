Rounding up sheep successfully is a difficult task usually reserved for experienced shepherds and their sheepdog.

But it looks like there might be something else working the fields in the future.

New footage shows how a drone can herd around 120 sheep across a field and through a narrow gateway within minutes.

New footage shows how a drone can herd around 120 sheep from Carlow, Ireland, across a field and through a narrow gateway within minutes

The flock in Carlow, Ireland, appears to react to the slight movement of the nifty aircraft - nicknamed 'Shep' - as it flies back and forth, with its blades making a buzzing sound.

The drone remains behind them at all times and makes them walk forward as a group until they get to a gate.

It even shows off its manoeuvrability by flying close to the ground before zooming into the sky to get the last three animals into the next field.

The footage - titled 'Shep the Drone, Worlds first Drone Sheepdog' (sic) - has already been viewed more than 82,000 times on YouTube.

As the farmer and photographer stand in one corner of the field the drone does all of the hard work, forcing the sheep towards the gate

The footage of the sheep was captured by Paul Brennan, who specialises in aerial photography for farmers

It was captured by Paul Brennan, who specialises in aerial photography for farmers.

His company Skyfly Photography wrote on Facebook yesterday: 'Delighted to say that "Shep The Drone" has just broken the 50,000 views barrier on YouTube in less than 48 hours.'

It added: 'A picture tells a thousand words and there is nothing quite so beautiful as an birds-eye view.'

The number of drones operating in British airspace is increasing and they are used for a range of tasks including surveillance, photography and defence.

They can be controlled by a pilot on the ground or used to undertake 'pre-planned' trips.
