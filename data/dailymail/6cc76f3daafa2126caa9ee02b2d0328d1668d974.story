A baby who was born with half a heart and was given just a 50 per cent chance of survival has amazed medics by flourishing - thanks to swimming lessons.

Charlie Cobb had to undergo open heart surgery just hours after being born and surgeons warned he might not survive.

Even after the surgery, he suffered a huge heart attack, underwent two more operations, and was hospitalised countless times after developing infections.

Charlie Cobb was born with half a heart and was given just a 50 per cent chance of survival. He has amazed medics by flourishing - and his mother believes it is thanks to his swimming lessons

But ever since his mother, Louise Bushby, 26, first took him to the pool the one-year-old has flourished.

Ms Bushby, a nursery practioneer from Brighton, said: ‘He just seems to thrive in the water and it seems to have helped him since day one.

‘I'm no doctor but I certainly believe it has helped him so much with his recovery and we go every week.

‘When he is running around he can get so breathless - but not in the pool. He can just get that exercise which has to be good for his heart and make it stronger, with the support of the water.

‘I'm not a cardiologist but it has given him a huge step in the right direction.

‘His cardiologists can't believe how well he is doing, and quite often when we take him in to appointments the nurses can't believe he actually has the condition he has.’

Charlie's mother, Louise Bushby, takes him swimming once a week and she believes that this has helped him to build up his strength. She says his doctors are amazed by how well he has done

Ms Bushby and her partner Dan Cobb, 28, were told 20 weeks into her pregnancy that her unborn son had hypoplastic left heart syndrome - a rare congenital heart defect where the left ventricle of the heart does not develop properly.

They were asked to make a life-changing decision about whether or not to continue the pregnancy.

They pledged to fight on for their little boy - even though he was given just a 50 per cent chance of survival.

He had his first open-heart surgery operation at one-day-old, and recovered remarkably well.

But hours before he was due to be discharged, Charlie had a cardiac arrest in his mother's arms and was rushed to intensive care.

Ms Bushby, said: ‘The doctors didn't think Charlie would wake up after the cardiac arrest and he was moved to the high dependency unit for three weeks before we were allowed to bring him home.

‘He will always have half a heart, but he is just doing so well now. He's 17 months now and he's walking, talking, running around - and of course swimming.’

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a condition where the left side of the heart has not developed properly.

The condition usually causes the left ventricle, which should pump oxygenated blood to the body, to be very small.

It also often results in a blockage between the ventricle and the aorta - the artery which carries blood to the body - and in the aorta being much too small.

Many babies with the condition are diagnosed before birth.

The condition is very hard to treat and the heart defect cannot be corrected.

Surgery is sometimes carried out to allow the right side of the heart to take over the work of the left.

However, this procedure is risky and requires three operations.

Occasionally, babies with the condition will be given a heart transplant.

Children with the syndrome sometimes experience breathlessness and often tire easily even after treatment.
