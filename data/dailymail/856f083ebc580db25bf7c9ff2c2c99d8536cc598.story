The man convicted of bludgeoning a baby to death in his cot during a home burglary in Victoria two years ago has lodged an appeal against his life sentence.

Harley Hicks, 21, was jailed for life last month after he broke into a Bendigo home in June 2012 and brutally bashed 10-month-old Zayden Veal-Whitting to death.

Hicks, who was 19 at the time, offered no explanation during his trial in June for why he bashed the baby more than 30 times with a homemade baton during the marijuana and ice-fuelled robbery.

He pleaded not guilty to the murder and his lawyers argued in court that his twin brother could not be excluded as a suspect.

But a Victorian Supreme Court jury rejected the suggestion and found him guilty in April.

Lawyers for Hicks applied on Wednesday to appeal his sentence in the state's Court of Appeal.

In sentencing Hicks last month, Victorian Supreme Court Justice Stephen Kaye described the killing as a 'totally and utterly evil crime'.

Justice Kaye said he could not say for sure if Hicks had viciously snuffed out Zayden's cry in a bid to silence the baby during the robbery.

'At no stage of the trial could I detect from you any sign of remorse. Nor was there even the slightest indication by you of any pity or sympathy for the baby, whose life you had taken, or for his family, whose lives you have shattered,' he said last month.

Hicks broke into the Bendigo home of  Casey Veal and unplugged her son's baby's monitor before repeatedly striking Zayden.

The murder weapon, a homemade baton, was later discovered at Hick's home with his DNA on one end and Zayden's on the other.

After his arrest, Hicks tried to blame the murder on another person and reportedly lied throughout investigations.
