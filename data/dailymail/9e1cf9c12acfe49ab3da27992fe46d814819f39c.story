Experts have had a good old chuckle at false reports of a 1500 year-old lost city near one of Australia's biggest tourist attractions – Uluru.

The supposed ancient human civilisation was said to have been discovered by Australian National University archaeologists on satellite pictures using a newly developed ground-penetrating radar back in October 2013.

Many Centralians had believed the lost city was a legitimate discovery before an ANU spokesman exposed the hoax that had been published on a satirical website.

'The first we knew about it was when we read about it,' the spokesman told NT News.

'I contacted our on-site archeology unit straight away and we all had a good laugh.'

'It was on a satirical website and is definitely untrue.' 

The World News Daily Report website reported that a team of ANU archaeologists, who were heading to an excavation near the sandstone red rock formation of Uluru, when they ‘unearthed the ruins of a large precolonial city dating back to more than 1500 years ago’.

‘The important number of tombs and artefacts already discovered on the site suggests that it could have been the capital of an ancient empire, completely unknown to historians until now,’ the site stated.

‘Over the last few months, many structures have been unearthed including what looks like a royal palace, a few temples, large rainwater reservoirs, workshops and dozens of houses.’

The site even quoted a ‘Professor Walter Reese’ who apparently suggests that the city was occupied between 20,000 and 30,000 inhabitants for 400 to 500 years, from approximately 470-80 AD, up until the 9th Century making it ‘the most important centre of civilization in the Southern Pacific at the time’.

However, the news and political satire web publication carries a disclaimer of reporting ‘presumably fake news’ which ‘may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways.'
