The funeral of Peaches Geldof is to take place on Easter Monday, it emerged today.

A service will be held at St Mary Magdalene and St Lawrence Church in Davington, near Faversham, Kent, where her mother Paula Yates's funeral was held in September 2000.

Her father Bob Geldof and other family members have been seen over the last few days staying at his country home, Davington Priory, which is next to the church.

Peaches and her son Phaedra earlier this year. It has been reported that the 11-month-old was found next to his mother when she died. Her husband Thomas Cohen raised the alarm when she wouldn't answer her phone

Bereft: The body of Peaches Geldof has been released to the family as her father Sir Bob has been spending time with her children Astala, 23 months, and Phaedra, 11 months, at the family home of husband Tom Cohen

Poignant: Peaches will have her funeral at the church of St Mary Magdalene and St Lawrence in Davington, Kent, where she was married and her mother Paula's funeral was also held

Those invited to attend the funeral 
service will be able to gather in the grounds of Geldof's home and use a
 side gate which leads directly into the church, avoiding the gaze of 
any media or members of the public.

Local
 people living in the village have become aware of the date being fixed 
for the funeral service on Easter Monday, although it is understood no 
official information has yet been publicly released or announced by 
church officials.

It is 
understood the funeral service will be held somewhere between 11am and 
1pm, but it is not known yet if there will be a burial or cremation.

Peaches, 25, was found dead at her home in Wrotham, Kent, on April 7.

Her parents were also married at the church 26 years ago.

A source said: 'The church holds the 
most bittersweet of memories for the Geldof family. They have had the 
best of times and the worst of times in that churchyard.'

She was just 11 when her mother died 
after a heroin overdose. The last message she posted online was a picture of her as a toddler
 with her mother.

Peaches had spoken of feeling the presence of her late mother keenly
 as she walked down the aisle of St Mary Magdalene and St Lawrence 
Church.

Speaking to 
Hello! magazine at the time of her wedding to Tom Cohen in 2012, she 
said: ‘I feel her [Yates] presence all the time but especially today. 
Mum loved family celebrations and she would adore Tom and the fact that 
we’ve married here. I know she is watching over me and feeling so happy 
for us.’

Mr Cohen said his wife was adored by him
 and their two sons, whom he would bring up 'with their mother in their 
hearts every day'.

Ms 
Geldof's elder sister Fifi posted a picture on Instagram of the two of 
them together when they were children, writing: 'My beautiful baby 
sister... Gone but never forgotten. I love you Peaches x.'

Peaches
 married US musician Max Drummey in Las Vegas in 2008, when she was 19, 
but the couple split amicably in February 2009 before divorcing in 2011.

In a column for Mother & Baby magazine, she wrote that she was now 'happier than ever' after becoming a mother.
