If you are looking to combine an exotic city break with sun and sea, Mumbai is an ideal destination. India’s largest, most prosperous city is a place where you will find everything, from heritage buildings, vast skyscrapers, fashionable apartment blocks, and gourmet restaurants to temples, green parks and street markets.

Mumbai is also home to the Bollywood film industry. It has a vibrant nightlife and a great choice of luxury hotels – not least the famous Taj Mahal Palace.

A stalwart of India old and new: The Taj Mahal Palace is the landmark hotel of vibrant Mumbai

A firm fixture: The Taj Mahal Palace opened in 1903 - and clings to an old-world charm around its courtyard pool

Coming into focus: The hotel - which is the subject of a new BBC drama that starts tonight - occupies a lovely location on the edge of the Arabian Sea (left); Right - the reception area revels in a certain opulence of style

This grand accommodation dame is the subject of a new four-part documentary series, Hotel India – which starts tonight (27 August) on BBC2.

The Taj Mahal Palace is one of Mumbai’s oldest and most beautiful hotels, located towards the southernmost point of the city in the Colaba district (0091 22 5665 0300; www.tajhotels.com).

An undoubted icon, it is a favourite with celebrities. Famous guests have included Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Russell Brand and Jemima Khan, Tom Cruise, Sharon Stone, Mick Jagger, Sting, Michelle and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.

It is also where Ravi Shankar taught George Harrison to play the sitar.

The hotel is a heady mix of architectural styles – Maharajah, Victorian Gothic and Florentine.

On the edge of the Arabian Sea: Mumbai is a city defined by water

Speeding by: Although Mumbai is a city of enormous size, it can be toured - easily and cheaply - by taxi

There are 560 rooms, including 46 suites. These are located in two separate structures – the restored heritage Palace wing, and the newer Tower wing. The most luxurious suites, including the Presidential Suite, are housed in the former.

But you don’t have to be an overnight guest to enjoy the all-encompassing opulence.

Facilities include eleven restaurants, two bars and two lounges – such as the Harbour Bar, the Starboard pool restaurant and Japanese restaurant Wasabi.

Or, if you want to sit and have a drink – or afternoon tea – while watching the waves of the Arabian Sea lapping at the shoreline, you can try the Sea Lounge on the first floor.

Outside, Colaba is a busy shopping area full of stalls, shops and markets – selling jewellery, clothes, handicrafts and silks. Mumbai’s two famous markets, Crawford Market and Chor Bazaar (Thieves Market), are also down the road. 

Guests at the Taj Mahal Palace have included Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, and Jemima Khan and Russell Brand

A wink and a nod: The Wink Bar, at Vivanta by Taj President Hotel, is a great spot for a decadent cocktail

At times, Mumbai can feel overwhelming.

It takes at least two hours by train to travel from the south to north. But taxis are cheap – and you can hire a driver for half day or longer (for about 1000 Indian rupees/£10).

Where you choose to stay can depend on whether you prefer the hustle and bustle of south Mumbai, or the calmer, residential suburbs in the north.

The south is the business area, and the core of the metropolis.

It is also where you will see some of Mumbai’s great landmarks, including the incredible Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus – the main railway station, built under British rule in the 1870s, and a UNESCO world heritage site. This was used as a backdrop for the final dance scene in Slumdog Millionaire.

If you want a luxury base at affordable rates, the Vivanta by Taj President Hotel (0091 22 6665 0808; www.vivantabytaj.com) is another option.

This is one of south Mumbai’s most happening hotels, with a stylish, laid-back vibe.

A city of noise and people: The southern districts of Mumbai can be incredibly busy - but have bags of character

In a rush: Street food for the time-pressed diner is endlessly available in Mumbai

It does great deals, depending on when you book (from around £60 per person, based on two people sharing). Its Jiva spa can also be inexpensive – prices for beauty treatments starting at around £20; Ayurvedic massages and facials from £40.

This lovely retreat is only a short taxi drive from Colaba, and a few minutes’ walk from the coastal avenue of Marine Drive – which runs from Nariman Point to Malabar Hills. This well-known promenade flows parallel to Chowpatty Beach, the only beach in the heart of the city, where locals go jogging in the mornings and meet up after work to socialise and watch the sunset.

Marine Drive also has many shops where you can buy quality fabrics and silks.

The hotel’s Wink Bar is a popular hot spot with the city’s fashionable crowd.

This is a great place to chill out. The bar features guest DJs, and a choice of vodkas, wines and cocktails – including the Winktini signature cocktail. The hotel’s Konkan Café deals in dishes such as mango prawn curry and Malabari chicken masala.

Out on a limb: The Taj Lands End Hotel sits on its own little peninsula in the Bandra area of the city

Come on in and relax: The Taj Lands End Hotel offers upmarket Italian cuisine at Maritime by San Lorenzo (left), and a little haven of peace at its outdoor pool (right), which benefits from breezes gusting in off the Arabian Sea

Must-see sights in this part of Mumbai include the National Gallery of Modern Art, the Hanging Gardens, Kamala Nehru Park and Dhobi Ghat. The latter is Mumbai’s famous open-air laundry, where clothes are washed in huge vats and left to dry in the sun.

If you feel like wandering, head for Bandra, Mumbai’s ultra-hip suburb, located on the west side of the metropolis – and stay at the Taj Lands End Hotel (0091 22 699 4488; www.tajhotels.com).

Leafy Bandra has a buzzy feel, with beautiful churches, cafes, restaurants and quirky little shops and boutiques. It is also home to many Bollywood stars, including Salman Khan, Shahrukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor.  Those fascinated by the gleam and glimmer of Mumbai’s movie industry can take a guided tour which shows off key locations (see www.bollywoodtourism.com).

As its name suggests, the Taj Land’s End sits on a little peninsula, overlooking the Arabian Sea. It has 493 rooms, including 33 suites – and five restaurants, including Masala Bay and the Italian sophistication of Maritime by San Lorenzo. For a session of celebrity spotting, head to the Atrium Lounge – a favourite with the Bollywood film crowd where Shahrukh Khan is a regular.

Mumbai is a busy, frenetic and intoxicating city. But wherever you are, you should always be able to find a retreat where you can enjoy calm amid the storm.

Virgin Atlantic flies daily from Heathrow to Mumbai (0844 209 7310; www.virgin-atlantic.com).

Greaves Travel (020 7487 9111; www.greavesindia.co.uk) offers tailor-made breaks to Mumbai from £1350 per person (based on two people travelling) - including return flights with Virgin Atlantic, four nights at the Vivanta by Taj President Hotel and Taj Lands End on a bed-and-breakfast basis (two nights at each hotel), transfers and a Bollywood tour.
