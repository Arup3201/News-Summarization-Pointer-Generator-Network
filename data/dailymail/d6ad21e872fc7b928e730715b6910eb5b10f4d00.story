Even by pre-season standards, Moussa Sissoko had endured a torrid afternoon.

Invariably he had passed it to an opposition jersey or, worse still, straight out of play.

But following a sedate 88 minutes, it was he who sparked life into this most turgid affair.

Gabriel Obertan attacked the by-line and drew back to the edge of the area where Sissoko was lurking.

Given how he had performed until that point, fans in the Gallowgate End would have been forgiven had they ducked for cover.

But the France international kept his composure and produced the game's one moment of quality, tucking into the bottom corner to win the game for his side.

It was United's final friendly of the summer but manager Alan Pardew would have taken little from it.

In the 10th minute Daryl Janmaat escaped down the right but his low cross skipped off the greasy surface and into the arms of Geronimo Rulli with Emmanuel Riviere sliding in.

The best chance of the opening exchanges came the way of the visitors when Inigo Martinez split the back four to spring Imanol Agirretxe clear. The striker, however, tried to be too cute and his chip was easily gathered by Tim Krul.

Tackle: Granero puts in a tackle on Haidara, not something the creative midfielder is renowned for 

Transfer: New signing Remy Cabella goes in for a challenge rather tentatively 

And that was as close as either side came during a subdued first half.

Pardew introduced Rolando Aarons during the break and his arrival triggered an improvement in tempo.

Jack Colback swapped passes with Riviere and burst into the area only to see his low drive blocked by a sliding Markel Bergara.

Aarons then escaped three defenders but, with options left and right, elected to shoot and scuffed tamely into the arms of Rulli.

The Sociedad stopper was again called into action on the hour mark, producing an instinctive one-handed save to deny Mike Williamson after he had headed towards the top corner from Remy Cabella's corner.

And so it was left to Sissoko to win it after fine work from Obertan. Thankfully, the full-time whistle sounded soon after. Competitive action cannot come quickly enough.

Manager: Alan Pardew will be hoping for a better season than last, which trailed off in the second half
