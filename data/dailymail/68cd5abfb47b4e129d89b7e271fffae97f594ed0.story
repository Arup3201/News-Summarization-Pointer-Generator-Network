The widower of novelist Dame Iris Murdoch has died aged 89.

John Bayley, a Professor of English at Oxford University, wrote the best-selling memoir, Iris, which charted the tragic decline of his wife’s health and intellect to Alzheimer’s disease.

Professor Bayley was widely regarded as being extremely devoted to his wife, and was her carer during her four-year long battle with the disease.

The book, which was adapted into a film of the same title in 2001 featuring Judi Dench as Dame Iris and Hugh Bonneville as a young Professor Bayley, brought the novelist to a new generation of readers.

The memoir laid bare her declining health and his care, but also included details of how, in her final days, she was unable to wash herself or control her bodily functions.

Although many regarded the work as poignant, Professor Bayley was also criticised for publishing the book before Dame Iris’s death aged 79 in 1999. 

Novelist Dame Muriel Spark accused Professor Bayley of ‘muckracking’ and writing a ‘sordid’ account.

The book also charted his courtship of the young writer and how he fell in love when he saw her riding a bike through Oxford. The pair had never spoken.

He also admitted that his wife had a string of affairs during their 43-year marriage. 

Later, Professor Bayley went on to write two more books as part of a three-part series devoted to his wife. They had been married for 43 years.

The final of the trilogy, Widower’s House, published in 2011, depicted life after his wife’s death.

Dame Iris is widely regarded as one of Britain’s finest authors and wrote a total of 26 books during her lifetime.

Professor Bayley was educated at Eton and became a Warton Professor of English at Oxford University. He was later awarded a CBE in 1999.

He became better known in later life for writing about his wife.

Professor Bayley, who was awarded a CBE in 1999, is survived by his second wife Audi Villers.
