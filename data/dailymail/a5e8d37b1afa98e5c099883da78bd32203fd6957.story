For 68-year-old Jim Geiger, age is not a barrier to conquering the world's highest mountain. 

The great-grandfather is on his way to Mount Everest in a bid to become the oldest American to summit the Himalayan peak.

'At 68, I’m in the best shape of my life,' the California resident, who has climbed some of the world’s tallest mountains, told The Sacramento Bee.

Geiger, who left his Sacramento home on Saturday, is scheduled to arrive in Nepal today, where he will meet with International Mountain Guides representatives and elite mountaineering Sherpas.

The ex-Marine aims to reach Everest base camp on April 6, and, if everything goes as planned, he will summit the mountain by May 11.

The experienced climber said he's motivated by his deep love for his family and the need to prove that you can still be vibrant as you age.

'Age is just a number,' Geiger said, according to a video posted on his YouTube page. 

'My kids and grandkids are the most important thing in my life and I am living my life so that they can see that I am there for them and can be there for them for a long time.

'There's no need to feel that, as you get older, that you need to be decrepit and can't do things. Baloney! You can.'

The current American record holder is Californian lawyer Bill Burke, who successfully climbed Everest in 2009 at age 67.

The oldest man to climb Mount Everest is Yuichiro Miura of 
Japan, who reached the summit aged 80 in May last year, according to Guinness 
World Records.

While Geiger acknowledged the dangers of the climb, he said he wasn't worried. 

He has climbed mountains such
 as Alaska's Denalli, Nevada's Boundary Peak and Colorado's Mt. Elbert.

His previous 
highest climb has been 22,841 feet, to the top of Aconcagua in 
Argentina.

To prepare for Mount Everest, 
Geiger’s training has included hauling a 65-pound backpack up hills.

He also trained on Pyramid Peak in 
Desolation Wilderness between Pollock Pines and South Lake Tahoe, which has an elevation of 9,987 feet.

'I
 probably have climbed that thing at least 80 times over the last 28 
years,' he told the Sacramento Bee. 'It is my favorite because it is a quick four miles up and
 4,000-feet of elevation gain.'

At the Everest base camp, which has an elevation of 17,590 feet, Geiger said he will try to get acclimated to the thin air over a month before his summit attempt.

Although he had the drive, he didn't initially have the $100,000 needed to join the International Mountain Guides-led climb.

The
 life coach said that in 2011, he began dreaming about conquering 
Everest and thought hard about how he would raise the money.

It
 wasn't until December 2012 after failing to conquer Mt Vinson in 
Antarctica that, in an incredible twist of fate, Geiger met a man who 
changed his life.

Geiger wrote on his Summit Leader Coaching blog that he sat next to a man called Andy in a mess hall at Union Glacier and told him about his Everest ambition.

Geiger
 explained that, by age 67, he had climbed Kilimanjaro, Elbrus, Denali, 
Aconcagua and Everest Base Camp, but never could afford to go to the top
 of Everest.

Andy, captivated by the story, agreed to fund the summit attempt.

'Well, I’ll fund you,' he said. 'And I mean it!'
