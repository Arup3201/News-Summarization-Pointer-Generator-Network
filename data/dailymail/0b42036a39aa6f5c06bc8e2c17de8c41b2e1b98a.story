Dressed in casual T-shirts with their arms around each other, the men posing for photographs could be documenting a visit to any tourist attraction in the world.

But these Turkish daytrippers aren't admiring a famous painting or well-known monument  - they are taking pictures of U.S. airstrikes against brutal Islamic State terrorists in the Syrian city of Kobane.

With explosions taking place behind them in a city where ISIS have butchered hundreds of Kurds over the last few weeks, the carefree men seem more interested in documenting the moment on digital cameras and mobile phones than coming to terms with the horrific reality of the situation.

Kobane is located so close to the Syrian border with Turkey that its northern streets actually run parallel to the barbed wire fence that separates the two countries. 

As street fighting rages in the city - which has a population of 400,000 - some missiles fired by ISIS militants have even crossed over the border and damaged homes belonging to Turkish families.

The fighting has led to a column of Turkish tanks patrolling the area around the largely porous border to protect against any threat posed the Islamists

Meanwhile U.S. airstrikes hit ISIS targets in the Kobane suburbs this morning in the hope of halting an advance that led to the chilling sight of a black jihadist flag being raised over a building in the east of the city yesterday.

This afternoon Turkish president Recep Erdogan said the fall of Kobane to the terrorists was imminent, despite promising he wouldn't allow such an event to happen only days ago. 

While all this rumbles on, crowds of onlookers have gathered on the Turkish side of the border to watch the bloody spectacle - making sure to capture every explosion on their smart phones.

The Islamic State is about to capture the Syrian border town of Kobane, Turkey's president said today, as outgunned Kurdish forces struggled to repel the extremists with limited aid from U.S.-led coalition airstrikes.

ISIS fighters using tanks and heavy weapons looted from captured army bases in Iraq and Syria have been pounding Kurdish forces in the strategic town for days.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the coalition air campaign launched last month would not be enough to halt the Islamic State advance and called for greater cooperation with the Syrian opposition, which is fighting both ISIS and forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad.

Turkish tanks and other ground forces have been stationed along the border within a few hundred meters of the fighting in Kobane - also known as Ayn Arab - but have not intervened. 

Crowds of onlookers have gathered in the hills around the Turkish village of Mursitpinar, where just a few miles to the south Kurdish fighters are battling against militants from the Islamic State.

From their relatively safe haven the people have been able to take photographs of the increasingly intense fighting in Kobane over the past few weeks, as ISIS creep ever closer to the city centre.

This morning, almost as if they were watching a fireworks display, the spectators took photographs of explosion after explosion as warplanes from the U.S. Air Force hammered terrorist targets in the east and south west of the city.

They are not alone in their fascination with watching a conflict unfold; just weeks ago a fierce three-way battle between Syrian government forces, Al Qaeda-linked rebels and fighters from the Islamic State drew large crowds in neighbouring Israel.

Residents in Golan Heights took took to the mountains in T-shirts, shorts and sunglasses to watch a bloody battle unfold in the town of Quneitra, across the Syrian border beneath them.

War tourism has a long history, dating back millennia when accounts of great battles would be written and told by individuals who claim to have witnessed them first hand.

By the 1600s Dutch painter Willem van de Velde was travelling on war ships in order to sketch fighting with English vessels - while the battles of Waterloo and Gettysburg in the 1800s both had spectators who had journeyed deliberately to the conflict zone in order to watch events unfold.

In the 1860s Thomas Cook organised holidays for British tourists on American Civil War battlefields, and similar guided tours were organised available for those interested in locations associated with the Crimean War.

In fact during the Battle of Alma in 1854 - considered the first battle of the Crimean War - Prince Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov is said to have invited women from the nearby town of Sevastopol to take up positions on a nearby mountainside to watch his men fight.

Turkey has demanded the U.S. carry out military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad a a condition for further Turkish support in fighting against Islamic State militants.

Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said that a no-fly zone must immediately be put in place over Syria to protect the Turkish border from both the threat of attack, as well as millions of Syrian refugees who have poured into the country during three years of intense fighting.

In order to put a no-fly zone in place, however, the U.S. would need to conduct targeted strikes on Assad's air defences, as well as provide additional support for millions of potential refugees. 

'We want to have a no-fly zone, we want to have a safe have on our border,' Mr Davutoglu told CNN News.

Turkey is reluctant to assist Kurdish fighters because they are affiliated with the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) - a group recently described as 'the same as ISIS' by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (pictured)

'Otherwise all these burdens will continue to go on the shoulder of Turkey and other neighbouring countries,' he said, referring to the refugee crisis. 

'We are ready to do everything if there is a clear strategy that, after ISIS, we can be sure our border is protected,' Mr Davutoglu went on to say. 

Turkey has been criticised for an apparent lack of effort in targeting ISIS in neighbouring Syria and Iraq, although talks will take place next week to discuss the country's contribution to the U.S./Arab coalition currently carrying out airstrikes on the terror group.

Turkey has been reluctant to assist Syrian Kurdish fighters battling against ISIS because they are affiliated with the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) - a group recently described as 'the same as ISIS' by Turkish President  Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Turkey has also been accused of 'doing deals' with ISIS, agreeing to allow up to 180 detained militants - including British-born jihadists - to rejoin the group, in return for the release of 46 Turkish citizens and three local Iraqi staff captured in the city of Mosul five months ago.
