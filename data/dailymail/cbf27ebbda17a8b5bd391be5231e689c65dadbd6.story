David Baddiel has branded Gary Barlow's new World Cup song 'rubbish' ahead of this summer's tournament in Brazil.

The comedian, who released the classic Three Lions with the Lightning Seeds and Frank Skinner back in 1996, isn't keen on Barlow's Greatest Day, which will feature former England striker Gary Lineker.

Speaking to The Sun about the new version of the Take That hit, Baddiel said: 'A cover of Greatest Day? That's a bit rubbish because it means they've given up, doesn't it?

'And is it just people called Gary doing it? Gary Barlow, Gary Lienker,' joked the 49-year-old. 'what about Gary Neville? Is it called "We're All Called Gary"?'

Baddiel believes Three Lions, which reached No 1 in '96 and again two years later when it was re-released and tweaked for France '98, is the ultimate football song.

'There's no other song fans have reacted to in the same way. It's hard for anyone else to do one as it'll be compared to Three Lions.'

Michael Owen, who earned global fame at the 1998 World Cup, and former England boss Glenn Hoddle will also feature on the song for this year's tournament.
