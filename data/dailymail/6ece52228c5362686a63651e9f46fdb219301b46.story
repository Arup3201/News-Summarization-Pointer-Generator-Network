Wipe-clean plastic bank notes earmarked to replace paper cash are a 'breeding ground' for superbugs, scientists claim.

More durable than the cotton currently used for £5-£50 notes, polymer provides a welcome home for diseases such as E.coli and the MRSA superbug.

The findings completely contradict Bank of England claims that hygiene lies at the core of their proposal.

A team of scientists claim polymer holds bacteria for 24 hours and is easily rubs off on human hands

In a bombshell study on currency and bacteria, Turkish and Dutch scientists lathered seven currencies with bacteria including the euro, US dollar, Croatian kuna, and Romania's polymer leu.

While the euro proved the cleanest - with no sign of passing bacteria - polymer leu notes held traces of MRSA for up to 24 hours, 21 hours longer than any other currency.

Dr Habip Gedik, who led the research at the Okmeydani 
Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul, told the Independent: 'Banknotes containing 
plastic substances are more likely to carry and transmit bugs.

'We never become ill just taking bugs from banknotes. But we should take into account that we can be contaminated and we should clean our hands after touching them and other probable contaminated material.'

Team member Andreas Voss, of Radbound University Nijmegen in the Netherlands, said: 'I was amazed to see that some currencies act like breeding grounds for bacteria while others seem to be auto-sterilised.'

Going ahead with a two-month consultation to gauge public opinion, the Bank of England is undeterred by the research.

The Bank of England is determined to continue with their two-month roadshow around the UK

A spokesman told MailOnline the Bank is enthusiastic about the project, but refused to comment on Dr Gedik's study.

He said: 'Polymer banknotes are cleaner, more secure and durable than paper notes. They are also cheaper and more environmentally friendly.

'They will last longer, if you spill something on it you can wipe it clean, and they fee so much smoother.

'They can even go for a wash cycle if you leave one in your pocket.

'We
 still need to see exactly what people think of it, which we will do on 
the roadshows. But essentially they are much cleaner.'

The Bank of England claims the smaller polymer notes wipe clean and could even survive the washing machine.

The new notes last for more than twice as
 long, stay cleaner as they are resistant to dirt and moisture and are 
almost impossible to tear.

The move will save the Bank more than £100million over a ten-year period because of the new banknote’s improved durability.

A typical £5 note currently lasts for two years. The new ones would last for just under six years, it was announced yesterday.

In a two-month consultation, representatives of the Bank will take model versions to shopping centres around the country to gauge the public's verdict before a final decision is made in December. If they feedback is overwhelmingly negative, they will scrap the plans.

If successful, the first £5, featuring Winston Churchill's face, would be rolled out in 2016.

The new notes will be slightly smaller than the current note - currently 135mm by 70mm, the new £5 will measure just 125mm by 65mm.

But they will continue to maintain ‘tiered-sizing’ – meaning that the higher the denomination, the bigger the note will be.

Bank of England chief Mark Carney is enthusiastic about the polymer notes, already used in his native Canada

The
Bank of England has tested the polymer notes in a 90-degree washing 
cycle which seemed to have only ‘a minimal effect’, unlike the current 
notes which can be ‘substantially degraded’.

They then ‘submerged them 
in liquids, including red wine,’ and found they could be wiped clean, 
unlike a normal note which stains or disintegrates.

Polymer
notes are already used in more than 20 countries, including Australia, 
New Zealand, Mexico, Singapore and Mauritius as well as in Canada.

Question remain unanswered over how cash machines will work with the new cash.

But
a spokesman for Link, the company which is behind 66,000 of Britain’s ATMs, said: ‘The ATM industry will work closely with the Bank 
to ensure their effective introduction.’

The
public consultation on the introduction of the new notes is due to 
finish on 15 November and a final decision will be announced in 
December.
