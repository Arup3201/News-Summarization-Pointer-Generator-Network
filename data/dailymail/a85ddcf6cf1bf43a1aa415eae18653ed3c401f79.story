A schoolboy with learning difficulties was hit with a 50,000-volt Taser by police at a special school.

Officers were called to Chelfham Senior School near Plymouth, a special needs school owned by the exclusive Priory Group following an alleged assault on a teacher in a 'scuffle' with pupils.

A 15-year-old was shot with the electric stun gun after several police units arrived at the school grounds to find three boys allegedly holding two knives.

Tasers: Armed officers threatened, targeted or discharged the 50,000-volt weapons against youngsters more than 320 times a year - an 11-fold increase from first year they were cleared for use against under-18s

Police confirmed last night that no officers were injured.

The male teacher in his late 40s suffered chest and facial injuries, which were not thought to be knife related.

The victim was treated at the scene by paramedics before being taken to Derriford Hospital.

Campaigners reacted with fury yesterday, saying the use of Taser on a vulnerable boy with a complex learning difficulty flouts the guidelines and may have been excessive.

The incident at the school, which specialises in children with learning difficulties including behavioural, emotional and social difficulties and autism, happened at 9.20pm on December 1, but police did not release any details at the time.

The day and residential school for boys and girls aged seven to 19 in the village of Bere Alston in the Devon countryside, is owned by the Priory Group, a private company known for its addiction clinics favoured by celebrities.

Yesterday Sophie Khan, a solicitor-advocate and legal director at Police Action Centre called for an inquiry. She said: 'The use of a Taser on this occasion has to be called into question. The police action may have been excessive.

'The use on children is only allowed if it is the only feasible method of restraining the child.

'It's only there if there are no other alternatives to restrain the child.

'Often officers can say they weren't aware of behaviour issues, but in this case they must have been aware.

'Using a Taser on someone suffering some kind of behavioural difficulty or disability is something the policy or guidance doesn't allow.' Yesterday Devon and Cornwall Police refused to comment on the case.

The three boys involved, two 14-year-olds and the 15-year-old have since been charged with affray.

The shocking incident comes after new figures revealed that Tasers are being used by police against children as young as 11 almost every day.

Armed officers threatened, targeted or discharged the 50,000-volt weapons against youngsters more than 320 times a year - an 11-fold increase from the first year they were cleared for use against under-18s in 2007.

In the first year of officers being cleared to Taser children, they were used just 29 times in England.

By 2011 - the latest year that figures are available - the total stood at 323.

It was not specified whether the guns were fired, or whether officers aimed them at children.

Experts say that even targeting a person using the weapon's laser red dot is threatening.

There have been a number of alarming cases involving the US-made weapons.

In July, Jordan Begley, 23, who had a suspected heart condition, died after being Tasered by police in Manchester.

Devon and Cornwall Police are being investigated by the police watchdog after Andrew Pimlott, 32, died from burns when he was Tasered after dousing himself in fuel in March this year.

Last October, blind Colin Farmer, 63, was Tasered in Chorley, Lancashire, when an officer mistook his white stick for a sword.

Eight other people have died after being Tasered since the weapons were introduced a decade ago.

The Police Federation wants all officers to have a Taser.

Yesterday a spokesperson for the school said: 'People responded to an isolated incident on the school grounds and as legal proceedings are ongoing it would be inappropriate to comment further.'

The three boys will appear at Plymouth Magistrates' Court on December 20.
