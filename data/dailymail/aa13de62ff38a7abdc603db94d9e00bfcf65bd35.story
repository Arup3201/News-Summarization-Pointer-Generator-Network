They then executed a search warrant on February 18 and seized several pounds of marijuana, dozens of bongs, grinders, pipes, rolling papers, scales and $26,230 in cash, court papers obtained by the The Tribune said.

In the basement, police found a pressure cooker with Dab inside, as well as glass tubes, a butane torch and numerous cans of butane.

Dab is made by extracting THC from cannabis using a butane torch.

The result is a gelatinous brown substance that is between 70 and 90 percent THC - much stronger than regular marijuana and much more expensive.

Robinson was arrested along with his sons, Alexander Jordan Robinson, 21, and Zachary Ryan Robinson, 19.
