Scott Cupit dances with his investor Deborah Meaden on ITV's Good Morning Britain

It's the programme where millions see aspiring entrepreneurs pitch to win over some of Britain’s most demanding financial backers.

To viewers of BBC2’s Dragons’ Den it would seem obvious that contestants have already fought a fierce battle to win a place on the show.

But now one former contestant has lifted the lid on the BBC’s selection process, saying he was first headhunted and then cajoled into taking part.

And The Mail on Sunday has since learned that he is far from alone – with nearly half the contestants on the current BBC2 series, 46 out of 97, having been similarly targeted.

Scott Cupit, who runs a swing dancing school, made his astounding revelation about the ‘selection’ process on his company website.

The 48-year-old says he was contacted out of the blue by the BBC and ‘talked into’ an audition.

For Mr Cupit, who appeared on the opening episode of the 12th series with members of his dance company, Swing Patrol, taking part could not have been more straightforward.

Once he bowed to the BBC’s entreaties, his only problem, he said, was having just ten days ‘to think about what on earth to ask for’, as he was happy with his business as it was and wasn’t seeking investment.

First, he held an urgent meeting with his accountant.

‘I memorised my figures and got to understand my business a lot better. That’s an area I neglect because it bores me,’ he said.

Then came his pitch: a swing nightclub. He entered the den dancing with six members of his troupe and invited the Dragons to join them.

His idea was dismissed by all the Dragons – including Duncan Bannatyne, Kelly Hoppen and Deborah Meaden. But, as Mr Cupit recognises, it made for a lively start to the new series, presumably what the producers intended. ‘They thought we would be a good balance for the TV because obviously the BBC want to put on a good show,’ Mr Cupit said.

And despite the resistance to his nightclub plan, Mrs Meaden – a former Strictly Come Dancing contestant – was impressed with the business generally, investing £65,000 in return for a 20 per cent stake.

The next morning, she danced with Mr Cupit on ITV’s Good Morning Britain and spoke enthusiastically about the venture.

In a video on his website, which has now been taken down, Mr Cupit said: ‘When I spoke to him [the BBC researcher] he asked if I would consider going on the show. I was really surprised; apparently lots of people put in application forms but they hand-pick certain groups. We had been recommended.

‘I was flattered but puzzled. They talked me into doing a screen test and I took some dancers and we went to West London. They said, “We’d love you to do it.” The only catch was I had ten days to be in front of the actual Dragons. After some consideration, I decided to go for it.’

Credited with bringing dances such as the Lindy Hop into the mainstream, Swing Patrol teaches 1,200 students every week at 27 venues across London and has featured on Blue Peter and Call The Midwife.

The practice has been greeted with dismay by other contestants. Former contestant Ray Duffy, co-owner of Mask-arade, a celebrity facemask company based in Southam, South Warwickshire, said it was deceptive. ‘We applied through the normal channels and I was not aware of these approaches. It is less entrepreneurial if you are cajoled into it.

‘The perception of the viewer is that the business pitching to the Dragons has gone about it in a normal manner by approaching the show, not the show approaching them.’

A BBC source admitted that Mr Cupit had been approached directly but said the producers dispute he was cajoled.

The BBC said: ‘As is made clear on the Dragons’ Den website, in order to showcase a wide cross-section of business ideas, there are many different ways that our production team source entrepreneurs and businesses to apply to take part.

‘Regardless of this, every applicant, without exception, goes through the same rigorous application and audition process.’
