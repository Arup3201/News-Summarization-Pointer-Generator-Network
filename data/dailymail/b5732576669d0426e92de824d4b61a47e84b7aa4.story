David Cameron says he is backing Britain as ‘a land of opportunity’ where profit and enterprise are not ‘dirty words’.

The Prime Minister will claim in his speech to the Conservative Party conference today that only the Tories will stand up for businesses that ‘get wages in people’s pockets and food on their tables’.

Attacking the ‘anti-business’ agenda laid out by Labour leader Ed Miliband last week, he will insist that enterprise, not a larger state, is the answer to Britain’s economic woes.

He will also make his frankest admission 
of the weaknesses of the Coalition, saying it is clear Britain needs a 
strong majority Government ‘with a clear mandate’ that is ‘accountable 
for what it promises’.

He will say the ‘great Conservative mission’ is 
to build a land of opportunity as the economy recovers.

But attempts to focus on the improving economy were dealt a blow last night when Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke said the ‘ordinary member of the public isn’t feeling much benefit’ because earnings were not going up in line with prices.

However, Mr Cameron insisted last night that Britain was ‘going from rescue to recovery’, adding: ‘The public understand the mess we were left... they know we have been doing a rescue mission.

'It is time for a  government with a stronger mandate and a clearer accountability, so you know that what you get in the manifesto happens in government.

‘That means a Conservative-only government.’

After last week’s pledge from Mr Miliband to intervene in the energy market, cancel a corporation tax cut, to freeze business rates, make some firms pay a higher minimum wage and penalise those that fail to take on apprentices, Mr Cameron will seek to cast the Labour leader as anti-business.

He will say: ‘Profit, wealth creation, tax cuts, enterprise are not dirty, elitist words, they’re not the problem. They really are the solution because it’s not government that creates jobs, it’s businesses.

‘There is no shortcut to a land of opportunity. You build it business by business, school by school, person by person, patiently, practically, painstakingly.

'And under-pinning it all is that deep, instinctive belief that if you trust people and give them the tools, they will succeed.

'This party at its heart is about big people, strong communities, responsible businesses, a bigger society – not a bigger state.

‘It’s how we’ve been clearing up the mess. So let’s stick with it and finish the job.

‘Our economy, our society, welfare, schools, all reformed, all rebuilt with one aim: To make this country a land of opportunity for all.

‘You don’t help people by leaving them on welfare, but by helping them stand on their own two feet. Why? Because the best way out of poverty is work and the dignity that brings.’
