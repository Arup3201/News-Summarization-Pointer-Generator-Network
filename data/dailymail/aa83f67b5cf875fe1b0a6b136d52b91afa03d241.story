A beauty queen has spent 24 hours living on the streets - to raise money for a homeless man who offered to pay for her cab fare.

Dominique Harrison-Bentzen went to pay for a taxi home after a night out in Preston, Lancashire, but discovered she had lost her card when she attempted to get money out.

The 22-year-old Miss Preston finalist was then approached by a homeless man who offered to give her the last of his money to get home safely.

The University of Central Lancashire student did not take the money but was so touched by the man's gesture that she set herself a mission to help him. 

The art student decided to spend a night sleeping rough on the streets to raise money to help Robbie get back on his feet.

The fundraising effort has touched the hearts of thousands on social media - including Ian Brown, who took to Twitter to show his support - and Ms Harrison-Bentzen has already managed to raise nearly £25,000. 

She said: 'I suddenly realised that I had no money and a homeless man approached me with his only change of £3. 

'He insisted I took it to pay for a taxi to make sure I got home safe.'

'I ended up posting a status on Facebook to try and find him the next day and it turns out I'm not the only person he has helped.'

Identified only as 'Robbie' the man appears to have come to the aid of many in Preston city centre, returning wallets to pedestrians and offering his scarf to keep people warm.

The student decided to spend a night sleeping rough on the streets to raise money to help Robbie get back on his feet. 

Ms Harrison-Bentzen said: 'He has been homeless for seven months through no fault of his own and he can't get work due to having no address.

'It took me four nights of driving round Preston to find him and I was beginning to lose hope that I would see him again, to thank him personally for his kindness. Luckily I had my mum and her car to help me.'

The fundraiser was back by thousands - including Ian Brown, the lead singer of the Stone Roses who retweeted a message of support

She met Robbie in the early hours of December 4. Four days later she found him again and the next day, December 9, she went live with her Facebook and fundraising posts and the money started rolling in.

'I can't just simply give him the money, I have to go through the right channels so I will be spending 24 hours through the day and night as a homeless person to understand the difficulties they face each day.

'I need everyone's help, please sponsor me £3 - as Robbie attempted to give me his only £3 - in the hope of collecting enough to get Robbie a flat deposit.' 

The fundraiser was back by thousands - including Ian Brown, the lead singer of the Stone Roses who retweeted a message of support. 

'It's just so overwhelming the response I've had,' said Ms Harrison-Bentzen. 

 'Everyone has been so supportive and I'd love to get as many people as possible out with me to show Robbie our support - be it for the full 24 hours or just one.

'I hope my campaign will help people think a little more about the people around them, Christmas is a good time to think about other people.

'If people can see what I am doing then maybe they can take the time to just stop and talk to a homeless person, hear their story.'
