It was the most high profile 
modelling moment of 2012 when ten-year-old Romeo Beckham was unveiled as 
the star of Burberry's Spring/Summer 2013 campaign alongside Cara Delevingne and Edie Campbell.

Chief Creative Officer Christopher Bailey famously
said the youngster 'stole she show' during the photoshoot, 
despite it being his first professional job.

And now, the King of Burberry has spoken out again to praise the budding model's
'impeccable taste' in clothing.

Good taste runs in the family: Burberry's Chief Creative Officer Christopher Bailey has spoken out about Romeo Beckham's 'impeccable taste' ahead of the London Collection: Men's show this afternoon

Bailey revealed that fashion designer Victoria's son is just as enamored with a passion for fashion as she is.

He enthused: 'Romeo loves fashion, completely loves it. He had a real opinion; he was so involved in what he was wearing.

'And he was so well-mannered and humble - he would never say, "I don't like this", but he would say, "Hmm, maybe something else". He has impeccable taste.'

It was a risk using such a young model on the shoot - which also starred British beauties Cara Delevingne and Edie Campbell - but Christopher believes Romeo is a credit to his parents David and Victoria and made the experience a 'dream'.

Entertainer: Young Beckham entertained the likes of Cara Delevingne on set and it is no wonder that Bailey said he 'stole she show' despite it being his first professional job

Passion for fashion: Bailey said the youngster had a great eye for clothes and would give his own style input when it came to dressing for the shoot 

The fashion mogul added in an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper: 'He was an absolute dream to work with. Honestly, he is the sweetest - genuinely, so well brought up.

'I've known Victoria and those guys for quite a long time; they are just lovely, grounded, gentle, well-mannered little kids.'

Christopher also shared some kind words about It-girl of the moment Cara Delevingne, who has been recently grabbing showbiz headlines for the wrong reasons.

He said: 'Cara is uber professional. She enjoys it. She has no airs and graces at all, and she is very kind.'

Bailey was speaking on the day of the Burberry Prorsum menswear show, which has returned from Milan to London and was showcased as part of London Collections: Men. 

The star-studded front row saw Tinie Tempah, Dermot O'Leary, Douglas Booth and Suki Waterhouse gather to marvel the colour cropped macs and strong knits in summer sorbots.

Complimentary: He also described Cara Delevingne, posing here in her first Burberry campaign with Eddie Redmayne in 2012, as uber professional and very kind
