Aaron Collis, 28, was sent to prison in 2009 after committing sexual offences against 22 children as young as 18-months-old

A paedophile nursery worker jailed for abusing children has demanded he is chemically castrated to prevent him reoffending.

Aaron Collis, 28, was sent to prison in 2009 after committing sexual offences against 22 children as young as 18-months-old.

But now in a desperate letter to prisoner newspaper ‘Inside Time’ Collis has begged the authorities to allow him to be castrated

Collis claims the procedure - designed to reduce libido and sexual activity - is the only thing that could stop him abusing children again.

In 2012 around 100 paedophiles were chemically castrated under a voluntary Government scheme to stop them reoffending.

The father-of-two claims prison rehabilitation and treatment programmes for sex offenders 'won’t make a bit of difference.'

In the letter to the February edition Collis wrote: 'I am only speaking for myself because I know my own mind, I know my triggers and I know that the SOTP [Sex Offenders’ Treatment Programme] alone is simply not going to lower my risk.

Collis said he has spoken to medical experts but has not been successful.

He wrote: 'I thought they would jump at the chance to take away my sex drive, but I was very wrong.'

'They all seem to be trying to talk me out of it, telling me I’m young and it’s not necessary.'

'Well, I’m sorry, but it’s my body and my messed up brain which is dangerous and this is my decision.'I’m not going to let this go, even if I have to go to the European Court of Human Rights. I will be a free man in a few years and this is a huge factor in deciding how bright my future will be.'

Collis, who is in HMP Peterborough, was handed an indeterminate sentence with a minimum of five years at Cambridge Crown Court in 2009.

Chemical castration involves a man taking hormones that suppress the production of testosterone, leading to a decreased sex drive.

The medication is intended for use on those with compulsive or impulsive urges to offend and those who have difficulties in controlling sexual arousal, intrusive sexual fantasies or urges, sadism or other 'dangerous' tendencies such as necrophilia.

One drug used, leuprorelin (marketed as Prostap) inhibits the typically high sex drives of paedophiles by limiting the production of testosterone.

But the manufacturers admit it is likely that 'only small numbers of sex offenders will benefit from these treatments.'

Poland introduced mandatory chemical castration for some sex offenders in 2009, it was introduced in South Korea in September and Russia and Moldova are following suit.

Both Germany and the Czech Republic have been criticised by Europe's top human rights body for using voluntary surgical castration to treat sex offenders.

In 2012, Collis was brought back before a judge at the same court after admitting 12 further offences.

The court was told Collis had written to paedophile Vanessa George offering her 'support' and admitted he was envious of her 'notoriety'.

The judge was told Collis also claimed he was in love with one of the four-year-old girls he targeted and it felt like he was being unfaithful  when he abused other girls.

He was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence to serve a minimum of five years - resetting the clock on his minimum required time to serve.

Collis worked at Snap! Nursery in Chesterton, Cambridgeshire and the Funky Fun House play centre in Abbey, Cambridgeshire.

But none of his crimes were committed at either of his workplaces.

Chemical castration is not unneard of in Britain -  two years ago dozens of sex offenders volunteered to take drugs designed to stifle their libido during a pilot experiment at HMP Whatton in Nottinghamshire.

The drug reduces their testosterone levels to that of a prepubescent boy for a three-month period. After that, it wears off.

Those in the trial included rapist Neil Wilkinson, who later killed his cellmate, and Barry Wade, who was jailed for seven years for offences against two young girls.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said at the time: 'We support the use of pharmaceutical interventions for high risk sex offenders given the evidence that it can be useful in reducing risk for some perpetrators.'

The drug is already mandatory for child sex offenders in Poland, Russia and certain U.S. states.

Chemical castration can cut the rates of reoffending from 40 per cent to five per cent, according to researchers in Scandinavia.

'Why is it so hard to convince people what is best for my own rehabilitation? The so-called experts are obsessed with these silly courses which cannot possibly work on someone like me.

'I am a 28 year-old sex offender who has always openly admitted his crimes from the word go.

'I hate what I have done and for 4 years now I’ve been in the prison system trying to find a ‘cure’ for the incurable.

'I found a solution a while back and have been exploring it ever since, but for some reason I am finding it nearly impossible to convince people that chemical castration is the best thing for me and it’s my best hope of an offence-free future.

'I am only speaking for myself because I know my own mind, I know my triggers and I know that the SOTP alone is simply not going to lower my risk.

'I’ve spoken to doctors, nurses, psychologists, OMU and various medical ‘experts’ about the possibility of being chemically castrated, but to no avail. I thought they would jump at the chance to take away my sex drive, but I was very wrong.

'They all seem to be trying to talk me out of it, telling me I’m young and it’s not necessary.

'Well, I’m sorry, but it’s my body and my messed up brain which is dangerous and this is my decision. I’ve thought a lot about it and I really want to give it a try, but it’s so difficult even to get assessed for it - WHY? These crappy courses won’t make a bit of difference to me.

'I have family and friends who have stuck by me, they and my children deserve better and this I feel is definitely worth trying. I’m still doing the prison courses but I just wish that people would respect the fact that I am an adult and it’s my body.

'I’m not going to let this go, even if I have to go to the European Court of Human Rights. I will be a free man in a few years and this is a huge factor in deciding how bright my future will be.'
