A bridal shop in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania is causing outrage in their local community and online after they refused to sell wedding dresses to a lesbian couple.

One of the disturbed brides to be, who didn't want to be identified, wrote a Facebook post about W-W Bridal's unfair treatment towards them based solely on their sexual orientation.

The status read, 'I was put on hold for about five minutes so that the lady could get her appointment book. She took me off hold and said unfortunately she would not be able to schedule an appointment for us because they currently do not service same sex couples and it's just not something they do.'

Won't service homosexuals: W W Bridal in Pennsylvania won't sell dresses to same sex couples

The store's owner Victoria Miller says she denied the lesbian couple dresses because of her Christian religion.

'We feel we have to answer to God for what we do, and providing those two girls dresses for a sanctified marriage would break God’s law,' store owner Victoria Miller, who identifies as Christian, told the Press Enterprise.

Miller's lawyer Al Luschas has said that in the state of Pennsylvania stores are allowed to refuse service based on religious beliefs.

The New York Daily News reports that Luschas' client has a 'liberty interest' in refusing to be involved in a wedding that violates her 'firmly and honestly held religious beliefs.'

People all over the United States took to Yelp and Facebook to give their opinion on the matter.

'Homophobic bigots, spend your money with a company that has open hearts and minds! They turned away a couple just because they happen to be lesbians.  They probably have an issue with interracial marriage as well. Love is about hearts, not parts!' writes Jake H.

'Bigotry at its finest, If you're divorced, Not a virgin, Talked back to your parents ,Eaten Shellfish,Of another religion e.t.c. don't come here they have the ability to turn you away because of their "right to discriminate disguised as religious freedom,' said Nicole J.

Others with a more conservative bent took to Facebook and stood up for the institution.

'Stick to your beliefs even in the face of opposition. It amazes me how people say that we are all entitled to our own beliefs, but that doesn't apply if you don't agree with theirs. God will bless you greatly for staying true to His Word.'Despite Pennsylvania’s prevalence of homophobia, it still became the last North-eastern state to allow gay marriages in May.
