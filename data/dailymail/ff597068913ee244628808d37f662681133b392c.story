A nine-year-old schoolboy has been banned from classes because his 'extreme' short back and sides hair style is too long.

Billy Eddleston, from Darwen, Lancashire, has been sent home for three days running over his hair, which his headmistress says is too long on the top.

Billy, who says plenty of his friends at Hoddlesden St Paul's CE Primary School have the popular hair style, will not be allowed to return to classes until he has had his hair cut again.

'Disgrace': Billy cannot return to Hoddlesden St Paul's CE Primary School until he has had another haircut, but the nine-year-old says his friends have the same hairstyle

His mother Connie Eddleston, 30, a self-employed painter and decorator, has branded the decision a 'disgrace'.

She said: 'Billy has had the same haircut, in varying lengths, pretty much his whole life.

'I feel like Billy's been victimised, and he feels picked on. I feel like the school is failing my child.

'It won't stop him learning. If he gets it shorter he'll look like a thug. He's losing out on his education.'

Mrs Eddleston first received a letter about Billy's hair before he broke up for Christmas.

She admits that she tried to cut her son's hair herself, but she had to take him to the barbers to get it fixed because it was 'a mess'. 

Hoddlesden St Paul’s CE Primary School's prospectus says its rules on pupils hairstyles are: 

'Shoulder length hair must be tied back. 

'We have a no extreme or ‘current trend’ hair policy at our school.

'Plain red headband/headwear for girls and no hair gel for girls or boys.'

The mother-of-four said: 'He walked through the [school] doors on Monday and not a word was said. On Tuesday the head collared me and said it was still too long on the top and could I deal with it.

'I took him straight from school to the barbers and had it done. On Wednesday both the head and the deputy head were waiting for us and he was sent home.

'On Thursday and Friday I got him ready for school as normal, made him a packed lunch and put on his uniform and the same thing happened. I can't understand, it's just a short back and sides.

'He has to watch his sisters Isobel, eight, and Olivia, six, walk through the gate in the morning and the head teacher waits for him and tells him he can't come in. It's so trivial.

'I have considered getting his hair cut again, but it's the principle of the thing now. I want them to apologise to my son.'

Billy's parents John and Connie Eddleston say the ban is unfair, with Mrs Eddleston branding the school's decision a 'disgrace'

Billy, who has now missed three days of school, says he feels like his teachers are 'bullying' him

The school's prospectus states: 'Shoulder length hair must be tied back. We have a no extreme or 'current trend' hair policy at our school. Plain red headband/headwear for girls and no hair gel for girls or boys.'

Despite this, Billy has not been allowed to classes and it is still unclear whether he will be able to attend on Monday morning. 

Billy, who also lives with his father, engineering manager John, 33, and brother Edward, two, said: 'I feel like the school are bullying me. There are other boys with the same hair design and they are allowed to stay.'

Mrs Eddleston will meet with headmistress Bernadette Bickerton, as well as the school's governors and an educational welfare officer from  Darwen Council on Wednesday to discuss the matter further.

Head teacher Bernadette Bickerton said: 'Billy has not been [permanently] excluded from the school and we hope to see him back in class as soon as possible so any disruption to his education is kept to a minimum.

'Both parents and pupils are made aware of our high expectations and aspirations before they choose the school and we have a very clear uniform policy.'

Billy is not the first boy to be admonished for allegedly breaking the rules on hairstyles, but these two boys were punished for their short back and sides not being long enough.

Kyle Gibbs was separated from his classmates and told he would not be allowed to socialise with his friends in December after teachers ruled that his short back and sides was not long enough.

The Year 9 pupil, 13, at Churchdown Academy, Gloucestershire, had to work on his own in a classroom from 8am until 5pm until his hair reached an 'acceptable length'.

His father Colin, from lmbridge, Gloucester, said the school's decision was 'madness' and insisted the young footballer's haircut is 'neat and tidy and totally unremarkable'.

Meanwhile Jack Littlewood, 13, was punished with 'isolation' at his school in Wardley, Greater Manchester, in October, also because his short back and sides cut was deemed to be too short.

His furious mother Amanda Brown insisted the youngster has thick hair and wears it short to stop it from becoming unruly. 

Despite the outrage of his parents, Kyle was told school policy stated that his hair cannot be any shorter than a grade two.
