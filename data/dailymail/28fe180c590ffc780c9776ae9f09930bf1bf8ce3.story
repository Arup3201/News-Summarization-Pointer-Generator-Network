Chicago Bears defensive tackle Henry Melton has been arrested and charged with public intoxication and assault.

The six-foot-three, 295-pound lineman allegedly punched the manager of the Chill Sports Bar and Grill in Grapevine, Texas, in the face and bit his arm at 1:45am Monday morning.

It reportedly took four waitstaff to restrain Melton, 27, until police arrived.

According to the Star Telegram, Melton was asked to leave the bar and restaurant after becoming belligerent and abusing staff.

He then became involved in an altercation with the manager during which he punched the man and bit his arm.

Robert Eberling, spokesman for the Grapevine Police Department, said the pro-footballer refused treatment for a cut he sustained on his nose.

He posted $1210 bail and was released from prison this morning.

Melton's agent, Jordan Woy, told ESPN.com that his client has acknowledged getting into an argument with a bartender but says he is innocent of assault.

'It's still preliminary, and we're looking into everything,' Woy told ESPN.com. 'But Henry said he didn't do anything. He said he didn't throw a punch at anybody and that he got jumped by a couple of bouncers on the way out.'

A witness told ESPN.com that Melton 'didn't really do anything.'

A spokesperson for the Chicago Bear said they are seeking more information about the incident.

'We are aware of the reports regarding Henry Melton,' the team said in a statement. 'We are currently gathering information to learn more about the circumstances surrounding the arrest.'

Melton is out for the season after tearing his left anterior cruciate ligament September 22 against Pittsburgh.
