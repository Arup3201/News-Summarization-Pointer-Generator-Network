Rafael Nadal’s season plunged to a new low when he was dismissed from the Miami Open 2015 by one of those compatriots he usually defeats for a pastime.

After Andy Murray had earlier eased through to the fourth round, the World No 3 floated limply away on the brisk Florida breeze, desperately inconsistent in going down 6-4 2-6 6-3 defeat to World No 34 Fernando Verdasco.

He was in decent company because another top player in Murray’s half of the draw, Stan Wawrinka, also perished. The 27 year-old Scot is the survivor on that side after a comfortable 6-3 6-4 victory over Colombia’s Santiago Giraldo, and he now meets South African Kevin Anderson.

Verdasco rarely looked threatened by Nadal, whose season has hit a new low after the defeat

Nadal has a lot of thinking to do following his defeat to 31 year-old left-hander Verdasco, who had only beaten him once in fourteen previous meetings. 

Only when the challenger seemed to get flustered after missing an early break in the second set was the French Open champion able to assert his normal superiority.

The former World No 1 was troubled with wrist, back problems and appendicitis that caused him to miss much of last season’s second half. But he has played a full schedule in 2015, in which he has only reached one final, winning the relatively low-key ATP clay event last month in Buenos Aires.

The question is whether the constant strains on his body are finally catching up with him at 28, although he has stuttered before at this time of year before coming storming back on the European clay, where has been undisputed king for 10 years.

Once he had reeled in the second set the expectation was that Verdasco might fade, but after a long toilet break he reasserted himself and found that Nadal’s was in generous mood.

His feared forehand was particularly awry, and whole movement less assured than usual, never able to take advantage of his opponent’s potential nerves.

Nadal maintained afterwards that he was unconcerned about his body, and that it was more an issue of his confidence being low: 'The physical problems are past. I am in competition. I'm playing weeks in a row, it is not an excuse,' he said.

'I don't have this self confidence that when I hit the ball I’m going to hit the ball where I want to hit it, to go for the ball running and knowing that my position will be the right one. I need to fix my nerves and my self-control.'
