Hillary Clinton is the most admired woman in history, and Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey and Queen Elizabeth II didn't even get a look in.

The Secretary of State won the prestigious accolade for the 17th time last year - smashing the Gallup Poll record books.

She first won the honor, which is based on a poll that asks Americans to name their most admired man and woman living in any part of the world, in 1993, when her husband Bill Clinton became President.

In 1995 and 1996, the 65-year-old finished second to Mother Teresa and in 2001 she was 
runner up to Laura Bush. But her victories have been uninterrupted since.

'Hillary Clinton's first-place finish this year further solidifies her position as the most often named 'Most Admired Woman' in Gallup's history -- a total of 17 times going back to her first year as first lady in 1993,' Gallup said on Monday.

Eleanor
 Roosevelt is the second most admired woman in Gallup poll's 52-year history, with 13 wins, while
 Margaret Thatcher won six times and Jacqueline Kennedy won the award 
five times.

Dwight Eisenhower is the 
Most Admired Man in history with 12 wins, while Ronald Reagan and Bill 
Clinton are joint runners up with eight.

Neither her recent illness or the deadly Benghazi attack prevented Hillary Clinton being voted Most Admired Woman in 2012.

She finished with 21 
per cent of the vote, while Mrs Obama came in a distant second with five
 per cent of Americans naming her as the woman they most admired.

Her husband, however, did win the top spot in the men's race - for his fifth time.

A third of voters named President Barack Obama as their Most Admired Man in 2012, followed by Nelson Mandela who commanded 3 per cent of the vote.

Last year, four of the top 10 Most Admired Women came from the world of American politics - Clinton, Obama, Condolezza Rice, who finished fourth, and Palin.

Doing her bit for women in entertainment, Oprah Winfrey achieved third place, attracting four per cent of the vote.

Two women with international advocacy
 causes - Malala Yousafzai and Aung San Suu Kyi - made the top 10 for 2012 while Britain's former Prime Minister, Margaret
 Thatcher, came in at number eight.

Queen Elizabeth II and Kate Middleton were the only royalty to make the list.

TV and film stars and businessmen were 
missing from the Most Admired Man ranking. The list was distinctly 
politics heavy last year, which is not surprising given the Presidential
 election in November.

Republican presidential candidate Mitt
 Romney came in third place behind Obama and Mandela. He was followed by
 Rev. Billy Graham, George W. Bush, Pope Benedict XVI, Bill Clinton and 
The Dalai Lama. George H.W. Bush, Ron Paul and John McCain tied in ninth
 place.

The Most Admired Man list for 2011 included Warren Buffet, Donald Trump and Bill Gates.
