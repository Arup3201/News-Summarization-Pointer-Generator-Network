Service: 111 was introduced this spring to provide non-emergency medical advice 24 hours a day

The NHS 111 helpline was plunged deeper into crisis last night after a contractor responsible for up to 20million patients suddenly pulled-out due to ‘financial problems’.

NHS Direct said it would be terminating all 11 of its contracts after admitting it had racked up debts of £26million – and said running the helpline was ‘financially unsustainable’.

There are concerns the taxpayer now faces a huge new bill to bail out the helpline as the NHS Direct contracts may end up being re-drawn to pay for higher numbers of staff.

Two reviews which are due to report back this autumn could demand that the system employs higher numbers of nurses as well as call centre handlers.

It is the latest controversy to blight the 111 service, which was launched in April to provide patients with a simple way of seeking medical advice round-the-clock.

It was hampered by problems from the start with reports of critically ill patients waiting hours for a doctor and ambulances sent out needlessly for period pains and hangovers.

Response: The call centres are manned typically by around 60 unqualified workers and up to 15 nurses. Staff numbers decline dramatically during the unpopular night and weekend shifts (file picture)

The lines are manned by unqualified 
workers – some even including teenagers – with just two weeks’ training,
who transfer more serious calls on to a handful of nurses seated 
nearby.

The crisis engulfing 111 has piled the pressure on Dame Barbara Hakin (right), deputy chief executive of the NHS, who is meant to be overseeing the helpline.

One of the most powerful women in the NHS, she was promoted into the £120,000 role in March – despite accusations that she gagged whistleblowers and attempted to cover up hospital death rates.

The 60-year-old former GP is being investigated by the General Medical Council over claims that she shelved an investigation into needless patient deaths at United Lincolnshire Hospitals three years ago.

She is also accused of trying to sack whistleblower Gary Walker, the chief executive of the trust, who was trying to raise concerns that patients were at risk.

If found guilty she could be struck off as a doctor, although she no longer practises.

Dame Barbara, who was made a dame in 2009 for her ‘services to healthcare’ was appointed to be deputy chief executive by the much-criticised head of the NHS, Sir David Nicholson, without consulting Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt.

NHS Direct is also understood to have 
underestimated the number of staff, including nurses, that it would need
to field the calls. It has since been forced to hire many more staff 
just to make the service safe which has drastically increased the 
running costs.

Furthermore, it originally based its 
bids on a projected payment of £13 a call to cover costs. But rates were
cut by NHS bosses to between £7 and £8.

Yesterday the organisation, which runs
NHS 111 in 11 of the 46 areas of England, announced it was terminating 
its contracts, which cover areas including Manchester, South London, the
West Midlands, Merseyside, Cheshire and Somerset. Its announcement came
as:

The remaining NHS 111 contracts are run by the private firm Harmoni, the ambulance service and other health service bodies.

NHS bosses have been holding talks 
with local ambulance services and GP organisations to find bodies to 
take over the 11 NHS Direct contracts.

Both David Cameron and health minister
Lord Howe insisted patient safety would remain ‘paramount’ and said NHS
Direct would continue to run the service for the next few months.

Lord Howe said 111 was performing well
despite ‘teething problems’ in some areas as he accused NHS Direct of 
getting their sums ‘very wrong’.

He claimed problems with the service were mainly confined to the West Country, Kent, Surrey and Sussex.

‘For the vast majority of the country 
the service is excellent,’ he said, adding: ‘NHS Direct bid for a 
service at a price they thought they could meet, and they got it very 
wrong.’

Former Labour health secretary John 
Reid said 111 was in ‘turmoil’. Addressing the House of Lords, he added:
‘The deterioration in our accident and emergency services is getting 
exponentially greater. Trolley waits are back and predicted to 
potentially reach crisis point.’

The 111 helpline is currently being 
reviewed by NHS England – the body in charge of running the health 
service – and by the NHS’s medical director Sir Bruce  Keogh. Both are 
due to report back in September.
