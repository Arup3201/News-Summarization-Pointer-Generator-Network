Rafa Benitez has indicated he may spend the next 10 years at Napoli and snub any move by Tottenham to lure him back to the Barclays Premier League.

The former Liverpool and Chelsea manager led Napoli to the Italian Cup in his first season in charge but has been linked with a return to England.

But the Spaniard insisted he is happy to remain in Naples.

Staying put: Rafa Benitez insists he could stay at Napoli for the next 10 years

‘It was a positive year and we can be even stronger next year,’ he told reporters.

‘I like scoring a lot because it shows that you have a proactive mentality and we have the third best defence in the division, despite a lot of criticism.

‘That means that we have found our balance over time and we play a quality game. You must add to that we’ve qualified for Europe for a fifth straight year and this is a very important milestone.

‘We have worked a lot and we had a better transfer market than anyone else in Serie A. We lowered the average age of the team by two years and we have many important players for the future in the team.

‘I work for the team but also for the club to create a structure for the long term. I live season by season but I may well stay here for 10 years.’
