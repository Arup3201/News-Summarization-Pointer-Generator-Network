Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is set to hand Arsene Wenger a major fitness boost ahead of Sunday's crunch clash against Liverpool.

The England star was viewed as a key doubt for the visit to Anfield this weekend after injuring a groin in Saturday's win over Newcastle.

But both Arsenal and Oxlade-Chamberlain are growing increasingly confident that he'll be fit for Sunday.

The midfielder will continue to be assessed between now and Sunday but Wenger is hopeful of being able to name the former Southampton man alongside Mathieu Flamini in central midfield at the weekend.

The news reduces the chances of Wenger being forced into playing a makeshift midfield against the Reds due to a string of injuries.

Jack Wilshere and Aaron Ramsey are both out, leaving Wenger to consider playing Santi Cazorla in a deep role alongside Flamini with Lukas Podolski out wide.

Oxlade-Chamberlain, meanwhile, has admitted that he and the rest of the Gunners squad must take some of the blame for their poor form.

Speaking to the Evening Standard, the former Southampton star said: 'From my point of view, Arsene Wenger is an unbelievable man off the pitch and as a manager. He's been brilliant for me and I can say that for a number of players at this club.

'He has helped us massively and so it is not just him to blame when things go wrong.

'It is us as well as footballers to take responsibility but he would say the same thing. I am sure he will take responsibility because that's what a great manager he is.

'All of us need to work together to make things go the right way and we are trying to do that.'Â
