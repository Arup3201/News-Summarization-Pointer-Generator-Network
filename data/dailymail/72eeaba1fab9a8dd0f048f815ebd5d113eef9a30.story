Arsenal have signed Southampton right-back Calum Chambers in a £12million deal.

The highly-rated 19-year-old has only made 23 first team appearances for Southampton but Arsenal have seen enough to recognise his potential.

Chambers becomes the third player after Theo Walcott in 2006 and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in 2011 to swap the south coast for north London.

Highly-rated: 19-year-old Chambers has only made 23 first team appearances for Southampton

Calum Chambers is the third player in recent years to leave Southampton for Arsenal.

Calum Chambers (July 2014): £12m

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (August 2011): £12m initial payment which could rise to £15m with add-ons

Theo Walcott (January 2006): £9.1m. Original fee was £5m down, £5m depending on club appearances and £2m based on England appearances. It was later revised to £9.1m by a compromise agreement in March 2008.

Sportsmail understands that manager Arsene Wenger plans to convert Chambers in to a centre back in the long term.

Wenger is impressed with the defender's versatility and it is hoped that in time he could become as influential as former captain Tony Adams.

Chambers said: 'I am so happy to be 
signing for Arsenal. They are a team I have much admired for their 
playing style, and a team who have been one of the top sides in Europe 
for many years. I'm looking forward to joining up with my new team-mates
 today and beginning preparation for the season ahead.

'I would like 
to take this opportunity to say thank you to everyone at Southampton FC 
for everything they have done for me and for making this move possible.'

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger added: 'We are very pleased that Calum has agreed to join us. The way he adapted to the Premier League last season with Southampton at a young age shows that he has tremendous quality. He has a lot of the attributes that we look for in a young player and I am sure that he will do well with us.'

The defender is with his new team-mates in Austria, with keeper Wojciech Szczesny posting a welcome picture and message of himself, Chambers and Oxlade-Chamberlain on the team bus.

Chambers will fight for a first-spot with  Mathieu 
Debuchy, who Arsenal signed from Newcastle for £10m after Bacary Sagna joined Manchester City. His arrival means Carl Jenkinson may now leave the Emriates with Hull and West Ham interested in him.

Chambers is another product of Southampton's fruitful academy and has been a regular with England U19s. 

He has signed for an initial £12m - the same price Arsenal paid for Oxlade-Chamberlain - but his fee could eventually rise to £16m in add-ons. Oxlade-Chamberlain's fee could rise to £15m, while Walcott's eventual fee was £9.1m.

Chambers is the latest player to leave Southampton, who have already sold Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren to Liverpool for a combined £48m while Luke Shaw has moved to Manchester United.

Au revoir: Bacary Sagna decided to swap Arsenal for Manchester City earlier this summer

Moving on: Dejan Lovren signed for Liverpool from Southampton in a £20m deal on Sunday

But executive director Les Reed claims the club were disappointed to lose Chambers and remain commited to signing new players: He said:

'We are naturally disappointed whenever any of our Academy graduates leave the club, and that is very much the case with Calum’s departure.

'Calum made it clear to us that he did not see his future at Southampton. As such, it was crucial that we were able to negotiate a substantial fee that also reflects the work our staff have put into Calum’s development since he joined the club at the age of eight.

'Our position remains unchanged in that we are determined to keep our best young players at the club, as is evidenced by the decision to award Harrison Reed a new long-term contract last week, adding to the list of committed young professionals like James Ward Prowse, Sam Gallagher, Jack Stephens, Jordan Turnbull, Matt Targett, Sam McQueen and others who have seen plenty of first-team activity recently.

'We have an abundance of talent in the Academy coming through, and everybody at the club is continuing to work hard on bringing in quality new players as we build a team capable of taking us further forward in the coming seasons.

'It is important in the transfer window to remain calm, resilient and above all patient. We have targets, and we are working hard to get them across the line.'

Southampton are braced for a bid from Tottenham for Morgan Schneiderlin while Cardiff City have offered £3m for Jose Fonte and Inter Milan want bad boy striker Dani Osvaldo.
