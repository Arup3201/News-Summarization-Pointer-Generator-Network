Top seed Novak Djokovic made it through to the semi-finals of the Australian open after his victory on Wednesday night, but his biggest fan was cheering from thousands of kilometres away from his baby seat at home.

During his game against eighth seed Milos Raonic, in which the 27-year-old came on top with a score of 7-6, 6-4, 6-2, Djokovic's wife shared a snap of their rugged up three-month-old son watching his father play on the Melbourne courts.

'Ajde tatice! Come on daddy!' Jelena Djokovic wrote alongside the picture she Tweeted.

Djokovic, who was only made aware of the photo during his post-victory interview on the court, told the crowds: 'see how he enjoys watching TV? He's daddy's boy definitely'.

Smiling up at the photograph which was broadcast on the huge screens at the Rod Laver Arena, the Serbian player added: 'I didn't know he was watching me this way, but I felt his energy and that definitely helped me tonight.'

Stefan Djokovic was born in October last year, four months after Djokovic and his wife tied the knot following the tennis champion's Wimbledon win.

Unable to refrain from cracking a joke or two, the star delighted the crowds and his coach with his usual quit wit following the Wednesday victory. 

Asked about whether  his coach Boris Becker's temporary absence from his seat  during the game concerned him, Djokovic replied: 'Let me think of how I'm going to answer this question.'

'Like everyone he has a need to go to the toilet which I understand. But not in the first game or the third set Boris, please.'

He added in jest, 'but in the moment I had a break point and I thought he was guilty for me not using that break point.'

Djokovic is now set to face defending champion Stan Wawrinka  in the semi-finals on Friday after Wawrinka continued his impressive title defence with a straight-sets win over Japan's Kei Nishikori in the quarter-finals.

Djokovic beat Wawrinka 12-10 in the fifth set in a fourth-round clash before claiming his third straight title in 2013, but Wawrinka ended the world No 1's 25-match unbeaten run in Melbourne in the quarter-finals last year, winning 9-7 in the fifth.

'The crowd are definitely expecting a marathon like the last couple of years and I am sure both of us will give our best to perform the best possible tennis,' Djokovic said in the on-court interview.

'We always ask from each other the most of our own abilities on the court so I am looking forward to it.'

Djokovic, who has not dropped a set on the way to the semi-finals and only lost his serve once, added: 'It was a great performance, definitely no complaints.

'I returned very well, tried to get as many balls back in play. Some games I had to just let it go and wait for the opportunities and when they are presented obviously try to use them and that's what I've done.

'There are not many tournaments where I have just dropped serve once so I should enjoy it. It feels like Boris Becker on the court. Now I know how he feels.'

Earlier in the day, Wawrinka defeated fifth seed Nishikori 6-3 6-4 7-6 (8/6) in two hours and four minutes and has dropped just one set in making the last four.

Nishikori had won their previous encounter, also in the quarter-finals of a grand slam, in five sets on his way to the final of the US Open at Flushing Meadows last year.

But fourth seed Wawrinka dominated today's match from the outset and his only nervous moments came when Nishikori saved five match points from 6-1 down in the tie-break.

'I am still nervous at the end of the tie-break,' admitted Wawrinka, who eventually took his sixth match point with his 20th ace. 'It's never easy. He is returning well and you have to go for it.

'I was a little bit defensive but I am happy to get through.'

Asked about his approach to the tournament in an on-court interview, Wawrinka added: 'I don't come back to defend, I don't come back to win again. I come back to start a new grand slam

'There is no easy match (in the semi-final), it's going to be a tough one but so far I am playing well and am so happy to be back and playing the semi-final again.'

Nishikori admitted he paid for a slow start and could regret an audacious attempted drop shot which gave Wawrinka his sixth match point.

'I started to feel more comfortable in the third set, especially after I found out that I could go a little more aggressive than the first and second set,' the 25-year-old said.

'I was mixing up serve and volleys. My serve was much better than first couple sets because I was making more first serves.

'I was struggling my serve and that's why I couldn't get a good rhythm in the first and second set.

'The tie-breaker was really close. If I could get that one, it might change the whole thing. But, you know, he was serving really well until end of the set.

'So I think I have to give him credit. He obviously played really aggressive and played great tennis.'
