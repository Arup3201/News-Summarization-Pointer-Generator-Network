An Argentina versus Germany World Cup Final was hardly unlikely given each team had their own Pope behind them - even if both men have vowed to remain neutral. 

During the 1986 World Cup, Argentina had 'the hand of God' in the form of Diego Maradona, however, in 2014, the South American team can call on the support of God's right-hand man.

However, Pope Francis from Argentina is known as a fanatical football fan but he has been remarkably diplomatic during the month-long football tournament.   

Pope Francis, left, and his predecessor Pope Benedict, right, from Argentina and Germany respectively, have announced that they do not plan to take sides during Sunday's World Cup Final between their native countries 

The football mad Argentine pontiff has repeatedly said he is remaining neutral during the month-long competition.

His German predecessor, Pope Benedict is not considered a sports fan and prefers intellectual pursuits rather than football.

Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said Sunday's final is on quite late and it is unlikely that Pope Francis and his predecessor will meet up for the match. 

Diego Maradona, left, was branded the 'Hand of God' after the 1986 World Cup after punching the ball over England keeper Peter Shilton's head, while Pope Francis, right, is regarded as God's right-hand man

He said the plan could change: 'We'll see in the coming days.' 

While on the field, the match may be decided by Lionel Messi and Thomas Mueller, superstitious football fans believe a higher power may be crucial factor.

Pope Francis has so far refused to offer any special backing for his native Argentinian team who beat the Netherlands last night on penalties. 

Fr Lombardi said: 'Both would want the better team to win, without taking sides.'

Pope Francis met with his favouite team San Lorenzo last December after they won the Argentine league. 

Pope Francis wished all teams good luck at the start of the World Cup tournament which ends on Sunday 

Pope Francis, right, has no plans to invite his predecessor, Pope Benedict, left around for Sunday's game 

Argentinian fans believe that 'their' man in the Vatican will inspire the team to victory during Sunday's final 

The prospect of each team having their own Pope has captured the imagination of people on Twitter who have began speculating whether this is an advantage for either team. 

Germany had no problem progressing to the final having thrashed Brazil 7-1 in the biggest semi-final win in the history of the competition. 

Argentina, on the other hand, struggled against the Netherlands, relying on a penalty shoot-out.

However, divine inspiration may have helped the Argentinians as Holland's first penalty was driven straight at the keeper.  

Argentine fans celebrated wildly after their team progressed to the World Cup Final and hope Pope Francis will put in a good word so their team will beat Pope Benedict's Germany who beat hosts Brazil 7-1 on Tuesday night

German fans could not believe the margin of their victory over hosts Brazil on Tuesday night which saw them progress to Sunday's World Cup final against Argentina 

Argentine fans are convinced that Pope Francis is on their side and have even special papal masks - even though the Pontiff has repeatedly said that he will not be praying for his native Argentina during the tournament
