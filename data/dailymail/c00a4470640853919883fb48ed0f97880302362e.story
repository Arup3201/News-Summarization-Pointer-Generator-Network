Two boys who had gone out to build a snow fort were inadvertently trapped for four hours in a Newburgh, New York, snow bank when a plow operator clearing a parking lot pushed snow over them, not realizing they were there, officials said.

The boys – cousins Jason ‘J.J.’ Rivera, 9, Elijah ‘Papito’ Martinez, 11 - spent Thanksgiving in the hospital after the terrifying accident, which police said could have killed them.

Authorities said the boys' parents became alarmed when they didn't come home from playing around 10 p.m., and after a fruitless search called police around 11:50 p.m. on Wednesday.

The boys had been building a snow fort in an area of the nearby Family Health Center in Newburgh, New York

During their search that officers learned that the boys had been building a snow fort in the area of the nearby Family Health Center.

They boys had been digging the fort out of the snow bank, when the plow truck came through and trapped them, police said.

Officials finally found the boys around 2 a.m. on Thursday, after an officer saw a shovel half buried in the snow bank.

The officer took the shovel and started to dig, and saw a small boot. Others joined in, some digging with bare hands, and the boys were found.

A neighbor captured cell phone footage of the police and others frantically digging the boys out of the snow at 2 a.m. on Thursday morning

They were conscious and suffering from exposure.

Authorities said a snow plow operator had been clearing a parking lot by pushing snow over, and didn't see the boys on the other side of the pile.

The boys ended up buried to the point where they could not move their arms and legs.

'They were probably in about five feet of snow,' Newburgh police Sgt. Aaron Weaver told CBS New York. 'But however it fell, there was, like, a dome around their heads, so there was air in there, like space for them.'

Weaver, who was among the rescuers, said the dome of air was the only thing that saved them.

Both the victims were recovering on Thursday night at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla. Family members said they are in a good condition.

Newburgh is about 60 miles north of New York City and had received more than a half-foot of snow.
