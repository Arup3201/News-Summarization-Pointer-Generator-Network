Swansea are considering Franck Tabanou from St Etienne. The 25-year-old left-sided defender  is available for around £3.5million.

Tabanou, a former France Under-21 international Tabanou, can also play left midfield. 

St Etienne are currently fourth in the Ligue 1 table after their 1-0 home loss to Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday thanks to a 60th minute penalty from Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

His agent Philippe Lamboley said: 'The two clubs are in discussions, but I cannot confirm a bid has been made.'

Swansea are maintaining interest in Rubin Kazan midfielder Yann M'Vila also although a proposed loan was off at one stage over the weekend.

Garry Monk's side are ninth in the Premier League ahead of their clash with Southampton at St Mary's on Sunday.
