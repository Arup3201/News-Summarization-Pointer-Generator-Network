A Japanese electronics company has unveiled a 13ft super-robot which can be controlled by an iPhone.

But be careful with the jokes if you are on the phone to the pilot as the robot, made by Suidobashi Heavy 
Industry in Tokyo, brings a whole new meaning to ‘trigger-happy’.

'Kuratas' is fitted with a futuristic weapons system, including a gatling gun capable of shooting 6,000 BB bullets a minute, which fires when the pilot smiles.

Transformers assemble: The 13ft, four ton, super-robot is going on sale for £900,000 - but you have to pay extra for the cup holder

Kuratas, made by Suidobashi Heavy 
Industry, can be controlled either through the one-man cockpit or from 
the outside using any smartphone connected to the 3G network.

The robot, which is set will go on sale for £900,000, has around 30 hydraulic joints which the pilot moves using motion control.

As it is made to order the style conscious buyer will not have to worry about sticking to the grey exterior - it comes in 16 colours, including black and pink, and for an extra £60 they will sort you out with a cup holder.

Simple touch: All you need to remote control the robot is a 3G connection and works particularly well with iPhone's touchscreen

You can also use the MasterSlave control system where you move a tiny version of the Kuratas - with an iPhone strapped to its back - to get the life-sized one to follow your bidding

Engineers Wataru Yoshizaki and Kogoro Kurata were saluted in front of Kuratas together with their pilot Anna when they showcased the robot at the Wonder Festival in Chiba, suburban Tokyo earlier today.

The team have been working on the robot since 2010.

The company also released a video where very attractive Anna gives step by step instructions of how to operate the Kuratas.

Rush hour: If you have grown weary of a traditional commute Kuratas is fully functioning on the road - but will not get you to work any faster as its top speed barely hits 7 mph

The video reminds the viewer of the security instructions on an airplane with Anna taking on the role as futuristic airhostess.

If
 you are not the piloting kind of millionaire, Kuratas can be operated 
using what Suidobashi calls the ‘Master-Slave system’ where you control 
the robot’s movements from outside using any device with a 3G network 
such as an iPhone.

‘Automatic alignment allows you to 
lock on your enemy target. Kuratas will not allow any targets to escape.

'With the alignment set appropriately the system will fire BBs when the 
pilot smiles.’

Pilot Anna is set to enter the robot's cockpit and poses with the two men behind it: Wataru Yoshizaki, left and Kogoro Kurata after whom the robot has been named

Female 'pilot' Anna looks out the cockpit of Kuratas - with onlookers breathing a sigh of relief at the stern look on her face as the trigger for the heavy artillery is a smile

Realising 
that there may be a flaw with this system of opening fire, the video 
warns the pilot against smiling too much whilst operating 
the Kuratas weaponry.

Kurayas is 13ft tall and weighs four tons – not including the pilot.

The
 four wheeled legs ensures that it is easy to transport and the pilot 
will be able to drive it at a top speed of just under 6.5 mph.
