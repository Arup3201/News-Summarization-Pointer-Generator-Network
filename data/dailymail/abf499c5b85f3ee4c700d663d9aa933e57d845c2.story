The man police suspect of stabbing a 17-year-old schoolgirl  to death in a suburban park was caught on camera calmly boarding a bus less than 20 minutes after the cold-blooded attack.

Police have released two CCTV images of the man getting on a bus shortly after Masa Vukotic was murdered  just five minutes from her Doncaster home in Melbourne's east on Tuesday.

Masa, known affectionately by her friends as 'Marci', was stabbed in daylight while walking along a path at Koonung Creek Linear Reserve just before 7pm in what police believe was a 'random attack'.

Detectives say the man they are looking for boarded a bus on Doncaster Road near the park at about 7.09pm, before getting off near the intersection of Hoddle Street and Johnston Street at Abbotsford.

He was captured carrying what looked to be a white plastic bag, which may have carried the murder weapon. 

It comes as friends of the murdered Canterbury Girls Secondary College student paid tribute to their 'beautiful Princess Marci'.

Masa, known affectionately by her friends as 'Marci', was stabbed in daylight while walking along a path at Koonung Creek Linear Reserve just before 7pm 

'The world has certainly become a darker place without her,' a friend told Daily Mail Australia. 

On Wednesday night more than 100 mourners visited the crime scene, with her friends dressing in pink to lay flowers where her body was found.

'Marci was without a doubt one of the most wonderful people I've ever met,' a friend said.

'She was so full of personality and passion and her sense of humour was incredible.' 

'She inspired myself and so many others to love ourselves and be confident in who we are. She never missed a moment to remind her friends that she thought they were wonderful.' 

Friends spoke fondly of her love of the colour pink, her pet rabbit Roger, dressing up and Japanese fashion.

The man was spotted on CCTV cameras running from a suburban park in Melbourne where Masa was stabbed to death as she walked just five minutes from her home

Masa, who only just turned 17 in December, was one of three children from a Serbian family who had moved to Melbourne from Montenegro.

Her distressed relatives were pictured arriving at the park following news of her death.

Her body was found by police along a walking track when a neighbour called triple zero after hearing screams and saw a man fleeing the scene.

She was in cardiac arrest when she was found, but paramedics were unable to save her and she died at the scene.

Police say she was wearing headphones at the time and may not have heard the attacker approaching. 

Detectives are looking into whether Masa was randomly attacked or whether she was stalked.

They released CCTV footage of a man running from the crime scene carrying a plastic bag and arrested a man who matched that description on Wednesday afternoon.

But he was released after being questioned and is no longer a suspect. Police are now hunting for the man spotted getting onto the bus on Wednesday.  

It comes as friends of the murdered 17-year-old Canterbury Girls Secondary College student paid tribute to their 'beautiful Princess Marci' 

The teenager was a a Canterbury Girls Secondary College VCE student who was known by friends as Marci

Masa, who only just turned 17 in December, was described as a bright girl who knew three languages and was focussed on her dream of becoming a lawyer 

'If anyone knows him, they'll know him from the footage,' Homicide Detective Inspector Michael Hughes said.

'Several people have spoken to us and we've certainly been able to put together the track (he took).'

'It's terrible that a 17-year-old child can't go walking in a park. It is an absolute tragedy that this child's life has been taken.

'Here we have a the death of a young woman going about her business.

'We should be able to feel safe in the community... and we will throw all our resources to behind this ensure the offender is caught.' 

Police arrested a man on Wednesday just metres from the crime scene. He matched the description of the suspect, but released after questioning

Homicide Detective Inspector Michael Hughes said he was confident someone would recognise the suspect who was caught on camera running from the crime scene 

Masa has been described as a bright girl who knew three languages and was focussed on her dream of becoming a lawyer. 

'It's such a shame she'll never reach those dreams now,' a friend said.

'She never let anything or anyone stand in her way. She was passionate and driven and I love her very much.'

Her friends are organising a memorial picnic at Queen Victoria Gardens in Melbourne on March 28 to be called 'Princess Marci's Royal Picnic'. 

They are asking people to wear pink or 'Lolita Japapese fashion' as an ode to Masa's style, or something 'rabbit-related' as she was so fond of her pet rabbit, Roger.
