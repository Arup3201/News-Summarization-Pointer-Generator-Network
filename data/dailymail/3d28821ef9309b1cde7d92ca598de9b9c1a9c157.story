Authorities say a suburban Chicago teen confessed to stabbing her 11-year-old sister to death Tuesday morning because she is 'not thankful.'

Dora Betancourt had as many as 40 stab wounds across her neck, chest and arms, as well as slashes to her face. Her 14-year-old sister reportedly shouted a separate reason at her for each stab wound.

The teenage suspect initially claimed a Hispanic male had broken into their Mundelein, Illinois, home, but she allegedly confessed after police revealed they had found a strand of the killer's hair in the victim's hand.

Brutally murdered: Authorities say Dora Betancourt's older sister confessed to her savage murder

Authorities told local media the older sister waited while young Dora slept before taking a kitchen knife and committing the grisly murder.

The unidentified older sister stabbed and slashed the young girl in a frenzied attack, shouting a reason at her sister each time she plunged the knife into her body, police said.

Stab wounds were found in the girl's neck, arms and torso, some of them defensive wounds. The Lake County Medical Examiner's Office told CBS Chicago 'the young girl's body had so many wounds they couldn't count them all... [and] were so deep they punctured her lung.'

'A struggle ensued,' Assistant State's Attorney Claudia Kasten told the courtroom, according to CBS Chicago. 'She kept stabbing.'

The teen kept stabbing and slashing until Dora's body fell lifelessly off the bed and then called her mother claiming she had been woken by her 
sister's screams, authorities said.

A 911 call had her claiming a 
Hispanic male killed the young girl. The 14-year-old tried washing 
Dora's blood off in the bathroom but still had some on her when police 
arrived, they said.

Cops said they discovered the girl's lifeless body in her room with the knife used in the attack still on the bed.

The teenager continued to claim an intruder committed the crime until investigators told her they had recovered a strand of her hair on the victim's body, she then confessed to the crime, according to police.

'What could be so bad that she did something like that?' Neighbor Verona DeCosta told NBC Chicago. 'A 14-year-old doing that... that sounds demonic to me.'

The
 girls' mother wept during a Wednesday court hearing where prosecutors 
claimed that the older girl had set her alarm early and made her attack 
while her little sister was still in bed.

'With each stab wound, she said she was not thankful for what she had done,' Ms Kasten said, according to NBC Chicago.

The older girl told investigators she made dinner six times that week and that her sister made her mad after hitting her the night before, the Chicago Sun Times reported.

Their mother was not home at the time of the attack, which happened just before 8:30 a.m.

The girl wore gray prison scrubs, sat stone-faced during the hearing and left quickly when it was over, as her mother sat at the same table, but without looking at her, the Chicago Tribune reported.

The sisters shared the same mother but have a different father.

Neither the mother nor the daughter took their eyes off the judge for the duration of the hearing.

'There was evidence of trauma, and while multiple stab wounds were evident, I will defer to the coroner's office,' Mundelein police chief Eric Guenther told NBC Chicago.

He added that officers had been called to the home before, 'but nothing pertains to an incident like this.'

Authorities are currently mulling whether to charge the teen as an adult, reports said.

Unexpected: Neighbors were shocked to hear of the attack, one called the accused murderer 'demonic'

Locals were shocked by the horrifying crime.

'They would always be together,' Mary Anne Gryder told WLS. 'The older one would be taking care of the younger one, and vice versa.'

One neighbor told the Tribune he often saw the accused killer helping her younger sister do cartwheels.

'It's a little disheartening, you wonder why it happened,' another told CBS Chicago.

The family were members of the St John Lutheran Church and the victim attended the St John Lutheran school in Libertyville, where grief counselors were on hand Wednesday to help her friends.

The accused killer's next court hearing is scheduled for January 31.
