The woman who sparked a heated internet discussion after revealing her 'after' weight loss picture was rejected by Shape magazine is set to be featured after all.

Brooke Birmingham, 28, from Quad Cities, Illinois, appeared on the Today show this morning with Shape editor-at-large Bahar Takhtehchian, who asserted that the entire incident was a 'misunderstanding' involving a freelance writer unfamiliar with the magazine's editorial policies.

The pair revealed that not only will Brooke be featured in an upcoming issue - including the bikini picture in question - but she'll also join four other women in talking about the true realities of weight loss, and the effects it has on a woman's body.

Success story: Brooke Birmingham, who sparked a heated internet discussion after revealing her 'after' weight loss picture was rejected by Shape magazine, is set to be featured after all

Sending the right message: The feature will include the bikini picture that started the controversy after it was apparently rejected because of how Brooke's stomach looked

'We're here to say that we are celebrating people like Brooke,' explained Ms Takhtehchian.

'We are excited to make this into an impactful discussion about weight loss and the realities. We want to turn this into something positive so it makes a big impact.'

And despite being initially offended by the magazine's rejection, Brooke said the miscommunication has been resolved and she is equally excited to be part of this important discussion.

'It was my intention to start a 
conversation,' she said of her photo submission and subsequent blog post about the incident.

'We want to start a discussion because
 truly, there is a journey after the weight-loss journey'

'I had no idea that it would come to this! It was important
 to me because that is my body and I felt like I needed to put it out 
there to show people what a real weight loss looks like.'

Shape initially approached Brooke about featuring her after her blog came to their attention, but the 'after' photo she sent in was rejected because of the way her stomach looked.

The writer handling her story sent her a message that read: 'My editors were hoping you could send over a different after photo... They are looking to include one with a shirt.'  

Perfect solution: 'We are excited to make this into an impactful discussion about weight loss and the realities. We want to turn this into something positive,' said Shape editor-at-large  Bahar Takhtehchian (right)

'Miscommunication': Ms Takhtehchian said the writer who asked Brooke for a picture with a T-shirt instead was a freelancer who 'unfortunately said there was an editorial policy that simply doesn't exist'

'I was hurt,' Brooke said on Today. 'I mean, I felt like my body wasn't good enough to be on their website when you log on and do see women in bikinis.'

So she rebutted by refusing to be in the article at all, and by posting a blog entry that went viral.

'My body is real, not Photoshopped or hidden because I feel like I should be ashamed,' she wrote in her post.

'This is a body after losing 172lbs, a body that has done amazing things, and looks AMAZING in a freaking bikini. This is the type of body they should have featured because it can give people hope.'

Ms Takhtehchian said she is excited to give Brooke - and other woman with the same weight loss experience - a voice.

Before and after: Brooke responded to Shape's initial rejection with a blog post that went viral. 'This is a body after losing 172lbs, a body that has done amazing things, and looks AMAZING in a freaking bikini,' she wrote

New woman: In the upcoming Shape issue, Brooke will join four other women in revealing the true realities of weight loss, and the effects it has on a woman's body

'We want to start a larger discussion 
about what happens after you lose a significant amount of weight because,
 truly, there is a journey after the weight-loss journey,' she said.

It has not yet been revealed exactly when the issue featuring Brooke will be published.

'That is my body and I felt like I needed to put it out there to show people what real weight loss looks like'

In Shape's original response to the outrage caused by Brooke's claims, the magazine insisted it was a miscommunication.

'This is a result of a misunderstanding with a freelance writer,' a spokesperson said.

'This does not represent Shape's editorial values and the comments made about Shape's "editorial policy" are absolutely untrue.

'Shape
 prides itself on empowering and celebrating women like Brooke, and any 
indication that we would not run the piece with the photo provided was 
wrong, as we would have been proud to share her inspirational story.​'
