Australia's Hockeyroos have won a titanic battle with old-rivals England in the Gold medal match at the Commonwealth Games.

The unbeaten women's hockey side went in as favourites against England, but needed to score a last-minute equaliser to send the match into a penalty shootout.

Goalkeeper Rachael Lynch was the saving grace for Australia, deflecting three of England’s four penalties to give the Australians their back-to-back Commonwealth Games gold.

The Australians left it until 16 seconds from fulltime before equalising at 1-1, when defender Jodie Kenny scored her tenth and most important goal of the tournament.

It was then left to Lynch to defy the English raid on goal in the shootout, before captain Madonna Blyth coolly slotted home her penalty to claim the gold medal.

A frustrated Hockeyroos earlier struggled to get their combinations working on a rain-soaked pitch which kept the match to a scoreless first half.

Despite having more of the ball, and five extra shots on goal, the Australians could not break the deadlock and it was left to England 13 minutes after the break to score through Lily Owsley.

The teenager lofted over the head of Lynch and into the back of the net, and it t wasn't until two minutes from time when the Australians earned their first penalty corner that they struck.

From the resulting play, Anna Flanagan’s first shot was saved but the rebound fell to Jodie Kenny who flicked the ball on to equalise with just 16 seconds remaining.

The 3-1 penalty shootout means Australia’s women's team have now won four of the five gold medals on offer, with our men having won all four ahead of tomorrow’s final.

In other day 10 results, Australian Alana Boyd showed her class in the Pole Vault with a first-up success of 4.35m and then a gold winning clearance of 4.40m.

Australia's only other gold medal came in the pool with diver Esther Qin producing a stunning upset to claim gold in the women’s 3m springboard final.

The results come after a solid day nine in which Australian sprinter Sally Pearson yesterday shrugged off the weight of a tumultuous week at the Commonwealth Games by winning back-to-back gold in her pet track event the 100m hurdles.

Pearson won gold in 12.67s - quicker again than her semi final win - to defeat rival Tiffany Porter who ran 12.80, with Canada's Angela Whyte bronze in 13.02 on a day where Australia hauled in four gold.

A jubilant Pearson, who had stayed silent on the sacking of coach Eric Hollingswoth earlier in the week, made a statement louder than any words could when she flew home in the final before celebrating with fans post-race.

The 27-year-old capped off not only a personal milestone but a big day for Australians generally with four athletes bagging golds on day nine.

Rookie high jumper Eleanor Patterson, discus thrower Dani Samuels and diver Matthew Mitcham also made their statements on the world stage.
