The police force responsible for controlling the Ferguson riots has spent more than $170,000 replenishing stocks of riot control equipment ahead of an expected revival of disorder.

Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson in a confrontation on August 9 that sparked months-long protests across Ferguson, Missouri.

The police's recent spending is aimed at avoiding a renewed outbreak of violence during the potentially large demonstrations that could follow an announcement of whether the Officer Wilson will face a criminal trial for the August 9 death of Brown.

The police force's response to the disorder triggered concerns about the militarization of police

As well as accusations local police were racially profiling black members of the community, concerns were raised about the force's military-style response to the disorder.

It has now been revealed that since August, when the protests first began, St Louis County police have spent $172,669 on crowd control equipment, the Guardian reported.

This included spending on 650 teargas grenades, 1,500 beanbag rounds and 6,000 pepper balls. 

Further spending was also made on 235 riot gear helmets, 135 shields, 25 batons and 60 sets of shin guards.

Meanwhile, the future of the chief of police in Ferguson remains unclear amid reports he will step down from this position as soon as next week.

Police chief Thomas Jackson is expected to announce plans to leave his post as part of an effort to overhaul the city's police department, CNN is reporting, citing 'government officials'.

The move is said to be part of an attempt to show the people of Ferguson the department is taking action regardless of the result of Officer Wilson's grand jury trial.

It could also be a way of offering the community a 'sacrificial lamb' in the case of the grand jury deciding not to indict him on criminal charges.

CNN is reporting that the announcement could come next week.

'Stepping down': Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson will step down from his position next week as part of an effort to overhaul the city's police department, according to reports

Jackson has faced a major backlash over the way his department handled the shooting of Michael Brown in August

'The animosity that existed in Ferguson were way before Mike Brown's shooting, justified or not. So, unfortunately, the leadership in the police department has to change,' said CNN legal analyst Mark O' Mara.

'And if he's sort of a sacrificial lamb to get this started, it's going to have to be. Ferguson's going to have to more forward. And it doesn't seem they can move forward with this police chief in place.'

As part of the plan the St. Louis County police chief will step in as the interim chief for Ferguson.

However the reports are being shot down by Jackson and the local press. 

'It’s absolutely not true. Nobody has asked me to resign nor have I been fired,' Jackson told the St. Louis Post Dispatch.

Similarly, in a sit-down interview with CNN late last month, Jackson apologized for the way his department handled the Brown incident and its aftermath, with police clashing with protesters.

However he maintained he would not be stepping down.

'I've talked to a lot of people who have initially called for that and then changed their mind after having meetings and discussions about moving forward,' Jackson said on September 29.

'Realistically, I'm going to stay here and see this through.

'This is mine, and I'm taking ownership of it.'

Police and protesters have repeatedly clashed since the shooting, which prompted a national conversation about race and police tactics.

Grand jury proceedings are secret, but legal analysts say recently leaked information about Wilson's testimony to investigators may be an attempt to prepare the public for the possibility that he might not be charged.

The decision could be made public within the next month.

In the meantime, law officers have adjusted their tactics for interacting more peacefully with protesters while also honing their procedures for quick, widespread arrests.

They plan to have a large contingent of officers at the ready, but have been meeting with clergy, community leaders and students in hopes of building relationships that could ease tensions on the streets.  

Law enforcement officers expect to receive at least a day's notice before a grand jury announcement.

That should provide time for them to execute security plans but may also allow demonstrators to prepare.
