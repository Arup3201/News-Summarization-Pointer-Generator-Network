An Atlantic City casino is cursing its bad luck, and a careless security driver, after it lost a bag of cash worth $21,000.

The incident took place during a routine pickup from Revel Casino when the armoured vehicle driver left the cash on the roof of his car and drove off.

It is the second bit of bad news in less than a week for the $2.4billion resort, after they announced they are having to close their doors due to money problems.

The Revel Casino Hotel in Atlantic City has fallen victim to a careless security card.

Security footage shows the bag being placed on the roof of the car by the driver before he drives off onto his next pickup.

Unbelievably it is still on the roof when the car pulls up at Resorts Atlantic City, which is about six minutes drive away from Revels, reports Press of Atlantic City.

The driver then gets back in his truck and pulls off, yet again failing to notice the cash on his roof.

It is unclear where or when the money fell off after that.

The Revel Casino has said that responsibility for the loss lies with GardaWorld. (stock photo)

GardaWorld, the armoured vehicle company involved, have opened an investigation.

'We are cooperating with the authorities in investigating this incident and cannot provide any additional details,' said Joe Gavaghan, director of corporate communications.

While losing $21,000 would be staggering for most gamblers, it's not a lot compared to Revel's other losses.

The casino, completed just two years ago for $2.4 billion, has failed to generate enough business to stay open and filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in June.

It loses about $2 million a week, according to bankruptcy documents.

It is not the first time an armoured car has lost the money it is supposed to be transporting.

In May, a California man who was working in a parking lot as part of a drug rehabilitation program returned $125,000 that had fallen from one of the vehicles.

In 1981, a Philadelphia man found $1.2 million that had fallen from an armored car.

Joey Coyle, the unemployed man who found the cash, went on a spending spree, giving cash to friends and strangers alike.

He was later acquitted of theft charges for reasons of temporary insanity.
