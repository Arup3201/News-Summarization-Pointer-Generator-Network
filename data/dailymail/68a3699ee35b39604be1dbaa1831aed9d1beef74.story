The rookie Cleveland police officer who fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice in a park had a poor job performance record and was forced out of a suburban police department after just a few months on the job, it was revealed today.

Surveillance video released by police showed Tamir being shot by Officer Tim Loehmann within 2 seconds of a patrol car stopping near him at a park on November 22. 

It shows the boy reaching in his waistband for what police discovered was an airsoft gun, which shoots non-lethal plastic projectiles. He died the next day.

Bad cop: Rookie officer Tim Loehmann, pictured left, quit the Independence Police Department in December 2012 after just six months on the job. His superiors described him as lacking in maturity, weepy and distracted

In the blink of an eye: It took Officer Loehmann 2 seconds to shoot Rice after mistaking his BB gun for a real firearm 

Police said Officer Loehmann believed the boy had a real firearm.

Loehmann joined Cleveland police in March after spending six months in 2012 with the police department in Independence, Ohio - a community of about 7,100 located 12 miles southeast of Cleveland.

Personnel files released Wednesday showed police supervisors in Independence decided he lacked the maturity needed to work in their department. A letter in his file said there was a pattern of a lack of indiscretion and of not following instructions.

'In law enforcement there are times when instructions need be followed to the letter, and I am under the impression Ptl. Loehmann, under certain circumstances, will not react in the way instructed,' the letter said.

Loehmann's superiors within the department described the rookie cop as being 'weepy' and 'distracted' during firearms qualification training, reported Cleveland.com. 

'He could not follow simple directions, could not communicate clear thoughts nor recollections, and his handgun performance was dismal,' according to the letter written by Deputy Chief Jim Polak.

Polak concluded Loehmann's evaluation by stating that in his opinion, neither time nor training 'will be able to change or correct' the officer's professional deficiencies.

Pointed remark: During a memorial service for Tamir Rice Wednesday, the boy's uncle told mourners that police need to revamp how they train officers

Loehmann resigned from the Independence Police Department in December 2012 after meeting his supervisors about their concerns. He was hired by the Cleveland Police Department in March 2013. 

The officer's father has said in a recent interview that his son quit the force in suburban Independence and joined the big-city department because he wanted 'more action.'

It remains unknown if Cleveland police supervisors read Loehmann's personnel file from Independence before hiring him.

Tim Loehmann's records indicate that the young officer's troubled relationship with his girlfriend adversely impacted his job performance during his six-month tenure at the suburban police department.

According to a report written by one of his supervisors, Loehmann once fell asleep during training and was often seen weeping.

On another occasion, he left his firearm in an unsecured locker, according to 19 Action News.

In November 2012, Loehmann took off from the police dispatch center without permission and then lied about it to a supervisor. 

Loehmann told his superiors that he wanted to quit, move to New York City and join the NYPD where his father served for 20 years.

The department was in the process of firing him when Loehmann quit of his own accord.

Several hundred people attended the memorial for Tamir at Mount Sinai Baptist Church Wednesday

Despite all his apparent shortcomings, perceived lack of maturity and inability to follow directions, his files said he was 'eligible for rehire.' 

During a memorial service for Tamir Rice Wednesday, the boy's uncle told mourners that police need to revamp how they train officers while also looking closer at police brutality and the use of excessive force. 

A grand jury will consider whether to charge Tim Loehmann in connection to Rice's shooting.

Just days after the tragedy, protesters marched past City Hall and temporarily blocked rush-hour traffic on a busy Cleveland freeway.

Several hundred people attended the memorial for Tamir at Mount Sinai Baptist Church earlier today.

Family members and friends, some wearing shirts with Tamir's picture, filed past displays of photos at the front of the church and stopped to hug his mother.

One of his former teachers said Tamir liked to draw, play basketball and the drums.
