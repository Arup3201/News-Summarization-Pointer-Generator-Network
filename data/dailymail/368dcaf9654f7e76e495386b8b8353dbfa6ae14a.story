'Digital surgery' also used to replace wrinkles on stars who have
Botox

First it was the airbrushed models, doctored to appear impossibly thin.

Now Hollywood moguls have been criticised for stretching actresses to make them longer and leaner.

Last night, body image campaigners said it was another example of young girls being encouraged to seek perfection that doesn’t exist.

Hollywood film makers are apparently using a post production technique to stretch actresses, making them taller and slimmer. The new enhancement fad has been revealed after singer Britney Spears appeared in a documentary about her Las Vegas show, looking remarkably taller and slimmer

‘Digital surgery’ as it has been 
labelled, is already used to add lines on the faces of stars who have 
had Botox, with Martin Scorsese complaining that the injections leave 
them unable to show emotion.

It
 is thought Wolf of Wall Street star Margot Robbie may be among those 
doctored, after fans noticed the 5ft 6in actress looked unusually leggy 
in the film. Miss Robbie recently criticised the Hollywood pressure for 
women to be ‘gorgeous and thin’.

The
 practice first came to light in a Britney Spears documentary, when the 
5ft 4in singer gained three inches to meet the ‘showgirl minimum’ for 
her Las Vegas concerts. She also appeared thinner in the documentary 
than in a promotional clip for it.

How Kim Kardashian may look if she was subject to the digital surgery. Post production sources at a studio which uses the technique, compared it to a 'fun house mirror'

How Mariah Carey might appear of she was digitally stretched to make her appear taller. The technique is being branded 'digital surgery' and is also being employed to replace lines and wrinkles on the faces of stars who have had Botox

Pippa
 Smith, of pressure group Safermedia, said: ‘These films are role models
 to young girls and as such should have a responsibility towards society
 rather than cynical commercialism – in fact I can see no reason why it 
is necessary to change women’s natural beauty in such ways. It’s hideous
 and wrong.’

Mrs Smith 
said it could lead to women going for painful surgery to make their legs
 longer. ‘I actually knew a young Chinese woman, highly educated, who 
had her legs lengthened – a very extreme thing to do,’ she said.

Kate Hardcastle from the Positive Image campaign accused film producers of promoting unhealthy ideas about beauty.

Film
 producer Gavin Polone said it was typical of female film executives to 
have actresses digitally altered but he had never heard of a male 
executive doing so. He told the Sunday Times: ‘On many occasions I’ve 
heard female producers ask to have an actress digitally stretched.

‘I am not going to say which actresses are stretched – and it’s always about women, which is unfair – but it is very common.’

Australian bloggers suggested actress Margot Robbie appeared 'impossibly long-legged' in one of the main scenes in The Wolf of Wall Street
