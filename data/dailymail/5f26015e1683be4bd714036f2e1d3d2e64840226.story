Authorities have told the parents of the two Chinese schoolgirls killed in the Asiana Airlines crash which of their daughters was the one possibly struck and killed by a fire truck on the runway.

The parents of 16-year-old Ye Mengyuan, a talented gymnast, were told by investigators on Tuesday that she was the victim potentially hit by the vehicle, the San Mateo County coroner said.

Ye's parents flew to San Francisco International Airport late on Monday night along with the parents of 16-year-old Wang Lin Jia, a close friend of Ye's who was also killed in the crash.

Authorities revealed earlier this week that, amid the chaos, it is possible that an emergency responder vehicle hit and killed one of teenagers. Her body was found by an escape slide.

The medical examiner is conducting an autopsy to determine whether she was dead before she was struck, and the investigation has been handed over the to the police department's hit-and-run unit.

In the chaos of the crash-landing of 
Asiana Airlines Flight 214 on Saturday morning, dozens of police cars, 
fire trucks and ambulances rushed to the scene to help recuse the 
jetliner's passengers.

The possibility that the girl was hit by a truck was first suggested by a firefighter to a superior on Saturday.

The
firefighter said that a passenger on the ground roughly 30 feet from 
the wreckage and near the escape slide may have been run over as fire 
crews were shifting from dousing the flames to taking victims to 
hospitals, officials said.

Police,
FBI agents, the coroner and other officials were notified after the 
firefighter reported his concerns and the drivers of the first five 
trucks were given drug and alcohol tests, which they passed.

It
is not clear why the firefighters thought someone had been run over and
Fire Department officials said they did not want to provide details 
because of the ongoing investigation.

Findings of what caused the 16-year-oldâ€™s death - the plane crash, the fire truck, or both - might not come for several weeks.

'One
of the deceased did have injuries consistent with those of having been 
run over by a vehicle,' fire department spokeswomen Mindy Talmadge said.
'Many agencies were on the field.'

'One
of our fire apparatus may have come into contact with one of our two 
victims,' Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White added during a press conference.
'I assure you, we are looking closely at this.'

Airport video surveillance footage 
reviewed by federal accident investigators was unable to help with 
reaching a conclusion, NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said.

Probe: San Francisco Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White said they are taking the reports very seriously and the matter has been handed over to the police. All firetruck drivers passed alcohol tests that day

'It is a very serious issue and we want to understand it,' she said. 'We want to make sure we have all the facts before we reach conclusions.'

San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault said on Monday that the two girls were identified through fingerprints and their bodies had been prepared to be collected by their parents.

Asiana Airlines said Ye and Wang, both from Jiangshan in eastern China, were headed for a summer camp in the U.S. - part of a group of 70 Chinese students and teachers aboard the Boeing 777.

They were to visit Silicon Valley, 
Stanford University and University of California's campuses in Los 
Angeles and Berkeley as part of an English-language program, according 
to the Youth Times.

Ye was a top student who excelled 
in literature and was talented with the piano and singing. She also loved gymnastics and had recently won a national gymnastics 
competition.

She also routinely received honors at the school's annual speech 
contests.

Remembered: A vigil was held for Wang and Ye, who were traveling to the U.S. for a summer camp

Wang was class representative for three 
years and teachers and schoolmates described her as excelling in physics
and being good at calligraphy and drawing, according to the paper.

The two girls had been inseparable for the four years since they met at middle school. They often ate lunch together and both enjoyed school, CNN reported.

The cause of the crash remains under investigation, but the NTSB has said that the plane was going slower than a safe landing speed.

At the last minute, it accelerated but the rear end of the aircraft hit the sea wall and the tail was severed, sending the plane spinning down the runway before coming to a stop and catching fire.

The two girls lost their lives and 182 other passengers were taken to hospital. Miraculously, 123 of the people on board walked away physically unscathed.
