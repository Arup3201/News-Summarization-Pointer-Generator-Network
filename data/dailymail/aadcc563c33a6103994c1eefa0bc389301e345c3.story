A man is fighting for his life after crashing his Audi TT into a house in the early hours of this morning.

The male driver, believed to be in his twenties, embedded the red sports car into the side of the house in Lowestoft, Suffolk, at 1.45am after coming off the road and crashing through a fence.

He was taken to the James Paget Hospital with serious head injuries but was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, where he was in a 'critical condition', said Suffolk Police today.

The car came off the road and through a fence before hitting the house in Lowestoft, Suffolk

Three people inside the house, including the homeowners, were asleep at the time of the accident but were unharmed, besides shock.

They are said to be staying with friends while structural engineers inspected the house.

Keith Shales, 66, who lives in nearby Cotmer Road, told the BBC: 'When I got there and saw the car through the hole in the hedge I thought that looks serious.

'I've seen photos of cars going into people's houses before but from the pavement, through the bushes and the cars behind it - it was like a launch pad - it must have been for him to get that high.

'I reckon he must be about four feet off the ground, I've never seen anything like it.'

The driver also clipped an Audi estate car and BMW estate parked near the house on Long Meadow Walk. A bystander said the Audi estate had a baby seat in the front.

Today structural engineers inspected the house as the Audi TT was removed from the side

Suffolk Fire Brigade wrote on their Facebook page: 'Crews from Lowestoft South were called to a RTC involving one car that had gone into a house.

'Crews were in attendance at 01:52 and found 1 person trapped with a possible gas leak from the house.

'The incident was under control at 02:46 and 1 casualty was released into the care of the ambulance service. Crews remain on scene making safe.'

Suffolk Police today appealed for any witness to the crash to come forward.
