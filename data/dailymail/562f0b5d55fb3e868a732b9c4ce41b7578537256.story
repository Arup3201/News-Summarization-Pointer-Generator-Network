A former Wickes cashier who became governor of an oil-rich Nigerian state has been jailed jailed for his part in a scam which plundered £157million from some of the poorest people in the world.

James Ibori was sentenced to 13 years in prison after he pocketed £50million which he splashed on a life of luxury including his own private jet.

But the £50million figure may prove to be 'ludicrously low', said Judge Anthony Pitts as he sentenced Ibori for a series of offences including fraud and money-laundering.

'In the light of other matters, perhaps that is a ludicrously low figure and the figure may be in excess of £200 million, it is difficult to tell,' he told Southwark Crown Court in London.

'The confiscation proceedings may shed some further light on the enormity of the sums involved.'

Ibori, 49, an ex-governor of Delta 
State with presidential aspirations, stole public funds for a 'lavish 
and expensive lifestyle'.

His spending included a portfolio of 
luxury houses, a £12.6million private jet, a fleet of top-of-the-range 
cars, top UK boarding school places for his children, first-class travel
 and posh hotels.

As his people struggled in poverty, Ibori’s monthly credit card bills alone topped £125,000.

It is estimated that the embezzlement 
from the Delta state is yet unquantified, but could exceed £157million 
which was laundered in London through a number of off-shore companies.

The case at Southwark Crown Court was 
delayed this morning after a ruckus broke out in the corridor and police
 had to be called in to control crowds of his supporters.

Prosecutor Sasha Wass was thrown to the floor as supporters tried to rush into the tiny courtroom.

She told the hearing: 'The defendant 
was governor of the Delta State, one of the richest oil producing states
 in Nigeria, between November 1999 and May 2007.

'It is the prosecution case that 
during his two terms in office he deliberately and systematically 
defrauded the people whose interests he had been elected to represent he
 went on to launder the money he stole in this country.'

He inflated state contracts, took 
kickbacks, and through bent employees stole cash straight from the State
 accounts and secreted the cash into off-shore accounts across the 
globe.

Instead of using the money to help his
 people, he bought a £2.2 mansion in Hampstead with cash, a house in 
Regents Park, a flat in St John's Wood, a £311,000 home in Dorset and a 
£3.2million mansion in Johannesburg, as well as a house in Houston.

His 'greed and acquisitiveness' was 
also represented by his fleet of armoured Range Rovers worth £600,000, a
 £120,000 Bentley, a Jaguar for his Hampstead home and a Mercedes 
Maybach bought for 407,000 Euros that was shipped direct to his mansion 
in South Africa, Ms Wass said.

At an earlier hearing, Ibori pleaded 
guilty to ten offences - eight of money laundering, one of conspiracy to
 defraud Delta State and one of conspiracy to forge.

Nigerian-born Ibori moved to the UK in
 the 1980s where he married his wife, Theresa, and worked as a cashier 
at Wickes in Ruislip, Middlesex, earning around £15,000 a year before 
the couple were arrested for theft from the store in 1990 and fined 
£300.

A year later, he had another brush 
with the law when he was convicted of handling a stolen credit card and 
fined £100 before he moved back to his homeland and started as a ‘policy
 consultant’ for President Sani Abacha’s regime before climbing the 
ladder of the ruling People’s Democratic Party.

After lying to the independent 
Nigerian Election Commission by using a fake date of birth gained 
through a false passport to hide his previous convictions and financial 
status, Ibori was elected as state governor for Delta State from 1999 - 
giving him immunity from prosecution for his two terms until 2007.

Ms Wass described it as 'planned 
fraud'. She said: 'He didn’t accidentally become involved in a 
pre-existing corruption, he changed his date of birth in 1996.

'From the moment he was elected, he set out enriching himself at the expense of some of the poorest people in the world.

'His greed increased exponentially during the course of his governorship as did his arrogance.'

It was heard that he tried to pay a $15m bribe to a government official to make the corruption investigation 'go away'.

Even after he began to be investigated
 in 2005, Ibori involved himself in another 'massive fraud' and tried to
 bribe Nigerian officials, interfere with the trial and impugn the 
integrity of the officers.

He was helped by family members, 
including his wife, sister Christine Ibori-Ibie, his mistress Udoamaka 
Oniugbo, and a series of corrupt professionals - a London-based lawyer, 
Bhadresh Gohil, who acted as his banker and set up a myriad of off-shore
 companies, a fiduciary agent, Daniel Benedict McCann, a corporate 
financier, Lambertus De Boer - who have all been jailed for a total of 
30 years.

His fraud unravelled when the Met 
raided the office of 'trusted servant' Gohil, 47, who has since been 
jailed for 10 years, and found hard drives containing detailed records 
hidden in the wall behind a fire place.

A series of trials have taken place 
leading to six convictions and sentences totalling 30 years but Ibori 
has made a number of attempts to disrupt the course of justice, Ms Wass 
said.

When he was arrested in Nigeria in 
2007, the High Court froze assets worth £35million despite him only 
earning around £4,000 a year. A court later dismissed the charges and he
 fled to Dubai where he was arrested by the Met.

He was trying to purchase a $20million jet when he was arrested.

Ibori, wearing a dark suit and 
glasses, is represented by two QCs during his sentencing hearing which 
is expected to last two days.

The case continues.
