She'll soon be checking into a lock-down rehab facility, but Lindsay Lohan is certainly making the most of her freedom.

The 26-year-old was spotted in Venice, California on Friday with two male companions, including her rumoured new boyfriend Avi Snow.

The Mean Girls star was casually dressed in jeans, a grey vest and no bra, with her matted hair hanging loose.

She stopped in at the Gotta Have It vintage store where she bought some clothes.

Of course, Venice was Lindsay's old stomping ground before she moved to the East Coast.

It's the first time Lindsay has been pictured with Avi, who is a rocker with City of the Sun.

Friends hope he will be a good 
influence on the troubled starlet, with one saying: 'Avi's not a 
feckless party animal, he works in that industry, sure, but he's got a 
good head on his shoulders.

“He's from a solid background and doesn't get involved with the drugs 
scene, he doesn't even drink much... basically, he knows who is and 
likes control, he could help Lindsay.'

Lindsay will undergo her sixth 
attempt at getting sober when she begins her court ordered stint in 
rehab and her treatment will focus on her 'large' alcohol consumption 
and reliance on legal medications but the actress reportedly doesn't 
think she has a problem.

Rehab is part of a plea deal agreed this week in Los Angeles Superior Court relating to charges over a July car accident. She must begin treatment before May 2.

Meanwhile it also emerged she will not face charges despite being arrested over a New York City nightclub brawl with another woman.

Law enforcement sources told TMZ the Manhattan district attorney's office will not prosecute Lohan because witnesses failed to cooperate.

She was arrested in November for allegedly punching the woman inside Club Avenue.

However witnesses to the incident, including those connected with the alleged victim, refused to speak to investigators.

It is claimed another problem with the case is the woman she allegedly hit tripped and fell while being escorted out of the club by police, so it was unclear what really caused her injuries.

In the meantime, Lindsay is reportedly going to spend a week with Charlie during which she will tape a guest appearance on his FX show Anger Management, according to Perezhilton.

'Lindsay's pre-rehab plan? A week with Charlie Sheen in LA, then she wants to go to Brazil. I kid you not,' a source told the website.  

Lindsay and Charlie, 47, got to know each other when they filmed the upcoming comedy Scary Move 5, which is due to hit theatres on April 15.
