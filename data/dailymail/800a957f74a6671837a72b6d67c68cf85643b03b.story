Mark Hughes has accused Steve Bruce of trying to ‘defend the indefensible’ over Maynor Figueroa’s tackle on Stephen Ireland that left the Stoke City midfielder with a deep gash in his calf.

The Hull City manager responded to Hughes’ anger at the incident by insisting Ireland should already have been sent off following ‘the worst challenge on the pitch’ on David Meyler at the Britannia Stadium.

A picture of Ireland’s bloody leg was revealed in the aftermath of the match but Bruce said: ‘I could show you a picture of Figueroa's ankle, he had five stitches in it and carried on.’

The challenge left a  wound on Ireland's leg that Stoke boss Mark Hughes said  needed 12 to 15 stitches

That has angered Hughes, his former Manchester United team-mate.

‘Steve has fallen into the trap of trying to defend the indefensible,’ said Hughes. ‘Everyone has seen the two challenges and I don't think there is any sort of comparison whatsoever.

‘The outcome is there for everyone to see so I don't think Steve did himself too much credit with his observation.

‘It's fairly easily to defend things - and I do it too - but on this occasion it was not as if the lad would be suspended. So why did Steve not just say, “It was a terrible tackle”?

'We're trying to move on but Steve did not need to do that. He did not need to say that. To defend that is incorrect.’

Hull boss Bruce queried why Stephen Ireland was on the pitch after his challenge on David Meyler

Hughes added: ‘It looks likely Stephen is unavailable for two to three weeks.

‘Most people now have seen the picture and he’s had internal stitches as well as external, so it takes a little bit longer than a straightforward gash.

‘I’m disappointed as he was doing really well, filling the gap for Bojan.’
