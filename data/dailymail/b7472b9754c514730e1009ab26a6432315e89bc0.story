Ministers have been warned to stop wasting money on projects such as climate-change schemes in wealthy countries.

Development Secretary Justine Greening fears British taxpayers are funding poorly run projects in middle-income countries that do not need support.

Miss Greening warns ministers in a letter that they risk breaching international protocols and face investigation by Britain’s aid watchdog if they continue to spend money on anything other than countries in extreme poverty.

Wasteful? Projects funded with Britain's generous aid budget include the 'Ethiopian Spice Girls' Yegna, who received £3.8million

Hot air: British aid to China is being used to upgrade business parks, promote trade union rights and fund training for gay rights activists. £15million has also been used to curb the flatulence of Colombian cows (above)

Recent projects to draw criticism include £3.8million spent on an Ethiopian girl band, and a £15million fund to curb the flatulence of Colombian cows.

Although she did not single out any departments in the letter, seen by the Daily Telegraph, Mrs Greening fears that spending by the Department for Energy and Climate Change (Decc), in particular, on wasteful projects could undermine public support for overseas aid.

The department, run by Liberal Democrat Ed Davey, recently gave £15million to cattle ranchers in Colombia, the world’s 30th richest country, to help cut flatulence in cows.

It also funded projects in Turkey and Chile, which have also enjoyed rapid economic growth.

Relief: Ministers have been warned to focus efforts on genuine hardship, such as that caused by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, where Britain was active in rescue efforts

Miss Greening’s department, which 
accounts for a large share of aid spending, has cut back funds from 43 
countries to 28, including ending support to Russia and China.

'We send money all over the world. Now we need to give people down here the hope that they will get what they need'

In
 2012, the UK spent £8.62 billion in overseas development assistance, 
with 87 per cent, or £7.53billion, spent by Mrs Greening’s department.

The
 rest of the budget was spent by bodies which include the Foreign Office
 (£268 million), Decc (£241million) and the UN and other global agencies
 (£107 million).

The Department of Health, the 
Department for Work and Pensions, the Home Office and the Department for
 Culture, Media and Sport also have aid budgets.

Closer to home: The Mail has led calls for the aid budget to be diverted to help Britons suffering in the floods. Pictured is Tricia Tompkins in her garden in Wraysbury, Berkshire

Need: The Daily Mail has highlighted the plight of those whose lives have been made a misery by UK flooding and almost 250,000 have now signed a petition calling for overseas aid funds to be used for flood relief

The
 Department for International Development spent £3.8million on a girl 
band called Yegna, dubbed the Ethiopian ‘Spice Girls’.

Warning: The letter was sent by Development Secretary Justine Greening

The five-strong group launched a radio show and released a string of videos that aim to empower women in the African country.

Miss Greening’s letter, which was sent on December 23, was copied to the Prime Minister and Nick Clegg.

She
 warned her colleagues that aid spending must meet the strict criteria 
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the 
global club of developed countries.

Departments
 that fund wasteful projects may face investigation by the Independent 
Commission on Aid Impact, Britain’s aid watchdog.

She
 wrote: ‘We are making sure spending is targeted to where it is needed 
the most. Taxpayers rightly expect all overseas development aid, 
irrespective of the spending department, to be high quality and well 
targeted.

‘All departments need to make sure they are delivering this and show they are meeting the OECD eligibility criteria.’

Mrs
 Greening has asked her officials to work with departments including the
 Foreign Office, Defra and HMRC to ‘provide best practice advice’.

Ian Liddell-Grainger, a Tory MP whose Bridgwater constituency includes the Somerset Levels, said: ‘We send money all over the world. Now we need to give people down here the hope that they will get what they need.’

A Decc spokesman said: ‘Around two thirds of greenhouse gas emissions are forecast to come from the developing world by 2020, so it is key to help those countries switch to renewables like wind and solar, and so stop climate change.’

Britain’s aid budget has increased by 30 per cent in the last year to £11billion.

Plea: Ian Liddell-Grainger (right, with David Cameron), a Tory MP whose Bridgwater constituency includes the Somerset Levels, said 'we need to give people down here the hope that they will get what they need'

Assistance: Members of the Surrey Fire and Rescue Service help make adjustments to a high volume pump to remove water from a housing estate in Staines-upon-Thames, Surrey

The Government has set a target of spending 0.7 per cent of GDP on foreign aid, but it remains a highly charged issue.

'Taxpayers rightly expect all overseas development aid, irrespective of the spending department, to be high quality and well targeted'

Justine Greening, Development Secretary

The Daily Mail’s petition to divert foreign aid to help the flood crisis has attracted more than 230,000 signatures.

Last
 week, Mr Davey used the flood crisis to launch an attack on 
‘diabolical’ and ‘wilfully ignorant, head in the sand, nimbyist’ 
Conservatives who question climate change.

In
 January, the Mail revealed that Britain spent nearly £500 million on 
aid in corrupt countries including Afghanistan, North Korea, Somalia and
 South Sudan.
