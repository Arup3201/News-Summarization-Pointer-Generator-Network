The horrifying video of the mass murder of Syrian soldiers and an American aid worker is very different from other Islamic State propaganda films.

Posted Sunday morning, it shows how the jihadists are seeking to heighten the disgust they provoke.

Security and military analysts believe this new tactic is a plot to lure Western and other forces into a full-scale ground offensive IS leaders think they can win.

The analysts reckon IS is already reeling from air attacks that have stopped it taking the key Syrian border town of Kobane.

The murder of US aid worker Peter Kassig is not shown in the latest film – thought to feature UK medical student Nasser Muthana – and he does not deliver a final message as other hostages have.

There is also no announcement of the name of the next victim.

And for the first time the Islamic militants give away their location – showing what is believed to be Dabiq, a town in northern Syria – in the video’s background.

PROPAGANDA MASQUERADING AS A HISTORY LESSON

Lasting 15 minutes and 53 seconds, the video – titled ‘Although the disbelievers dislike it’ – starts with a documentary-style history of Islamic State since the invasion of Iraq by western allies in 2003.

It is in a different style from the rest of the footage, with more sophisticated graphics, and a treatment often used for major ‘state of the nation’ productions. 

There are scenes of bombings, summary executions and graphic video footage of dead civilians lying in the streets. It also shows what appears to be a dead child lying on a bed covered in blood.

Some of the footage of the bombings has not been seen before, though other scenes showing the summary killings of suspected Iraqi soldiers has. It is designed to incite supporters and operatives back in the UK by justifying their actions and setting the stage for the next clip.

Still covered up: Jihadi John has so far shown the world only his eyes

THE RETURN OF JIHADI JOHN WITH 16 FOLLOWERS

Filmed in the desert, the self-declared murderer, known as Jihadi John, is seen leading a line of Syrian troops to their deaths. 

A few paces behind him – and in the middle of a 16-strong line of Islamist jihadists said to be from over six countries – is the man believed to be Muthana, a 20-year-old from Cardiff.

Like the other jihadists he is unmasked. John however keeps to his habit of showing only his eyes.

Muthana clutches the scruff of the neck of a Syrian soldier, whose hands are bound with plastic ties. But while the other militants have expressionless faces – this young bearded man looks menacingly into the distance. Taking the lead from John and those in the line before him, he brandishes a military knife taken from a box of weapons.

The chilling sound of a blade being drawn can be heard above the sound of Islamic music in the background. The prisoners are not wearing Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits, as in previous videos, but are dressed in black trousers and shirts.

John, who has leather shoulder holsters for hand guns and a balaclava-style mask, takes centre stage. 

His appearance would seem to confirm his seniority and status as ‘chief executioner’ of Islamic State. The man thought to be Muthana stands to his right. John delivers his message to America and Britain before an eerie silence during which the camera zooms in on the faces of the killers, who remain impassive throughout.

The scene then focuses on John – who begins to cut his prisoner’s neck – quelling suspicion that he himself did not actually perform the previous beheadings.

Unlike the apparent murders of Western hostages, in which the camera cuts away at the moment their throats are cut, the killings of the soldiers are shown in full.

The camera zooms in on Jihadi John and his victim who, in his final agonising moments, closes his eyes. John then looks threateningly into the camera while still holding the knife. The next clip shows a knife slicing into the necks of Syrian soldiers followed by a stream of blood that turns the sand red.

The image after that shows the soldiers’ heads on top of their bent-over bodies.

The mass beheading is a new departure because previous mass executions have been undertaken using guns.

The fact that John’s accomplices revealed their identities suggests they have no intention of returning to their home countries. A caption refers to them as ‘hungry lions whose drink is blood and play is carnage’.

SITE OF FINAL BATTLE WITH ‘CRUSADERS’

As with the other clips, it is not clear when the final scene was actually filmed – though it is claimed to have been shot in Dabiq in northern Syria.

John’s face is in shadow and it is hard to make out – but his mannerisms seem to be the same as in other videos. He talks with his now-familiar London accent. 

An image is shown of a man’s head lying on the ground next to a man wearing desert boots – before the camera jumps to Jihadi John.

Mr Kassig's beheading is not shown nor does he give a statement supporting IS propaganda in the video

While his death has not been verified, John says: ‘This is Peter Edward Kassig, a US citizen of your country.

‘Peter, who fought against the Muslims in Iraq while serving as a soldier under the American army, doesn’t have much to say. His previous cellmates have already spoken on his behalf.’

Mr Kassig’s beheading is not shown – nor does he give a statement spurting IS propaganda. He may have refused to do so – or it may mark a change in tactics by the militants.

A dateline on the video says it was shot in Dabiq, near Aleppo, a place cherished by Islamic State militants.

According to one reading of Islamic tradition, there will be a final battle there between good and evil – in this case Muslim and Christian armies.

The ‘Western Crusaders’ will eventually be destroyed, according to the reading.

Analysts said the change of location may also suggest that John and the hostages were being moved more frequently than normal to avoid coalition air strikes and to thwart rescue attempts.

WHAT ABOUT THE BRITON JOHN CANTLIE?

Unlike previous Islamic State beheading videos of Western hostages, there was no reference to further deaths.

In the earlier films John had warned of the next hostage to die, showing a clip of them on their knees and wearing an orange jumpsuit.

John Cantlie, the British journalist, is currently being held by Islamic State jihadists and has featured in several propaganda videos for the terror group 

He has used the prospect of another Western death as a warning to the US and Britain against using military force in Iraq and Syria.

John Cantlie, the British journalist currently being held by the Islamic State, has featured in several propaganda videos but is yet to be named by his captors as the next to be killed.
