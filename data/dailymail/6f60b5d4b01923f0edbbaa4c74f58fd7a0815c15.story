Host commentator

So that's it from us. Thank you for following our live coverage of Liverpool's 2-1 defeat at Brondby. Join us again soon!

F/T: For Brendan Rodgers he'll certainly have a lot to take from this match. He may be concerned how his Reds performed sluggishly in the first-half but he will be encouraged by the performances of many of his young starlets this evening. Jordan Ibe was instrumental in their equaliser and was a constant menace to the Brondby defence when he came on. His efforts should have been rewarded with a goal of his own however, when through on goal but Rodgers should be pleased with how the teenager performed.

F/T: And breathe... For a friendly that was entertaining stuff in the second half. Hasani's goal was taken beautifully - beating five or six men before slotting home in injury time. If Lionel Messi had scored that people would be eulogising that strike for some time.

F/T: That's it in Denmark. The referee brings a close to an exciting second-half in Brondby as the hosts grab a late winner against Liverpool. Brendan Rodgers shouldn't be too disappointing with his young side though in their first pre-season fixture. Jordan Ibe - certainly one to watch for the Reds.

91 mins: Late drama in Denmark! Fehran Hasani weaves his way into the box before wrong-footing Ward in the Liverpool goal. An exciting end to a entertaining second-half.

90 mins: There will be three minutes of added time.

86 mins: As Liverpool did in the first-half, it's Brondby who look the stronger with the last few minutes of this pre-season to go. 

81 mins: Brad Jones is replaced by Dan Ward in goal.

80 mins: Deja-vu for the hosts as they hit the bar again from a free-kick. This time it was substitute Hasani who sees his effort cannon back off the frame of Liverpool's goal from 25 yards.

79 mins: Big chance for Liverpool! The impressive Ibe beats the offside trap but hits a tame shot at Hradecky in the Brondby goal when through one-on-one.

77 mins: The hosts make a triple change as goalscorer Norgaard is replaced by Phiri while Holst and Durmisi are taken off for Almeback and Da Silva.

72 mins: Brondby make another substitution as Alexander Szymanowski is replaced by Ferhan Hasani.

70 mins: The saying of a tale of two halves is an understatement here in Denmark. Both sides are now pushing to take the lead.

64 mins: So close from Brondby again! Riza Durmisi sees his left-footed free-kick hit the crossbar from 25 yards out.

63 mins: Jordan Ibe is definitely one to watch for the future. The winger goes on another dribble before cutting in and having his shot saved.

61 mins: Mikkel Thygesen replaces Martin Albrechtsen, while Johan Elmander comes off for Jose Ariel Nunez.

59 mins: Whatever Brendan Rodgers said to his players has clearly worked with his his much changed team having come flying out of the traps so far. A complete contrast to the first-half.

55 mins: Close! Brondby nearly regain the lead when captain Thomas Kahlenberg see's his free kick narrowly go past the Liverpool post.

50 mins: He's only been on pitch for five minutes and youngster Ibe is causing the Brondby defence all sorts of problems with his pace and trickery. An impressive showing from the winger.

47 mins: What a response from Liverpool. Substitute Jordan Ibe makes a beautiful run down the left wing before pulling a cross back for Kristoffer Peterson tap home. Game on.

The players have got underway here again in sunny Denmark.

And as said Rodgers rings the changes with Flanagan, Allen, Ward, Skrtel, Wisdom all coming on.

H/T: Brendan Rodgers will have mixed feelings going into the dressing room after that performance. Understandably Brondby have looked the stronger side but Liverpool increased the pressure towards the interval. Expect plenty of changes.

H/T: Liverpool have started to look sharper in the last 10 minutes of the match, but trail at half-time to Norgaard's strike for Brondby.

45 mins: Chance! Borini comes close to equalising for the Reds but his low effort is saved brilliantly by Hradecky.

43 mins: Waste. Having said that, Borini wins a free-kick 35 yards from goal but all Coutinho can conjure is a poor effort that Hradecky easily gathers.

43 mins: The visitors have started to increase their tempo in the latter stages of the first-half. The Reds have a corner cleared by Elmander.

40 mins: Both sides are failing to worry each other in the opposing attacking thirds at the moment but this hasn't dulled the fans spirits inside the ground who haven't stopped singing.

34 mins: It's clear at the moment this is Liverpool's first pre-season game of the 2014/15 campaign. Rodgers' side look rusty in comparison to the much sharper Brondby - who look much more assured in possession.

29 mins: Liverpool produce their first clear-cut chance of the match with Jordan Rossiter and Coutinho both seeing their shots saved by Hradecky in quick succession.

26 mins: Brondby's goal was deserved in the early balance of play as the Reds were forced to make a change moments before the strike with Kevin Stewart replacing the injured Ilori.

23 mins: Christian Norgaard scores a scorching shot from 20 yards out that leaves Brad Jones scrambling.

21 mins: Big blow for Tiago Ilori who pulls up with a suspected hamstring injury.

15 mins: Liverpool have their first shot of the match with Suso firing from 25 yards which Hradecky tips away for a corner.

12 mins: Brondby have started the stronger of the two sides and cause the first real scare for Liverpool with Johan Elmander turning Agger inside the box but unable to fire a shot away.

9 mins: Brondby win the first corner of the match which is cleared by the visitors for a throw in.

6 mins: Brondby deliver a free kick into the box which is comfortably saved by Brad Jones.

3 mins: Coutinho puts Borini though but he fails to control the ball inside the Brondby box.

We're underway.

Players about to come out with Daniel Agger standing tall as he leads his side out for their first pre-season fixture of the season. Here's the stadium they're playing at.
