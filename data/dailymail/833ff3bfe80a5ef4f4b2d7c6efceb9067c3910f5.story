She has had a successful Hollywood career since appearing in Leon at the age of 13.

And in 2011 she won a Golden Globe and an Oscar for her performance in ballet thriller Black Swan.

But 31-year-old American-Israeli actress Natalie Portman has admitted that her family life as a wife and mother will always come first, and that she is even considering becoming a French citizen in order to have the same nationality as her husband and baby son.

Portman married her 35-year-old French ballet dancer-choreographer beau 
Benjamin Millepied in California at the beginning of the month, and the couple have a one-year-old son, Aleph,

'Nothing is more important than my personal life,' Portman recently told France's Madame Figaro magazine.

'It's something which comes first, always makes sense, and compared to the happiness of a successful family life, everything else is practically superficial.'

Portman went on to say: 'I now have the possibility of taking on French nationality. It would accomplish the Francophile dreams of my father and myself.

'I lived in Paris when I was 12 and my father gave me the name Natalie as an homage to Gilbert Bécaud's song. Everything in my life has drawn me towards a French family.'

Indeed, we have become so used to 
seeing Portman in family mode - dressed down and 
with her adorable baby fastened to her hip - that it was quite a surprise when the star appeared even more dressed down: stripping off and going topless for a new Christian Dior beauty advert.

But little Aleph, one, needn't worry about his mother embarrassing him just yet.

The Oscar-winner de-robed for the classy photo shoot with photographer Mario Sorrenti to promote the brand's new Diorskin Nude range.

In one picture, she is draped topless over a chaise lounge pulling her hair off her face which is made up naturally with products including Dior lip colour 169 Grège.

In another close-up shot, she faces the camera with her arms and hair covering her chest to protect her modesty, while in another she is completely naked curled in the foetal position on a rug.

In an accompanying statement, Portman said: 'I chose the colour Grège because it's the one I'd pick to wear myself.The number [169] contains different dates that
are important to me and my family.'

Dior promise their foundation, which will be on sale nationwide from 14 September, will give wearers a natural, radiant glow.

As well as the foundations, priced at £31, lip and nail shades in a nude palette are also available. Natalie wears one of the Rouge Dior Nude shades in the adverts.

Dior said the lipsticks, which cost £25, are innovative because they don't colour lips but 'blush' them for a more natural look.

It is, of course, not the first time Mrs Portman-Millepied has taken her top off for Dior.

That first happened when she appeared in an advert to promote the brand's Miss Dior Cherie perfume in Janaury 2011.
