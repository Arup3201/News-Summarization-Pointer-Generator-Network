Liverpool are in talks with AC Milan about offloading Suso on a season-long loan deal.

Milan's offer for the Spaniard includes the view to a permanent transfer the following summer.

The Spanish midfielder officially arrived from Cadiz CF in the summer of 2010 but has only made 20 appearances in total since making his debut in a Europa League victory over Swiss side Young Boys in 2012.

On the move? AC Milan are in talks with Liverpool to take Suso on a season-long loan

The 20-year-old spent last term on loan at Spanish side Almeria and is likely to find regular first team football hard to come by at Anfield this campaign.

Suso scored three goals in 33 league appearances for the La Liga outfit as they finished 17th - one point above safety last season.

If the Spaniard were to move to Italy, it would be the second transfer to happen between the clubs following Mario Balotelli's £16million move to Liverpool earlier in August.
