The pretty hamlet of Bantham, which helped inspire Agatha Christie and is a favourite holiday spot for Sir Richard Branson, has just been sold for a bargain £11million.

It comes with 728 acres of land, 21 homes, cobbled streets, a golf course, a boathouse and a shop which only opens on weekends.

The entire lot has now been bought for £11.5million - the same price as a swish apartment in London's Mayfair, where modestly-sized flats can cost up to £20million.

Lieutenant Commander Charles Evans purchased Bantham in 1922 and since then it has remained one of the largest family-owned estates in Britain.

But the Evans family decided to sell up earlier this year, prompting fears the seaside community could be snapped up by a foreign billionaire and turned into a resort.

The National Trust was so worried about the pretty holiday spot being lost it launched a £7million fundraising campaign to buy just the beach and surrounding coastline.

But it was outbid and an unidentified buyer has agreed a deal with estate agents Strutt and Parker to buy the whole of Bantham, although the exact price has not be revealed.

Strutt and Parker partner James Baker said it is a family with plans to maintain and preserve the landscape the same way as the Evans have done for nearly 100 years.

'What we were very particular about was hand picking the right buyer and we believe we have found them,' said estate agent partner James Baker.

'There shouldn't be any concerns from anyone in the village. They will continue exactly the same as the Evans family have done.'

Prompted by a death in the Evans family, the sale of Bantham was hugely controversial, with many local tenants worried that the character of the village would change forever.

Strutt and Parker fielded calls from across the globe, fuelling rumours that a Saudi prince or a Russian oligarch would join the bidding.

Sir Richard was rumoured to have interest, having holidayed there as a child.

The National Trust emerged as a possible buyer after deciding to bid for just the beach and coastline for £7million.

However it was not prepared to take on the rest of the hamlet because it didn't want to become a 'social landlord'.

The National Trust currently owns, manages and cares for over 40 miles and 3,000 hectares of the South Devon coast and Bantham would have been its biggest outlay since it bought a chunk of the White Cliffs of Dover in 2012.

But announcing that their bid had failed, Mark Harold, South West regional director, said: "We have been informed by the agents acting on behalf of Evan's Estates that we have been unsuccessful in our bid to purchase Bantham Beach and Avon Estuary in South Devon.

'We are extremely disappointed at this decision. We, along with many thousands of people who have contacted us over the past few weeks encouraging our involvement in its future, care very passionately about Bantham.

'We believe this is a very special place, held dear in the hearts of many, not only locally, but also those who have fond memories of childhoods and family times spent there.

'We want, if possible, to work with any future owners of Bantham Beach and Estuary and ensure that this beautiful location is continued to be enjoyed by the many thousands of people who have told us how much it means to them.

'As a charity the Trust relies on the generous support of its supporters who help us care for some of the most beautiful and vulnerable stretches of coastal land in the country.'
