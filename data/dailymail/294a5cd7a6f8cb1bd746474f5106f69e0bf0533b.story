South Africans of all colours spent a second night joined in song, dance and tears in emotional celebrations of the life of the man who bridged their country's black-white divide.

With the nation still coming to terms with the death of Nelson Mandela's death at 95, hundreds gathered outside the home where Mr Mandela lived as a young lawyer in Soweto township.

At his home in the leafy Johannesburg neighbourhood of Houghton, where he spent his last sickly months, more multi-racial crows remained to pay tribute.

'What I liked most about Mandela was 
his forgiveness, his passion, his diversity, the impact of what he did',
said Ariel Sobel, a white man who was born in 1993, a year before Mr 
Mandela was elected president.

As
a dozen doves were released into the sky, people sang tribal songs, the
national anthem, God Bless Africa - the anthem of the anti-apartheid 
struggle - and Christian hymns.

Many wore the traditional garb of the nation's Zulu, Xhosa and other ethnic groups.

'He will rule the universe with God', proclaimed a poster raised aloft by a mourner.

President
Jacob Zuma announced a schedule of ceremonies expected to draw huge 
numbers of world dignitaries and ordinary mourners.

At least three American presidents will travel to South Africa to attend memorial services.

The White House said Friday that President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama would travel to South Africa next week to pay their respects.

They will be joined on Air Force One by former President George W. Bush and wife Laura Bush, who 'gratefully accepted' the invitation from the Obamas, a Bush spokesman said.

The White House said travel arrangements were still being made and it was unclear when the Obamas and Bushes would depart.

A memorial service for Mandela will be held Tuesday at a stadium in Johannesburg, followed by a smaller funeral on Dec. 15 in Mandela's hometown.

Former President Bill Clinton said he also planned to travel to South Africa, along with his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. It was unclear whether the Clintons would also fly on Air Force One.

'My whole family will be there' Clinton said in an interview with CNN. 'And we're looking forward to having the chance to say good-bye one last time.'

Obama also invited 89-year-old former President George H.W. Bush to travel with him to South Africa, but a spokesman for the elder Bush said he would not be able to make the trip.

Mandela's death has sparked an outpouring of memorials and celebrations of the former prisoner turned president who led his country out of apartheid rule.

In remarks following Mandela's death, Obama counted himself as one of the countless millions inspired by the South African leader. 'Like so many around the globe, I cannot
fully imagine my own life without the example that Nelson Mandela set.'
Obama said Thursday.

For Obama and Bush, the trip to South Africa will mark the second time they have been on the continent together this year.

The two men were in Tanzania at the same time this summer, though on separately planned trips.

They held a brief event together to honor victims of the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombing in Dar es Salaam. Mrs. Obama and Mrs. Bush both also attended an African first ladies summit during the trip.
