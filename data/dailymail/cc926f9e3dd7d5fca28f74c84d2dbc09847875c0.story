Terrified locals in China were forced to flee today when the blue sky overhead disappeared and it looked like a giant tornado was descending on their city.

But the black storm clouds were in fact smoke from a massive chemical blaze at a rubber factory in Jinzhou, Hubei 
province. 

The massive blaze was so large it could be seen miles away by stunned residents.

'It was so huge it 
blotted out the sun and we thought we were going to be swallowed up by 
it,' said one local after fire-fighters fought for hours to bring the 
blaze under control.

Fire investigators later said that the blaze 
started when stores of a compound called naphthalene - used in rubber 
and plastic production - caught fire.

Even after the fire was under control black clouds of smog continued to float in the air and lingered for miles away.
