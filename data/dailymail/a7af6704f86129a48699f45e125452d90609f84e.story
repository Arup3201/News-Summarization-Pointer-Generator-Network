One the most famous Fernando Torres videos comes long before his goal against Germany handed Spain their first major trophy in the modern era and long before those YouTube compilations of him turning Nemanja Vidic inside out as Liverpool got the better of Manchester United on a regular basis.

One of the most famous Torres clips is of him jumping up and down as a teenage ball boy singing the ‘ole ole ole cholo Simeone’ terrace song with his pals at the Vicente Calderon.

Torres idolised Diego Simeone, the captain of the best Atletico Madrid side until last year’s team that won the league. He has always been reluctant to go home but with the Argentine in charge that has changed. If anyone can put his career back on track it is 'Cholo'.

Fernando Torres claims he does not regret his time at Chelsea, but his goalscoring record since joining for £50million in January 2011 does not look good:

Premier League: 20 goals in 110 games

Domestic Cups: 7 goals in 19 games 

European competitions: 19 goals in 43 games 

Total:  46 goals in 172 games 

Torres earned a move to the Premier League after impressing for Atletico Madrid. The Spaniard scored 84 league goals in 214 games for his boyhood side before sealing a £20million switch to Liverpool. 

Atletico will get Torres as fit as he has been for years with famed fitness coach ‘Professor Ortega’ working on giving him back that burst of acceleration that he has lacked in recent seasons.

He will not feel too much pressure because Atletico have Mario Mandzukic scoring goals and comfortably filling the gap left by Diego Costa.

Torres does not go to his old club as the saviour. The expectations will not be as high as they were at Liverpool, Chelsea and AC Milan. He is expected to fill the role vacated by his old Spain strike partner David Villa last season.

But the secondary role will not mean he is moving out of the limelight. Atletico are very much in the title race and they have two massive cup games coming up in January against Real Madrid - local derbies in which Torres may well start because the competition is Atletico’s third priority this season.

The Spanish striker came through at Atletico as a teenager, becoming captain at the age of just 19

Atletico Madrid: Segunda Division

Chelsea: FA Cup 2012, Champions League 2012, Europa League 2013

Spain: Euro 2008, Euro 2012, 2010 World Cup

Torres has opened two gymnasiums in Spain recently. Both are being overseen by a close friend and business partner but now back in Spain he can be far more hands on with a venture he is hoping to expand after retirement.

And before retirement he can bring his career full circle, playing in front of fans who have always adored him and never held it against him that he left for Liverpool he will be happy again.

The Vicente Calderon hasn’t changed much since he left the club; Atleti are still waiting to move into a new and as yet unfinished out-of-town stadium; the team still plays in the famous red-and-white shirt; and Simeone is still the leader - albeit having changed the captain’s armband for the manager’s dugout. 

No wonder Torres has been texting about how happy he is to be home.

Torres will be hoping the move back to his first club will help him return to his deadliest form
