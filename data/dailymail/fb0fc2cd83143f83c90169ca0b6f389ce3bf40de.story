Boris Johnson is to study Winston Churchill’s rise from political outrider to Prime Minister, in a move seen as research for his own political ambitions.

The London Mayor has announced he is writing a book on the wartime PM, fuelling suspicions in Westminster that he is biding his time before bidding for the top job himself.

Doing little to play down speculation about his hopes of succeeding David Cameron as Tory leader, Mr Johnson said he wanted to show how ‘one man can make all the difference’.

Churchill Factor: Boris Johnson is to write a biography of Sir Winston Churchill, because hwa wants to show how 'one man can make a difference'

Some might argue that as mayor of one 
of the world’s great capital cities, Mr Johnson has enough work to do 
without writing a biography on one of Britain’s greatest leaders.

He already receives a reported £250,000-a-year to write a weekly newspaper column on top of the £144,000 as Mayor of London.

But
friends of Mr Johnson insist he is a workaholic, and is determined to 
press ahead with the book on Sir Winston for publication in autumn 2014.

Publishers
Hodder & Stoughton said the Churchill Factor would focus on the 
‘character, life, legacy and meaning today’ of the former Prime 
Minister, adding to the sense that this is not entirely an historical 
work.

The more mischievous 
will no doubt look for references in the finished work to Mr Johnson’s 
own hopes to swap City Hall for Number 10.

Mr Johnson said: ‘I am interested in the memory of Churchill, and how it has been distorted.

'I want to shine a light on some aspects of Churchill’s character and to explain how Churchill made a difference to events or to society – and explore his meaning and his message today.

‘He is the resounding human rebuttal to all Marxist historians who think history is the story of vast and impersonal economic forces.

‘The point of the ‘‘Churchill Factor’’ is that one man can make all the difference.’

Ambitions: Boris Johnson has said he would love to 'have a crack' at being Prime Minister if David Cameron was forced out

It is not hard to see how this remark could refer to the impact that a 21st century Tory Mayor can have, just as much as reflections on Sir Winston’s leadership during World War Two.

Earlier this year Mr Johnson finally admitted he would like to have a ‘crack’ at being Prime Minister.

‘I think it's a very tough job being prime minister,’ he said in a BBC documentary.

‘Obviously, if the ball came loose from the back of a scrum - which it won't - it would be a great, great thing to have a crack at.’

However, Labour questioned whether such a senior politician should be spending his time writing books.

Sadiq Khan, Labour's shadow Minister for London, told The Times: ‘Being Mayor is a full time job. There is wide respect for Winston Churchill but Londoners at this difficult time want someone focused 100 per cent on improving their city, not distracted by flights of fancy.’
