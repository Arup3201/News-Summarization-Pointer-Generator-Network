On first inspection, this just looks like an ordinary woman wearing a very tight, black T-shirt.

But look a little closer and you'll see that her 'top' is nothing more than a lick of black paint, which she's had sprayed on to look like a real T-shirt.

The
 blonde Danish lady can be seen having the black top spray painted onto her chest by a friend before she takes to the streets and nonchalantly strolls along listening to her iPod.

Nice top....Oh wait: This Danish ladies 'top' is nothing more than a bit of black paint, which she's had sprayed on to look like a real T-shirt

She then takes a seat outside in a cafe and orders a drink, even taking a selfie at one point.

The reactions of the passers by, which range from shocked and impressed to hysterical and embarrassed, are hilarious.

She then takes a tissue and begins rubbing the paint off before walking away from the cafe. A Danish phrase pops up on the screen, which translates roughly as: 'I'm tired of superficial things'.

The video is described on Youtube - where 
it has had 190,000 views - thus: 'This is what happens when you send a
 beautiful, body-painted girl on a sunny Friday afternoon stroll down 
one of the busiest streets of the posh and fashionable area 
Frederiksberg.'

'But
 it's what happens when she decides to sit down and enjoy a glass of 
wine and gives the gaping audience yet another surprise that makes the 
good citizens of Frederiksberg drop their jaws.'

Just like any other woman: The blonde Danish model takes to the streets and nonchalantly strolls along listening to her iPod

Awkward! The reactions of the passers by, which range from shocked and impressed to hysterical and embarrassed, are hilarious

The video was produced by Danish 
Production Company Eyeworks Denmark for a brand new dating format, which
 will be aired on Danish TV3.

Producer Trine Frovin told MailOnline: 'We are currently casting for a new dating show, but since there are a lot of casting calls this summer and we are approaching summer holidays we needed to “make some noise”.

But first, let me take a selfie! The model even snaps a selfie on her mobile while the other punters sit nearby

She continues: 'We decided to think less as TV people and more like advertising and do something different.'

'My producer Stine Stahr came up with this great idea. The exact content of the show has yet to be revealed, but I can say that we want people to date in a new and fair way where the focus is on the personality - not looks, appearance or personal branding.

'The girl in the video is a model because, although we are casting for ordinary people, we needed someone bold enough to take a stroll one of the busiest streets of Copenhagen.'

Remember her? A French model walks down the streets of Lille with jeans painted on
