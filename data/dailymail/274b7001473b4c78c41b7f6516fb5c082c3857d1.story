She retains an impossibly toned physique fit to rival many of the models who pose in her clothes.

And now Britons can emulate Victoria Beckham's fitness regime as the wacky Pilates-style classes she favours launch in the UK.

The fashion designer, 39, has been spotted attending Stott Pilates classes featuring equipment likened to a 'torture device'. The sessions see participants hang from a Trapeze table using leg and arm springs, loops to hang from and a 'push-through' bar for stretching.

Victoria and husband David, 38, were seen using the intimidating-looking Cadillac Trapeze equipment at a tiny gym called The Humble Abode while on holiday in Los Angeles in August.

A source said: 'It looks a bit like a medieval torture device, but it is absolutely the best way to exercise virtually every muscle group.'

Pilates is a favourite with celebrities and said to strengthen core muscles. Traditionally, it is practised on a table called the reformer, with springs and pulleys for resistance.

New Pilates-style class Stott Pilates started in Canada and champions use of the
 extra Cadillac Trapeze table to maximise gains. The apparatus can be used by beginners for stretching techniques or by exercise enthusiasts for advanced acrobatics, and the resistance work against gravity is said to develop strength, flexibility, endurance and posture.

Now people in the UK can benefit from the Cadillac Trapeze too as Stott Pilates, brainchild of fitness guru Moira Stott-Merrithew, launches at The Spa at Stanley House in Lancashire. Taylor Swift and Jeniffer Aniston are also said to be fans.

'The Beckhams train with a private teacher and seem to really enjoy using [the Cadillac Trapeze],' the source said.

'Victoria has been doing Pilates longer than David so is more confident with the moves but he is very enthusiastic.'

A Stott Pilates spokesperson said: 'The purpose-built Pilates studio at The Spa at Stanley House uses the latest and best equipment available, perfectly complementing its philosophy in the provision of health and well-being for its guests.'
