Louis van Gaal will be speaking in his pre-match press conference ahead of Manchester United's trip to Sunderland. 

The Old Trafford outfit will be keen to get their season up-and-running after they lost their opening game against Swansea. Van Gaal will be speaking from 3pm.

'I think Marcos fits in the profile as left central defender. Also a left wing-back.'

Right, here we go, and it is a strong start from Van Gaal who isn't holding anything back...

'Two weeks ago I was the king of Manchester. Now I am the devil,' he says.

Like I say, he isn't holding back...

'I was not hired to be fired, but to build up a team and that is a process that needs time,' the Dutchman adds.

Van Gaal's tenure got off to the worst-possible start with a home defeat to Swansea on the opening day.

Despite captain Wayne Rooney hauling his side level, Gylfi Sigurdsson then struck to score the winner at Old Trafford.

United will face Sunderland at 4pm on Sunday, and new boy Rojo could make his debut...

The Manchester United manager will be speaking to the assembled press in a little under 10 minutes so stick with us for the very latest from Carrington.

We're also hearing that new signing Marcos Rojo will be in town.
