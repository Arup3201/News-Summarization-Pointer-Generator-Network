Maybe it’s a good thing Shakira isn’t returning for a second season of The Voice.

The multi-platinum Hips Don’t Lie singer failed to guide even one contestant into the final on her first and only run with the talent show.

But the Latin bombshell was not the only ‘small and humble’ one – she gained a partner in defeat when Adam Levine’s final contestant was simultaneously eliminated too.

End of the road: Adam Levine and Shakira's remaining contestants on The Voice were booted out on Tuesday's show

Shakira has received mixed reviews for her banter and coaching choices on the primetime programme and the mum-of-one looked genuinely crestfallen when her final girl, Sasha Allen, was knocked out.

Despite Shakira’s confidence in her protégée's  ‘phenomenal voice’ Sasha, a young mother from New York, was booted out by the voting public.  

‘She works so hard and has so much determination, and that’s what it takes to make it in this industry,’ said the Columbian songstress before Sasha was sent home.

Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine also suffered a blow when his last donkey in the race, a blonde who models herself on Dolly Parton, albeit without the songwriting ability, was rejected too.

The Moves Like Jagger singer has spent weeks waxing lyrical about Texan girl Amber Carrington and repeatedly tried to convince viewers of her ‘talent’.

‘One of the best things about Amber is that she can do anything…the luxury of having Amber on your team is that she can do anything,’ he said before she was ejected from the competition.

The double elimination left notorious ‘booze lover’ Blake Shelton in top place with two contestants left - Country music cutie Danielle Bradbery, 16, and the Oklahoma-based duo The Swon Brothers.

‘I have been lucky this year, I have two acts with superstar potential,’ grinned The Dreamer singer, 36, who is married to fellow musician Miranda Lambert.

R&B singerUsher was left with his self-confessed ‘nerd’ and hot favourite to win Michelle Chamuel.

Michelle is also one of Shakira’s darlings, Adam keeps saying he’s ‘in love with her’ and as the weeks grow the humble singer seems to gradually grow in confidence. But the bespectacled Massachusetts native still looked shocked when she discovered she was the first contestant to be saved from elimination by the voters.

‘It’s crazy, every single person on this show is so talented that my brain is just like ‘wait…what’s happening?’ She mumbled afterwards to host Christina Milian.

‘Michelle is a winner… it’s about connecting yourself to a real emotion and she does that,’ purred Usher, an eight-time Grammy winner and new judge for The Voice.

Meanwhile lightly regarded four-piece Fall Out Boy dropped in to play the drum-heavy track My Songs from their new album.

Towards the end of the tune alternative music-lover Michelle jumped on stage to join in. 

In keeping with the show’s tradition for reeling in former contestants Team Ce Lo’s former student Nicholas David hit the stage.

The heavily bearded dad of three, hailed as one of the most talented contestants from last season, played a soulful new tune, Say Goodbye.

Then Tony Lucca, a Team Adam finalist from The Voice’s second season, played his soft rock single Never Gonna Let You Go.

Wearing a bowler hat Tony was keen to praise the Overexposed rock star in boosting his music career.

‘Adam is a man of his word, he signed me to 222 Records and he’s taking me out with Maroon 5, we’re going to tour with them in September,’ he said, speaking of the lable that his former mentor runs.

‘We really vibed together and became really close really quickly,’ agreed the tattooed ‘metrosexual’ from the coaches panel.

Before Amber and Sasha were guillotined the top five sang a final tune together – a muted version of Every Rose Has Its Thorn by glam metal band Poison. 

Scottish rocker Terry McDermott from Team Blake season three showed off his prolonged sideburns while singing his break-up ballad Pictures.

'I have pictures of Blake all over my mantle piece at home but I’ve been asked to take them down because they are inappropriate,’ he joked.

‘Every time I hear you sing I get excited,’ said Blake, grinning.

The contestants and coaches were given a chance to mock the each other - leading to myriad jokes about Usher’s eccentric fashion taste and Blake’s southern-gent accent.

Dressed up to imitate Usher Shakira pouted out one of his favourite mottos: ‘Luck favours the prepared.’

Adam Levine’s tattoos were also a hot topic for jest.

‘Adam’s tattoos are not real,’ said Blake.

‘I’ve seen him without the tattoos and he has a farmer’s tan,’ he laughed.

‘Well Blake has a tattoo of deer poop on a trail,’ shot back Adam in his defense.

The Swon brothers giggled that Blake has a ‘laugh like Santa Claus’ but he got his own back by making them wear duplicates of Shakira’s skimpy cutaway leotard.

'Unless you are Shakira you’d have to be stupid to wear that,’ hooted the Nashville

crooner.

Next week the contestants will battle it out to win the public’s heart in the season finale, where Christina Aguilera and Cher, 67, will be the special guest stars.
