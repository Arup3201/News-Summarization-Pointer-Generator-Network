A British street artist has teamed up with War Child, the charity for children affected by war, creating a series of three surreal new artworks demonstrating that the biggest victims of war are often society's smallest.

Slinkachu - famed for his witty scenes in which miniature models of people appear swamped in expansive urban landscapes - shot the emotive photographs using tiny models of children in playgrounds.

The original images are part of the 20 Years Of War Child exhibition being held at the British Music Experience in The O2 in Greenwich for the next six weeks.

Slinkachu's images - entitled Play Fighting, Hop, Skip and Jump, and Hide & Seek - were commissioned by the O2 for the exhibit, being held to celebrate the charityâ€™s history and its powerful bond with music and popular culture.

The three pieces, all created in 
playgrounds around London, hauntingly juxtapose children in war-torn 
scenarios highlighting the injustice of children affected by war.

Slinkachu, commenting on the newly commissioned pieces, said: 'I was more than happy when O2 approached me to create some pieces for the War Child 20 year exhibition.

'I've been keen to do something dealing with the impact that war has on the often voiceless victims of conflict - children.'

He continued: 'My work features the unheard, the unseen, forgotten and the often ignored people in today's world so this project was an obvious collaboration to get involved with.'

The 20 Years of War Child exhibition, supported by O2, will feature dozens of unseen photographs by iconic photographers, such as Mary McCartney, 'offering unique glimpses of globally renowned artists and capturing the natural bond that results when music and a mission connect'.

Mark Stevenson, Head of Priority and Sponsorship at O2 said: 'Our work with War Child helps to get their message out to a wider audience.

'The aim of the partnership with Slinkachu is to drive talkability and buzz around the exhibition at the BME. Slinkachu's iconic, signature art perfectly embodies War Child's message that children should not be forgotten.'

Liz Koravos, Development Director of the British Music Experience, commented: 'Slinkachu's work to raise awareness about the exhibition and support our vital fundraising efforts perfectly encapsulates the plight of some of the most vulnerable children in the world.

'His use of tiny modeled people, toy-like in appearance, negotiating an overwhelming world with a backdrop of empty London playgrounds is an important call to action for all of us.

'The Museum archives and celebrates music and how it impacts popular, social and political culture - Slinkachu's work is a wonderful contemporary example of how this impact transcends across the arts.'

Exclusive items from the 
exhibition will be auctioned in March to support War Child and the 
Museum.
