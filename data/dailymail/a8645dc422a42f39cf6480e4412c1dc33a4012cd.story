Pub workers and baristas could face an uncertain future after Honda unveiled a talking robot - which can open and serve drinks

Pub workers, cafe owners and baristas could face an uncertain future after Honda unveiled a talking robot - which can open and serve drinks.

Asimo is the world's most advanced 'humanoid robot' with Tokyo-based Honda first starting work on it in 1986.

The latest generation Asimo has improved intelligence, enhanced hand dexterity and can run forwards and backwards, climb and descend stairs, hop and even jump.

Asimo, which stands for Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility, will even recognise the faces and voices of multiple people speaking simultaneously.

Using the visual information captured by the two cameras in its head, Asimo can detect the movement of multiple objects, assessing distance and direction.

Its human-like hands can open a bottle, pour a drink and carry goods while also expressing sign language.

Standing at 4.3 feet (1.3 metres) the gentle-handed robot can also hold a soft paper cup to pour liquid without squashing it.

At full pelt, Asimo will run at 5.6mph - an increase of 1.8mph over its predecessor.

It can also predict the direction a person will walk and instantly take an alternate path to avoid a collision.

Smiley faced Asimo speaks English and Japanese and can carry a tray, push a cart and even play football.

It is also equipped with technology that enables it to maintain its balance even if its gently pushed or pulled.

The robot is powered by a 51.8v lithium ion (Li-ION) battery and can operate for approximately 40 minutes on a single charge.

The latest advancements take Honda a step closer to creating a robot for practical use in the home or workplace. Pictured is Asimo taking people through its development history

The latest advancements takes Honda a step closer to creating a robot for practical use in the home or workplace.

Satoshi Shigemi, chief engineer, Asmio, said: 'For the first time in Europe, Honda is demonstrating the all-new Asimo- the latest generation of Honda's remarkable research into humanoid robotics.

'Previous generations of Asimo have demonstrated incredible fluidity and speed of movements.

'The all-new Asimo takes this mobility, task performing ability and interaction with people to the next level and moves Honda one step closer to its ultimate goal of developing a robot that can be a helper to people in need.'

Honda said that Asimo is still in development and there are no existing plans to commercialise the robot.

Tired of arduously making your own cocktail when you get home after a hard day of work?

Then you might want to invest in Yura, a concept from Ukrainian design student Herman Haydin that will make your drink and then fly it to you.

The robot drone bartender cap apparently make a healthy cocktail, tea or coffee with accurate numbers of calories for your body.

The ambitious design is just one among dozens of finalists in the competition that also includes robot fish that clean your clothes and free-floating fridge bubbles. 

‘The main idea in the Yura concept is making custom cocktails or fresh juices for you,’ says Harmin, from the Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture.

Once a drink is poured on a flat surface the robot picks the beverage up and flies it to you. Yura, named after a ‘fine barman’ at Harmin’s university, would be in the form of a Parrot AR.Drone.

Water and other liquids stored on the robot would be temperature-controlled, so it could be heated or cooled as needed.

A logo on the side of the robot would show you how much liquid is inside and also its temperature. The ‘smart brain’ of the robot, which is Wi-Fi enabled, could respond to voice commands.

And Yura could also to tell you the number of calories, carbohydrates, fats and proteins in your drink. 

Ukrainian design student Herman Haydin has revealed his idea for flying robot bartenders (shown). Called Yura the concept is part of the 2014 Electrolux Design Lab contest. The flying drones would be capable of making hot and cold drinks and then serving them
