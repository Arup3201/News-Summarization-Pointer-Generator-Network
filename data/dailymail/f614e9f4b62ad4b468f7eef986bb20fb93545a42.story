A British chef died after accidentally inhaling laughing gas in France just two days after telling his family he was to become a father, an inquest heard.

Jordan Guise, 21, was found dead at his flat in Beziers, southern France, by concerned restaurant bosses after he failed to turn up for work on February 6 this year.

Stourport Coroners Court heard Mr Guise - who was originally from Kidderminster, West Midlands, and known to his friends as Jord - died just days after his girlfriend Kim Taylor told him she had fallen pregnant.

Jordan Guise, 21, was found dead at his flat in Beziers, southern France, by concerned restaurant bosses after he failed to turn up for work on February 6 this year. A coroner ruled his death was an accident at the inquest

Tragically, she miscarried their child the day after his funeral on February 24.

At the hearing into his death yesterday, Worcestershire deputy coroner Marguerite Elcock ruled the head chef died as a result of an accident.

She said: ‘He was a recreational user of nitrous oxide and paraphernalia associated with taking it was found surrounding him.

‘There is no evidence he deliberately intended to take his own life.

‘I conclude this young man died as a result of an accident.’

The court heard that French authorities gave the medical cause of death as asphyxiation through the use of the legal high.

Mr Guise’s mother, Leesa Malpas, 47, told the court how she discovered her son had become a recreational user of the high, known as laughing gas, in 2010.

She said that last summer, during a holiday to Malaga, Spain, her son was introduced to the gas, which friends had since told her he regularly enjoyed.

The chef, originally from Kidderminster, West Midlands, had just told his family his girlfriend was pregnant

When Mr Guise was offered an opportunity to work in France, he thought getting away from England might help him cut down on drug use.

He started at La Charniere restaurant in Beziers last August and was quickly promoted to head chef.

In November, Miss Taylor started working at the restaurant and the couple began a relationship. In January, she found out she had become pregnant.

On February 4, Mr Guises called his mother and father Michael, 52, to tell them his news and said the couple had discussed terminating the pregnancy.

However, his girlfriend decided at the last minute to keep the baby and Mr Guise had said he wanted her to either go ahead with the termination or move back to France to raise the baby, the inquest heard.

He arranged to update his parents with their decision a few days later – but they instead got a phone call to say their son had been found dead.

Mr Guise had just been named head chef at this British-French restaurant in Beziers when he died

Mrs Malpas told the coroner her son was not depressed about the situation and was ‘being very practical and knew something had to be done’.

She added: ‘I think he might have been high at the time.

‘I do not think for one minute he would have taken his own life.’

Speaking at time of his death from the family home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, Mrs Malpas said: ‘The cause of Jordan’s sudden demise is ironic - it was a substance that is freely available and a legal high - laughing gas - that actually took his life.

‘He lived his dream - to be a head chef in France.

‘He was passionate about his work and was very proud of himself, as were his family, friends and work colleagues.’
