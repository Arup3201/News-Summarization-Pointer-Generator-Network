A Royal Australian Air Force pilot involved in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet has become an internet sensation after online observers hailed his chiselled good looks.

Flight Lieutenant Russell Adams was interviewed on Australian television about his role in the search for the missing airliner - but online comments soon started rolling in about how attractive the young pilot is.

Comments include: 'Not to detract from the search effort, but Flight Lieutenant Russell Adams is a hottie', 'I’d like to debrief Russell Adams', and 'In another country, he’d be a model. In Australia, he's just Russell Adams... pilot', according to news.com.au

He is part of the Australian search effort launched after France provided new satellite data Sunday showing possible debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, as searchers combing a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean tried without success to locate a pallet that could be a key clue in solving one of the world's biggest aviation mysteries.

Today's search was frustrating because 'there was cloud down to the surface and at times we were completely enclosed by cloud,' Flight Lieutenant Adams told reporters at the military base where the planes take off and land on their missions.

Nothing of interest to searchers was found, he said, adding that the search is worth it because 'we might do 10 sorties and find nothing, but on that 11th flight when you find something and you know that you're actually contributing to some answers for somebody.

'We've got a lot of hope if conditions stay as they are. We're hopeful we'll find something soon.'

The new information given to Malaysia's government and forwarded to searchers in Australia shows 'potential objects' in the same part of the ocean where satellite images previously released by Australia and China showed objects that could be debris from the plane, Malaysia's Ministry of Transport said in a statement without providing further details.

Flight 370 went missing over the Gulf of Thailand on March 8 with 239 people aboard en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, setting off a multinational search effort that has turned up nothing conclusive so far on what happened to the jet.
