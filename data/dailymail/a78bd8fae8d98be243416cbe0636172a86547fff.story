Newcastle United have put no timescale on Siem de Jong’s return to action after he underwent surgery on a collapsed lung - raising the possibility that he will miss the remainder of the season.

The 26-year-old was initially ruled out for eight weeks but head coach John Carver says the former Ajax captain will only return when he is ready. De Jong also suffered a collapsed lung at the beginning of last season in Holland and has been plagued by injury since making his £6million move to Newcastle in the summer.

And Carver said: ‘It's a huge blow, but more so for the boy himself because he is such a great lad. We have not given a guideline on coming back - the most important thing for me is his health, and he will decide when he is ready to come back.

‘He will be under no pressure. We will do everything right to make sure everything is done for him properly.

‘I went to see him in hospital and he was in good spirits, but obviously it's a huge operation that he has had.

‘But they say once you have had the operation then it shouldn't happen again, so that's good news.

‘He’s had a tough time though,' Meanwhile, Carver confirmed that Paul Dummett’s season could also be over after he picked up a knee injury during last week’s 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace.
