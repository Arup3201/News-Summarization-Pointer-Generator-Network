A football press conference is not the usual place to witness a moment of heartfelt compassion.

Yet Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho stunned onlookers when he halted one of his pre-match briefings to welcome back ITV journalist Rags Martel.

Rags had recently recovered from thyroid cancer, and the press conference in January was his first  day back at work.

Fighting on: ITV sports journalist Rags Martel, 37, from London, was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in August 2013, after a friend spotted a lump on his neck

Mourinho was delighted to see him again, and quickly made his way  out from behind his desk to shake hands with the sports reporter while asking him: ‘All good?’

‘All good,’ replied Rags, 37, before adding: ‘It’s good to see you back,’  in reference to the Portuguese manager’s return to the Premier League club during the summer.

Speaking today for the first time about his illness and his subsequent return to health, Rags explains how the pair had become acquainted months earlier when he asked Mourinho a series of difficult questions at a previous press conference.

During Rags’s recuperation, Mourinho sent him a get-well card saying: ‘I miss a difficult question.’

The journalist reveals: ‘Being welcomed back by Mourinho was  a sweet moment, and as I’m a Chelsea supporter, when I got the card  I said, “This is almost worth getting cancer for.” I was being ironic, of course.’

He also found comfort in the  words of fellow sports reporter Clare Balding, who underwent surgery for the same kind of cancer in 2009.

Letting them know: Rags Martell told his colleagues, and the world, that he was suffering from thyroid cancer via social media

‘I heard her on Desert Island Discs discussing her own thyroid cancer,’ he explains. ‘I welled up and cried. She was talking about her treatment – which was very similar to mine – and the worry  of who you tell.

‘It happened so fast with me I didn’t have time to think. You’re told you have cancer, you get a date for the operation, and then the radiotherapy. Hearing Clare Balding on the radio was the first  time I had heard someone talking about surviving it and it struck a nerve with me.

‘I’ve never met her but I’ve met other people who have suddenly showed me their own surgery scars. That’s the thing with cancer – one in three of us will get it. I was perhaps slightly younger than most but it’s on the cards for a lot of us.’

Rags was diagnosed in August 2013. He says: ‘I was at a railway station early one morning when a friend of mine spotted the lump by the right side of my Adam’s apple and asked, “What’s that?”

‘I had never noticed it before but I saw a doctor straight away and he said it had been growing for many months. It baffles me that I didn’t spot it earlier because the lump  was the size of a small plum, but I suppose you don’t look at that part of your neck much.

‘The GP seemed concerned. He said it could be a cyst and sent me  to hospital for tests.’

However, a week later Rags was told his lump was cancerous and that he needed surgery to remove his thyroid. The butterfly-shaped gland is located in the neck, sitting around the trachea and just below the voice box. It is responsible for producing the hormone thyroxine, which regulates the body’s metabolism – including how fast the heart beats and how much sleep we need. Once the gland is removed, patients have to take a synthetic form of the hormone in a daily drug dose.

‘I was in disbelief,’ says Rags of his initial diagnosis. ‘The bad thing is you turn to Google for answers and you end up assuming the worst will happen.

‘I had a type of thyroid cancer which has a 90 per cent survival rate – but that still means one in ten people will die.’

Rags, who lives with his partner, fellow TV reporter Ria Chatterjee, says his first concern was how to tell his 11-year-old daughter Roxie, his child from a previous relationship. ‘I was very open with her,’ he says. ‘I showed her the lump and told her it was something called cancer. There was a lot of not knowing what was going to happen –  I didn’t want to worry her but I wanted to be honest with her too.  I had that worry of, “Will I leave my daughter without a father?” ’

Rags had surgery to remove the cancerous lump in his neck on October 14 last year. ‘Basically they slit my throat at the base of my neck,’ he says cheerfully. ‘I now have a 3in scar.

‘They removed my entire thyroid in an operation lasting about 90 minutes. I felt pretty rotten when I came around – very nauseous, and doped up on morphine – but then  felt better hour by hour.’

After three days in hospital, he went home and he says he felt completely recovered about three weeks later.

Show of support: When Rags returned to his job as a sports reporter for ITV, Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho stunned onlookers when he halted one of his pre-match briefings to welcome him back

However, one of his big concerns was 
how to tell friends and colleagues he had cancer. ‘You get those emails 
at work saying, “Hi, I’ve had a baby,” but it didn’t seem right to do it
 about cancer,’ he says.

Instead,
 while he was in his hospital bed recovering from surgery, Rags took a 
picture of himself and uploaded it to social media  site Instagram.

‘It
 got the job done but I was probably a bit out of it on painkilling 
medication at the time and didn’t consider what I was doing. I was 
fortunate enough to receive a lot  of supportive comments.’

As a follow-up to the surgery, Rags then received iodine radiotherapy treatment. Professor Christopher Nutting, consultant clinical oncologist at the Royal Marsden Hospital, who treated him, explains: ‘The thyroid gland absorbs iodine which you get from eating seafood and then converts it into thyroxin, which regulates body function.

‘By giving the patient a radioactive type of iodine in the form of a tablet, if there are any thyroid cancer cells left after surgery, they will absorb the radiation and die.

‘No other organ in the body is interested in iodine so it’s an effective targeted treatment.’

Rags needed only one dose of iodine treatment, although sometimes patients need more. An MRI scan is also given to see if the  cancer has spread to other parts  of the body.

He took the tablet in an isolated room in a London clinic and remained there for 24 hours as patients are left radioactive afterwards. ‘Then staff said I could go home but not to be in contact with children or pregnant women, because I was technically radioactive,’ he adds.

Rags returned to work in January, when he had that encounter with Mourinho, and is upbeat about the future. The prognosis for those who have been effectively treated for differentiated thyroid cancer is good – but they will need to be tested for the rest of their lives as there is a possibility the cancer will recur.

‘I have seen a patient where it has returned after 20 years but that’s rare,’ says Prof Nutting. ‘It’s a cancer that can be cured but may still show up further down the line, and for that reason patients need lifelong follow-up.’

Rags is still getting used to his new medication. At first his dosage needed to be adjusted as he was getting by on just three hours’ sleep a night. ‘I still think it’s all going  to be over but then I realise I’ll be  on those pills until the day I die. I forgot to take them one morning recently and was I falling asleep  by midday.’

Thyroid cancer has changed his outlook on life. ‘I’m more spontaneous now,’ he admits. ‘I’d always wanted to go sky-diving so I’ll do that soon. I don’t want to delay things because I’ve realised I’m not going to be here for ever.

‘Cancer is a way of telling you you’re not immortal and your body can give up on you and you will die. It’s given me a new appreciation of life. You just want to live life and tell your family and friends how much you love them. I have a more positive outlook now.’
