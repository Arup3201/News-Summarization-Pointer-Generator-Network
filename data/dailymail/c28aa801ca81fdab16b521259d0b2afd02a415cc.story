A 27-year-old driver has been arrested after allegedly 'doing donuts' on a frozen river until his pickup truck smashed through the ice - then saving his own life while leaving his pet dog behind to die.

Andrew Mayer was traveling through New Jersey with his two-year-old boxer mix, Rolo, in the early hours of Sunday  when he reportedly drove onto the Toms River, which had completely frozen over.

He then repeatedly drove his 1989 Mazda B2200  truck around in circles, causing it to plunge through the ice into the frigid water below, police said. Mayer escaped from the vehicle as it was sinking.

However, he allegedly left Rolo inside the truck, which was quickly filling up with water. Divers later found the black pup lying dead on the backseat of the sunken vehicle after a passerby called 911.

Now, Mayer, who lives in Toms River, Ocean County, has been charged with criminal mischief and careless driving, police told NJ.com. Animal cruelty charges are also pending against him. 

Daniel Jolly, 25,  was a passenger in the blue and gray truck on the day of the sinking. He has not been charged because he got out of the vehicle before Mayer drove it onto the ice, officials said.

Neither of the pair was injured in the incident.

Police and U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue teams were dispatched to the scene at 12.15am on Sunday following a  report of a truck 'doing donuts' on the frozen river near Gladney Avenue.

When they arrived at the river, the witness who had dialed 911 told them they had seen Mayer climbing out of the truck and escaping across the iced-over river before the vehicle went down.

As daylight swept in, a Coast Guard helicopter located a hole in the ice. Divers were sent into the freezing water, where they discovered the truck and Rolo's body lying on the backseat, it is said.

Victim: On Tuesday morning, Mayer's relatives insisted he had loved his pet dog (pictured) and had desperately tried to save its life, but the terrified animal had refused to leave the pickup truck as the water had flooded in

The multi-agency search for the pickup truck reportedly cost 'hundreds of thousands of dollars'. Mayer and Jolly both turned themselves into police on Sunday morning, according to ABC 7.

A police investigation is ongoing, State Police spokesman Sgt. First Class Gregory Williams said. A spokesman for SPCA added that the agency has launched its own inquiry into Rolo's death.

On Tuesday morning, Mayer's relatives insisted he had loved his pet dog and had desperately tried to save its life, but the terrified animal had refused to leave the truck as the water had flooded in.

Speaking to NJ.com, Mayer's cousin, Donna Jung, said the suspect had even attempted to get back inside the vehicle after climbing out in a bid to rescue Rolo, prompting his friends to pull him away. 

'Andy jumped on the roof of the truck to get back in as the truck was going under the ice,' said Miss Jung, who has posted several photos of Rolo online. 'His friends pulled him out a second time.'

Relatives: Mayer's cousin, Donna Jung (pictured, left, with her fiancee, Helecia Morris), said the suspect had tried to get back inside the vehicle after climbing out  to rescue Rolo, prompting his friends to pull him away

Hunt: State Police posted this message on their Twitter page on Sunday, saying they were conducting a search

Discovery: They later said they had two suspects in custody. However, they have since said passenger Daniel Jolly, 25 has not been charged because he climbed out of the vehicle before Mayer drove it onto the icy river

Miss Jung's fiancée Helecia Morris added that Mayer was 'completely devastated' and 'infuriated' with himself because of his 'stupid' actions'. 'He did almost kill himself trying to save his dog,' she said.

A friend of Mayer's, who wished to remain anonymous, described Rolo as the suspect's 'baby'. 

Mayer rents the basement of a home in Toms River with Jolly, according to NBC. He does not have a listed phone number nor listed attorney, and could not be immediately reached for comment.

During an interview with police, Jolly reportedly claimed he had climbed out of Mayer's pickup truck after learning of his friend's desire to 'do donuts' on the ice and arguing with him about it.

A private company is expected to be contracted to remove the vehicle from the water.
