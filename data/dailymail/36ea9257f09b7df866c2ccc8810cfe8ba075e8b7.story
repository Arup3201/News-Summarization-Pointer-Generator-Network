Facebook has responded to the outage that left users unable to log on for 30 minutes this morning.

'Earlier this morning, we experienced an issue that prevented people 
from posting to Facebook for a brief period of time,' a Facebook spokesperson said.

'We resolved the issue quickly, and we are now back to 100 per cent. We're sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.'

Facebook experienced an outage this morning that meant users around the globe were unable to log on to the world's largest social network for 30 minutes - and the error may have cost the California-based company as much as £300,000 ($500,000)

While down the social network showed an error message on its home screen as users struggled to log on.

‘Sorry, something went wrong’ the message replacing Facebook's home page stated.

‘We’re working on getting this fixed as soon as we can.’

At the time users flocked to Twitter to vent their frustration at the lack of service.

'@facebook is still down! This is the longest I remember,' said one.

'facebook is down! I don't think I've ever seen that before,' said another.

Website downdetector.com said there were over 6,000 reports from users of Facebook being down during the outage.

78 per cent reported a total blackout, while 21 per cent were unable to log in.

Website downdetector.com showed a map of where Facebook outages were being reported around the globe. The most reports were in Europe, where many users were awake and trying to access the website, while in the U.S. there were less reports as it was the middle of the night for most there

A server status check for Facebook showed that the website was unavailable - but the social network says it is now operating at 100 per cent again after the 30-minute outage left users across the globe without access

This isn't the first time the company has experienced a major outage.

In October 2013 the social network was down for four hours, with the site blaming the outage on 'network maintenance.'

Facebook prevented people from posting new statuses, writing on walls and making payments.

Reports suggest the tech giant makes about £8,800 ($15,000) in revenue every 60 seconds.

This would suggest the latest outage lasting just 30 minutes cost the company almost £300,000 ($500,000).

Facebook users took to other social networks on 21 October 2013 as well to complain that the site wouldn't let them post a new status. Pages and profiles loaded and users could click and view photos, but they were prevented from posting anything new
