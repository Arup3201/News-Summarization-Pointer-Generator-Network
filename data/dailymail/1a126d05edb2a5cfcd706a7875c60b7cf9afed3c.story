This albino squirrel has become a regular dinner guest in one West Lothian garden.

The cheeky rare creature - a grey by breed but completely white from head to claws - clambers onto Adele Logan’s bird feeder and snacks on peanuts and other delicacies.

Mrs Logan, 47, a civil servant from Bellsquarry, has named him Albert and said (Thur): 'Albert first appeared during the terrible winter of December 2010.

'Since then he has made regular appearances. He comes along for his feed and then off he pops.

Scottish SPCA National Wildlife Rescue Centre Manager Colin Seddon said: 'Albino grey squirrels are rare, largely because their colour makes them more visible to predators such as birds of prey and domestic cats.

'It’s possible if there is one albino grey squirrel in this area, there may be others nearby. In some parts of southern England people have reported seeing several albino squirrels at a time.'

Only one in 100,000 squirrels is an albino. Albino animals have always fascinated humans and when discovered in the wild are often put in zoo's or circuses.

Famous Albino animal attractions include Snowflake the Gorilla who had thousands of visitors come an pay their respects to his home in Barcelona Zoo when it was announced he had terminal skin cancer.

Although it is rare that albino animals in the wild survive as their fur make them stand out and proves difficult to camouflage, it appears tough little Albert doesn't need to worry about holding his own in the wild, according to Mrs Logan.

'Another grey squirrel appeared briefly but Albert saw him off,' she said.
