A greeting card company hoping for a laugh used a doll meant
for Muslim girls as the basis for a birthday card that depicts a headscarf-wearing
little girl as a terrorist.

In a pink hijab, or headscarf, and flowered dress, a doll is
depicted on the card saying things like ‘Pull string for message IF YOU DARE!’
and ‘She’ll love you to death!’ insinuating that the innocent-looking
Muslim is a suicide bomber.

Joke? A greeting card company published this parody card (pictured) of a talking Muslim doll that suggests the girl in a headscarf is a terrorist

The card appears to be based on a real doll meant for
actual Muslim girls.

The Aamina Muslim Doll, 
which speaks phrases in Arabic, is the brainchild of a mother who
couldn’t find dolls that resembled her daughter.

‘It all started when my daughter was 2 ½ years old,’ writes
founder Farzana Rahman on her company website.

‘I was trying to find toys that
would help her to speak her mother tongue, Urdu. Failing to find anything, I
embarked upon designing a talking Urdu doll myself.’

The doll, which has a male counterpart in the Yousuf doll, was the
first of many products created by Rahman to celebrate Muslim and Arab culture
with toys.

Aamina wears a pink hijab and a dress with flowers, just like
the girl on the card.

That message has now been made into a joke by
greeting card company NobleWorks Inc., a joke a Chicago-area Muslim rights
group says plays upon hateful stereotypes.

Real: The card bears a remarkable resemblance to Aamina, a talking doll meant for Muslim girls, from company Desi Dolls

Appropriate? A Muslim rights group believes the card is unacceptable and 'criminalizes' the culture of the children who play with Desi Dolls (pictured)

The card was first released in 2011, but was only recently
noticed by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in a Chicago
novelty store.

‘Islamophobic generalizations and negative stereotypes often
hit those who are most visibly perceived as Muslim,’ wrote Ahmed Rehab CAIR’s Chicago Monitor, ‘and women wearing the Hijab are often the group hit the
hardest.

‘Many Muslim women around the world, certainly in the US,
choose to wear the Hijab as a free-willed expression of modesty and
self-respect. For them, it is a message that men should address their minds and
not their bodies.’

NobleWorks, whose motto is ‘Dare to Laugh’ features an
extensive line of politically-themed humor cards on its website.

Messages: Inside, the card reads 'Hope your birthday is a BLOW OUT!' and it appears to have been taken from maker NobleWorks' website

Kids toy: The Desi Doll company also makes a boy doll, called Yousuf

A brief survey
found a card on which President Obama uses the word ‘cracker’ as a derogatory
term for whites, a card showing a quizzical President Bush at a dam
construction site asking ‘Are the Levees Jewish?, and one featuring two Native
Americans and the slogan ‘Homeland security: Fighting terrorism since 1492,’
among many others.

Also on the NobleWorks website is a personal message from company
owner Ron Kanfi.

‘I can only imagine folks and friends,’ writes Kanfi, ‘who
receive or read our cards, can help but wonder as to whether laughing is the
appropriate thing to do. But as our motto goes: "F**k 'em if they can't
take a joke!"’

CAIR responded in kind:

‘The notion that a doll, that looks like any other doll that
any little girl in the world would play with, can be presented as a terrorist
doll simply and only because it is a “Muslim” doll or because it has a “Muslim
scarf” on its head is not what defines “funny” for a lot of people, but
bigoted, ugly, idiotic, moronic, etc.’

The Muslim group said it has written an official letter to
NobleWorks sharing its concern over the card they say exposes little girls ‘to
messaging that criminalizes their basic identity for profit.’

The card appears to have been removed from the NobleWorks website.

Tool: The dolls were created as a toy that also teaches languages like Urdu and Arabic
