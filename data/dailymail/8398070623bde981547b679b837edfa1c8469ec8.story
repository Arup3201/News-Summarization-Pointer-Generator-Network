While millions of Brits swap sun hats for brollies today, this resourceful little frog was snapped sheltering from the rain - using a leaf as an UMBRELLA. 

Photographer Penkdix Palme, 27, caught the tiny tree frog sheltering from the rain in his neighbour's back garden. 

The aqua-phobic amphibian clung on to the stem of the green leaf for an impressive 30 minutes as it was lashed by wind and rain.

In this fascinating series of photographs, the two-inch high frog appears to angle the makeshift umbrella towards the direction of the downpour. 

Large droplets of water gather at the bottom of the leaf and surrounding branch while the clever frog remains protected.

Penkdix, who only took up photography six months ago, said he was shocked when he stumbled upon the unusual scene in his hometown of Jember, East Java, Indonesia.

He avoided taking a battering by the rain drops, which instead collected on the leaf above him

It seems the frog wasn't too fussy on which style of 'umbrella' to opt for
