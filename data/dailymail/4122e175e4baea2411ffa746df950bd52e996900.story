Instagram has been forced to apologize after removing a plus-size woman’s butt selfie.

Meghan Tonjes, 29, from Los Angeles, had shared an image of herself posing with her butt to camera, wearing a pair of black bikini briefs and T-shirt, captioned 'booty appreciation #honormycurves #effyourbeautystandards.'

She was furious when she received an email from the photo-sharing site notifying her that the image had been taken down because it violated the site's nudity rules.

This is despite the fact that thousands of Instagram users, including Kim Kardashian and ‘butt selfie queen’ Jen Selter, post similar photos on a daily basis without issue.

Ms Tonjes, who weighed 321lbs at her heaviest and has since been slimming, responded on Monday with a powerful YouTube tirade accusing Instagram of double standards.

In the eight-and-a-half-minute-long video, titled 'Dear Instagram', she says: 'I have no shame.

'I've posted photos along my weight-loss 
and transformation of me in gym clothes, in underwear, just photos of 
parts of my body that I'm super happy with and I'm super proud of and 
I've embraced getting older.

'I have pride for my curves. My still very fat body, I like a lot.'

The
 film quickly attracted more than 80,000 hits with many viewers 
congratulating Ms Tonjes for highlighting the issue of social media 
photo etiquette.

'You
 are completely right, when someone doesn't fit in the "normal" category
 of society, everyone grabs a torch, but when the torch-wielders post 
pictures like that no one cares,' one fan wrote.

Thanks to her campaign, Instagram issued an apology and on Wednesday restored Ms Tonjes' butt selfie to her account.

Instagram
 said in a statement: 'We try hard to find a good balance between 
allowing people to express themselves creatively and keeping Instagram a
 fun and safe place.

'Our
 guidelines put limitations on nudity and mature content, but we 
recognize that we don’t always get it right. In this case, we made a 
mistake and have since restored the content.'

Dozens
 of Ms Tonjes' followers rejoiced at the news that her derriere-baring 
shot had returned, with one exclaiming: 'Glad to see it's back! … Way to
 go! I wish my booty looked that good!'

Spreading the word: Ms Tonjes talks openly about her weight on her YouTube channel in a bid to 'create a dialogue, not about weight acceptance, but self-love'

Ms Tonjes, a musician and video blogger, openly talks about her weight and body issues on her YouTube channel.

She
 previously told 700stories.com that her aim is to provide the public 
with a 'more accurate and hopefully a more positive view of curvy 
women.'

'The goal was always to create a dialogue, not about weight acceptance, but self-love,' she concluded.
