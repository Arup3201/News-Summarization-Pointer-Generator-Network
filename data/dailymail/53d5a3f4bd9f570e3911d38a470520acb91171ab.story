As dream starts go they didn't come any more perfect than Andy Fenn's.

It was February, the season was just beginning, and on the Mediterranean island of Majorca the 21-year-old Scot sprinted in at the head of a star-studded field to win the Trofeo Palma.

Next day, Fenn did it again. Two outings in the colours of his new team, Omega Pharma-QuickStep, and two victories. And among those watching from the sidelines, and kicking himself, was Dave Brailsford.

Brailsford wondered whether, by not signing Fenn for Team Sky, he had made a mistake that would come back to haunt him. Because on that February day in Palma it really did seem that Fenn might be the latest world beater to come off the British production line, after Bradley Wiggins, Mark Cavendish and Geraint Thomas.

That was 2011 and since then Fenn's career has faltered. Which is why he is grateful to finally get his chance with Sky, becoming the first Scot to sign with the British team in a bid to reboot his career and prove those wins in Majorca were no fluke.

It's a move Fenn has been trying to engineer for almost a year. As he explains: 'I said to myself at the start of last season that if I don't break into the Classics team at QuickStep then I want to go somewhere I can at least ride those races.

'I was pushing to move to Sky from early on in the season, so it's a nice feeling to be there now. I know some of the people from British Cycling, but not all of them. So it's a new environment for me.'

At 24, Fenn is still young, but he admits 2014 was frustrating. His year could be summed up by a damp and cold Commonwealth Games road race, where he represented Scotland – although he was born in Hertfordshire and brought up in the Midlands, his mother and her family are all from Glasgow.

In conditions that forced flights to be diverted from Glasgow Airport, Fenn cut a bedraggled figure as he abandoned the race long before Geraint Thomas appeared on the finishing straight, arms aloft in victory. 'I had a really bad day,' Fenn says now. 'It was terrible.'

It was certainly a long way from Majorca in February, 2011. Yet when Fenn joined QuickStep, the Belgian super-squad, it seemed the perfect union. He is a big, powerful rider, with the potential to be a star of one-day Classics such as the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix – races dominated by his then new team.

But the all-round strength of the squad – with riders such as Tom Boonen, as well as Cavendish and the new world champion, Michal Kwiatkowski – made it hard for a young, British rider to break through – particularly one as quiet as the unassuming Fenn.

'I always knew it was going to be difficult because they've got such a strong group of Classics riders,' says Fenn from his home in Lucca, Tuscany. 'You have to really show something special, and if you make one mistake, you're off the list.

'I got my chance at [the semi-classic] Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne last year and I wasn't great there. And that was pretty much it, chance over.'

Fenn's frustration has been compounded by watching the progress of others: riders such as Peter Sagan, who Fenn beat into second when he won the junior edition of the fabled Paris-Roubaix Classic in 2008. Sagan is now one of the sport's superstars, recently signing a €4 million deal with Tinkoff-Saxo.

It's fair to say that Fenn has signed for considerably less at Sky. But the British team is one at which he should finally get his opportunity to ride Paris-Roubaix – famous for its cobbles, and known as the Hell of the North – which he is yet to even start as a senior.

In fact, in some respects Fenn and his new team are in the same boat: both have much to prove – and improve upon – in the Classics. In five years, while Brailsford's team has won the Tour de France twice, they have consistently failed in the major one-day events.

Now they have lost their leader in these races, the Norwegian Edvald Boasson Hagen, it opens the door for a talented crop of British riders – Thomas, Ian Stannard, Ben Swift, Luke Rowe and perhaps Fenn, too.

Fenn has just returned from Majorca and his first Sky training camp. 'It was really good, super well organised,' he says. 'Communication is massive and there's a really personal focus. Each rider is supported individually.

'We watched videos and talked. Dave [Brailsford] likes to make a speech – I've realised that. They do like to analyse things in depth, which is an approach that suits me.

'I also sat down with Dave and Rod [Ellingworth], who is now my coach. I was in the British Academy as a junior but never had much to do with either of them. They said: 'It's like we know you, but we don't, really.' So they're trying to understand me, and how I like to work.'

Ellingworth is the coach who started the academy, and who is credited with launching the careers of Cavendish and Thomas, as well as masterminding Cavendish's world road race title in 2011.

He admits that he doesn't really know why Fenn's career stalled – but he's confident he can jump-start it. 'He made such a great start, and he was given some opportunities, but for whatever reason he didn't piece them together,' says Ellingworth.

'His dreams are in the Classics but he was riding for the world's best Classics team. It's like a young guy trying to get in our Tour team – it's very difficult. You've got to be better than pretty good.

'But I've known Andy since he was 13, I've seen him come through as a schoolboy, and as a junior on the track and road, with great results. The talent is there, it's bubbling under: he just doesn't know how to get it out.

'I've been quite firm with him. I said, 'Potential is all well and good, but you're 24 now – you've got to show what you can do.'

Ellingworth visited Fenn in October and told him, 'This is how I work, this is what I expect.' He asked him to write a list of his goals, plans and ideas. 'I' m not a big writer,' said Fenn. 'Neither am I,' said Ellingworth, 'but this is your job.'

Ellingworth believes that Fenn has lost confidence but says he will get a chance to prove his ability with Sky

'Within three or four days I got an email,' says Ellingworth. 'He'd written quite a lot of stuff.' Ellingworth, who feels Fenn has lost confidence, was encouraged by that. 'Last night I got another update,' Ellingworth adds.

Of one thing, Ellingworth is sure: 'He will get his chance in this team.'

And that's all Fenn can ask for. 'It does feel a bit like coming home,' he says. 'It's definitely easier for me to fit in, though there are so many staff – more than any other team, so there are a lot of names to remember.

'But it's a clean slate. If you've made mistakes, you can move on. It does feel a bit like starting my career again.'
