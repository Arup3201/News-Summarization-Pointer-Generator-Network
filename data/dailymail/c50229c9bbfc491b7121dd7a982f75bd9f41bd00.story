David Beckham may have retired from playing last year but there has been no let-up in his god-like physique, as he demonstrates in his latest photo-shoot for his new clothing range.

Beckham is pictured modelling in his AW14 Bodywear collection for high street store H&M., showing off his chiseled abs and array of body art in a series of photographs that will leave the ladies swooning over the former England captain once more.

The 39-year-old poses in black and white underwear and loungewear in several candid photos, with Beckham sporting stylish, wet hair and designer stubble as he promoted his latest collection.

Beckham said: ‘These new pieces for my Bodywear range at H&M have a real energy about them. I genuinely enjoy the creative process with H&M and we have had fun this time playing with colour and texture. I hope people like them as much as I do.’

It has been a busy week for Beckham after he treated his mother Sandra to a VIP trip to Wimbledon on Saturday, where they sat in Centre Court's Royal Box, watching on as Spanish star Rafael Nadal overcame Mikhail Kukushkin.

David and his mother sat in their coveted seats just a row in front of another footballing legend - Sir Bobby Charlton – who was instrumental in encouraging Beckham’s development as a young footballer at Old Trafford all those years ago.

The pair greeted the Wimbledon crowd with a warm waves before taking their seats to enjoy the action.
