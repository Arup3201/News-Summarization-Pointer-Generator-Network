A family of four have put their efforts together and managed to shift a staggering 21 stone between them in time for a big wedding.

Father Tony Dorman, wife Jo and daughters Tanya, 25, and Anmarie, 29, turned into a super slimline family after vowing to tackle their weight together.

Mother Jo leads the way losing a massive 7st 12lbs, husband Tony shed 7st 6lbs, Tanyatrimmed down by 4st 2lbs and Anmarie by 2st 12lbs.

The family lifestyle overhaul was sparked by Tanya after Anmarie asked her to be a bridesmaid at her wedding.

And after ditching junk food and exercising, the new family are healthier and happier than they have ever been.

Tanya - who was a size 18 weighing more than 13 stone - was embarrassed at the prospect of facing the cameras on her sister's big day.

She said: 'I’d been a bridesmaid before and I was massive because my daughter was only 11 months old at the time.

'When Anmarie asked me to be her bridesmaid I didn’t want to see pictures of me at that size again.

'I haven't got any pictures of me at my biggest because I hated having my picture taken.

'But I didn’t want to be scared of the camera at my sister's wedding.'

When Tanya joined a Slimming World class her 20-stone mum Jo and Anmarie, almost 12 stone, went along as well.

The whole family, from Fairwater, Cardiff, cut out junk food, went on a healthy diet.

And 24 stone club steward dad Tony joined in the family fighting the flab before the wedding last September.

Tanya said: 'I had been a fat bridesmaid before and wore a size 18 dress. I remember having two dresses sewn together to fit me!

'I started my diet on 14 March 2011 and got to my first target a week before my sister's wedding. I had lost three and a half stone and felt so good.

'I manage to rope my family into my diet and soon we were all losing weight.'

Mother-of-four Jo, 53, said: 'Weight piled on when I started having children and I gradually got bigger and bigger until it was out of control.

'Trying to balance life and everything when the kids were little and trying to cook decent meals - sometimes you have to resort to fast food.'

Jo, a stewardess at the same social club as her husband, said: 'We would finish work and get a takeaway.

'I got bigger and bigger and my health was poor and something had to be done,

'Everyone wants to be around when their grandchildren are growing up and see them getting married off and I wanted to make sure I saw all that.'

Thanks to sharing ideas and tips the family has learned how to cook homemade food from scratch, using simple Slimming World recipes.

And making sure that they snack on healthy fruit instead of reaching for a bag of crisps.

Anmarie said: 'I always struggled with my weight after having my two daughters, and then I had my son and I felt massive.

'Before I was constantly choosing the wrong sort of food. The kids would come home from school and I’d put chicken nuggets in the oven.'

And all because of the changes in their diets, they have now shed a stunning 21st 10lb between them.

Tanya is now 8st 13lb and a  size 10. Jo is now 12st 2lb and size 16, Anmarie is 9st 7lb and size 10 and Tony is now 16st 8lb.

Tony, 55, said: 'I’m so proud of all the girls and Jo looks brilliant. It’s good when people comment on how good she looks because I get a bit of a buzz.'

The girls say that seeing how happy their mother since joining Slimming World has made it all worth it.

Jo said: 'I feel absolutely fantastic, like a different person. I’m more confident, I feel like I did when I was a teenager. We all live a much healthier lifestyle.

'If anyone had told me three years ago that I’d be eight stone lighter now, I wouldn’t have believed them - and now look at me.'
