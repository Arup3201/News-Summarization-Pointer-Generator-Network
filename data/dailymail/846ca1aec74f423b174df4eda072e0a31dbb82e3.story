The military dad and the teenage daughter he punished for her messy room by moving it completely into their Georgia driveway have made amends.

Craig Schlichenmeyer, who's only revealed his identity on Thursday, became a viral sensation after the stunt, which not surprisingly left his daughter Haley Sullivan, 17, flabbergasted.

But she's over it now. She says that despite the embarrassment in front of millions, she and her dad ended up 'working through it.

'Haley. room moved': A Georgia father who is in the army moved his daughter's belongings to the driveway to teach her to keep her room clean

'We ended up talking,' Sullivan told ABC News, 'and deciding that I would take better initiative to clean my room.'

The family says the dispute has ended with no hard feelings.

'Overall,
 it kind of ended up being a good thing,' Schlichenmeyer said. 'I'm 
pretty sure she knows where I'm coming from if I tell her to clean her 
room.'

At first, though, the happy ending was far but assured.

'I
 thought he was kidding at first, so when I arrived home I was 
completely in shock,' Haley said, after her dad told her of his plans.

The
 soldier told WSAV that while in retrospect he thought the move was 
'extreme,' he added that he warned his daughter to clean up or else be 
treated like a soldier.

Breaking the news: Haley found out about the stunt when she got home from school

On
 Monday, the father, who is a soldier based at Fort Stewart, placed his 
daughter's bed, desk, chair, bookcase and other items in the middle of 
the family's driveway in Ludowici, about 55 miles south of Savannah.

In front of the bed, on two large pieces of plywood, he wrote, 'Haley, room moved to driveway. Clean it next time.'

'I put everything outside to say we're tired of being ignored,' Schlichenmeyer said.

His daughter is an honor roll student, he added.

As an added incentive for Haley to keep her room clean, her father hired a painter to give her bedroom a fresh coat of paint.

Easy access: The dad said that the blow was lessened when he told his daughter that he would paint all of her furniture before returning it inside

Military leadership: Her father, a soldier, had previously threatened to treat her like they do in the military if she didn't clean up when she was asked
