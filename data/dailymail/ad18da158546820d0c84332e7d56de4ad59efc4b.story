The prospect of Great Britain's Davis Cup squad being bolstered by Slovenian wannabe Brit Aljaz Bedene appears to have been severely dented by the non-arrival of necessary paperwork.

There now seems to be no likelihood that he will be in contention for the World Group first round match at home to the USA in March, despite his hopes of becoming a British citizen by then.

The International Tennis Federation said on Wednesday that they had not received any relevant documentation before the December 31 deadline which saw a rule change hindering players from switching nationality.

Bedene, 25, has lived in the Stevenage area since 2008 and has already been ranked as high as 71 in the world, although he is currently down at a falsely low 156 after struggling with wrist injuries last season. Many see the athletic baseliner as having top 30 potential.

On Tuesday he was reported from India, where he is currently playing, as saying he hoped to be in the reckoning for the tie in Glasgow, the biggest on British soil for decades, as he expects his citizenship to be confirmed within the next week.

However, governing body the ITF said on Wednesday: 'We didn't receive any request regarding the Davis Cup before the December 31st deadline for him to be considered to play in the competition.'

Last year they passed a new rule – coming into effect on January 1 - forbidding a player to switch nationalities for official team competitions if they have represented another nation already. While Bedene has never played a "live" rubber for Slovenia (when a tie was yet to be decided) he has featured in their squad three times, the last being nearly three years ago.

It seems the only way he can now hope to represent GB in official team competitions is if he starts an appeal process, on the basis that his citizenship was imminent at the time of the regulation coming in.

He would need to be supported by the Lawn Tennis Association, whose lawyers have been involved in his application to become a British citizen. A LTA spokesperson said on Wednesday: 'We are awaiting a decision regarding Aljaz's citizenship application. Should he be successful, then it's a matter for the ITF as to whether he is then eligible to represent the GB Davis Cup team.'

Regardless of that, Bedene is still able to represent Britain as an individual at tournaments if he gains his passport, which is entirely up to him.

Wednesday's development solves any potential dilemma for British Captain Leon Smith about whether to select him for Glasgow, where Andy Murray is expected to play alongside James Ward, who is on the verge of the top 100.

The match is being played on an indoor hard court, but in future Bedene could be a real asset on clay, which he is comfortable on, and the weakest for many British players.

Smith has built a strong team spirit in the Davis Cup that Murray has bought into, and it might have been disrupted by a late incomer.

Although Bedene is a popular enough figure among his peers, when he first declared his intention to play for Britain last year it did not go down universally well. Nor was his appearance for Hertfordshire in the LTA County Cup in 2013 totally accepted either.

Former British No 2 Dan Evans was among those who spoke out last year, although the Midlander's plummeting ranking since does not see him as a realistic contender for the Glasgow team.

Evans might have been considered, but has somewhat vanished from the British tennis scene after suffering knee problems last summer, and is no longer part of any official LTA set-up. However, he is said to be training back in the Birmingham area and planning to come back at smaller events in the next month.
