It was revealed today that the personal trainer used by Toronto's crack-smoking mayor Rob Ford has a conviction in the U.S. for drug trafficking and is currently serving a 12-year ban from coaching in Canada.

As the embattled mayor embarks on his 'health plan' to lose 40-pounds off his 336-pound frame, Ford has announced that he is working with a team of professionals which includes Valerio Moscariello - who commented on Ford's agility saying, 'He knows how to move 300 pounds around easily.'

Moscariello was sentenced to five months in federal prison after pleading guilty to possession with intent to distribute anabolic steroids in Nevada, in 2005 and in January 2010 he was slapped with a 12-year ban in Canada for injecting steroids into boxer Amanda Galle - who also received a two-year sporting ban.

This latest embarrassment for Ford 
overshadows what has been in all likelihood the only positive to come 
from the revelations and controversies that have plagued him for the 
past two weeks.

His 
commitment to losing weight and to a healthy lifestyle followed his 
admission that he did smoke crack while in a 'drunken stupor' and that 
he wanted to moderate his heavy drinking.

Valerio
Moscariello, who is a native of Toronto, tweeted a picture on Tuesday 
of himself and Ford in the gym with captions that read, 'Toronto Mayor 
Rob Ford joins forces to get in shape with 'Teambodypro.com.' And, 
'#teambodypro Toronto mayor Rob Ford killing him on cardio today! Man on
a mission.'

Hard work: Rob Ford has become embattled in recent weeks as he admitted to smoking crack and issued strong denials that he has made inappropriate comments of a sexual nature to female staffers

He followed this up with a post to Instagram, stating, 'Putting Toronto mayor Rob Ford through a Valerio workout. The BodyPro training system!!!” The posts were deleted not long after he was contacted by the media. He deleted his entire Twitter and Instagram accounts later Wednesday.'

The tweet was sent out under Moscariello’s alias 'Valerio Mosca,' the name he uses with the Team Body Pro Athletics website, the bodybuilding supplement company Mutant Nation and on several socia media accounts including Facebook Youtube, Twitter and Instagram.

On his arrest in 2005, Moscariello admitted to possessing 27 units of anabolic steroids and to operating a website that distributed them.

In January 2010, he got a 12-year ban for supplying performance enhancing drugs to Amanda Galle.

'His 12-year sanction means that he is ineligible to participate in any sport at any level and in any role. This prevents him from coaching, training or competing, and restricts competitive athletes from associating with him as a coach or trainer,' the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport (CCES) said in a press release.

According to his Instagram account biography, Moscariello claims to be a 'Mutant Sponsored athlete Trainer of champions owner of Teambodypro.com have trained with 4 Mr. Olympians the best bodybuilders in the world.'

According to his Instagram account biography, Moscariello claims to be a 'Mutant Sponsored athlete Trainer of champions owner of Teambodypro.com have trained with 4 Mr. Olympians the best bodybuilders in the world.'

His website biography claims he was born in Toronto on December 22, 1973.

'I was always picked on in high school for being the smallest kid. When I got my first gym member ship for my birthday I was 15 years old and I was only 107lbs,' he says.

Responding to the picture he posted online, Moscariello told Toronto's National Post that, 'It was a joke picture and has been blown up for no reason.

'I do wish him luck. I should not have posted a joke picture like that I didn't realize what this caused. I'm sorry. I wish the mayor luck on his journey.

In addition to the clarification of the ill-judged picture, he refused to answer questions on his drug conviction or if he was continuing to work with Ford.

Tight fit: Rob Ford's weight was revealed to be 336 pounds on Tuesday and it was claimed that the mayor is keen to lose up to 40 pounds in a bid to improve his health

However, this contradicted an earlier telephone interview in which Moscariello had labeled the Ford enthusiastic about his training and that he had been working out the night before.

He even gave away the mayor's weight, which was 336 pounds.

'He’s got the discipline and he’s got the drive. I really think he can lose the weight, but he has to give it his all. I want him to give me 100%, not even just 99%. Without 100% I won’t take him on.

'But if he gives me 100%, if he comes to the gym, I’ll beat him up [through a rigorous workout]. I’ll beat him up until he can’t take anymore,' Moscariello told the National Post.

'With Rob, I think the problem is what he eats. He’s on the go, he’s here and there and he doesn’t eat what he should. If Rob eats proper food, he will change. But you need to do this every day. Every day.'

'You are what you eat.

'You’d be amazed how agile he is. He knows how to move 300 pounds around easily.'

It is believed that Moscariello was introduced to Ford through bodybuilder Jerry Agyemang, who Ford hired as a driver earlier this month.

Moscariello since-deleted Twitter reveals that he was speaking of training Ford as early as November 16.

He mentioned this during a conversation with Canadian porn actress Nikki Benz.
