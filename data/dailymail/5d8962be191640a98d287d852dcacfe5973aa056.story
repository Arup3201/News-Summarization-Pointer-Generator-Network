The billionaire husband of alleged child rapist Molly Shattuck has been granted a quick divorce and the legal documents immediately sealed.

Her ex-husband is Mayo Shattuck, the current chairman of energy provider Exelon.

Less than a month later, on November 3, Mr Shattuck was granted a divorce by a court in Baltimore County on the same day his wife was indicted by grand jury in Delaware. 

The billionaire businessman was able to obtain a divorce faster than is normally possible in Maryland, 11 News reported, as it typically takes at least three months for uncontested proceedings. 

Shattuck had been separated from 60-year-old Mayo Shattuck III. The couple have three children - Spencer, 15, Lillian, 11, and Wyatt, 8. 

Disgraced Shattuck was indicted last week on two counts of third-degree rape, four counts of unlawful sexual contact and three counts of providing alcohol to minors. 

She has resigned from her job on the board of the Baltimore School for the Arts in Maryland.

The 47-year-old allegedly became involved with the teenage boy in May this year when Shattuck posted a compliment on a photo of the teen on Instagram.

The victim replied with a private message of thanks, but Shattuck's son then forwarded his mother's cell phone number, saying: ‘You should text my Mom, she is obsessed with you,’ according to court records. 

The pair first met a month later while the teen was visiting a friend in her neighborhood, reports DelawareOnline.

The meeting ended with a hug but no other physical contact between the 47-year-old and 15-year-old boy, court records said.

The pair started to meet for make-out sessions in Shattuck’s Cadillac Escalade. Court records revealed that a meeting at an AMC movie theater was followed by another in a school parking lot.

In July, Shattuck picked the teenager up from summer school ‘five or six times’ at lunchtime and they would ‘talk and eat and then get in the back of the car and kiss or make out,’ police said.

It was during one of these incidents that Shattuck allegedly touched the teenager's penis.

‘Between their encounters, Shattuck asked for pictures via text message’ and he would send pictures of himself shirtless and one in his underwear, the victim told police. 

For Labor Day weekend Shattuck took her children and some of their friends - including the victim - to stay at a rented beach house in Bethany Beach.

'Sometime around 2am on Sunday morning, they drove to a liquor store and (Molly) Shattuck purchased a 12-pack of Miller Lite and a 12-pack of Bud Light for them,' state the court documents. 

Once back at the house, Shattuck is alleged to have performed oral sex on the boy at least twice - first outside the home while walking the dog and then again in her bedroom. 

The documents state '(the boy) described the undergarments (Molly) Shattuck was wearing when he entered her bedroom.'

Shattuck is alleged to told the boy 'if he wanted to have sex she would. The boy opted out. He decided to leave. At that point, she told him to come back later but he did not go back.'

The next day the boy's father collected him.

Shattuck is also alleged to have sent the teen pictures through Instagram of him taken at the beach over the Labor Day weekend. 

On September 26, the boy's family reported Shattuck to the police who executed a search warrant at her $2.5 million home on October 1.

The search warrant led investigators to seize her cell phone and her computer. 

Two days later, Delaware State Police became involved due to the seriousness of the allegations. 

On September 29, Molly Shattuck separately filed for divorce but whether she knew the investigation was underway is unclear.  

Detectives also specifically sought a pink lace bra and panties that the victim described her as wearing in the bedroom of her beach house. 

The grand jury indictment against Shattuck reveals that the two counts of rape in the third degree are for 'putting her mouth on his penis'.

There four counts of unlawful sexual contact in the second degree are 'touching his penis,' causing or allowing the teen to 'touch her breasts with his mouth,' causing or allowing the teen to 'touch her vagina with his hand,' and for causing or allowing the teen to 'touch her vagina with his penis.'

The three counts of providing alcohol to minors are for providing alcohol to three different minors.

Shattuck appeared in court last week where she pleaded not guilty to the charges. 

She was released on $84,000 bond after an arraignment on Wednesday at Sussex County Superior Court in Georgetown, Delaware.  

The indictment from the grand jury was also sealed, 11 News reported. 

In 2005, Baltimore native Shattuck became the oldest NFL cheerleader in history up to that time when the Ravens selected her for the squad on her first tryout. 

She cheered for two years and was a part-time coach for six more years.

Shattuck was a fitness consultant and advocate and published a book in February called Vibrant Living
