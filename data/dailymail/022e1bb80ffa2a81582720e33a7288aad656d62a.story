The former lover of the car mechanic who won £108million on the Lottery has revealed he never met a son they had together because the child tragically passed away at just nine months old.

Maxine Murray, 43, who lives in a one-bedroom flat in Lancing, West Sussex, split with Neil Trotter, 41, in 1992, while she was pregnant with Jamie.

But Mr Trotter, who became the UK's fourth biggest lottery winner last week, did not get the chance to see his son after ending the relationship.

Now, the memories of Jamie’s death have been brought back to Miss Murray after she watched Mr Trotter and partner Nicky Ottaway, 33, celebrate their jackpot.

She told the Sunday Mirror: ‘Neil’s smile made me think of Jamie. He was a very happy, smiley, baby. That was the smile I saw on Neil last week. It hit me hard.’

Mr Trotter walked away from care assistant Miss Murray when she was pregnant after a year-long relationship, but she insisted she bears no resentment towards him.

In October 1992, Miss Murray put Jamie to
 sleep in a bed  - but the next morning, her four-year-old son Leigh 
jumped into her bedroom and said: ‘Baby Jamie’s not moving’. She found 
his lifeless body.

Before Jamie's death aged nine months, 
Miss Murray had already lost a 13-month-old son Daniel to meningitis in 
1990. She got together with Mr Trotter when she was aged 21 and he 18, 
in 199

Unmarked grave: Jamie's ashes were spread around his brother Daniel's memorial in Streatham Crematorium, south London

Jamie’s ashes were laid around his 
brother Daniel’s memorial at Streatham Crematorium in South London - but
 he was buried in an unmarked grave because she had no money for a 
headstone.

Miss Murray told the Sunday Mirror:
 ‘I’ve thought I should write Neil a letter and tell him he can pay for a
 headstone now. But would I really want that to happen? Probably not.

‘If you’ve not shed a tear over someone, then you don’t feel for what you don’t know. The bottom dropped out of my heart when I lost Jamie. I was shocked, stunned, heartbroken, bewildered.’

She made friends with Mr Trotter after the loss of Daniel. Four months after their relationship began, she unexpectedly fell pregnant, but the pair split four months later.

Mr Trotter and Miss Murray have only met once since Jamie’s death, bumping into each other in a bar. They exchanged polite greetings, reported the Sunday Mirror's Simon Wright and Ben Glaze.

Mr Trotter said last week after his win that he had no plans to marry Miss Ottaway - his girlfriend of eight years - even though she has quit her job to live a life of luxury with him.

The couple insisted they had no worries about the huge win affecting their relationship. But Mr Trotter admitted he was not thinking of spending his winnings on a lavish wedding.

He said he did not want to ‘rush into’ marrying his long-term partner in case he ‘regretted it later’. A Camelot spokesman said that Mr Trotter did not wish to comment on Jamie and Miss Murray.
