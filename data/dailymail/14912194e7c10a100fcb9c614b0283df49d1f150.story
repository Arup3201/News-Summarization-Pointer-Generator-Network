Two vandals have been caught on camera spraying anti-Muslim graffiti - on the walls of a Sikh temple.

The CCTV footage shows a girl, dressed in black clothing and with a hood covering her face, climbing on to the shoulders of another girl so she can reach a camera and spray it with paint at 1.30am on Wednesday at the Sikh Gurdwara temple in Beechboro, Perth. 

The temple has been under construction for more than two years in Bennett Springs and is expected to officially open early next year.

The first girl is seen jumping as she tries to reach her target but the second girl leans down as the other girl jumps onto to her shoulders.

She begins spraying black paint on all the security cameras before they started vandalising the front of the temple.

The graffiti sprawled across the multi-million dollar temple included graphic images, offensive messages and racial rants including 'Arab f****', 'Aussie Pride' and 'go home'.

Architect Jaginder Singh told 9News: 'I'm Australian for many years. I'm ashamed to read this particular thing'

The incident follows just weeks after two Perth mosques and an Islamic school were targeted with racial slurs including 'ban Islam'.

It's been reported that the damage to the building will cost up to $40,000 to repair.

'We are not terrorist. We are very faithful to the nation,' he said.

Temple pastor Satjit Singh told The West Australian that Sikhs are a part of the Indian community and the vandals thought they were targeting an Islamic mosque.

'This temple belongs to the Sikh community and we have no relation with any other religion,' he said.

'All Sikhs, wherever in the world they have settled, they are very faithful to the country where they settle.

'It hurts me, and I believe it's insulting to the Australian community and the people.'

Following the anti-terrorism raids, Sikhs have reported a rise in abuse in Australia from people mistaking them for hardline Muslims.

Community leaders from around the country have reported rising tensions - and now Sikhs, who wear turbans and long beards, say they have been targeted.

Early last month, the nation experienced its' largest counter-terror raids in Australia's history, as police detained 16 people across Sydney and Brisbane.

Now Sikhs are facing the brunt of it, as Australian's mistake the religious group for radical Muslims due to their traditional costume.
