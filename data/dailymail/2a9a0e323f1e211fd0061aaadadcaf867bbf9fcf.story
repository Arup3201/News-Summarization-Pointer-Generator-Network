The landscape is eerily similar to Hoth, the fictional sixth planet featured in Star Wars.

And the camera angles make it seem as though there’s a Star Wars film on screen.

But it’s the Royal Danish Air Force’s F-16 on a low-level flight as it takes to the skies on a jaunt across the beautiful but desolate Greenland landscape.

The flight across the Greenland ice sheet goes along the ice rim east of Kangerlussuaq to the DYE-2 radar station, over the inspection ship Knud Rasmussen, and over the town of Ilussisat where the polar explorer Knud Rasmussen was born.

The pilot signs off with a sharp salute before he begins his ascent towards the skies.

The jet careens slowly and the aircraft slowly gathers speed, juddering as it races towards the end of the runway. 

The ground and surrounding landscapes recede into the distance as the jet takes off and meets the crystal clear blue skies.

The pilot steers it to a 45 degree angle and the view from the cockpit changes, as the heavens above run parallel to the ground below.

There is another sharp, steep turn as the pilot shows off his skills.

The turquoise waters of a lake reflect the hues of the clear and sunny day.

The sun, a bright orb, gleams, its rays piercing through the heavy-duty cockpit shield.

The scenery is breath-taking as cliffs rise out of the water.

The pilot races ahead to catch up with another plane on the right but holds back at the last minute.

Soon there are three jets ahead, accompanying the aircraft on its journey across the pristine Greenland landscape.

The camera angle switches to reveal the pilot, his face covered in an oxygen mask and helmet as he nonchalantly slices the jet through the clear air.

He looks behind, as if to say goodbye to the land before heading higher up towards the sky.

The bright rays of the sun pierce through the sharp, blue skies as the Greenland ice sheets sparkles below

What a view: Glacial blue waters and white ice 

Clouds engulf the plane, obscuring the view until once again the F-16 climbs, leaving its cloudy prison and the scenery is visible once more.

An icy expanse awaits below, with icebergs poking out through the water.

Shards of ice twinkle in the sunlight, ethereal against the dark waters.

The pilot waves at  inspection ship Knud Rasmussen below and zooms past, heading towards land.

A speck in the sky turns out to be another jet. The F16 picks up speed and the ground whizzes past, showing craggy ice blocks with breaks in between, where icy blue waters peek out and winding around the landscape.

The barren ground below looks cold and uninviting but the views are spectacular.

Melted ice form pools on the ground before the scene shifts to a pristine, snowy landscape as the plane rockets by, heading towards lush green hills.

In a matter of minutes, the plane lands smoothly on the runway and comes to a halt.
