Guilty: Reston Zoo Director Meghan Mogensen, 26, was sentenced to 30 days in jail for animal cruelty and llegal possession of animal anaesthesia

A Virginia zoo director has been found guilty of animal cruelty after drowning an injured wallaby in a bucket of water.

Reston Zoo Director Meghan Mogensen, 26, was sentenced to 30 days in jail on Friday after the body of the adult wallaby named Parmesan was recovered soaking in a plastic bag last January by a now former employee.

That former zoo curator turned whistleblower, Ashley Rood, testified that the wallaby's death was just the tip of inhumane killings undertaken by the director that included rabbits slammed into walls, chickens fed to pythons and others plainly shot. 

It was an eye injury sustained by Parmesan while hopping around its pen on January 26th that led to its barbaric death and disposal at the hands of the director, according to Rood.

‘I ripped open the bag and I saw the animal and it solidified it for me,' Rood described to ABC7 of finding the wallaby’s body soaking in one of the park’s dumpsters.

From what started as a bandage on Parmesan's left eye and his placement by zookeepers in a plastic crate for his recovery, Rood said the animal managed to bang his head, further puncturing his eye which started bleeding.

According to Rood, Ashley Mogensen asked the zoo's owner, Eric Mogensen, what to do. He told her to euthanize the animal, a decision that 'dumbfounded' Rood who believed its injuries could be treated.

'I didn't think the eye could be salvaged but it could be removed by a vet,' Rood said, according to the Vienna Patch. 'I told [Ashley Mogensen] other than that, he appears perfectly fine.'

Rood claimed Mogensen retorted with: 'These animals are Eric’s property, and we need to do what he wants with them.'

Mogensen, according to Rood, said she'd 'take care of it' and sent her on an errand after she expressed not wanting anything to do with its euthanasia.

Returning to find the wallaby missing from its enclosure and a bucket of water one-quarter of the way full sitting nearby, Rood said she put two and two together and raced to a dumpster to find the animal soaking wet while wrapped inside a trash bag.

Rood immediately announced her resignation and called local authorities.

'I told Meghan "I think you and your father are sick, sadistic people and I am not going to be a part of it anymore," said Rood. 'It is one thing to euthanize them. It is another thing to drown them.'

Appealing: Morgensen, seen holding a baby kangaroo in 2011, plans to appeal the guilty verdict

Injury: Parmesan had suffered an eye injury while hopping around its pen, one that the zoo's curator believed could be treated instead of being killed

Responding authorities who saw the animal's body were told that Mogensen had just washed the wallaby -reasoning its wet condition - after humanely euthanizing it with an IV injection of Beuthanasia-D. They turned critical when seeing the zoo didn't have permits or training to legally administer the drug.

Ordering a necropsy and toxicology test on the body, expert witnesses also reported finding neither sign of a needle's injection or a drug in the animal's body.

Instead there were ruptured blood vessels in its lungs along with plant matter and bacteria consistent with a drowning, according to Jaime Weisman, veterinary  diagnostician with the Virginia Department of Agriculture who was one of 15 witnesses who testified on behalf of prosecutors.

Mogensen has been sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $1,000 for the animal cruelty charge along with a $250 fine and six month suspensions of her driver’s license for illegal possession of animal anaesthetics.

Whistleblower: That curator Ashley Rood, pictured, said she called authorities who recovered the body which the director said was humanely killed and only wet because of a bath

String of abuse: The curator claims that the wallaby's death was the breaking point for her after previous animal killings at the zoo allegedly involved banging rabbits against walls and shooting them

Asked by the judge if she had anything to say before her verdict’s reading, Mogensen did not speak, in addition to not testifying during the trial.

'I don't wish anything bad for the zoo, there are so many animals there that I love and there are people who work there that do really love what they do and I know it's hard for them right now,' Rood told WUSA after the trial whose verdict she described being a major relief to her.

Meghan Mogensen is said by her attorneys to be appealing the charges against her.

‘She was concerned about this animal,’ Defence Attorney Caleb Kershner said in his closing statement according to the Washington Post. ‘It was suffering.’

Other zoos owned by Eric Mogensen have been scrutinized in recent years while this was the first against the Reston Zoo, according to the Post which also lists the current allegations of additional inhumane animal killings within the zoo according to Rood.

A request for comment by the Reston Zoo was not immediately returned on Saturday.
