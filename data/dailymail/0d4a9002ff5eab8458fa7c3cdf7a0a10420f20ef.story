David Cameron faced embarrassment last night after it was revealed compulsory PE lessons in schools have been scrapped – at the same time as he vowed to ‘get serious’ about investing in sport.

The Prime Minister promised to keep ploughing money into British sport  yesterday as he hailed ‘a golden summer’ of achievement by the Olympic team.

But he faced criticism after the Department for Education confirmed schools will no longer be forced to provide two hours of physical education and sport every week – a requirement brought in under Labour.

The previous government had also 
announced plans to extend this requirement to five hours a week. But 
this proposal was scrapped shortly after the Coalition came to power – 
and now the two-hour requirement has also been dropped.

He told Sky News: ‘I think its time to get serious about putting money into sport. One of the great reasons why Britain did so well in Beijing and I think is doing well at these Olympics, is called John Major.

‘He introduced the National Lottery, and that National Lottery has provided and will go on providing great funding for sport.’

Mr Cameron spoke out amid warnings from Olympics mastermind Lord Coe and former Sports Minister Lord Moynihan - both Tories - that money must continue to flow to top athletes if the UK is to build a worthwhile sporting legacy to the Games.

Education Secretary Michael Gove is also
under mounting pressure over his school sport strategy last night after
allowing 21 playing fields to be sold off despite a Coalition pledge to
protect them.

The 
Education Secretary invited accusations of hypocrisy after approving 
every request he has received to dispose of a school playing field with 
one application still under consideration.

Mr
Cameron said gold medal winning sailor Ben Ainslie and sports 
administrators have lobbied him for cash when he has attended events 
over the last week.

‘I was hearing that from Ben Ainslie and the sailing team down in Weymouth today, I was hearing it from Sport UK when I was sitting in the athletics stadium. The lottery has been a great boost to British sport, we must make sure that that goes on and is the case for the future.”

The PM said his highlight of the Games was last Saturday when he watched Jessica Ennis, Greg Rutherford and Mo Farah all win gold in the space of an hour.

The Coalition had pledged in its 2010 agreement to encourage competitive sport and ‘seek to protect school playing fields’.

But new figures released by the Department for Education show that Mr Gove has received 22 requests to dispose of school playing fields since May 2010 and has approved 21, with one pending a decision.

But officials pointed out that 14 of the 21 cases related to schools that had closed while four were sites that became surplus to requirements when existing schools merged.
