Three police officers in New Hampshire have been placed on paid administrative leave after video emerged which shows one of them slamming a suspect against a wall.

Seabrook town manager, Bill Manzi confirmed the men had been suspended and that an investigation had been launched by police chief Lee Bitomske.

'On behalf of the Board of Selectmen and the chief of police in response to the video in question, the town of Seabrook will conduct a comprehensive investigation into the incident,' Manzi said.

The video which dates from 2009 surfaced on YouTube on Monday and was apparently posted by the man thrown against the wall.

He claims that he has brain injuries from the impact, a permanent lump on the back of his head, chipped teeth and is speaking to a lawyer.

The video appears to have come from police cameras inside the station and is dated Nov. 11, 2009.

The 3.46 second footage begins with the officers escorting a man not wearing a shirt down the station hallway.

Smash: The shirtless suspect is battered against the wall with brute force by one of the officers as two others look on

Unconscious: The suspect lies on the floor as one of the police officers battles to lift him up and steady him on his feet

Suddenly and without warning, one of the officers rams the suspect into the wall which clearly causes him to lose consciousness.

The officer drags the man to his feet and then pulls him out of sight of the camera - but not before one of the other officers pepper sprays the suspect.

The names of the officers involved will not be released by Seabrook police and it is unknown why it has taken over 4 years for this footage to be made public.

'I know there will be a lot of folks who will rightfully have opinions about it,' Manzi said of the video to the Union Leader.

'My position is, we need to give the chief adequate time to get to the bottom of it and conduct a fair, thorough and impartial investigation and then at that point we'll be able to say a little bit more.'

The YouTube video is entitled 'police brutality in Seabrook Police station' and was posted Monday night by a person using the screen-name of Mike Berg.Â 

Get up: The man is so unsteady on his feet that he fails to plant his legs on the ground and stand on his own

What is so funny: One of the officers smiles as the suspect presumably lies on the ground

It quickly received thousands of views and has been shared on various social media Web sites.

The identity of the person slammed into the wall in the video has not been confirmed - but is thought to be the poster of the footage.

The description of the video is explained as: 'I was taken out and brought in the booking room to call for a ride.

'After calling a ride I was told I could take my phone that I called from and my wallet.

'As soon as I grabbed my wallet from the table the officer with the glasses came at me saying he never told me I could take my stuff and choked me against the wall then tried to grab the wallet from my pocket. Once he got the wallet and my phone this is what happened.'

Manzi confirmed the officers in the video are from Seabrook and it was footage from the station.

'In terms of how and why the 2009 video is just coming to light now, I don't have an answer for you,' Manzi said.

In addition, the description of the video says that the footage was in the possession of an attorney who disappeared for two years, before the man who posted the video, 'was able to track him down.'

The man has indicated he will be filing a lawsuit.
