Forget romantic small talk in the bedroom â€“ millions of us would rather reply to work emails than pay attention to our partners.

Almost half of 16 to 34-year-olds check office messages in bed on a smartphone, laptop or tablet computer, a study shows.

One in ten in this age group admits that they do so every day.

No time for love: Almost half of young Britons check their work emails in bed

And younger people, who usually have 
fewer work ties, are even more addicted, with 87 per cent of 16 to 
24-year-olds using a tablet computer in bed to access the internet.

Katie Toll, of Future Foundation, a 
strategy consultancy which carried out the research, said: 'It seems 
that for many, bedtime is not a time for relaxation any more.

'It's a time for connection via a multitude of devices.'

Startlingly, the study found that 68 
per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds never switch off their mobile phones, 
meaning they are always connected.

Homework: New research shows technology is breaking down barriers between work and home

The figures highlight an effect called 'work-life merge', in which technology breaks down the boundaries between work and home.

The study also found that one in four
UK employees works longer hours since the economic downturn, with 14 
per cent working weekends.

But in the longer term, the average full-time working week has shrunk, from 38.1 hours in 1992 to 37.3 hours in 2012.

The Future Foundation predicted that in years to come new laws will force companies to offer staff more flexible hours.

It said individuals are still likely 
to feel more overloaded than they do now, however, because they will be 
constantly connected.

The company said that by 2020, we 
will each have access to 6.5 smart devices on average. A Future 
Foundation spokesman said: 'It is a shift which poses the question: Is 
technology the enemy of romance and will the omnipresent BlackBerry 
replace Facebook as the technology brand most cited in divorce cases?'

*More than seven million UK adults have never used the internet, official figures show.

In all, 14 per cent of those aged over 16 have never ventured online.

Even so, nearly one million more people than last year have tried the web, a rise of 13 per cent, according to the data.

Significantly more women than men 
have never used the internet, at 4.2million compared with 2.8million, 
according to the Office for National Statistics.

Many of those who have never gone online (43 per cent) are aged 75 or over.

However, in the past two years the number of internet users in this group has gone up by 1.6million.
