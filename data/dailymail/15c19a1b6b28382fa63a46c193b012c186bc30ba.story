A teacher who claimed £1.2 million after winning a racial discrimination claim has been jailed for two years for hiding her criminal record when applying for a post at a school.

Samantha Burmis, of Bellman Avenue in Gravesend, was sentenced in her absence at Maidstone Crown Court today.

The mother-of-four had denied obtaining a pecuniary advantage by 
deception and perverting the course of justice, but was convicted of 
both charges last month.

Guilty: Samantha Burmis spun a tangled web of lies, including getting her daughter to pose as her to avoid finger print detection

She was not able to attend her sentencing as she had taken an overdose of pills and alcohol shortly before she was due to appear and was admitted to Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford.

Judge David Griffith-Jones QC branded the 44-year-old 'devious, manipulative and thoroughly dishonest', adding she was prepared to go to extraordinary lengths to serve her own selfish interests.

Burmis' criminal past dated 
back to January 1995, when she was jailed for a year at Harrow Crown 
Court for a £90,000 mortgage fraud.

At her latest trial, Burmis denied she had either served a prison sentence or had a criminal record, but police had her finger prints 
from when she was originally arrested.

Lies: Samantha Burmis had denied having a criminal record, despite police having finger print evidence

After her release, she studied 
law at the University of Kent in Canterbury, and later trained to be a teacher at the University of Greenwich.

She then applied for a teaching post at Aylesford School in Maidstone, but crucially failed to reveal her conviction for fraud.

The court heard Burmis made similar 
applications to Homewood School in Tenterden and Swadelands School in 
Lenham, Maidstone, again failing to declare her conviction.

At her latest trial, Prosector Ed Connell said: 'The
 decision by her not to disclose previous convictions was deliberate 
because she feared if she did disclose them she would jeopardise her 
chances of being employed by the school.'

She was employed by the school from May 2001 to February 2005, when she was sacked for gross misconduct.

In 2007 she sued Aylesford School for £1.2million for unfair dismissal, claiming racial and sexual discrimination.

Burmis won her case after a 42-day 
hearing, but during the case it emerged she may have had a criminal conviction, an accusation she flatly denied.

Mr Connell said: 'Having
 lied on her application form to Aylesford School she was no doubt aware
 if her previous convictions came to light she would have committed an 
offence.

'In all likelihood she would have been dismissed from her job and prosecuted for that.

'She knew if her lie about her 
background was found out before the tribunal concluded her award damages
 might be significantly reduced,' he added.

'In order to maintain the lie about 
her background and clear the way for future employment she and her 
daughter conspired to pervert the course of justice.'

Sentencing: Samantha Burmis was handed two years behind bars after being found guilty of perverting the course of justice and gaining a pecuniary advantage through deception

In the end she was awarded damages totaling £28,500, although it is not clear if she ever received the money.

In an attempt to distance herself
 from her past, during her tribunal she had offered to have her finger prints taken again and hatched a plan for her daughter Nina Burmis to pose as her.

When a fingerprint expert went to Nina's home in 2009, Nina had answered the door with her face covered and handed over her mother's driving 
licence as proof of identity.

Nina had denied this at the trial, saying: 'I would not pretend to be my 
mother. That is ridiculous. I would not have given my 
mother's licence and covered my face.'

She now admits she lied on oath.

The plan 
unraveled because 24-year-old's prints were already on the 
police file - Nina had herself been convicted of forging a 
cheque to pay for a £3,200 breast enlargement, for which she was handed a
 suspended sentence and unpaid work at Hull Crown Court earlier that year.

She also had previous convictions for shoplifting in 2009, and theft in 2004.

Nina Burmis, of Empire Way, Wembley, was also sentenced today for her part in the scheme.

She was handed18 months imprisonment suspended for two years with supervision and curfew for four months.
