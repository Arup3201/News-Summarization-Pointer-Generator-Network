The stunning identical twins involved in an alleged stabbing row over a man were known as the 'Croatian Kardashians' and were jealous of one another's looks, friends have revealed.

Sara Grkovic, 22, has been arrested and faces an attempted murder charge after she allegedly stabbed sister Dajana because she was believed to be envious of her relationship with a man they both liked. 

Police were called to their home on Saturday night after a violent row which ended when Sara plunged a kitchen knife into her twin sister leaving her critically injured and fighting for life.

The pair would compete with one another to post the most attractive pictures to Facebook, and would even jealously compare their looks with the other, according to friends.

Today, it can also be revealed that the pair were obsessed with the Kardashian family and dreamed of emulating the global success of Kim and her sisters.

In custody: Sara and her sister were alleged to have argued frequently and had a huge row on Saturday, believed to be over a man they both liked

One friend of the two girls, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said: 'I find it incredible that the argument was over a boy, they used to have all the guys here chasing after them and everybody used to call them the Kardashian sisters.

'They seem to have everything, and it's really shocking to hear that Sara apparently stabbed Dajana. I have read the papers saying it was over a boy but the fact is only they know what went on behind the walls of the family home. 

'It's a real shame they couldn't have sorted out whatever the problem was among themselves in a less violent way. 

'I think both of them are quite volatile though, and I have to think about the only person they would ever listen to is the Kardashians. 

'I reckon it would be a good thing to make them friends again and we all hope Dajana will recover soon.'

Obsession: According to friends, the Grkovic sisters were obsessed with the Kardashian family - especially the success of sisters Khloe (left), Kourtney (centre) and Kim (right)  

Police were called to the house that the sisters shared together in the northern Croatian port city of Rijeka after neighbours reported hearing a violent row that ended with Sara plunging a kitchen knife into her twin sister leaving her critically injured.

Medics revealed that Dajana is expected to fully recover but is still in intensive care.

A hospital spokesman said: 'She is slowly recovering but we are not allowing any visitors. Police are also waiting to interview her but she is currently still too ill and they will not be allowed to speak to until she has had further surgery.'

On Tuesday, Sara  made a brief court appearance before judge Ksenia Zorc who said that the young woman would have to stay in jail for another month, and set bail at £10,000.

It's been reported that Sara is claiming that she had only acted in self-defence after he sister tried to strangle her, forcing her to grab a knife off a table.

A police officer told the court that they did find bruising around Sara's throat indicating that somebody had tried to strangle her. 

Friends at the Rijeka Economics University said they were stunned that although they seemed successful and confident, the pair came from a broken home and were living in a tiny one-bedroom flat in the poorest part of town.

Their mother struggled to provide for the family after her husband walked out and they later divorced.

Neighbours believe she is working in Germany as a kitchen assistant and would send money back to her daughters living in the family flat.

Model looks: Sara Grkovic has been charged with stabbing her twin sister. The girls were described by a neighbour as 'peas in a pod' and equally stunning 

Friends said they struggled to make ends meet and would spend any income they had on looking as glamorous as possible, an image which was in complete contrast to their home in the poor Zamet area of Rijeka.

One neighbour told local TV: 'They were apparently arguing about a man that they both liked. He seems to have settled down in a relationship with Dajana and Sara was not happy about it. 

'I never would have thought it would come to her trying to kill her sister though. They were always immaculately groomed and polite, and as alike as two peas in a pod. I never knew which one was passing me in the corridor but they always said hello.' 

She said that she did not often see the two girls together although they lived at the same address, and thought that despite the fact they were identical twins there was an element of jealousy between the two over who was the more attractive.

Attack: The stabbing took place at in the northern Croatian port city of Rijeka

She said: 'Both of them were stunning, I don't think they worried about competition from other women, but they were certainly jealous of each other.'

Dajana is currently in the intensive care ward at the local hospital with a deep wound to her chest and to her thigh. She remains in a stable condition. 

Their father is not in contact with the family, according to family friends.

One told local media: 'They had been a bit wild since their mother went away, and they were left to their own devices. But we never thought it would come to something like this.'
