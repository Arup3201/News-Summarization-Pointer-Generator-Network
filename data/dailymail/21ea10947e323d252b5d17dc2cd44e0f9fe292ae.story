Juventus have reaffirmed their desire to keep hold of Arturo Vidal, stating they'll only listen to offers if the Manchester United target overtly makes it known he wants to leave. 

New boss Massimiliano Allegri revealed he has held talks with the 27-year-old and that he has committed his future to the Serie A club.

But director general Giuseppe Marotta revealed they wouldn't stand in the Chilean's way if he did decide the time was right to move on.

'(Arturo) Vidal? We already said that he is not on the market, but the player's will is decisive,' said Marotta.

'Vidal has never said he wants to leave, and Juventus will sell him only if he were unhappy to remain.

'Nowadays, however, there’s absolutely no reason to even be discussing this now.'
