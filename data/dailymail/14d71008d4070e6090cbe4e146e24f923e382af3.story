The Costa Concordia wreck has become highly lucrative for some locals in Genoa after it was towed into the southern Italy city recently to be scrapped.

Despite previous criticism of those cashing in on the tragic cruise liner by offering rooms and restaurants with a view of the wreck, opportunistic residents are now also offering boat tours around the stricken vessel.

The Concordia has been turned into the latest 'dark tourism' destination, as tourists flock to see it while it waits to be cut up for scrap metal.

Tragedy: 32 were killed when the cruise liner capsized in January 2012 off the island of Giglio in Italy 

The tour boats go within 200 metres of the cruise liner as a guide recounts the story of the tragedy, in which 32 people died after it struck a reef when its captain sailed too close to Giglio Island off Tuscany's coast in January 2012.

The wreck was set upright in September 2013 and it took five days to drag it to Genoa, headquarters of ship owner Costa Crociere S.p.A and the port where the luxury vessel first set sail after construction in 2005.

The tourist offers are unlikely to end any time soon, as the gradual demolition and scrapping will take an estimated two years.

Cashing in: Some locals in the city of Genoa are offering £8 boat tours of the stricken vessel as well as advertising 'rooms with a view' of the wreck

At least one local restaurant has been spotted handing out flyers promising the best views of the stricken liner, and local hostels have also been offering bedrooms with a view. Now tourists can also take guided tours on a mini cruise around the wreck for 10 Euros (8 GBP) a time.

Even Francesco Schettino - dubbed 'Captain Coward' for allegedly abandoning ship while passengers were still on board and who is being tried for manslaughter over the deaths - has been taking advantage of the international attention by offering a lecture to university students on the best emergency practices to use in a disaster situation.

Demolition: It will take two yours to cut up the vessel for scrap metal 

Despite criticism of the advertising campaign from La Vetta restaurant in Genoa, business has been booming with diners wanting to take a view of the ship. On the flyers the restaurant boasted: 'From our terrace you'll catch a great view of the Costa Concordia.'

The ship claimed another life in February this year when one of the rescue divers working to salvage the ship bled to death after cutting his leg on metal in the water, bringing the death toll to 33.
