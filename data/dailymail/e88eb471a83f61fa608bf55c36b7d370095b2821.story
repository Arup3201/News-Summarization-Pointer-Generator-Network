A teen in North Carolina was sent home from school on her last day of high school after school administrators determined that the outfit she was wearing was in violation of the school's dress code regrading skirt length.

Her mother, however, has a plan to stick it to the school for what she and her daughter believe was an unfair punishment for breaking a fairly ambiguous rule.

Violet Burkhart's mother's plan to protest the school's vague dress code: She's going to wear the exact same outfit to her daughter's graduation.

Short: Violet Burkhart was sent home from school for wearing this dress, which administrators deemed too short

'I'm going to wear it in front of everyone and be proud just like she 
should have been able to on her last day... With two hours left in the 
day, Violet says teachers pulled her aside and said her dress was half an
 inch too short,' Burkhart's mother, Amy Redwine, tells WGHP.

The dress code at Central Davidson High School is admittedly vague. According to the school, it doesn't allow 'Shorts, skirts, skorts and dresses shorter than mid-thigh,' noting that 'Mid-thigh is a difficult measure.'

The problem Redwine and her daughter have with the school is not with the dress code, rather with how administrators handled the situation.

'I thought my last day was going to be great and exciting, but they pretty much ruined it for me,' Burkhart told MyFox8.com.

Too short: The principal told Redwine's daughter that the dress (pictured) was too short to wear to school

Her mother is equally upset with how the school handled things.

'I literally looked back at the clock and I’m thinking, it’s 1:00 in the afternoon on her last day of her senior year. My daughter — it’s supposed to be one of her best days and she’s there crying,' Redwine said.

Burkhart says she wore that exact same dress to school at least five times before she was told to go home in the middle of her last day of high school.

Another student at Central Davidson High School says she also had suffered from the school's vague dress code.

'My daughter goes to the same school and she was sent home. Not for the 
length but she was told it enhanced her figure too much. Central 
Davidson high school is a joke,' the mother of another student said.

Pattern: Another mother also complained about the dress code after her daughter was sent home because her outfit 'enhanced her figure too much'

As if the school's dress code wasn't vague enough, a clause in the dress code says 'Principals may elect to enact additional restrictions as deemed appropriate to preserve the educational environment.'

In other words, if a principal doesn't like what a student is wearing, he or she may decide that it's damaging the 'educational environment' and force the student to go home.
