One 94-year-old widow cried tears of joy on Sunday as she was presented with a ring she gave her husband 70 years ago before he died fighting in World War II.

Betty McAleenan of Wyoming was reunited with her high school class ring after it was found in Papua, New Guinea glimmering like a shard of hope beneath the plane wreckage that killed her husband Staff Sgt. Robert Greebull in 1944.

Greebull fought as a bomber gunner in the Wyoming Air National Guard. The cause of the crash has not been reported.

Staff Sgt. Robert Greebull took his wife's ring with him into battle so that he could feel close to her

Robert and his good luck charm made it 
through 38 successful missions but unfortunately he lost his life during
 the 39th. The ring survived.

The ring was discovered amongst the shattered plane in New Guinea 40 years ago, but as of Sunday the forget me not was returned to Greebull's wife who hasn't forgotten her love for him--not at all.

'He was a wonderful, wonderful guy,' Betty McAleenan said to KLTA.

'And I fell madly in love like all people do at that age,' she continued.

The US Naval Research Laboratory is continuing to search for planes unaccounted for in Papua, New Guinea. They are searching in areas that are heavily forested in order to find missing aircraft, reports the New York Daily News.

The Lab led a team of scientists and engineers to use radar technology to find hidden planes.

McAleenan told reporters that finding the box with the ring offers her some closure after years of mourning her husband's tragic death.

'I gave it to him so that we could be together,' she said.

Fox news reports that Robert Greebull once said the ring was the closest thing to being with his wife.

Her family says that they believe the ring has come 'full circle.'

'I gave it to him so that we could be together,' said a tearful McAleenan as she held the ring tightly in her hands
