A bullying boyfriend who bludgeoned his ex-partner to death in front of their 11-month-old daughter when she threatened to leave him was jailed for at least 19 years today.

Jack Wall, 22, beat hairdresser Amelia Arnold, 19, over the head with a dumbbell eight times - just a day after she had tried to report him for domestic violence.

With their baby daughter screaming just metres away, Wall tried to break Miss Arnold’s neck and strangle her - later claiming the horrific act was not as easy as it looked ‘in the movies’.

He snapped during an argument while he
 was moving his things out of their flat, a day after she told him she 
was leaving him for good.

With the help of his uncle, Joe 
Potter, he cleaned the scene to destroy incriminating 
evidence, before rolling her body up in a carpet and dumping it in a 
field.

He handed himself into police three 
days later, but was so high on cannabis that detectives had to wait 
until the following day to interview him.

Judge Aidan Marron QC said Wall used 
‘gross, savage violence’ to kill Miss Arnold, and ordered him to serve 
at least 19 years of a life sentence.

‘You took a dumbbell and hit her with terrifying force, fracturing her skull and causing fatal damage to her brain’, he said.

‘You then went on when you thought she may be alive to apply further violence to finish her off.’

The killer, who had stormed out of the
 dock when he was convicted following a two-week trial on Friday, looked
 on impassively as the sentence was handed down at Blackfriars Crown 
Court.

He had admitted manslaughter, but 
denied murder, claiming he lost control when Miss Arnold threatened to 
call the police during their row.

Following the verdict, her father 
Laurence said: ‘Nothing is going to bring Amelia back to us - we will 
never get over this tragedy.’

Prosecutor Jane Bickerstaff QC said: 
‘This murder took place in the victim’s own home in the presence of her 
and the defendant’s child, who of course is now left parentless.

‘There’s clear evidence that the 
defendant intended to kill, as demonstrated not only by the number and 
ferocity of blows he delivered to the back of the head of the victim.

‘He indicated he thought she was playing dead so he hit her some more and strangled her.

‘When he heard a noise come out of her
 mouth when he folded her up, he himself said he thought she was alive 
and it scared him, so he shoved a sock into her mouth.’

Potter, 41, admitted helping his nephew dispose of the body and trying to stop it ever being discovered.

Clues: Police set up a cordon at Miss Arnold's house to find evidence, but did not discover her body until four days after she disappeared

The court heard he was a career 
criminal, with a string of convictions including for theft, burglary, 
escaping from custody, drug dealing and violence which sate back to 
1987. He had been trying to move away from crime when he helped Wall. 

Judge Marron said: 'I accept without 
any reservation at all that whenever you came out from home in the 
Milton Keynes area to Stevenage, you had no idea of the task which 
awaited you.'

He said Potter had done his best to redeem himself by helping police, but added a prison term was inevitable.

Potter was jailed for two and a half 
years concurrently on both offences of perverting the course of justice 
and obstructing a coroner.

The murder took place at Ms Arnold’s rented home in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, on November 8 last year.

The teenage mother had previously 
complained to her mother and a GP about Hall’s abuse, and the day before
 her death met a domestic violence officer at Hatfield Police Station - 
but made no formal complaint.

Giving evidence her mother, Amanda 
Joy, said her daughter, regularly complained of Wall’s behaviour in the 
weeks before the murder.

‘Once Amanda started to go out with 
Jack Wall, her personality seemed to chance and she became moodier, 
argumentative, aggressive, and confrontational’, she said.

'When she came to me, all she moaned about and all she complained about was Jack.'

But she added the teenager ‘wanted to keep giving him one more chance’ despite the violence.

Her body was discovered in Hatfield 
Woods, Hertfordshire on November 11, while a blood-stained carpet was 
found in Hollybush Lane, Welwyn Garden City.

The shallow grave was coated in disinfectant to deter animals from digging up the corpse.

Both Potter and Wall also admitted obstructing a coroner.

Wall was jailed for life with a 
minimum sentence of 19 years for murder, and a concurrent sentence of 
four and a half years for obstructing a coroner.

Potter was jailed for two and a half years concurrently for perverting the course of justice and obstructing a coroner.
