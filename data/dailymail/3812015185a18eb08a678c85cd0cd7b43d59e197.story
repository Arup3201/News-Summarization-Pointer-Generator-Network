A Nashville fencing coach ended foiling a robbery after chasing down the thieves with his sword.

Franco Scaramuzza said he was pulling into a shopping center when he saw two men use pepper spray against a couple and steal a purse.

He jumped out of his car wearing his fencing outfit, grabbed his sword, and began to charge towards the suspects.

On guard: Franco Scaramuzza had stopped to go shopping when he saw the robbers attacking a couple. He was already dressed in his fencing gear so he gave chase

'The first thing that went through my head is somebody should do something, and I didnâ€™t want to be a hypocrite who just tweeted about it,' Mr. Scaramuzza told WSMV-TV.

The good Samaritan said he's been training his whole life for moments just like this. And, as a fencing coach, he knows how to intimidate.

'I charged towards them, holding my epee up high, yelling at them,' he told the station. 'I kept yelling throughout the entire thing. They completely panicked and dropped everything they stole and really took off.'

Michael Butt and Zachary Johnson were picked up by police and charged with robbery.

Looking the part: Mr Scaramuzza was literally dressed to do battle as he was wearing his fencing kit as he chased after the robbers

They remain in custody on $50,000 bond each.

Mr Scaramuzza said he won this bout using the same lessons he teaches in fencing class.

'You have to overcome your own fears,' he said.

And it only takes a split second to switch from defense to offense.

'You have to make decisions in a very quick amount of time,' Mr Scaramuzza told Channel 4 News.

'Fencing, you can do it without the weapon. It happens in your mind, and that's how you try to make the right choices.
