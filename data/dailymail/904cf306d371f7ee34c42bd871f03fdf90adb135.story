Former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych is wanted for ‘mass murder’ and is believed to have evaded security forces by fleeing the country in a helicopter during a three-day dash for freedom.

While further evidence of his corrupt behaviour continues to surface from the incriminating documents found at his mansion, there have been a number of unconfirmed sightings.

The most recent put him in Crimea – the only part of Ukraine where Russians make up the majority of the population – sparking extraordinary claims he was assisted out of the country by his neighbouring people.

The three-day chase began on Friday after the then-President signed an accord with the opposition brokered by diplomats from Russia, France, Poland and Germany to end the street battles in Kiev that left more than 80 people dead.

By the time that thousands of police and paramilitary special forces pulled out of the capital, Yanukovych may already have fled.

CCTV footage captured what appears to be the deposed leader wheeling a suitcase into a helicopter and fleeing like a terrorist on the run.

He is believed to have left his residence outside Kiev, where Ukrainians have discovered a private zoo, mock galleon and a number of vintage cars that their taxes and the corruption he presided over helped to fund.

Yanukovych was accompanied by his chief of staff Andrei Klyuyev, one of the men blamed by demonstrators for brutality against civilians during three months of protests, and were heading to Donetsk airport.

Acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, who has been leading the hunt for the elusive statesman, wrote on Facebook that the former president was unsuccessful in leaving the country.

‘He and his security disembarked the helicopters and boarded two private Falcon-type aircraft. He tried to fly out [of the country],’ Mr Avakov wrote.

‘The border service prevented their take-off.’

Yanukovych then allegedly went to a state residence in Donetsk, before leaving for Crimea late on Saturday night.

Reports later surfaced that two of his closest allies, Viktor Pshonka, the prosecutor general, and Oleksandr Klimenko, the tax minister, escaped at the same airport, but only after a shootout between their bodyguards and border guards.

‘Having learnt about parliament’s decisions to appoint A V Turchynov as acting Ukrainian President...Yanukovych hurriedly left the private sanatorium for Belbek airport [outside Sevastopol],’ Mr Avakov’s Facebook post continued.

‘Yanukovych, without reaching Belbek airport, stopped at a private residence near Balaclava. He gathered his guards and asked who would continue accompanying him and who would stay here.

‘Some of the staff of the state guard directorate expressed their wish to stay here. Having said goodbye to them, Yanukovych passed an official document declining state guards.

‘With the remaining security personnel, Yanukovych, accompanied by A P Klyuyev, left in an unknown direction in three cars, having switched off all means of communication.

‘I inform you as of this morning. A criminal case has been instituted on mass murder of peaceful citizens. Yanukovych and a number of other officials HAVE BEEN PUT ON THE WANTED LIST.’

There was mounting speculation that Yanukovych had already made his way to Russia, on a private yacht from Balaclava, or with the Russian Navy from Sevastopol.

Back in Kiev, barricades of old furniture and car tyres remained in place on Independent Square, with smoke rising from camp fires among tents occupied by diehards vowing to stay until elections in May.

The mood among the few hundred on the square was a mixture of fatigue, sorrow for the 82 people killed last week, and a sense of victory after three months of protests.

A large video screen by the side of the stage was showing the faces of the dead, one after another, on a loop.

But the carnage over the past week is only the start of the country’s problem, with Ukraine’s Finance Ministry revealing the nation urgently needs $35 billion in foreign aid.

Acting President Oleksander Turchinov, appointed after Yanukovich was stripped of his powers by parliament on Saturday, said Ukraine was near default and the economy was falling into an abyss.

'Over the past two days, we have had consultations and meetings with the EU and U.S. ambassadors and other countries and financial institutions on the urgent delivery of macro-financial assistance for Ukraine,' Acting Finance Minister Yuri Kolobov said in a statement.
