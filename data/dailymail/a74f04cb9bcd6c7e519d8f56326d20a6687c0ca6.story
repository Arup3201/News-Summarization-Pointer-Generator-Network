A hospital has sparked outrage after banning overweight patients from using beds on an emergency ward.

Those weighing over 15 stone are not permitted to use the beds at Dr Gray's Hospital in Elgin, north east Scotland, after fire experts insisted the evacuation system was a danger for overweight patients.

Campaigners have slammed the restriction
 as 'completely unacceptable' and denying patients their rights - but 
the hospital has insisted it must remain.

The ban has been imposed by Dr Gray's Hospital in Elgin, Scotland, after fire experts insisted the evacuation system was a danger for overweight patients

Hospital bosses imposed the order after meeting with Grampian Fire and Rescue Service.

Margaret Watt, chairperson of Scotland Patients' Association said: 'I've never heard anything like this before and it is totally unacceptable.

'The ban is actually against the patients' human rights and civil liberties and they can quite easily launch legal action if it means their treatment is hampered.'

The section affected is the former ward 10, which was closed last 
year for refurbishment but has re-opened as an Acute Medical Assessment 
Unit.

Ms Watt added: 'I understand the fire brigade's danger assessment, but I feel the hospital should have had a plan that catered for patients of all shapes and sizes before doing this work.

'We've known for a long time that many people are overweight, that's not happened overnight, so the hospital should be clever enough to cater for everyone in all areas.

'I wouldn't even say 15 stone is a particularly obese weight, and therefore I would worry for the safety of all patients, regardless of their size.

'Surely a 15 stone person wouldn't be a hazard? I'd like to hear how they came up with the weight ban.'

The news comes just a week after a senior nurse at Dr Gray's spoke out about suspected stroke victims and patients with heart problems passing out in chairs because of a severe shortage of beds.

The affected ward, which had 15 beds, closed in August last year after it was deemed unsuitable for modern health care needs.

But the area has been reopened after NHS Grampian admitted it has been tough to find beds for everyone since.

An NHS Grampian spokeswoman defended the restrictions on people weighing over 15 stone.

She said: 'The former ward 10 at Dr Gray's is currently the temporary home of the Acute Medical Assessment Unit and the Rehab unit."When the reconfiguration work at the hospital is complete, these services will move out of this area and into refurbished accommodation.

'The reconfiguration project is aimed at moving - once and for all - all in-patient accommodation out of the oldest parts of the building, which are no longer in line with modern health care needs.

'However, to allow this project to go ahead, we need to use the former ward 10, on a temporary basis, as a turning space.

'There is no other suitable accommodation available at Dr Gray's. We worked very closely with Grampian Fire and Rescue Service prior to this move, staging a worst case scenario simulated evacuation.

'This was observed throughout by Grampian Fire and Rescue Service. They asked us to introduce a 15 stone limit on patients and we agreed.

'Once the reconfiguration work is complete, the former ward 10 and associated areas will be used for a range of day case work, including chemotherapy.

'This work represents a Â£3million investment in Dr Gray's by NHS Grampian and will result in a vastly improved environment for patients and staff.

'As has been acknowledged, the hospital is very busy at the moment. We are incredibly grateful for the hard work of our staff and the understanding of our patients.'
