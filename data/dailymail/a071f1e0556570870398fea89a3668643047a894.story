A lawyer accused of planting drugs in the car of a volunteer at her son's school had previously written a book about committing the 'perfect crime', it has emerged.

Jill Easter, who is accused along with her husband of conspiring against PTA president Kelli Peters, wrote the novel Holding House under the pen name of Ava Bjork, and it was published last year.

Easter, an attorney-turned-novelist, created a promotional video for her book which was uploaded to YouTube. It asks readers: 'If you knew how to commit the perfect crime, would you do it?'

Charged: Irvine police said that Kent Wycliffe Easter, 38, right, and Jill Bjorkholm Easter, 38, left, conspired to frame Kelli Peters by putting Vicodin, Percocet, marijuana and a used marijuana pipe in her car

Victim: The duo sought revenge on Mrs Peters, pictured, because they believed the woman wasn't properly supervising their son, according to police, and resorted to extreme measures to get her fired - and imprisoned

It is alleged that Easter and her husband, Kent, conspired to frame Kelli 
Peters by putting Vicodin, Percocet, marijuana and a used marijuana pipe
behind the front seat of her car.

The couple, both lawyers, were 
charged Tuesday with conspiracy to procure false arrest, false 
imprisonment and conspiracy to falsely report a crime.

Mrs Peters is a well-known school 
volunteer and the PTA president at Plaza Vista School. Prosecutors say 
the Easters disliked Peters because they felt she didn't properly 
supervise their son.

According to the Los Angeles Times,
the promotional trailer for Jill Easter's novel says the crime is 
simple, possible and 'no one will get hurt and there's no way they can 
get caught'.

The characters later become the 
subject of a manhunt because 'unforeseen events cause their dream crime 
to unravel into a nightmare'.

The current allegations aren't the first time the couple had a run in with Peters.

They sued Peters in March 2010 after 
she locked their son, then a first-grader, out of the school for less 
than 20 minutes. The case was dismissed.

Out: Police said that on February 16, 2011, the Easters enacted a plan to get rid of Mrs Peters, who was the Parent Teacher's Association president at the Plaza Vista Elementary School, pictured

Facing charges: Kent and Jill Easter could be jailed for three years if they are convicted on all charges

Feud: At one point, Jill Easter (pictured) requested a restraining order against Mrs Peters, claiming she was psychotic and unstable

The couple were thought to be seeking revenge on Mrs Peters because of a longstanding feud over 
their son, according to police, and resorted to extreme measures to get 
her fired - and imprisoned.

At one point, Jill Easter requested a restraining order against Mrs Peters, claiming she was psychotic and unstable.

She alleged the school volunteer was harassing her son and had even
threatened to kill her. She claimed that Ms Peters 'will stop at 
nothing to silence my son' and had been calling him psychotic and 
unstable to other parents.

'She is stalking me and attempting to intimidate me at my son's school and while I run errands in Irvine,' she alleged.

The request for a restraining order was denied.

The Easters are scheduled to be arraigned July 17. If convicted on all charges, they would face up to three years in prison.
