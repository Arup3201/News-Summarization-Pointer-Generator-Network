set up by South Staffordshire and Shropshire Healthcare NHS Foundation 
Trust following the attack.

Injuries: Letty Ferguson suffered a broken upper arm and needed six weeks of treatment after she was attacked by a fellow hospital patient

Mrs Ferguson was admitted to the hospital after becoming depressed and suffering vascular dementia.

Her daughter Jackie Hathaway said: 'I just don’t want it to happen to anybody else. It has been so traumatic.

'I have been shocked because you can’t believe that this sort of thing could happen in this day and age.'

Mrs Hathaway and her husband Trevor, both 69, from Burton, Staffordshire, were the mayor and mayoress of East Staffordshire between 2005 and 2006.

They said they want to highlight the lack of dedicated facilities in East Staffordshire to help people with mental health issues since Burton’s Margaret Stanhope centre, which offered inpatient psychiatric services, closed last year.

Mrs Hathaway said her mother became depressed during the summer while living at a care facility in Burton.

Following visits from mental health 
specialists and the crisis team, it was decided Mrs Ferguson, who 
volunteered at Burton’s Queen’s Hospital into her 90s and also worked as
a teacher, needed in-patient care.

She was moved to the Baswich ward at St George's Hospital after attempts to find provision in Tamworth failed.

Mrs Hathaway said: 'Since the closure of the Margaret Stanhope centre there’s no inpatient care in Burton.

'People need to know there’s nowhere within a 30-mile radius if they have a mental health problem.'

Mrs Hathaway said the South Staffordshire and Shropshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, had not apologised.

Mrs Ferguson is now staying in a care home in Burton.

A spokesman for the trust said it was taking the attack 'very seriously' and had been in regular contact with the family.

The spokesman a serious incident review had been set up and the family would be able to raise any issues.

Dr Neil Brimblecombe, director of nursing for the trust, said any recommendations from the report would be learned.

A Staffordshire Police spokesman said: 'We received a report on Saturday, July 20, concerning issues between patients on a hospital ward.

'Inquiries were carried out and we were satisfied there were no grounds for a criminal investigation.

'The matter was to be dealt with by the relevant agencies and the families of those involved were fully updated.'
