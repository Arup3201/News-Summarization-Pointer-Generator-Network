Fans of the controversial Benefits Street television series are flocking to the run-down Birmingham road where it is filmed to take souvenir photographs of the street and its residents.

James Turner Street, home to the show's controversial characters White Dee, Black Dee and Mark and Becky, has become an unlikely visitor destination as the five-part show, which ends tonight, has gripped viewers.

Dozens of fans have descended on the terraced street, portrayed as being home to thieves, benefits cheats and the unemployed in the Channel 4 series.

Benefits Street is filmed in James Turner Street in Birmingham and is an unlikely new tourist attraction

Jobless single mother White Dee, 42, has emerged as one of the stars of the show and now signs autographs

Residents Mark Thomas and Becky Howe, both 23, have admitted fiddling their benefits and do not work

Viewers arrive in cars and on foot to pose beside the street sign or outside the homes of the show's more notorious characters.

Others wait outside the house of White Dee, the 42-year-old mother of two also known as Deirdre Kelly, who has been inundated with media offers since first appearing on Benefits Street.

White Dee, so-called to distinguish her from Black Dee, who also lives on the street, is a jobless single mother who was dubbed the 'patron saint of drug users and drop-outs' when she debated on television with entrepreneur Katie Hopkins.

She has welcomed tourists into her house for a cup of tea and a photograph, as have argumentative couple, benefits cheats Mark Thomas and Becky Howe.

The jobless couple, both 23, live in the street with their children Callum, four, and Casey, two, and survive on state handouts of £750 a month.  They both admit to having fiddled their benefits payments, and are now trying to raise money by selling their autographs on eBay.

Not all of the tourists are fans, though, and residents have complained of people shouting abuse and defacing the street signs with slogans criticising those who live there.

But while some of the programme's stars have been happy to pose for photographs or give out autographs, some of the others living in the street, where a two-up, two-down house costs £78,000 but 90 per cent of the residents are on benefits, are fed up with their portrayal on television.

One said he was longing for it to 'get back to normal', while other residents are angry at what they see as a misrepresentation of their street which is home to those with jobs and careers as well as those without.

Today a Christian charity that owns a
 primary school on James Turner Street said it was planning to complain 
that the local childrens' education was being jeopardised by 
'rubberneckers' blocking the roads and hurling abuse at residents.

Steve
 Chalke, of the Oasis Academy Foundry, said he was going to complain to 
Ofcom - which has received nearly 1,000 complaints about the show - 
about the disruption caused to school staff and pupils.

Last month, producers of the show were accused of bribing the street's residents to be filmed for Benefits Street.

Residents of James Turner Street, who were not paid because it might affects their benefits claims, said they were offered alcohol and fast food by television producers who wanted to get the best possible footage.

Miss Howe said: 'The film crew effectively invaded our street and were at people’s doors every morning.

'If you didn’t want to do any filming they’d go away and come back five minutes later carrying LSV energy drinks and cigarettes.

'I know for a fact that one resident who is in the show was bought cans of beer every day from the shop and was filmed drinking from it.

'Producers bought us McDonald’s meals and we were even photographed by the Google Street View car eating it outside our house.'

Channel 4 refuted the allegations and said their staff were only 'helping out' by giving residents food and drink.

Benefits Street had viewers gripped from the start after its first episode featured people admitting fiddling benefits payments, shoplifting, and avoiding work because they couldn't be bothered.

One resident of James Turner Street, an alcoholic known as Fungi, was shown selling fake Big Issue magazines and drinking.  He has not been back to the street since the first episode was screened.

Another resident, Black Dee (aka Samora Roberts), 32, is due to appear in court later this week to answer drugs charges.

Tonight more than 5million people are expected to tune in at 9pm for the final episode of the show.
