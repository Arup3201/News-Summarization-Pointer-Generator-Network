Britain’s worst mass poisoning of modern times may have left six children from one family with lifelong disabilities.

The Matta family live near Camelford, North Cornwall, where a huge quantity of aluminium sulphate poisoned the water supply 26 years ago.

And of the seven children in the family, six have disabilities.

Last month, a Mail on Sunday special report revealed that three deaths have been linked to the incident.

And now, Christopher Exley, a professor in bioinorganic chemistry at Keele University, who has investigated the deaths, has been contacted by Sarah Matta and her husband Paul who believe their family has been blighted by the poisoning.

The incident happened in July 1988 when a relief tanker driver accidentally dumped 20 tons of aluminium sulphate – a chemical used to keep drinking water clear – directly into the water supply instead of into a storage tank at Camelford’s Lowermoor water treatment works.

As a ten-year-old, Sarah unwittingly drank the heavily contaminated water.

The eldest of the couple’s children, Sophie, 11, was born 15 years after the event.

The youngest affected child, Louie, is two.

For years the couple have  struggled to understand why their children – two of whom use wheelchairs – have problems including delayed development, anxiety issues, speech problems and possible autism.

In 2012, a blood test found that Mrs Matta had aluminium levels in her blood 20 times higher than normal.

Professor Exley said: ‘Could that impact on her children? It could.

‘Aluminium is toxic. Studies in  animals show that if you feed  mothers aluminium in the water supply, the offspring will exhibit developmental problems.’

He fears hundreds of children born 
since 1988 to the 20,000 people estimated to have drunk the contaminated
 water could also be at risk.

He
 said: ‘Everybody wants to know if there are people who were affected at
 the time who still have higher than normal levels of aluminium  in 
their bodies.

'If they have had children since then, there’s a chance those children have been affected as well.’

Mrs
 Matta, 36, has not visited Camelford since 1998 – even though she lives
 just a short drive away in Bodmin. She said: ‘I have nothing against 
the people, but it holds so many unhappy memories for me.’

Six
 of her children – Sophie, 11; Katie, ten; Olivia, eight; Luke, six; 
Harry, four; and Louie, two – have a condition called Ehlers-Danlos 
Syndrome (EDS).

The type they have means their joints bend too much and can dislocate with ease. They also suffer fatigue and joint pain.

The couple’s youngest child, D’arcy, who was born in February, is too young to be assessed. Mrs Matta said they were speaking out so  others did not ‘suffer in silence’.

Prof Exley said: ‘If you look at these cases, it starts to look like Camelford has produced a number of incredible one-offs.

‘The situation with the Matta  family fits that pattern quite well.’
