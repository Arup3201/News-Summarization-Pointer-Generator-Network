Ariel detergent has sparked outrage in Germany after placing a neo-Nazi code on a new line of promotional packages.

The boxes feature a white football shirt with a large number '88' - which far-right extremists use as a code for 'Heil Hitler' to skirt the country's ban on Nazi slogans.

The number was intended to show how many loads of laundry buyers would be able to do with one package.

Controversy: '88' is used by neo-Nazis to represent 'Heil Hitler' as Germany has a ban on Nazi slogans

However, it is common knowledge in 
Germany that neo-Nazis have given the number a new meaning. The symbol 
derives from that fact that 'H' is the eighth letter of the alphabet.

The
 brand's parent company, Procter & Gamble, has issued an apology for
 'any false connotations' after shoppers took to Twitter posting 
pictures of the offending powder.

The firm yesterday acknowledged that the number was 'unintentionally ambiguous.'

Ariel 18 liquid detergent has also been pulled from German shelves as '18' represents 'AH', or 'Adolf Hitler'

'We very much regret if there are any false associations and distance ourselves clearly from any far-right ideology,' company spokeswoman Gabi Hassig said in a statement.

Haessig said the company has stopped shipping the offending powder.

They have also pulled a liquid detergent that was being promoted as 'Ariel 18' - which represents 'AH', as in Adolf Hitler.
