A heavily pregnant woman has revealed how she was rescued from an icy Atlanta interstate by a good Samaritan after being stranded there for 12 hours.

Due to the chaos on the roads after the winter storm, eight-months-pregnant Katie Norman Horne and her three-year-old son had been sitting in their unmoving car all Tuesday evening, with no water and only a box of Tic-Tacs to eat.

Finally their luck changed when 25-year-old Craig Catalfu - who had been alerted to their situation thanks to a Facebook group called SnowedOutAtlanta - arrived in his all-wheel-drive truck to rescue them.

Relief: Eight-months-pregnant Katie Norman Horne (right, with husband Kevin) had been in her car on an icy Atlanta interstate for 12 hours when she was finally rescued by a good Samaritan thanks to a Facebook group

Desperate times: She and her three-year-old son had no water and only a box of Tic-Tacs to eat when 25-year-old Craig Catalfu arrived in his all-wheel-drive truck to assist them

Mr Catalfu had written a post on the group offering assistance to anyone affected by the snowy conditions in the Smyrna, Georgia, area when one of the members responded: 'Craig pregnant woman at child at 285/75 [sic]'.

When he arrived at the scene, he told Today.com that he witnessed the 'utter chaos' of the car-packed street, which he said resembled a 'parking lot'.

He then assisted 33-year-old Mrs Horne - who had been nervous to drive while pregnant in unfamiliar conditions - by having her follow his car in hers, slowly guiding her through the turmoil and back to her home in Marietta.

The whole ordeal, from when Mr Catalfu arrived at Mrs Horne's car to when they got back to her house, took three hours of driving at a cautious ten miles an hour.

A very grateful Mrs Horne, who works as a human resources consultant, said that she was surprised at how determined Mr Catalfu was to seek her out

'Quite honestly, I'm pleasantly shocked by the kindness and goodness of strangers,' she said.

'I had never met Craig or any of these people who kept posting messages saying they were praying for me.'

What's more, Mr Catalfu's timing couldn't have been better; once Mrs Horne got home to her husband Kevin, she began having Braxton Hicks contractions, which are a sign of dehydration.

The SOS Facebook group was started by
 Atlanta resident Michelle Sollicito after she noticed some friends 
posting online about needing help and others offering help.

'None of them had been matched up,' she explained. 'I created the group and it just snowballed, forgive the pun.'

The group has been a savior for locals affected by the wet winter storm that hit much of the South on Tuesday, with temperatures dropping to the teens.

The rare snowfall - which resulted in about two to three inches of snow - prompted thousands of flights to be cancelled and caused dozens of accidents on the roads, which were packed with commuters all trying to leave the city at once.

As many as 15,000 schoolchildren across the South either slept on the buses that tried and failed to get them home, or on cots in school gymnasiums.

All students made it home by Wednesday evening, officials said.
