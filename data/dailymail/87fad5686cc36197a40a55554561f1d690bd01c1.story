Pep Guardiola insists Bayern Munich have not practised penalties ahead of Wednesday night's return leg against Manchester United.

The Champions League last-eight tie is finely poised at 1-1 after Bastian Schweinsteiger cancelled out Nemanja Vidic's header at Old Trafford last week. A repeat result at the Allianz Arena would see the tie head to penalties.

But on the topic of spot-kicks, Guardiola, who was speaking at his pre-match press conference, claimed his side had not prepared for such a scenario.

'It's less about technique and more about courage. It's all in the head,' said Guardiola.

The Bayern Munich manager, who was saw his team's 53-game unbeaten run in the Bundesliga come to an end on Saturday after a 1-0 defeat at Augsburg, expects United to player on the break.

'I think United will be again waiting for us at the back. They will be waiting deep, deep in their own half,' Guardiola said.

'English teams defend and then wait for the quick break. David Moyes also has eight, nine players at the back. They are waiting for mistakes, set pieces and breaks.

'That is why we have to be disciplined. We are playing at home and that is important and we know exactly what to do to attack well.'

Guardiola was in no doubt that Rooney, who is struggling with a foot injury, would line up for United on Wednesday night.

On the attack: Guardiola was complimentary of Rooney describing him as one of the best player's he's seen

Rooney missed his side's 4-0 win over Newcastle at the weekend after it emerged that he may have chipped a bone in his foot.

But
 speaking about the England sriker, who trained with the United squad on
 Tuesday morning, Guardiola said: 'Rooney is going to play, 100 per 
cent. He is going to play, I bet you a big big glass of beer.'

Guardiola described Rooney as 'a big player, one of the best I have seen in my career.'

The Bayern boss brushed aside their first league defeat after 53 games on, saying he was not after records. But
 after the draw in Manchester and another draw against Hoffenheim it is 
the first time since 2011 that Bayern, who clinched the Bundesliga title
 in record time last month, have gone three straight games without a 
win.

Raring to go: Guardiola expects Manchester United to play on the break in Wednesday's clash

'I knew that we would 
lose eventually,' said Guardiola, who had fielded a below-strength team 
against Augsburg to rest key players.

'The
 team knows how important the Champions League is. Obviously we still 
have to play the last few Bundesliga games but our targets are now 
different ones.'

Bayern will
 be without two key midfielders, with Schweinsteiger suspended 
following his red card in the first leg and Thiago Alcantara injured, 
leaving Toni Kroos and possibly right back Philipp Lahm to occupy those 
positions.

'Philipp can play
 everywhere. We are missing many players and he has shown that he can 
play that position.' Guardiola said. 'We know what we have to do and we 
will apply it. It is little details that will decide the outcome.'
