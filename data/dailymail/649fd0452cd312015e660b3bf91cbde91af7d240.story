Party goers in Brisbane got the shock of their lives after they challenged a group of 'bored' looking police officers to a dance off and they actually accepted. 

The Brisbane CBD may have been the location of all things serious with the G20 coming to town on the weekend but a team of seven police officers effectively lightened the mood a little.

The Courier Mail reported that just after midnight on Sunday morning, day two of the G20 leaders' summit, Tina Turner's infectious 'Nutbush City Limits' came blasting from pub 'Irish Murphy's' on the corner of George and Elizabeth streets, just outside a restricted security zone.

Brisbane couple David and Leah License decided that before they went home they'd break out in the 'nutbush' dance moves right there on the footpath. 

Then in spectacular fashion, the group of officers across the street from them, then busted out their own moves with onlookers cheering and laughing at the site. 

On completion of their show of skills, everyone in the street applauded loudly. 

'We couldn’t believe it, all the police did it, it was just hilarious, it was such a good night,' Leah Licence told The Courier Mail.

Not wanting to miss the moment, Mr License took a video of the funny interaction and said he was delighted to see that the officers were out there having a good time, despite being on duty.

Dance anyone? These Brisbane police officers obviously like the Tina Turner song 'nutbush'

'They were looking pretty bored where they were standing, doing their job of course, but I think by about midnight the leaders were all tucked up in bed,' Mr Licence told The Courier Mail. 

With a group of friends the couple said they had walked from South Bank to across the city passing a number of police stationed a various points for the G20. 

Hearing reports through media that the CBD was like a ghost town they decided to go out and have some fun, getting a little more than they bargained for. 

Acting Sergeant Brendon Winslow said it's a fine balance at major events like the G20.

'First and foremost the role of officers during the G20 was to be ambassadors for the Service and for Australia while ensuring the safety and security of the G20 Leaders’ Summit,' he said in a statement.

'The Queensland Police Service fully supports these officers and we believe we got this balance right.'
