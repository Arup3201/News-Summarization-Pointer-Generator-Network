Extreme hot weather in Perth has sent the internet into meltdown.

Thousands of iiNet customers across Australia have found themselves offline after the company shut down some of its systems at its Perth data centre because of record breaking-temperatures.

'Due to record breaking temperatures, iiNet Toolbox, Email and our corporate websites are unavailable. Apologies for any inconvenience caused,' iiNet tweeted.

Users in Western Australia, NSW, Victoria and South Australia took to Twitter and Facebook to post their frustrations to the country's second largest internet service provider.

Monday was Perth's sixth hottest day on record, reaching 44.4C just before 2pm.

It was also the city's hottest January day since 31, 1991.

The weather hampered the Transperth network, which ordered trains on all lines to drop their speed by about 20km/h.

Speed restrictions are imposed on train drivers every summer when temperatures reach 39C.

Walk trails at Yanchep National Park were also closed because of the high fire danger rating forecast by the Bureau of Meteorology.

With hot weather forecast for the rest of the week, people are being encouraged to take precautions to avoid heat stress.

State health coordinator Gail Milner said some people were particularly vulnerable in hot temperatures including the elderly, young children and babies.

Ms Milner said people should ensure they have ample supplies of non-alcoholic cool drinks and good sun protection.
