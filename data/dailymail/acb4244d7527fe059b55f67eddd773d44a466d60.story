Nick Clegg is being urged by colleagues to forego his usual holiday in Spain and volunteer for a ‘summer of pain’ doing ordinary jobs outside Westminster.

With the Liberal Democrats fearing wipeout at next year’s general election, and the Deputy Prime Minister’s personal ratings through the floor, senior party figures are drawing up a radical plan for him to reconnect with ‘real people’.

It is based on former leader Paddy Ashdown’s decision in 1993 to spend several months outside the ‘Westminster bubble’, which was credited with boosting his popularity.

Lord Ashdown set off to ‘see for himself what was going on in Britain’. He travelled from Cornwall to Orkney, spending time on housing estates, in schools and factories, and meeting policemen, miners, dustmen and fishermen.

He did stints working underground at a colliery in Scotland and at a gay nightclub in Oxford.

He repeated the exercise in 1998, working on hospital wards and in police stations, usually sleeping in the spare rooms of families he visited on estates during the day.

Senior party figures want Mr Clegg to use this summer to embark on a similar tour of Britain in an attempt to counter the impression that he has become too comfortable with the trappings of political office. 

‘Nick needs to do what Paddy did. He should use the summer to get out and about meeting ordinary folk and listening to their concerns,’ said one.

It is not clear whether the Deputy Prime Minister, who is fiercely protective of his holiday time with his wife and three sons, will agree to the plan.

He summers every year in Olmedo, a small town in northern Spain, where his lawyer wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez was born and where the couple were married.

A poll this week showed the beleaguered Mr Clegg suffered another sharp drop in his personal popularity between May and June.

The Guardian/ICM survey showed his  satisfaction ratings fell 16 points this month to -37 – Mr Clegg’s lowest rating since he became Deputy Prime Minister.
