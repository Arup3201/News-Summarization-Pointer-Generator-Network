A woman claims her dreams of motherhood have been ruined after she got food poisoning from a rotisserie chicken bought at Tesco.

Lisa Fessey, 41, and her husband were overjoyed when doctors successfully transferred two embryos into her womb.

But two days later she became severely ill after developing food poisoning caused by the chicken bought from Tesco.

Days later, she was told the fertility procedure had failed.

'Heartbroken': Lisa Fessey claims her dreams of motherhood have been ruined after she got food poisoning from chicken bought at Tesco

Mrs Fessey, a travel agent, and her husband believe the campylobacter gastroenteretis caused by eating the rotisserie chicken was responsible for her failure to become pregnant.

And they fear that after having now used both her IVF cycles available free on the NHS they have lost their last chance to start a family because they can’t afford to pay for private fertility treatment.

The couple had been hopeful of success after their fertilised eggs were transferred successfully to her womb in June 2012, as the previous cycle of IVF had resulted in Mrs Fessey becoming pregnant, though she later miscarried.

Mrs Fessey began to feel unwell after eating the chicken on July 2, bought from Tesco’s store at Wombwell, near Barnsley, two days after the IVF treatment.

Soon after, she suffered severe diarrhoea.

A couple of days later her GP sent her to Barnsley District General Hospital where she was placed on a drip for two nights. Days later she was told she had lost the embryos.

Dashed hopes: Mrs Fessey, 41, was overjoyed when doctors successfully transferred two embryos into her womb. But two days later she became severely ill after developing food poisoning caused by the chicken bought from Tesco

After contacting London law firm Slater & Gordon Mrs Fessey issued a civil claim against Tesco.

The supermarket admitted liability in relation to the food poisoning last summer but has not admitted that this resulted in the loss of the embryos. The couple are now pursuing a compensation claim.

'It is just devastating for us,' said Mrs Fessey, from Barnsley. 'We had suffered years of heartache and frustration and believed we would finally be able to start a family of our own.

'It was such a crushing blow for us, as realistically it was our last chance.

'We are no longer entitled to IVF on the NHS and we cannot afford to pay for it privately, so we hoped Tesco would help - but they turned us down.

'When they told me the embryos had failed I was heartbroken, I knew it was my last chance as we simply cannot afford to do it privately and at 41,  my chance of success are plummeting every day.'

An environmental health officer from 
Barnsley Council visited the chicken counter at the Tesco store in 
Wombwell and noted a number of potential health concerns including poor 
handling of raw chicken and insufficient cleaning practices of 
preparation surfaces.

Once
 she knew the cause of her illness, Mrs Fessey decided to write to Tesco
 and in the hope that the supermarket giant would cover the cost of a 
new cycle of IVF.

Despair: Days after suffering food poisoning, she was told the fertility procedure had failed

Mrs 
Fessey said: Lisa said: 'There is no way we can afford the £3,000 to 
have another round of IVF so I hope that Tesco will do the decent thing 
and pay for it for us.

'Time is not on our side so I hope something can be resolved as soon as possible before our dreams of having a family have gone for good.'

But Dr David Ogutu, a consultant gynaecologist in the NHS and at the Herts and Essex Fertility Centre, said it is unlikely the food poisoning affected the success of Mrs Fessey's IVF.

He told MailOnline: 'It is impossible to prove what effect the food poisoning had. But it is very unlikely to have affected it, in my opinion.

'The vast majority of women at her age who have embryos put back in would have a negative pregnancy test.

'At 41, there is only about a 20-25 per 
cent chance she would have a positive pregnancy test - and a 15 to 20 
per cent chance of taking home a baby.

Claim: Mrs Fessey is now hoping Tesco will fund another round of IVF, as she has used up her allowance on the NHS. But doctors have warned her age is against her

'As a woman ages, there is a higher chance of the embyros being abnormal and not implanting.'

Jane Cooper, personal injury lawyer at Slater & Gordon, who is representing Lisa, said: 'This has been a harrowing experience for Mrs Fessey and her partner.

'Their expectations of a pregnancy running to full term were cruelly destroyed by Tesco’s simple failure to follow straightforward food hygiene requirements. 

'They can take some comfort though from Tesco’s final acceptance of their wrongdoing and we are now focused on getting them the best compensation settlement to allow them a chance of fulfilling their dream of having a child.'

A spokesperson for Tesco said: 'Providing safe food is our absolute priority, and we have thorough cleaning routines to maintain the highest standards in our stores.

'We listen carefully to any complaint that we failed to meet our very high standards and as soon as we became aware of Mrs Fessey's complaint we took urgent action to check our hygiene and cleaning routines. We are working to resolve her complaint.'
