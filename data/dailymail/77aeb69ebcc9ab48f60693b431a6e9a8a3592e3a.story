Marks & Spencer has reported a 13th consecutive quarterly fall in general sales - this time blaming a warm September.

Britain's biggest clothing retailer by revenue said sales of clothing, footwear and homeware, fell four per cent in the 13 weeks to September 27.

Today's results mean that M&S is falling further behind rivals, with Next now more profitable and Primark's sales growth in recent years has soared at rate that M&S would envy.

Boss Marc Bolland has been in the firing line because he has struggled to turn around the High Street stalwart since he took over as chief executive from Sir Stuart Rose in 2010.

But the 130-year-old group did post an increase in underlying first-half profit for the first time in four years.

Under pressure: Marc Bolland, pictured with M&S model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, faces more questions today after the 13th consecutive fall in general sales, which is mainly clothes

Defence: Mr Bolland said that they were getting  'increasingly positive feedback' from customers on its women's clothing lines

Across the group, sales rose one per to £4.9 billion in the six months to September 27 and underlying profits lifted 2.3 per cent to £268 million, compared with City expectations for a decline. 

Mr Bolland said: 'M&S delivered sales growth and increased profit in the first half despite a tough market, particularly in September. We are pleased with the progress we have made against our key priorities for the year.'

Online sales on its new website, part of a £150million revamp, were down 4.6 per cent in the second quarter, but this was better than the 8.1 per cent fall in the previous quarter.

Food sales have slowed to a 0.2 per cent rise in the quarter compared to 1.7 per cent in the previous quarter.

The retailer said up to 200 Simply Food stores are now planned over the next three years, compared with 150 previously guided.

M&S said today it was pleased with results despite ongoing struggles 

M&S shares ended last week at 406.7p having lost 20 per cent of their value since hitting 511p in February. 

But they opened 30p higher because of the news this morning. 

A company spokesman said: 'Womenswear performance continues to improve with growth in full price sales and increasingly positive feedback from our customers.

'However, the recent market conditions remain challenging, with unseasonal weather resulting in high levels of promotional activity across the market.

'Despite some improvement in consumer confidence, market conditions continue to be challenging. As a result, we remain cautious about the outlook for the remainder of the year. However, we are confident that we are well set up for the key Christmas trading period.' 

There have also been complaints by customers about a drop in quality but no drop in price and its production line has been branded sluggish, making it too slow to react to fashion trends. 

But Mr Bolland, who joined the company in 2010, highlighted an improving trend in womenswear following 'increasingly positive feedback' from customers, with sales up 1.3 per cent when excluding September.

M&S also said that a recent survey found than 69 per cent of customers believed their ranges were on trend and fashionable. 

Analysts noted the green shoots but said it was too soon to say whether Bolland was finally delivering a turnaround.

'Beyond the flagship stores, many still feel like museums where older people go to browse black slacks,' said Phil Dorrell, director of the retail consultancy Retail Remedy.

'No amount of hand-wringing about September's unseasonal weather can explain away such weak clothing sales across the six-month period. 

'But Marc Bolland may have done just enough to avoid the rocks - for now'.  

Flop? Leading ladies show off the M&S collection, but clothing and general merchandise sales are down yet again

Rival Next, which has consistently outperformed M&S in recent years, was last week forced to warn that profits for the year will be £25million lower than expected because of the warm autumn.

Next has overtaken M&S in terms of profits, raking in £695million last year to its more established rival's £623million.

But Primark shrugged off the warm winter weather blighting many of its rivals by managing to grow sales during the past four weeks.

Julie Palmer, Partner at Begbies Traynor said: 'Whilst the unusually warm Autumn months has afflicted many clothing retailers, Marks and Spencer’s 1.6 per cent fall in sales demonstrates it has continued to lose market share.

'With Christmas just around the corner, analysts will be watching Marks and Spencer’s food sales extremely closely as success here will surely buy Bolland more time for his strategy to bear fruit. But the biggest test will be whether the new clothing ranges can help M&S regain some of its recent market share losses.'

Neil Saunders, managing director of retail consultancy Conlumino, said there were some glimmers of hope from the retailer, particularly on signs that its strategy of becoming more fashion-focused is starting to pay off.

He added: 'Overall, M&S's school report for this term reads 'showing signs of improvement', but there is quite some way to go before it is back at the top of the class.'  

The latest M&S clothing ranges have been well received by the fashion press but problems with the supply chain have held it back.

Shoppers have complained that stores run out of popular items while its website has suffered teething problems since its relaunch in February. 

Bolland recently insisted that M&S is now 'fit for the future' having spent more than £2.3billion on his turnaround strategy.

But Kate Calvert, an analyst at Investec, said: 'We don't expect much hard evidence to support a recovery thesis yet.'

In fashion: Primark has been described by analysts as a 'retailing powerhouse' that's perfected the art of mixing low prices with high fashion

M&S is being beaten by 'retailing powerhouse' Primark, which has  perfected the art of mixing low prices with high fashion.

Experts say it has won more customers every year by improving improving perceptions of its quality while keeping its prices low. 

It also concentrates on its stores, using its website to promote new items but does not have an online shopping feature.

Stephen Springham, senior retail analyst at Planet Retail, said Primark succeeds by being 'not just cheap but also by being very fashionable'.

He said: 'The fact that the product may lack durability is neither here nor there - its shoppers are after something fast and disposable. 

'The Primark model relies on stores having mass destination appeal and shoppers not knowing what they are going to buy before they go in.

'But they will never, ever leave empty-handed. And they will be back again very soon to do the same again. Customers enjoying shopping, retail as a leisure pursuit - old guard, but highly effective nonetheless.'

The high street giant has also considerably upped its fashion game in recent years, with stronger, on-trend ranges, which sees customers sharing pictures and videos of their shopping sprees at value retailers, analysts Conlumino said.
