Britain's first purpose-built campsite for new age travellers is facing the axe after only a handful agreed to move in because residents were told to pay council tax.

Officials were due to spend £1.2million of public money transforming an existing illegal camp into fifteen state-of-the-art eco plots.

They promised communal allotments, a children's play area, a site manager and environmentally friendly features such as composting bins.

But the plans have stalled after one 
tenth of the itinerants currently there do not want to stay because 
they will not want to fork out for council tax.

Changes: A £1.2m plan to transform this illegal travellers site at Haldon Hill near Exeter has been scrapped because residents have refused to pay council tax

The council had secured a massive £1.2million grant from the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) to pay for the camp, described as the first of its type in the country.

It has left Teignbridge Council in Devon facing a £40,000-a-year management bill for an mostly empty site - or handing back the grant to the Government.

But if the council take the grant, build the site but then no-one moves in - the authority may be forced to pay back the £1.2million.

And they say the only way to make that back would be to increase council tax on local residents by 0.7 per cent a year.

A council spokesman said: 'The HCA have advised the council that should the site cease to operate they are entitled to require repayment in full of the £1.12m grant.

'Assurances have been sought from the HCA that they would not do so but these have not been given.

'Should the site cease to operate, the land value is likely to be a very small fraction of the grant value, leaving the council at risk of having to repay most if not all of the £1.12m back to the agency.'

Cash: The local council had secured a grant for the site but if the transformation is shelved they may have to pay back the cash

The woodland setting has been used illegally for twelve years at Haldon Hill, a nationally recognised wildlife haven off the A38 near Exeter in Devon.

It became home to caravans, old buses, huts and shelters housing up to 100 travellers causing tensions with the local community.

Following a ten year debate to find a solution Teignbridge District Council won a massive grant to upgrade facilities and make the camp legal.

It expected existing travellers to jump at the chance to stay - with the only condition being they would have to pay rates to contribute to the £40,000 annual running cost.

In return, travellers were asked to sign a lease agreement, pay service charges and council tax.

It is thought there are around 100 people there - made up of 15 families and single dwellers.

The council hoped the families, who have children at local schools, would apply to stay at the new-look camp.

But only 11 people have applied to remain - and nearly all made up of single travellers and not families.

Paused: The site was due to have 15 state-of-the-art eco plots with communal allotments, a children's play area, a site manager and environmentally friendly features such as composting bins

Teign Housing, the firm lined up to run the camp, has now said it does not wish to take on an under-used site, populated by mostly single people.

The HCA has given the authority until July 12 to decide if it wants the grant after which the funds will be re-allocated.

Philip Vogel, executive spokesman for housing and planning at the council, added: 'The situation has changed, specifically around the amount of formal expressions of interest and subsequent financial risks to Teignbridge and that requires further careful consideration.'

Ever since the community first pitched up near pretty Kennford village in August 2001 it has officially been 'tolerated' by Devon County Council, the overall authority for the area.

A report for the executive recommends the project should only proceed provided 'satisfactory financial safeguards and indemnities' are obtained to address the 'financial implications of failure'.
