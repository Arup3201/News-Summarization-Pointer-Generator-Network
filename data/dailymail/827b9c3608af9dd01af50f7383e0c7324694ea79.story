A dog found dumped on a remote country lane after giving birth to puppies has had to have her leg amputated. 

Autumn, the Saluki-type dog, was discovered with a fractured back leg in Emley, West Yorkshire, on October 30. 

The animal, who was still lactating after recently giving birth to a litter, was collected by the RSPCA after being spotted by a passer-by, but had such a bad infection her leg could not be saved. 

Autumn the Saluki-type dog had to have her hind leg amputated after being discovered dumped on a country lane

When found, the two-year-old was shivering under a thin blanket of leaves and branches.

Insp Greaves said: 'The injuries she has means that she must have been dumped where she was found rather than made her way there herself.

'She is still lactating, though, which means that there could be a litter of puppies somewhere.

'The vet says it is definitely not a phantom pregnancy.' 

'It is such a shame as she is the sweetest thing. It was just lucky that she was spotted by the people who called us as she was curled up by some tree roots and leaves. 

'Unfortunately we don’t know exactly how the fracture happened but four of the metatarsal bones in her foot were broken. 

The animal had recently given birth when discovered and was still lactating, an RSPCA vet said

Autumn's hind leg was fractured and bones in her feet broken. She then caught an infection which drastically worsened her condition 

Despite the poor condition in which she was found, vets are confident Autumn will make a full recovery 

'Along with the infection, which had spread higher up her leg, it was a double whammy.

'She’s still very poorly but hopefully she’ll made a good recovery as there is no doubt in my mind she’ll make someone a great companion.'

Anyone who has any information is asked to contact the RSPCA and leave a message for Insp Greaves by calling 0300 123 8018.
