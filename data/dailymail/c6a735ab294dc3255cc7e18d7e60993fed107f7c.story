Thousands of people having keyhole knee surgery could be wasting their time, claim researchers.

New research suggests that middle-aged people with mild osteoarthritis get little, if any, benefit as a result.

A study investigated how best to treat torn meniscus, crescent-shaped cartilage that helps stabilise knees.

In the UK many patients have arthroscopic procedures either on the NHS or privately to reduce knee pain.

This involves a procedure called debridement, which involves tidying up damaged cartilage and ligaments or removing loose debris from the joint.

But a study published in the Canadian Medical Journal found surgery is not more effective in the short or long-term than doing nothing.

Arthroscopy involves two small stab wounds made on either side of the front of the knee.

One is for a telescope called an arthroscope, enabling the surgeon to see directly inside the area, and the other is for an instrument to carry out the surgery.

Surgeons typically smooth damaged cartilage surfaces on the end of bones, which can cause stiffness and pain, and flush out bone chips.

The minimally invasive procedure allows for quicker healing than traditional surgery, but can still trigger complications such as blood clots, infection and nerve or blood vessel damage.

Canadian researchers analysed seven good quality trials, involving 811 knees in 805 patients, with an average age of 56 years.

The procedure was carried out for symptom relief in patients with mild or no osteoarthritis, compared with similar patients who did not have arthroscopy for meniscal tears.

In four trials there was no short-term pain relief in the first six months after surgery for patients with some osteoarthritis.

There was no improvement in long-term function up to two years later in five trials.

Study leader Dr Moin Khan, Division of Orthopedic Surgery, Department of Surgery, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, said: ‘Arthroscopic surgery for degenerative meniscal tears in the setting of mild or no concurrent osteoarthritis in middle-aged patients may have little, if any, effect on short-term and long-term outcomes in comparison with nonoperative management.’

He said doctors need to carefully weigh the costs and benefits when deciding which middle aged patients should undergo surgery.

‘With limited evidence supporting arthroscopic meniscal débridement for degenerative meniscus tears in the setting of mild or no osteoarthritis, an initial trial of nonoperative interventions should play a large role for middle-aged people,’ he added.

A 2008 Canadian study found that patients undergoing surgery for knee arthritis did no better than those having physical therapy and taking medication.

Experts believe arthroscopy should not be used routinely to treat osteoarthritis, but say it may still help patients with mild symptoms or a recent injury.

NHS guidelines recommend GPs only refer arthritis patients for arthroscopy when they suffer locking of the knee, not other symptoms.
