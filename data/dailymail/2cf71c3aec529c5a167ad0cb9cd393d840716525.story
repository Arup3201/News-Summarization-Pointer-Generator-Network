When midnight strikes on New Year's Day, John Martin will be sipping champagne as he flies over the South Pole on his 996th flight on a Qantas plane. 

The 82-year-old from Wollongong, just south of Sydney, boarded a 12-hour Qantas 747 flight at around 6pm on December 31, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

As one of Qantas's most loyal customers, Mr Martin was invited on the privately chartered day tour with Antarctica Flights, in which four hours will be spent hovering over the vast Antarctic continent at 10,000 feet, after word spread that he'd been flying with the carrier for over 50 years.

John Martin, 82, will spend his 996th flight with Qantas flying over the South Pole on New Year's Eve

'Why would anyone want to fly an 82-year-old to the South Pole and back on New Years's Eve? But they do, so I have promised to be on my best behaviour,' he told Fairfax.

After completing his 959th flight with Qantas earlier this month, he racked up three million miles with the single airline – the equivalent of flying around the world several times over.

The former television news editor has completed 148 long-haul journeys to New York and 138 flights to London along the way, but he admits that he's already flown on over 1000 other commercial flights with various other carriers when Qantas' flights didn't reach a destination that appealed to him.

'Really, I'm not obsessive about Qantas,' Mr Martin said.

'I never had the aim of doing 1000 Qantas flight, just like I never said I'd live to 82. It just happened.'

The retired television news editor was given the keys to Qantas' 75th Boeing 737-800, a retro-themed aircraft earlier this year

But it wasn't until the age of 32 that the former news editor flew on his first international flight.

'I made my money as a news editor, it was a good salary and a good job and I spent most of it with the tax office and Qantas, and it gave me, I think, the best life in the world. The things I've done, the places I've been, it's been wonderful,' Mr Martin told News.com.au.

As a tribute to his loyalty, the airline recently presented him with the keys to its 75th Boeing 737-800, a retro-themed aircraft with a 1970s livery featuring Qantas' iconic flying kangaroo logo in November this year.

Mr Martin's love for aviation and Qantas runs so deep that he often flies to a destination and back on Christmas Day because his considers airline staff his family.

He also regularly flies from Sydney to Perth or Melbourne and back in one day.

Mr Martin never married and never had children, and he refuses to slow down even though his friends are encouraging him to take it easy as he grows older.

After flying all over the world, Mr Martin can name all of the 278 different aircraft he has flown on thanks to his meticulous record-keeping.

He keeps notes on every Qantas plane he has boarded and is eager to add the airline's first Airbus A380 to his list.

Along the way he has racked up plenty of frequent flyer points, although he doesn't allow them to accumulate.

He told news.com.au: 'I tend to use the (points) before they get too big, because if I died before I used them, it would kill me, it would be the end of the world, I mean going up to heaven with Frequent Flyer Points unused.

'The man upstairs says you can't use them for the last trip, so there's just no way.'
