Vicente Del Bosque (Spain)Louis van Gaal (Holland)Team news: Spain and Holland played out one of the most disappointing World Cup finals in history four years ago. They get a chance to make amends right away in Brazil.

In one of the quirks of the draw for Brazil, Spain opens the defense of its title against the country it beat in the championship decider in Johannesburg four years ago.

But while Vicente Del Bosque's team has stuck to its attacking philosophy, Holland coach Louis van Gaal is packing his defense and hoping one of his three star forwards, Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben or Wesley Sneijder, can snatch a goal on the counterattack in their Group B opener at the Arena Fonte Nova in Salvador.

Key clash: Wesley Sneijder vs Sergio Busquets

Four years ago Sneijder’s performances placed him in FIFA’s All-Star team but he was stopped by Busquets. The Dutch still rely on the Galatasaray playmaker to dictate their tempo but in Busquets he faces an opponent that few get joy out of.

Key men: Holland's Wesley Sneijder and Spain's Sergio Busquets could play key roles for their sides

One to watch: Daryl Janmaat (Holland)

Louis van Gaal’s 5-3-2 experiment should get an outing here and the ‘Dutch Dani Alves’ from Feyenoord will be key to providing width in attack to feed Robin van Persie, as well as defensive cover.

Head-to-head record:

Played 9 Spain Wins 4 Draws 1 Losses 4

Dutch of class: Daryl Janmaat is one of the main men for Louis van Gaal's side

Making the move: Cesc Fabregas has made the switch from Barcelona to Chelsea
