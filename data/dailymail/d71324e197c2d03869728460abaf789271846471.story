The documents, which reportedly hold alleged details of Schumacher's surgical procedures, have been offered to various media outlets for a fee believed to be around 50,000 euros.

Schumacher, the seven-times Formula One champion, is out of a medically-induced coma following the horrific accident incident on December 29.
