Before the game a group of Uruguayan supporters held up a banner showing Suarez wearing an English crown, accompanied by the slogan, ‘GOD SAVE THE KING’.

They had not God but Uruguay’s dedicated medical team to thank, as the 27-year-old returned to torment England, scoring twice in Sao Paulo to inspire his side to a 2-1 win.

It was fitting then that Suarez celebrated his first with one of the men that helped him recover from his knee surgery in May and make it out on to the pitch at the Arena Corinthians.

As soon as his header from Edinson 
Cavani’s cross nestled in the net he sprinted to the touchline, before 
hugging Walter Ferreira and pointing at him as if to say
 ‘this is the man that got me here’.

In the 49th minute he nearly 
doubled Uruguay’s lead straight from a corner. His vicious delivery from
 the left nearly caught out Joe Hart, the England goalkeeper scrambling 
back to palm the ball away just before it went over the line.

Wayne 
Rooney gave England hope when he equalised from close range with 15 
minutes left, only for Suarez to dash those dreams in the 85th minute 
with a venomous strike into the roof after being inadvertently played 
through by a header from his Liverpool team-mate and captain Steven 
Gerrard.

This time his celebration was simpler – a short sprint into the corner where he was swamped by ecstatic team-mates.

Moments after scoring the crucial second he went down with cramp.

Another
 of his Anfield team-mates, Glen Johnson, helped the forward stretch out
 his left leg to ease the pain, but this proved to be the end of his 
involvement and he was carried off on a stretcher.

Liverpool players 
were everywhere you looked at this point. Sebastian Coates, the 
Liverpool defender who spent last season on loan at Uruguayan side 
Nacional, replaced Suarez for the final minutes of the game.

Suarez, overcome with emotion at this point, fought back tears as he watched from the bench as Uruguay held out for victory.

He was then carried aloft by his team as they left the pitch at the final whistle.
