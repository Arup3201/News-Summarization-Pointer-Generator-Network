A California court has ruled that drivers can legally read maps on their cell phones while behind the wheel without being penalized for driving while on their mobile devices.

The 5th District Court of Appeal reversed the case of a Fresno man who was ticketed in January 2012 for looking at a map on his iPhone 4 while stuck in traffic.

The driver, Steven Spriggs, challenged the $165 fine because he did not feel it was right that he had to pay after using his phone while his car was not moving due to roadwork.

Approved: A California court ruled that even though the state requires hands free devices to be used while driving, drivers should not be ticketed for using their phone for directions

He had grabbed his cellphone to find an alternate route when a California Highway Patrol officer on a motorcycle spotted him and wrote the ticket.

Mr Spriggs first challenged the case in traffic court, where he lost, and then appealed it himself to a three-judge panel in Fresno County Superior Court, where he lost a second time.

Mr Spriggs knows the dangers of texting while driving as his son suffered a broken leg from a driver who was chatting on a cellphone. As a result, he always uses a hands-free device to talk and drive.

Determined that the hands free law didn't apply to him in this case, Mr Spriggs took it to the appellate court.

In their 18-page ruling, the appellate judges said California's law that prohibits people from talking on their cellphones without a hands-free device could have been written more clearly, but it doesn't apply to looking at maps on cellphones.

The law the CHP officer used to ticket Mr Spriggs applies specifically to people 'listening and talking' on cellphones, not using their mobile phone in other ways, the court said.

Archaic: Car GPS systems have become common but many drivers still use their phones for directions, which the court ruled was fine because the driver in question was not moving at the time

Texting while driving remains illegal under another California law passed after the one at issue in Mr Spriggs' case.

Attorney Scott Reddie, who represented Spriggs, said it's now up to the state attorney general's office to decide if it will challenge Thursday's ruling to the California Supreme Court, which is choosy about which cases it hears.

Nicholas Pacilio, a spokesman for Attorney General Kamala Harris, said the office is reviewing the ruling.

Neither Reddie nor Mr Pacilio were familiar with other states that prohibit drivers from looking at cellphone map applications.

Mr Spriggs, who is entitled to recoup his $165 fine, said the Superior Court judges who had upheld his violation were guilty of overreaching by applying the spotty law to him.

He hopes that California legislators will now revisit the issue and fix it.

'They're going to have to do something,' Mr Spriggs said.

'I just hope they take a look at the big picture.'
