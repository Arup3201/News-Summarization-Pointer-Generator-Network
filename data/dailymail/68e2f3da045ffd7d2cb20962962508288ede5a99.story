A teenager has been found strangled in a flat above a shop after neighbours reported hearing a disturbance.

Police found Cheryl Tariah's body after being called to the first floor of an east London flat.

A post mortem revealed the 17-year-old had been strangled.

Dead: Police found Cheryl Tariah's body after being called to a first floor flat in east London

An 18-year-old man is being held on suspicion of murder and a 21-year-old man was arrested but released without charge.

The Met's Homicide and Serious Crime Command is investigating the death.

Police say the girl's next of kin are in the process of being informed.

Her body was found in a flat above the Labels clothes store in High Street, Barkingside, east London, just before 4pm on Tuesday.

The teenager was still alive when paramedics arrived, but died at the scene despite efforts to save her.

Detectives
and forensics officers remain at the scene with a section of pavement 
outside cordoned off as the investigation continues.

A neighbour said her mother had heard people shouting in the flat earlier in the week.

The woman, who asked not to be named,
said: 'I don't live here, but my mother has dementia and she said she 
could hear shouting the other night. 

'It
was people shouting at one another, but I don't know what was being 
said. She doesn't speak English so I don't know what happened. She just 
called me because she was scared.' 

A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: 'Inquiries are underway after a death in Barkingside.

'Police were called shortly before 4pm on Tuesday regarding reports of a disturbance at a flat in High Street Barkingside.

'Officers attended and found the body of a woman, believed to be 17, inside the premises.'

She
added: 'A man, aged 21, has been arrested in connection with the 
inquiry and remains in custody at an east London police station.'

A floral tribute was left outside the flat where the teenager was murdered

The girl is the first teenager to be 
murdered in London this year.

In 2011 a total of 15 teenagers were 
unlawfully killed in the capital. A record number of 29 teenagers were 
murdered in London in 2008.

Shopworkers and other neighbours did not know the girl involved, or see what happened.

The flat where her body was found is the only one above the clothing store and could be accessed by the front and back, via a boarded up and derelict-looking staircase guarded by two officers.

The back entrance leads into a residential area, but neighbours said they had not heard anything.
