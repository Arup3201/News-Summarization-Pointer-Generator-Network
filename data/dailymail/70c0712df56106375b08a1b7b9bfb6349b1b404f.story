It is a feat which would put Cliff Richard to shame.

A bright green bus with 600,000 miles on the clock has been saved from the scrapyard - and turned into a holiday cottage.

The 31-year-old double decker boasts two double bedrooms, carpets, sofas, a kitchen, idyllic country views and even a log-burning stove in a creation reminiscent of the 1963 hit film Summer Holiday.

Not your average campervan: Carpenter Adam Collier-Woods, 42, bought this bright green double decker bus on eBay for £4,500 and and turned it into a holiday let with a kitchen, bedrooms and even a log burner

Summer Holiday: Bus 2464 entered service in 1982 and was almost sent for scrap. Its owner now lets it out to up to six people at a campsite in Wealden, East Sussex - with the remains of the seats still intact

Cosy: The bedrooms on the top deck swap sticky floors for carpets and include a vintage lemonade advert

In the film Cliff Richard played a bus mechanic who turned an iconic red London double decker into a touring campervan and drove it across Europe.

The Metro Cammell Weymann metrobus was the same sickly green colour as it is now when carpenter Adam Collier-Woods, 42, bought it on eBay for £4,500.

One of more than 4,000 buses of its type, it entered service in 1982 with route number 2464 and spent almost 30 years on the streets of Coventry, Birmingham and Hull.

It clocked up 600,000 miles - almost the distance to the moon and back.

Mr Collier-Woods spent six months full-time on the project and scoured homeware shops for matching cushions and paint, spending more than £10,000.

He said: 'I saw an old double decker rotting in
 a farmer's field while driving through the countryside last Christmas. By the time I was home I had already planned in my head how it could be 
done. 

Unusual: Most buses today have little room for pushchairs, but this one has found space for a log-burning stove

Watching the world go by: The £15,000 project includes an original seat on the top deck with idyllic views

Parts of the 31-year-old bus could be mistaken for a 1970s caravan - but it is far more sprawling than that

Snug: The double and bunk beds on the top deck call to mind the carriage of an old-fashioned sleeper train

Mr Collier-Woods spent £10,000 fitting out the bus - and finding green furnishings to match the paint

'I had a look on eBay and found that double deckers were not as expensive as I would have thought, so bought one for £4,500.

'I
 quite simply wanted to give people the experience of staying something 
like this, and I think people are interested because it's the type of 
bus they may have taken to school.'

He named it the Big Green Bus and lets it out starting at £150 a night at a rural campsite in Wealden, East Sussex.

With an extra pair of bunk beds - at the back of the top deck for the naughty children - the unique 'cottage' sleeps up to six people.

The carpenter added: 'It was hard to do and it took up all my time for over six months.

'I ran out of money and had to take a carpentry job to raise more cash which put more pressure on the deadline.

'If
 I'd have known just how hard it was going to be I probably would have thought twice before taking it on, but I had blind enthusiasm, and thank
God I did.

'The whole project is one massive recycling exercise. The
 bus was coming to the end of its working life and would have been 
scrapped. But I saved it from a horrible death and turned it into 
something amazing'.

Back row boys: The holiday let's green sofas give new meaning to hanging around at the rear of the bus

Instead of having to inch past passengers with their shopping, Adam's punters see vintage advertisements

No paraffin stove here: The bus goes one better than a campervan and includes a full-scale oven for guests

It may seem unorthodox, but the bus's size gives it a natural advantage over other modes of camping

Tickets please! Parts of the bus which were installed when it entered service in Coventry in 1982 are still intact

Hold tight: The stairs to the upper deck have been decorated with a collage of photos of the sea

Mr Collier-Woods spent £15,000 on the project but wanted to keep it like a bus which people took to school

On the buses: The bus calls to mind Cliff Richard's 1963 hit film Summer Holiday. He played a mechanic who transformed a London double decker into a holiday campervan and drove it across Europe to Athens

The Big Green Bus now lives on a campsite in Wealden, East Sussex. Its creator, carpenter Adam Collier-Woods, 42, said: 'The whole project is one massive recycling exercise. I saved it from a horrible death'
