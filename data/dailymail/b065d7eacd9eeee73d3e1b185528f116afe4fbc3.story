Ben Foster hailed the consistent goal power of Wayne Rooney after the England striker scored his first international goal since October but his 11th in 18 games under Roy Hodgson.

Rooney scored England’s first in last night’s 2-2 draw against Ecuador in Miami from his unfamiliar position on the left wing.

'We wanted some good individual performances and we got them,' said Foster. 'We got a good goal from Wayne as well. That’s what Wayne does. He scores us goals, simple as that.

'Some of the other lads put a good shift in as well. It was a good work-out. It would have been nice to get a win but a draw is not too bad. The manager was satisfied. It was more about the work-out really.'

It was Foster’s first cap for a year and his first start for nearly four. 'It was great to play for England again,' said the goalkeeper.

'It was my first game for a year or so. If you can’t enjoy games like that, playing for England, just before the World Cup, there’s something wrong. I had a fantastic time and really enjoyed it.'

Both teams finished the game with 10-men. Raheem Sterling and Antonio Valencia were sent off in the 78th minute. Sterling, who had only been on the pitch for 14 minutes, was dismissed for a rash tackle on the Ecuador captain, who was also dismissed for retaliation.

'I’m surprised all round,' said Foster. 'I didn’t think it was a red card for Raheem and I played for a few years with Antonio and he’s not that kind of guy.'

Sterrling will be banned from Saturday’s friendly against Honduras in Miami but will be clear to play in the World Cup.

It was not looking so good for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain who looked dejected as he hobbled out of the Sun Life Stadium amid fears he had damaged knee ligaments.

'We’ll have to wait and hope for the best,' said Foster.
