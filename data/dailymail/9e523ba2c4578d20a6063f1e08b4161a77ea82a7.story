Midwives in England have voted to join other NHS staff in a four-hour strike - the first walkout by health workers in 32 years.

Unions are in dispute over the Government's refusal to accept a recommended one per cent pay rise for NHS workers. 

Members of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) voted in favour of the walkout on October 13.

It is the first time the union has balloted for industrial action and will be the first walk out by members in their 133-year history. 

Midwives and maternity support workers of the Royal College of Midwives have voted in favour of strike action. Chief executive Cathy Warwick, pictured, said: 'It could not send a clearer signal about the level of discontent on this issue to those denying them a very modest one per cent pay increase'

An industrial action ballot saw 82 per cent of members vote in favour of strike action, and 94 per cent opting for action short of a strike.

It comes as Unison, which represents 300,000 NHS staff in England, announced last week their members have voted in favour of action.  

Several other unions are balloting  health staff - including midwives - for industrial action, with more expected to join in on October 13 from 7am to 11am.

It is thought up to 500,000 NHS staff represented by nine unions could take part in the planned walk out. 

Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the RCM, said: 'This is a resounding yes from our members. 

'It could not send a clearer signal about the level of discontent on this issue to those denying them a very modest one per cent pay increase.

'Our members have suffered three years of pay restraint and face the prospect that their pay in 2016 will only be one per cent higher than it was in 2010.

Members have voted to walkout on October 13, followed by four days of industrial action. Union bosses have called on the health secretary Jeremy Hunt to accept a recommended one per cent pay rise for NHS staff

'The recommendations from all public sector pay review bodies have been followed except those for health workers. This is not acceptable. 

'There is still time to come back to the negotiating table and to take a more reasonable position on the PRB recommendation.

'The RCM will be meeting with employers to discuss our action and to ensure that mothers and babies are not put at any risk.

'I want to reassure women expecting a baby that midwives will continue to look after them and that they will be safe.' 

The RCM reassured women expecting a baby that midwives will continue to care for them and they will be safe

The Department of Health said they are 'disappointed' RCM has rejected proposals to give NHS staff at least one per cent extra pay this year and at least a further one per cent next year.

A spokesman said they are keen to speak with union representatives to work to make the NHS pay system 'fairer and more affordable'. 

Last week Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: 'NHS members don't take action often or lightly.  

'For many of our members, this will be the first time they walk out as the last action over pay was 32 years ago. 

'The NHS runs on the goodwill of its workers, but this Government has shown utter contempt for them.

'We are working with NHS employers to minimise the impact on patients. 

'But it's not too late for Jeremy Hunt  to act to avoid this and we repeat our offer to the Government to negotiate with us, despite him refusing to meet with health unions about pay.'  

The action will lead up to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) demonstrations in London and Glasgow on October 18. 

The Department of Health spokesman said: 'We are disappointed that RCM is planning industrial action and has rejected our proposals to give NHS staff at least one per cent additional pay this year and at least a further one per cent next year.

'NHS staff are our greatest asset, and we've increased the NHS budget to pay for thousands more clinical staff since 2010, including more than 1,700 more midwives since May 2010. 

'We want to protect these increases and cannot afford a pay rise on top of increments - which disproportionately reward the highest earners - without risking frontline jobs.

'We remain keen to meet with the unions to discuss how we can work together to make the NHS pay system fairer.' 

Gill Bellord, director of employment relations and reward at the NHS employers organisation, said: 'It is regrettable that members of the RCM have agreed to take industrial action along with some of the other NHS trades unions.

'Employers will be concerned that this industrial action could worry pregnant women.

'However we welcome indications from the RCM that its members will continue to provide cover on maternity wards and work with local employers now to ensure that services can be maintained safely on the day of the proposed action.'
