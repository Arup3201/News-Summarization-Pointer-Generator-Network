CEO Adriano Galliani has held off making an offer and it is understood QPR have decided to lower their asking price.

Milan are also discussing a deal for former West Ham loan signing Pablo Armero who will join from Udinese on loan with an option to buy.

QPR boss Harry Redknapp has made five signings already this summer, with the latest coming in the form of Juventus defender Mauricio Isla.
