A soldier killed yesterday in an explosion in Afghanistan has been identified as a 24-year-old captain.

Tributes have been paid to the 'bravest of the 'brave' Rupert Bowers who was killed by the blast from an improvised explosive device (IED) as he led a patrol in Helmand Province.

The married 24-year-old father, from Wolverhampton, had been working as a security adviser to the Afghan National Army.

He was part of the 2nd Battalion, The Mercian Regiment (Worcesters and Foresters), which was attached to 2nd Battalion The Rifles.

Bravest of the brave: Tributes have been paid to Captain Rupert Bowers, who was killed by an explosion in Afghanistan

Captain Bowers commanded a small team responsible for the training and development of the Afghan National Army based in Forward Operating Base Ouellette in the Mirmandab region of Nahr-e Saraj in Helmand Province, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said.

He was leading a patrol to clear a position from the threat of insurgents when he was killed by the explosion.

He leaves behind wife Victoria and his newly-born son Hugo, as well as parents Patrick and Jane and sister Juliet.

Tributes have been flooding in to Captain Bowers, who was described as having the 'heart of a lion'.

Lieutenant
Colonel Colin R Marks, Commanding Officer, Combined Force Burma, 2nd 
Battalion The Mercian Regiment (Worcesters and Foresters), said: 'A 
gifted officer, he excelled in the field and was happiest when leading 
men in battle.

'Possessing the heart of a lion, he was Mentioned in Dispatches for gallantry on this, his first of three tours of duty.

'The bravest of the brave, he died as he lived, leading from the front in the face of the enemy.

'Full
of character, Rupert was fun to be around all the time and I enjoyed 
his company very much.  We talked for hours about his love of piano 
music and he always made me feel happy because he was such a sincere and
fun-loving person.

'His 
brother officers loved him dearly and we will remember him for his 
infectious smile and wicked sense of humour. Married to his beloved 
Vicky, their son Hugo was born while Rupert was home on leave in 
February 2012. I know he was looking forward to rejoining his family 
later this month when his tour was due to finish.

'As
well as Vicky and Hugo, our thoughts and prayers also go out to his 
father Patrick, mother Jane and sister Juliet. Rest easy brother, your 
duty is done. You will live in our hearts forever and we will never 
forget you.'

Lieutenant Colonel William S C Wright
MBE, Commanding Officer, Brigade Advisory Group, 2nd Battalion The 
Rifles, added: 'His infectious smile, constant good humour and immense 
dedication to his men made an instant impression on all of us.

'During
the demanding advisor training, his ability to get on with anyone and 
his strong soldiering skills marked him out as a young officer with real
potential as an Afghan National Army (ANA) Advisor.

'Not
surprisingly, he ended up in one of the toughest areas of Helmand 
working alongside an independent ANA Tolay Company.  He more than rose 
to the challenge.

'It was a
pleasure to see him at work, smiling amidst his Afghan warriors and 
always with an amusing story to tell; life was never dull with him 
around.  The whole of 2 RIFLES are deeply saddened by his tragic loss.  
He was loved and respected by all ranks as one of our own.  He was, and 
will always remain, an honorary Rifleman.'

Lance
Corporal Matthew Moore, Team Second-in-Command, Advisor 34, Brigade 
Advisory Group, 2nd Battalion The Rifles, said: 'Captain Bowers was the 
best boss I have ever worked with.  He was very good at his job, and 
always there for the blokes.  I know he wouldn’t think twice about 
putting his neck on the line for his men.

'Boss, it was an honour serving under your command. Rest in Peace.'

Secretary
of State for Defence, Philip Hammond MP, said: 'I was very saddened to 
learn of the death of Captain Rupert Bowers, a soldier whose bravery and
professionalism was not only apparent to his colleagues every day on 
operations, but had been recognised formally through the honours system 
with his Mention In Dispatches. He died in the service of his country 
and his sacrifice will always be remembered.

'This
is, of course, the most tragic news for Captain Bowers’ family; my 
thoughts and deepest sympathies are with them, as well as his friends 
and colleagues, at this painful time.'

After studying at the Royal Military 
Academy Sandhurst, he was commissioned into the 1st Battalion, The 
Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment in April 2007.

After
successfully passing the Platoon Commanders' Battle Course in Brecon he
joined his regiment in Afghanistan in 2007 where his actions during a 
complex insurgent ambush resulted in him being 'Mentioned in 
Dispatches'.

Upon return 
from Afghanistan he deployed on exercises in Jamaica and later to Kenya,
as a Fire Support Group Commander after qualifying as a Machine Gun 
Specialist.
