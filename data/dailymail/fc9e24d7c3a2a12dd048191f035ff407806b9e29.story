'Smart, amazing girl': World champion water-skier Sarah Teelow has died aged just 20 after crashing at high speed during a race on an Australian river over the weekend

Yesterday, as she was surrounded by those
closest to her, including her parents and her mother's boyfriend, her 
life-support machine at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney was 
switched off.

Devastated friends described vivacious blonde Sarah as 'a beautiful, smart, amazing girl'.

'I just can’t believe she’s gone,' said a close friend of the vibrant young athlete.'

'She was being towed by the boat she won the worlds in, with a crew she trusted. It was just a freak accident. She was an amazing girl.'

Tragedy: Miss Teelow's life-support machine was switched off while she was surrounded by family

Miss Teelow - the daughter of two-time 
world champion Tania Teelow - was left fighting for her life after she 
hit the wake of another boat and crashed on the Hawkesbury River north 
of Sydney in a 112km bridge-to-bridge race.

Police are reviewing a video which shows 
another speedboat travelling in the opposite direction, creating a 
dangerous wake and contributing to her tragic fall.

A friend who witnessed the fall said 
her helmet filled up with water, keeping her head submerged for minutes.
It is understood the fall broke her vertebrae.

Ms Teelow went into cardiac arrest and was resuscitated by paramedics after being moved to a nearby boat ramp. 

The
tragedy comes just two months after she was crowned champion in the 
Formula  2 category at the World Water Ski Racing Championships in 
Spain. 

Tania Teelow made 
headlines in 2008 when she was involved in a high-speed water skiing 
crash at Wiseman's Ferry north of Sydney that left her with a broken sternum, fractured vertebrae and other major injuries.

Australian
Bureau of Statistics figures show that Teelow was the seventh 
water-skier to die in an accident in Australia in the last five years.
