A well-known music promoter has admitted making anti-semitic comments towards a Jewish Labour MP during a drunken tirade at a star-studded awards ceremony.

Luciana Berger was shocked by Philip Hayes' racially abusive rant at the Liverpool Music Awards last year.

Hayes, who has a history of alcohol abuse, suggested that the MP was Israeli rather than British, and later shouted, 'I f****** hate Jewish people' in her direction.

Although he contacted her via Facebook to apologise the next day, magistrates fined him £175 after he pleaded guilty to two charges of racially aggravated disorder.

Liverpool Magistrates' Court heard that Hayes, 53, and Ms Berger, MP for Liverpool Wavertree, were both guests at the VIP event on November 17, which was attended by the likes of Spice Girl Mel C and X-Factor stars Craig Colton and Rebecca Ferguson.

They started discussing the Israel-Palestine conflict, and a drunk Hayes made comments which upset and offended the 31-year-old politician.

'During Mr Hayes and Miss Berger's conversation about Gaza, Mr Hayes made a number of remarks about Jewish people,' prosecutor Amanda Haycock said.

'He said, "All Jewish people have money," and began talking about a Rolls Royce.'

The music mogul referred to a prominent local solicitor as a 'f****** Jewish t***', and accused Ms Berger of regarding Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as her national leader.

Later in the evening, the two crossed paths again. Ms Haycock described how Hayes shouted, 'I f****** hate Jewish people' in the direction of the MP and her friend.

'As Miss Berger was the only Jewish person there she felt the comment was directed at her and she called a cab and left,' the prosecutor said.

The next day Hayes wrote to Ms Berger on Facebook apologising for his abusive language.

However, after a complaint was made to Merseyside Police, the force's dedicated hate crime unit launched an investigation into the incident.

During a police interview, Hayes claimed he could not remember exactly what he said, but admitted he had used foul and insulting language.

His lawyer George White told the court his client had 'fallen off the wagon' after five years battling a drink problem.

'The fact that he was drunk let him down that night and the words spoken were completely out of character,' he said.

'He has let down many of his friends from ethnic and diverse backgrounds.'

Mr White blamed Hayes's drinking on 'financial problems' at The Picket, the legendary Liverpool gig venue he runs which launched the career of Elvis Costello, the La's and the Coral.

'I sincerely apologise for the hurt and offence my behaviour has caused Miss Berger,' Hayes said in statement read by his solicitor outside court.

'Prior to this offence for over 30 years I have always tried to fight racism in every form in my personal and professional life.

'I have tried to promote tolerance and celebration of all races and creeds.

'I don't believe the words I spoke on that night reflect who I am, but I accept that I said them and caused offence by uttering them.'
