An Arizona pet owner arrived home Saturday to find his yard mobbed by an angry swarm of bees and his two 100-pound dogs laying motionless in the dirt.

Lawrence Rios was horrified when he and a roommate saw the state of the beloved companions: one lay swollen and bloody while the other had ripped out his own claws in a desperate attempt to escape the fenced yard.

Before they could help the dogs, the two men were forced to flee as the bees they described as the nastiest they'd ever seen turned their stingers on them.

Sad: These two 100-pound dogs named Atlas and Gypsy were killed Saturday when a swarm of what may have been Africanized killer bees modded their Tucson, Arizona yard

Tragic reminder: Left behind were the carcasses of some of the bees, which chased away the dog's owner before firefighters arrived to fight back the bees by spraying foam

'They were definitely not your average bee because most of them they're not like that unless you really mess with them but these bees were a whole other breed,' Robby DeCesari told KOLD.

Rios called 911 and firefighters soon arrived to spray the yard with a foam that would keep the bees at bay.

It was only then when Rios realized the extent of his dogs'--named Gypsy and Atlas--terrible injuries.

'I rushed them to the vet and they were both dead. These were both 100-pound dogs. Big dogs,' the emotional pet owner told Tucson News Now.

The male dog, Atlas, suffered the worst.

'I've seen the claw missing on his paw, he had gashes all over his head trying to escape from the backyard to get away from the bees. And the other one was really swollen,' Rios said.

It's a sad time for Rios, but he's thankful he and his roommate, who suffered just one sting, got out alive.

Rios believes the trouble began when a neighbor plugged the entrance to a nest hidden inside a cement wall between their properties, which he believes caused them to swarm. 

Africanized honey bees look identical to the native bees and it has yet to be determined which species killed Atlas and Gypsy.

However, the so-called 'killer bees' have been a serious problem in southern Arizona for years.

Last year was especially bad in the area after three times as many people suffered 50 or more stings from the testy bees -- and the problem was even worse in nearby Phoenix.

Back in 2011, a southern Arizona hog farmer  watched in horror as thousands of bees swarmed a 1,000-pound hog during an attack that lasted about two hours.

Horrific: Rios found evidence in the yard that the dogs desperately tried to escape the bees. Atlas even ripped out his own claws in the process
