Hardliner: Len McCluskey, General Secretary of the union Unite, has demanded the sacking of three Blairite members of the shadow cabinet

Union boss Len McCluskey demanded the sacking of three Blairite members of the shadow cabinet yesterday as Labour’s biggest paymaster sought to impose his far left policies.

The boss of Unite threatened Labour with the loss of millions of pounds of donations unless Mr Miliband purges moderates and lurches to the left.

Mr McCluskey also boasted that he has stitched up the selection of candidates within the Labour Party - a process that has enraged more moderate Labour figures.

‘Because we’re having some success, suddenly these people are crying foul,’ he said.

‘Well I’m delighted to read it. I’m delighted when Tony Blair and everyone else intervenes because it demonstrates that we are having an impact and an influence and we’ll continue to do so.’

In a dramatic challenge to Mr Miliband’s authority Mr McCluskey -- who is calling for a general strike -- made clear that he intends to dictate Labour policy.

And he called for shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne, Labour’s defence spokesman Jim Muprhy and shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander to be axed.

In an interview with the New Statesman magazine, he said the Labour leader, who was elected with union votes, would be ‘cast into the dustbin of history’ unless he does as Mr McCluskey wants.

The hardliner accused Mr Miliband of being ‘seduced’ by Blairites in the shadow cabinet and issued a veiled threat that Unite’s money might dry up if he doesn’t get his way.

Mr McCluskey said the unions ‘would have to sit down and consider their situation’ if Labour fails to emerge as ‘the authentic voice of ordinary working people’.

Unite has donated £8,425,166 to the 
Labour Party since Mr Miliband became leader in September 2010. The 
union remains Labour’s single biggest donor, giving 32 per cent of 
donations in the last quarter.

Mr McCluskey said: ‘Ed Miliband must 
spend most of his waking hours grappling with what lies before him. If 
he is brave enough to go for something radical, he’ll be the next prime 
minister.

‘If he gets seduced by the Jim 
Murphys and the Douglas Alexanders, then the truth is that he’ll be 
defeated and he’ll be cast into the dustbin of history.

‘Liam
Byrne certainly doesn’t reflect the views of my members and of our 
union’s policy, I think some of the terminology that he uses is 
regrettable and I think it will damage Labour. Ed’s got to figure out 
what his team will be.’

Mr McCluskey warned that Labour would lose the next election if it adopted an “austerity-lite” programme and supported cuts in public spending after 2015.

‘My personal fear, and that of my union, is that if he goes to the electorate with an austerity-lite programme than he will get defeated,’ he said.

‘If he [Miliband] is daft enough to get sucked into the old Blairite “neoliberalism wasn’t too bad and we just need to tinker with it a little bit”...then not only will he fail but I fear for the future of the Labour Party.’

Mr McCluskey’s intervention is a major headache for Mr Miliband, who has struggled to shake off the appearance of being in hock to the unions who got him elected against the wishes of Labour MPs and Labour Party members.

Last night a spokesman for Mr Miliband risked a rift with the union boss, denouncing his words as an attempt to drag the party back to the 1980s.

‘Len McCluskey does not speak for the Labour Party,’ the spokesman said. ‘This attempt to divide the Labour Party is reprehensible. It is the kind of politics that lost Labour many elections in the 1980s.

‘It won’t work. It is wrong. It is disloyal to the party he claims to represent.” Mr Murphy also hit back. ‘It’s disappointing in advance of important local elections that Len McCluskey turns his fire on Labour,’ the shadow defence secretary said.

But Tory Chairman Grant Shapps said Mr Miliband was powerless to resist union pressure. He said: ‘Len McCluskey’s the man who’s really in charge of the Labour party - and he knows it.

‘Dictating everything from Labour policy, to Shadow Cabinet posts and Candidate selection - the unions’ vice-like grip on weak Ed Miliband grows ever stronger.’
