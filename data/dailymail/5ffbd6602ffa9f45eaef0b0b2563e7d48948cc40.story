He may have been judged a significant enough political figure to warrant a federal holiday - but some Americans seem not even to know Martin Luther King Jr is dead.

A string of pedestrians tracked down on a California street on Martin Luther King day Monday claimed they had seen seen a speech they were told the civil rights leader gave that morning in Washington, D.C.

Speaking to a cameraman for Jimmy Kimmel Live, seven of fourteen people who were asked whether they saw the supposed speech - despite King having been assassinated 46 years ago. 

One seemed to keep believing in the bogus speech, even when they were asked their opinion on Beyoncé and Jay Z having performed as backing singers during the address. 

A man who gave his name as Kenny Pattison, from Birkbeck, California, bluffed his way through questions about the speech, which he said was 'very inspiring, motivational' and 'current for today'.

Another young man, who did not give his name but wore a blue cap and grey shirt, said he was 'shocked' at the appearance - but did not question whether it happened.

He was given several prompts to remember that there was no way he could have given a speech.

Maybe they were dreaming? These two men were keen to discuss the speech - which did not actually happen. The person on the left suggested King could do with losing weight, while the man to the right described Jay Z and Beyoncé's in the event involvement as 'fabulous'

How it was: Pictured above is the famous 'I Have a Dream' speech King gave, in real life, in August 1963

But while he said he was 'shocked' to supposedly see King in person at the U.S. Capitol, and admitted he hadn't 'heard him talk in a while', he never suggested it might be because he is deceased.

Another responded to suggestions and said the American hero, who had parades processing in his honor that very moment, could do with losing some weight. 

Introducing the segment, which aired on ABC, a bemused Kimmel said the lack of knowledge on show was 'disturbing'.

He said that sometimes such videos - where they attempt to fool passers-by into saying something obviously ridiculous - often take the best part of a day to film, but this one took hardly any time. 

Memorial: While Kimmel's ABC show was filming the embarrassing segment, political leaders were honoring King's memory. Pictured above are a collection of politicians in front of the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial in Washington, D.C.
