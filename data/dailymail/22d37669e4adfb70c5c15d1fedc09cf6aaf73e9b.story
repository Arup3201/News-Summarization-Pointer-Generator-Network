Little chef, big price: Kuwati bought the chain for £15million

Little Chef has been gobbled up by Arab investors.

The British chain has been sold to Kuwaiti-based Kout Food Group for 
around £15million by private equity firm Rcapital, saving 1,000 jobs in 
its 81 outlets.

The 55-year-old chain was put up for sale in May when Rcapital said it 
was ‘resigned’ to losing the name as most bidders would want to rebrand 
the chain.

Now the London-based firm can afford almost two million of the café’s £7.69 ‘Olympic’ fry ups.

Describing its ‘deep affection’ for the chain, Rcapital said it had 
managed to secure a future for the brand, whose mascot Fat Charlie 
became a popular image on the nation’s A-roads.

Little Chef was bought by Rcapital in 2007 after going into administration.

Jamie Constable, chief executive of Rcapital, said: ‘Having owned Little
 Chef for a long time it feels like we are selling part of ourselves.

‘But we take comfort that the new owners will take the brand to the next
 stage.’ It is understood several firms, including British coffee chain 
Costa as well as American fast food giants McDonalds and KFC, also bid 
for the troubled firm.

Rcapital cut about 500 jobs and reduced the number of outlets from 234 to 83. All but two have been sold in the deal.

Top chef Heston Blumenthal was also brought in to spice up the menu in 2009, accompanied by a Channel 4 TV documentary.

But the three Michelin starred chef was later dropped because some of 
his dishes, including braised ox cheek and healthy strawberry, yoghurt 
and granola breakfasts, proved unpopular. Managers were also annoyed by 
demands such as talking toilets.

Saved: The deal means 1,000 jobs in 81 branches across the country could be save- along with the brand's well-known mascot

Kout Foods Group said it ‘had exciting plans to revitalise the Little Chef brand’.

Fadwa al-Homaizi, chairman of Kout’s UK arm, said: ‘Little Chef will 
benefit from a process of brand renewal in keeping with current trends, 
supported by traditional British values.’

Kout owns franchises for Burger King, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell in Kuwait, and has been expanding in the UK.

It owns Maison Blanc, the patisserie chain founded by celebrity chef 
Raymond Blanc, as well as more than 30 Burger King and eight KFC 
franchises.

Quintessentially British: The roadside restaurant are best known for their English breakfasts. Customers complained when top chef Heston Blumenthal added granola to the breakfast menu

The Little Chef chain started out as an 11-seat restaurant in Reading in 1958, set up by entrepreneur Sam Alper.

Modelled on American diners, it expanded rapidly through the 1970s and 1980s, boasting more than 400 branches at its peak.

But it suffered from the rise in motorways, service station food courts and a tired menu.
