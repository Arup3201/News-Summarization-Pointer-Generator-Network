This German police worker, known only Detlev G, has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a man who fantasised about being eaten by a cannibal

A German police worker has been charged with murdering and chopping up a man he met on a cannibal website who had long fantasised about being killed and eaten.

The suspect, known only as Detlev G, is said to have been 'obsessed' with cannibalism and met the 59-year-old man from Hanover on the fetishist website.

Police say the victim was tortured, killed and dismembered and body parts were found buried in the garden of Detlev's home in the eastern Ore Mountains, near Dresden. 

The handwriting and document analysis
 specialist was arrested on Wednesday at his workplace, the Criminal 
Technical Institute in the eastern city of Dresden, authorities said.

He
 told investigators that he fatally stabbed the victim in the throat on 
November 4, hours after the two met in person for the first time.

The 55-year-old said he then chopped up the body into multiple pieces.

The
 suspect pointed officers to a number of places around his property, 
south of Dresden, where he had buried the remains, city police chief 
Dieter Kroll said at a televised news conference.

The 59-year-old victim, whose name was not released, traveled about 250 miles by bus from Hanover to the meeting. Scroll down for video

Police started looking into the case when the victim was reported missing on November 11 by a colleague.

Two days later, witnesses told officers that 'the missing man had fantasised since his youth about being killed and eaten by another person,' Kroll said.

The killing happened about a month after the pair first met in an Internet chatroom, police said.

'The victim had been fantasising 
about being killed and eaten by someone else since his youth,' Dresden 
police chief Dieter Kroll told a news conference.

Authorities are now checking whether any body parts are missing or were eaten but the suspect has denied doing so.

The website they used says it deals with 
'exotic meat.'

'He said that his victim wanted to be killed and he fulfilled this wish,' Haase said in a telephone interview.

The case has similarities to that of 
Armin Meiwes, who was jailed in 2002 for meeting, killing and eating a 
computer programmer from Berlin whose life's ambition was to be eaten.

Investigator Maik Mainda said the 
victim and the suspected killer maintained 'very intense contact by 
chat, by mail, by SMS but also by telephone' after first becoming 
acquainted in early October.

Police are only just beginning their investigation, he said.

'I can't give any conclusive 
information yet about the actual motivation of the suspect for killing 
his victim. We are investigating in all directions.'

German media reported that Detlev was previously married but divorced and then started a relationship with a man.

Prosecutors said the suspect did not mention whether he and the victim had any sexual relations before the killing.

The Dresden case 'will show how 
easily people can come together with the most gruesome fantasies on the 
Internet and exchange their perversions in increasingly crass manner,' 
police chief Kroll said.

'In 99 per cent of cases, they get their kick out of the exchange.'

His former wife is also employed by the state criminal investigation office.

In the case of the victim, it seemed his desires mirrored those of Bernd Brandes, the computer programmer who was dismembered and eaten by Meiwes at his home near Kassel in 2001.
