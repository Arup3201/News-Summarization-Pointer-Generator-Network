NicoletteCold-blooded: Nicolette Beard tried to negotiate the murder of her ex while the seven-year-old son they had together heard the conversation Beard

A Texas woman was arrested after bringing her seven-year-old son to meet an undercover cop she thought was a hit man she hired to kill his father.

Nicolette Beard, 33, was charged with solicitation of capital murder Wednesday after paying an undercover agent to kill Anthony Drymalla, the father of her young son.

Ms Beard agreed to end Mr Drymalla’s life for the paltry sum of $4,000, but had difficulty coming up with even that small amount of money.

A friend of Ms Beard’s tipped cops to the scorned woman’s devilish plan to end Mr Drymalla’s life, according to the Houston Chronicle.

With the friend’s help, authorities set up a sting operation to stop the plot before it became a reality, KBTX reported. Mr Drymalla and his family were placed in protective custody while the details of the meeting were ironed out.

Meeting in the parking lot of a College Station, TX., grocery store, Ms Beard told the undercover cop to make it look Mr Drywalla’s death look like an accident and that she ‘wouldn’t have a problem with’  the hit man killing his wife or son, according to an incident report cited by KBTX.

After saying she would pay ‘how ever much it will take for [the hit man] to get it done,’ Ms Beard agreed to pay $4,000 for Mr Drywalla’s death, while their seven-year-old son listened in on the negotiations, reports said.

After providing an old driver’s license photo of the intended target, Ms Beard agreed to go to an ATM to withdraw $2,000 to be paid before the hit, but was unable to take out the money, reports said.

Ms Beard was to pay the other $2,000 after the job was done, according to the agreement made with the would-be hit man.

She instead went home to retrieve $800 she was able to pay upfront with the promise of paying the balance after the deed was done, said reports.

The spiteful woman was arrested the minute she handed the officer the money and is now sitting in jail, no bond has been set.
