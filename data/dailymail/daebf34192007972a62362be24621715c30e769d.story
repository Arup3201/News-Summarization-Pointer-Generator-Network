A nationwide manhunt for a child pornographer has ended with the arrest of a husband and wife accused of filming and molesting their daughters aged six and nine for swapping online.

Michael Serapis Freeman, 39, and Michelle Lee Freeman, 40, surrendered to police at their home in Salem, Oregon this week after learning an acquaintance had identified Michelle from a photo circulated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement last month.

Previously only identified as 'Jane Doe,' Michelle Freeman's picture was extracted from video and photos allegedly showing her victimizing the two girls, Homeland Security Investigators said.

Caught: Michael Freeman, 39, and Michelle Lee Freeman, 40, surrendered to police after learning an acquaintance had identified Michelle in photos released by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in August

Michael Freeman admitted to taking nude photos of his 9-year-old daughter while performing sexual acts on her to the witness of his 6-year-old daughter, according to the criminal complaint.

He described himself having been in a 'bad place' when manufacturing the content and trading it on a photo sharing website.

A scan of that website by the MailOnline shows lists of users providing photos of young boys and girls, many described being under the age of 18, in provocative poses coupled with similarly fueled comments.

Michael Freeman said he engaged in this file swapping of his daughter with another user for approximately one month.

Identified: This 'Jane Doe' photo released last month led to the woman's arrest this week along with her husband in Oregon

'I started it. Somehow she got involved,' he said of his wife who declined to speak with investigators.

Making
their first court appearance in Portland on Wednesday, the couple have 
been charged with sexual exploitation of children while producing child 
pornography.

During the nation-wide search for Michelle Freeman, ICE agents were granted a criminal complaint and federal warrant from a U.S. District Court Judge in Washington, D.C. to arrest the woman.

ICE agents from Los Angeles, California, had been working on the investigation since June 2011 when they executed a search warrant and seized a computer with images that they said depicted the child victims being abused.

Similarities: The appeal by federal agents has echoes of an earlier hunt for a mystery boy pictured in this still released by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations unit

The case has echoes of a similar appeal by the same ICE unit, which in June released a still of a mystery boy who they said was in serious danger. Days after that appeal an arrest was made.

The ICE Homeland Security Investigations is responsible for investigating crime connected to the illegal movement of goods and people into and out of the United States.

Agents target criminal networks smuggling people and drugs across America's borders.

It has 6,700 agents spread throughout 200 American cities and 47 overseas outposts.

A break in the 'Jane Doe' investigation came in June of 2012, when the FBI in Colorado said it seized a computer that had over 200 images and two videos of the child victims with the images of accused suspect Michelle Freeman.

The then-unidentified male in the images has his face obscured and digitally altered in the files, according to an affidavit by HSI Special Agent Jim Cole, who has been working the investigation.

According to their investigation, the male suspect seen was believed to have interest in the outdoors based on a book Animal Tracking Basics which appears in the background of the video.

Investigators say they believe the pictures were taken in February of 2010.

Officials said the case is unusual since a majority of child pornography cases involve male suspects, not women.
