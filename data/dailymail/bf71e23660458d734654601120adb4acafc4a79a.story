Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was one of several celebrities taking courtside seats for the anti-climatic ending to the men's tennis season at the  ATP World Tour Finals.

A packed audience at the O2 Arena in London had expected to see a classic between the world's best players - Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer - before learning that the Swiss was forced to withdraw with an unconfirmed injury.

Mourinho stayed to watch a hastily arranged exhibition match that dragged British No. 1 Andy Murray away from his Playstation to play Djokovic in a first to eight game final.

The Portuguese shared the front row with Hollywood actor Hugh Grant and pop star Will Young - and the group came closer to the action than expected after Djokovic almost collided with them after leaping an advertising hoarding in chase of the ball.

As for the final, Murray managed to win more than the single game he had claimed in his final match against Federer but was still beaten 8-5 by the reigning world No 1.

Djokovic came onto court ahead of playing Murray to receive the trophy, which was understandably a low-key occasion.

Addressing the crowd, he said: 'Clearly this is not the way I wanted things to happen. I'm really sorry for Roger not being able to come to the court.'
