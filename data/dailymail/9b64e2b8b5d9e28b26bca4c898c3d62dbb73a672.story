With a Premier League weekend fast approaching, it is time for many fans to check out their new signings.

These 10 players have yet to play in England, and will be keen to impress. But what can you expect from them? 

1) Toby Alderweireld

CLUB: Southampton. AGE: 25. COST: On loan from Atletico Madrid.

Central defender or right back.

One of the most promising signings of the window, having also attracted Newcastle and Arsenal. Alderweireld is a versatile and technically gifted defender who has represented Belgium at every level from Under 15 up.

He has 37 full caps and played at this summer’s World Cup. He has a point to prove after being deemed surplus to requirements after one season at Atletico, where he had a limited role in their La Liga success. He is a graduate of the Ajax academy and played in the fixture against PSV Eindhoven in November 2010 when Luis Suarez first bit an opponent.

2) Benjamin Stambouli

CLUB: Tottenham. AGE: 24. COST: £4.7m from Montpellier. 

Defensive midfielder.

Stambouli was behind Morgan Schneiderlin on Tottenham’s wishlist but he fits the bill for Mauricio Pochettino. He is a hard worker with an astute tactical brain who is tailor-made for the manager’s high-intensity game. Swansea were interested but Montpellier manager Rolland Courbis told them they weren’t good enough.

‘I don’t think Swansea are the Montpellier of England. When Swansea’s interest came to my ears, I almost laughed. I did a nervous giggle,’ he said. Stambouli’s father, Henri, managed Marseille in the Nineties, while his grandfather Gerard Banide was in charge of Monaco.

3) Radamel Falcao

CLUB: Manchester United. AGE: 28. COST: £6m loan fee from Monaco. 

Striker.

A huge talent who must answer some huge questions. Is he committed to United, having tweeted shortly before his move that he was off to Real Madrid? Is he the same player after major surgery on torn cruciate ligaments in his left knee last season? Can he thrive amid the pressure of a genuinely elite club? 

United can only hope that the Colombian answers the questions with more of the incredible numbers that have shaped his career: 200 goals in 305 club games, with a further 20 in 51 for his country. On form, he’s a wonderful striker.

4) Abel Hernandez

CLUB: Hull. AGE: 24. COST: £9.5m from Palermo. 

Striker.

It’s a big signing for Hull, who hope the Uruguay striker’s pace will work well in conjunction with targetman Nikica Jelavic. Apart from the large fee, this signing is a gamble. 

Hernandez moved to Italy as an 18-year-old but didn’t score more than seven league goals in any of his five seasons in Serie A, culminating in Palermo’s relegation in 2013. 

He proved to be hugely important as they won Serie B last season, scoring 14 goals, and was also part of the Uruguay squad at the World Cup.

5) Daley Blind

CLUB: Manchester United. AGE: 24. COST: £14m from Ajax. 

Left back, defensive midfielder.

He is familiar to Louis van Gaal, having been part of the Holland World Cup squad. Blind is said to covet a midfield role at Old Trafford and has been compared to Philipp Lahm. 

The son of former Ajax and Holland defender Danny, Daley won the title with Ajax four seasons in a row and is the 2014 Dutch Footballer of the Year. 

It will be fascinating to see how he copes away from Ajax, where he signed aged 10, and their manager Frank de Boer, who nurtured him.

6) Marcos Rojo

CLUB: Manchester United. AGE: 24. COST: £16m from Sporting Lisbon. 

Centre back, left back, left wing.

Skilful and fiery, Rojo excelled at the World Cup for Argentina, for whom he has 28 caps. He is a player who needs to be controlled, as demonstrated by his record at Sporting Lisbon — in two seasons he was booked 17 times and sent off on five occasions.

He is covered in tattoos and married to lingerie model Eugenia. He seems to have an aversion to using his right foot so watch out for his ‘Rabona’ kick.

7) Sadio Mane

CLUB: Southampton. AGE: 22. COST: £10m from Red Bull Salzburg. 

Left wing, forward.

His big-money move might have largely stayed under the radar but Mane has been monitored by leading clubs for some time. 

Southampton need his goals and Mane has an impressive record, scoring 45 in 87 games for Salzburg. The Senegal striker is quick and likes to run at defenders.

Sadio Mane is a gamble from Ronald Koeman but his scoring record suggests it could pay off at Southampton

8) Eduardo Vargas

CLUB: QPR. AGE: 24. COST: On loan from Napoli. 

Forward, winger.

It’s been a strange few years for Vargas. In 2011, his agent Diego Cativa said: ‘We’re talking to clubs like AC Milan, Inter, Liverpool, Arsenal and others.’ Barcelona and Chelsea were also reported to be interested. 

But it all went cold after he joined Napoli for £11.5m in 2012 and more than two years on he has not scored a league goal for the club in 19 games. He has been loaned out to Gremio (nine goals in 37 games) and Valencia (five in 25). Now it’s QPR’s turn.

Eduardo Vargas is somewhat of a journey man and QPR are the latest side to bring him in on loan from Napoli

Vargas is a regular striking partner for Alexis Sanchez with Chile and played at the World Cup

9) Ricky Alvarez

CLUB: Sunderland. AGE: 26. COST: On loan from Inter Milan. 

Attacking midfielder.

Gus Poyet’s side struggled to create chances last season and have gone some way to fixing that with Alvarez. They have an option to sign him permanently next summer. 

He is a fine player: good enough to play more than 100 games for Inter and to represent Argentina at the World Cup, albeit as a substitute limited to 30 minutes’ playing time. 

He scored four goals in Serie A last season and got eight assists, which makes his arrival on loan something of a coup.

10) Esteban Cambiasso

CLUB: Leicester City. AGE: 34. COST: Free. 

Central midfielder.

Cambiasso has done quite well for himself with five Serie A titles, four Italian Cups, four Italian Super Cups, one La Liga, one UEFA Super Cup, a FIFA Club World Cup and the Champions League. Even Jose Mourinho raved about him.

He was released by Inter Milan in the summer after 10 excellent years and will spend the season attempting to marshal Leicester’s midfield as they bid to stay up. Nicknamed for years ‘El Cuchu’ — ‘The Old Man’ — he will bring masses of top-level experience to a squad who desperately need it.
