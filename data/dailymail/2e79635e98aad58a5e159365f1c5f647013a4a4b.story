The typical meat-lover will eat 7,000 animals in their lifetime including 11 cows, 27 pigs, and 2,400 chickens, it has been revealed.

By the time they reach 80, just over the average life expectancy for Britons, carnivores will have consumed 30 sheep, 80 turkeys and 4,500 fish each, according to the Vegetarian Calculator.

If rabbits, ducks, geese, goats, prawns, squid and other small animals are included then the total rises closer to 7,500.

The numbers were revealed by Vegetraian Calculator, a campaign group who are urging people to eat less meat to reduce their impact on the environment.

However, meat eater Steve Hunt, 41, from London, said he would never give up eating animals.

He said: 'They think the vegetarian calculator will shock people into giving up meat, but to be honest when I did it I realised I needed to eat more turkey and lamb - I’m nowhere near my quota.'

Bodybuilder Torvald Alexander, 45, of Edinburgh, Scotland, said he was a big fan of meat - but that you should have a ‘healthy, balanced diet’.

He added: 'Providing you don’t overdo it, meat is very good for you, especially chicken and fish.

'I treat myself to a nice leg of lamb every now and again and it does me a few days in leftovers.

Once prawns, squid, goats, rabbits, ducks and other small creatures are included, the total rises to close to 7,500 according to campaign group Vegetarian Calculator

'It’s all about balance - getting enough fresh fruit and veg as well as the odd bit of meat and you can’t go wrong,

'If you eat bacon sandwiches every morning, have a sausage roll for lunch and a steak for dinner then you’re heading for trouble.'

The Vegetarian Calculator Facebook page states: Vegetarians use less resources like water, food, oil, contribute less CO2 to the atmosphere, and animals are not killed for their consumption.

#Raising livestock contribute more to global warming than automobiles, and is the second leading cause of global warming behind industrial pollution.'

NHS guidelines recommend eating meat as part of a balanced diet, however they also suggest limiting the amount of red and processed meat, as it has links to bowel cancer.
