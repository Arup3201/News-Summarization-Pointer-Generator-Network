Tormented: Helen Cowan, 26, fell victim to John Robertson, 45, when she was just eight years old

A woman has told how a secret letter she penned to an agony aunt revealing her uncle had sexually abused her helped to jail him.

Helen Cowan, 26, fell victim to John Robertson, 45, when she was just seven years old. The abuse took place at her grandmother's farmhouse during holidays in Kilmacolm, Renfrewshire.

Miss Cowan, of Edinburgh, wrote a letter begging for help and detailing her years of abuse to More magazine when she was 14.

She wrote: 'For the last seven years John Robertson has sexually abused me. I am ashamed and embarrassed. Can you help me?'

The note was never sent and lay hidden in her bedroom until her anxious parents discovered it.

They contacted the police and Miss Cowan was interviewed about the allegations but no charges were brought against Robertson, her mother's brother.

But after other victims came forward in 2011 police spoke to Miss Cowan again and her evidence has now helped jail her abuser.

Miss Cowan, who has waived her legal right to anonymity, has told of her relief after her attacker was jailed for 12 years at the High Court in Glasgow this month.

She said: 'I had a great childhood and loved going on holiday to my gran's farm. But my perfect family holidays soon turned into my worst nightmare.

'We were a close family and I always looked up to my uncle who lived with my gran as he was nearly 20 years older than me

'I felt I could trust him because he was my mum's brother and he'd say I was his favourite niece and he let me sleep in his room.

'One day, when we were alone he came up and kissed me fully on the mouth. I didn't know what was happening and as time progressed so did his abuse.'

Miss Cowan's agony saw her withdraw into herself and her behaviour became more erratic.

She added: 'As the years went on my behaviour changed completely and I became withdrawn. When I got to 14 I decided to write a letter to an agony aunt in a magazine saying my uncle had been abusing me for years and asked for help.

'I didn't have a stamp so I hid the letter. But my parents were so worried about me they decided to search my room and found the note I'd hidden.

'I came home from school and my parents confronted me about it and I burst into tears admitting it was true. It divided my entire family.'

Detectives quizzed Miss Cowan and Robertson about the allegations but said there was not enough evidence to press charges.

But despite the set back and dealing with her own personal demons Miss Cowan steeled herself to face Robertson again after three other girls claimed he abused them.

She said: 'The police contacted me and told me other victims had come forward. I was terrified of dragging up the past but I knew I had to speak out so I could finally get justice.'

Robertson forced his victims to appear in court after denying he raped or sexually abused them between 1990 and 2002.

He was found guilty of sexually abusing Miss Cowan and another girl and of raping two others.

Miss Cowan said: 'I couldn't believe he pled not guilty. I was so nervous but when asked if I wanted to sit behind a screen I said no as I wanted to face him.

'And for the first time in years I looked him straight in the eye and thought, â€˜You took so much away from me and you deserve to be punished.'

'When I heard he had been found guilty, I wept with joy and relief. No amount of time will make up for what he took away but now he will lose years of his life like the ones he took from me.'

Judge Michael O'Grady QC told Robertson: 'You have been convicted of an appalling course of conduct. You spent years preying on children.

'Two of them were raped on seven occasions. With some of your victims you have blighted their young lives and with some you have ruined and haunted their adult lives.'

Miss Cowan added: 'Now I have seen justice done, I feel I can close that chapter in my life. I have a good family who have supported me through everything. I'm looking to the future and moving on with my life.'

A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: 'Helen was very brave to come forward and report this crime.

'Even after the passage of time all reports of sexual abuse will be thoroughly investigated and we would encourage any person who has been a victim to report this to the police.'
