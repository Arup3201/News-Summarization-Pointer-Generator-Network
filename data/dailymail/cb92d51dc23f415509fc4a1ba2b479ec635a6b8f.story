A schoolboy passed a first aid course and then went home and saved his younger brother's life just hours later.

Quick-thinking James Reed, nine, stopped his three-year-old brother Harri from choking after he stopped breathing and started to turn blue while eating a sandwich.

James, a cadet volunteer with St John Ambulance, sprang into action and used the first aid skills he'd learned earlier that day and gave Harri three strong blows to the back.

Lifesaver: James, nine, had learned how to save someone's life when they are choking just hours earlier in his role as a cadet volunteer with St John Ambulance

The youngster's actions dislodged the piece of food from Harri's windpipe and he was able to catch his breath again.

James, of Mountain Ash, South Wales, said: 'I had been shown what to do that day but I never thought I'd have to use it so quickly.

'I could see Harri was choking so I just did what I'd been shown and it worked really well.'

James will now be presented with a special award by St John Ambulance for his lifesaving efforts this weekend.

Sprang into action: James struck three firm blows on Harri's back and managed to dislodge a chunk of sandwich that had become lodged in his windpipe

Reward: James's heroics have earned him an award from St John Ambulance which he will receive this weekend

His proud mother Zara, 34, said: 'The boys were in the living room eating while I was having a cup of tea with my mum in the next room.

'Suddenly I heard James shout: "Mum, mum, Harri's choking."

'I ran in to see Harri was red in the face and starting to turn blue.

'James had already begun giving Harri first aid and after three strong back blows the food flew out.

'Harri was able to catch his breath and he was a bit shaken afterwards.

'I'm so grateful that James had been shown the skills needed to save a life.

'If he hadn't have been there the outcome could have been very different. I am really proud of him.'

Keith Dunn, chief executive of St John in Wales, added: 'James and Harri's experience shows that knowing what to do in the first minutes of an emergency situation could dramatically increase your chance of survival.

'Our aim is to have a first aider on every street and this case shows you are never too young to learn these vital life skills.'
