Paul Scholes is set to turn down the opportunity to become the new manager of Oldham Athletic.

As revealed by Sportsmail on Wednesday, officials at the League One club were keen to make a stunning move for the 40-year-old Manchester United legend after Lee Johnson was poached by rivals Barnsley.

Contact was made and talks are ongoing but it is understood that while Scholes, a lifelong Latics fan, was flattered he does not believe the timing is right.

He is currently heavily involved with non-league Salford City, of whom he is co-owner with a number of his Class of '92 former United team mates, and has a number of media commitments.

Scholes is thought to have not ruled out taking the reins at Boundary Park in the future but should he spurn their advances Oldham will turn their attention elsewhere.

The news is likely to come as a blow to fans of promotion-chasing Latics, still reeling from Johnson's shock defection to a team seven places below them in the table.

First team coach Dean Holden will be in charge for Saturday's Lancashire derby with Preston North End. Scholes lives in Oldham and has been spotted on a number of occasions in the stands over the years. 

He is a close friend of Latics chairman Simon Corney and last season oversaw a number of training sessions. Former Oldham manager Iain Dowie has been linked with the vacant hotseat but it is not known whether the cash-strapped club could afford him. Ex-Blackburn star and Manchester City coach Scott Sellars has also been linked with the vacant post.
