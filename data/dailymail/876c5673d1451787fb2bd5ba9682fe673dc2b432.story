Death: Ashley Smith, died in 2007  after she choked herself to death

Prison guards stood by and filmed a teenage inmate as she gasped for breath while she slowly choked to death in her cell.

Ashley Smith, died in 2007 at Kitchener’s Grand Valley Institution for Women in south Ontario.

For the first time, the full video depicting the asphyxiation of the troubled teenager was played to a jury this week at the coroner’s inquest.

The video shows the guards watching the 19-year-old through a hatch door in her cell.

At the time the video begins, recorded at 6:45 a.m., guards had been debating for about 10 minutes what to do about Smith, according to CBC News.

Smith was institutionalized for much of her adolescence in the youth system in her native New Brunswick before being transferred to the federal adult system.

Vessels in Ashley’s face and eyes had 
burst and her face had gone mottled from previous times she had tried to
 asphyxiate herself.

Guards had been told she was seeking attention, and were instructed not to intervene unless she stopped breathing.

Tragic: Smith seen left communicating with guards at the window before her death and right after guards rush in to try and save her

But in the video guards had watched Smith on the floor – wedged between a steel bed and the wall – as she occasionally heaved, her dying gasps picked up on the video.

She is seen wearing a quilted jacket which is given to patients who self-harm or as a restrain jacket.

She has her head pressed against the wall and is motionless, reported the Globe and Mail.

'It’s been long enough for me to take that off,' a guard calls through the door.

'Sit up so you can come over here and I can cut it off.'

'Ashley. Can you get it off yourself?'

Captured: The camera was then being operated by Valentino (Rudy) Burnett, a correctional officer. He is pictured here watching the video at the inquest

As her faces turns a deep purple and she is motionless, the guards enter the cell and try to rouse her by slapping 
her on the back, without any response.

The guards begin to perform CPR, though one of them is heard swearing that she has not had any CPR training in 11 years.

The camera was being operated by Valentino (Rudy) Burnett, a 
correctional officer who was temporarily working at Kitchener’s Grand 
Valley Institution for Women.

Mr Burnett and three other prison employees were originally charged for their role in Smith’s death, but the charges were dropped.

'Will
 you agree with me, Mr. Burnett, that you in essence videoed somebody’s 
death?' asked Julian Falconer, the Smith family lawyer.

But Mr
 Burnett replied: 'While I was videotaping her, I saw her chest rising 
on a number of occasions. I saw her breathing on a number of occasions. 
As far as I was concerned, I was videotaping a live person.'

Imprisoned: Smith was admitted directly to the segregation unit at Kitchener's Grand Valley Institution  on August 31, 2007

He said it was not his job to save her life - he was 'just concerned with doing what I was asked to do.'

Howard Rubel, lawyer for the correctional officers union, defended the guards, who struggled and debated how to deal with Smith, reported CBC News.

'They were following what they were told was in the best interests of Miss Smith and they were trying to help her as much as possible to prevent the tragedy, but unfortunately, they weren’t allowed to prevent that tragedy as they saw fit,' he said.

Smith was admitted directly to the segregation unit on August 31, 2007.

With the exception of a few hospital visits, she remained in isolation until she choked to death on October 19.

Blaine Phibbs, a correctional officer, testified he first saw Ashley Smith try and choke herself within 12 hours of her arrival.

Smith was first arrested at age 13 for assault and causing a disturbance, and was jailed at 15 after throwing crab apples at a postman.

Her time in the federal prison system was marked by repeated incidents of self-harm.

The presiding coroner has also said the inquest should examine the way the prison system treats the mentally ill.

Outside court, Canada Press reported the Smith family lawyer Julian Falconer said he had little sympathy for the guards who failed to save the teen's life.

'Human beings are human beings; good people do bad things,' Mr Falconer said. 'On that day, a group of guards did bad things.
