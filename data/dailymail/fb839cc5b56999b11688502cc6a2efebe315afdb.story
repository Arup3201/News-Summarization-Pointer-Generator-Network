The daughter of Hong Kong's embattled leader has risked fuelling anger among pro-democracy protesters after apparently mocking taxpayers on Facebook.

Chai Yan Leung, whose father CY Leung is facing calls to quit by the end of today, reportedly attacked commenters who criticised a necklace she was wearing in her profile picture.

In a string of inflammatory remarks on her purported Facebook page, she sarcastically thanks her detractors by pointing out that the necklace and her other expensive clothes were paid for by public funds through her father's salary.

The post goes on to berate their level of intelligence, adding: 'Most of you here are probably unemployed... it's okay - your mother still loves you.'

The page has since been taken down and Chai has been unavailable for comment to verify the authenticity of the account.

However, a number of respected Hong Kong newspapers including the South China Morning Post and the Standard have previously reported that the page was hers.

Chai Yan Leung (above), the daughter of Hong Kong's embattled leader, has risked fuelling anger among pro-democracy protesters after apparently making a series of derogatory remarks about taxpayers on Facebook

In a string of inflammatory remarks on her purported Facebook page, she thanks her detractors by pointing out that the necklace and her other clothes were indirectly paid for by public funds through her father's salary

In a posting on the page yesterday, according to Coconuts Hong Kong, Chai said: 'This is actually a beautiful necklace bought at Lane Crawford (yes- funded by all you HK taxpayers!!

'So are all my beautiful shoes and dresses and clutches!! Thank you so much!!!!)'

She adds: 'Actually, maybe I shouldn't say "all of you" - since most of you here are probably unemployed hence have all this time obsessed with bombarding me with messages.

'Actually considering the standard of English I've skimmed through at times I doubt you'd even understand what the term "social media platform" means... it's okay - your mother still loves you.'

It came as China today threw its weight behind Hong Kong's embattled leader in his face-off with pro-democracy protesters who have threatened to occupy government offices unless he steps down as Chief Executive by the end of today.

The People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, said in a commentary Thursday that the 'central government fully trusts Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying and is very satisfied with his work.'

It added that it firmly supports the Hong Kong police - criticised for using tear gas and pepper spray on the protesters last weekend - to 'handle illegal activities in accordance with the law.'

The week-long street protests by thousands of demonstrators pressing for freer elections in Hong Kong are the biggest challenge to Beijing's authority since China took control of the former British colony in 1997.

They oppose the Chinese government's decision in August that all candidates in an inaugural 2017 election for the territory's top post must be approved by a committee of mostly pro-Beijing local elites.

They say China is reneging on its promise that the chief executive would be chosen through 'universal suffrage.'

Student leaders who have played a key role in organising the protests initially wanted to meet with Leung, but after Sunday's clashes with police, they have stepped up calls for his resignation and asked that the central government in Beijing heed their demands for genuine democratic reforms.

Raising the stakes of the stand-off, student leaders demanded Wednesday that Leung resign by midnight Thursday. 

Supporters of Hong Kong's democracy protesters turned on their cellphones while gathered at a downtown park in Los Angeles  in a show of support for the thousands of people in Hong Kong who have taken to the streets to protest the Chinese government's decision not to allow open nominations for a new leader

If he doesn't, they said they would step up their actions, including occupying government buildings.

That raised the specter of another clash with police, who have been guarding various government buildings. Since Monday, the protests have been peaceful.

On Thursday morning, several dozen mostly student-age protesters were trying to block the road outside the entrance to the chief executive's office in the government complex. Police manned barricades at a nearby intersection, with protesters camped on the other side, huddling under umbrellas.

'We are not asking C.Y. to come talk to us. We are demanding he resign,' said May Tang, a 21-year-old student at Lingnan University, referring to Leung. 

'It's too late for his government to be accountable to the people so we want a new one.'

One protester disagreed with the student leaders' threat to occupy government buildings.

'Getting into a confrontation with police doesn't seem peaceful to me,' said Wilson Yip, a 22-year-old recent university graduate. 

'If they try to force themselves inside and confront police, I don't see what kind of point that would make. It may make fewer people support the protests.'

The Chinese government appeared to be losing patience.

An editorial solemnly read Wednesday evening on state TV said all Hong Kong residents should support authorities in their efforts to 'deploy police enforcement decisively' and 'restore the social order in Hong Kong as soon as possible.'

In the commentary published Thursday, the People's Daily said that the rule of law must be safeguarded 'in order to realize the healthy development of democracy and politics in Hong Kong.'

'Handling affairs without following laws, Hong Kong society will be in chaos,' it warned.

The protesters, it said, had 'flagrantly violated Hong Kong's law and regulations, seriously blocked traffic and disrupted social order. 

They have put a handful of people's political demands above the law, even hijacked the will of Hong Kong people for their personal interests.'

In Washington, Secretary of State John Kerry met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and said the U.S. supports the 'highest possible degree of autonomy' in Hong Kong. 

He said he hopes Hong Kong authorities exercise restraint and allow the protesters to express their views peacefully.

Wang said that the protests are 'China's internal affairs' and that no country would allow 'illegal acts' against public order.
