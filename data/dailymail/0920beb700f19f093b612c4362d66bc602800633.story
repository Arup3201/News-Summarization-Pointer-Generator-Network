The goals came from Senegal and Croatia but manager Steve Bruce says Hull’s long-term success will very much depend on home-grown talent.

Midfielder Mo Diame headed in his third goal in four matches from a cross supplied Andrew Robertson, the impressive Scottish full-back.

Nikica Jelavic made the points safe and ended Crystal Palace’s unbeaten league run under Neil Warnock with a strike after English midfielder Jake Livermore’s through pass.

In his four league games for Hull, Mo Diame has scored three goals, the same number as he scored in his last 25 games for West Ham.

‘All this nonsense that we’re not producing players, sometimes they need a stage to play on,’ Bruce said. ‘We decided that we needed a few younger players because we haven’t produced many.

‘We’ve now got a nucleus of very good young players. I include Tom Ince and Harry Maguire in that. Jake Livermore’s only 23, you think of him as a seasoned professional. It’s his second season in the Premier League. We’ve got some good young players, which is important.’

After conceding 13 goals in five matches before Saturday, Hull reverted to the 3-5-2 formation that served them so well in the last two seasons and it worked perfectly during the 2-0 win. 

Only a free-kick from Mile Jedinak and a 30-yard shot from Yannick Bolasie came close to troubling Steve Harper, while the hosts’ main threat was posed by their wing-backs, Ahmed Elmohamdy and Robertson.

Robertson, 20, joined Hull from Dundee United for £2.85m in the summer. Two years ago, he was playing part-time football for Queen’s Park in the Scottish third division.

‘I have to be honest and say he’s totally and utterly shocked me with his ability to step in,’ Bruce said. ‘For 20 years old, and play at the highest level — he’s going to have a big, big future.’

Warnock, searching for positives, highlighted the performance of Martin Kelly. The former Liverpool defender moved from right-back to a central role after Scott Dann was injured in the 12th minute.

‘He’s such a good pro,’ Warnock said. ‘There’s a lot more to come from him, I think. He’s looking a little bit sharper, now he’s had a few games under his belt.

‘Kenny Dalglish thinks that’s he’s best position — right-side centre-half — and I don’t think he did anything wrong. I thought he was super.’
