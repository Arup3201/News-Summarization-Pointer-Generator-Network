Brendan Rodgers has admitted to watching Liverpool's 3-3 draw with Crystal Palace back three times and is still in shock at what happened on Monday night.

The Reds were leading 3-0 with just eleven minutes to go when Crystal Palace staged an incredible comeback to draw level and leave Liverpool's title hopes in tatters.

'I have watched it three times and I'm still in shock at what happened. I can't believe how we get to 78 mins with such control and not win,' said Rodgers.

Still in shock: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has watched the Reds' 3-3 draw with Crystal Palace three times

'The level of football shows we can cope with the pressure. You can only focus on what has happened and how we can improve.

'We
 have had a really successful season. Everyone at the start of the 
season probably thought the top four was a big ask yet here we are 
talking about the title. It's my job to make sure we improve again.'

Rodgers
 has been proud of his players this season and insists his team will 
fight for the title until the very end, despite the fact Man City hold a
 two point lead over Liverpool and have a superior goal difference.

'I want to congratulate my players on this season. They have put Liverpool on the world map.

'Come
 Sunday we will fight to the very end. To come second to the richest 
team in history of sport is incredible. This is only the beginning.

'I
 see and hear about other teams that will improve but I think we will 
improve dramatically. Steven Gerrard will improve dramatically next 
season. We are really excited.

Meanwhile,
 Liverpool looked relaxed ahead of the final day of the season, perhaps 
safe in the knowledge that the pressure is off.

Liverpool will retain their state of relaxation in the build up to the final day.

They know the destination of the trophy is out of their hands now and will be hoping for a Hammers victory at the Etihad.

No matter what happens over the weekend this has been Liverpool's finest season for years, with Sterling and a number of others showing they can mix it with the best.

The brand of football they've played has been thrilling and they have taken part in some of the most exciting matches of this, or indeed any other Premier League season, with the standout games being the 3-2 victory over City and the amazing 3-3 draw at Crystal Palace.

With a couple of additions over the summer Rodgers believes they can have another tilt at the title. If they tighten up at the back, it would be difficult to argue with him.
