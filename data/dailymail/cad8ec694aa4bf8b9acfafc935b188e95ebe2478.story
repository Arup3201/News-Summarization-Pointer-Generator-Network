As the wife of a proud Scotsman, her attempt at a Caledonian burr should be pitch perfect.

But Claire Forlani, who is married to actor Dougray Scott, makes a mealy-mouthed attempt in her latest advert for a leading whisky.

She plays a temptress in the Dewar’s whisky promotion, which have drawn criticism because of the 40-year-old English-Italian’s cringe-inducing accent.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Unconvincing: Forlani's hammy acting and poor attempt at a Scottish accent have been the subject of criticism

Stereotype: Forlani rolls her 'R's in an attempt to get master the regional accent and refers to a man called 'Angus'

US audience: The campaign for Dewar's has not been released outside the States. The agency behind the ad has defended Forlani

The latest advert, for Dewar’s 
Highland Honey blend, shows Forlani standing at the window of a 
brick-facade apartment, looking seductively into the camera and purring:
 'You should be asking yourself - what is sweetness without a little 
bite?'

Oddly, the actress is then stung by a bee that lands on her finger.

She uses her stung finger to stir her glass of whisky, and tastes the blend.

She then looks behind her into the apartment and says to a character off camera: 'Be careful Angus.'

Screen Siren: Forlani has had success in the past starring opposite Brad Pitt in the 1998 film Meet Joe Black

Scotland's favourite export: Dougray Scott, 47 from Fife and has come close to bagging the role of Wolverine and James Bond

The advert is Dewar’s third featuring Forlani, the first being released in October 2012 and a second in December 2012.

The campaign, which is only aired in America, has Forlani referring to a mystery man named Angus at the end of each commercial.

The
 first two Dewar’s ads drew criticism for Forlani’s ropey Scottish 
accent and the script, which talks confusingly about the benefits of 
being serious and going too fast.

The
 American ad agency Opperman Weiss, which created the campaign, explains
 that Forlani entices drinkers as 'Dewar’s siren' with the 'presence of a
 queen and the mouth of a gangster'.

Lost in translation: Dougray Scott had an overly-formal British accent when he appeared on US show Desperate Housewives

Criticism: Viewers expected Forlani's accent to be better considering she had been married to a Scot for six years

They said: 'She has a strong, 
commanding grip over the edgy, underground world and exudes her power 
through her piercing attitude, cutting tongue and entrancing beauty.

'She draws the viewer in from the moment she is seen, enticing men and pulling them into her clandestine world.'

Viewers from both sides of the Atlantic took to online forums to berate the original commercial.

One annoyed American commented: 'Scots accents have been butchered in countless US shows and movies, but I tend to think of those as US attempts to fake a Scots accent.

'This is a Scottish distillery using a Brit to “sound” Scottish to the US audience. Just seems wrong.'

Another poster said: 'I’m Scottish and that’s painful - she really overdoes rolling the Rs and her pronunciation of ‘benefits’ is very weird.

'But this ad wouldn’t go out in Scotland as is, since whisky is never sold as “Scotch” in Scotland.

'I really don’t understand the last bit - I can’t make out what she says, not least because it’s in a faux Irish accent.

'Whether it’s actually meant to sound like a Scottish accent, or it’s meant to sound like a Scottish person doing a bad Irish accent, I have no idea.'
