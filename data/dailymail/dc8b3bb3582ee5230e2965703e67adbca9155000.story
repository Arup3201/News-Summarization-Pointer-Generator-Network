It's the picture the world has been waiting to see.

Fabrice Muamba sits up his hospital bed wearing a wide smile almost two weeks after collapsing mid-way through a match.

The footballer's fiance Shauna Magunda posted the heart-warming image earlier today to say thank you to the millions of fans who have supported her partner after he suffered a near fatal heart attack.

It shows the Bolton FC star wearing a blue hooded sports top and lying back in his hospital bed. His smile shows the miraculous recovery he has made since the game on March 17.

Ms Magunda wrote alongside the image: 'Fab wanted me to post this pic for you all and to also say thank you for such overwhelming support.'

The picture attracted a string of emotional responses from fans on the social networking site.

One wrote: 'God bless you Fabrice. You keep on fighting, son. Get well soon.'

Muamba's heart stopped for 78 minutes as paramedics - including a cardiologist who leapt onto the pitch from the stands - battled to keep the player alive.

He was rushed to the London Chest Hospital, where he 
was visited by his Bolton team-mates and a string of football friends.

It was later revealed that 15 defibrillator shocks were administered before the sportsman began to show signs of life.

The incident stunned the football community and heralded a worldwide outpouring of sympathy for the 23-year-old player as his family urged fans to prey for him.

The picture will delight the legions of football supporters who have followed the plight of the youngster. He is likely to undergo a long rehabilitation before he can come close to playing again.

Meanwhile, a student who mocked the footballer on Twitter after he collapsed today lost his appeal against a 56-day jail term.

Liam Stacey, 21, of Pontypridd, south Wales, sobbed as he was taken away following the failed sentence appeal hearing at Swansea Crown Court.

Stacey now faces being thrown off his University course. He had been in the the final semester of his three-year biology degree but with the case gaining widespread publicity, his barrister Paul Hobson said Stacey's future was now in tatters.

Mr Justice Wyn Williams told him he rejected an argument that Stacey had already been punished enough. He said the Swansea University biology student had admitted an offence, racially aggravated public disorder, of intent.

'He was intending to say what he said and was intending to produce the effect that he did.'

The court heard Stacey has been treated as a 'pariah' by other prisoners since he was locked up.

High Court Judge Mr Justice Wyn Williams told him: 'There can be no avoiding the conclusion that your offence was committed in the context of a grave illness that had afflicted Fabrice Muamba.

'It was immediately apparent that he was gravely ill and while he was lying prostrate on the pitch you posted comments that were extremely racist couched in terms that can only be described as extremely offensive.

'What was written was capable of being read by any user of Twitter and these messages provoked a very strong response.

'You received responses which were extremely critical but you did not desist - instead you posted eight messages which were extremely abusive and insulting.

'You later realised the enormity of your behaviour and tried to apologise. But you deserve to be punished for your actions. It can’t be argued that a term of 56 days is too long for this offence.

'By pleading guilty you admitted a racist intent to your comments.'

Stacey was watching the FA cup match between Spurs and Bolton Wanderers on TV when Muamba fell to the ground.

Earlier he had been drinking while watching Wales win the rugby Grand Slam match against France.

Stacey Tweeted: “LOL, F*** Muamba. He’s dead!!! £haha,” - then posted eight further offensive racist messages.

Stacey was jailed for 56 days on Tuesday after admitting racially aggravated harassment and disorder.

The reviled tweet came at a time when the Bolton midfielder's plight was attracting a 
wave of sympathy around the world.

Football fans watched in horror as Muamba collapsed after suffering a heart attack during the FA Cup clash.

Millions witnessed the incident at White Hart Lane as Bolton's clash with home team Tottenham Hotspur was screened live on television.

Stacey, seen arriving at the court earlier in the morning, posted a series of vile tweets about footballer Fabrice Muamba

But after a drunken Stacey received a deluge critical replies to his distasteful tweet, he responded with a torrent of racist abuse on the website.

A criminal conviction for a racially 
aggravated public order offence has all but killed the undergraduate's 
dream of becoming a forensic scientist.

His incarceration means he will not be able to sit some upcoming exams - and as a result will fail his third year.

But more importantly, next month 
university officials will hold a disciplinary hearing to decide whether 
to kick out the suspended Stacey for good.

Swansea University student Jon May, who is the features editor for 
student newspaper The Waterfront, said there was not a great deal of 
sympathy for Stacey - despite him once being a popular figure.

'A lot of people have been calling for him to be expelled,' added the 22-year-old business management undergraduate.

'What he said has shocked a lot of people on campus. He's currently suspended at the moment, and a disciplinary hearing is going to take place in April.

'Given what has happened, the whole affair is hardly a good news story for the university.'

Support for Stacey’s jail sentence was widespread on the day it was handed down, and widely debated on Twitter.

But a significant minority criticised his punishment and claimed it was politically motivated to make an example of him.

His legal team will tomorrow launch an appeal against his sentence at Swansea Crown Court.

The hearing, which is expected to last at least one hour, will go before High Court judge Mr Justice Wyn Williams.

The messages were forwarded to the police by several members of the social network, including former England striker Stan Collymore, himself a victim of abuse on Twitter.

Stacey initially claimed his account 
had been accessed by somebody else, but later pleaded guilty to racially
aggravated harassment, and was sent to prison to ‘reflect the public 
outrage’ at his comments.

As he spent his first night 
behind bars, the two teams replayed the
fixture that was called off when the midfielder came close to 
death.

Tottenham and Bolton met again at White Hart Lane, with the home team cruising to a 3-1 victory.

It means Muamba's club are now out of the FA Cup, but this hardly seemed to matter to the fans and players treating the match as a chance to pay tribute to him.

Team-mate Sam Ricketts was seen to wipe a tear from 
his eye before kick-off. It was a difficult return for the entire Bolton
squad, and manager Owen Coyle commended them for their bravery.

Players from both sides wore T-shirts
bearing messages of thanks to those who supported Muamba, while the 
whole of the Tottenham stadium erupted in applause for him.

Stacey, meanwhile, faces expulsion from 
Swansea University. The third-year biology student had hoped to become a
forensic scientist. Describing his tweets, prosecutor Louise Barron 
told the court: ‘The offence is clearly racially aggravated.

‘There was sustained and gratuitous 
racism. These were unprovoked comments and persistent abuse. The 
recipients were disgusted.’

Jailing the student at Swansea 
Magistrates’ Court, District Judge John Charles said: ‘Not just the 
footballer’s family, not just the footballing world, but the whole world
were literally praying for Muamba’s life. Your comments aggravated this
situation.

‘I have no choice but to impose an immediate custodial sentence to reflect the public outrage at what you have done.’

Stacey made his comments about the 
Bolton midfielder while celebrating the Welsh 
rugby team’s Six Nations grand slam victory earlier this month.

The judge added: ‘You committed this 
offence while you were drunk and it is clear you immediately regretted 
it.

'But you must learn how to handle your alcohol better.’

Stacey, from Pontypridd, South Wales, 
told police following his arrest at his student home in Swansea: ‘I was 
at the bar when I heard what had happened to Muamba.

'I don’t know why I 
posted [the comments]. I’m not racist and some of my friends are from 
different cultural backgrounds.’

He later sent a text message to a 
friend saying: ‘I said something about Muamba that I shouldn’t have and 
tweeted back to some people who abused me.

'Getting police on me now 
which isn’t good at all.’

Another read: ‘Been bawling my eyes out on the phone to my mother for the last hour, really can’t be dealing with this.’

Gareth Jones, defending, said Stacey 
‘does not bear [Muamba] any grudge and is glad he is making a good 
recovery’.

He continued: ‘My client simply lost his head and posted 
these disgusting comments to the bitter shame of himself and his 
parents.

'For a moment of madness, his career has now gone.’ 

Stacey’s
father Neale, 49, and mother Hayley, 46, were visibly shocked when the 
details of his comments were read aloud yesterday.

Jim
Brisbane, chief crown prosecutor for CPS Cymru-Wales, said: ‘Racist 
language is inappropriate in any setting and through any media.

'We hope this case will serve as a warning
to anyone who may think that comments made online are somehow beyond 
the law.’
