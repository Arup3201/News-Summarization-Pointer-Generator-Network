Hip hop star J. Cole has spoken out about the significance that society places on skin-tone, claiming President Obama wouldn’t be in the White House today if he was of a darker hue.

The rapper described colorism within the black community as ‘a sad reality’ and ‘brainwashing’ which had lead some to believe that people with lighter skin should be treated more favorably than those with darker skin.

To expand upon his point by cited both the President and himself as examples.

Hip hop star J. Cole has said that he doesn't think President Obama would be in the White House if he was a darker hue

‘Barack Obama would not be President if he were dark skin. You know what I mean? That’s just the truth,’ he told BET. 

‘I might not be as successful as I am now if I was dark skin. I’m not saying that for sure, I’m still as talented as I am and Obama is still as smart as he is, but it’s just a sad truth…,’ he said. 

This isn't the first time the rap star has spoken out about 
the complexities of colorism, both within the African American community
and in society as a whole.

In the past he has talked of making a concerted effort to feature dark-skinned women in his music videos rather than all light-skinned women like some other artists do.

After tackling racism, Cole went on to 
discuss homophobia and claimed he doesn’t regret using the word ‘f****t’
on several tracks on his most recent album ‘Born Sinner.’

‘The
line was to engage the conversation of homophobia in Black culture and 
in hip hop. I thought it was going to be a way more interesting 
conversation that came from it.

Cole called colorism 'a sad truth' and cited himself and the President as people who probably benefited because they are light skinned

'Of course I made the statement, but I thought from that it would spawn better conversations like, "Why are we so homophobic?"' 

Last month Cole, 28, issued an apology over an offensive lyric about autism, but he was less contrite about using the gay slur.

‘It’s much different than the autism thing, it wasn’t conscious; that was a slip-up, being offensive without intent,’ he said.

'I’m not innocent of it (f****t). I am part of that same culture – but why? That line was supposed to be offensive and confusing, but I was hoping to have more conversations about it.‘

Cole has been in the spotlight this summer after his recent
album Born Sinner jockeyed with Kanye West's Yeezus
when released in June and reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 the following
week.

That album also contains moments that some might consider offensive. In
Drake's song 'Jodeci Freestyle' Cole raps that he's 'artistic' while his rivals are 'autistic, retarded.'

Cole wrote that when he first heard a backlash from those
who deal with the developmental disorder he immediately realized he went too
far.

Taking it back... Rapper J. Cole apologized last month for his offensive lyrics in a verse he contributed to Drake's track 'Jodeci Freestyle'

'I was instantly embarrassed that I would be ignorant
enough say something so hurtful,' Cole wrote. 'What makes the crime
worse is that I should have known better.'

'To the 
parents who are fighting through the
frustrations that must come with raising a child with severe autism, 
finding
strength and patience that they never knew they had; to the college 
student
with Asperger's syndrome; to all those overcoming autism,' Cole wrote. 
'You deserve medals, not disrespect. I hope you accept my sincere
apology.'

Cole goes on to write that he's inspired by those who
reached out to him: 'I have now read stories online from parents about
their struggles and triumphs with raising an autistic child and I admire how
incredibly strong you have to be to do so,' he wrote.

'It's touching.
It also makes what I said even more embarrassing for me. I feel real
shame.'

Cole believes in artistic freedom and says he views
envelope pushing in music the same way he does in comedy: 'It's going to
ruffle some feathers at times.'
