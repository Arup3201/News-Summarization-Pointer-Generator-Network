It may be a 600-year-old sacred monument built to mark an ancient dynasty, but clearly noone told the over-exuberant driver of this Ferrari supercar.

City authorities in Nanjing, China were left fuming at the luxury car manufacturer when a dealership employee sped a Ferrari 458 Italia across the ancient city walls, leaving the Ming Dynasty relic scarred with huge black skidmarks.

Ferrari had arranged an exhibition of driving on the ancient city walls of Nanjing as part of a publicity event for the Italian car maker.

Ferrari said the driver behind the wheel for the irresponsible driving was an employee of a local dealership

But rather than driving carefully across one of the longest walls in China, the person behind the wheel of the supercar pulled large 'donut' across the 600-year-old cobbles, leaving long black tyre treads on the protected monument.

City officials in Nanjing said the car was supposed to be part of a ceremony earlier this week to mark the 20th anniversary of Ferrari's entry into the Chinese luxury car market.

The stunt clearly did not go quite as planned, however, leading the Italian car marker to issue a grovelling apology of 'deep regret', before describing the incident as an 'accident'.

Bad idea: The driver seemed oblivious as to his historical surroundings when he span the car around on the cobbled surface

Ferrari also said the skidmarks left on the ancient city walls were 'unacceptable', adding they would be taking steps to prevent similar incident in the future.

The incident is all the more embarrassing in light of media reports in China claiming that Ferrari paid 80,000 yuan to use the city walls, and that the use of the site had not been approved by archeological authorities.

The official Xinhua news agency said Qinhuai district tourism bureau had been reprimanded over the incident.
