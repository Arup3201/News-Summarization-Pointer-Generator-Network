These are the incredible scenes faced by the nation's 4,600 fearless water rescue volunteers every day.

In a collection of more than 400 photos offering a rare glimpse behind the scenes of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, men and women dart, dive and crash through the British seas.

The remarkable pictures follow the volunteers around the clock - from storm-ridden night rescues to their mid-morning cup of tea.

Accompanied by a foreward from Prince William, the images, captured by crew member and professional photographer Nigel Millard, have been hailed as a unique snapshot of a long-standing institution.

Powerful: Ireland's first Tamar class lifeboat, the Kilmore Quay Killarney has been braving the waters off the south-east coast of Ireland since 2010

Battling the British seas: Volunteers for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) have been captured working around the clock in harsh conditions for a new book

Veteran: Ned Dillon is the Coxswain at Arklow, the oldest RNLI station in Ireland. Nigel Millard spent two years charting the work of some of the longest-serving volunteers

Makeover: Porthdinllaen's new all-weather 'Tamar class' lifeboat, John D Spicer, gets its first coat of paint in RNLI colours. In the early years of the RNLI lifeboat hulls were painted in pale blue, later changed to the dark Royal Blue seen on today's lifeboats. They are a far cry from oar boats used before the 1890 steam ship came in

Calm: Alderney Trent lifeboat Roy Barker motors off in unusually kind conditions. The waters here are known to be difficult, with severe winters and fierce running tides

Dramatic scenes at the annual Round 
the Island race on the Isle of Wight are documented in the collection, which will soon be touring the nation.

night to evacuate a passenger from the cruise ship Aurora.

Lifeguards are snapped on an early morning training session on Perranporth beach in Cornwall before reporting for duty.

And one of the Cornish team's top boats, Rose, is shown launching off the slipway.

The characters of the RNLI have also been captured, including Ned Dillon, the coxswain at Ireland's oldest station, Arklow, and Gwyneth Atkinson, who has been fundraising for the organisation for 10 years.

Ready for next time: The Achill Island lifeboat is called to sea, the crew's all-weather gear is stowed in the boathouse. They are nothing like the 19th century cork jackets

Tough: The lifeguards face conditions of all kinds. These workers are up early for a morning's training session on Perranporth beach before going on duty for the day

Putting training into action: Hours later, at Tenby in South Wales, the lifeboat and lifeguards from across the region come together to provide safety cover for the annual Ironman triathlon event. Under their watchful eyes, more than 1,300 athletes undertook a 2.4 mile swim, before setting of on a 112-mile cycle and a full marathon

The
RNLI, a charity that saves lives at sea, was set up in 1824 as the 
National Institution for the Preservation of Life at Shipwreck.

In
1838, Grace Darling, 22, became a celebrity of the day by rowing one of
the organisation's boats out to sea single-handedly to save a crew 
wrecked on the Farne Islands.

In 1854 the name was changed and volunteers were given lifejackets made of cork.

During the Second World War, they moved from sail and oar power to petrol-run boats.

The change coincided with women joining the force.

Mr Millard, who has worked for the 
RNLI for seven years, said he hopes the images will give people a better
understanding of their work.

For him and his 4,600 colleagues, who man 235 lifeboat stations across Britain, sailing stormy seas is all in a day’s work.

Mr Millard, who lives in Brixham, Devon, with wife Caroline, said: ‘I was taking pictures of the RNLI crew in 2005, and ended up volunteering myself. I’m on call 24 hours a day. I see people in the very worst situations, and I also see the best in people.

'When a yacht capsized and 21 crew had to be rescued from the sea off the coast of Baltimore in Ireland, we battled for hours to get everyone safely on the lifeboat. As we sailed back, there was a huge crowd waiting.

'The villagers had bought dry clothes and found houses at a holiday park for the survivors to stay in. It was wonderful to see.’

Mr Millard added: 'My favourite photo is a casualty's eye view. I've been a man overboard on exercises - once in the water, you see nothing, then just a tiny bit of orange, and it's not the sun, it's a lifeboat. It epitomises the work I do and the work of the RNLI.

'I hope the exhibition will raise awareness of the charity. People who don't know anything about rescue at sea will get to hear about it, they will know we're here to help. 

'Someone might be inspired to volunteer - not necessarily on the crew, but maybe as fundraiser. Or some might wish to donate.'

The images will appear in a book published by Conway on 30 September and a touring exhibition, set to hit London, Southampton, Manchester and Edinburgh.

Dr Huw Lewis-Jones, historian and author of the book, The Lifeboat: Courage on our Coasts, said: 'It's a show of great photos that represent the best of the RNLI. It's a way of reminding people they are only ever 70 miles from the sea - we may all need the RNLI's help.

'We've joined crews all around the country on shouts, but also for a cup of tea. The photos are a collection of what the RNLI family means, the true spirit of the RNLI - ordinary people doing extraordinary things.'

The RNLI operates 237 lifeboat stations in the UK and Ireland and has 200 lifeguard units on beaches around the UK.
