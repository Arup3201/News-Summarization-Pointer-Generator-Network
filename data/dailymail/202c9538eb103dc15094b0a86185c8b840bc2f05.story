This is the horrifying moment a vicious thug stamped on a shopkeeper's head six times as he lay unconscious on the floor during a terrifying newsagents raid.

The shocking CCTV footage shows shop owner Naresh Nagarajah being pinned to the ground by a hooded robber, while a second man mercilessly stamps on his skull as he tries to crawl away.

The helpless 36-year-old was beaten so badly that he feared he was going to die. He was  left with a fractured eye socket and severe bruising all over his body.

This is the horrifying moment a vicious thug stamped on a shopkeeper's head six times as he lay unconscious on the floor during a terrifying newsagents raid

The shocking CCTV footage shows shop owner Naresh Nagarajah being pinned to the ground by a hooded robber, while a second man mercilessly stamps on his skull as he tries to crawl away 

Nottinghamshire Police released the 66-second CCTV footage today in a bid to track down the three culprits

Sickeningly, a third man, who does not appear to be involved in the beating, is seen stepping over Mr Nagarajah, as his two accomplices continue with the brutal assault.

Speaking after the attack, Mr Nagarajah, who has owned and run the shop for eight years, said: 'I remember being hit and kicked and trying to escape. I thought I was going to die.'

The attack, which Mr Nagarajah says has left him 'traumatised', took place after the three men walked into MV Supermarket in Arnold, Nottingham, just as the shop was closing on March 3.

The video shows the three thugs knocking over stacks of cans, before one of the men begins punching the father-of-two to the ground.

After leaving him unconscious, the men then flee from the store with around £5,000 worth of cigarettes.

Nottinghamshire Police released the 66-second CCTV footage today in a bid to track down the culprits.

Mr Nagarajah added: 'When I think about what happened, it's very scary.

'I have two children. Will the next one come to my house? I'm worried about their safety.

'It was around closing time, I had gone out to close one of the two metal shutters, then just popped back into the store to turn off the CCTV screens, and then turned round and the men were there.

'It was so traumatic and horrendous that I think I have blacked out several parts of it.'

He added: 'They had metal things on their hands. One of them was holding me. He sat on me and punched me. I remember being hit and kicked and trying to escape. I thought I was going to die.

'They caught me and I don't know what happened next, but then I remember trying to crawl away and they were shouting about giving them money.

'But we don't keep money in the shop, so they started stamping on my head, and I remember my energy leaving me and I thought this could be the end. That's when I passed out. 

'Apparently when they had left I phoned the police, but I don't remember that and I don't remember going to hospital.

'I looked back at the CCTV afterwards and a man actually stops a few metres after walking past the shop, because he has obviously heard something, but then after three or four seconds he walks off again.'

The three attackers have been described by police as being of 'muscular build' and being between the ages of 22 and 28. 

Speaking after the attack, Mr Nagarajah said: 'I remember being hit and kicked and trying to escape. I thought I was going to die'

Detective Inspector Rich Monk, from Nottinghamshire Police, said: 'This was a particularly violent and cowardly attack on a man who had no chance to defend himself.

'The injuries he suffered, as nasty as they were, could have been so much worse.

'We are releasing this footage because we believe someone in Nottinghamshire knows who these men are.

'Perhaps you recognise something about their clothing or the way they carry themselves. Or maybe you have heard someone bragging about the robbery.

'If you know something then we hope you take one look at this CCTV footage and pick up the phone. You can help us get these men off the streets today.'
