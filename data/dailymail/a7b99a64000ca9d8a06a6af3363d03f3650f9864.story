The boss of HSBC has been forced to forfeit £1.3million of his bonus after the bank was embroiled in two of the biggest episodes of mis-selling affecting thousands of customers.

The decision to strip Stuart Gulliver of the financial award was yesterday described as a symbolic gesture of remorse by Britain’s biggest bank.

HSBC is also clawing back shares and cash from several senior employees.

Bonus surrender: Stuart Gulliver is being stripped of £1.3million from his bonus - but he will still take home an extra £5.9m on top of his £1.25m basic salary

However, on the day it posted a profit of just under £14billion for last year, it emerged Mr Gulliver will still receive a £5.9million bonus on top of his basic salary of £1.25million for his 2011 performance.

Critics welcomed the decision to claw back the money and encouraged other banks to follow suit, but conceded it is unlikely to make a major dent in the pay package of some the UK’s richest bankers.

The five highest paid staff at the bank shared pay and perks worth £27.7million – an average of £5.5million each. Some 192 HSBC staff will take home around £1million each.

The bank, like others in the UK, was caught up in the mis-selling of payment protection insurance – policies sold to maintain loan repayments in case of illness or redundancy.

Thousands of elderly and frail customers were also persuaded to put life-savings into risky investments that would never come to fruition while they were alive by employees of HSBC’s Nursing Home Fees Agency.

Top results: HSBC posted profits of £14billion last year. Following the results, 192 staff will take home bonuses of at least £1m

Deborah Hargreaves, chairman of the High Pay Centre, said: ‘It’s great that they are finally being hit where it hurts – in their pockets. The only thing I regret is they aren’t being told to give up more of their bonuses.’

Richard Lloyd, executive director at consumer group Which? said: ‘It is good to see action being taken and the pressure is now on for the other banks to follow this lead.’

The news comes just days after Lloyds Banking Group ‘adjusted’ payouts to 13 directors, reducing them by £2million to reflect the scandal of mis-sold insurance.

HSBC said last night it has increased to £396million the amount it has set aside for PPI compensation pay-outs.

The bank refused to reveal how many of its top staff would be affected by the claw back. But those whose share windfalls are understood to have been affected include Mr Gulliver’s predecessor, Michael Geoghegan.

Group finance director Iain Mackay has also been penalised but still receives a package of £2.5million, including a £1.1million bonus.

The bank said cuts were not about penalising individuals but that the compensation bills meant it had ‘overstated’ previous profits.
