Tragedy: Anna Maria Mostrom, 29, has been left brain dead after a bus crash on Roosevelt Island in New York last week

A Swedish model and former Scandinavia's Next Top Model contestant has been left brain dead after a bus hit her while she riding a bike.

Anna Maria Mostrom, 29, was cycling on Roosevelt Island in New York last week when the bus  turned left and knocked her onto the road.

She has been eft with serious brain injuries and is now on a respirator at Weill Cornell Medical Center where doctors saying her prognosis is 'bleak'.

Her friend Timothy Philips told the New York Daily News: 'They are making preparations to donate her organs, which will save a lot of lives.'

After arriving at hospital he said that the family, who have flown in from Sweden, have received an 'outpouring of love' and that the walls of her room are covered in notes and photos. 

Miss Mostrom, who was not wearing a helmet at the time of the crash, has undergone two surgeries to stop the bleeding in her brain and is on full life support.

Mr Philips also wrote on Facebook:'Thank you all for showering AnnaMaria with so much love and hope from near and far. 

'Her family and many of her friends are gathered here with her now and the staff of the hospital says that they have never witnessed such an outpouring of love and affection for anyone before. 

'Please know someone has been at her side every moment since her arrival, she has never been alone. 

'The walls of her room are covered with notes and photos as flowers are not allowed in intensive care. 

'Even at 3am last night there were ten loved ones beside her bed.

'The light within her is fading but her star shines brighter than ever. 

'Open your eyes and heart wide and you may just see it in a flower or a bell like laugh on the breeze. 

'Please keep Anna Maria in your thoughts, your love guides her path now as her spirit reaches its destination.'

He added that staff have told them to 'hope for a miracle' as they have never seen someone recover from similar injuries.

Police have said the 51-year-old driver has not been charged and remained at the scene after the crash.

He was behind the wheel of the Red Bus, which circles the island, and was going south when he hit her.

The island between Manhattan and Queens is sparsely populated and has little vehicular traffic as many people normally reach it by the Subway or gondola. 

Miss Mostrom, who grew up in Kongstorm in central Sweden, was a contestant in the Scandinavian version of Top Model in 2005, which helped to launch her catwalk career.

She took part in the Swedish pre-cycle of the show but missed out on a place in the main series. 

For the past two years she has lived in New York City  and was said to be looking for more opportunities in the creative industry.

Her father Ronnie told a Swedish Newspaper Expressen she was 'rammed' by the bus and her family are holding a vigil for her at her bedside. 

The Roosevelt Island Operating Cooperation who run the buses says that they are investigating the incident and insisted they are 'actively working to ensure that our streets are safe for cyclists and motorists'. 

A campaigner has said the incident was 'tragic' but 'all too common and 100 per cent avoidable in New York City'. 

Keegan Stephan, the founder of Right of Way, told Mail Online: 'In New York City, a pedestrian or cyclist is seriously injured or killed by a motor vehicle driver every single day, and the cause of the vast majority of these crashes is speeding or failure to yield by the motorist. 

'The NYPD must charge this driver with the criminal offense of failure to yield and the District Attorney must prosecute that crime to the fullest if we are ever going to curb this epidemic and ensure that Maria does not die in vain.'

Talented: She is pictured with Czech model Karolina Kurkova at the Global Film and Music Festival in Ischia, Italy, in 2011. Miss Mostrom had been living in New York for two years before the incident
