A mother has spoken of her daughter's devastation after a police helicopter was called to her 15th birthday party when hundreds of youths turned up thanks to a Facebook post.

Dozens of officers were sent to the disturbance at Bernard Manning’s Embassy Club in Harpurhey, Manchester.

Staff called in police after the venue became overrun by more than 250 revellers at a 100-guest private function held for the teenager, who lives a short distance from the venue.

The club took the 
decision to close early as the 
venue reached capacity. More than a dozen police cars and 
tactical aid unit vans raced to the scene at around 10.30pm on Saturday 
as revellers spilled out into Rochdale Road and reportedly began making trouble outside.

The teenager's mother Kim said the teenager had organised and paid for the event herself.

'She was devastated,' Ms Jones told the MailOnline.

'She got up on stage and said "don't be disrespectful, if you're going to be rowdy please leave".

'She was gutted (when the event was cancelled) but she would rather it get closed down than get out of control.'

Police spent around 45 minutes calming the situation and dispersing the crowd. No arrests were made and no crimes were reported.

Mrs Jones said the staff at the Embassy Club handled the situation well.

She said: 'They have never done a 15th birthday party before, they did it as a favour.

'The party got out on Facebook, it was just one of those things - it got completely out of control.

'The venue wasn't at fault at all. When the numbers got too high they shut the doors.

'There were people outside but they were just being rowdy, there weren't any fights.'

Controversial comedian Bernard Manning, who died in 2007, first made his name as a singer and compere in working men's clubs and comedy clubs in the north, gradually introducing more jokes into his act.

He opened the venue in 1959 and was the chief performer for 40 years until he had a stroke in 1999. Manning achieved fame across the UK when he made his television debut in the 1970s on Granada TV's stand-up comedy show The Comedians.

Famous musicians to have performed at the club include The Beatles, Johnny Cash and Cilla Black. His son, Bernard Manning Junior now runs the venue.

Chief Supt Nick Adderley, of Greater 
Manchester Police, said: 'The licensee took the decision to close the 
venue and some fighting broke out on the road outside.

'We
 responded quickly to the reports and made sure the crowds were 
dispersed away from the club as quickly as possible before things 
escalated any further.'

Local councillor Pat Karney witnessed the 'mayhem' as he returned home and is to write to GMP Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy calling for an inquiry.

He said: 'It was a scene of complete mayhem and as we were there, police car after police car was racing towards the area.

'It is very concerning how a 15th birthday party has got so out of hand that such a large amount of police resources have been needed to get the situation under control.'

Linda Gray, 44, who lives on Rochdale Road, said: 'At first I thought it was some sort of riot, there were more police than I’ve ever seen in one place at one time and there were hundreds of people, mainly young men, who looked quite intimidating and like they were spoiling for a fight.'

One teenager who was at the party said: 'It was pure carnage for a few minutes and people were either kicking off or running off down Rochdale Road.'

The Embassy Club declined to comment.
