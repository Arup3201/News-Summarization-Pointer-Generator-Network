Smiling broadly for the cameras at the 2006 premiere of Superman Returns, director Bryan Singer wraps his arm around the British teenager who filed a lawsuit on Monday alleging that the Hollywood heavyweight sexually assaulted him.

Now aged 25, the British man accuses X-Men director Bryan Singer of sexually abusing him when he was 17 at a London hotel along with Broadway producer Gary Goddard.

Holding the pictures up to the media today at a Los Angeles press conference, the unidentified man's attorney, Jeff Herman, said that his client was spurred to bring a lawsuit against the filmmaker after Singer was sued by another man on similar allegations.

The lawsuit in federal court in Los 
Angeles said that Singer, 48, and entertainment industry executive Gary 
Goddard, 59, coerced the British man into sex acts as a minor with the 
promise of helping him in an acting career. The man was not identified 
in court papers.

This is 
the second lawsuit naming Singer ahead of the May 23 release of his film
 X-Men: Days of Future Past, which is expected to be one of the year's 
top grossing movies.

Singer's
 lawyer has called the allegations in both lawsuits false and 
fabrications, and a bid to win money from the director behind other 
films in the X-Men superhero franchise. A lawyer for Goddard also denied
 the allegations, calling them spurious.

The
 plaintiff's lawyer, Jeff Herman, also represents Michael Egan, who last
 month sued Singer, Goddard and two other entertainment executives over 
allegations that they abused him as part of an underage sex ring in 
Hollywood.

'He did this to 
support Mike, he realized he wasn't the only one this happened to,' 
Herman said at a news conference as he held aloft pictures of his client
 with Singer and Goddard from the 2006 premiere of Superman Returns in 
London.

According to The Daily Beast, Singer, along with Broadway musical producer Gary Goddard, allegedly engaged in inappropriate acts with a British teenager in the bedroom of a London suite around the time of the release of Superman Returns - which Singer directed - in 2006.

The suit has been filed by Egan's attorney, Jeff Herman, on behalf of plaintiff 'John Doe No. 117'.

It claims Goddard contacted the teen when he was 14 via social media, commenting John Doe was attractive and that he knew people who could help kickstart his acting career.

One of those people, Goddard said, was Singer.

Thereafter, Goddard told the boy he was in love with him, and 'convinced' the boy to send him nude photographs and a video masturbating.

They then allegely engaged in a webcam session which involved Goddard masturbating.

When John Doe was 16, Goddard invited him to London and plied with the boy with alcohol, before he  'engaged him in anal intercourse'.

When the teenager was 17, the suit alleges, Goddard told the teenager he and Singer were coming to London for a Superman movie premiere. 

At the after-party, the suit alleges that Singer offered the teenager a Quaalude, which the teenager rejected.

In the bedroom of the hotel suite, where an 'after' after-party was being held, Singer and Goddard, the suit says, 'starting grabbing John Doe in a sexual manner'.

The teenager asked the men to stop. Goddard allegedly returned to the room with a 'large, musclebound man' who began to smack the teenager around, using physical violence, according to the complaint. 

The bodyguard held the boy down while Singer allegedly grabbed his buttocks.

Singer and the large man stripped John of his clothing before Goddard, who was naked on the bed, told the man to leave the room.

Singer grabbed John Does's penis kissed John on his waist and thighs, and then placed his mouth on John’s penis, the suit says.

Fresh allegations: A second man has stepped forward claiming Bryan Singer sexually abused him when he was a minor

'Singer told John to fondle his penis, but John refused,' according to the complaint.

'Singer then grabbed John's buttocks and attempted to insert his fingers into John’s anus. 

'Singer then removed his boxer shorts and John said, ''I do not want to do that''.

'In response, Singer said to John: ''Then just sit on top of me and [masturbate]; I want you to [ejaculate] on me.'

'John Doe, believing that the only way for him to leave safely without being anally raped was to comply with Singer's demands, sat on top of Singer and masturbated, ejaculating on Singer.'

The next morning, according to the complaint, Singer contacted the teenager to apologize.  

The teenager, the suit contends, “only recently became cognizant that he has suffered psychological and emotional injuries, mental anguish and loss of enjoyment of life as a result of the Defendants’ sexual acts. 

Such injuries are ;severe, continuing, and permanent'.

The suit contends that Singer violated the law by sexually assaulting the teenager, traveling to a foreign country for 'illicit conduct with a minor,' that he had arranged to 'meet with a minor to engage in lewd and lascivious behavior', and that by allegedly coercing the teenager in the way he did, Singer committed an act of 'gender violence' against him.

Marty Singer, the lawyer for Bryan Singer, told The Daily Beast the allegations contained in the latest lawsuit were 'totally untrue'.

Accused: Disney TV president David Neuman, pictured, was also named in a recent lawsuit by Egan

Singer is already fighting the claims brought forward by Egan, who said he was given drugs and promises of a 
Hollywood career while being threatened and sexually abused in Los 
Angeles and Hawaii.

One
 of Egan's alleged attackers, internet businessman Marc Collins-Rector, was
 convicted of sex abuse charges in the years after the attacks, but it was the first time Singer was named.

Singer's lawyer said credit card receipts, telephone records 
and production schedules show that he was not in Hawaii when the lawsuit 
claims he sexually abused Egan.

Singer
 was mainly in Toronto working on the first X-Men movie from August 
through October 1999, defense attorney Marty Singer told The Associated 
Press.

'This
 was Bryan's first studio film,' Marty Singer said. 'Clearly, he's not 
going to take a break in the middle of this movie while you're shooting 
and prepping it to go to Hawaii.'

X-Men
 was released in July 2000. Singer has directed three films in the 
blockbuster franchise, including the fifth installment, X-Men: Days of 
Future Past,  as well as other films including The Usual Suspects.

His
 lawyer said the director was never interviewed by any authorities about
 the claims made by Egan, who has said that he reported the Los Angeles acts 
and doesn't know why charges were not pursued.

Days 
after filing the suit against Singer, Egan filed additional 
suits against former BBC Worldwide America president Garth Ancier, 
former Disney TV president David Neuman and theme park design firm head 
Gary Goddard.

Attorneys for Goddard called the charges 'without merit,' while David Neuman addressed the charges in a series of tweets, calling them 'completely false' and 'shocking'.

Egan
 appeared at a news conference last month alongside his mother and sex 
abuse attorney Jeff Herman at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills.

'Hollywood
 adults are armed with something other adults aren’t armed with,' said 
Herman. 'It’s a tremendous amount of power...the power and influence to 
really make kids careers.'

Herman said that he's already got witnesses to the crimes waiting in the wings.

One reporter asked Egan what he had to say to his alleged abusers.

Scandalous: Now that director Bryan Singer is embroiled in two teen sexual assault lawsuits, someone still has to go out and promote X-Men: Days of Future Past

'You
 won't have another chance to hurt another child,' he said as his mother
 wept beside him. 'And for the people who have been abused, please come 
forward.'

The lawsuit was filed under a Hawaii law that temporarily suspends the statute of limitations in sex abuse cases. The law has led to several lawsuits against clergy members and others.

MailOnline does not typically name 
victims of sex abuse but is naming Egan because he is speaking publicly 
about his allegations.

A judge in Hawaii set a July 21 scheduling hearing in Honolulu for the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday
