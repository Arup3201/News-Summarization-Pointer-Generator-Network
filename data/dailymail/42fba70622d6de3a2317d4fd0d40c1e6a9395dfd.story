A salon owner has been fined £3,600 after six teenage girls were left with puss-filled pimples all over their body following a visit to a bacteria-infested spa pool for a birthday party.

Lisa Matthews was found to have been negligent after the girls contracted a 'horrendous' infection caused by harmful bacteria which had festered around the tiles of her poorly-maintained spa.

The teenagers, who had visited the Kensington Salon and Spa in Swadlincote, Derbyshire for the special occasion, ended up contracting folliculitis - an infection which causes hair follicles to swell into pus-filled pimples.

The girls were also left with painful, itchy rashes, while four of the victims complained of severe earache following the visit. 

Environmental health officers found the spa was 'significantly contaminated' with pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacteria often related to spa pools.

In some area, they found the bacteria was at 24,000 times the acceptable level. 

Inspectors from South Derbyshire District Council revealed how testing records had not been updated for more than a year and that there was a 'lack of maintenance' at the spa.

Following the court case, investigators revealed how there was limescale on shower heads, as well as bacteria breeding around missing tiles on the spa

Ms Matthews pleaded guilty at Derby Magistrates' Court to six charges of failing to ensure the safety of her customers and employees. 

She had previously been served with a notice to address these issues before continuing to trade.

Following the court case, investigators revealed how there was limescale on shower heads, as well as bacteria breeding around missing tiles on the spa.

A report also found the tap to the foot spa was broken and that more than 100 mosaic tiles were missing from in and around the spa. 

Today, Lyndsey Watson told how her daughter Jemma came out in a 'huge rash' after the part in May 2013. 

The teenage girls had been enjoying a birthday outing when they fell ill from the bacteria 

Magistrates said they were satisfied Ms Matthews had not done anything deliberately in breach of the health and safety legislation but that she had been negligent. Pictured: The salon and spa

Most of the skin is covered with tiny hairs which grow out of hair follicles.

Folliculitis means an inflammation or infection of the hair follicles. 

The affected hair follicles swell into pus-filled pimples, known as pustules.

Each individual pimple looks like a small, rounded, yellow-red spot. 

Mild cases often resolve without treatment but sometimes, antibiotic creams or tablets are needed.

The condition - sometimes referred to as 'Hot Tub Folliculitis' can affect people who use hot tubs frequently. 

The hot water encourages germs bacteria to grow, particularly if there is not enough chlorine in the water to keep it clean.

Bathing in this 'soup' of bacteria can increase your risk of folliculitis.

The most common site affected is the beard area of men.

Other common sites for folliculitis are the arms, legs, armpits and buttocks.

She said: 'The rash which this caused was horrendous and it was all over her body. It was a total nightmare to see it like that, you never want to see your children go through that.'  

Matt Holford, environmental health manager, said it was 'crucial' for spas to carry out water tests regularly.

He said: 'A variety of infectious agents are associated with the recreational use of water and these can affect the skin, ears, eyes, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.

'Thankfully in this case the council's prompt action prevented other people from falling ill with what can be a potentially very serious condition.' 

Magistrates said they were satisfied Ms Matthews had not done anything deliberately in breach of the health and safety legislation but that she had been negligent.

They added that her duty of care to her employees and customers and had fallen well below the expected standard. 

She was fined £2,500 and told to pay a further £1,000 in costs and £120 to her victims.

Nobody from the spa was available for comment.
