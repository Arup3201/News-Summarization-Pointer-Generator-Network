The red-brick home that starred in Steel Magnolias has gone up for auction - and the buyer will also get its haul of antiques and furniture too

Bonnette Auctions, who are handling the sale, describe it as 'One of the most valuable & desirable properties in Natchitoches Parish used in the film Steel Magnolias.'

The lucky bidder will also get antiques, high end furnishings, and movie memorabilia in the sale, as the property comes with the entire contents inside it.

Not only will the buyer be able to re-enact the moments where the characters laughed and cried; from Shelby's wedding to Jackson Jr's first birthday, they will be able to snap up all the contents inside.

Included in the sale are a four-poster bed, an 1860's marble top table, poster bed, oil paintings, rugs, bronzes and an elaborate fountain.

The house was on the market last year at prices ranging from $1.175 million to $949,000

The buyer will also get a haul of garden ornaments, sofas, a book case, lamps, porcelain, cut glass, china, crystal, clocks, stained glass, writing desks, dressers and a Victorian pump organ, Bonnette Auctions said.

The red-brick home was built in Natchitoches, near the Cane River, and was even used as a hospital during the Civil War, the LA Times reported.  

The house, which in recent years has been used as a bed and breakfast, was on the market last year at prices ranging from $1.175 million to $949,000. 

Guests often watch the film inside the house, the owners say, and like to walk around and see where certain scenes were filmed.

Steel Magnolias focused on the loves and tragedies of a close knit circle of friends - with many scenes featuring around the red brick home

Steel Magnolias became a classic as fans loved its heart-wrenching drama and leading ladies

Steel Magnolias starred Shirley Maclaine, Dolly Parton, Olympia Dukakis, Sally Field, Julia Roberts and Daryl Hannah

The owners have decorated each room in honour of the characters - from girly pink for Julia Roberts' character Shelby, to putting waspish battle-axe Ouiser in the attic.

The film is based in a small parish town in Lousiana, with a group of friends gathering around Truvy's (Dolly Parton) Beauty Parlor.

It follows the dreams, tragedies and celebrations of the group, from the death of loved ones to new romances.

The house became a focal point for the film, and many scenes were set there.

Film buffs from as far as Australia have visited the set to stay in the themed rooms and tour the small town which was a strong feature of the Deep South film.
