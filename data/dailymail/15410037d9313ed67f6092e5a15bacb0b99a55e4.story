Tragic: David Evans, 23, was crushed to death by a two-ton block of limestone while renovating the home of former Pizza Express boss, Hugh Osmond

The family of a builder who was crushed to death by a two-ton block of limestone spoke of their grief today as the masonry firm he worked for was convicted of corporate manslaughter.

David Evans, 23, was struck by the huge rock while renovating the sprawling £20million home of former Pizza Express boss, Hugh Osmond, near Moulsford, Oxfordshire.

He was airlifted to hospital with 'catastrophic injuries' to his chest and abdomen, but was pronounced dead later the same day.

Earlier today, Cavendish Masonry Limited, who employed Mr Evans, was found guilty of corporate manslaughter by a jury at Oxford Crown Court.

The court heard that the firm had committed a gross breach in its duty of care in its management and organisation of the work on Mr Osmond's 1,200-acre Well Barn Estate.

It had failed to take reasonable care in the planning and execution of those activities, the jury concluded.

And now, Mr Evans's family have spoken of their heartbreak over the death of their relative, whom they have described as 'profoundly honest' with an 'infectious laugh'.

In a statement, they said: 'We
 miss his smile, his infectious laugh and his profoundly honest nature. 
Not a single day passes without us thinking of him and wondering what 
his life and our lives would have been like were he here today.

'While
 we know that this trial will not bring David back to us, we now know 
how and why he was taken from us, how and why his promising life was cut
 so tragically short and how and why he will never be able to fulfil the
 potential that so many have attested to him having.

'We hope that this trial and the conclusions that are reached serve as an example to others in the industry.'

Mr Evans, from Tilehurst, Reading, had been building a 'rustic wall' on Mr Osmond's estate after being taken 
on by Cavendish Masonry as a stonemason’s mate because he was a good worker.

He was struck by the limestone slab and pinned to a set of stairs for five to 20 seconds after it 
toppled from its lintel as it was being 
lifted into place by a crane on February 9, 2010.

The
 worker was treated at the scene by colleagues by paramedics, before 
being airlifted to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. However, he was 
pronounced dead later that day.

At
 an earlier trial, prosecutors alleged the strops on the crane had been 
slackened off - meaning the limestone had been held in place by only its own weight.

They also described the rock as being like 'an 
enormous free-standing bathroom tile'.

'Honest': Mr Evans's family have spoken of their relative's 'profoundly honest' nature and 'infectious laugh'

Oliver Glasgow, prosecuting, told the jury: 'The decision had been taken not to use any 
fixings to hold the stone in place, therefore when the strops [a short 
rope whose ends are spliced together to make a ring] on the crane were 
slackened off, the only thing that held it there was its own weight.

'Since
 it was top-heavy and its width was not uniform and it was balanced on 
two concrete blocks, it was inevitable it would topple.'

He
 said tests on the block had found that because 
of its irregular shape, only a matter of millimetres which could 
decide whether it was stable or not.

'The specialist inspectors from Health and Safety Executive considered the absence of restraint as being very serious,' he said.

'They
 identified fixing the stones in place before the strops were let off 
was an essential part of the operation and absence was a significant 
error.

'It was 
concluded this was a result of a complete lack of planning and the work 
of Cavendish Masonry fell significantly below the standard expected of 
someone carrying out such a lifting operation.'

Mr Glasgow added: 'It would appear no real thought or planning had gone into the operation itself.

'Cavendish
 Masonry did almost nothing to ensure the lifting operation was done 
safely. The dangers it posed were obvious and they had been alerted by 
an email from the architect.'

The work on the 1,200-acre country estate included demolishing the 
estate manager’s home, a cottage, garages and a barn - and replacing them with a
 new family home.

A timber barn was also being converted into an indoor pool, gym and office, with an underground garage.

After
 Mr Evans’ death, Mr Osmond, a former Pizza Express director, released a statement, saying: 'It is a 
deeply tragic accident and we are obviously very shocked about it. All 
our thoughts go out to the man’s family and friends.'

The tycoon amassed his estimated £350million fortune through Punch Taverns and Pizza Express.

Following today's verdict, HSE 
Inspector Peter Snelgrove, who supported the police-led investigation, 
said: 'David Evans' tragic death was completely avoidable had Cavendish 
Masonry Limited properly planned and managed the installation of the 
heavy limestone.'

Cavendish Masonry Ltd is due to be sentenced at Oxford Crown Court on a date yet to be fixed.
