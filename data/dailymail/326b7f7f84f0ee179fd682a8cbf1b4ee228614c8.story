A newborn baby girl with the umbilical cord still attached was abandoned on the doorstep of a stranger’s house.

The frantic woman placed a call to 911 after noticing the umbilical cord around her, saying ‘This baby is going to die out here on the street!’

Moments earlier, the baby’s mother, 27-year-old Shoshannah Muhammad allegedly placed her in the woman’s arms saying, ‘You can have her, I don’t want her.’

It's going to die! Lydia Romero, left, frantically called 911 after the baby's mother dumped her newborn in her arms

The neighbour, 56-year-old Lydia Romero,
who lives in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights neighbourhood, placed the call 
after she saw the umbilical cord around the baby’s tiny body.

‘She had the umbilical cord wrapped around her,’ Ms Romero told ABC 7, adding that the baby was faintly crying and turning blue.

‘I said, “Oh my God! I can’t do this!”’

The Good Samaritan then called 911, saying: 'This baby is going to die out here in the street. She has a white pillow case on her head. The baby is in a thin blanket. This baby’s umbilical cord is at least over a foot long. This thing was not born in no d**n hospital.'

Three paramedics rushed to the scene.

When they arrived, the baby had no pulse and was turning blue. ‘It was lifeless, it was limp, it had no muscle tone, blue skin colour,’ FDNY paramedic Carl Gandolfo told reporters at a press conference.

He explained: ‘I immediately opened the airway, gave two rescue breaths, and the baby began to cry.’

He said his partner then arrived with an ambulance. The newborn was taken to Kings County Hospital and is said to be in good condition.

Mr Gandolfo said this case hit home for him. ‘I have a 15-month-old of my own at home. It definitely hits home when you get a pediatric call, especially when you find out you have a newborn who’s not breathing, that’s blue.

'This baby is going to die out here in the street. The baby is in a thin blanket. This baby’s umbilical cord is at least over a foot long. This thing was not born in no d**n hospital.'

‘You want to do everything you can,’ he said.

Amina DeLeon also placed a call to 911 after she encountered Muhammad in a nearby grocery store, NY1 reports.

She convinced a UPS delivery man to call 911 from his phone to alert the EMS.

Muhammad disappeared after abandoning her daughter in Ms Romero’s arms with a few Pampers and some toys. She was arrested March 16, officers said.

The 27-year-old mother was charged with acting in a manner injurious to a child.
