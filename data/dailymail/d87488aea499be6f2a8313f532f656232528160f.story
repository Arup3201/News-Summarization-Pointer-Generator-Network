While some parents might find this method unusual, for Walter Piper's son Christian it appears to be a very effective alarm clock.

In a recently posted YouTube video, Piper is seen putting his smart phone over his son's head as 'Runaway Baby' plays from the phone's speaker.

The adorable boy gets up right away and starts an adorable little dance routine right there in his crib.

Though Christian can't even talk in complete sentences, that hasn't stopped him from learning some dance moves. In the video, Christians starts out by shaking his bottom in he air, a huge smile on his face. He then transitions to throwing his hands up in the air before the 30-second video ends.

Although the video was posted about a week ago, it has already generated more than 352,000 hits.

And Piper says this method of waking up Christian is now a standard part of his baby's regimen. 'This is how we wake up my son every moorning.' Piper posted on the YouTube page with the video. 'ENJOY!'
