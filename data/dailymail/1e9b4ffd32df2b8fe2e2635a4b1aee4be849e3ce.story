A Pennsylvania architect says that two years ago airport security threw him in a jail cell for 23 hours because he wished to file a complaint when his search was taking too long, said a lawsuit for $75,000 in damages filed last week.

Roger Vanderklok was at a security checkpoint at Philadelphia International Airport on January 26, 2013 hoping to fly to Miami to run a half-marathon when security mistook his Power Bars and his watch for a bomb and explosive device.

Vanderklok claims that he complained when TSA official Charles Kieser and other staff searched his bag for 30 minutes without telling him what they were searching for.  

Lawsuit: Roger Vanderklok, who was detained for 23 after a search of energy bars and a sports watch in his carry-on bag at Philadelphia International Airport, has sued the Transportation Security Administration

Confusion: TSA workers initially thought that the power bar in Vanderklok's bag along with a heart-monitoring watch were a possible explosive device 

Philly.com reports that the employees asked him what a tube shaped item in his bag was to which he replied his heart-monitoring watch.

Vanderklok claims that TSA Staff then went on to ask him if he had any ‘organic matter’ in his bag meaning food.

Vanderklok who thought ‘organic matter’ meant just fruit and vegetables said no.

Power Bars  are considered organic matter because they are made with milk, grain, and sugar.

They also vaguely resemble a common homemade explosive.

TSA agents believed that the watch may have been the item used to detonate a bomb which they thought might be the Power Bar.

Vanderklok said that airport staff later deemed his items harmless and that's when he asked to file a complaint because the search took a long time and they failed to communicate with him effectively.

He said that had someone told him what they meant by 'organic matter' the search would not have taken as long as it did.

That's when Vanderklok was allegedly escorted to a holding cell without any explanation as to why he was there.

He was later arraigned at 2 a.m. on 'threatening the placement of a bomb' and making 'terroristic threats,' according to Philly.com.

Scared for his life: 'I was scared to death. I have never been arrested in my life, never had handcuffs put on,' Vanderklok said of the traumatic experience

'I was scared to death. I have never been arrested in my life, never had handcuffs put on,' Vanderklok said.

'Throughout the night, I was in a dark place; no one knew where I was. I thought, "I could fall off the face of the earth right now, and no one would know it." '

Kieser told the court following the arrest that Vanderklok was detained because he became agitated and told TSA agents while pointing his finger, 'I'll bring a bomb through here any day I want … you'll never find it.'

Vanderklok repeated the aggressive finger-pointing two more times, Kieser testified.

Vanderklok was only released after his wife shelled out 10% of his $40,000 bail.

Philly.com reports that surveillance footage of the interaction shows no conflict or any evidence of finger pointing.

Bailed him out: Vanderklok wasn't released from his 23 hour fiasco until his wife Eleanor bailed him out by paying 10 per cent of his $40,000 bail 

The surveillance footage shows no sign of distress by TSA employees either.

They can be seen chatting with one another, checking their cell phones, and sipping on soda.

Kiesler's story changed when spoke with police  and when he testified.

He told police that Vanderklok became agitated and said 'Anybody could bring a bomb in here and nobody would know.'

Kiesler in court said that Vanderklok threatened them with a bomb directly.  

Surveillance foitage proved that Kielser was lying and a judge acquitted Vanderklok of all charges.
