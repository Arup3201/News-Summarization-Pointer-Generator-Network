A suspected drug trafficker who was captured by Guatemalan police has been humiliated after armed officers paraded him around an Air Force base without a shirt or shoes.

Jairo Orellana, known as El Pelon or the 'Bald One', was arrested in his hometown of Dona Maria Gualan, roughly 90 miles east of Guatemala City, after a shootout that left three dead.

The 40-year old, who has ties to the powerful Mexican cartel Los 
Zetas, is on a list of Central American drug kingpins and is accused of shipping large amounts of cocaine to the US.

Embarrassed: Jairo Orellana, 40, known as El Pelon or The 'Bald One' was paraded around an Air Force base in Guatemala City without a shirt after being captured by police

As he touched down at the base in Guatemala City, he was dragged from a helicopter by armed guards and was shown off to waiting cameras at a news conference. 

Two of his security guards and one police officer were killed in the clash, while eight other alleged members of Orellana's gang were also arrested.

After he was apprehended, Orellana was taken to the capital for his first hearing and now faces extradition to the US.

Authorities placed him on a list of Central American drug kingpins, prohibiting US citizens from doing business with him.

He narrowly escaped a brazen attempt on his life in 2012 when gunmen, disguised as police officers, attacked a health clinic in the capital city, killing seven men.

The small Central American nation of roughly 15 million people is one of the world's most violent and the government has struggled to contain powerful drug gangs.

Orellana was captured as authorities in Mexico arrested a man suspected of being the main migrant smuggler for the Zetas cartel.

Fernando Martinez Magana, 42, is accused of coordinating the smuggling of Mexican and Central American migrants into the United States from his base in Nuevo Laredo, across the border from Texas, said federal police chief Monte Alejandro Rubido.

Martinez Magana was arrested in the northern city of Monterrey, where he had fled to as authorities closed in, said Rubido.

The Nuevo Laredo-native is also wanted in the US, where investigators say his criminal cell kept dozens of migrants in stash houses or apartments across San Antonio.

Martinez Magana had replaced a Zetas leader in Nuevo Laredo who was arrested in December 2011 and took over his nickname of 'Z16,' Rubido said.
