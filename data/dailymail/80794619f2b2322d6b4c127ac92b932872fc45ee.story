A family of six woke up early Wednesday morning to discover their suburban Detroit home engulfed in flames after being firebombed.

The attack on the house of Linda Bazzi in Dearborn Heights took place at around 12.30am and was caught on surveillance video, which captured the moment a man ran up to the residence, hurled a Molotov cocktail through the front window and fled on foot.

For Bazzi, her husband and their four children, the first sign that something was amiss was that their house felt unusually warm.

Under attack: A surveillance camera outside a home in Dearborn Heights, Michigan, captured the moment a man ran up to the residence carrying a Molotov cocktail

Fire starter: The suspect hurled the firebomb through the front window of the two-story home 

Inferno: The flammable liquid sparked a blaze inside the house, where a family of six slept 

When Bazzi's husband left their bedroom and went downstairs to check, he discovered a raging inferno ravaging their first floor.

‘He screamed at the top of the lungs, “Get the kids! The house is on fire!"’ Bazzi told the station Click On Detroit.

The homeowners and their four children were able to escape unharmed, but their two-story home on Charlesworth Street has been rendered uninhabitable.

Despite losing all her possessions, Linda Bazzi is grateful.

Targeted: The homeowners and local police believe that ti was no random act of violence 

On the run: The suspect fled the scene on foot and still remains at large 

‘Everything can be replaced, but I'm so happy, I'm so blessed that they didn't win: I have my children and I have my husband next to me,’ Bazzi said.

After watching the surveillance footage from the night of the firebombing, the family came way believing they had been targeted.

‘I'm scared for my life right now,' Mrs Bazzi told the station.

Police in Dearborn Heights also do not believe it was a random act of violence.

A relative of the family had his house firebombed four months ago, and investigators are now trying to determine if the two incidents are somehow linked. 

Aftermath: Linda Bazzi, her husband and four children were able to escape the house fire unharmed 

All is lost: Mrs BAzzi said the attack destroyed all her possessions and left their house in ruins 

Possible pattern: A relative of the family had his house firebombed four months earlier 

Neighbors told MyFox Detroit that someone tried to firebomb another house on the corner recently, suggesting that the Wednesday night incident that left Linda Bazzi's home in shambles may have been a case of mistaken identity.

Local police say they are investigating potential suspects.

Meanwhile, Linda Bazzi and her family have moved in with relatives.
