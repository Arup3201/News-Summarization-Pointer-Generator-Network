John Terry has admitted he is fighting for his family’s financial future as he waits for Chelsea to activate a one-year contract extension.

Terry, 34, scored Chelsea’s opening goal in the 2-0 victory over Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday and was later named man of the match.

The Chelsea captain  posted pictures of his eight-year-old twins, Georgie John and Summer Rose, asleep in bed with the cup between them. His son was also wearing his dad’s winner’s medal.

‘I am fighting for my future, for my family’s future and I want to give it everything,’ said Terry.

‘I don’t know how long I have left. Hopefully I have a few years left but if this is my last year then I hope I will go out on a bang.’ Terry also revealed he will retire at the top and will not play at a lower level, or for another team, when he leaves Stamford Bridge.

Terry said: ‘The manager came in, sat me down, and made it clear that if you work hard you will get extra years and you will play, but if not there are other players who are younger who can play and will fight for their place. This is a year roll-on. I am fighting for myself and my family, and to prove people wrong. It doesn’t come much bigger than that.’

Terry says Mourinho told him he would get a new deal if he worked hard and was worth his place in the side

Chelsea have already indicated they will address his £150,000-a-week contract before the end of the season and Jose Mourinho has admitted it is a ‘formality’.

Terry added: ‘I also think there’s a right time to go as well. I would say at the start of my career, as a player you look at it and you want to get to 35... I have my little target to play next year but beyond that, two or three years.’

The defender also ruled out a return to the England team despite calls for him to come out of international retirement.

‘No (I won’t return),’ he said. ‘It’s the simple answer. I don’t want to go into it right now... but it’s never crossed my mind. I have drawn a line under it and the England squad can move on now.’
