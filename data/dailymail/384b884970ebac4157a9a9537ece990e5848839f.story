Widely sold across the US, the products have injured at least 92 babies - based on complaints filed with the agency - as a result of them hanging and/or falling out of them, according to the filing.

Four infants died in the Nap Nanny Generation Two recliners, a fifth died in the Chill model, according to the filing.
