From models backstage at London Fashion 
Week to grannies in their retirement homes, everybody has been taking 
part in the newest internet dance phenomenon - the Harlem Shake.

Now, Harry Rodrigues, aka DJ Baauer, the man behind the trap music track, admits that it has developed a life of its own, with the video tributes collectively generating 175million views to date.

The 23-year-old, who was born in West Philadelphia but is based in New York, said in a Q & A with Reddit users: 'The viral craze was something totally out of my control.
 I see it really positively.'

Internet dance sensation: Harry Rodrigues, aka DJ Baauer, the man behind trap music track Harlem Shake, admits that it has developed a life of its own, with video tributes collectively generating 175million views

In an interview with The Daily Beast, he elaborated further: 'All I did was make the song so it’s kind of a weird place for me 
to be at,' he said. 'I birthed it, it was raised by others, and now it’s like my 
weird, f***ed up adopted teenage kid coming back to me.'

Baauer, who at one point lived in Harlem, says the name of the track is not intended to be a tribute to the dance of the same name, nor his time in the Uptown neighborhood.

Instead, he explained, it references a line in Plastic Little’s Miller Time, 'then do the Harlem Shake', which Baauer's track samples.

'It just got stuck in my head for a while, so I used it,' he said.

The Harlem Shake was originally released in May 2012, but the phenomenon 
apparently began on January 30th, when one video blogger posted a video 
of himself and three others dressed in colorful latex suits dancing to 
the song.

Baauer says he himself noticed that his 
track had sparked an internet craze around a week-and-a-half ago, when 
fans started posting YouTube links to his Facebook fan page.

'I thought, "Oh, that’s funny." But it didn’t strike me as the beginning
 of something'

In the 30-second videos, one person - who is usually wearing a bizarre  mask or costume - is seen dancing unnoticed to Harlem Shake, a song by DJ Baauer.

Then
 when the bass line drops, the video suddenly shows everyone in the 
frame going crazy, forming a wild and chaotic dance party.

'I thought, "Oh, that’s funny." But it didn’t strike me as the beginning
 of something,' he told The Daily Beast.

Since then, thousands of people of all ages and walks of life have created their own versions of the popular meme.

The Harlem Shake has been compared to Gagnam Style, Korean pop star Psy's 2012 internet dance craze.

Of his favorite Harlem Shake tributes, Baauer told Reddit that 'the underwater one is pretty great,' also citing the T-Pain version as another of his top takes on the track.

One that was less well-received was one by rapper Azealia Banks, who released - and then forced to retract - a remix of Harlem Shake without the permission of his label, Mad Decent.

The debacle sparked a Twitter war between the two artists, a situation Baauer says he is 'not happy about'.

'She had a version that we were 
going to release because I’m a big fan of hers... and it was 
so/so. Didn’t love it,' he explained.

'That was a little while ago, and since all 
this video stuff happened, our plans all changed... So 
we told her, "Please don’t release your version." And she said, "Well, 
I’m going to put it online anyway."'

Party time: Members of the community look bored, before breaking into the Harlem Shake

Unlike 2012's most popular internet 
dance craze, inspired by PSY's Gangnam Style, the Harlem Shake does not 
involve any specific 
dance moves and is instead more of a free-for-all, often leading
 to hilarious results.

In one video, a troop of Norwegian soldiers is seen lining up in formation.

One
 of the soldiers begins dancing, and 20 seconds into the video the other
 soldiers - who are suddenly wearing skis, standing on their heads or 
wrapped up in sleeping bags on the ground - join in on the dance.

Another
 video sees the crew and animals of San Antonio Sea World, all bopping 
their heads and shaking their fins to the beat of the tune.

Many sports teams have also put out their own versions of the meme.

In
 a unique take on the video, the University of Georgia's swim team took 
their camera under water to film their dance routine.

The video sees the team sitting around a table at the bottom of a swimming pool.

One swimmer wearing a Star Wars storm trooper helmet begins to dance, and then a group of his teammates suddenly joins in.

At Clark Retirement Community, senior citizens bravely attempted their own adaptation of the dance.

A video shows members of the community looking bored in the lobby, before they break out in a frenzy of smiles and dance moves.

Celebrities have also tried their hand at the dance.

Backstage at London Fashion Week, models Cara Delevingne and Jourdan Dunn whip their hair to the catchy tune.

And T-Pain posted his own take on the meme.

In his video, which appears to take place in a game room in the rapper's home, T-Pain starts out by hula-hooping to the beat of the song.

But
 when the beat comes in, a dancing crowd appears in the room, and the 
rapper - suddenly wearing a marching band outfit - busts a move in the center of the group.

Even the Sports Illustrated swimsuit models have produced their own version of the dance.

In the video, blonde bombshell Kate Upton takes the lead as the girls bust a move under a Las Vegas sign.

Baauer, who is set to perform at a 
number of U.S. festivals this summer, thanks to his success, says he is 
appreciative of the recognition he has received in the videos.

He wrote on Reddit: 'At the end of 
the day lots of new people are listening to my music,' he wrote. 'I'm 
hoping that my music will speak for itself.'
