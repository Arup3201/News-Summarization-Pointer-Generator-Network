Social media-savvy holidaymakers are in luck.

A hotel in Sweden is offering  accommodation to those with a high number of Facebook friends and Instagram followers.

Boutique The Nordic Light Hotel in Stockhol has launched a 'Social Network as Currency' promotion giving travellers from 10 per cent off the price off a room - usually costing around £230. 

The Nordic Light Hotel in Stockholm has just introduced their 'Your Social Network as Currency' promotion

For those who are especially savvy on social media, you may be eligible for a free stay at this Swedish hotel

Anyone with either 100,000 followers on Instagram, 2,000 private Facebook friends or 100,000 on a fan page, will be gifted seven nights per year at the hotel  free.

The  catch is that, in return, the hotel expects social media publicity 

As a visitor, you must share a post when making the reservation, then again at check-in and one at check-out.

The post must mention the hotel's website and Facebook page. 

Those who have  100,000 Instagram followers can redeem seven free nights per year at the hotel

If you have  2,000 private Facebook friends, similar rules apply. But there are conditions to your stay...

You will also be required to like the hotel's Facebook page and tag yourself in your check-in and check-out posts.

For those on Instagram, similar rules apply. 

In all posts, guests must use #nordiclighthotel and tag Nordic Light Hotel when you're there and have checked-in. 

All social savvy travellers must check-in and post regularly about the hotel and include relevant hashtags

100,000 fans or more = 100% discount

2,000 private friends or more = 100% discount

1,500 private friends or more = 15% discount

1,000 private friends or more = 10% discount

500 private friends or more = 5% discount

100,000 followers or more = 100% discount

15,000 followers or more = 15% discount

10,000 followers or more = 10% discount

5,000 followers or more = 5% discount

If these conditions are not met, the discount will be cancelled.

And for guests who are not quite so popular on social media, but have still amassed a respectable amount of followers and fans, The Nordic Light Hotel will still offer a discount.

As few as 5,000 fans on Instagram will land you 5 per cent  off your stay, while 1,000 private Facebook friends will see 10 per cent knocked off.
