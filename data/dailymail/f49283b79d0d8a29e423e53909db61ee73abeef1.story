Crystal Palace will enquire about a deal for Manchester United winger Wilfried Zaha once Tony Pulis returns from media work in Brazil.

Zaha came through the ranks at Selhurst Park and played more than 100 games before his £15miilion move to Old Trafford in January 2013.

Bench warmer: Wilfried Zaha made just two Premier League appearances for United last season

The 21-year-old remained on loan with the Eagles for the rest of the campaign before returning to United for pre-season training.

Zaha had to wait until December to make his Premier League debut for the Reds before being shipped out on loan to Cardiff city for the second half of the campaign.

A flurry of new signings are expected this summer following the appointment of Louis van Gaal as boss.

And Eagles chief Pulis is ready to make a move to bring England U21 ace Zaha back for another stint in south-east London.
