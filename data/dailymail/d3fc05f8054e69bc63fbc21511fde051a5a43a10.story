Scientists have created the first viable alternative to antibiotics, marking the next step in the fight against drug-resistant superbugs

Scientists have created the first viable alternative to antibiotics, marking the next step in the fight against drug-resistant superbugs.

A small test study has found the new drug is effective at targeting the bacteria that causes MRSA.

Researchers believe the likelihood of the bug developing a resistance to the new drug is 'very limited'.

A version of the drug is already used in specialist creams to treat conditions including acne, eczema, rosacea and skin irritations.

Dutch biotech firm Micreos claims Staphefekt is the first endolysin - a bacteria-killing enzyme - available for use on human skin.  

While targeting MRSA and other strains of bacteria resistant to antibiotics, the drug's make up means it leaves 'good' bacteria unharmed - important in the case of long-term use.

The firm unveiled its discovery at the EuroSciCon meeting, Antibiotics Alternatives for the New Millenium, in London yesterday.

CEO Mark Offerhaus hailed it as a 'new era in the fight against antibiotic resistant bacteria', and said 'millions of people stand to benefit'.

MRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, is a potentially deadly bacteria which causes serious infections of the skin, blood, lungs and bones.

It is resistant to antibiotics and poses a serious threat in hospitals and nursing homes. 

Across the EU and USA the death toll runs to nearly 50,000 a year, inducing healthcare costs of around £14billion, according to the World Health Organisation.

Such is the concern over antibiotic resistance that earlier this year, Prime Minister David Cameron warned of the 'very real and worrying threat' that could send medicine 'back to the dark ages'.

In May, chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies echoed health secretary Jeremy Hunt's concerns, warning resistance of antibiotics is one of the greatest threats to modern health.

Staphefekt is based on naturally occurring enzymes called endolysins, which are found in viruses and kill bacteria.

Endolysins originate from bacteriophages (phages) - microorganisms that target bacteria. 

In nature, phages use bacteria to replicate, in the process destroying the bacterial cell wall with endolysins.

The working mechanism is very different to that of antibiotics, meaning even strains of bacteria resistant to antibiotics are susceptible to the new drug. 

Staphefekt exhibits several other characteristics including rapid killing of the target bacteria.

And the likelihood of emerging resistance to the drug is 'very limited', because it works independent of the bacterial metabolism - which harbours the ability to resist - and targets a region of the bacterial cell wall less susceptible to mutation.

In addition the drug has been found to only target specific bacteria, leaving those beneficial strains unharmed.

Addressing the World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland, Dame Sally said: 'If we don't take action, in 20 years' time we could be back in the 19th century where infections kill us as a result of routine operations.'

Last month Dame Sally put the threat in perspective, warning it is 'as big as terrorism', and could result in minor scratches or routine operations becoming fatal. 

The new drug is based on naturally occurring enzymes called endolysins, which are found in viruses and kill bacteria in a different way to antibiotics.  

In an observational study, Staphefekt killed MRSA in five out of six people suffering skin conditions including dermatitis and eczema. 

Clinical biologist Dr Bjorn Herpers told the conference: 'The results are exciting, and demonstrate the potential this technology has to revolutionise the way we treat certain bacterial infections.

'With the increasing prevalence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria, new strategies for the treatment of bacterial infections are needed. 

'As well as being less prone to resistance induction than antibiotics, endolysins (enzymes) destroy only their target bacterial species, leaving the beneficial bacteria alone.'

The ability of the new drug to leave beneficial unharmed is also a major step forward.

A side-effect of broad spectrum antibiotics is that they can change the body's normal microbial content by attacking indiscriminately both the pathological and naturally occurring, beneficial or harmless bacteria, found in the intestines, lungs and bladder.

The destruction of the body's normal bacterial flora can provide an opportunity for drug-resistant micro-organisms to grow, leading to secondary infections including Clostridium difficile, and thrush. 

Brendan Wren, an expert in infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told The Times: 'We are all aware that the post-antibiotic apocalypse is upon us, where we won't be able to use antibiotics because of resistance, and one could argue that this is more acute than concerns such as climate change. 

'We're so desperate for new alternatives and this one looks like it's at the leading edge.'

The firm is to conduct clinical trials of Staphefekt and is looking to expand them internationally.
