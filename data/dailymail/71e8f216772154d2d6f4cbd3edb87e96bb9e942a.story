Pam Corrigan, 77,  has fought breast cancer for 30 years and endured dozens of operations, treatments and drugs

A 77-year-old woman has spoken of her 30 year battle with breast cancer, in which she discovered a tumour almost every six years.

Pam Corrigan discovered her first tumour in 1984 and has since undergone a double mastectomy and countless rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

She has even had cancer in the scar tissue left by her mastectomy. 

Over the past three decades, she has lived through innovations in treatment for the disease and helped pioneer experimental drugs which have since become commonplace.

She has also raised more than £1 million for specialist treatment centres for breast cancer. 

Despite various different treatments, including three different drugs, her cancer has repeatedly returned over the decades.

Mrs Corrigan, an accountant who lives in Bristol, is now in remission from her latest bout of the disease last year - and remains stoic and positive about the future.

She said treatment of breast cancer has changed dramatically since the 1980s.

'When I was first diagnosed no one spoke about it. We would be kept on a general ward,' she said.

'There was no such thing as after care, it was more like 'we have done our job, that's it.

'No one was specially trained and although you could tell they wanted to do more for you, they had no training, so they were almost scared they would do something wrong.

'I remember going for check-ups in an old hospital and it had cubicles set up in a ward with just curtains around each area. You could hear everything that was being said.

'That was really hard, you didn't want to hear other people and you didn't want to make much of a fuss because you didn't want everybody else hearing about you.'

Mrs Corrigan was first diagnosed with cancer after she went to the doctors complaining of a pulled muscle around her breast.

Although medics suspected cancer it took weeks to formally identify the disease as the hospital had limited resources, including an old, inefficient scanner.

After six weeks she was finally given the diagnosis and was admitted to hospital for a lumpectomy to remove the tumour, followed by radiotherapy. 

In 1991, Mrs Corrigan set up the charity BUST, which has raised more than £1 million for specialist breast cancer treatment centres. At that time, breast cancer was treated on general wards by general surgeons. Mrs Corrigan is pictured here at a BUST fundraising ball

Tamoxifen is an anti-oestrogen drug that is widely used to treat breast cancer. It‘s occasionally used to treat some other cancers.

It binds to oestrogen receptors, cutting off the hormone so it can no longer feed the growth of cancer cells. 

A large new sutdy published last year found that  women with breast cancer that keeps coming back may be able to beat the disease by taking Tamoxifen for ten years after surgery.

Using tamoxifen for ten rather than five years halves the risk of women dying from the most common kind of breast cancer.

The study was described as a 'pivotal moment' in the fight against the disease. 

Just four years later doctors discovered another lump and Mrs Corrigan was told a single mastectomy was her only choice.

'Having breast cancer as a specific entity was still just part of general surgery, you weren't treated specifically because you had it,' she added.

In 1990, she was once more diagnosed with cancer when it developed in her scar tissue.

After her doctor 'cut it out and dragged the skin back together', she was put on the then revolutionary drug Tamoxifen.

This is used to treat breast cancer and occasionally other cancers. 

It binds to oestrogen receptors, cutting off the hormone so it can no longer feed the growth of cancer cells.

Despite being prescribed Tamoxifen, just a year later Mrs Corrigan was back in hospital again when doctors found the disease in her scar for the second time and she underwent surgery to reform her breast.

As she was recovering on the ward she met fellow sufferers Carol Thomas and Margaret Twiggs and they launched BUST, a charity to ensure specialist treatment could be given. 

All three had been shocked by the lack of support for breast cancer patients treated on general wards.

Mrs Corrigan remembers that on general wards, there was only a curtain around a woman's bed so everyone could hear their breast cancer diagnosis. She set up BUST so that specialist treatment centres with separate diagnosis rooms could be opened. Here, she is pictured (far right) at the opening of a centre in Bristol

They set about trying to help specialist surgeon Simon Cawthorn, who had taken an interest in breast cancer.

Mrs Corrigan said: 'We saw how much needed to be done and how good a surgeon Simon was. He seemed much more interested in breast cancer than anybody else.

'People thought you were just on a conveyor belt and the next patient would be along with a hernia or something else.

'He was much more committed to breast cancer, and we thought surely we could do something to make his job easier.'

'We built one of the first breast cancer care centre with a dedicated area and dedicated support nurses so you had a place to go when you didn't get the best news.

'We built the new unit with nice consulting rooms, to treat people in a much more caring way.' 

Sadly, her cancer returned yet again in 2000 where she had another mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

After being told she was in remission she developed more lumps six years later, and again in 2012.

She had surgery once again in September 2012 to remove her lymph nodes completely, and went back on drug Tamoxifen.

In July 2013. she underwent another bout of radiotherapy after doctors spotted a 'cancer hotspot' and it is hoped she is now, once more, in remission.

Mrs Corrigan said: 'I don't want people in their 40s developing cancer, thinking "Oh my gosh it's not going to go away", my case is unusual.

'If when I first had it and they had Tamoxifen or another drug there is every chance it would never have come back.

'My cancer is low grade so it would be easy to stop it, if the advances had been around at that time.'
