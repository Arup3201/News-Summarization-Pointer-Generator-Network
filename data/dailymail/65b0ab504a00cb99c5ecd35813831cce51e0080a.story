David Cameron called on Christians to be ‘more evangelical’ about their faith last night as he admitted he has felt the ‘healing power’ of the Church.

In an Easter article for the Church Times, the Prime Minister said Christians should be ‘more confident’ in talking up their beliefs.

Blending his faith and his pet political project the Big Society, Mr Cameron asked Christians to volunteer and ‘get out there and make a difference to people’s lives’.

Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured speaking at the Conservative Party Spring Forum in central London earlier this month, has said Britain should be 'more confident about our status as a Christian nation'

The Prime Minister insisted that 
being a Christian country did not mean 'doing down' other religions or 
'passing judgment' on those with no faith at all.

It
 comes after the Government came under attack from senior clergy over 
its welfare reforms, but Mr Cameron has responded by saying 'we all 
believe in many of the same principles' and that churches were 'vital 
partners'.

Mr Cameron described himself as a 'classic' member of the Church of England, 'not that regular in attendance, and a bit vague on some of the more difficult parts of the faith'.

And he rejected the idea that in an 'ever more secular age' people should not talk about their religion.

In his most robust words to date on the importance of religion in politics he said he wants to ‘infuse politics’ with Christian ‘ideals and values’ such as ‘hard work, charity, compassion, humility and love’.

'I believe we should be more confident about our status as a Christian country, more ambitious about expanding the role of faith-based organisations, and, frankly, more evangelical about a faith that compels us to get out there and make a difference to people's lives,' he said.

'First, being more confident about our status as a Christian country does not somehow involve doing down other faiths or passing judgment on those with no faith at all.'

Mr Cameron said he had 'felt at first
 hand the healing power of the Church's pastoral care' and Christians 
'know how powerful faith can be in the toughest of times' – comments 
that perhaps refer to the period when his eldest son Ivan died.

Earlier this year the Government came
 under attack from 27 Anglican bishops who warned that thousands of 
people were being forced to rely on hand-outs from food banks as a 
result of the coalition's benefit changes.

The leader of the Roman Catholic 
Church in England and Wales Cardinal Vincent Nichols has also said it 
was a 'disgrace' that in such a wealthy country there were people who 
could not afford to feed themselves.

'Many people tell me it is easier to be Jewish or Muslim in Britain than in a secular country precisely because the tolerance that Christianity demands of our society provides greater space for other religious faiths, too.

'Crucially, the Christian values of responsibility, hard work, charity, compassion, humility, and love are shared by people of every faith and none - and we should be confident in standing up to defend them.

'People who, instead, advocate some 
sort of secular neutrality fail to grasp the consequences of that 
neutrality, or the role that faith can play in helping people to have a 
moral code. Of course, faith is neither necessary nor sufficient for 
morality.

'Many atheists 
and agnostics live by a moral code - and there are Christians who don't.
 But for people who do have a faith, that faith can be a guide or a 
helpful prod in the right direction - and, whether inspired by faith or 
not, that direction or moral code matters.'

Mr Cameron acknowledged that welfare was 'controversial' but said 'not enough is made of our efforts to tackle poverty'

The Prime Minister, who has faced 
criticism from within his own party over the Government's commitment to 
spend 0.7 per cent of gross national income on overseas aid, said the 
policy should be a 'source of national pride'.

The article is the latest demonstration of Mr Cameron's religious faith.

At an Easter reception in Downing 
Street earlier this month he told an audience of Christian leaders and 
politicians in Downing Street that his 'moments of greatest peace' 
occurred every other Thursday morning attending the Eucharist at St Mary Abbots, the west London church linked to the school his children attend.

'I find a little bit of peace and hopefully a bit of guidance,' he added.
