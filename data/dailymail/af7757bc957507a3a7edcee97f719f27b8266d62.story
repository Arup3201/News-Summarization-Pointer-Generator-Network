Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus on Friday characterized Democrats' top presidential contenders as either too snooty or too handsy to manage the country while addressing conservatives at their annual gabfest and jubilee.

'They've got one candidate ready to coronate herself,' Priebus said, referring to former first lady Hillary Clinton. 'And they have a sitting vice president who can't control his mouth - or his hands - who's been running for president since before I could vote.'

The taunting of Biden follows an incident last week in which he got up close and personal with Defense Secretary Ash Carter's wife, Stephanie, while the new Pentagon chief was being sworn in.

Disparaging Democrats' prospects of winning the presidency in 2016, Priebus said, 'they have a sitting vice president who can't control his mouth - or his hands.' Priebus' taunting of Biden follows an incident last week in which the vice president got up close and personal with Defense Secretary Ash Carter's wife, Stephanie, while the new Pentagon chief was being sworn in

Biden put his hands on Carter's shoulders, groping her while he whispered in her ear.

The VP has a reputation for being flirty. A photo of him cozying up to a biker at a Ohio campaign spot went viral in 2012. He put his hands on her, too, and appeared to draw the ire of her male companions.

Attempting to energize conservatives ahead of next year's national election, Priebus said the right can win if it puts in the hard work.

Then 'we'll have a Republican President, and 1600 Pennsylvania avenue will never belong to the Clintons again,' he told his audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference, held just down the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. in National Harbor, Maryland.

Priebus warned that at Clinton presidency would be more of the same. 

'I can guarantee you America, you're not going to get something different than Obama with a member of the Obama administration,' he said. 'You're going to get a third term of Barack Obama.' 

To good news for Republicans, Priebus said, is the more voters hear from Hillary Clinton, the less they like her. 

Her approval rating was the highest when she was out of the country and off the campaign trail, he contended. 'True fact.' 

'That's probably why Hillary barely comes out in public these days,' he said. 'If there's not a private luxury jet, and a quarter million dollar speaking fee waiting for her, you can forget about it.'

The real reason Clinton has mostly kept out of the public eye in 2015 is because she 'doesn't have much to say,' he charged.

If you ask her press people for her opinion on issues of the day such as the Keystone XL Pipeline and the fight against ISIS, they say, 'no comment,' the GOP's top tongue wager told guests of CPAC.

'I'm sure Obama wishes Biden would follow that example.' 

Don't tell Jill!: Vice President Joe Biden has a reputation for being flirty with women other than his wife, Jill. He's pictured here getting up close and personal with a customer at a diner while on the campaign trail in 2012

Priebus joked today that after mixing up croute de te with an ethnic group the vice president would then 'rub your neck without permission'

At that point, roughly six minutes in to his remarks, Priebus interrupted himself to say: 'Oh and by the way, If I was Hillary Clinton, this speech would have have already cost you $20,000.'

Priebus used that line to launch into a lengthy parody of both Clinton and Biden.

'Hillary would never speak here,' he said. Not because she's a Democratic but because of her 'Hollywood style backstage demands' that are included in her speaking contracts.

'Well you know I checked back stage. There was insufficient croute de te, the water temperature was off by a few degrees, and I don't think that the lemon wedges were cut quite at the right angle,' he said.

He then asserted that Clinton, who last year attracted negative attention for noting that her family was 'dead broke' when it left the White House, has 'lost touch' with America.

Vice President Joe Biden is out of touch, Priebus said.

'If you asked Joe Biden what croute de te is, he'd probably say this: "Oh yeah I had a great relationship with that community. There's an awful lot of them driving cabs in Delaware, for real man, they're friends of mine."

'And then of course he'd rub your neck without permission,' Priebus added.

The remarks about cab drivers was a mockery of Biden's claim last week that a 'very identifiable' community of Somalis have made his hometown, Wilmington, Delaware, their home away from home.

'If you ever come to the train station with me you’ll notice I have great relationships with them because there’s an awful lot driving cabs and are friends of mine,' Biden said while speaking at the White House's counter terror summit. 'For real. I’m not being solicitous. I’m being serious.'

Hillary Clinton served as a punching bag throughout the day on Friday and speakers took turns beating her up to the delight of their conservative followers.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said she was a politician of 'yesterday.' Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said, 'It's time for Hillary Clinton to retire.'

Both men are contemplating presidential campaigns and could find themselves facing off with her in a general election in 2016. 

Questionnaires how she would easily win against any of the possible GOP candidates, but Paul and Rubio would fare the best against her, losing by seven points a piece, according to a Public Policy Polling survey released on Friday.
