Sainsbury’s is trying a radical approach as it attempts to reduce the environmental impact of transporting toilet rolls to its stores.

The supermarket chain is shrinking the diameter of the cardboard tubes inside its own-brand toilet paper.

Each roll will be 11 millimetres slimmer – 112mm instead of 123mm – while the number of sheets will remain as 240.

With each Briton getting through an average of 50 toilet rolls a year, supplying it involves huge costs and has a big impact on the environment.

Sainsbury’s claims the move will avoid 500 annual lorry trips from suppliers to stores and save 140 tons of carbon dioxide.

It insists customers will not struggle to squeeze the new toilet rolls onto holders.

Spokesman Kate Tucker said: ‘We wanted to shrink the tube as much as possible and this was as far as we could go to guarantee that it will still fit customers’ toilet roll holders.’

In the past, manufacturers including Andrex have made rolls last longer by increasing sheet numbers. But this is thought to be the first time that any firm has tried to change the size of the tube inside.

The new rolls will be go sale next month at the same price as before – £1.99 for four.

Miss Tucker said the change would give ‘an essential household product a lower carbon footprint.’ She added: ‘Shoppers will get the same amount of toilet paper but with a smaller tube and therefore less packaging – including the outside film.’
