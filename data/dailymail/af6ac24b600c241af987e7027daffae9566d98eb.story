A Serbian fisherman has designed and built a coal-powered backpack which can cook his catch while keeping him warm in sub-zero temperatures. 

Aleks Mijatovic, 45, said he created his unique piece of equipment so he could  remain at the riverbank in the depths of winter without freezing to death.

The angler from Leskovac, southern Serbia, used a few pieces of scrap metal lying around his home to create his masterpiece.

Aleks Mijatovic designed his coal-fired backpack to cook his catch and keep him warm while out fishing 

Mr Mijatovic, from Leskovac, pictured, said he had his epiphany one night while he was in bed 

The intrepid fisherman said he found an old drum and welded it to a piece of pipe after his dream

He said: 'I tend to go early in the mornings or even at night when the temperatures are well into igloo conditions and warm clothes weren't really doing the job.

'I had stacks of jumpers on and a load of pants but after a couple of hours I was still freezing.

'Then, one night in bed, I had an epiphany.

'I dreamt I had a portable oven on my back which not only kept me warm but also cooked my catch on the spot.

'When I woke up I knew exactly what I had to do.'

After his dream, he spent the weekend working on his backpack oven. He said he found an old metal drum and welded a pipe to the side to act as a chimney. He then filled the container with white-hot coals.  

Mr Mijatovic said he used to go fishing in several layers of clothes but this was not enough to keep him warm

Mr Mijatovic then spent the weekend working on his backpack oven.

Taking an old metal drum, he welded a pipe to the side to act as a chimney and then filled the drum with white hot coals.

Now, he and the bizarre contraption have become the talk of the town.

Pal Ilija Kovacevic, 40, said: "Aleks has always been a bit of a dreamer but this time it seems to have paid off.

"It looks ridiculous and potentially dangerous, but he says it's safe and does keep him warm. He says the heat from his back spreads over his whole body and he feels warm all the time now when fishing."
