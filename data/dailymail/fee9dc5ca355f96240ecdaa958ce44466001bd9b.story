'The other day a lady in the Body Shop leaned over me and put her hands on my shoulders while she talked to someone else over my head,' says Gillian Martin, 37, a primary school teacher from Lancashire.

'People stare, take pictures with smartphones, are rude, 
physically touch us or pat you on the head ... It happens a lot 
and it's people of all ages.'

This is what life looks like when you live with achondroplasia, one of the most common forms of dwarfism. It affects between one in 15,000 and one in 40,000 babies born every year.

Happy family: Gillian Martin (centre) with her husband Stephen and 13-year-old daughter, Sophie features on ITV documentary My Dwarf Family

Gillian and her daughter Sophie, 13, were both born with the disorder and along with her husband Stephen the three of them are the focus of a new ITV documentary: My Dwarf Family.

The hour-long programme follows the trio as they go about their daily life, and Gillian insists that the one-off documentary shows life as it really is for those with achondroplasia.

Like others with the condition, she's had to get used dealing with practical difficulties and harassment on a regular basis and in the show addresses concerns about the future of her daughter as she enters her teenage years.

'I don't think body image will take over at 
all,' explains Gillian. 'Generally speaking. she's always attracted stares, so at 14 she's 
used to that.

'She's obviously delighted she's turning into a young 
woman but she's already had to come to terms with her body.'

For Gillian herself, tackling her teenage years was made easy by her supportive parents. 'I was just in a very positive 
environment and never let my height stop me.

'I've fulfilled everything I
wanted to do. The only big issue was getting a boyfriend at peer age. That was
the biggest, no, only drawback.'

Like others with achondroplasia, a genetic disorder that affects bone growth, Gillian has a normal sized trunk but drastically shortened legs.

As a result, getting around requires much forward-planning, but this notwithstanding, emphasises Gillian, she and her family are totally normal.

Gillian believes that some famous dwarves use their disorder as currency, but rates actor Peter Dinklage: 'He's a man who happens to be a dwarf. If Sophie ever wanted to go into acting, he'd be the one I'd tell her to look at.'

Normal: Gillian hopes the documentary will show viewers that small people are just like everyone else

Couple: Ben and Rebecca Taylor also feature in My Dwarf Family and hope to have children one day

'I wanted people to see a different representation of a small family on television,' she explains. 'The programme offers different perspectives [on living with achondroplasia].

'Other programmes showing small families have been quite negative but I wanted to show that we're just normal people with normal difficulties.

'We raise our daughter telling her she can be whatever she wants to be just like everyone else.'

One such negative representation comes, thinks Gillian, from performers such as Warwick Davis who are all too ready to make comic currency from their condition.

'A few years ago, he [Warwick Davis] appeared at a comedy awards show with Dara Ã“ Briain, sitting on his shoulder.

'I just thought no ... little boys sit on people's shoulders and he's a grown man. He's showing people that he's happy to be treated as a child and I just think that's not the right message.

'I've got nothing against the guy - he has a career and is trying to do a lot for 
awareness - but you have to think about whole TV audience. We need to get rid of the idea that dwarves are there to be laughed at.'

One actor who does meet with her approval is Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage, who plays the scheming Tyrion Lannister.

'He's a dwarf character but that's not the point of the role,' she explains. 
'He's a man who happens to be a dwarf. If Sophie ever wanted to go into acting, he [Dinklage] would be the one I'd tell her to look at.'

Whatever career Sophie eventually chooses, her 'no-nonsense' mother will be right behind her. At the moment though, she's got more immediate matters on her mind.

'I hope people will realise that it's about getting to 
know the person rather than the difference,' she says of tonight's documentary.

'One of the beautiful things about my relationship with Stephen is that height has never been an issue. He fell in love with me for me.

'Apart from practical difficulties, we're just normal people who do normal things.'

My Dwarf Family is on ITV1 tonight at 9pm. See itv.com for more information
