Children as young as TEN are being enrolled on a council run weight-loss programme in a bid to get them to shed the pounds, it emerged this week.

School children between the ages of 10 and 17 are being signed up to a 12-week 'self help' course to teach them about healthy eating and the importance of exercise.

Those involved will take part in cookery classes and physical activities, as well as discussing the underlying reasons for their weight problems.

Organisers of the 'Self Help Independence Nutrition and Exercise' (SHINE) course, running in Weston-super-Mare, north Somerset, hope to improve children's self-esteem.

Figures show more than one in three 10 to 11-year-olds in the UK is now deemed 'above healthy weight'.

Organisers are encouraging parents to admit their child is overweight and sign them up for the course.

A spokesperson for the scheme said: 'We'll also be encouraging physical activity and looking at the reasons that they may be a little bit above their expected weight.

'Body image and self esteem will also be something that is looked at over the course of the scheme.

'We are very keen to get the children involved in cookery courses and hopefully that will be something we can do.

'We are hoping to have 10-12 children on the course but obviously it is difficult to keep the numbers up.

'Many of the children may drop out before the course has finished as it can become quite difficult for them.

'Obviously it's also quite a difficult thing to get the parents to agree to send their children.'

A leading health charity has warned that, whilst it is important for children to be educated in healthy eating and exercise, raising the issue could actually have a negative impact on their health.

A spokesperson for eating disorder helpline B-eat, said: 'Obviously it's important how the message is conveyed to young people and their parents.

'A healthy balanced diet and regular exercise is key to individuals being fit and active.

'If there are underlying problems driving the weight gain then it's good to know that these would be addressed but hopefully in a way that will not cause a contrary reaction in a young child and lead them to lose an unhealthy amount of weight.'

The scheme has previously been run in other areas, including Sheffield and Plymouth.
