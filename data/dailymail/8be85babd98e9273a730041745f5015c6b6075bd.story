It is believed 3,168 units of Sterimar Isotonic have been affected

Thousands of packets of a high street nasal spray are being withdrawn amid safety fears that they could be contaminated with harmful bacteria.

It is believed 3,168 units of Sterimar Isotonic, a seawater 
solution which helps breathing, have been affected.

The breathing aid can be bought online and at high street retailers such as Boots priced at £6.75 for an 100ml bottle.

The governmental Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have reported that possible symptoms caused by infected canisters can include fever, discoloured mucas or tenderness in the face or nose.

The manufacturer, Church & Dwight UK Ltd, which manages a range of healthcare products including Pearl Drops and hair removal brand Nair have said that the product was mistakenly released and it is just two batches that are affected.

Since the recall issued last Friday much of the stock has been accounted for apart from 2,452 individual cans.

A spokeswoman for Church & Dwight
UK Ltd said: 'As a company we constantly test our products.

'Sometimes 
we will find we will have a certain number of certain chemicals in a 
product.

'It does not mean there are risks but it means it is a level we are not comfortable to be in the market so we quarantine that.

'Unfortunately on this occasion it was mistakenly released
onto the supply chain.'

The MHRA has stated that those who suffer from sinus or nasal 
problems, have recently undergone surgery or have a weak immune system 
may be at risk.

However the two bacteria identified, Pseudomonas stutzeri and Sphingomonas paucimobilis  - 
commonly found in soil, water and hospital environments - should not 
affect healthy people and human infections are rare.

Makers claim that the Stérimar product is completely natural and helps relieve symptoms associated with allergies, hayfever, cold, rhinitis, sinusitis.

It is described on the website as being suitable for all
ages including babies and children.

Consumers who have any of the 
affected batches - FE1248b and FE1249, numbers which can be located on 
the packaging and the base of the an - to stop using the product 
immediately and return it to the retailer.

A spokeswoman for Church & Dwight
UK Ltd added: 'If anyone has any unusual symptoms they should 
speak to their GP.

'But we do think the risk here is very low.'
