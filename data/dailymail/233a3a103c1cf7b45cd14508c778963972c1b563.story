An incredible video has emerged  of an ox being rescued from a manhole in China's Jiangxi Province.

A local farmer identified as Mr Deng found the ox stuck down the manhole a day after it went missing from his farm.

As soon as he recognised it, he crawled into the opening in the ground to attempt to corral the animal with a rope.

The ox's owner, a farmer called Mr Deng, recognised the animal, who had run away from his farm a day earlier

Unfortunately, when a fire crew arrived to perform the rescue, they were unable to lift the 450lb animal out of the hole on their own.

Thankfully, eight workers from a nearby construction site volunteered their assistance.

Within seconds, the ox regained his strength and quickly dashed away from the group of men

Once Mr Deng managed to hook the rope around the ox’s body, the construction workers began to hoist the large animal out of the hole.

Though the ox initially put up a fight, he soon gave up his struggle and allowed the determined men to lift him to safety.

Moments after the ox was freed, he jumped to his feet and ran away from his rescuers.
