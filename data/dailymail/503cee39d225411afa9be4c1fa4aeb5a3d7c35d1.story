Barack Obama's great-uncle, a Second World War veteran, has died aged 89 from non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Charles T. Payne, who helped liberate a Nazi concentration camp in World War II, died on August 1 in Chicago.

Mr Payne was briefly in the pubic eye during the President's first election campaign when Obama mistakenly said his great-uncle had liberated Auschwitz.

 Mr Payne played a role in liberating Ohrdruf, a section of the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany

When he was just 20, Mr Payne, had in fact helped free prisoners at Ohrdruf, a section of the Buchenwald concentration camp where an estimated 56,545 people were killed by the SS.

It was Soviet forces who liberated Auschwitz in January 1945 as they marched across Nazi-occupied Poland.

Mr Payne, who is the brother of Obama's maternal grandmother Madelyn Dunham, said at the time that he was 'truly astonished' by the attention paid to the gaffe, and called his nephew 'truly an astounding young man'.

The veteran modestly played down his role in the liberation of Ohrdruf, but described the horrors he saw there, including a circle of dead inmates in rags that had clearly been near starvation when they were killed.

He said: 'They were there with their tin cups like they were called to get food, then had been machine gunned.

'Nothing but just skin over bones with nothing, no flesh at all.'

During his first election campaign, Obama mistakenly said that Mr Payne had helped free prisoners at Auschwitz, but quickly corrected himself

After the war, Mr Payne went to college in Kansas, where he had grown up.

He went on to graduate at the University of Chicago, where Obama would later lecture on constitutional law.

Uncle Charlie, as he was called by the President, became a pioneer in IT at the university, retiring aged 70 from his position as assistant director of the college's library.

Melanie, his wife of 50 years, said her husband was 'very pleased and proud' to have served in two Presidential delegations in recent years to commemorate World War II anniversaries.

He is also survived by a son, Richard.
