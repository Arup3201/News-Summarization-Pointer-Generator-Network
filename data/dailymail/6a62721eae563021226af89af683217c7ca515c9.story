The baby mama of New York Yankees star second baseman Robinson Cano, 31, has spoken out to demand more child-support and her lawyer claims the star currently spends more on his dogs than on his three-year-old son.

Jackelin Castro, 39, is the mother of Cano’s three-year-old son, Robinson Miguel Cano Castro. They live in Cano’s home country of the Dominican Republic.

She has accused the Yankees star of paying too little and too erratically towards his son’s upkeep.

Cano and Castro, who were a couple between 2008 and 2011, are currently embroiled in a child-support dispute.

She claims Cano had a lawyer come to her home in February to try and get her to agree to accept $600 a month over the next 10 years, which she refused.

‘The intention of him and his advisers was somewhat to intimidate me,’ Castro told ESPN.com. 

Cano, who made $15 million last season, has disputed the mother’s claims in a statement.

Jackelin Castro, 39, claims Cano sent a lawyer to her home to try to get her to agree to accepting $600 a month child support for his son

‘I have gone above and beyond to care
for my child including an agreed upon monthly stipend, a house, a car, 
insurance, school and other essentials for the baby and his mother as 
well many other things including toys and clothing,’ he said.

‘This
is a private matter and I will not fight it in the media, nor will I 
say anything disparaging about the mother of my child or comment any 
further. I look forward to an amicable resolution that will allow me 
time with my son.’

Castro has complained the Cano’s $600 a month payments are delivered sporadically by a relative and without notice. Her lawyer Wendy Diaz is demanding $25,000 a month.

‘I believe the money he gives to the son, when he does, is not enough to feed the dogs of Robinson Cano’s house,’ Diaz said.

‘Maybe he is expending more money on the dogs and cars that he has than on his own child.’

The pair are scheduled back in court on Nov. 7.

Cano's ex-girlfriend has also attacked the public image that he conveys through his RC24 Foundation, which helps underserved children

Castro also attacked Cano’s public image that he conveys through his RC24 Foundation, which helps underserved children.

‘What hurts me most [is] he shows the world that he helps children, that he's a good person, he's very humane,’ she said.

‘So with something of his own, he may trick the world and everybody who sees him because he's the big star that he is, but there's a reality, which is a son who doesn't [receive] the quality of life he's supposed to.’

At the same time as Cano is fighting the child-support dispute, his advisers are preparing to seek a big money free-agent contract which could increase his salary yet further.

If all goes as planned, the five-time All-Star will sign a multi-year deal with the New York Yankees or another team this winter.
