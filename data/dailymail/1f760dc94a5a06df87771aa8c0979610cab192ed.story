A 53-year-old mother who had three children with one of Joanna Dennehy’s accomplices revealed today how she feared her family could have been the serial killer's next victims.

Julie Gibbons - whose ex-partner was 48-year-old Gary Stretch - said that after Dennehy, 31, killed three people in Peterborough, ‘me and my family could have been in for it as well’.

Dennehy fatally stabbed Lukasz Slaboszewski, Kevin Lee, and John Chapman last year - before Stretch drove her to Hereford where she randomly stabbed two dog walkers, who both survived.

Weapon: A knife used by Dennehy, of Peterborough, to murder three people and stab another two people

Miss Gibbons told the Daily Mirror: ‘We could have been her next victims - who knows what she would have done? She had already killed three people.

‘In a prison phone call he [Stretch] told me that Dennehy knew about me and the kids. I said: “Did she threaten us then?” He said: “Don't worry about it, I wouldn't have let anything happen to you.”’

Miss Gibbons - who described Stretch as a 'gentle giant' - added: ‘She must have had him under her spell... I don't think he could see that she was bad.'

She met 7ft 3in Stretch at a Peterborough nightclub in 1991. Last week he was convicted at Cambridge Crown Court of two attempted murders and three counts of preventing a lawful burial.

She said she hoped Stretch will be shown leniency by a judge when sentenced. He and Miss Gibbons had three children during a 13-year relationship - Charlie, 17, Garry, 16, and Melanie, 14.

A month-long trial heard that Stretch and fellow accomplice Leslie Layton, 37, were in the ‘thrall’ of Dennehy, who had already admitted the three murders and two attempted murders.

She ‘exploded’ into violence last 
March, first killing friend Mr Slaboszewski, 31, after luring him to a 
house by text.  She killed her housemate Mr Chapman, 56, and Mr Lee, 48, her married landlord 
and lover, ten days later.

All
 three victims were stabbed through the heart and their bodies dumped in
 ditches. Stretch then drove Dennehy 140 miles to Hereford where she 
stabbed Robin Bereza, 64, and John Rogers, 56.

Both suffered critical injuries but survived. Stretch and Dennehy were arrested that day. In the police custody suite she joked to officers about her ‘hectic week’.

While Stretch had driven Dennehy around and helped her pick victims, Layton joined him in helping to dispose of the bodies. Both claimed they had been acting under duress.

As well as Stretch’s convictions last week, Layton was convicted of perverting the course of justice and two counts of preventing a lawful burial.

A third accomplice, Robert Moore who also lived in Peterborough, sheltered Dennehy and Stretch for a night and had admitted assisting Dennehy. All four will be sentenced later.
