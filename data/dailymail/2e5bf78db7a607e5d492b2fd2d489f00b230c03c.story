More than 20 private schools are involved in child sex abuse investigations after dozens of victims came forward in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Some of the country’s leading institutions, including those attended by Nick Clegg, Boris Johnson and Tony Blair, face accusations of covering up abuse for decades. The allegations include rape.

Lawyers acting for the alleged victims are demanding up to £400,000 in compensation for the years of abuse they suffered.

 Rush (right) was jailed for abusing boys 40 years ago

Those seeking redress include former 
pupils at Beeston Hall, a £21,000-a-year prep school in Norfolk. Mervyn 
Rush, 68, who taught science at the school in the 1970s, was jailed for 
14 years in August last year after pleading guilty to 18 charges of 
sexual abuse against ten boys aged between eight and 12.

Victims were emboldened to come forward following the Savile scandal, according to one lawyer.

Jessica
 Standley, of law firm Slater and Gordon, said: ‘There has been an 
increase in victims reporting abuse suffered at a variety of 
institutions, including fee-paying schools. Sadly, in many of these 
cases those in positions of authority knew of the abuse and failed to 
take adequate steps to protect innocent children.’

With
 compensation claims of up to £400,000 per victim, the financial 
repercussions of these historical cases could cause the closure of some 
prep schools, claims Tony Little, head of Eton College. It is possible 
[some will have to close] but it is absolutely right this problem is 
exposed,’ he said.

Denstone College in Staffordshire is among the schools facing claims for compensation

Some 20 
former pupils of Ashdown House in East Sussex, which was attended by 
Mayor of London Boris Johnson and Homeland actor Damian Lewis, claim 
that staff committed ‘very serious abuse’ on children aged between seven
 and 13 during the 1970s. The £23,000-a-year boarding school is a feeder
 school for Eton and Harrow.

Victims at Mr Clegg’s old prep school, £22,000-a-year Caldicott, in Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire, are also suing for damages.

Peter
 Wright, who was Mr Clegg’s headmaster, is awaiting sentence after being
 found guilty last month of a series of sex offences. The Chorister 
School in Durham, the £18,000-a-year prep school attended by Mr Blair, 
recently settled a series of sex abuse claims.

Police
 investigated allegations by 23 former pupils that they had been 
sexually abused by Canon John Grove, who was headmaster from 1957 to 
1978.

Schools attended by Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Boris Johnson are among those facing allegations of abuse

But the investigation
 ended without any criminal charges as Canon Grove died in 2001 and 
police found no evidence against anyone still alive.

Many
 victims say they simply want justice after years of staying silent. 
One, a 60-year-old man who attended Chorister, said: ‘All I really 
wanted was an apology from the school and the church.

‘The Savile disgrace has  made it easier for victims to come forward.’

Beeston Hall has confirmed that its lawyers are handling claims  for damages.

No one at Ashdown House, Chorister or Caldicott was available for comment yesterday.
