Freelance sports TV producer David Katz has revealed he was drunk when he fooled a National Enquirer reporter into believing he was the late actor's gay lover.

Katz's phone in New Jersey rang off the hook after the actor's death early in February as reporter's clamored to speak to the man they thought was Hoffman's playwright best friend.

But it was a totally different David Katz who tragically discovered his friend dead in a Manhattan apartment February 2 and now that man has successfully won a fat settlement after the Enquirer printed a story touting Hoffman's 'hidden gay life!'

Hoffman died early Super Bowl Sunday and David Katz was home for the big game.

'As the day went on, I had a bunch of beers in me,' he told Page Six on Wednesday.

When asked about his false claims, the fake Katz said he remembered the onslaught of calls but not the comment that eventually ignited a potentially multimillion libel suit.

'I don’t remember what I said . . . but the thing about the gay lover? No, not while I was sober anyway. I don’t remember. I don’t think so.'

'Hidden Gay Life!': The Enquirer printed a cover story with the headline 'Hidden gay life! Exclusive interview with tragic Oscar winner's lover'

Days after the Enquirer spoke to Katz, they printed a story that appeared with a cover headline 'Hidden gay life! Exclusive interview with tragic Oscar winner's lover.'

The real man they were looking for was Hoffman's platonic friend David Bar Katz, who promptly filed suit against the tabloid.

And before even the close of the month, he'd won his settlement.

In a one-page ad printed on Wednesday in the New York Times, the Enquirer said it 'responsibly acknowledged its error' for a story that purported to be an exclusive interview with David Bar Katz. The Enquirer also apologized to Katz, a playwright who discovered Hoffman’s body.

Hoffman died of an apparent heroin overdose on 2 February.

The Times reported on the settlement and said the ad was part of the agreement.

The American Playwriting Foundation will award $45,000 yearly for an unproduced play that embodies Hoffman’s “passion for truth”. Katz’s lawyer told the New York Times the amount wouldn’t be disclosed.

The real Katz sued and and was quickly offered a settlement by the Enquirer. He plans to use the undisclosed sum to start a fund to award a talented burgeoning playwright $45,000 each year in Hoffman's honor
