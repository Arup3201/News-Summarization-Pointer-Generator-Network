L’Ami Serge will head directly to the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival in March after a 14-length win in the 32Red Tolworth Hurdle at Sandown.

Ladbrokes reacted to one of the best novice hurdler performances seen in Britain this season by slashing his price to 7-1 from 12-1.That makes L’Ami Serge second favourite behind Douvan (4-1), trained by Willie Mullins.

It was a fourth win in the last five runnings of the Tolworth for trainer Nicky Henderson but, surprisingly, his first Grade One of a so far frustrating season. The Lambourn trainer will be hoping the floodgates now open, especially with stable star Sprinter Sacre due to return after more than a year off at Ascot a week on Saturday.

Henderson said: ‘We will give L’Ami Serge January off, get him ready in February and hopefully be there in March. Even for me I must admit I did think that was impressive. He looks the part.’

The surprising thing is that L’Ami Serge ran six times in France without winning. Since crossing the Channel, he has bloomed with previous victories in the Gerry Feilden Hurdle at Newbury and the Kennel Gate Novices’ Hurdle at Ascot.

Tolworth runner-up Jolly’s Cracked It could now head down the handicap route after being put in his place. Trainer Harry Fry will enter him in Newbury’s Betfair Hurdle.

The 32Red Casino Handicap Chase was won by Paul Nicholls-trained Unioniste, ridden by Noel Fehily.
