Yankees boss Brian Cashman emerged in public today for the first time since his wife filed for divorce after humiliating claims he had an affair with his accused 'crazed stalker'.

Scruffily dressed, he visited the family’s $3.7 million Darien mansion where his wife Mary has been living apart in the wake of the allegations - but the 44-year-old spent less than a minute inside, reports the new York Post.

Mrs Cashman, 42, had said the marriage had 'broken down irretrievably' in the divorce papers submitted yesterday.

It comes after alleged mistress Louise Neathway, who Mr Cashman previously attempted to have committed to a mental asylum, accused him of having an affair with her as she appeared in court on Thursday.

She was charged with stalking Mr Cashman
and attempting to blackmail the Yankees boss for $6,000 with threats 
she would reveal the alleged affair.

The general manager's wife is seeking permanent alimony, half of their property and joint custody of their two children, reports the New York Post.

British native Neathway, also known as Louise Meanwell, was arrested on Wednesday and is facing charges of grand larceny, stalking and harassment.

Mrs Cashman, who endured the humiliation of an affair her husband had back in 2009, has been living apart from him in the family’s $3.7 million mansion with her daughter and son, sources told the Post. 

On Thursday prosecutors said Neathway harassed Cashman with hundreds of text messages, and demanded he give her $15,000 to pay for an unspecified medical procedure.

She allegedly threatened to contact the press and his family with claims that would hurt his personal relationships and professional standing, according to a court complaint.

Cashman made two payments, one for $4,000 and another for $2,000.

Cashman even tried to get rid of his alleged mistress by urging her mother to have her committed, sources told the New York Daily News.

He contacted Caroline Meanwell last week and told her that her daughter was mentally unstable and 'needs help', the sources said.

The call led to a meeting between Meanwell, Cashman and his lawyer.

Meanwell was presented with a report that stated her daughter was 'mentally unstable'.

'He told the mother she needed help,' one of the sources told the Daily News.

'He suggested to her that she try to have her committed'

In a meeting on January 27, Cashman and Meanwell placed a conference call to Louise’s Manhattan psychiatrist, Charlotte Murphy, who agreed with Cashman, sources told the Post said. 

'Everyone was convinced that [Louise] was a danger to herself or others,' one source told the Post.

'Murphy agreed that Louise was dangerous and violent, and that it was a serious situation. She said to call 911,'.

Meanwell made the call which eventually led to her daughter's arrest.

Mr Cashman claims he was stalked and blackmailed into handing over $6,000 to Louise Neathway

Neathway's lawyers said Mr Cashman was 'a 
married man having an inappropriate relationship' with Neathway, a 
medical sales worker and single mother of a 14-year-old daughter, and he
turned on her when it 'ended badly'

Neathway’s lawyers claim their client is the real victim of a romance that 
began in April and 'ended badly.'

She
is also reported by the Post to have claimed to several friends that 
she had a year long affair with Cashman which she ended after he did not
fulfill a promise to leave his wife.

Neathway has a criminal history of harassment and trespassing going back to 1988 and spanning three states.

She has allegedly been harassing her ex-husband Jason Bump, their daughter and a long line of boyfriends she’s had since her marriage broke up, reports the Post.

'She’s a very dangerous person. She’s a psychopath, in my estimation,' Mr Bump, told The Post.

'There’s currently an order of protection for myself, my daughter, my wife and my mother' against her.

'She has not seen our daughter in a few years, and she’s not allowed to contact her at all,' he said reports the Post.

Cashman is the latest in a line of men who claim Neathway has tormented them with death threats, phone hacking and lies about miscarriages, court records and former friends claim, according to the Post.

In 2010 a former lover, who works on Wall Street, told the police that 'she has made many threatening statements aimed at me and has been e-mailing and phoning me constantly.

'She’s also begun waiting outside my apartment in the East Village,' court records said according to the Post.

'I am fearful for my safety and have no idea what this woman is capable of. As of this morning, she has hacked into my personal e-mail account and my Facebook account, deleting all my e-mails. I am VERY scared of her.' he ex-fling said.

Mrs Cashman served her husband with divorce papers on January 31, the day before Neathway was arrested, reports the Post. The documents were filed in court yesterday.

She previously stood by her husband as he was romantically linked to a Westchester mother-of-two, Kim Brennan.

A spokesman for Brian Cashman declined a request from the Post to comment on the divorce filing.
