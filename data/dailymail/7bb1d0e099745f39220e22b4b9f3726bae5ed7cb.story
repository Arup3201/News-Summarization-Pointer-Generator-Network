Mario Balotelli may have drawn criticism while enduring a relatively barren start to his Liverpool career - but supportive team-mates Jose Enrique and Suso are still singing his praises.

The Italian firebrand silenced some doubters by scoring his first goal at Anfield in Liverpool's dramatic 2-1 comeback against Swansea in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday - closely followed by a bust-up with Jonjo Shelvey at the end of the game.

And, while they are unlikely to make it on the X Factor, Spanish team-mates Enrique and Suso showed their appreciation with a rendition of the striker's 'Mario fantastico, Mario magnifico' chant that has been adopted by the Kop.

The pair recorded the song, which offers the lyrics 'Mario fantastico, Mario magnifico, ole ole ole', from what appears to be the training ground swimming pool before sending it to Balotelli via social media.

The 24-year-old was pleased enough to post the video on his Instagram with the message: 'Jose and Suso. That cute voice lol! I want to see how they sing in English also!'

Never far from controversy, the Italian was also embroiled in a spat with former Liverpool player Jonjo Shelvey

The injured Spaniards were in the stands to watch their side's midweek win, although manager Brendan Rodgers has confirmed that Enrique is still struggling with a knee injury. 

'Jose is still not available, it's just an issue with his knee. He won't be available for the squad.' Rodgers told his pre-match media conference.
