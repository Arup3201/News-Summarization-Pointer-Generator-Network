A father-of-three is 'stranded' in a Philippines hospital - because he is unable to pay his medical bills.

George 'Dougie' Keiller, 59, collapsed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on the last leg of his journey to the capital Manila on February 11.

He woke up six days later. Yet six weeks on, he lies anchored to a hospital bed and is unable to leave because he can not afford a medical bill which has so far reached £4,000.

Dougie Keiller says he is stranded in the Philippines because he is unable to pay a £4,000 medical bill. He has been hospitalised for six weeks because of a chronic lung condition. He is pictured with fiancee Evangeline Go

Doctors at the Polymedic General Hospital, in Cagayan De Oro City, on the central coast of northern Mindanao island, have said they will not discharge him until they are paid at least half of his burgeoning invoice, he alleges.

Mr Keiller said: 'After more than six weeks I'm now just desperate for this nightmare to end.'

Mr Keiller, from Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland, was put on a life-support machine within hours of touching down in the Philippines after his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - which causes a narrowing of the airways - struck him down.

He recalled: 'I woke up in the hospital and didn't know what had happened to me.

'I didn't - and still can't - remember anything after leaving China.

'I only know I had slight difficulties with my breathing when I landed, but by the time I boarded my flight to Manila I felt absolutely fine.'

Dougie Keiller has suffered from pulmonary disease COPD for 10 years. The condition causes a narrowing of the airways. When Mr Keiller arrived in the Philippines he was taken seriously ill and has been in hospital for six weeks

However, it was upon arriving in the Filipino capital to meet his fiancee Evangeline Go, 54, that he collapsed. He was rushed to the private Polymedic Hospital and put on life support.

'It was six days before I was aware of what was happening,' Mr Keiller said. He added: 'I was then treated for fever and pneumonia.

'I've had COPD for 10 years but have flown four or five times in the last five years problem-free.

'The condition landed me in hospital twice last year, so I asked doctors if I should cancel this trip but they told me there was no need for me to do that as it wasn't likely to cause any problems.'

With the medical green light, the former bus driver said he attended his local Royal Bank of Scotland branch to arrange travel insurance and claims he was offered free cover as a Royalties Gold account holder.

The Scottish father took out insurance through RBS. He alleges the bank will not pay his bills because his condition was 'pre-existing'. Mr Keiller alleges the bank did not ask him about any health conditions

Mr Keiller, who is on disability allowance, alleged: 'All they provided me with was a leaflet with a phone number to call. I called that number and was given a number to call if I had any problems while I was away.

'That was all I got. No terms and conditions and no questions, but was told I was covered to travel.'

After six days on life support, Mr Keiller claims that he phoned the number provided but, three weeks later, he alleges that RBS declined to pay out, saying that he had failed to inform them of his pre-existing lung condition.

Since then, he has remained stranded in hospital with no means to pay the £2,000 discharge fee - a bill that swells by a further £150 each day.

Mr Keiller has raised £1,300 but he still remains almost £1,000 short.

'I'm now relying on donations and praying that they come soon,' said Mr Keiller. 'Until I get enough money I remain virtually a prisoner in this hospital.

'If I can be given a loan by someone I'd be so grateful and wouldn't let anyone down as far as repayment goes.

'I've been terrified here. There have been times where I've feared I'll never see outside of this hospital again. I'm now just desperate for this nightmare to end.'

An RBS spokesperson confirmed that the bank is aware of Mr Keiller's situation and said that the case is being looked into.

A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said: 'We are aware of the hospitalisation of a British National in the Philippines. We are providing consular assistance.'
