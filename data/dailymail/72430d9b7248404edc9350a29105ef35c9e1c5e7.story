A magistrate issued a heartfelt plea to a cannabis grower urging him to stay away from the drug – after revealing it killed her brother.

Yvonne Davies gave Christopher Duncan, 55, the stark warning as she sentenced him to 200 hours’ unpaid work for growing the class B drug.

The 65-year-old chairman of the bench told of the ‘living hell’ her family went through when her brother Glen Harding died from an addiction to cannabis.

Duncan had appeared before Manchester magistrates after pleading guilty to the production of cannabis.

Heartfelt: Magistrate Yvonne Davies said she felt no regrets in speaking out about the dangers of cannabis while sentencing an offender

Police found six mature plants and 18 seedlings in the conservatory of his home in Ancoats, Manchester.

Mr Harding killed himself aged 39 after becoming a cannabis addict and developing schizophrenia and depression.

Mrs Davies told Duncan: ‘It was a 
horrendous time for the family. Cannabis is serious. It puddles the 
brain apart from anything else. You have got to stop using it so jack it
 in.’

Mr Harding, who died in 1997, was a successful technical draughtsman before falling prey to addiction.

Mrs Davies said: ‘He was a very caring and clever person but he had this addiction.

Tragic: Glen Harding became addicted to cannabis and threw himself into a canal in 1984 aged 34

‘At first he would just smoke it at weekends and the family knew about it but we weren’t happy at all.

‘We tried to discuss it with him on a few occasions but he would just brush off our concerns saying that it wasn’t dangerous.

‘But we noticed a change when he 
started smoking it more than just at weekends.’ Mr Harding began using 
the drug on a daily basis and, two years before his death, suffered an 
epileptic seizure at his workplace in Warrington.

He was immediately sent home and eventually lost his job after bosses became aware of his addiction. 

Mrs Davies said Mr Harding could not cope with unemployment and so smoked more cannabis, eventually developing depression.

She said: ‘We noticed a  definite 
change in his  personality as he would get angry and very anxious. He 
was trying to hide it from us but we all knew what was going on and were
 hoping that he would stop.’

Mr Harding went on to develop 
schizophrenia and, following a row with his parents one night, stormed 
out with the family dog – which returned on its own, soaking wet, 
several hours later.

His body was found in the canal at 
Lock Lane, Partington, by a walker ten days later. Mrs Davies, who lives
 in Partington, Manchester, said: ‘People say cannabis is not a big deal
 but to me it is enormous.

‘It can absolutely ruin your life and I would urge youngsters to think long and hard before taking it.’
  ‘When Glen’s body was found, it had been a living hell for the family.’

The part-time magistrate, who is also
 a mental health counsellor and psychotherapist, said she had no regrets
 about speaking out – and said it is not the first time she has used her
 story as a warning.

‘When I tell people about what happened, some look at me like I’ve got two heads but one woman defendant burst into tears.

‘If I can stop one family going through what I went through it will be worth it.’

Marjorie Wallace, of mental health
charity SANE, said: ‘While some people can take cannabis without lasting
 damage, there is a significant minority for whom the drug can trigger 
psychotic episodes of paranoia and delusions.

‘While we don’t know who  is vulnerable, the risks to  the mind of taking  cannabis should never be underestimated.’
