Adam Lallana, who is in line to make his Liverpool debut against Aston Villa this weekend, appeared to have a deep discussion with Brendan Rodgers during Friday's pre-match training session at Melwood.

Summer signing Lallana has missed Liverpool's first three Premier League games with a knee injury which ruled him out for six weeks.

However Lallana has given Rodgers a timely boost ahead of their fixture against Paul Lambert's side by returning to full fitness.

Mario Balotelli is also in contention to start Saturday's late evening fixture despite being forced to train away from the squad in fear that he would spread his illness to his team-mates.

Rodgers, speaking to the Liverpool Echo, confirmed news of the Italian's return to full health: 'Mario has had a bit of a bug that we wanted to make sure he didn't spread around the group. But he'll be okay for Saturday.'

The Liverpool boss will be delighted with news of Lallana and Balotelli's return to fitness as the Reds have found it hard to claim a league win at home to Aston Villa during the last three seasons.

Liverpool last defeated Aston Villa in a league match at Anfield during the 2010-11 season when former players David Ngog, Ryan Babel and Maxi Rodriguez all managed to get on the scoresheet.

Rodgers will be without star striker Daniel Sturridge for the next three weeks as the former Chelsea and Manchester City forward suffered a thigh injury during an England training session.
