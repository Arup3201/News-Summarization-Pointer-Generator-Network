'Amazing guy': Stuart Chance died while snorkelling on a holiday in the Maldives

A charity worker has died while snorkelling in the Maldives on a holiday to celebrate his father’s 60th birthday.

Stuart Chance, 34, was staying with his parents Jacqueline, 58, and Donald, 60, at the Summer Island Village resort and had gone to a local diving spot.

Police were called after he was dragged out of the water but officers said they were treating the death as an accident.

Mr Chance, of Moulton Chapel, Lincolnshire, worked at a Cancer Research UK shop in Spalding four days a week and had been volunteering since 2002.

Store manager Sasha Darley said: ‘He was a great friend and a really nice guy. He loved going on holiday to the Maldives.

'He went every year with his family.

'He was an amazing man. He worked on the shop floor and was really well liked.

'Everyone knew Stuart and he'll be badly missed.'

A neighbour said: ‘Stuart loved his family and football.

'They had come up from London and were still big Millwall fans.’

Local police corporal Naufal Easa said officers believed Mr Chance had drowned accidentally on Tuesday. ‘We are investigating,’ he added.

His sister Nicki posted details of the tragedy on Facebook, writing: 'It is with sadness that early this morning my "little" brother Stuart Chance was cruelly taken from us whilst out snorkelling in the Maldives. R.I.P. bruv, we all love and miss you.'
