The New Mexico Livestock Board has launched an investigation into a southern New Mexico dairy after an activist working with an animal welfare group recorded secret video showing workers whipping cows with chains and wire cables, kicking and punching the animals, and shocking them with electric prods.

Board officials confirmed the investigation into the practices at the Winchester Dairy near Dexter on Tuesday. They were working on interviewing the activist and tracking down the workers identified in the video.

'We are investigating it very aggressively. The district attorney is on board and everybody is working hard to make sure we do this right,' said Shawn Davis, an area supervisor with the livestock board.

Disturbing: Animal rights group Mercy for Animal recently released a video showing abuse at a New Mexico dairy farm

Dairy officials have been cooperating since investigators first arrived last Friday, board officials said.

The dairy said in a statement that animal care and well-being are central to its operation. As a result, the dairy fired all employees and referred the abusive workers to law enforcement for further review following its own internal investigation.

The dairy also halted milking operations, stopped shipments to all vendors and dispersed thousands of cows to other dairies with strong track records in animal welfare.

In pain: In the video, dairy employees are seen punching, kicking, prodding and whipping the helpless animals at Winchester Dairy in southern New Mexico 

Kicked: Winchester Dairy produces milk for Denver-based Leprino Foods, a cheese company which supplies Papa John's pizza, Stouffer's and Hot Pockets 

'We remain committed to the ethical and responsible treatment of the animals and have learned from this incident,' the dairy said.

It was not immediately clear whether the dairy's closure was temporary. Winchester is one of more than 140 family-owned dairies in New Mexico, a state that ranks in the top 10 nationally when it comes to milk production. The industry employs about 4,200 workers and has a direct economic impact of about $1 billion.

The Los Angeles-based animal welfare group Mercy for Animals first sent the video footage to the livestock agency last Thursday. It released a compilation of clips that show the abuse during a news conference Wednesday in Albuquerque.

An activist with Mercy for Animals shot the video while working on the farm in August and September. Aside from the whipping, kicking and punching, the video shows calves being tossed into the back of a truck and cows that can't stand being dragged with heavy equipment or lifted with clamps.

Unsettling: The dairy has since issued a statement, saying they have fired all employees and transferred thousands of cows to other dairies with good animal rights track records 

Hurtful: At one point in the video, baby calves are carelessly thrown into the back of a truck. The voiceover says many of the males will be killed for veal meat 

The group said the abuses uncovered during its investigations of six separate dairies around the country — including the New Mexico dairy — are all similar.

'So this isn't a matter of a single dairy farm failing to meet industry standards. This is a matter of industry standards allowing for blatant animal abuse,' said Matt Rice, the group's director of investigations. 'That's why we're calling on the industry to make improvements at all of its facilities to prevent this type of abuse.'

The Dairy Producers of New Mexico in a statement Wednesday said the industry is committed to animal well-being.

'The actions depicted in the video are unacceptable and do not reflect the daily care and comfort that New Mexico dairy farmers and dairy farmers nationwide provide their cows,' the statement said.

 Mercy for Animals is calling on Denver-based Leprino Foods, which is supplied by the New Mexico dairy and produces cheese for major pizza chains, to adopt a zero-tolerance policy for kicking, punching and shocking cows and require suppliers to provide safe and sanitary environments for the animals.

Leprino Foods said Wednesday it cares about the health and welfare of the animals on the farms that supply the company with milk and that it terminated all shipments from Winchester Dairy.
