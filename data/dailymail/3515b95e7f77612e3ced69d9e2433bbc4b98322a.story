Dramatic CCTV footage has captured the moment ram raiders steal a £120,000 vintage racing car from a showroom - and are gone in 60 seconds.

The gang were filmed smashing through the showroom window in a Land Rover Defender before using chains to frantically attach the classic Ford Escort Mexico to their 4x4.

One thief is seen getting behind the wheel of the stolen car before the raiders speed off with the vehicle in tow.

The stolen car, a blue Mk1 1972 Ford Escort Mexico, was taken from the Trackspeed Classic car showroom in Portsmouth Road, Ripley, Surrey.

The vehicle has the number 27 on its side and the registration plate DAD 422K.

Its owner, Mark McCracken, had been storing the vehicle at the showroom and says it was his 'pride and joy'.

The 46-year-old  said: 'It is the jewel in the crown of my collection. I fear it will be cut down and sold for parts - the body alone is worth £80,000 and the engine £40,000.'

'I am hoping anyone who has any information which could help with the investigation will be mindful to contact officers as soon as possible and help us piece together exactly what has happened to this distinctive vehicle.'

Police are investigating whether a Land Rover Defender found burnt out in West Horsley was involved in Tuesday night's ram raid.

Crime scene: The Ford Escort Mexico was stolen from Trackspeed Classic car showroom in  Ripley, Surrey

In May 1970 Ford entered a team of seven Escorts fitted with Kent engines into the World Cup Rally that ended in Mexico.

The team swept the board and came away with 1st, 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th positions - and the victory provided Ford with the ideal opportunity to launch a new production car from their UK plant.

In honour of the rally car triumph, they named this special edition road version the Escort Mexico.

The car has a maximum speed of just 100mph and does 0-60mph in 10.7 seconds.
