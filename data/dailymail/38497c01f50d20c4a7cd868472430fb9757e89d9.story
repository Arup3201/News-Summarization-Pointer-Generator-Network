A farmer who was offered £1million to put a wind turbine on his land turned it down because he said it would blight the 'beautiful and unspoilt' countryside.

But now Tony Dallyn, 54, who farms in a Devon valley made famous by Michael Morpugo's smash hit, War Horse, faces having to see the towering device anyway, because his neighbour has agreed to host the 251ft turbine instead.

And while it wouldn't have been visible to Mr Dallyn if he'd agreed to site it on his land, the proposed device will now be just 450ft away and highly visible from his house if neighbouring farmer, Martin Goddard, wins planning permission for it.

Mr Dallyn, who inherited his 1,800-acre farm from his parents in 1961, says he received offers from companies Murex and MI Grid to allow them to site a 500kW turbine on his Loosedon Barton farm.

He said he was told the device could earn him between £35,000 and £50,000 a year, or up to £1million over 20 years, but decided to say no as he would not be able to 'look people in the eye' if he destroyed the land near the Okement Valley, where War Horse author, Michael Morpugo, set his book.

He said: 'The papers were on the table ready to be signed to give a company a two-year option, but we decided we just could not inflict such a turbine upon our neighbours and wider community.

'It would have been a life-changing amount of money which could have financed the next step of the business, but the turbine would have towered above the hillside and been a huge blight on the landscape.

'I didn't want to be responsible - our farm is visible from everywhere north of Dartmoor and Okehampton into North Devon.'

Then Mr Dallyn discovered Mr Goddard's plans for a near-identical 250ft turbine on his land next door.

Around 100 local residents are objecting
 to the proposed turbine, including Mr Dallyn and Mr Morpurgo, 70, who 
has become the public figurehead for the valley's battle against 
turbines, describing them as a threat to its 'oasis of peace and 
wonder'.

Mr Morpugo wrote in a letter to the local authority: 'We will have a random scattering of thousands of these huge wind turbines all over Devon, all over our countryside...

'If our democracy means anything, this should not and must not be allowed.'

The plans are currently under appeal after being rejected unanimously by Winkleigh Parish Council and refused planning permission by Torridge District Council.

Mr Dallyn, who grows wheat and barley on his farm and hopes to pass the business on to his son, added: 'It is a lot of money to turn down, and I can understand why some people would take it.

'I just feel I would like to leave my small patch of England as beautiful and unspoilt as it was when I inherited it.'

Property developers began eyeing the Devon landscape last year after identifying it as a good location for a battery of new turbines, but campaigners warned the projects could ruin the scenery and wreck the tourist industry which inspired by War Horse.

A recent map drawn up by the Campaign to Protect Rural England revealed 11 turbines are currently in planning, with another nine in the pipeline.
