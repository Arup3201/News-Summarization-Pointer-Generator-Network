A lesbian woman who was allegedly beaten by her girlfriend's brother is defending her attacker and saying the assault was not a hate crime.

Mallory Owens, age 23, was attacked while eating Thanksgiving dinner with girlfriend Alex Hawkins' family in Mobile, Alabama on Thursday. 

Miss Owens' mother initially said that Travis Hawkins beat her because she disapproved of her sister's gay relationship. However, Miss Owens contends that was not the case.

'A lot of things have happened between us, but it doesn't make me hate her brother,' she told WKRG-TV on Tuesday. 'I don't hate her family at all, or anybody for that matter.'

Miss Owens, who was unconscious days after the attack, woke up on Tuesday and checked herself out of the hospital.

And she returned to her girlfriend's home - the same place where she was savagely beaten.

Miss Owens asked for her face, which is still horrifically mangled from the beating, not to be shown on camera on Tuesday.

'It's not a hate crime at all,' Miss 
Hawkins said. 'We both know the reason why this happened, and it doesn't
make any excuses for him, I'm not defending him at all. I know why he 
was angry, and that will come out.'

Neither woman elaborated about the 'real' reason behind the beating.

several days after the attack, receiving treatment for a broken nose in 
the beating that was so bad her eyes were swollen shut

Hawkins was arrested on Sunday and charged with second-degree assault, and later released on bond.

Family and supporters of Miss Owens believe those charges should be much more severe.

A
Facebook group entitled 'Charge Travis Hawkins Jr with the attempted 
murder of Mallory Owens' has sprung up on Facebook, garnering more than 4,600 'likes' since it was formed.

Hawkins' lawyer, James Byrd, told the
TV station his client, age 18, has been forced to go into hiding after 
numerous death threats.

'People have taken this and overreacted, and made it something that it's not,' Mr Byrd said.

Miss Owens' mother, Kristi Taylor initially told the TV station that Travis Hawkins allegedly beat her daughter because he disapproved of her gay relationship.

The accused: Travis Hawkins was charged with second-degree assault in the attack, and was later released on bond

'He tried to kill her. He's lucky he didn't kill her. She's lucky to be 
alive. I didn't recognize her when I got here. It's hard to look at her 
like that.'

Miss Owens was hospitalized and 
treated for a broken nose and numerous lacerations. Her eyes were 
swollen shut after the brutal beating and she had to receive facial 
reconstruction surgery.

Ms 
Taylor said that there was friction with the Hawkins family over the 
fact that her daughter was gay and had a relationship with the sister, 
which Hawkins reportedly did not approve of.

Despite the accusations, Hawkins 
cannot be charged with a hate crime because Alabama law doesn't include
sexual orientation among bias offenses, according to the 
Anti-Defamation League.

And Alabama is not alone, as 26 other
states are also without hate crime laws protecting members of the LGBT 
community, including Texas, Virginia and Missouri.

Earlier this year, Hawkins allegedly 
hit Miss Owens over the head with a pipe wrench. While she was injured 
in that attack, no charges were filed.

While Mallory Owens' attacker has been charged in the vicious beating, friends and family of the woman are shocked that additional charges have not been filed.

But despite the nature of the alleged beating, Travis Hawkins cannot be charged with a hate crime in Alabama.

The state's law does not include sexual orientation among bias offenses, according to the Anti-Defamation League.

And Alabama is not alone, as 26 other states are also without hate crime laws protecting members of the LGBT community.

In 2010, the FBI reported 1,470 offenses based on sexual orientation bias in Alabama.

Her mother told the station: 'I did not 
want her to go, I begged her not to go, knowing how the family felt 
about her. But she said, "They're trying to be nice."'

Miss Owens' sister Avery Godwin told AL.com that Hawkins called her on Friday to say 'that he would finish what he started last night with Mallory.'

Information about an attorney for Hawkins was not immediately available.

It’s also not the first time that police have been called to the Hawkins home.

Last year, Hawkins was hospitalized after he was allegedly shot in the chest by his father, Travis Hawkins Sr.

WKRG-TV
reported that the elder Hawkins was later released on bail and the case
was never brought to trial after his son refused to testify against 
him.
