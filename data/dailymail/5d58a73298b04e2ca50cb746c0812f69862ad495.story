All Souls' Day in the Philippines, known as Araw ng mga Patay - and All Saints' Day are the two most important days in the Filipino calender. 

Millions will soon flock to graveyards around the country to pay their respects to departed relatives and loved ones over the festival.

Families tend to light candles and clean crypts ahead of All Saints' Day celebrations on October 31. 

As the largest Catholic nation in Asia, this public holiday allows Filipinos to visit family crypts for overnight and weekend vigils.

Offices and schools close and the usually silent graveyards are transformed into parties with food and music. 

More than one million people are buried in the North Manila Cemetery including former presidents, national artists and movie stars.

There are at least 100 burials held here every week. 

According to a cemetery worker, the unclaimed skulls and skeletons are placed in a common grave after their 'lease' is finished to make way for more graves.
