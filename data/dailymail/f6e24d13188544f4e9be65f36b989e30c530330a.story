With hand washing rates astoundingly low in healthcare workers and costs related to hospital-acquired infections in the billions, some hospitals have turned to high-tech surveillance cameras and sensors to encourage better hygiene for their doctors and nurses.

When healthcare workers at Long Island, New York's North Shore University Hospital enter an intensive care room, for instance, a motion sensor is triggered. A camera is then turned on and its video footage sent to a center in India where workers watch to ensure proper hand hygiene is taking place.

Which is just to say, to make sure doctors and nurses are washing their hands prior to interacting with patients. As simple a task as it may seem in an environment where professionals are trained to make split-second, life-saving decisions, studies have shown hand washing rates in hospitals to be dismal.

Shocking: Studies show hospital workers need encouragement to wash their hands, with compliance rates as low as 30 percent in some hospitals

The New York Times says that studies show rates of hand washing in hospital workers prior to any type of patient interaction are as low as 30 percent without some form of encouragement.

The reasons for non-compliance are many. Philip Liang, who founded General Sensing, which provides sensor badges to hospital workers that track their hand washing, says an overburdened mind might be a chief reason.

‘Nurses have to remember hundreds—thousands—of procedures,’ he told the New York Times. ‘It’s really easy to forget the basic tasks. You’re really concentrating on what’s difficult, not on what’s simple.’

Liang’s product knows when a healthcare worker has neglected to wash his or her hands. A badge vibrates when the worker approaches a patient’s bed, gently reminding them to scrub up.

Dangerous: Hospital-acquired disease kills up to 100,000 per year and federal regulations will soon punish hospitals where preventable transmissions occur

Studies have also found that doctors, more than nurses or any other workers, are most resistant to washing their hands. The reason, according to the studies, seems to be a resistance to authority.

‘There are still staff out there who say, ”How dare they,”’ said Columbia University school of nursing’s Elaine Larson.

To root out non-compliance and avoid losing Medicare funding under new federal rules that punish hospitals where preventable diseases are transmitted, hospitals have begun instituting an array of hand washing encouragement techniques in addition to the high-tech surveillance.

Encouragement: Among other techniques, Beth Israel in Manhattan has its workers wear pins like these and officials say they really encourage patients to ask about hand washing

They are training hand washing coaches, hiring monitors who dress like hospital personnel and secretly watch for hand washing compliance, and giving out coupons for things like pizza and coffee to those who meet certain levels of compliance.

Subtle: 'You do not want to say, "You did not wash your hands,"' says Dr. Brian Koll of Beth Israel in Manhattan, where colleagues instead hand out red cards to non-complying workers, like a soccer match

Dr. Brian Koll of Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan trains compliance coaches. One of the techniques he uses, he borrowed from the sport of soccer.

When one worker notices another has not washed his or her hands, they can be given a red card by their colleagues.

‘It’s a way to communicate,’ said Dr. Koll, ‘in a nonconfrontational way that also builds teamwork.’

Dr. Koll’s hospital also has its workers wear pins that read things like ‘Ask me if I’ve washed my hands,’ ‘Got Gel,’ and ‘Hand hygiene first’ and Koll said patients’ families, especially parents of pediatrics patients, aren’t shy about asking doctors about their cleanliness.

At North Shore University Hospital, a 
2011 program saw the installation of digital scoreboards that record 
hand washing compliance rates for each shift. The intensive care unit 
saw a leap in hand washing rates.

Prior
to the scoreboards, the numbers hovered around 6.5 percent compliance. 
With them, they reached into the 80 and 90 percent range.

Workers
at places like Beth Israel who continue to exhibit bad hand hygiene can
be forced to take remediation classes. They must then, in turn, teach 
other non-compliant workers what they learned.

But for all the mild admonishments or coercion techniques, the real reasons for increasing hand washing rates is to save lives.

A recent CDC report says drug-resistant superbugs are on the rise and nearly 100,000 patients die each year from infections acquired in hospitals.

Effective: Some doctors are now under surveillance by observers in India who note hand washing non-compliance. Hospitals where workers know they're being observed have seen skyrocketing hand washing rates
