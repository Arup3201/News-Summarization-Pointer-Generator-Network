The scene could hardly have been more romantic as Vicky Pryce linked arms with her husband Chris Huhne while the sun set over the Aegean.

Yet as they posed as one big happy family for a wedding photograph in Greece, only Huhne could have known they were living one big fat lie.

To his trusting family, he was playing the dutiful stepfather as he gave away Georgia – his wife’s elder daughter from her first marriage.

Line-up: Vicky Pryce links arms with her husband Chris Huhne as a family photo is taken after the ceremony in Varkiza - the 'Athens Riviera'

Unsuspecting? Vicky Pryce and Chris Huhne at the wedding in Greece in September 2009

Little did any of them suspect that, back in Britain, he was cheating on his family with his bisexual mistress Carina Trimingham.

His double life was to blow the family apart and set his scorned wife on a path of revenge that culminated in them both facing jail.

But on that balmy evening in September 2009, shameless Huhne soaked up the acclaim as he basked in the role of a proud father of the bride at the ceremony in Varkiza – a posh suburb of the Greek capital known as the ‘Athens Riviera’.

He led 33-year-old Georgia down the aisle at the pretty cliff-top chapel where she married Ed Beesley.

Then Huhne lined up for photographs flanked by the bride and his wife Vicky, who looked happy and suntanned in a black and white African print dress and a pearl necklace.

Ambitious Huhne once openly boasted that his nuclear family would make him ‘such a photogenic prime minister’.

Role: The fact that Huhne had been chosen to give away his stepdaughter at her wedding shows the extent of his betrayal

As the sun went down and the traditional Greek festivities got under way, Huhne shed his jacket and joined in with the knees-up alongside his laughing wife.

He rolled up his sleeves in the heat of the evening and danced with his unsuspecting family on one of the happiest days of their lives.

The extent of Huhne’s betrayal is clear by the fact that he had been chosen to give away his stepdaughter at her wedding.

Georgia’s biological father, academic Gareth Pryce, split from her mother in the early 1980s before she met Huhne.

Georgia later gave a statement about the pressure her mother was under at the time she took the points for Huhne after he was caught by a speed camera.

She gave evidence in court for her mother at both trials.
