British holidaymakers have been warned that the seemingly innocent game of burrowing into sand dunes on beaches is an immensely dangerous activity which could kill them.

The warning comes after stunned lifeguards found a 7ft-deep tunnel in treacherous sand dunes at Constantine Bay, near Padstow in Cornwall.

No go: Lifeguards have issued a warning after this tunnel appeared at Constantine Bay

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) has warned holidaymakers not to dig into dunes anywhere along the British coast this summer – as they can be death traps.

Changing weather and damage done to dunes over the winter make them unstable.

‘Many sand dunes have altered dramatically over the last 12 months due to the winter storms,’ a spokesman for the RNLI says. ‘In hot weather the sand dries, creating an increased risk of collapse which could bury people alive.’

RNLI lifeguards discovered the latest tunnel, at Constantine Bay, earlier this month.

Although it was empty, a backpack had been left inside it.

The tunnel was roughly 7ft deep and just over 3ft high – meaning that children could easily have crawled inside.

Lifeguards quickly filled the hole using shovels to prevent anybody from getting trapped.

The RNLI has produced a new poster warning people to take extra care.

Steve Instance, RNLI senior lifeguard manager, thinks the tunnel is a worrying sign.

‘This is the first sand tunnel we've seen this year, and fortunately the lifeguards spotted it and were able to cover it over quickly,’ he says.

‘Clearly it could have collapsed at any time whilst digging it, or even whilst walking over it, with potentially fatal consequences.

‘Although the large cliffs of sand may look enticing playgrounds, we urge people to resist the temptation to play on them or dig into them.

‘The sand is very unstable and can collapse at any time, trapping anyone on or below it.

‘The areas of unstable dunes and cliffs are clearly signed on the beaches, and we ask people to take heed of this advice – as it's in their best interests for their safety.’

RNLI lifeguards began their peak season patrols last Saturday, meaning that all 57 life-guarded beaches in Cornwall will be patrolled, with lifeguard numbers increasing on some of the busier beaches.

Peak season runs until 7 September, and is predicted to be the busiest time for RNLI lifesavers as it takes in the school summer holidays.

The RNLI says that anybody visiting the coast should visit an RNLI life-guarded beach and swim only between the red and yellow flags, which marks out the safest bathing area.
