It's pretty crazy for me to be named with the other sports stars for the Sports Personality of the Year award.

I found out when my management company rang me. It felt amazing then but it didn't really sink in until the official announcement.

You've got to look at Lewis Hamilton and Rory McIlroy as favourites – their backing is massive. I'm just happy to be in the top 10, it's a great thing for me and for British athletics.

When I read through all the massive names on the list it feels unreal. I still consider myself young and that it's early on in my career, so to be recognised this year is amazing.

It's a massive confidence boost. It will push me on into next year. Hopefully I've got a lot more to give and I've got a lot more targets to hit.

I can't wait for the night. I'm bringing all my family and friends. They're really looking forward to it as well.

It's a shame my coach Scott Hann can't come because it's his wife's due date the day before. If he was there as well it would've been everyone who supported me and helped me get to where I am now.

We've already spent a day filming the video clip which will be used on the night. The first time I'll see it is when I'm there.

The 10 shortlisted athletes will all mingle in a room beforehand then we'll go out on stage.

Before then, I've got a bit of a break. I've been off on holiday and spent 11 nights in Jamaica with my girlfriend.

I was starting to feel pretty tired and needed a rest. I spend six or seven hours in the gym every day, about 35 hours per week. I love it and it's definitely worth it, but it's tiring.

I pretty much stay in the gym the whole year round. I even have to maintain it while I'm on holiday. When I was younger and went away if I didn't do anything I'd get back in the gym and it would take two weeks to get back into it because my wrists were sore.

So I do little bits every day, every morning, to maintain it. My brother made me some mini bars and I do bodyweight training on them for about 45 minutes a day.

I did it when my girlfriend was getting ready so it's OK!
