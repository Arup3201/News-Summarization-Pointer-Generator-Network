Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho thinks the FA should donate any football fines that he has to pay to charity.

Rather than going to watch the World Cup in Brazil this summer, Mourinho has been visiting hungry children and HIV patients in Ivory Coast as a United Nations ambassador for the World Food Programme.

The Portuguese said he wants football to do more to support initiatives like the WFP, and suggested the FA should donate his football fines to good causes.

‘I will pay it [a fine] with a smile if the money goes to the right place,’ he told ITV during his visit.

‘This is an experience, a real experience,’ the 51-year-old said while fighting back tears. ‘It is the kind of experience where I feel so little.

‘It hurts but sometimes that is good for the soul.’

The World Food Programme is the world’s largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide.

In May, Mourinho was fined £10,000 by the FA for sarcastic comments he made about match officials following Chelsea’s 2-1 defeat by Sunderland, a result which saw him lose his 77-match home unbeaten record.
