San Antonio Spurs power forward Tim Duncan made a powerful statement during his team's visit to the White House on Monday when he showed up to the presidential home without a tie.

The 38-year-old NBA veteran plainly stood out among teammates--all of whom wore neckties--as they lined up behind the Commander-in-Chief.

So does Duncan despise authority or dislike the president himself? Probably neither. If a 2005 quote is any indication, Duncan simply hates dress codes.

Barrack Obama deigned to shake hands with Spurs power forward Tim Duncan despite the NBA veteran's refusal to wear a tie to their meeting Monday

When the NBA instituted a dress code for its players that year, Duncan told reporters exactly how he felt about it, the Washington Post points out.

'I think it's a load of crap. I understand what they're trying to do with hats and 'do rags and [retro] jerseys and stuff. That's fine. But I don't understand why they would take it to this level. I think it's basically retarded,' he said.

He's also been noted by both Complex and Busted Coverage for his anti-fashion ways.

Despite his refusal to dress in line with tradition, Duncan was named specifically by the president as he welcomed the NBA champion San Antonio Spurs to the White House on Monday. 

Despite the demands of his Bulls fandom, however, the President admitted the Spurs were 'hard to dislike.'

'First of all, they're old,' he said of the squad led by 38-year-old Tim Duncan.

'For an old guy, it makes me feel good to see -- where's Tim? Tim's got some gray. There's a few others with a little sprinkles around here. There's a reason why the uniform is black and silver.'

Obama even specifically named the 38-year-old Duncan as he congratulated the team on for being NBA champs

Duncan was the only Spur not wearing a tie at the White House, where most people choose to wear ties

Fellow Spurs player Manu Ginobili told Washington Post sportswriter Michael Lee he didn't even try to coax the fashion-hating (nearly) 7-footer to wear a tie

As a father of two daughters, one of whom plays basketball, Obama praised the Spurs as the first NBA team to hire a woman assistant coach, and welcomed the wealth of international talent the team has brought to the league.

'It's the UN of basketball teams,' he said of a squad that features French players Tony Parker and Boris Diaw along with Argentina's Manu Ginobili. Italy, Brazil, Australia and Canada are also represented on their roster.

'They find folks who didn't have a chance someplace else and suddenly they figure out a way to make them shine as part of a team. In that sense, they're a great metaphor for what America should be all about,' said Obama, who was presented with a Spurs jersey with 'POTUS' written over its number one.

The keen basketball fan also offered some serious analysis of the Spurs' style and its influence on the league, and praise for their bounce back from a crushing NBA finals loss to Miami in 2013, to beat the Heat in 2014.

But he couldn't resist poking some fun at notoriously taciturn coach Gregg Popovich.

'I want the coach to know that he is not contractually obligated to take questions after the first quarter of my remarks,' Obama said.

Duncan has long been known as an anti-fashion type. He also hates dress codes. In 2005, he called the then-new NBA dress code 'a load of crap'
