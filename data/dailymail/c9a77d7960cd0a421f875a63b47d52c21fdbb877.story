Former Australia seamer Glenn McGrath has lamented the standard of death bowling in the early stages of the World Cup.

England coach Peter Moores admitted his bowlers needed to improve after they conceded 105 runs in the final 10 overs during their opening defeat to Australia.

But England's problems have been put into some context by the fact that the average number of runs scored in the final 10 overs, when completed, in the opening five games of the World Cup is a whopping 112 runs.

Australia's equal leading one-day international wicket-taker McGrath believes bowlers have forgotten the 'art' of a yorker at the death and suggested he would have been able to combat new-age shots such as ramps and reverse sweeps.

'It still comes down to execution. In the final 10 overs if you can bowl good yorkers at will, and pretty much hit them, then you are going to be successful,' McGrath, a three-time World Cup winner, told Cricket Australia's website.

'It seems that because people have put the ramp in that bowling yorkers at the death is a dying art, which just bewilders me.

'The new shots have come in but I felt that I probably could have combated that. Bowling comes back to executing and being able to bowl the ball where you want to bowl.

'If you can do that you are going to be successful in any era.'

Moores conceded after England's 111-run defeat to Australia that his side had under-used the yorker.

However, the 52-year-old believes his bowlers' greatest crime was not bowling to their field as they were instead lulled into a shorter length to try to make Australia hit to the longer boundaries on the off and leg sides at the MCG.

'The yorker is a really good ball, but you've got to bowl the right ball to the right field,' Moores said.

'If you look at the stats for the best in world cricket, they don't just bowl yorkers - but they do bowl yorkers. They bowl simple plans.

'(Australia pace bowler Mitchell) Starc is a yorker bowler, but some are not and they bowl a heavy length with slower balls. You have to go to your strengths.

'So we have certain bowlers who lend themselves to going full with yorkers; others won't use it quite as much.'

England play their second game against New Zealand on Friday in the smaller surrounds of the Westpac Stadium - which is primarily a rugby venue - and in the coming days Moores is set make clarifying his bowlers' plans in the late overs a priority.

'We have to go away, look at that and decide what are we going to do?' he said.

'How are we going to get clear on that? We have to move and we have to move fast because these games are going to keep coming - and the last 10 to 15 overs aren't going to go away.'

Moores will tell his bowlers not to try to double bluff the New Zealand batsmen who, with the likes of Corey Anderson and Luke Ronchi down the order, have built a reputation in for big hitting late.

'The key for whoever bowls at that time is to be clear and committed in what they're trying to do - and then bowl to their field,' Moores said.

'Now that's a tough thing. There are only four men out, rather than five, so that's harder and what I don't think you do is try to double bluff people.

'You bowl to the field you've set and back your skill levels to get the ball in the right area to make it very difficult for them to get past the boundary man.'
