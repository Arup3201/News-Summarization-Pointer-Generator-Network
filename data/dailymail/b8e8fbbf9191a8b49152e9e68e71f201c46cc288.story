The body of a 31-year-old woman missing since her raft overturned in Colorado on Saturday was found on Thursday by her own brother.

Amanda Taylor, 31, who was living in Vernal Utah, was whitewater rafting on the Arkansas River when she was tossed from the dinghy in the pitch black at around 10 pm when the boat missed a ramp and became stuck under a waterfall.

He family rushed from their homes in Wyoming to help with the rescue and Taylor was discovered by her brother Beau Taylor only three miles from where she fell in.

An autopsy performed on Thursday confirmed that she had tragically drowned when she and six others lost control of their raft in rapid waters.

Five made it the shore and authorities rescued another 22-year-old man clinging to the raft.

Undersheriff John Spezze said that search and rescue teams had scoured as far as 30 miles downstream and along the river's banks for Taylor, but the murkiness of the water made visibility difficult.

The discovery of Amanda's body by her brother after four days of searching came after the involvement of five different local agencies.

Amanda Taylor's brother spotted her body hanging on a branch close to the riverbank where the South Arkansas River meets the Arkansas River.

He positively identified her when other search teams arrived and he and other family members held Taylor's body where it was found to stop it floating downstream according to The Mountain Mail.

Bess said Taylor’s body must have recently floated down to where it was found after search teams had come through the area on rafts earlier.

Other rafter's where much luckier than tragicTaylor.

David Torchia, 22, was treated for bruises and hypothermia after he clung on for dear life to the raft when it flipped over.

'That was a near-death experience I didn’‍t think I’‍d be getting out of,' said  Torchia, who is a camp consultant at the summer at Rocky Mountain Village Easter Seals Camp in Empire, Colorado.

'We were all being tossed around. It felt like being in a washing machine, being tossed around and turned around without any control of things.'

Torchia said to the Toldedo Blade that the waterfall kept everyone pinned under in the water and the lack of light caused confusion in reaching the shore, but that everyone was wearing a lifejacket.

Sheriff deputies said Mr. Torchia and his companions John Spalvins, 54, of Alex Marzec, 22, Ashley Noble, 21, Jill Bryant, 53, and John Wallace, 22, set off at around 4pm to arrive at the Salida boat ramp at 10pm.

Apart from Torchia and Taylor, the other five were plucked from the water and pulled to safety.
