A Pennsylvania felon who fired a handgun into his neighbor's house told the judge at his arraignment it was because he didn't know how to unload a handgun.

George Byrd IV, 31, was hauled in front of a judge Friday after police found a handgun and a few rounds of ammunition in Byrd's home following a call that shots were fired into a neighbor's house.

The Bucks County Courier Times reports that a Middletown resident called police around 12:30 p.m. Friday after hearing gunshots. 

Pleading ignorance: George Byrd IV, 31, was found shirtless at his home after a neighbor charged he fired a gun into her home

According to the police affidavit, the woman reported that she found a window had been shattered on the porch to the rear of her home.

A half hour later, as she was inspecting the damage, she saw a shirtless man come out of a home whose backyard faces hers and, raising a handgun, apparently fire in the direction of her house.

A search by police found two bullet holes in the fence between the two residents.

Middletown Police Detective Patrick Nicastro inspected the damage to the resident's porch and pulling back the siding, found a medium caliber bullet.

Officers then visited Byrd, finding him shirtless, and detained him while the home was searched, though Byrd denied firing shots. 

According to the probable cause affidavit, the search turned up several rounds of handgun ammunition in the basement of Byrd's home.

With a search warrant that was obtained, police eventually found a .357 revolver, 12-gauge double barrel shotgun and an M77 rifle.

Byrd has a felony conviction stemming from a burglary committed when was 17, which would prevent him from legally possessing a firearm.

In front of a judge, Byrd stated his case that he had fired his gun into the ground to clear the chamber because,in spite of the three firearms in his home, he was unfamiliar with guns and didn't know how to unload one.

He is currently in custody at Bucks County prison facing charges of persons not to possess firearms and discharging a firearm into an occupied structure.
