European vice-captain Sam Torrance believes the American team will be plagued by doubts when they contest the 40th Ryder Cup at Gleneagles.

US captain Tom Watson has made it clear that he feels this year's contest offers those players on the wrong end of the 'Miracle at Medinah' the chance of redemption.

But Torrance thinks the manner of that defeat in Chicago, when Europe fought back from 10-4 down on Saturday afternoon and from 10-6 behind in the final day singles, will have a negative effect.

'If it was me I don't think that would spur me on,' Torrance said.

'I would think that would put a lot of doubts in my head, the fact that you're four points clear at home and you lose.

'I don't know how that would spur you on, it's almost more deflatory.'

Europe have won seven of the last nine contests and not lost on home soil since 1993, but Torrance does not subscribe to the theory that the United States need a win to maintain interest in the biennial contest.

'Not in my book,' the 2002 winning captain said. 'If they never win again I'll still be very interested. They want it just as much as we want it. That's a point that you really must get over.

'They love the Ryder Cup like all Europeans. They really want to win it back just as much as we want to retain it and that's what makes it such a fantastic sporting event.'

Seven of the 12-man team from Medinah - Bubba Watson, Webb Simpson, Keegan Bradley, Phil Mickelson, Zach Johnson, Jim Furyk and Matt Kuchar - have also made the side for Gleneagles, while wild card Hunter Mahan has his own score to settle having lost the decisive singles match to Graeme McDowell in 2010.

'I made it very clear to them that this trip is a redemption trip,' Watson said.

'Those players that played on that team, it's time to make amends and try to redeem yourselves from what happened in 2012. I think it's a motivation rather than a negative.'

The US team arrived together on a flight from Atlanta on Monday morning, while members of the European team made their own way to Gleneagles.

Both sides were due to have their first official practice sessions on the course on Tuesday.
