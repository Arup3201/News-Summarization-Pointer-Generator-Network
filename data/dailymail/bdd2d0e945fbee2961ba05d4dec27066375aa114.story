Cuba has released pictures of Fidel Castro for the first time in six months in an attempt to prove the ailing former leader is not dead.

The images showed the 88-year-old former leader at his home along with his wife Dalia during a meeting with the leader of a students' union.

Speculation over his health has intensified since the announcement by his younger brother - current president Raul Castro - and US President Barack Obama, that the two longtime adversaries would restore diplomatic ties.

The images come after weeks of speculation concerning the Cuban revolutionary leader's medical condition after he disappeared from the public eye

Castro was silent after
the announcement until finally commenting a week ago, when he
offered lukewarm support for the pact.

The pictures of Castro with student leader Randy Perdomo
were taken on January 23 and appeared  on the website of the Communist Party
newspaper Granma on Monday night.

The headline says 'Fidel is extraordinary.' The photos show Castro wearing a blue sweat-suit with a blue-checked collared shirt.

The images come after weeks of speculation concerning the Cuban revolutionary leader's medical condition. 

The last time he was seen in public was January 8, 2014, when he attended an art gallery opening near his home.

Rumours of Castro's demise have cropped up often since he stepped down from office during a health crisis in 2006.

Raul Castro, the longtime armed forces chief, took his brother's place at Cuba's helm.

The Granma article said that the meeting between Castro and the student leader came four days before Castro finally broke his silence on the diplomatic breakthrough with the US. 

It added that, although he was wary of his old enemy Washington, he did not oppose it and viewed the historic change as a 'positive step'. 

Perdomo said his talks with Castro were as if he were talking to an old friend.

He said he got a call the night before from Castro and was moved when he finally heard a voice he had often heard from afar.

'How are you, Randy,?' said Castro, according to Perdomo.

Last week the communist leader met with a Brazilian theologian, Frei Betto, who advocates liberation theology - the idea that it is the Catholic church's responsibility to help the poor.

'The commander is in good health and in good spirits,' Betto said the next day. But no photos of the meeting were published.

Castro took notes on what Betto said, according to the Brazilian.

Betto said he found the former Cuban leader 'in good health, thin but lucid.'

Speaking last week Castro appeared to lend his support to talks with the U.S. but stopped short of an enthusiastic endorsement of the move.

'I don't trust the policy of the United States nor have I had an exchange with them, but this does not mean ... a rejection of a peaceful solution to conflicts or the dangers of war,' Fidel Castro said in a statement published on the website of Granma.

'Any peaceful or negotiated solution to the problems between the United States and the peoples or any people of Latin America that doesn't imply force or the use of force should be treated in accordance with international norms and principles,' Fidel Castro said.

'We will always defend cooperation and friendship with all the peoples of the world, among them our political adversaries.'

He took power in a 1959 revolution and spent much of his 49 years in power railing against the United States, which never succeeded in many attempts to oust him. 

In mid-January Castro sent a letter to Argentina football legend Diego Maradona - a friend of his - and this also eased fears that he was on his last legs.  

Castro stepped down from power due to poor health, handing
over to his brother provisionally in 2006 and definitively in
2008. Though he receives visitors, he has not appeared in public
for more than a year. 

He currently lives, as he has for years, in a quiet suburb of western Havana called Jaimanitas, with police permanently blocking the street to his house, which is codenamed Punto Cero (or 'Point Zero') by Cuban intelligence.

He has eight children in total and a dozen grandchildren.

He has lived in increasing seclusion from the outside world ever since he retired as Cuba's leader in 2008.

Shortly afterwards, it was reported that he was suffering from diverticulitis, a digestive disease. He is cared for by his wife and, it is believed, by a team of nurses.

In January, he attended the opening of an art gallery exhibition dedicated to Cuban artist Alexis Levya.

It was his first appearance in nine months and official newspapers carried photos of a grey-haired Castro, hunched over and leaning heavily on a cane as he pointed at the art on display.

Photos of him in meetings with foreign leaders were published as recently as July.
