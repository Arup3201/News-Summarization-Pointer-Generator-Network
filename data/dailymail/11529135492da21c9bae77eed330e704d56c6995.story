An Islamic extremist faction has claimed 
responsibility for kidnapping a group of builders allegedly including a British national from a construction site in Nigeria.

A
group calling itself Ansaru issued a statement today claiming it has 
taken one British citizen, one Greek, one Italian, three Lebanese and 
one Filipino working for a construction company in the West African country.

The group, which has been linked to the previous abduction of Briton Christopher McManus, warned that Nigerian and European authorities should not 'act contrary to our conditions'.

Mr McManus was held by his captors for 10 months before he was killed when a failed rescued attempt was launched. The link will cause further alarm for the safety of those kidnapped in this latest raid.

Radical Islamist group Ansaru - pictured speaking from an undisclosed location in November - have claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of seven foreigners in a deadly raid on a construction site in northern Nigeria at the weekend

Location: A British builder is believed to be one of the seven workers kidnapped from a construction site in Jama'are in the Bauchi state in northern Nigeria

Police said gunman attacked a local prison  in Jama'are, near Bauchi, Nigeria, burning two 
police trucks, before targeting a workers' 
camp for Setraco, which is building a road in the area.

They said seven foreigners working for Lebanese construction company Setraco were taken after the gang killed a guard at a site in Bauchi state in the north of the country late on Saturday.

Bauchi police spokesman Hassan Muhammed said: 'The gunmen came with explosives, which they used to break some areas.'

Ansaru's statement claimed it committed 
the abduction 'based on the transgression and atrocities shown to the 
religion of Allah by the European countries in many places such as 
Afghanistan and Mali'.

The extremist group Ansaru, pictured in November 2012, have previously claimed responsibility for kidnapping a French national and have been linked to the abduction of British Christopher McManus in May 2011

Franco Lamolinara, right, were killed by their captors after Nigerian 
troops and UK special forces attempted to rescue them. Their kidnappers have been linked to Ansaru

It is stressed that any 'attempt or 
act contrary to our conditions by the European nations or by the 
Nigerian government will' endanger the hostages, the statement read.

The statement offered no conditions, suggesting the group would later contact authorities to make a ransom demand.

Police and security officials in Nigeria did not immediately respond the statement.

Ansaru declared themselves as a breakaway group from Boko Haram - the north's main terrorist group - in January 2012.

Boko Haram, whose name means 'Western education is sacrilege', has launched a guerrilla campaign of bombings and shootings across Nigeria's predominantly Muslim north. Boko Haram is blamed for at least 792 killings last year alone, according to an AP count.

Ansaru's aims are unknown - but they have a different message from Boko Haram, according to Raffaello Pantucci, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute.

Foreign embassies have issued travel warnings over northern Nigeria for months. 

Abduction fears have risen in recent weeks with the French military intervention in Mali, as its troops and Malian soldiers try to rout out Islamic fighters who took over that nation's north in the months following a military coup. 

Last week, the U.S. Embassy in the capital of Abuja put out a warning following the killings of polio workers in the northern city of Kano and the killing of the North Korean doctors.

‘The security situation in some parts of Nigeria remains fluid and unpredictable,’ it said.

'They seem to disagree with some of 
Boko Haram's strategies - in particular, they disagreed with Boko 
Haram's tendency to kill Muslims,' Pantucci said.

'They seem to be more internationally
focused, they talk a lot more in global jihad terms and they seem very 
eager to cultivate that side of their image. It makes them more 
dangerous.'

Ansaru has previously claimed 
responsibility for the December kidnapping of a French national working 
on a renewal energy project in Nigeria's northern Katsina state.

Britain also linked Ansaru to the May
2011 kidnapping of Christopher McManus, who was abducted with Italian 
Franco Lamolinara from a home in Kebbi state.

The men were held for 
months before their captors killed them in March 2012 during a failed 
Nigerian military raid backed up by British special forces in Sokoto, 
the main city in Nigeria's northwest.

Authorities initially blamed Boko 
Haram for the kidnapping, something that it denied. That apparently 
represented the birth of the group, whose motivations remain murky, but 
whose threat is increasingly real for foreigners in northern Nigeria.

Foreign firm: Setraco is an engineering construction company that has existed for more than 35 years and has 'played a key role in developing Nigeria's infrastructure', according to its website

It has been linked to Al Qaeda but there's no evidence to connect the two terrorist groups.

In November, Britain's interior 
ministry announced that a parliamentary order that makes membership in 
or support of Ansaru a criminal offense.

Last month around 40 hostages, six understood to have been Britons, were killed in an attack on the In Amenas gas field in Algeria.

Some 29 of the hostage-takers died, while three were captured by Algerian troops during a special forces mission to end the four-day stand-off which began on January 16.

In the wake of the crisis, Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to put terrorism 'right at the top of the agenda' for Britain's presidency of the G8 nations this year and vowed to show 'iron resolve' in tackling Islamist threats.

A Foreign and Commonwealth Office 
spokeswoman said: 'We are aware of reports that a number of foreign 
nationals, including a British national working for a construction 
company, were abducted on the evening of February 16 in Bauchi state. We
are in contact with the Nigerian authorities.'

Italian authorities said the safety 
of its hostage must be given 'absolute priority', while Greece's foreign
ministry said it had a plane on standby to send investigators to 
Nigeria.
