Charged: Former PCSO Peter Bunyan is on trial at Taunton Crown Court, charged with abusing his position to have affairs with five women and having sex with them while on duty

A police worker accused of having sex with several women while on duty was no worse than John Major, a court heard yesterday.

The lawyer defending Peter Bunyan, a married police community support officer, compared his client to the former prime minister, who had an affair with Edwina Currie.

Bunyan is accused of neglecting his duties by turning down his police radio on shifts before having sex with women he met through work.

He also allegedly accessed highly sensitive police data to perform background checks on the women, some of whom had mental health issues, and their former partners.

Yesterday his defence lawyer, Michael Melville-Shreeve, told the court Bunyan was a ‘rat’ – but said the prosecution case was ‘piffle’.

He said: ‘The prosecution say if he’s off duty having sex with these women: not misconduct. If he’s on duty, if he’d stopped off to have tea with them or coffee with them: not misconduct.

But if he has sex with them, it is misconduct. Why? How is that?

‘He [Bunyan] is a rat. He’s a disgrace as a married man. But somehow, my learned friend [prosecution counsel Simon Burns] wants to turn that into criminal misconduct.

‘If it’s not serious crime to have tea with someone for half an hour, it is not a crime to have sex consensually with them.’

Referring to the four-year affair between Sir John and former minister Edwina Currie, Mr Melville-Shreeve said: ‘What about John Major and Edwina Currie?

‘She’s even written a book about it. That was a public office. I don’t know if it was on duty or off duty. I don’t know whether a prime minister is ever off duty.’

He continued: ‘I remember people were raucous about those Conservatives. But it is not a crime. Nobody ever called for their prosecution.’

Bunyan, a father of two, denies 12 counts of misconduct in a public office, over a five-year period in the Camborne and Redruth areas of west Cornwall.

Of the five women he is accused of sleeping with, he admits having sex with four, but said it happened in his own time.

All of the women said the sex was 
consensual. Earlier, prosecutor Mr Burns had argued that Bunyan, of 
Carharrack near Camborne, ‘was not there when the public needed him’.

He told the court: ‘He abused his position as a police officer.

‘He’s targeted vulnerable individuals
who are either people who have suffered from mental issues or 
individuals who have been at the receiving end of violence.

‘He has conducted sexual relationships, totally and utterly inappropriately, while on duty.

‘He’s ignored police radio transmissions while on duty, while turning down the radio or turning it off.

He added: ‘He has accessed the police computer 
system without legitimate policing purpose. It is clearly a conflict of 
interest with his work.’

But Mr Melville-Shreeve described the
prosecution case as ‘piffle’, saying: ‘The police are desperate to get 
him [Bunyan] because he is one of their own.’

He added: ‘[Bunyan] is a disgrace to the uniform. He should be publicly humiliated. But he’s not a serious criminal.’

Bunyan, who has been suspended from Devon and Cornwall police, denies all charges. The trial at Taunton Crown Court continues.
