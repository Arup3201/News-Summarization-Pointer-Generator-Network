Muslim leaders yesterday launched an unprecedented appeal to would-be young British jihadists: Don’t travel to fight in Syria and Iraq.

Some 100 imams asked the UK’s Muslim community to help prevent radicalised youngsters joining militants abroad.

Muslims should continue the ‘generous and tireless’ support for those caught up in the bloodshed – but from the UK in a ‘safe and responsible way’, they said.

The call was made by leaders from different Islamic theological backgrounds and was echoed by imams during Friday prayers. It came as claims emerged yesterday that up to three Al Qaeda instructors tutored by master bomb-maker Ibrahim Al-Asiri are believed to have slipped in to Syria to teach British and other Europeans jihadists to make ‘stealth bombs’.

And a British man who claims he has been fighting in Syria told the BBC he will not return to the UK until he can raise ‘the black flag of Islam’ over Downing Street and Buckingham Palace.

Speaking with a northern accent, the man, who called himself Abu Osama, said he had received military training, making bombs and fighting with the extremist Al-Nusra Front, linked to Al Qaeda.

He claimed to have been fighting for the establishment of a caliphate – which he referred to by the Arabic term Khilafah – across the Islamic world. ‘There is nothing in Britain – it is just pure evil,’ he said.

‘If and when I come back to Britain it will be when this Khilafah – this Islamic state – comes to conquer Britain and I come to raise the black flag of Islam over Downing Street, over Buckingham Palace, over Tower Bridge and over Big Ben. I don’t want to come back to what I have left behind.’

Osama said he initially faced opposition from his family but they now ‘understand that this is a good cause I am in’.

It emerged yesterday that there are already believed to be three Al Qaeda instructors trained in bomb-making in Syria. It is feared they are poised to tutor young British Muslims who have travelled there in the art of making ‘invisible bombs’ – non-metallic devices that can get past airport scanners and can even be stitched inside a suicide bomber’s body.

Security officers are said to have identified more than 100 of the 600 Britons currently fighting in Syria while US investigators have given their UK counterparts ‘dozens of names of interest’.

However the US, which has demanded increased security at British airports, also accused the UK of ignoring for too long the threat posed by men like Osama.

Frank Gaffney, former assistant secretary of defence under Ronald Reagan, said British governments ‘turned a blind eye’ to recruitment operations and ‘embraced extremists’. He said of the Western jihadists in Iraq and Syria: ‘What they learn there are the skill sets to bring violence to us.’
