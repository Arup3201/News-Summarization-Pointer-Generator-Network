If you were to randomly shout out the name of an animal, it's likely outback adventurer Andrew Ucles has caught it.

From snakes to  crocodiles and even sharks, the 26-year-old YouTube sensation from Wollongong, 60km of south of Sydney, has found his own unique way of snaring animals.

Now, he has released a wacky video in which he uses venomous snakes to lure rabbits out of their burrows.

Andrew Ucles has used snakes to capture rabbits

In the video, which has been viewed over nine million times since it was uploaded, Ucles showcases his distinctive capturing style, leading many to question his actions. 

Starting off his video, Ucles can be seen roaming around the outback with his top off, wearing only a pair of shorts and sneakers.

‘I know I’ve got a s*** haircut but I’m trying my best to blend into the natural surroundings,' Ucles says to the camera, marching his way through the bush. 

Realising that his bare hands may not be enough to catch the quick rabbits, Ucles goes on the hunt for some snakes to help him trap the furry creatures.

Opening up into a swamp, Ucles searches all around him for snakes and it isn't long before he comes across his first one. 

‘I don’t know how people can step on a snake, it’s so obvious,' he says to the camera, picking up a red-bellied black snake with one swift move. 

Seemingly unperturbed by the fact that red-bellied black snakes are highly poisonous, Ucles carries on his snake hunt,  grabbing two more red-bellied snakes by the tail, much to the reptiles' disgust.

Wriggling around in his hands, Ucles takes the opportunity to tell viewers that the red-bellied snakes are as as quick as lightening and when held upside down they can reach their tail in a matter of seconds. 

He then drops one snake into each of the burrows and waits for the terrified rabbits to come running out

Trying to hush the two trapped snakes by whispering 'settle down', Ucles moves on, suddenly coming across one of the most dangerous snakes in the world - a tiger snake.

Reaching behind the agitated tiger snake, Ucles picks it up by the tail, now holding three deadly venomous snakes in one hand and the fourth most dangerous snake in the other. 

Ucles explains that you have to pick your moments with snakes and it's all about the skill and tact. 

To ensure he captures some rabbits with his snake friends, Ucles makes sure he has strategically placed special nets over the tunnel of burrows.

Careful not to encounter a snake on its way out of the burrow, Ucles reaches down and frees the rabbit, delighted that he has proved his method works. 

He is quick to point out that no rabbits were hurt in the making of the video and the rabbit that was caught was released back into the wild. 

Ucles graduated with a Bachelor of Environmental Science and currently studying a Masters in Wildlife Management.

He says he draws inspiration from wildlife lovers such as Bear Grylls and Steve Irwin and believes humans should interact with animals on a daily basis.

According to his official website, he has been teaching himself how to capture some of Australia's most dangerous wildlife since he was seven-years-old. After school he would take mates into the bush and teach them how to catch capture animals.

While he has been bitten many time by snakes, it has not deterred the young man from continuing to document his journey. 

He is expected to be the next big phenomenon, with his YouTube channel audience reaching over 45 million and it is rapidly climbing.
