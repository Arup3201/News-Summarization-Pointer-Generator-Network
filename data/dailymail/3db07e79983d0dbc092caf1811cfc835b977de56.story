Pictures have been released of the original Winnie-the-Pooh - after whom the real-life Christopher Robin named his now-famous childhood teddy bear.

The black-furred bear, a female named Winnipeg, was smuggled in Britain during the First World War by Canadian lieutenant, Harry Colebourn.

After the soldier was sent to fight in France, the bear cub was given to London Zoo, where it was watched and loved by AA Milne's son, the real-life Christopher Robin.

Century-old images of the original Winnie-the-Pooh, who gave his name to the world famous children's character, have emerged

Colebourn was among troops traveling through Canada on his way to warring Europe in 1914, when he saw the bear for sale in White River, Ontario.

It is believed he bought the cub for just £12 from a hunter who had killed the creature's mother.

He called it Winnipeg after his home city in Manitoba, central Canada.

The soldier then sneaked the bear into Britain and it became an unofficial mascot for his regiment, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade, who trained on the Salisbury Plain.

The black and white images show Lieutenant Colebourn playing tame cub Winnipeg, who was very popular among his fellow soldiers

When Lieutenant Colebourn was transferred to France, he gave the bear to London zoo, where it became a popular attraction and lived until 1934.

It was while the Canadian black bear was being exhibited at the zoo that AA Milne's son, Christopher Robin, observed her playfulness and decided to change the name of his teddy bear from "Edward Bear" to "Winnie the Pooh."

This name change provided the inspiration for Milne's stories about Winnie-the-Pooh - a character who first appeared in 1924, 10 years after Colebourn brought the bear to England.

The pictures were released ahead of what would have been the original bear's 100th birthday this year.

A statue of Colebourn and his bear Winnie now stands in Assiniboine Park in Winnipeg and another statue, of the bear alone, features at London Zoo.

'If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day, so I never have to live without you.'

'It is more fun to talk with someone who doesn't use long, difficult words but rather short, easy words like "What about lunch?"'

'People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day.'

'I'm not lost for I know where I am. But however, where I am may be lost.'

'Some people talk to animals. Not many listen though. That's the problem.'
