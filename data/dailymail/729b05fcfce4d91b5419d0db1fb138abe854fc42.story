Terrifying surveillance footage from Sunday morning shows the moment a pregnant Manhattan woman fought off an attempted rapist as she walked her dog in broad daylight.

The video shows a man who appears to be in his 20s approaching the woman from behind as she strolled the sidewalk at around 7 a.m. on 212th ST. in the Inwood neighborhood.

Pouncing upon his startled 30-year-old victim, who is two-months pregnant, the man attempts to rip off her clothes and reach into her shorts, but the brave lady is able to fight him off as she cries for help to passers-by.

Followed: The lady (whose face has been blurred) is being trailed by the man (visible behind her)

The video then shows the man running away. The suspect was dressed in a white T-shirt, denim shorts, sneakers and a red baseball cap and appeared to be 6 feet tall and 180 pounds.

NYPD have not yet apprehended the man and have appealed to the public for help.

The suspect, who had been sitting on a park bench, grabbed her from behind as she walked her dog.

NYPD officials said the man tried to shove his hands down her shorts and beat a hasty retreat when she bit his chest and screamed for help.

Moving In: The woman bends down to check on her dog while the would-be rapist approaches the lady in Manhattan

Terrifying: The man tried to bear hug the woman - who begins to thrash wildly

Saved: The man stops his rape attempt as members of the public rush to the ladies help

A superintendent of a nearby apartment building heard her screams and came to her aid.

The attacker fled.

The
police released the surveillance footage in an effort to catch the 
woman - and her face has been obscured to protect her identity.

'It’s a pretty shocking thing to have something like that happen in 
the neighborhood,' one resident told WCBS 880′s Marla Diamond.

'Believe 
me, this is not the safest neighborhood in the city, but I’ve never seen
something so brazen.'

'We need to take kickboxing, karate, whatever to defend ourselves,' said a woman who works nearby.

This comes as another woman in Brooklyn faced off an armed assailant at gunpoint who tried to abduct her early on Monday morning.

The 27-year-old was depositing money at a Chase Bank ATM in Carroll Gardens when she saw a man following her in his car.

The driver pulled over two blocks later and aimed a gun at her, pistol whipped her and then tried to pull her into his car.

The victim was released when she began to fight him and started screaming. She suffered minor injuries and police have not yet apprehended the man.

Anyone with information about either attacker is asked to contact the NYPD Crime Stoppers hotline:
