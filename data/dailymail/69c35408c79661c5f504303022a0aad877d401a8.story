The thrilling Olympic athletic heat 
which ended in a tie will be re-run today to decide which runner will 
make it to the Games in London this summer.

The two female sprinters involved in 
the dead heat were offered the chance to decide their fate with the toss
of a coin, but opted to rely on their athletic ability instead.

However, Jeneba Tarmoh insists that 
the winner-take-all race - which will be held at 5pm local time at 
Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon - is unnecessary, as she won fair and 
square.

The young sprinter wants no part of a
run-off with training partner Allyson Felix to settle the last spot for
the Games in the women's 100 metres.

Too close to call: Jeneba Tarmoh (bottom) and Allyson Felix both cross the finish line for the Olympic trials with a time of 11.068. The race is decided by when their torsos cross the line, and the picture showed a tie

'In my heart of hearts, I just feel like I earned the third spot. I almost feel like I was kind of robbed,' Tarmoh said.

Tarmoh was originally declared the 
third-place finisher of the event on June 23, even going on a 
celebratory lap around the track, being presented a medal and then 
showing up at a news conference.

Only after her drug test did she discover the controversy - race officials had declared a dead heat.

Now, after not making the team in the
200m, Tarmoh has to regroup and step up to the starting line, trying to
reclaim a spot she believed rightfully belongs to her.

Battle: The track timer had initially named Tarmoh, right, as the winner before officials reviewed the results

'I'm not that excited at all. This 
decision was really hard for me to make,' said Tarmoh, who is eligible 
to run on the Olympic 400m relay team.

'I was pushed into a corner. They 
said if you don't make a decision, you give your spot up. I work too 
hard to just give my spot up. I had to say it was a runoff.'

The controversy in the 100 
overshadowed the entire trials simply because USA Track and Field had no
protocol in place to deal with a dead heat. USATF officials quickly 
scrambled to adopt a tiebreaking procedure.

The athletes had a choice between a 
runoff or a coin flip. They chose to settle matters on the track, not 
with the flip of a quarter.

'They both feel they deserve a spot 
on the team and they're willing to do it in a competitive manner and a 
competitive fashion,' USATF President Stephanie Hightower said. 'I think
it's good for the sport and it's good for them to show their level of 
competitiveness and passion and drive for what they've been working so 
hard to accomplish.

'The bottom line is that this is, in my opinion, the best way to be able to resolve this issue.'

Disbelief: The two women finished dead heat for the third position on the women's 100m Olympic team

The resolution was delayed for eight 
days because their coach, Bobby Kersee, wanted to wait to make a 
decision until after 200m on Saturday. Felix turned in a personal-best 
time of 21.69 seconds, the fourth-fastest by an American.

'I didn't get to really enjoy it,' 
Felix said. 'As soon as I came off, that's the first time that I 
actually thought about the process. Of course, I wasn't thinking I 
wanted to do a coin toss, but that's the first time I sat down and went 
through things in my head.

'Once this is over, I'll be happy about it.'

After two races and six rounds, both 
will be running with fatigued legs - so much so that Felix said she 
won't take any chances. If she steps into the blocks and does not feel 
right, she will pull out of the competition.

'We're both not feeling our greatest,' Felix said.

For Tarmoh, there is also an emotional component.

'I went to bed so happy and then I 
woke up to do something I don't want to do at all,' Tarmoh said. 'If 
it's in the best interest of someone's job or the sport, that's what 
I'll do.'

Support: The two women have the same trainer and
contracts with Nike

Anxious: Felix (right) is keen to compete in the Olympic 100m even though her main event is 200m

Tarmoh's agent Kim Holland was asked if there might be any sort of legal recourse should her clieent not win the race.

'I'll have a sidebar conversation 
with Jeneba and see how she wants to proceed, meaning if it's really 
over with the run,' Holland said.

Tarmoh indicated the matter would be concluded with the runoff.

'I wouldn't want to pursue anything else,' she said. 'This has been a long road already.'

As for their friendship, Felix said 
it has not been affected by the situation. They both train under Kersee 
and were practicing starts together leading up to the 200m.

'There's never any question about any of that,' Felix said.

Since Felix had already earned a spot
in the 200m, there was speculation she might simply concede the 100m to
Tarmoh. But Felix said the 100m is vital to her preparation for the 
200m, where she's a favorite to win Olympic gold.

'People may wonder, "What in the 
world? Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (of Jamaica) ran 10.70 and you're nowhere
close to that,"' Felix said. 'But it's about making my 200m better and 
giving it my all.'

The runoff is a boon for track and will be shown on NBC in conjunction with the network's coverage of the swimming trials.

'This will reintroduce people to the 
sport and showcase world-class athletes and great competition,' newly 
hired CEO Max Siegel said.
