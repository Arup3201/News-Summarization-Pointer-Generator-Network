Looters are compounding the anguish of grieving relatives in  the MH17 massacre by using bank  cards and mobile phones stolen  from the dead.

The shocking development emerged yesterday as emergency workers trying to reclaim missing body parts at the crash site were chased away by heavily-armed pro-Russian rebels accused of   downing the Malaysia Airlines flight.

The Boeing 777 was destroyed by a missile killing all 298 people on board while flying over the separatist-held Donetsk region a week ago.

Since then, the site has been one of astonishing chaos, with bodies looted, evidence sabotaged and valuable aluminium metal plane parts being stolen and sold for scrap.

Yesterday, it emerged that the widow of one of the ten Britons killed had been forced to cancel her husband’s credit cards to stop their fraudulent use.

Reine Dalziel, the wife of British helicopter pilot Cameron, a 43-year-old father-of-two, was ‘stunned’ by the shameful abuse of her dead husband’s belongings. Her brother Shane Hattingh said: ‘People are abusing it in the Ukraine. They have no respect for each other, look what they’re doing. It made me angry beyond words.’

Mr Dalziel, who had just moved to Malaysia with his family, was killed while on his way home after taking a training course. His wife was said to be ‘destroyed’ following his death.  Mr Hattingh said her whole body was ‘sore from crying’.

He added: ‘The little we do know is that Cameron was in business class, and that particular part of the plane was found reasonably intact.

‘So we can only hope that things will work out for us and that we can get Cameron home and start the grieving process.’

Meanwhile, relatives have told of their horror after their loved ones’ phones were answered by strangers with ‘eastern European-sounding voices’. New footage also shows rebels stealing golden  wedding rings and other valuables from the scene.

Yesterday, flights continued to carry victims’ bodies from the government-controlled Ukrainian city of Kharkiv to the Netherlands for identification.

New evidence has also emerged that the rebels allegedly planned to sabotage the investigation by contaminating the site with parts from other planes

But forensic experts say just 200 corpses and an unspecified number of body parts have been sent to them by rebels from the crash site in the eastern farming village of Grabovo, which is unsecured and now largely deserted.

There are fears that vital evidence has been lost as the site is sabotaged and plane debris – including the jet’s mangled cockpit – moved around and stolen to be sold as scrap metal.

Remaining body parts have also been left to rot and destroyed by wild animals in the summer heat.Yesterday, the head of Ukraine’s emergency services, Serhiy Bochkovskiy, said officers were forced away from the site by the rebels who confiscated their equipment.

Jan Tuinder, a forensics expert leading the Dutch investigation, said what was happening at the scene was ‘criminal.’

He added: ‘There are still some lunatics, it’s very hard for us to get to the bodies.’ Australia has sent a team of 50 policemen to London ready to fly out to try to recover remaining body parts.

Rebels have promised secure access to the site for investigators but fighting was yesterday getting worse in the area.

Meanwhile, a decree allegedly signed by rebel commander Igor Strelkov was issued stating that valuables taken from bodies must be handed in to contribute to the ‘defence fund’ of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic.

Jordan Withers, 22, the nephew of British crash victim Glenn  Thomas, 49, said: ‘It’s a hard one to swallow — that my uncle and everyone else’s loved ones are there and they are being degraded and treated inhumanely.’

Ukrainian government adviser Anton Gerashchenko yesterday said looters were stealing valuable aluminium from the site.

Andrei Lysenko, of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, said: ‘The cynicism of these gangsters has no limits. According to our information, apart from picking up valuable personal belongings of the passengers, terrorists are using credit cards of the victims.’

Last night Ukrainian prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk announced his resignation following widespread criticism of his  government’s inability to secure the crash site.

Russia 'bears responsibility' for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, U.S. intelligence officials said, but they offered no evidence that Vladimir Putin was directly involved.

The senior intelligence officials were cautious in their assessment, noting that while the Russians have been arming separatists in eastern Ukraine, the U.S. had no direct evidence that the missile used to shoot down the passenger jet came from Russia.

The plane was probably shot down by an SA-11 surface-to-air missile fired by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, the intelligence officials said.

U.S. intelligence chiefs have found no evidence of Vladimir Putin's direct involvement in the shooting down of MH17 but said Russia 'bears responsibility' for the disaster

They also said that after analysing taped phone conversations between separatists obtained by U.S. intelligence it could be all but concluded that the culprits did not realise they were targeting a commercial airliner.

'Five days into it [following the crash] it does appear to be a mistake,' one official said.

The officials briefed reporters over intelligence related to last week's air disaster, which killed 298 people.

It comes a day after the first pictures emerged of damaged panels from MH17, which appear to show evidence of shrapnel and missile damage.

They cited intercepts, satellite photos and social media postings by separatists, some of which have been authenticated by U.S. experts.

Separatists previously had shot down 12 Ukrainian military airplanes, the officials said

But the officials said they did not know who fired the missile or whether any Russian operatives were present at the missile launch.

They were not certain that the missile crew was trained in Russia, although they described a stepped-up campaign in recent weeks by Russia to arm and train the rebels, which they say has continued even after the downing of the commercial jetliner.

In terms of who fired the missile, 'we don't know a name, we don't know a rank and we're not even 100% sure of a nationality,' one official said.

White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said the US was still working to determine whether the missile launch had a 'direct link' to Russia, including whether there were Russians on the ground during the attack and the degree to which Russians may have trained the separatists to launch such a strike.

'We do think President Putin and the Russian government bears responsibility for the support they provided to these separatists, the arms they provided to these separatists, the training they provided as well and the general unstable environment in eastern Ukraine,' he said in an interview with CNN.

He added that heavy weaponry continues to flow into Ukraine from Russia following the downing of the plane.
