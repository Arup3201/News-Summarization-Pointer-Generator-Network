Responsible? The girl's mother, whom police had not identified, was present at the home when the shooting took place. Her boyfriend, Adrian Chavez, 22, who was also at the home, fled the scene and was apprehended five hours later, police said

A 3-year-old Colorado girl was shot and critically wounded by a 5-year-old boy on Monday with a handgun belonging to her mother's boyfriend, police said.

Pueblo police said in a statement that a 9-year-old boy was playing with a handgun in the backyard of a home in the morning when he gave the firearm to the 5-year-old, who pointed it at the girl and fired, striking her once.

The bullet entered and exited the toddler's body without breaking any bones, police said. She was airlifted to a Colorado Springs hospital where she was listed in critical but stable condition after having surgery, they added.

'When the 
9-year-old was asked how he was able to manipulate the handgun, he said 
he learned it from video games like Black Ops,' police said.

The
 two boys who handled the gun will not face charges, because of their 
age, police said, but they would investigate how the older boy got the 
weapon.

The
 girl's mother, whom police had not identified, was present at the home 
when the shooting took place. Her boyfriend, Adrian Chavez, 22, who was 
also at the home, fled the scene and was apprehended five hours later,

A 3-year-old girl was shot outside a home in Pueblo Monday morning

According to police, the girl was shot by a 5-year-old child, but it was another 9-year-old child who was able to get the gun from inside the home

'Chavez
 will be charged with child abuse resulting in serious bodily injury for
 the gun that was left unattended,' police said, adding that he had an 
outstanding, no-bond warrant for failure to appear in court in an 
unrelated case.

The initial investigation indicates that a 9-year-old child was able to get hold of a handgun that was in the home.

The 9-year-old was in the backyard of the Colfax home with the other children and was able to manipulate the gun. The gun was then handled by a 5-year-old who pointed it at the 3-year-old and pulled the trigger.

When the 9-year-old was asked how he was able to manipulate the handgun, he said he learned it from video games like 'Black Ops.'

Neighbors say the tragedy didn’t surprise them.

'None whatsoever,' neighbor Michelle Hernandez said to KRDO news.  Her husband agreed.

'We thought it would more likely be a kidnapped kid or a kid getting run over in the street,' Matthew Hernandez said.

The child was shot a single time, and the bullet entered and exited without breaking any bones

The victim was flown to a hospital in Colorado Springs for treatment. She¿s listed in critical but stable condition

The Hernandez’s say it was common to see the kids running around, unsupervised for hours.  The couple was so concerned about them that last week they say they contacted the Department of Social Services.

'I don’t know if it was naïve to think that OK, I called the Department of Social Services, I emailed a director, surely something will happen…they’ll step in the house, they’ll intervene,' Matthew said.

But they say they never saw a caseworker pull up to the home.  So when they saw police today, there were regrets.

'I think we should have called the police.  I regret not doing that first to have them do a welfare check,' Michelle said.

Police say the five and nine-year-old boys won't face any charges because of their age. Investigators are still deciding if the girl's mother should be charged.

Pueblo Police say hiding a gun from your kids somewhere in the house, just does not work. It’s best to always lock them up.
