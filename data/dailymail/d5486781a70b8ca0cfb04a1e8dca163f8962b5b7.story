Wilfried Zaha has admitted he must improve his game if he wants to resurrect his Manchester United career.

Zaha will be hoping to impress new boss Louis van Gaal in the early hours of Thursday morning when United take on LA Galaxy in the first game of their pre-season tour of America.

'It’s great to be back,' Zaha told manutd.com. 'There’s a nice vibe, everybody’s working hard and we’re looking forward to the new season.

'For me, I definitely feel like this is a clean slate.

'All I’m trying to do is impress the new manager and get into his squad. All I can do is give my all. There’s a new manager and I want to make sure I show him what I can do.'

When Moyes named Zaha in his Community Shield team last August, many expected the winger to hold down a first-team place for the rest of the season.

However the 21-year-old did not start a league match for United as Moyes decided the player was not good enough.

After a 13-game loan spell in Wales, Zaha feels he has improved.

'I’ve realised there are things about my game I need to work on and concentrate on and I know this is the best place to be if I want to improve,' added Zaha.

'I really want to make myself a better player. Going to Cardiff was a really good experience for me.

'I managed to get quite a few games under my belt at Premier League level, which was good, and I feel like I’ve come back a better player.'
