An Ohio 17-year-old girl has been arrested after she allegedly pulled a prank by tying herself up and covering her mouth with duct tape before having a boy drive her to a Taco Bell drive thru. 

The teenager was seen by the Akron Taco Bell workers as she sat bound with duct tape inside a Ford Explorer a friend was driving. 

Concerned staff member Ashley Boyer, 19, called the police just before midnight on Wednesday and alerted them of what looked to be a kidnapping because 'the female passenger gave her a look like she needed help'.

A 17-year-old girl and a male friend were arrested after faking a kidnapping in a Taco Bell drive through and later told the police they did the prank because 'they were bored'

Police spent several hours trying to find the SUV, according the the Beacon Journal. 

The questioned the couple, who told the police that they were 'bored and just playing around'.

The girl and the driver have not been identified because they are juveniles each facing a misdemeanor charge of delinquency by means of inducing panic.

This comes after Akron Police announced earlier this week that a man who has relieved himself on nearly 20 cars over a period of two years is being sought by the city. 

The latest incident took place in Akron early on Wednesday morning. The culprit was photographed by a resident who happened to see the man in action. 

Last month a group of people were arrested after a mother, grandmother, aunt and her co-worker were arrested for staging the kidnapping of the mother's six-year-old son to teach him a lesson about stranger danger.  

The incident took place Troy, Missouri, where Lincoln County sheriff’s deputies say the child was lured into a pickup truck by the co-worker while he was walking home from school.

Once inside the truck, Firoved told him he would never ‘see his mommy again’, and he would be ‘nailed to the wall of a shed’ Fox 2 reported.

The crying child was then shown a gun and threats were made to hurt him if he did not stop crying.

The boy’s hands and feet were then bound with plastic bags and he was blindfolded with a jacket. 

His aunt then removed the boy’s pants, told him he could be sold into sex slavery and shouted at him for not resisting either her or Firoved.
