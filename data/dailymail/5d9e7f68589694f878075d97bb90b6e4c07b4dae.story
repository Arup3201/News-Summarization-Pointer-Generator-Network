Train delays mean Ella Porter often has to go to bed without a cuddle from her daddy.

But rather than complain to him, the six-year-old went to the source of the problem instead – and wrote a letter to rail bosses.

And now Ella's moving letter, addressed to 'Dear Mr Railway Man', has been backed by thousands of people after her father Neil posted a picture of it online.

She wrote to Southern Rail bosses: 'My daddy is always late home and I miss him very much. Please get him home on time. Daddy says you take all his money that is why I can't go to Disneyland. I really want to go to Disneyland.'

Short on time: Neil and Michelle Porter with Ella, wrote the letter to railway bosses, and baby Charlie

Ella decided to contact the company because her father, who commutes daily from Uckfield in East Sussex to London Bridge, is often held up by delays. 

Southern's services have been in a state of chaos for two weeks since a new timetable came in which has led to trains being regularly delayed, suspended or cancelled.

And according to official Network Rail figures, none of Southern's 7.29am trains between Brighton and London Victoria reached the capital at the scheduled time of 8.35am last year.

Ella's note, written in black biro and carefully checked for spelling mistakes, even caused many social media users to contact Southern Rail directly, demanding Ella be treated to a holiday in Paris. 

One Twitter user, Hannah Lloyd-Roberts, wrote to the rail company and Mr Porter: 'Hope your daughter gets more daddy time and Disney.'

Mr Porter also tweeted the company to say: 'I think @SouthernRailUK should compensate my daughter for her time without her dad.' 

Neil Porter's six-year-old daughter, Ella, has written to rail bosses to ask them to stop delaying her father's train

Neil Porter spends just over £4.000 a year commuting to from his home in Uckfield, East Sussex, to London Bridge

The 35-year-old, who also has a baby son, Charlie, with wife Michelle, 41, spends £4,000 a year travelling to work as a graphic designer at entertainment firm Mind Candy in Shoreditch, East London.

Mr Porter, who also runs his own card-making business, said: 'At six years old Ella is already a strong-headed young girl!

'I love spending time with her and she gets upset when I miss her bedtime.

'Unfortunately this has happened a lot as of late because of Southern Rail and their long delays. I hope they get back to Ella with a response and sort out the trains so I can spend some time with my family.'

Last night, one of the peak-time trains between London and Uckfield had six coaches instead of eight, causing one commuter to post a picture online of a packed carriage and write: 'Six carriages on peak Uckfield line service. People crushed. Think some got left behind at platform.'

Yesterday, Southern Rail apologised to Ella – but failed to mention anything about her Disney hopes. 

A spokesman added: 'Trains to Victoria and London Bridge travel over the most congested part of the whole of Britain's railway network and we are constantly pushing against the boundaries of what is physically possible on the infrastructure to provide as much capacity as possible to and from London.'

Southern has apologised to Mr Porter's daughter, Ella, for repeatedly delaying her father's train 

Commuters are set to experience disruption and overcrowding at London Bridge Station for the next 18 months whilst it undergoes major rebuilding work.

The 178-year-old station is the oldest surviving rail terminal.

It is due to be rebuilt as part of the £6.5billion Thameslink programme and is expected to take three years.

The building work has seen the closure of platforms one to six at the station.

As a result services run by the Southeastern train company to and from Charing Cross station will not call at London Bridge main line station until August 2016. 

A new timetable was also introduced at the station for Southern and Thameslink services, which has led to major disruption. 

Once the work is completed the station will be able to up capacity by 65 per cent, Network Rail said.
