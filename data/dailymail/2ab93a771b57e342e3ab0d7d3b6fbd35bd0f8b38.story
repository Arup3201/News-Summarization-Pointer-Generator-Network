Mike Ford was left to rue Bath's failure to claim a bonus point in their win over Montpellier on Friday.

Bath led by 30 points with half an hour left to play but couldn't find a fourth try, despite the introduction of Sam Burgess for his European debut.

They must now rely on Glasgow and Toulouse if they are to have any chance of reaching the knock-out stages.

Bath coach Ford said: 'I unleashed the bench after 50 minutes and I thought we had enough time to get that bonus point.

'We are unbelievably frustrated that the game turned so scrappy.

'Hopefully Glasgow and Toulouse can take points off each other.'

England outside half George Ford kicked 15 points as he continued his excellent form from the autumn internationals.

Montpellier had flanker Antoine Battut and captain Thibault Privat sent to the sin bin in the first half.

It allowed Henry Thomas to score for the visitors before Bath were awarded a penalty try just before half-time.

They only had to wait eight minutes of the second period for their third try through number eight Leroy Houston.

But Montpellier rallied on with a try from Alex Tulou despite replacement hooker Charles Geli becoming their third player sent to the bin.
