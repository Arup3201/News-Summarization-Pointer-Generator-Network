A pensioner has been killed in a public park after a PC apparently left the handbrake off and the police van rolled forward.

The pensioner was buying ice creams in Pudsey Park, Pudsey, West Yorkshire, on Saturday afternoon when the Ford Transit struck him.

Two walking sticks and a pool of blood remained at the scene as the Independent Police Complaints Commission investigated the incident.

Donald Bennett, 83, died when he was hit by the two tonne van as he sat on a wall eating an ice cream

Two police officers - a female and male constable - had been responding to report of youths causing trouble in the park at 2.15pm and had parked up the West Yorkshire Police vehicle on a hill before making their way to speak to a group.

But within seconds the van apparently rolled forwards and ran into the OAP, who had been sat on a wall in the sunshine.

West Yorkshire Police said: 'At 2:15pm on 1 June 2013, a police van responded to reports of a disturbance in Pudsey Park, Church Lane in Pudsey.

Two police officers had been called to the scene after complaints of youths in the area

'The officers attending went into the park and left their van to deal with the incident.

'The van subsequently rolled forward and collided with an elderly man walking in the park. Paramedics were called to the scene, but the man died of his injuries.

'The matter was immediately referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.'
