Just about recovered from the Ice Bucket Challenge? Prepare yourself to take on the latest charity challenge that's sweeping social media.

The After Eight challenge sees participants attempt to slide a chocolate down their face and into their mouth without the use of their hands in the quickest time possible. They are then encouraged to donate money to charity and nominate three more people to try to beat their time.

The concept is the brainchild of Liverpool legend, Kenny Dalglish, who has been using his connections in the sporting world to get stars to undertake the charity challenge.

He is asking participants to donate money to the Marina Dalglish appeal - a cause he set up in his wife's honour after she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2003. 

As of Thursday, ex-Westlife singer Nicky Byrne has smashed the record after he managed to get the chocolate from his forehead into his mouth in just 2.88 seconds.

Kenny himself held the crown until Monday, with a time of 5.44 seconds, but was also beaten by Coleen Rooney and Jamie Redknapp with 3.0 seconds and 3.5 seconds respectively.

Footballing heroes Matt le Tissier, Alan Hansen and Ian Ayre (CEO of LFC) are also showing their support to Kenny and Marina by participating and donating to the appeal. 

And it looks set to spread even further afield after footballers Adam Lallana, Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Brendan Rogers were nominated. David Beckham has even been nominated by his ex-England teammate from the 90s, Matt Le Tissier.

Are these two next? David Beckham has been nominated - so will he take part and nominate his wife Victoria?

Speaking about the appeal, Kenny said: 'It's fantastic to see the support from all these stars spreading. Nicky Byrne has done a great job of stealing the current challenge crown.

'The challenge is really fun and the appeal is so important for helping women affected by breast cancer. Don't forget to donate when you take part.' 

Marina Dalglish added: 'It is fantastic to see people are getting behind the charity and having such a lot of fun doing it. But we mustn't forget the real reason for this challenge, to raise money for those affected by breast cancer. The contribution is incredibly important to those affected, so please donate generously.' 

The couple, whose services to charity have been recognised with many awards, have raised £1.5m for a Chemotherapy Centre at Aintree and Fazekerley Hospital, £3.1m towards a Radiotherapy Centre at Aintree and £500,000 towards a new Chemotherapy Centre at Southport and Formby Hospital. 

Their new challenge is to raise £2m for an MRI scanner to treat brain tumours.
