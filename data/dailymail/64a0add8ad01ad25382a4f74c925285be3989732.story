EARLY CAREER

15 – Played in his first European Tour event, the Daily Telegraph Dunlop Masters, aged only 15. Darren Clarke secured him an invitation after McIlroy, an amateur, won the West of Ireland Championships. 

At the time, Clarke said: ‘Rory has a special talent and I have no reservations about seeking an invitation for him to play. I am sure he will enjoy and benefit from the experience.’ 

McIlroy shot rounds of 82 and 81 and missed the cut.

18 – McIlroy turned professional aged 18 in September 2007 having won the silver medal for low amateur at The Open earlier in the summer. He played his first event as a professional at the British Masters and finished 42nd, earning £12,063. 

By comparison, Tiger Woods turned professional aged 20, immediately signed endorsements worth £40m and hit a hole-in-one on his pro debut at the Greater Milwaukee Open, albeit only finishing 60th in the process.

£220,000 – the amount McIlroy earned in prize money in his first month as a professional.

114 – After McIlroy’s first year on the European Tour he was ranked 114 in the world. He broke into the top 100 on October 19, 2008 and entered the top 50 in November of that year. He has not left it since.

BREAKTHROUGH ERA

19 – McIlroy won his first professional event at the Dubai Desert Classic on February 1, 2009, aged 19. The win took him to 16th in the world ranking and earned him £258,000. That year he scored his first top-10 major finish, at the 2009 US Open

70 – 70 days later, McIlroy won his first major at the US Open, setting a US Open record low score of 16 under par. It made McIlroy the youngest US Open winner since Bobby Jones in 1923 and took him to fourth in the world.

GIRLFRIENDS

2 – Rory McIlroy is known to have had two girlfriends over the course of his career. He broke up with childhood sweetheart Holly Sweeney in 2011 and started dating tennis player Caroline Wozniacki.

£120,000 - McIlroy proposed with a diamond ring on New Year’s Eve but quite famously broke off his engagement to Wozniacki in the days after sending out wedding invitations. 

Rumours have since linked him to several women, though last week he said his upturn in form was down to being single and dedicating more time to golf.

RECORD MAKER

3 – McIlroy’s win at the 2014 PGA Championship makes the 25-year-old the third youngest golfer to win four major championships, after Tiger Woods (24 years and seven months) and Jack Nicklaus (25 years, two months and 21 days). 

McIlroy was 25 years, three months and six days. For historical conext, Walter Hagen and Gary Player won their fourth majors at 29.

20 – McIlroy is now tied 20th on the list of all-time major winners with four. McIlroy’s hat-trick of Open, WGC and PGA Championship means he is the first player since Tiger Woods in 2007-08 to win three straight PGA events, though he would need to win his next two to match Woods’s incredible five-title streak.

3 – McIlroy now ranks as the third most successful European golfer in major championship history. Only Seve Ballesteros (five) and Sir Nick Faldo (six) have won more.

MONEY

£31,000 – the amount fetched at auction for the golf ball with which McIlroy won the 2014 Open at Hoylake.

£14,500,000 – the amount McIlroy is believed to have earned between June 2013 and June 2014, with £12m coming from endorsements and £2.5m in prize money. That takes in one of the most disappointing spells in McIlroy’s career after he switched his equipment manufacturer to Nike.

However, he has emerged as the world’s best player and that long-term Nike deal is rumoured to be worth £10m a year. In 2013, he was the 35th highest earning sportsmen, but with 2014 prize money of roughly £4.2m he will shoot up the next list. His major sponsors include Nike, Bank of Santander, Bose and Omega.

£28m – The Sunday Times Rich List estimated McIlroy’s fortune to be worth £28m

£6.7m – the value of McIlroy’s Florida mansion, which has six bedrooms and nine bathrooms. He has also been pictured driving a white £300,000 Lamborghini Aventador
