The woman behind a paternity suit against NBA great Michael Jordan remains adamant Jordan is her son's father and remains committed to refiling after dropping the case because she neglected to remove her ex-husband's name from the birth certificate.

Pamela Smith filed the suit against Jordan in February and asked that the basketball hall of famer take a 
paternity test and pay child support.

The Georgia woman and lawyer Randall Kessler abruptly dropped the case March 15, but Kessler told the Associated Press her client 'stands by the facts alleged in her original filing.'

At the time, Jordan's spokeswoman 
Estee Portnoy said no settlement was made nor was any money paid to 
Smith. She said the lawsuit had no merit.

Now, TMZ has reported that Smith dropped the case because of a legal technicality.

Namely: her ex-husband is listed as the father on 16-year-old Taj's birth certificate, not Jordan.

A lawyer for the majority owner of 
the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats previously said Smith's divorce filings also 
established her ex-husband as the father.

Kessler said the lawsuit was withdrawn without prejudice, meaning it can be refiled.

Kessler previously said the ex-husband hasn't paid child support or been involved in the teen's life.

She also said Smith, who filed the original case herself, without the help of legal counsel, simply didn't know what she was doing.

Smith 'began this case without an attorney and did her best to file what she believed to be a legally appropriate case,' Kessler said in a statement.

'She then hired our firm just before the first court appearance. Ms. Smith has relied on our advice and determined that dismissal at this time, without prejudice, is in her son's best interests.'

The
teen, who uses the surname Jordan, has in the past taken to the 
internet to insist that the former Chicago Bulls star is his father.

According to TMZ, the woman was 
hesitant to bring Jordan's name through the mud but her teenage son 
begged his mother do everything she could to get Jordan to acknowledge 
that the boy was his son.

Jordan is scheduled is marry fiancée Yvette Prieto April 27.

His ex-wife Juanita Vanoy scored what may have been at the time the largest celebrity divorce deal in history.

And Jordan, determined that he won’t make the same mistake again, has reportedly had his fiancée sign a prenuptial agreement that protects all of his $650 million fortune.

The star remains one of the most 
recognized sports figures in the world nearly 10 years after his 
retirement from the NBA and is considered by many to be the greatest basketball player of all time.

He was a 14-time NBA all-star, won six championships with the Chicago Bulls and was named the finals MVP six times.

On March 17, 2010, the NBA Board of 
Governors unanimously approved Jordan's purchase of the Bobcats, making 
him the first former NBA player ever to become the majority owner of a 
league franchise.

This is not the first time he has been 
the subject of a paternity suit - in 1991, his former lover Karla Knafel
claimed the star was the father of her child, but a DNA test proved 
that this was not the case.
