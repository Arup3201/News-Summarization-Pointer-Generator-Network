An iPad app that launched today allows brides-to-be to try on up to 300 different wedding gowns without setting foot in a store.

First, users must upload a full-body shot to the Wedding Dress Studio app, which is free to download, and adjust their shoulder and hip points.

Then they can choose from various silhouettes, necklines, fabrics and embellishments, and see the dress overlaid on their picture.

Say yes to the dress: The Wedding Dress Studio app lets brides-to-be 'try on' nearly 300 gowns to figure out what styles are most flattering

Founder Hillary Sica, 25, tells MailOnline that she wanted to make the task of finding the perfect dress 'A bit easier and a bit more fun' for women.

'Searching for the perfect gown can be very overwhelming, and while I haven't personally experienced this yet, I can absolutely draw from the experiences of family/friends around me. It's a once in a lifetime purchase, and quite a large one at that,' she says.

The designs offered on the app are intended to reflect the most popular bridal styles at the moment.

Featured silhouettes include A-line, ballgown, empire, column and mermaid, and users can choose from a strapless, bateau, V-neck asymmetrical, off-shoulder or halter neckline.

There are also eight different color variations and 22 embellishments, such as bows, flowers, belts and brooches.

Miss Sica, who is based in New York City,
 recommends that users wear something formfitting in the photo they use 
with the app so as not to interfere with the edges of dress.

She adds that the app uses 'fabric remapping technology,' which will recognize the user's frame and allow the fabric of the chosen dress to remap and contour realistically to their body shape and stance.The app allows the final design to be saved and shared on social media.

Miss Sica says the app has already been tested with about 200 users, and she plans to add other categories, such as maid of honor and mother of the bride.
