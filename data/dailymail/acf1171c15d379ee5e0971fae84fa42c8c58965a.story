Police are searching for leads after a top transportation official for the Washington D.C. area was found shot dead inside his home on Monday.

Ronald Kirby, 69, had been shot multiple times in the torso when a relative discovered him around 12.30pm in the home in Alexandria, Virginia, just hours after he had last been seen alive.

There were no obvious signs of a forced entry and investigators are now searching for anyone who would want to harm the beloved and respected director of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments transport department.

Loss: Transport official Ronald Kirby, 69, was killed in his home in Alexandria, Virginia on Monday

'This was a very prominent citizen in a quiet neighborhood who finds himself the victim of a homicide,' Alexandria Police Chief Earl Cook told WJLA - but refused to say if Kirby had been specifically targeted.

'We donâ€™t know that at this point,' Cook said. 'It's too early to eliminate any possibility.'

But he added: 'Current investigation does not indicate there's reason for neighbors or citizens to be overly concerned about violence.'

Kirby, a married father of two teenage children adopted from the Philippines, had served the COG for 26 years and was celebrated by his colleagues for his 'deep knowledge and wise counsel'.

'He was a trusted colleague and a dear friend to all of us at the Council and his associates around the region,' a statement said. 'We extend our deepest sympathy to his family at this difficult time.'

Chuck Bean, the COG's executive director, said in a statement: 'One
of the region's leading experts on transportation planning, (he) was a 
key figure in all aspects of our work on regional planning and 
collaboration.'

Scene: Kirby was found by a relatives on Monday afternoon, hours after he was last scene alive. Officers returned to his home, pictured, on Tuesday to hunt for more clues as to who shot him dead

D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson added: 'Few
people understood our transportation problems and needs as well as Ron - he was the go-to guy for transportation.'

Kirby, who was originally from Adelaide, Australia, enjoyed playing tennis, taking dance classes with his wife and walking to the waterfront, longtime colleague Robert Griffiths told the Washington Post.

He told the Washingtonian Magazine in 2004 that he loved D.C.'s 'rich culture' after a simple upbringing by a father who worked as a butcher, 
electrician and movie-theater projectionist.

But he took most pleasure from his work.

'He really enjoyed what he was doing day 
in and day out,' Griffiths said. 'He said he couldn't see himself 
sitting at home reading books. It was the intellectual engagement with 
our board and with elected officials that he really enjoyed.'

Kirby's murder is the city's 5th this year; there were no recorded murders in 2012.
