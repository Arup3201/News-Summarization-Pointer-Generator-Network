For many mothers, the school run can be one of the most stressful parts of their day.

Spare a thought then for Melissa Stowe, who faces a four-hour journey involving 12 buses to get her daughter Olivia to and from school after the little girl was turned down by primary ten minutes from their home.

When the four-year-old starts school in September, Miss Stowe, 22, will have to take three buses from their home in Methley, Leeds, West Yorkshire to drop her off in Allerton Bywater, and three buses back.

Long journey: Melissa Stowe faces a four-hour journey involving 12 buses to get her daughter Olivia to and from school after the little girl was turned down by primary ten minutes from their home

Miss Stowe will then have to repeat the exhausting 
two-hour round trip - along with eight-month-old baby Daisy and her pram
 - when she collects Olivia at the end of the day.

Miss Stowe had applied to get Olivia into the reception class at her nearest school in Methley, which is just 10 minutes walk from the family’s home.

However, the school, which has been rated 'outstanding' by Ofsted is massively oversubscribed and she lost an appeal.

Olivia cannot get in, even though she is already at the nursery there.

Olivia
 has now been placed on the waiting list, and at an appeal hearing Miss Stowe was told there is nothing she can do but wait for a place, if one becomes available.

The school where Olivia has been offered a place is 4.7 miles away by road, but school places are allocated 'as the crow flies' - with that distance being 1.78 miles away.

Route: Miss Stowe will have to get her first bus at 6.50am, travelling from Methley to Whitwood. From there she will go to Castleford and finally on to Allerton Bywater to drop off Olivia

Neither Miss Stowe, nor her partner James Sheard, 24, drive.

Miss Stowe also cares for her disabled mother, which makes her situation even more difficult.

'We did two test runs of the journey and Olivia was completely exhausted,' Miss Stowe said.

'We will be setting off just after my partner leaves for work every morning, but he will actually get home before us. It’s crazy.'

The full-time mother says she will have to set off at 6.40am for the 6.50am bus to be 
able to get Olivia to school for 8.40am - meaning in total she will 
spend almost eight hours a day on buses.

'We are having to rely on three buses,' she said.

'Those buses run at 
half-hourly intervals so if one of those buses doesn’t turn up we are 
going to be late.

'I
 feel so sorry for Olivia having to make that journey. I took her on the
 bus for a couple of taster sessions and she was so tired at the end of 
it'

'The schools are now talking about fining for lateness so that is another worry. I am so stressed about it.'

Because
 the crow flying distance is relatively low the family do not even 
qualify for any help with bus fares - it will cost them £35 a week.

'James is looking into passing his test and if he did he would 
have the possibility of a work’s van, but he still wouldn’t be able to 
take us because he sets off at different times to us,' said Miss Stowe.

Miss Stowe said she will have to wake at about 5.30am to get ready and feed Daisy 
before waking up Olivia at 6am to get ready for school, and would not get home until after 5pm each evening.

She
 said: 'When I went for the appeal I took Daisy with me for them to see 
how difficult it would be for me but they did not seem to consider it 
would be a problem.

'There 
was even a suggestion for me to walk across a canal towpath but that 
journey would be no good with children in tow and in dark, damp mornings
 and evenings.'

There are 
other schools that are closer to Miss Stowe but, because they are also 
oversubscribed she has been placed on their waiting lists, and because 
she is further away from those, she is further down the lists.

Allerton Bywater is also a popular school but it has recently expanded, making places available.

Miss Stowe claims she did not receive an admissions form when they were sent out at
 the end of last year and wonders whether this could be why she didn’t 
get a place at her preferred school.

She says she phoned Leeds City Council’s Admissions department in November when she had not received her forms.

'I rang the department and was told to wait and see if the forms 
came because there had been changes with the postal service and it was 
Christmas. I was told to call back in January,' she said.

'I rang back in January as the deadline for applications was nearing and was told I would be sent a form.

'I
 still didn’t receive a form and made several calls between then and 
April to ask for forms. They said they could not understand why I was 
not receiving them and kept sending me forms out.

'I finally received forms in April, on the same day that parents got their letters confirming school places.

'I
 feel so sorry for Olivia having to make that journey. I took her on the
 bus for a couple of taster sessions and she was so tired at the end of 
it.

'And poor little Daisy will be spending even more time on the bus. We are going to have no life.'

Miss Stowe is the latest among a string of parents who have failed to be allocated slots in their nearest or chosen schools for the new school year starting this September.

While education bosses insist every child in Leeds does have an allocated school place, they admit they are 'acutely aware of the pressure' on spaces.

Paul Brennan, Leeds City Council’s deputy director of children’s services, said: 'We are aware that a number of parents in Methley have expressed concerns about securing places at local schools and we are working hard to address this.

'This year has seen us managing an unusually high demand for places in the area which we anticipate will fall next year.

'We will continue to talk to local schools about possible expansion and will do all we can to support parents to get places in a good school as close as possible to their home.

'National legislation, which limits early years class sizes to no more than 30 pupils, also means that school place appeals can only be granted under exceptional circumstances.'

He stressed the importance of parents completing their applications on time as this is 'vital' in helping secure places at preferred schools.

Miss Stowe also expressed concern that a major new 180-house development planned for Methley will add additional strain to school places in the area.

However, the council said no decision has yet been made regarding planning permission for the new scheme and discussions are ongoing with the developers to ensure full community contributions from the developer regarding education provision are secured.

Leeds faces a potential shortfall of more than 4,000 primary school places within three years.
