Lewis Hamilton pipped title rival and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg by just seven thousandths of a second after a nail-biting qualifying session for the Singapore Grand Prix.

For once this season there were drivers other than the Mercedes duo in the hunt for top spot on the grid under the lights of the Marina Bay Street Circuit.

Yet come the conclusion it was Mercedes - and Hamilton in particular - who again just had the edge, with the Briton claiming back-to-back poles after starting out front in the last race in Italy.

Thank you for your company today. Be sure to join us for what promises to be a spectacular race, and in the meantime read our developing report from qualifying.

A brilliant radio exchange ensued Hamilton's pole lap.

Rosberg's engineer: "Hamilton has beaten you by seven thousandths of a second"

Rosberg: "Damn it!"

And another stellar effort from Ricciardo to be just a tenth shy of the Mercedes drivers.

Singapore Grand Prix Grid 1 Hamilton; 2 Rosberg; 3 Ricciardo; 4 Vettel; 5 Alonso; 6 Massa; 7 Raikkonen; 8 Bottas; 9 Magnussen; 10 Kvyat

Wow. What a session. Rosberg sticks it on provisional pole but Hamilton, despite locking up in the first corner, comes through... only seven thousandths of a second quicker.

Ricciardo is the first man to launch his assault on pole. What can the Aussie do? He is really giving it his all, and as he comes over the line, yes, that's provisional pole for the Red Bull man. What can the rest of the field do?

'I have no power.' reports Raikkonen and he is told he will have to stop on track. What a shame. He was a real contender for pole here.

'If we have got any more front wing put it in', says Hamilton. Probably an understatement to say this isn't the best of starts for the Mercedes rivals. They'll all have one more shot at pole.

Anyway back on track and Massa is the first driver to complete a timed lap. It is a 1:46.007. What can Ricciardo do? He is six thousandths of a second down on the Williams. Rosberg comes through and he is only seventh with Hamilton off the pace, too. He is sixth.

Wow. It looks as though we have got a big upset on our hands.

Romain Grosjean meanwhile was furious on his team radio at the end of Q2. He will start only 16th. 'I cannot believe it! Bloody engine! Bloody engine!'

It looks as though the Frenchman wasn't overly pleased with the performance of his Renault V6.

The 12-minute session is underway in Singapore as we determine the top 10 for tomorrow's Singapore Grand Prix.

Mercedes will start as favourites, but Ferrari and Red Bull could mount a real challenge.

Watch this space...

Button will start only 11th tomorrow while Magnussen seals his spot in Q3. The rookie is 8-6 up on his world championship-winning team-mate this season.

Rosberg, on the supersoft compound, heads to the top of the timesheets by almost half-a-second.

So, the top four of Hamilton, Alonso, Raikkonen and Ricciardo are staying in the pits, but Rosberg has gone out, meaning the championship leader will use one more set of tyres than his rivals.

Hulkenberg, Massa, Bottas, Perez, Gutierrez and Grosjean occupy the bottom six with four minutes remaining. We're revving up for the final runs here.

The top 12 are separated by just 1.2 seconds. Indeed the top five of Hamilton, Alonso, Raikkonen, Ricciardo and Rosberg are separated by just two tenths. We have got a realy qualifying session on our hands here.

Hamilton then goes fastest, but only by a whisker. This is really cementing Ferrari's status as challengers for pole today. Rosberg meanwhile, fails to go faster than either Alonso or Raikkonen. Indeed he's 5th with Ricciardo in P4.

And Raikkonen starts where he left off. The Finn heads to the top of the timesheets, but his lap is bettered by team-mate Alonso, but only by three thousandths of a second.

We're back underway at the Marina Bay Circuit - this session will determine who makes it through to the top-10 shootout.

That's the first time Raikkonen has been quickest in any session so far this season.

It's also the third different session where they've topped the timesheets this weekend; they've only been quickest in four sessions the entire season.

So, an interesting Q1, there. No great upsets in regards to the bottom six, but two Ferraris at the top of the timesheets? And Raikkonen quicker than Alonso? It's fair to say, none of us would have predicted that.

And here is Vettel gesticulating at Kvyat earlier in the session...

They've looked strong all weekend and Raikkonen and Alonso now head a 1-2 in Singapore.

Hamilton, in his Mercedes, tries to respond, but he is almost three tenths shy of Raikkonen's best lap.

But as I write that, Button goes second fastest and Vettel pops his Red Bull into P6. The world champions are safe, but Felipe Massa, who has struggled this weekend, is in trouble in 16th.

Nico Hulkenberg posts a 1:47.370 to move to the top of the lap charts with some three minutes remaining.

Jenson Button on the bubble here. He is 17th... and Vettel is still yet to post a time.

Vettel in a spot of bother here. The four-times world champion is yet to set a time with only five minutes remaining.

He then waves his hand at Daniil Kvyat after the Russian, despite being on a slower lap, refused to move off the racing line.

The German will have to go again.

So, Rosberg has popped in a timed lap but he is only sixth, the best part of a second down on Hamilton.

He heads to the pits and takes on a set of supersoft tyres.

Hamilton then heads to the top of the timesheets, three tenths quicker than Alonso.

A big lock-up for Romain Grosjean in the Lotus and he is reporting a major problem with his brakes. It never rains, but it pours for those at the Enstone-based team this year.

But Bottas is quickly usurped by that man Alonso. He's been on fire this weekend hasn't he? His last dry pole was four years ago, here, in Singapore. Could he repeat that feat again today?

Valtteri Bottas is leading the way with seven minutes of Q1 gone - only nine drivers are yet to have posted times so far.

An early mistake from Rosberg who goes in too deep on the run down to Turn 8. Instead of flat-spotting his tyres, as in Monza, he goes straight on, and then has to reach for reverse.

He'll have plenty of time to recover, but hardly an ideal start for the world championship leader.

A lot like the incident during qualifying in Monaco that one.

The pit-lane is open and we are underway in Singapore. Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton are already on track and the latter is told to remember that he has new brakes for the opening session.

Gordon Ramsay, the potty-mouthed chef, is in the McLaren garage today.  I wonder if Jenson Button will be able to cook up a storm today?

Apologies.

The drivers are in their cars and we are only moments away from Q1 - the 18-minute opening session which will see the six slowest cars eliminated.

1. N Rosberg (Mercedes) 2382. L Hamilton (Mercedes) 2163. D Ricciardo (Red Bull)1664. V Bottas (Williams) 1225. F Alonso (Ferrari) 1216. S Vettel (Red Bull) 1067. J Button (McLaren) 728. N Hulkenberg (Force India) 70

Social media was awash with claims Mercedes had fixed the Italian Grand Prix in wake of the collision between Hamilton and Rosberg in Spa.

The theory went that the German, under orders from his team, deliberately went straight on at Turn One in order to gift the win to his team-mate.

It was a claim subsequently denied by Mercedes and much of the paddock.

And you can read Rosberg’s version of events in his MailOnline column.

Fernando Alonso was the surprise pacesetter in the final practice session ahead of qualifying. 

The Ferrari man was marginally quicker than Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo with the Mercedes pair of Rosberg 3rd and Hamilton only 6th.

Could we be in for an upset today? I'm sure many of you would be delighted to see Alonso claim pole for Ferrari... but something tells me Mercedes will have the pace when they need it.

But while the race for this year’s championship continues to intensify, much of the paddock talk so far this weekend has centred around the new radio rules… and the subsequent U-turn.

Struggling to get your head around it? You're not the only one. You can read the very latest on what is allowed, and what isn’t, right here.

My thoughts are that it will be very hard to police; the FIA have just eight men watching transmissions from 22 drivers and their respective engineers.

I dare say it could lead to a controversy of sorts, but what would Formula One be without some of that?

Lewis Hamilton is the man in form after his win last time out in Monza. The Briton forced title rival Nico Rosberg into a mistake at Turn One to claim his first victory since July’s British Grand Prix.

The victory took Hamilton to within 22 points of Rosberg ahead of this weekend’s race under the lights.

The Singapore Grand Prix has been an instant hit on the calendar since its debut in 2008… and surely we’re in for a corker this time round, too.
