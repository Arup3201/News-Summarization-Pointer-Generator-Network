The mother of an Alabama girl testified through tears on Monday that the child's grandmother doesn't deserve to live after being convicted of running her nine-year-old granddaughter to death.

Heather Walker took the stand in support of prosecutors who want the death penalty for her former mother-in-law, Joyce Hardin Garrard.

Walker said the 49-year-old Garrard 'shouldn't be spared' after being convicted of capital murder in the death of Savannah Hardin.

Joyce Hardin Garrard was found guilty of capital murder on Friday. After  more than three hours of deliberation an Etowah County jury found Garrard guilty of murder in the death of nine-year-old granddaughter, Savannah Hardin

'I personally feel like I see no remorse and she took away my baby's life,' Walker said of Garrard.

Seated just a few feet away at the defense table, Garrard showed no emotion. 

Meanwhile, much of Walker's testimony was hard to understand because she was sobbing uncontrollably.

Walker, who is divorced from Garrard's son Robert and has since remarried, said she wasn't allowed to see Savannah during the last two years of the girl's life.

She had sent multiple care packages that were returned to her, and when she would phone the numbers, eventually all the contact numbers she had had been changed.

But then one day a number she didn't recognize phoned her, she told the court on Monday, and it was Robert calling to say Savannah had suffered brain swelling following a seizure 

'How soon can you get here?', he asked.

At that point in her testimony Ms Walker burst into tears, detailing how she tried frantically to get more information.

When she finally tracked her daughter down at Children's Hospital a person on the line said she needed 'the grandmother's permission' to give Heather any information. 

Joyce tried to keep Heather from being alone with Savannah when she did get there. 

Monday on the stand Heather sobbed as described her daughter, who looked normal other than some blood on her face, but was nonetheless hooked up to machines with a fatal injury.

Savannah never had ADHD to her memory and had no injuries or other medical issues. 

''I couldn't understand how that could just happen,' she said she thought.

Heather had not seen daughter Savannah in the year before her death, as she moved out of state to live with her father and stepmother. Jessica says she repeatedly sent things, which would be returned to sender to her

Jurors convicted Garrard on Friday and now must decide whether to recommend death or life without parole, the only options under Alabama law. 

The final decision is up to the judge.

Garrard showed no reaction when the guilty verdict was read, but she hugged her three attorneys before being led out of court by deputies. She glared toward the audience as she walked out silently.

Some of her relatives sitting behind her began to cry.

Defense attorney Dani Bone laid his head on the table in front of him after the verdict, delivered after about three-and-a-half hours of deliberation. Garrard's husband, Johnny, sat behind her, hugging a crying daughter before the daughter ran from the courtroom sobbing.

The defense will begin presenting its case for a life sentence on Wednesday.

Prosecutors said Garrard — with eight surviving grandchildren and a ninth-grade education — should be put to death for making the child run around her yard and carry wood for hours as punishment for a lie about candy in February 2012.

Prosecutors contended that Garrard refused to let Savannah stop running even after the girl was vomiting and begging for an end to the exercise. In court, they cited a school bus surveillance video that captured Garrard saying she would run the girl and teach her a lesson.

Defense attorney Richard Rhea had portrayed his client as a devoted grandmother who was helping to look after 9-year-old Savannah while the girl's father was overseas working as a contractor for the U.S. State Department.

Under cross-examination by defense attorney Richard Rhea, Walker said she didn't believe Garrard 'woke up that morning' planning to kill Savannah. Rather, she said, the situation seemed to get out of hand.

'I think there was a point where she knew what she was doing,' Walker said. Another witness, Samuel Hudgins, testified he saw the girl running laps around the house that day as Garrard stood by.

Some witnesses who testified about seeing Garrard force Savannah to run seemed more upset in recalling the scene from the stand than Garrard appeared to be, Griffith said.

But Rhea urged jurors to ask why none of the witnesses intervened if they thought the abuse was so awful that day.

He said, 'I think we have all had the thought: 'If it was that bad, why didn't they do something?'' He said witnesses didn't notify police about their concerns until days later, after they heard girl was on life support.

'Then it becomes 'Oh yeah, I witnessed boot camp. I witnessed the drill sergeant from hell',' he said.

Garrard was the final witness to testify on Wednesday and attorneys for both sides concluded their closing arguments Friday afternoon.

Savannah collapsed from a seizure and died three days later in a hospital in Birmingham after doctors determined there was no brain activity and removed her from life support. An autopsy blamed her death on seizures cause by low sodium following extreme physical exertion.

Walker described the mournful scene in the hospital room as a physician turned off a breathing machine as a test to see whether Savannah, who was unconscious, would breathe on her own.

'During this time Joyce was just screaming at Savannah saying, 'Savannah, you need to breathe,'' Walker said.

Within moments it was obvious Savannah wouldn't survive, she said.

'I held her hand until her body stiffened up,' said Walker, sobbing and barely understandable.

But Garrard seemed more worried about herself than her granddaughter, Walker said.

Later at the hospital, Walker said, Garrard grabbed the shoulders of the child's pregnant stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin.

Even though Hardin was in labor at the time and would later give birth, Garrard seemed intent on getting the other woman's attention, Walker said.

'She said, 'Jessica, there's a lot on the line. You need to pull it together,'' Walker said.

Walker said already had suspicions about what had happened to her daughter, and she became 'more uneasy' after hearing Garrard's remarks to Hardin.

Harden has also been charged with her murder, for allegedly sitting by as Garrard ran the girl to death, which carries a life sentence

Garrard and Hardin were both at the house the afternoon the girl ran, evidence showed.

Garrard has been in jail awaiting trial for three years, and that time typically would be applied to any potential sentence.

Hardin has also been charged with her murder, for allegedly sitting by as Garrard ran the girl to death, which carries a life sentence.

The girl was in the care of her stepmother and grandmother while her father was away. Hardin, who is awaiting trial, gave birth the day after her arrest in 2012.  

Savannah loved cheer leading and horses and wanted to be a veterinarian when she grew up, Walker said.

'She was full of life. She was the sweetest little girl,' said Walker.
