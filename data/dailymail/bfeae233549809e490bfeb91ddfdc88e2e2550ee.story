An astronaut currently orbiting 220 miles above the earth didn’t let a lack of gravity stop her from attending her high school reunion over the weekend.

Karen Nyberg is an American aboard the International Space Station. She’s been there since May.

So when the Henning High School class of 1988 reunion met this past weekend, Nyberg enlisted the help of NASA and attended the gathering via video link from outer space.

Flying high: Dr. Karen Nyberg, seen here aboard the space shuttle Discovery, is now aboard the International Space Station. But she didn't let that stop her from attending her high school reunion

‘Hello Karen,’ said classmate Andrea Rogers, as a smiling blond woman hovered on a screen before her. ‘Welcome to your 25th high school class reunion!’

From the space station to Henning, Minnesota, Nyberg, 43, said hello back and proceeded to become the most jealousy-inducing, ego-shrinking high school reunion attendee of all time.

If there were doctors, lawyers, or self-made millionaires in attendance, even they must have shriveled as their classmate-turned-astronaut spun 360 degrees in zero gravity.

‘This is my favorite part of the job,’ she smiled, while upside down.

Overachiever: Nyberg graduated from Henning High School in Henning, Minnesota in 1988 and her career has been skyrocketing ever since

What have you been up to? Via video link, Dr. Nyberg was able to visit her 25th high school reunion in Henning, Minnesota from 220 miles above the earth

Showing off: Nyberg was able to give her old classmates a tour of the International Space Station and even turned the camera back on themselves, showing them Earth from outer space

For a group of her old high school chums and their kids, Dr. Nyberg gave a tour of the International Space Station as well as a Q&A.

She even gave them a view of themselves, turning the camera towards Earth from about a million feet up.

But the meeting wasn’t one-sided. 

Say hello, honey: Nyberg's classmates brought their kids in for a Q&A with the astronaut

As the group caught up with their high achieving friend, they got to share what they’d been up to as well. Even if it seemed a little underwhelming by comparison.

‘Hi Karen, this is Tracy and my fiance, Jeff,’ said a proud classmate.

‘Tracy and fiancé,’ replied the doctor of mechanical engineering. ‘Congratulations, I guess I didn't know that.’

'This is my favorite part of the job': Nyberg displays her zero gravity skills

‘They kind of become your extended brothers and sisters,’ Rogers said of Nyberg and her other classmates to WDAY. ‘So, for her to be able to join us sort of completes our family reunion as much as it is a class reunion.’

Like a lot of her high school friends, Karen is also married and has a 3-year-old son back on Earth and says she swaps videos with them every day.

Nyberg's mission launched via Soyuz rocket May 28 and is scheduled to last around five more months.
