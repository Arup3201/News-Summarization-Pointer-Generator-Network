Pete Siebold, 43, escaped with just an injured shoulder when the Virgin Galactic spacecraft broke apart mid-flight and crashed in the Mojave desert

Investigators  are trying to piece together how SpaceShipTwo's surviving pilot  managed to escape the rocket as it disintegrated around him and parachute to the ground from an altitude virtually devoid of oxygen.

Pete Siebold, 43, sustained just an injured shoulder when the Virgin Galactic spacecraft broke apart mid-flight and crashed in the Mojave desert last Friday, killing co-pilot Michael Alsbury, 39.

Christopher Hart, acting chairman for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) that is leading the crash investigation, said Mr Siebold did not exit through the cockpit's escape hatch.

'We know it wasn't through there, so how did this pilot get out?' he said.

Mr Siebold is being treated in hospital and is yet to speak to investigators. 

It has also been revealed that a 'human-factors' expert will join the investigation  to study why the Mr Alsbury prematurely unlocked a pivoting tail section of the ship during a test flight.

The untimely engagement of the tail mechanism - designed to slow the vehicle's descent into the atmosphere from space - have emerged as a main thrust of the inquiry into the crash.

It raises the prospect of human error as a cause for the crash, though investigators say it is too early to make any firm determination. 

'We know already from having the lever move from lock to unlock that we need to get a human-factors person in here,' said Mr Hart. 

'The question then is why did that happen when it happened?'

Investigators have yet to determine whether releasing the tail mechanism too early caused or contributed to the crash of the space plane near the Mojave Air and Space Port, about 95 miles  north of Los Angeles.

The suborbital rocket vehicle dubbed SpaceShipTwo broke into pieces shortly after it separated from the special jet plane that carries it aloft for its high-altitude launches.

The crash, which unfolded without SpaceShipTwo catching fire or exploding in flames, came on its fourth powered test flight, the first since January.

Video footage from the cockpit shows Mr Alsbury releasing a lever to unlock the twin-tail section eight seconds after SpaceShipTwo's engine ignited.

Two seconds later the tail, which did not have sufficient aerodynamic pressure to hold it in place, began to pivot upward, a maneuver designed to increase drag for atmospheric re-entry. 

SpaceShipTwo, developed by the fledgling space tourism company of billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson, was designed to carry wealthy passengers on short rides into space.

Virgin Galactic was planning to begin offering its first flights to paying customers next spring.

Mr Hart told a news conference  that investigators had determined SpaceShipTwo's tail system was supposed to have been released for deployment as the craft was traveling about 1.4 times the speed of sound.

Instead, the tail section began pivoting when the vehicle was flying at Mach 1, the speed of sound.

'I'm not stating that this is the cause of the mishap. We have months and months of investigation to determine what the cause was,' Mr Hart said.

Asked if pilot error was a possible factor, Mr Hart said: 'We are looking at all of these issues to determine what was the root cause of this mishap ... including that possibility.'

Also unclear was exactly how the tail mechanism began to rotate once it was unlocked, since that maneuver requires a separate pilot command that was never given, Mr Hart said.

This raised questions about whether the craft's position in the air and its speed somehow enabled the tail section to swing free on its own. 

The spacecraft was supposed to 'feather' when it reached its maximum altitude at 360,000ft but the device was launched early just seconds after detaching from the launch craft

The untimely engagement of the tail mechanism - designed to slow the vehicle's descent into the atmosphere from space - and the possibility that pilot error was to blame, have emerged as a main thrust of the inquiry
