A Belgian student travelled more than 5,000 miles to Austin, Texas, to meet a stranger who Facebook suggested he make friends with.

Victor Van Rossem, 24, was curious when Neal D Retke, 49, popped up as a 'suggested friend' on his Facebook feed because they had no obvious connection aside from one mutual acquaintance.

But after browsing through Mr Retke's pictures, Mr Van Rossem, from Ghent in Belgium, became intrigued by the artist's eclectic interests.

Have you seen this man? The poster which Belgian student Victor Van Rossem, 24, placed all over Austin, Texas in an attempt to find Neal D Retke, a stranger whom Facebook suggested he should befriend.

'Facebook suggested we become friends, and I thought that was pretty absurd,' Mr Van Rossem said.

'I became fascinated by him. He had a long beard and looked a little unusual. He did art performances and paintings of mythical creatures and strange beasts which only made me more interested in him.

'He looked like someone I wanted to meet - a very eccentric person.'

So when Mr Retke, of Texas, failed to respond to him on Facebook, Mr Van Rossem decided to make the 5,000-mile trip to ask him in person if they could be friends.

'These days you can be friends with anyone anywhere just by clicking that friend request button. I wanted to take it back to the real world,' Mr Retke said.

Best of Facebook friends: Mr Van Rossem, Mr Van Bree and Mr Retke, who they finally met at a book signing

Mr Van Rossem set off with his friend, Bran Van Bree, 27, who took a video camera to document the adventure.

They spent a week searching for Mr Retke, scouring the city of Austin by putting posters up on every street and asking passers-by if they knew him.

They even wore t-shirts carrying the slogan 'Neal D Retke for President!' in the hope they would help them find him.

Mr Van Rossem, said: 'At first we thought our chances of finding him were very slim, but then we visited some places in Austin that we knew he liked to go - and we eventually found someone who knew him.'

That contact suggested looking for Mr Retke at a book signing. There Mr Van Rossem finally came face-to-face with the stranger to whom Facebook was so keen to introduce him.

'We were nervous when we first saw him,' said Mr Van Rossem

'We didn't know how he would react - but after we explained the whole thing he just laughed and said "well, you found me" as if he was expecting us.'

Fun times: in the end Mr Van Rossem and Mr Van Bree spent three weeks in Austin getting to know Mr Retke

Facebook's algorithms were vindicated as Mr Van Rossem and Mr Van Bree spent three enjoyable weeks with Mr Retke.

Mr Van Rossem said: 'We had a lot of fun with Neal, and I consider him a real friend. We're still in touch through Facebook, and he might be coming to visit us next summer.
