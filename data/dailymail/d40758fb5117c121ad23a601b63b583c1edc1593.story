The youngster promptly decided to join him at his booth for breakfast, with the heartwarming gesture caught on camera.

Making friends: Gracie Lynn Wilson from Evansville, Indiana, spotted Kris Kringle feasting solo at a Bob Evans American diner on Wednesday - she promptly decided to join him at his booth for breakfast

A photograph of the incident shows little Gracie sat opposite a portly, white bearded-man, complete with glasses, red suspenders and a festive-print shirt.

Recalling the incident, Gracie's mother, Lindsey, told WFIE News: '[A] gentleman just walked in look[ing] identical to Santa [with] the glasses, the outfit, the hair.

'Gracie loved this, so when we [got] seated we come to find he’s sat right next to [us]and he’s sitting by himself.

'She pulled up the chair and they just started having a conversation like they knew each other for years.' 

Gracie apparently didn't put in any requests for presents but told Mr Claus she can't wait to meet her baby brother, James, who is due in a few weeks.
