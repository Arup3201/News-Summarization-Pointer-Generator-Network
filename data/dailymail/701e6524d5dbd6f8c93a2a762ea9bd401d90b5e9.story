A former hotel receptionist has been ordered to sell her Footballers' Wives-style mansion after police discovered it was built using her gangster ex-boyfriend's drug money.

Neighbours had assumed Daniella Green, 36, and David Statham were Lottery winners when the six-bedroom stone detached villa was erected in Littleborough, Greater Manchester in 2003.

In fact, Statham had just got out of jail after being convicted for masterminding a £7.5million cannabis ring.

Luxury: The house in Littleborough, Greater Manchester, has six bedrooms, four bathrooms and swimming pool and an under-floor heating system

Guilty: Daniella Green, 36, has been ordered to sell the mansion built by her drug dealer ex-boyfriend David Statham, right, who died in 2006

A judge has now ordered Green to sell the luxury property - once valued at £1.2m but now believed to worth around £600,000 - to pay back £535,000.

Green took control of the mansion in 2006, after Statham - whose gangland nickname was 'The Beak' - died in a quad biking accident aged 44.

The villa - given the title Marlborough House - has four bathrooms, three reception rooms, a swimming pool, a canopy, balcony and a £21,000 underfloor heating system.

Dead: David Statham was convicted for conspiracy to supply drugs and jailed for nine years in 2001. He died in a quad biking accident after being released in 2006

Green met Statham when she was just 17 while working in a hotel in Rochdale which he used as one of three bases to run a huge drugs operation.

He ran a crime racket which smuggled 250kg cannabis shipments in lorries from Spain into the UK over a year long period.

Police investigating him said he used 40 different payphones in Rochdale and Stockport in a bid to 
give them the slip giving orders on imminent deals to a 
team of couriers, drivers and distributors.

Statham spent his drug money on trips so the casinos - sometimes spending up to £60,000 a time using 
an alias and in one month alone bought chips totalling £250,000, losing
 £100,000 at the gambling tables.

In 2001 he was finally caught and jailed for nine years for 
conspiracy to supply drugs.

Green stood by her man after his 
conviction and shortly before his release she legitimately bought the plot
 of land for £55,000 in the Pennines hills where Stratham then built the house.

Manchester Crown Court was told how a 
neighbour recalled Statham as being a 'nasty man.'

During his trial in 2001 a Proceeds of Crime Act heard how he went on the run in France after fleeing police by 
jumping through a back window of his former home in Bury.

The father of two was at large for nine months before being tracked down to the Cote d'Azur and extradited back to Britain.

He and Green later split up
 after she accused of him of being controlling and moved into her 
mother's home.

But after she died she discovered she was still on the deeds to the house and took sole control.

A former receptionist, Green met Stratham when she was just 17 and he used her hotel as a base for his drug-smuggling empire

Police uncovered the asset after Green was arrested in connection with the criminal activities of her new partner Scott Baker.

Officers raided a safety deposit box she had set up in Manchester and found £117,000 in cash.

Police popped the locks on a vault owned 
by Baker and Green at St James Safe Deposit Co, at Oxford Street in March 2010.

They examined her finances and established she could not have financed the property on her wage.

Detectives suspected all the cash 
belonged to Statham but days before Green and Baker were due to go on trial for money laundering, Baker admitted
 he had stolen £47,000 of it from his family hotel business.

The remaining £70,000 was found to have come legitimately from the hotel where he worked as a director.

At a Proceeds of Crime Hearing, Miss Suzanne Goddard QC, prosecuting said Green was
 registered with the local authority to pay council tax and after 
Statham's death she treated the property as her own - although there was
 no evidence she lived there.

She said: 'Green's finances were such that she 
could not finance the house as she was of limited means.

'She
 made a statement to police that she was being harassed by David 
Statham. She stated he was a well known criminal and acknowledged that 
he had been involved in drug running and car crime.

'Upon
 his release the relationship deteriorated and in December 2004 she 
moved to her mother's yet suffered repeated harassment and made a 
complaint to police.

'On 
27th April 2006 she contacted police to say that she no longer wished to
 continue with the complaint. He died two months later. She continued to
 treat the house as her own and paid the council tax.'

In mitigation defence counsel 
Chris Daw said Statham was a 'vicious, violent psychopathic individual' 
who had taken control of Green's life when she was just 17.

He denied Green had lived an 'extravagant lifestyle' on his crimes and said Statham had made her life a 'misery'.

At Manchester Crown Court, Green of 
Chadderton, Oldham, pleaded guilty to being concerned in an arrangement 
which she knew facilitated the retention of criminal property.

She was given six months jail suspended for two years.

She
 was also ordered to sell the mansion to pay 
back £535,000 under the Proceeds of Crime Act or face seven years jail. 
The house is currently worth £600,000.

Today Det Con John Conroy of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Not only did Daniella Green have full knowledge of Statham's criminality, and not only did it provide her with a lavish lifestyle, she acquired this property knowing that it represented criminal property and indeed took it after his death.

'It is undeniably in the public interest for us to investigate people like Daniella Green as without them organised crime would not be able to flourish.

'This house may be made up of bricks and mortar, but it was built on the foundations of criminality; I hope it reassures the public that it will now need to be sold, and the money raised will be reinvested into our communities.'

Baker, 39, a director of the Saddleworth Hotel in Delph, near Oldham pleaded guilty to theft and was sentenced to nine months imprisonment, suspended for two years.
