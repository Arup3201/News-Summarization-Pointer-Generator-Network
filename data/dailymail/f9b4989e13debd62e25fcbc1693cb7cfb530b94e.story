The Victoria's Secret girls are always ready for their close-ups.

And now South African model Candice Swanepoel has been chosen to front the brand's 'CloseUp' bra, the latest in push-up technology from the lingerie giant.

Featuring wider sidebands to ensure maximum uplift the underwear boasts 'extreme lift, serious smoothing and maximum impact' on the retailer's website.

And who better to put it to the test than the VS favourite, who has just been confirmed as one of this season's high-ranking angels.

Are you ready for your close-up? Candice is as she models the latest Victoria's Secret bra

The 24-year-old will no doubt boost sales as the star of a short film promoting the $48 push-up.

Twirling
around an imposing location house in the 'Flawless Pink' version of the
set, which includes the $12.50 No-Show Sexy Hiphugger Panty, Candice 
asks viewers: 'Are you ready for your close-up?'

She
certainly is. And she shows it with a bit more twirling, lots of 
running her hands across her tiny waist, and lots of gazing in to the 
camera as a gentle breeze lifts her artfully dishevelled hair.

Victoria's Secret explain that: 'Extreme lift creates enhanced cleavage with wider, double-lined 
sides for ultimate smoothing and your sleekest shape yet. With a deep 
plunging neckline, this bra is sexy and comfy, so you never have to 
choose between the two.'

And the bra seems to work hard, giving Candice a cleavage most women would happily pay $48 for.

Reviewers on the retailer's website though are torn, with the bra receiving an average score of 3.2 out of 5 and several customers criticising the bra's straps as being wide and uncomfortable.
