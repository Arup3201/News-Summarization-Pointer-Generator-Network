A man who faked his own death in an £850,000 life insurance scam is attempting to dodge deportation by claiming his ‘right to a family life’ – despite the fact he has split from his wife.

The 59-year-old fraudster, who can only be identified by the initials ‘HJS’, was sentenced to five years in prison after being found guilty of faking his own death to start a new life in abroad.

The father-of-four - who is originally from Ecuador but was living in Farnham, Surrey, at the time of the offence – was jailed after being convicted of fraud totalling £850,000 at Oxford Crown Court in 2012.

The man is claiming he should not be deported to his home country of Ecuador because he has a 'right to a private and family life' under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights

The court heard how he took out a £500,000 life insurance policy, several personal loans and ran up large debts on seven different credit cards before his wife – ‘SL’ – told his employers he had suffered a fatal heart attack while on holiday.

His life insurance policy paid out and all his debts were wiped after she handed officials his death certificate – but the pair were caught out when investigators found his fingerprints on the document.

‘HJS’ was then extradited from Australia - where he had fled to start a new life under an assumed identity – and jailed. His wife was also jailed for two years for her involvement in the elaborate plot.

However, after being convicted, ‘HJS’ was put up for ‘automatic deportation’ by Home Secretary Theresa May who said he should be removed from Britain under rules which state that any foreign criminal jailed for more than 12 months should be deported.

He appealed the decision, arguing that being deported was a violation of his right to private and family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

He also said he would face ill-treatment in his home country and claimed asylum under Article 3 of the Act, which protects against torture, inhuman or degrading treatment.

His case was initially rejected by immigration judges but he appealed again and the Upper Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber said the decision on Article 8 was ‘fatally flawed’.

The case is now due to be heard again, meaning he could potentially be allowed to remain in Britain indefinitely if officials rule his human rights have been violated.

He continues to fight for the right to a private and family life, despite reportedly having abandoned his family following his conviction.

Conservative MP Dominic Raab, who is campaigning for human rights laws to be reformed, described the situation as ‘crazy’.

He told The Daily Telegraph: ‘It's crazy that, yet again, the immigration tribunal is allowing a convicted fraudster who abandoned his family to claim a right to family life to trump the public interest in seeing him removed from Britain.

‘Worse still, the tribunal is airbrushing details of the individual, eroding the principle of open justice, which is vital to retaining public confidence.’

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We remain at appeal and will be advised by the tribunal about a new hearing date in due course.’
