Filmmaker Michael Moore has sparked controversy after calling for photographs of the slain children of Sandy Hook to be made public.

The Bowling for Columbine director took to his blog on Wednesday to argue that gory photographs of the crime scene and the bodies of Adam Lanza's 26 shooting victims should be released to force Americans to act on gun control.

Under an item entitled 'America, You Must Not Look Away (How to Finish Off the NRA)' outspoken Moore says that similar horrific images forced changes in public opinion on issues like civil rights and Vietnam.

Controversy: Michael Moore has called for pictures of the scenes at Sandy Hook - including images of the bodies of the child victims - to be released. The filmmaker says they would make America act on gun control

Opposition: Many criticized Moore's stance today saying it would be an 'offense' to victims and their families to do such a thing

He said a similar route should be taken on gun control.

'I believe someone in Newtown, Connecticut – a grieving parent, an upset law enforcement officer, a citizen who has seen enough of this carnage in our country – somebody, someday soon, is going to leak the crime scene photos of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre,' he writes.

'And when the American people see what bullets from an assault rifle fired at close range do to a little child's body, that's the day the jig will be up for the NRA.'

'It will be the day the debate on gun control will come to an end. There will be nothing left to argue over. It will just be over. And every sane American will demand action.'

Denial: The documentary maker says America is in denial about the need to act and such images would give them the jolt they need to do something and 'end the NRA'

He adds that he expects there will be an outcry from many that publishing the images is 'sick' and a 'disgrace'.

But he goes on: 'This will be a false outrage. Because the real truth is this: We do not want to be confronted with what the actual results of a violent society looks like.'

'Because if we were to seriously look at the 20 slaughtered children – I mean really look at them, with their bodies blown apart, many of them so unrecognizable the only way their parents could identify them was by the clothes they were wearing – what would be our excuse not to act? Now. Right now. This very instant!'

However among those who were opposed to such a stance were families of the victims who spoke to Fox News yesterday. 

Jeremy Richman, whose 6-year-old daughter Avielle, was killed in the attack said: 'I would be very strongly against that.'

Trying to recover: Children from Sandy Hook Elementary are pictured here returning to school. A victim support worker said Moore's suggestion would ruin the memories of the young victims

Another mother told the broadcaster: 'You can imagine what my reaction to that is'.

Co-president of the Newtown Parent Connection, Dorrie Carolan, added: 'It’s going to be a long healing process and to dredge up pictures of the crime scene would not be a good thing.

'We want to remember the little angels as they were, with their happy expressions and faces and you want to think of the teachers trying to hold them safe and not to see the pictures of their bodies.

'For the families and the community, we just want to get back to a normal life and that would be a horrendous offense to the families. There’s no need for any of that.'

However, Moore says one mother may understand where he is coming from.

Veronique Pozner, mother of 6-year-old victim Noah, took Connecticut Governor Daniel Malloy by the hand to see her young son's open-casket.

Remembrance: Many victims families want to remember them as they lived rather than as they died

She later said his death had to be seen. 

'I owed it to him as his mother — the good, the bad, the ugly,' Pozner told the Stamford Advocate.

'It is not up to me to say I am only going to look at you and deal with you when you are alive, that I am going to block out the reality of what you look like when you are dead.'

'And as a little boy, you have to go in the ground. If I am going to shut my eyes to that I am not his mother. I had to bear it. I had to do it.'

Moore signs off with a warning to the NRA that if Sandy Hook photos aren't released, another victim's family could release gun crime photos in the future and that would spell their end.

'While you're looking at the heinous photographs, try saying those words out loud: 'I support the Second Amendment!' Something, I'm guessing, won't feel right,' he writes

'Yes, someday a Sandy Hook mother – or a Columbine mother, or an Aurora mother, or a mother from massacres yet to come – will say, like the mother of Emmett Till, "I just want the world to see." And then nothing about guns in this country will ever be the same again.'
