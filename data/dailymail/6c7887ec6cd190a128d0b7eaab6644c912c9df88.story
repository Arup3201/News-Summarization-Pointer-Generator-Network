Jonny Wilkinson has dismissed speculation that he is poised to take up a role with England ahead of this year’s World Cup.

Reports in France suggested the World Cup winner was destined to act as a kicking consultant to Stuart Lancaster’s squad, but despite admitting his ambition to work with England at some stage, the 35-year-old icon said there are no imminent plans.

‘I’d love to do that but I’m not coaching there,’ Wilkinson said. ‘I’m not involved in any way. I coach with Toulon and it’s unfortunately something that’s been mis-reported, I think.’

TIGERS' MANU BLOW 

Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill has conceded that Manu Tuilagi is unlikely to recover from a groin injury before the end of the season. The centre had originally been expected to return before Christmas.

‘Manu is improving but it is a long process,’ said Cockerill. ‘The likelihood is he will be fit for June and he’ll join England for their World Cup camp.’

Saracens centre Brad Barritt is still recovering from a knee injury and is unlikely to face Racing Metro 

England centre Brad Barritt is unlikely to be rushed back from a knee injury for Saracens’ Champions Cup quarter-final against Racing Metro on Sunday.

Barritt is sidelined along with team-mate Owen Farrell, who is not expected to return until the end of next month.

‘Owen has no chance for next weekend,’ said director of rugby Mark McCall. ‘Brad has got a small chance but we won’t take a gamble on him.’ 

Saracens and England fly half Owen Farrell is expected to make his return to action at the end of April
