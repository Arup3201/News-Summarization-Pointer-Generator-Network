Australia has pressed the Thai government to allow a transition period before it bans commercial surrogacy in a bid to allow Australians to receive children being carried by Thai surrogate mothers.

The request made by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop comes a day after a Thai surrogacy agency was shut down by authorities.

Ms Bishop made the call to acting Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow at the ASEAN Foreign Ministers meeting in Myanmar capital Naypitdaw, yesterday.

Ms Bishop raised the issue of ongoing cases of surrogate mothers for Australian women and requested Thai authorities allow for a 'transition period' for the births 'for humanitarian reasons' before enforcing proposed laws.

The Australian families have already paid thousands of dollars to agents and the surrogate mothers for the procedure.

Mr Sihasak told reporters Ms Bishop said the Australian government had no policy to support commercial surrogacy and Thailand had full authority to deal with issue.

Ms Bishop's request comes as Thailand prepares to fast track legislation through the National Legislative Assembly.

An estimated 70 per cent of Australian couples seeking surrogacy attended the All IVF clinic

As many as 50 Australian couples may have lost the opportunity to be parents after the Bangkok IVF clinic was shut down with Thai authorities suspecting links to an international baby trafficking organisation.

Following the closure of the All IVF Center on Friday, there are grave concerns that Thai surrogate mothers could abort their babies now they have no support from the clinic as the baby Gammy scandal has seen 40 clinics raided in a serious crackdown across Thailand.

It is estimated that about 50 Australian couples, who have arrangements with the clinic, have no way of contacting their surrogates and the whereabouts of the embryos previously stored at clinic was also unknown, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Thai authorities has cracked down on the growing surrogacy business after the plight of Gammy, a six-month old baby with Down syndrome, whose Australian biological parents allegedly left him behind in Thailand but took his twin sister to Bunbury in Western Australia.

Surrogacy Australia founder Sam Everingham has called on the Thai authorities to ensure all of the clinic’s surrogates are safe and the biological parents will be reunited with their babies when born.

The Thailand Health Service Support department has connected the clinic to the alleged biological father of six boys and three girls aged between six and 12 months, who were found in a Bangkok apartment and were taken into the state’s care.

Authorities allege 24-year-old Japanese businessman Mitsuoki Shigeta, who has visited Thailand 65 times since 2012, has taken at least three other babies out of Thailand, two of them to Cambodia.

Mr Shigeta, who flew out of Thailand early on Friday morning, is wanted for questioning over human trafficking, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Health Service Support chief Boonruang Trairuangworawat said the clinic was shut down because services could cause harm or even deaths: ‘it’s registered as a medical facility but not as one offering fertility treatments’.

Pisit Tantiwattanakul, the clinic’s executive director, infertility specialist and chief embryologist, was described on the clinic’s website before it was shut down on Sunday, as ‘charming and kind,’ who received ‘high marks for his patient demeanour and his direct approach to client care’ and performed more than 700 IVF procedures a year.

It is estimated that up to 70 per cent of Australian couples seeking surrogacy attended Dr Tantiwattanakul’s clinic.

Australia has set up a multi-agency committee to pressure Thai authorities to allow Australians with existing agreements to be fulfilled so surrogacy babies can be taken back to Australia as planned.

Thai medical officials are treating surrogacy as human trafficking cases until parliament passes legislation banning surrogacy, except where family members were concerned.

David Farnell, who was jailed for child molestation, and his wife Wendy will break their silence on Channel Nine’s 60 Minutes program on Sunday on why they left Gammy in Thailand.

But Pattharamon Janbua, the baby’s Thai surrogate, has said she will reject a Channel Nine donation to an appeal to pay Gammy’s medical costs and long-term care, saying she does not want the Farnells' money or sympathy.
