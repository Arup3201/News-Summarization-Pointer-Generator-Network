A schoolboy tearfully begged doctors to help him hours before he died from meningitis, a conduct hearing has been told.

Ten-year-old William Cressey pleaded with them: ‘Please help me. Why won’t you help me? If you don’t help me, I am going to die. Please help me, I don’t want to die.’

William was prescribed Calpol and sent home from hospital because doctors thought he was suffering from a migraine, his mother said.

Hours later Cheryl Cressey took him 
back to the ward but he suffered a fit and died later that day. Mrs 
Cressey said she repeatedly alerted doctors and nurses to her son’s 
deteriorating condition, but was dismissed as a ‘neurotic mum’.

Christopher Kirby, one of the nurses 
in charge of looking after him, is appearing before the Nursing and 
Midwifery Council in central London.

He admits failing to carry out proper
 observations on William and record keeping errors. But he denies 
walking away when a colleague asked him for help with the boy.

William, from Croft, County Durham, 
was admitted to Darlington Memorial Hospital on February 28, 2005 but by
 9am the following day the decision was made by the doctors to send him 
home.

Mrs Cressey told the hearing: 
‘William’s eyes were seriously protruding and he was having difficulty 
in closing his lids over his eyes.

‘I told a nurse that his eyes were really causing him suffering and she went to senior male nurse Christopher Kirby.’

Mrs Cressey said the nurse explained the situation to Mr Kirby.

Bernice Zair, 89, was allegedly given a mattress on the floor to sleep on at Darlington Memorial Hospital

‘His reply was, “Well you know what 
to do about that don’t you?”, she replied, “no”, and he said, “Just 
don’t touch it”, and then he walked away.’

Breaking down in tears, she added: 
‘William heard this and said: “That was not very kind, was it mum?” 
Tears rolled down his face.’

She said her son lay on the bed 
writhing in agony and vomiting but doctors refused to accept that he had
 meningitis because he did not have a rash.

After being kept in overnight he was 
sent home on March 1 with Calpol and another painkiller, ibuprofen, and a
 cardboard tray to be sick in.

His mother took him back to hospital 
but by then he was beyond help and he suffered the fatal fit. He had 
seen five doctors in three days who were unable to diagnose and treat 
him.

His mother, now in her early 50s, said she repeatedly told doctors 
that she suspected meningitis but each time was ignored.

Derek Zeitlin, for the Nursing and 
Midwifery Council, told the hearing there was no suggestion that Mr 
Kirby’s actions had caused William’s death. The hearing continues.

A girl of five died from meningitis less than 48 hours after she was twice diagnosed with a bug and sent home by doctors, an inquest heard yesterday.

Kelsey Smart, from Kingswood, south Gloucestershire, was initially taken to an out-of-hours emergency GP service after she started vomiting and developed a red rash across her stomach in February last year.

Her mother, Hannah Smart, told the inquest that locum GP Dr Jens Rohrbeck, who saw Kelsey at Frendoc’s clinic at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, said she had picked up a virus and that she did not need to be seen by hospital doctors.

Mrs Smart said that the next morning she took Kelsey to the Orchard Medical Centre in Kingswood, where the schoolgirl saw  Dr Sarah Grant. Mrs Smart said Dr Grant told her Kelsey had a bug and sent her home without any drugs.

Later that day Kelsey had a fit. She was taken to Bristol Children’s Hospital and put on life support but doctors later pronounced her brain dead, Avon Coroner’s Court heard.

Recording a narrative verdict, Avon Coroner Maria Voisin said: ‘Earlier intervention is better but what cannot be said is whether earlier treatment would have resulted in a different outcome for Kelsey.’
