Gable Tostee was 'heavily intoxicated' and 'causing alarm' on the Gold Coast between 2am and 3am in the months before his fateful date with balcony fall victim Warriena Wright, court documents allege.

The documents, filed by prosecutors in Brisbane Supreme Court to oppose the 28-year-old's bid for bail this week, also allege he repeatedly told a police officer to 'f*** off' and called him a 'small man' during an incident on January 27 at a Surfers Paradise convenience store.

The bodybuilder and carpet layer was also charged with high-range drink driving in July this year, the documents filed on Monday claim.

Gable Tostee's criminal history includes four outstanding charges, according to documents filed by both prosecutors and his own defence during his bail application on a murder charge. Tostee was 'heavily intoxicated' and 'causing alarm' on the Gold Coast between 2am and 3am on January 27, prosecutors say in the court documents

His criminal history, which includes four outstanding charges for which he was on bail, are part of a legal brief tendered in the court before Justice Debra Mullins during his bail application on a murder charge.

Gable Tostee is charged with the August 8 murder of New Zealander, Warriena Wright. His lawyer, Michael Purcell, told the court his client will strenuously defend the charge, which Mr Purcell described as inappropriate.

In Mr Tostee's bail application, he admitted to two past offences, namely a forgery charge in 2006 for which no conviction was recorded, a 2011 driving charge, and four outstanding charges from this year which are due to be mentioned in the Southport Magistrates Court on October 10.

Two outstanding charges against Mr Tostee from January 27 relate to an alleged incident which took place after police were flagged down by a tuk-tuk driver who claimed he had run from the vehicle without paying his fare, according to the court documents.

Prosecutors claim, in the court documents, Mr Tostee was standing in a nearby Surfers Paradise convenience store on Ferny Avenue, buying chocolate and 'using obscene language' when Constable Leigh Hurley approached him and was told twice to 'f*** off'.

The court documents state Constable Hurley observed Mr Tostee was 'causing alarm to members of the public attempting to purchase items from the store and that he was interfering with 'peaceable business'.

When the officer arrested Mr Tostee, the defendant allegedly said to him, according to court documents: 'What are you going to do small man, f*** off c***'.

Prosecutors allege, in the court documents, after being placed in the rear of a police vehicle, Mr Tostee then allegedly put his foot in the door to prevent it being closed, said 'f*** off' again, 'violently kicked out at' Sergeant Stephen Wright, who sprayed Tostee with capsicum spray which 'had no effect'.

He was charged with one count each of commit public nuisance and assault or obstruct a police officer, according to the court documents.

Warriena Wright, pictured with her mother Beth (left) and younger sister Reza (centre), is alleged in the court documents to have met Gable Tostee on a Tinder date on August 7 in Surfers Paradise. The court documents claim she died after falling from the balcony of the apartment rented by Mr Tostee, who has made an application for bail on a charge of murdering her

The court documents filed during Mr Tostee's bail application on Monday say he was charged on July 27 with driving under the influence of liquor and breaching bail.

The court documents allege that at 3am on July 27, Mr Tostee was detected 'travelling at high speed' in a silver Ford Falcon on the highway across the NSW border.

The court documents say NSW Police attempted to intercept the vehicle by throwing tyre spikes across the road, but the vehicle continued over the Queensland border until it came to a stop.

Queensland Police breathalysed Mr Tostee, who allegedly had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.203 - nearly five times more than the legal limit, it is alleged in court documents.

He had also breached bail conditions he had been placed on in January following the alleged incident on Ferny Avenue, according to the court documents.

The court documents about the charges which were filed included an alleged transcript of conversations between Mr Tostee and the late Warriena Wright inside his apartment on August 8, along with character references for Mr Tostee.

Justice Mullins adjourned Mr Tostee's bail application on the murder charge on Monday, giving Mr Tostee's defence team more time to revisit part of the bail application after the prosecution told the court Tostee was unlikely to have been on the balcony when Ms Wright plunged 14-storeys to her death.

'The prosecution case is that the applicant wasn't on the balcony that Ms Wright fell from?' Justice Mullins asked.

Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden replied: 'That appears to be the most likely scenario'.

Justice Mullins described the Crown prosecutor's case for murder as 'weak' and 'difficult', but said a case of manslaughter would be 'strong'.

Justice Mullins said a diagnosis of autism for Gable Tostee could have a bearing on how the court viewed what allegedly happened inside his Surfers Paradise apartment on the night Ms Wright died.

'If your client was not on the balcony, it makes the murder case a lot more difficult,' she told defence barrister Tony Kimmins.

'But in the context of what happened in the apartment, I would think a manslaughter case is not weak.'

Gable Tostee was out in Surfers Paradise on the night of January 27 this year, police say in court documents, when he told an officer to 'f*** off you c***' after he was accused of not paying for a tuk-tuk fare and allegedly 'causing alarm to members of the public' inside a convenience store
