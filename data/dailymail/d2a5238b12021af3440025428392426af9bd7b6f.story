Many people can reminisce about the amazing worlds they built with Lego as children, but few creations could be as impressive as the mountainous home of dwarves crafted by two teenagers.

Blake Baer, 17 and Jack Bittner, 18, from Pennsylvania U.S. have recreated one of the locations described in J.R.R. Tolkien’s novel, The Hobbit in painstaking detail, using a staggering 80,000 Lego bricks.

The duo chose to replicate Erebor using the small colour bricks, which is the home of the dwarves in the novel.

The pair invested over 400 hours making the detailed model, which includes a windmill, stream and marketplace beneath the towering mountain with its craggy face.

The model weighs 200 pounds and the peak of the mountain measures 56 inches tall, according to Gizmodo.

Baer and Bittner have shown off images of their creation ahead of the release of the second Hobbit film, which is called The Desolation of Smaug and is due to be released in the UK on December 13.

Writing on Lego fan site, MOC Pages Mr Baer said: 'I really enjoy building natural landscapes so I often build creations from Lord of the Rings, a fantastic book series by J.R.R. Tolkien that has some incredible landscapes in it.

'However, I try to branch out into other genres every so often. One of the best things about Lego in my opinion is that it is such an incredible medium to use your creativity and God-given talents to express your imagination in a material and understandable way.'

The model weighs 200 pounds and the peak of the mountain measures 56 inches tall and is made up of over 80,000 individual Lego bricks

It is not the first time the duo have created impressive models inspired by the children’s novel.

Last year, the pair made the elven sanctuary of Rivendell, which took them 100 hours of work and used over 50,000 Lego bricks.

However, while it was incredibly detailed, it was not quite as large as their current creation as it weighed 120 pounds and measured 40 by 30 inches.

Baer and Bittner explained their passion for the Hobbit-based models on social photo website, Flickr where they display the fruits of their labours.

'Due to both of our unique interests in Lord of the Rings and our supreme passion for the Lego brick, we decided to combine them into a creation for Brickfair 2012 … this was definitely the largest, hardest and most fun project that either of us have worked on,’ they said.

‘Because of our unique building styles, we complemented each other well and used the best of both our talents to great effect.’
