Smooth operators: Richard and Adam Johnson in one of their YouTube videos released before their BGT breakthrough

It's a classic Britain’s Got Talent story.

Two perfectly ordinary brothers with perfectly ordinary jobs – and a rather adorable nan – arrive on stage and belt out a stunning performance worthy of a professional duo.

Trouble is, that’s exactly what ‘sandwich makers’ Richard and Adam Johnson are.

Far from being amateurs, the brothers  have spent the past year performing at venues around the country and singing on P&O cruises.

They even released an album after being talent-spotted by legendary record producer Gordon Lorenz, who compared them to his former protégée Charlotte Church and branded them the ‘Panini Pavarottis’.

And while they do still help out at their parents’ sandwich business, which includes two franchises of high-street chain Subway, their mother admitted: ‘To be frank, sandwiches are not their passion.’

It’s the second time in days that the ITV talent show has been hit by a row over ‘fakery’. Last week Alice Fredenham was accused of faking her stage fright to endear herself to the judges.

It is not clear whether tenor Richard, 22, and his 19-year-old baritone brother Adam told the show’s producers in advance  that they were more than just ‘sandwich makers’.

During their performance on Saturday’s show the jumper-wearing brothers were at pains to emphasise their family roots and humble credentials. Their grandmother Lorna Slack, 70, joined them briefly on stage and couldn’t contain her pride.

Interviewed beforehand, Richard explained: ‘We’ve been singing really for three years around the house, as you do. Anywhere and everywhere and really we always sing for Nan.’

Once they got on stage, judge Amanda Holden asked: ‘Have you got a day job?’ Richard replied: ‘Yes, we both work in sandwich shops, don’t we?’ Simon Cowell quipped: ‘So you’re classical sandwich makers. This I’m looking forward to.’

The pair received a standing ovation for their performance of musical hit The Impossible Dream.

But it later emerged the pair have spent more time polishing their act than they were willing to admit on television.

In 2011 they were talent-spotted by Lorenz after they began singing at Temptations, a cafe owned by their parents Paul and Julie near their home in Holywell, North Wales.

After that they spent a season performing at the New Theatre in Bridlington, East Yorkshire. They also appeared alongside Ken Dodd at Liverpool’s Empire Theatre and performed with singer Joe Longthorne.

Homely: The talented brothers on the reality show's stage

Last year they released their first album, which Ricky Tomlinson plugged during an appearance on Loose Women. They had impressed the comedian when they sang at his Liverpool cabaret club, The Green Room. Yesterday, Mrs Johnson, 49, told the Daily Mail: ‘They just want to sing and that’s what they’ve been concentrating on more and more.

‘But they’re not yet able to earn enough money from singing to quit the day job so they’re still involved [in the family business] … just. They last worked here two or three weeks ago for a couple of days.’

In stark contrast to their homely appearance on Saturday, YouTube videos of their cruise ship routine show the brothers as slick entertainers in sharp suits.

Four months ago, Richard wrote on the site: ‘Adam and I are now a duo singing around the world, stay tuned!’ But they now seem less keen to boast about their professional experience. All references to their paid gigs have been removed from their official website.

A Britain’s Got Talent spokesman said: ‘Richard and Adam both work in the family’s sandwich shops in Wales. Over the past few months they’ve worked part time as they have been pursuing their dream of making a living from singing with occasional work on cruise ships and other small gigs.’ A show source said that, on average, the brothers had worked for two weeks a month at their parents’ shops this year.

They have worked on ten cruises since last August, and produced 1,000 copies of their self-made album to sell after those gigs.

They sang with Ken Dodd three times, and were paid ‘a couple of hundred pounds per performance’, the source said.
