Incredible live images of a chamber maid reporting Dominique Strauss-Kahn for alleged attempted rape were today broadcast on French television.

The CCTV images taken inside New York's Sofitel hotel show Nafissatou Diallo, 32, some 40 minutes after performing oral sex on the 62-year-old former International Monetary Fund boss.

Pictures shot inside the Times Square hotel on May 14th shows a clearly shocked Ms Diallo gesticulating wildly as she tells colleagues about what happened.

In turn, other images show Mr Strauss-Kahn checking out of the hotel, and heading off for lunch with his daughter in a yellow cab.

The hotel released the images through French TV news channel BFMTV because they want to put an end to conspiracy theories claiming Mr Strauss Kahn was set up by French government agents because he wanted to be the country’s next Socialist president.

Part of the footage shows two male hotel workers appearing to take part in some kind of 'victory dance' before high-fiving each other in a 13-second segment.

It is not clear why the hotel workers celebrate together, but reports of the episode fuelled speculation that Strauss-Kahn was set up by his political enemies.

U.S. investigative journalist Edward Epstein had claimed their ‘celebration’ lasted some three minutes, and made it look as though they had executed a trap to perfection.

In fact the tapes show that the ‘victory dance’ lasted less than 10 seconds, with the hotel staff allegedly celebrating a ‘sporting result’, according to a spokesman for the Sofitel.

Mr Epstein has since admitted a ‘mistake’, with the New York Review of Books, which originally published his conspiracy theory, publishing a correction.

Henri Leclerc, a lawyer for Mr Strauss-Kahn, admitted today: ‘I have no proof that there is a conspiracy. I have no evidence that there is a conspiracy.’

Mr Strauss-Kahn was arrested by U.S. police on May 14th and imprisoned, but after a lengthy legal process was finally cleared and returned home to Paris.

He admitted having a sexual encounter with Diallo, but said it was consensual.

Back in France, Mr Strauss-Kahn was accused by writer Tristane Banon, now 32, of trying to rape her in 2001, but the statute of time limitations on the case meant it could not be reopened.

Last week, 62-year-old Mr Strauss-Kahn claimed that his 'uninhibited' sex life cost him his chance to become president.

He is at the centre of a judicial inquiry into a vice-girl ring operating out of a hotel in Lille, northern France.

He has admitted attending 'sex parties' but said: 'I have a horror of prostitution and pimping. Can you imagine the damage caused to my wife, our children?'

At the weekend, France’s Interior Minister Claude Gueant revealed that Mr Strauss-Kahn was stopped by police in the Bois de Boulogne, a notorious red light area after dark, five years ago.

Mr Gueant also rubbished conspiracy theories linking President Nicolas Sarkozy with a bid to undermine his political rival.
