Martin Skrtel, Dejan Lovren and Mamadou Sakho were all simply woeful as Liverpool succumbed to a 3-1 defeat at West Ham.

The Hammers tore Brendan Rodgers' side apart in the opening exchanges, scoring twice in the opening seven minutes as Simon Mignolet, and the entire Reds defence all failed to impress.

Martin Skrtel and Dejan Lovren looked in utter disarray right from the start, with Winston Reid putting the Hammers ahead after less than 90 seconds, before Diafra Sakho made it two with an outrageous dinked chip over Simon Mignolet within seven minutes.

Not for the first time in his Liverpool career, Mignolet looked utterly lost inbetween the sticks as Stewart Downing sent a free kick high up to the far post, before James Tomkins nodded back across the six-yard box for Reid to finish into an open goal.

And just six minutes later the Reds stopper was left in no-mans land again as West Ham's Sakho found the top corner with an outrageous effort from the corner of the area.

Only the Senegalese international will know whether he actually meant it or not, but there is no doubt that left-back Alberto Moreno, whilst admittedly not the biggest culprit of sloppy defending on the night, should and could have done more to prevent it from happening.

Mamadou Sakho failed to make a single block, tackle or interception during his 70 minutes on the pitch

This was just Skrtel and Lovren's third start together, with their most recent outing alongside each other coming in their 3-1 defeat away at Manchester City. 

And they simply could not deal with the the power of Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho, who were both superb throughout.

Rodgers was in no mood to wait around and see if his defensive pair were going to gel during the course of the first-half, introducing Mamadou Sakho for right-back Javi Manquillo after just 20 minutes and switching to a back three.

And the move brought immediate dividends as Raheem Sterling brought them back just short of 30 minutes, slamming one home from the edge of the area after Mario Balotelli's blocked shot had fallen into his path.

But at the back there was still no cohesion or organisation whatsoever, somewhat metaphorically reflected by the clash of heads between Mamadou Sakho and Lovren that left the Croatian requiring a lengthy period of treatment - and head injury that perhaps should have seen him withdrawn at half time.

Going into the second half at 2-1 down, Rodgers decided the wisest course of action would be to throw caution to the wind and use his second substution to introduce the attack-minded Adam Lallana for Lucas.

In attack they looked brighter, but every time West Ham broke away, Liverpool's three-man defence looked hopeless and helpless.

With just over 20 minutes to go, Skrtel failed to control a simple backpass and let Diafra Sakho steal the ball off him on the edge of the area. But the Slovakian defender was let off on this occasion as the West Ham forward proved far less clinical with his attempt than he did with his superb finish in the first half.

Morgan Amalfitono's goal that sealed the result came right through the heart of Liverpool's defence

With just a few minutes to go, however, Mamadou Sakho was not so lucky as yet another lapse at the back really did prove defining.

Dragged out to the left-hand side, he prodded a feeble header straight into the path of the onrushing Downing. There was no other way to describe it than as a simply inexplicable moment of ineptitude from the French international.

The former England winner then drove right at the heart of Liverpool's haphazard defence, before providing a slide-rule pass into the path of Morgan Amalfitano, who made no mistake with the finish.

3-1. Game over. 

Skrtel's sliding challenge couldn't stop Morgan Amalfitano putting the game beyond Liverpool at 3-1

Brendan Rodgers has a lot to think about in terms of defensive organisation ahead of their next game

Liverpool conceded two or more goals in 16 of their Premier League games last season. They managed to wrestle 23 points out of a possible 48 in those games, but it is something that will need to be addressed if they are to challenge again at the Premier League summit this time round. 

On many occasions last campaign, their sheer potency up front was enough to dig them out of trouble. But in the post-Luis Suarez era, and with Mario Balotelli once again quiet (and Daniel Sturridge out injured), they no longer possess such a luxury.

If Liverpool are hoping to challenge again this campaign, their defence is going to have to be infinitely more resolute than it was here. Rodgers and his boys have a lot of work to do.
