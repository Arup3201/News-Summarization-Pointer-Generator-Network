A father who died in the South Wales measles epidemic had been seen by an out-of-hours GP the day before his death, his family said.

Gareth Colfer-Williams' mother said her son was so ill he could 'barely stand' and said he was seen by three GPs before his death, who prescribed him paracetamol.

The 25-year-old is the first person to die in the measles epidemic and his mother Angela Colfer said her son should have been admitted to hospital before his death on Thursday.

Mr Colfer-Williams, who also suffered
from asthma, lived in the Pont Tennant area of Swansea, which is at the
centre of the epidemic area.

There are more than 800 confirmed cases of the disease in the Swansea outbreak that has left at least 77 in hospital.

A record number of people in the area have now been inoculated against measles as authorities try to get the epidemic under control.

Health officials have also warned the public to expect more people to die from the disease.

Mrs
Colfer, 53, said she took her son to the doctors on Wednesday but he 
was found dead at his home by girlfriend Cairo Oneim the following day.

She said: 'He could barely stand but he didn’t have any rash on his arms then.

'He was seen by three GPs who had a look at him and all gave him a prescription of paracetamol.

'He should have been admitted that night.'

Mrs Colfer said the family are devastated by his death and urged parents to vaccinate their children.

She said: 'It’s a terrible, unbearable feeling and our lives will never ever be the same.

'I only had one son and I could not have wished for a better, more loving, loyal son. I was very proud of him.

'He was the best father, son, brother and partner anyone could wish for and he was besotted with his baby daughter Dakota. She has lost her dad and Cairo has lost her partner.'

She added: 'Get your children vaccinated and get yourselves vaccinated. I wouldn't want anyone to go through the tragedy that we are going through.

'Gareth has taken part of us with him and we can never get it back.'

Health officials confirmed Mr Colfer-Williams had measles when he died and a post-mortem is being held to determine whether the disease contributed to his death.

Mr Colfer-Williams had recently been treated at Morriston Hospital but Public Health Wales said that he was not treated for measles or diagnosed with the contagious disease by a GP before his death.

A PHW spokeswoman said: 'Measles is a notifiable disease, so by law if a doctor or GP diagnoses a case of measles they have to notify us.

'If he had been diagnosed with measles before his death we would have known about it.

'We ran tests following his death to see if he had measles because he had the symptoms of the disease when he died.

'And the post mortem tests showed he had measles at the time of his death.'

It is now almost six months since the first measles cases emerged in the greater Swansea area where the epidemic is centred.

The disease was slow to spread before Christmas but the number of cases rose with alarming rapidity from the start of March.

A private clinic, which has a centre in Swansea, and offers single vaccinations for measles and rubella has been criticised for 
suggesting a link between autism and the MMR jab.

Two million children are believed to be at risk of catching measles as a result of the MMR scare.

Teenagers aged between 13 and 15 are 
more likely to be susceptible to measles because of the controversy over
the since-discredited report about MMR jabs being linked to autism in 
the late 1990s.

The measles epidemic has already infected more than 800 people in South Wales

Former doctor Andrew Wakefield's report in the 1990s first suggested a link between the triple vaccine and bowel disease and autism. His research was later discredited and he was struck off in 2010.

However, doctors have warned that unfounded fears about the vaccination has left children unprotected.

Ten years ago, 45 per cent of 
five-year-olds in London failed to have the required two doses of 
vaccine. Last year the figure was 81 per cent.

The Children's Immunisation Centre is offering single measles and rubella vaccinations in Swansea for up to £110.

A full course costs up to £730, while the MMR is free on the NHS.

The centre says on its website that 'single MMR vaccination is recommended' and tells parents to 'be wise' and choose individual jabs.

The company, which has clinics in London, Swansea, Birmingham and Manchester, says: 'We believe that our approach and the vaccines we use are the safest for 
your child  in order to be protected from the Measles Mumps and Rubella 
(German Measles) diseases.'

However, no single mumps vaccine is currently available in the UK.

Last year, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ordered the company to remove advertisements for a mumps vaccine as the agency considers it unsafe.

An agency spokesman told The Sunday Times: 'We have significant concerns about the quality of the single mumps vaccine that the Children's Immunisation Centre (CIC) is attempting to supply.'

CIC director Fiona Dickson defended her company and said there is a link between the MMR and autism.

She told The Sunday Times: 'Autism is running at one in 66 for boys in
England. Are we going to ignore these women, these parents?'

She added that the mumps vaccine produced by her company abroad was safe.

The Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board has administered vaccinations to thousands of people at drop-in clinics throughout Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend to try and bring the epidemic under control.

More than 1,800 people were vaccinated yesterday as people flocked to the clinics, possibly driven by heightened fear after the disease claimed its first victim.

Due to the success of the weekend vaccination sessions health chiefs announced they will be held for a further weekend as well.

An Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University (ABMU) Health Board spokesman said: 'Over 1,800 people were vaccinated at ABMU Health Board's four drop-in MMR clinics today - the highest number yet.

'Many of the 1,825 given MMR jabs were older schoolchildren, teenagers and young adults, as well as babies and toddlers having their vaccinations earlier than normal during the measles outbreak.'

Sara Hayes, ABMU's director of public health, said she was delighted with the turn out.

'I'm really pleased. We have seen a steady flow of people throughout the day; and I'm particularly delighted to see a higher number of older children and teenagers come through the door, as they are our main target group.'
