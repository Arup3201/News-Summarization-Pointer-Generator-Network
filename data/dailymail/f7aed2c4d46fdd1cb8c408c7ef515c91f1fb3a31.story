A shark scientist has found a 200lb sea lion inside the stomach of one of nature's largest predators.

The animal was lunch for the a gigantic 12-foot Mako shark that was caught off the coast of Southern California by commercial fishermen.

Dr Antonella Preti has dissected over 2,000 stomachs in a bid to unravel mysteries of aquatic food chains, but the Mako shark's is her biggest yet.

Dr Preti at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) found a sea lion weighing 200lb (91 kg) that was largely intact but had a flipper missing and multiple puncture-like bites to its body, inside the shark's stomach.

The stomach also harboured other bones that she plans on cleaning and identifying, according to the video which shows the dissection.

To date, Ms Preti has dissected more than 200 from Mako shark stomachs to work out what the 'apex'  predators eat at the top of the food chain, LiveScience reported.

The huge sharks regulate the populations of mid level predators, such as sea lions by mainly eating old and sick animals, which keeps the overall population healthier.

Consequently if the sharks disappear, there is a negative knock-on effect to their local ecosystem and the food chain.

According to the NOAA, up to 100 million sharks are killed each year for their meat - particularly their fins, which are used to make shark-fin soup and can fetch up to £380 a pound.

The soup is a delicacy in China and can cost up to £108 a bowl despite containing high levels of toxins such as mercury.

Some species of shark such as the Gulper, are also at risk of 'livering' when their liver is removed by fisherman and their carcass tossed overboard as waste.

Shark livers are in demand as their livers and specifically a substance found in them called squalene, that helps control their buoyancy in water, is used in some luxury beauty creams.

Ms Preti spends time washing bones and straining gastric juices from the shark's stomach to build up a thorough picture of the animal's recent meals

The premium substance costs up to £18,000 a ton.

Mako Sharks eat anything but are partial to fish, squid, sea birds, other sharks and of course sea lions.

Ms Preti spends times washing bones and 
straining gastric juices to build up a thorough picture of the animals' 
recent meals and said 'you can find all sorts of things in there.'

This is the shark's stomach before the contents are emptied and examined. Ms Preti described the stomach lining as similar to a 'blanket' in size and said some of the strangest things she has found in sharks' stomachs include 24 pork steaks wrapped in paper, a soggy salad and even a bullet

Commercial fishermen caught the giant shark, which weighed 600 kilograms, and donated its organs to science.

Ms Preti's research is important as it gives scientists a picture of how the food chain works and the ecology and biology of sharks, which she believes is essential in order to work out a way of managing fisheries and helping species in the future.
