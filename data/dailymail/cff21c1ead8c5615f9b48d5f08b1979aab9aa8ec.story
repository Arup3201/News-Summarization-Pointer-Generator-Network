A rare white tiger that has appeared at rallies during Pakistan's election season has died of dehydration.

The tiger, a mascot of the conservative Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party, often appeared at events led by the party chief's daughter Maryam Nawaz.

It fell unconscious and was taken to the University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences in Lahore on Tuesday night.

The white tiger has been a frequent sight at rallies for the political party Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz - but died following 30C heat

But vets could not save the animal, which belonged to a party worker, and it died yesterday morning.

Live tigers and lions are a familiar sight to those at PML-N's rallies. Last week a complaint was made to the Election Commission but it said the matter did not fall under its remit, reports Dawn.

The World Wide Fund for Nature said white tigers are extremely sensitive to heat and noise and that the animal could not cope with Lahore's 30C heat and the noise of the rallies.

The WWF said it is supporting a petition by actor and conservationist Faryal Gohar at the Lahore High Court against the illegal use of wild animals at rallies.
