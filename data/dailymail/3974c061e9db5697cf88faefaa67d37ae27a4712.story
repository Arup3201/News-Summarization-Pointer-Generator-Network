Mike Tindall showed off his soft side yesterday as his carried baby daughter on to the pitch after what could be the final home game of his rugby career.

The proud father, 35, beamed as he cradled 15-week-old Mia while striding across the pitch at the Kingsholm Stadium, Gloucester, after his side beat London Irish 38-30.

Tindall's wife Zara, daughter of the Princess Royal, was watching from the stands. She had dressed Mia in a Gloucester strip to match her father's.

It was an emotional day for Tindall, who is understood to be poised to announce his retirement from rugby union.

After the match, the 75-times capped centre tweeted: 'Looks like the last game at Kingsholm has been played. Gutted it has to end. Good win to finish though. Love to the #glawsfamily.'

When asked about the tweet outside the changing rooms, Tindall cryptically said: 'I don't want to say anything now - I will do it at some point next week.

'There will be plenty of time next week.'
