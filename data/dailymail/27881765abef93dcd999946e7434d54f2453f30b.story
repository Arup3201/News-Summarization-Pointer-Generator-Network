His job is to discipline Tory MPs – but Michael Gove was on the receiving end of a dressing down yesterday in front of his Cabinet colleagues.

The PM's Chief Whip had broken one of the most basic rules of government ... and allowed his phone to go off during the ministers' weekly conference.

The former Education Secretary's mobile rang as Chancellor George Osborne spoke about the latest drop in inflation, The Times reported. Instead of quickly muting the sound, Mr Gove fumbled for 'quite a while' before he was able to switch it off. The ringtone was described variously as a 'female ballad' and 'Jazz-FM style' music for 'after a heavy night out'.

The Prime Minister was forced to stop a cabinet meeting to ask chief whip, Michael Gove, to switch his mobile phone off

When asked why he had chosen the ringtone, Mr Gove said it was an 'in-joke'.

David Cameron is said to have interrupted the meeting and asked Mr Gove to turn off his phone immediately, before reminding him that mobiles are banned from the Cabinet meeting room; ministers typically leave them in a box outside for security reasons. The reaction from Mr Cameron – a long-standing friend of Mr Gove – was described as a 'public b******ing' by witnesses.

Mr Gove was moved in the summer reshuffle, which saw him replaced as Education Secretary by Nicky Morgan. The change was viewed as a demotion by some, but the PM stressed that he wanted one of his 'big hitters' to take over as Chief Whip.

Mr Gove may take solace from the fact that he is not the first high-profile politician to forget to switch off his mobile. Gordon Brown's speech at the Davos economic summit in 2009 was interrupted when his own phone went off. 

Ministers who were at the meeting reportedly said that Mr Cameron's reaction was like a public b******ing'
