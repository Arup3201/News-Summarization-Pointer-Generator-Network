He's no stranger to backstage bust-ups and now Charlie Sheen is said to be at loggerheads with his beautiful Anger Management co-star Selma Blair.

Sheen is refusing to shoot the FX show if Blair is present on the set after the pair had a huge falling out, it is being reported.

Sheen, 47, is even said to have fired the 40-year-old actress after allegedly hearing reports that she'd badmouthed him to executives at the network.

'At war': Selma Blair has reportedly angered Charlie Sheen so much that he won't set foot on the set of his show unless she is removed

Chemistry: The pair worked well on screen, but apparently things weren't so rosy behind the cameras

According to TMZ, Selma told bosses that she doesn't rate Charlie's work ethic and complained that he's often late.

When he found out, Sheen allegedly complained that as the star of the show he has '40 pages of lines per episode compared to her two.'

He then fired the actress, though it's not clear he's actually in a position to do this, and told bosses he wouldn't show up to work on Monday if Blair was still attached to the project.

Another frisky moment: At another moment in the episode, Selma was stripping off again as things got steamy with Charlie

Complicated relationship: Charlie and Selma's character Kate are best friends in the show, but regularly end up in bed together

All over each other: The couple seem to always be stripping off around each other, even though they're 'just friends'

What's more, TMZ also contend that 
Charlie wants to hire Mila Kunis - the girlfriend of his Two and a Half 
Men replacement Ashton Kutcher - at $1 million dollars per episode.

Replacement? Charlie is reportedly lining up Mila for a role

Mail Online have yet to hear back from Blair's spokesperson.

Blair
has been a hit as Sheen's best friend Kate, a fellow therapist with 
whom Sheen's character has an ongoing sexual relationship.

The pair's on-screen chemistry has been praised copiously by TV critics.

Charlie's character is a therapist 
specialising in anger management, and took on the musician Cee Lo Green 
in one hilarious episode - only to have him interrupt his love-making 
with Selma.

Trying to curb his anger issues, Cee 
Lo's character gets Charlie to do all his dirty work for him, including 
firing members of his staff and breaking up with his girlfriend.

But
the final straw is when he interrupts the romantic session between him 
and Kate, which started earlier in the episode when the pair romped on 
the couch.
