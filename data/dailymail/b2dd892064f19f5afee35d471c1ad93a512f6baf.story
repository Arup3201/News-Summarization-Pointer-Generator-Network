Europe's biggest engineering firm is to slash 15,000 jobs in a £5billion cost-cutting drive.

Germany-based Siemens will shed the jobs over the next year, a third of them in Germany and the rest abroad, in a move that will save about 6billion euros.

The cull represents about 4 per cent of its 370,000-strong workforce but it says it is aiming to avoid compulsory redundancies, according to a spokesman. The company employs 13,000 in Britain.

Cost-cutters: German firm Siemens is slashing 15,000 jobs as it looks to save 6billion euros and move closer to US rivals

The announcement comes two months after the ousting of Chief Executive Peter Loescher, who drew up the savings plan late last year.

Europe’s biggest engineering firm, whose products range from hearing aids to gas turbines, is anxious to close the gap with more profitable rivals such as U.S.-based General Electric Co and Switzerland’s ABB.

Siemens and its unions have reached an agreement over about half of the job cuts and a deal on the other half will follow, the spokesman said.

He added that Siemens wanted to end speculation in the market about the number of jobs that are about to be cut.

No workers have been laid off so far and Siemens has said it does not intend to make enforced redundancies, relying in stead on attrition and voluntary severance deals.

In Germany, about 2,000 jobs will be cut at the company’s industrial unit and another 1,400 at its energy and infrastructure business, the spokesman said.

Siemens expects to close the current fiscal year on Monday with around 370,000 workers, the same as last year.

The announcement comes just days after warnings the eurozone economy will not grow this year and that the region remains ‘a considerable source of risk’ to the rest of the world.

Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, told a conference in Lisbon that growth will not return until 2014.

He also warned that it will take years to tackle record high unemployment across the region.

German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said there would be no change in tack in Berlin’s handling of the crisis following the re-election of Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Alikely ‘grand coalition’ with her centre-left rivals raised hopes in some European capitals that Germany will be less focused on austerity to overcome the single currency bloc’s debt crisis.

But Schaeuble said: ‘We have held our ground in our euro policies. Countries with solid financial figures have the better and more sustainable economic development.’
