Jessie Burton won a prestigious literary prize for her debut novel which she wrote backstage during theatre shows

An actress-turned-writer has won a prestigious literary prize for her debut novel which she wrote backstage during theatre shows.

Jessie Burton's The Miniaturist beat seven other books, including Man Booker Prize Richard Flanagan's The Narrow Road To The Deep North, to be named Waterstones' Book of the Year.

She said: 'It is a thrill, a pleasure and a true honour to be voted Waterstones' Book of the Year 2014. 

'It's particularly special as the title was chosen by booksellers, and I am indebted to their passion for The Miniaturist and their desire to spread the word to readers. 

'It's all any writer could wish for. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that Waterstones has played a large part in changing my life and I will always be grateful for this incredible award.'

The book, described as 'an atmospheric literary thriller', is set in seventeenth century Amsterdam and is already a bestseller.

It was written over several years while Ms Burton acted on stage, including a stint at the National Theatre in London, and worked as a temp in the City in between acting jobs.

The book will benefit from publicity campaigns in the chain's shops across the UK with a guaranteed increase in sales.

Waterstones' boss James Daunt said: 'This is a first novel of vivid excitement and a thrilling discovery.

From the moment of its publication in the summer it has fired the imagination of our booksellers and their customers. 

'In a year of such exceptionally strong publishing, The Miniaturist has richly deserved its stunning success.'
