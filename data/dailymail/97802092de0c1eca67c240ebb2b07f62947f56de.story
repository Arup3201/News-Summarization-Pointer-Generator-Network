Microsoft designers are working on a touch-enabled watch as the company aims to cash in on the anticipated boom in wearable electronics, it has been claimed.

The computing giant reportedly asked Asian suppliers to ship 1.5in displays for a potential watch- style device and one supply executive said he had met with Microsoft researchers and developers.

Whether Microsoft will actually end up producing the watch is uncertain, but some investors and technology firms are expecting a boom in wearable electronics, reported the Wall Street Journal.

The U.S. company experimented with smartwatches in 2004 with a product called SPOT, which used FM radio signals to send instant messages and view news headlines, reported CNN.

But production ceased four years later and the SPOT project, which stood for Smart Personal Object Technology, was eventually pulled last year. Smartwatches come with a 37-year history.

Some new gadgets such as Nike’s FuelBand are intended to measure physical exercise, while others can perform similar functions to a smartphone such as receiving text messages or taking photos.

California-based startup firm Pebble Technology now makes a watch that wirelessly synchronises with smartphones and vibrates to alert users of incoming phone calls, emails and Twitter posts.

And Google is developing a smartwatch as well as its eyewear gadget Google Glass. The search giant is set to use its Android software and will battle against Apple's iWatch and a Samsung gadget.

‘We see growing demand for wearable gadgets as the size of the smartphone has become too big to carry around,’ analyst Wanli Wang told the Wall Street Journal.

‘A smartwatch that is compatible with a smartphone and other electronics devices would be attractive to consumers.’

One research firm anticipates the market for wearable smart electronics to be a £7billion industry within just three years.
