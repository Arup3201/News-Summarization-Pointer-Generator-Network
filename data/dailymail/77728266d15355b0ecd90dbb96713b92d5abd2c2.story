Fresh evidence emerged last night revealing the extent to which blue chip companies uncovered personal details of individuals for more than a decade.

Investigators were hired by insurance companies, finance firms and solicitors since 2001 to make ‘hundreds of thousands’ of bogus calls.

A ‘blaggers’ manual’ has now been uncovered which was used to get hold of private information from institutions such as the NHS, the Royal Mail, Customs & Excise and Social Security.

Worrying: Fresh evidence emerged last night revealing the extent to which blue chip companies used to uncover personal details of individuals from instiutions such as the Royal Mail

A Benefits Agency and Inland Revenue Data project (BAIRD) report has exposed the increasing black market in the trading of private data obtained illegally.

Keith Vaz MP, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, told the Independent: ‘This is extraordinary that there’s so much detail in this [blagging] document that will allow individuals to extract so much private information.

‘What is required now is that there should be full transparency into what these private investigators have been doing.

‘We need to make sure Soca and the Metropolitan Police should be able to follow the evidence wherever it leads... to uncover the truth about what has been happening.

Speaking out: Keith Vaz MP, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, expressed his concern over the revelations

‘More importantly, I think it’s necessary that those who have deliberately or unwittingly sought information about individuals or organisations should come clean and tell us precisely why they sought information and what they have done with it.’

The Baird Report listed the activities of a number of investigations agencies involved in blagging.

One woman based in Wales, was raided by the ICO in 2000, and was found to be  ‘responsible for thousands of bogus calls’.

The report said that much of their work was for the now defunct bank London Scottish, which was itself raided by the ICO in November 2000, several years before it collapsed in 2008.

‘They did a great deal of work for London Scottish and were also dropped like a hot potato as soon as London Scottish found out involvement of [ICO],’ said the report.

The raid on London Scottish’s Manchester offices on 19 November 2000 ‘caused a great deal of consternation not only with them but within the financial industry as a whole,’ the report said.

‘While they claim they are giving every assistance they are in fact being deliberately obtuse, and using every legal delaying tactic in the book.’

The Baird report makes clear that the ICO was unhappy with London Scottish’s use of a network of tracing agents, including the companies Intersearch, V Chasers and Solent Credit, all of which were later prosecuted for unlawful activities. No prosecutions were brought against London Scottish.
