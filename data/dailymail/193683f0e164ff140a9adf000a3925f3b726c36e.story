Eden Hazard tucked into his new £200,000-a-week Chelsea deal by enjoying an evening of fine dining with Belgium international team-mates Marouane Fellaini and Christian Benteke on Thursday.

The trio were joined by their national team physio Lieven Maesschalck as they put aside their Premier League club rivalries to celebrate Hazard's new contract.

Accompanied with the caption, 'Great evening with my bros. @felli31 @christianbenteke25 @movetocure,' it even appears that the 24-year-old was in a generous mood with the bill beside him in the Instagram photo he uploaded.

The 24-year-old's new deal is set to be worth up to £200,000-a-week and totaling £57million

Earlier on Thursday, it was announced by the Blues that their star talisman had penned a new five-and-a-half-year deal - as he became the first big-money beneficiary of the lucrative Premier League TV rights deal.

The midfielder's new deal totals £57million and comes in a week that the Premier League confirmed a £5billion deal with Sky Sports and BT Sport to show live matches over three seasons from the start of the 2016-17 campaign.

'The manager has helped me improve a lot, the fans have been fantastic and I have an amazing understanding with my team-mates,' Hazard said upon extending his stay at Stamford Bridge.

'I always try to give pleasure to the supporters with my style of play and it is nice to know they appreciate my work.

'I hope we can repay that support by winning lots of trophies, beginning with the Capital One Cup at Wembley, and after that, we can push hard towards the end of the season.'

Hazard has played an integral role for the Blues since joining from Lille in a £32million deal in 2012.

This season he has scored 13 goals in 37 appearances for Chelsea, in all competitions, as they chase a Premier League, Champions League and Capital One Cup treble.
