After thousands of people rallied to help a Connecticut woman find her two lost dogs, city officials have put the kibosh on an important tool in her search: The thousands of 'lost dogs' posters posted on city property.

Amanda Denes returned home from work on February 27, to find her home ransacked and her two French bulldog-schnauzer mixes - Burton and Zuzu - missing.

Denes took to social media in her search for her missing mutts, starting a Facebook page that quickly gained thousands of 'likes.'

Missing: Amanda Denes lost her two dogs - Burton and Zuzu - when someone broke into her house last month

Reward: There currently is a $5,000 reward for the safe return of the two French bulldog-schauzer mixes

Spreading the word on social media and throughout the community helped Denes raise enough money to buy a billboard along a busy highway and to offer a $5,000 reward.

Supporters also helped spread the word by plastering donated flyers throughout the city on several utility poles, traffic light poles, bus stops and city owned garbage cans.

This, however, proved to be too much for city officials - West Hartford has a specific ordinance that prohibits people from posting signs on public property, including telephone poles and bus stops.

'It's everywhere. It's overwhelming,' Public Works Director John 
Phillips told the Hartford Courant. 'There must be hundreds. Public infrastructure is not the
 venue to display that.'

'I sympathize, but after the dogs are found, do people take them down?' Phillips said. 'They become blight and litter.'

Social media: A social media campaign raised enough money for Denes to buy a billboard on a busy freeway

On Tuesday, Environmental Services Manager Dave Gabriele informed Denes that she had two weeks to remove the signs.

'I tried to be as sympathetic as I could; my wife and I were dog 
owners,' Gabriele told the paper.

He says that as sympathetic as he is to the cause, 'we've been real 
consistent with how we've addressed these [types of] signs.'

The town could potentially fine Denes if the signs aren't removed, but Gabriele says 'we're not looking to be punitive. We're always looking to resolve the issue.'

Gabriele suggests that Denes and her army of supporters use lawn signs and bulletin boards in private businesses, but that she needs to refrain from posting the signs on public property.Â 

He added that the town has been very lenient about the signs, but that when there are complaints, the city needs to act.

Anyone with info about the two pooches is asked to contact Denes or authorities in Hartford

'I get it. A corner becomes a great place to get your point across,' he 
said. But 'where do you draw the line between a person looking for their
 dog and a business advertising gutter cleaning?'

Denes says she's not happy that the city is forcing her to tone down her search, but says she understands that officials are only doing their jobs.

All Denes cares about is getting her dogs back, but she's asked supporters to no longer post signs on public property, and that she would try to have the ones already posted removed.

Denes says the $5,000 reward for the dogs won't get any higher, but wants anyone with information to call her - no questions asked, according to the paper.

'Except my love, they're not worth anything,' she said.
