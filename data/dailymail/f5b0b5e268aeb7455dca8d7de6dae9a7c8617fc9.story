Killer: Steven Hayes, who is on death row, boasted that he had killed 17 people and taken their sneakers as trophies

A Connecticut man convicted of killing a mother and her two daughters in a deadly home invasion bragged about how he killed 17 others and raped dozens of women in leaked letters revealed today.

Steven Hayes described in chilling detail how in two of the attacks he had tied up, tortured and killed women â€“ and even made a 16-hour video of him murdering one of his victims.

The 48-year-old serial killer, who is on death row for his role in the 2007 home invasion, boasted to a female companion about how he had collected the sneakers of all of his victims as trophies, but said 'the 17 kill trophies' meant the most to him.

Hayes was last year convicted of 
raping and strangling Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, before tying her 
daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela, 11, to their beds and setting the 
house on fire. He is currently appealing the conviction.

Earlier this month, his accomplice was
 Joshua Komisarjevsky, was also convicted for his role in the killings 
and is due to be sentenced on Tuesday.

In the four letters, which were 
written in August and September, Hayes wrote that he would have killed 
Komisarjevsky if he had not been jailed because while he had the same 
'capacity for evil', he was not committed enough.

Hayes told a female in North Carolina,
 only identified as 'Lynn', that he wanted to share his 'dark secret' as
 'someone else really should know the truth about' him.

'Yes, I've killed before,' Hayes wrote in the letters which were obtained by the New Haven Register.

'I have 17 kills throughout the Northeast United States. Perfect victims and well executed, controlled endeavors.'

In the 17 pages of handwritten 
letters, which were confiscated by prison authorities, Hayes gleefully 
recounted the rape and murder of his first victim in 1982 and his 
eighth.

He wrote that all of his victims were aged between 14 and 25.

The New Haven Register, which has not 
detailed how it acquired the letters, reported that the letters read 
'like a twisted pornographic fantasy'.

Hayes wrote that he spotted his first 
victim, a girl who was hitchhiking, as he was driving home from a bar. 
He described her as 'short, hot and the perfect victim'.

'Like any great hunter, timing is critical,' he wrote about how he chose his victims.

Hayes told how he picked up the girl 
and drove her to a secluded location where he tied her up and threw her 
in the trunk before taking her to a cheap motel, which he said became 
his 'location of choice' for his attacks.

According to the newspaper, he 
described in detail how he sexually assaulted the woman and then pinched
 her nose and suffocated her.

'A monster was born,' he wrote.

'This carried on with my top 17 sexual
 conquests and kills,' he wrote according to the Register. 'The 
trophies, the signature kill, the thrill of the hunt and the disposal of
 my adventure buddies.'

Hayes said that he picked up his 
eighth victim, who he found drunk walking along a road, and told her he 
would take her back to his house to smoke crack cocaine and drink beer.

He claimed that he tied her to his bed for an entire weekend and tortured her before killing her.

'The more pain and emotional abuse she went through, the better I liked it,' he said. 'And believe me, I was in heaven.'

Hayes claimed that he recorded the 
assault and killing on a 16-hour video, which he described as 'by far 
the best snuff film ever created'.

He said that he kept hold of the tape for six months before it 'found a home' in Portland, Oregon.

Komisarjevsky, who could also face the
 death penalty for his part in the attacks, was described as being a 
disappointment to Hayes in the letters.

'I've searched my whole life for 
someone who could embrace and had the capacity for evil as I possess,' 
Hayes wrote, according to the Register. 'I thought I finally found it in
 Josh.'

'But events show Josh, while [he] had
 the proper evil intent, lacked in the most serious aspects, commitment 
and control,' he added.

State Attorney Michael Dearington 
and an FBI spokesman have declined to say whether Hayes' purported 
crimes are being investigated or whether authorities are aware of 17 
unsolved homicides matching details in his letters.

Hayes asked the recipient to hold on 
to the details of the letters until after his execution because the 
information 'could be worth millions to the right people.'

Hayes' attorney, Thomas Ullman, declined to comment.
