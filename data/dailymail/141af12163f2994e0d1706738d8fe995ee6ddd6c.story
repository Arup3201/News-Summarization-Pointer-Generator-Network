A young Briton remains in a grave condition with head and back injuries after plunging from the balcony of his second-floor hotel room at Magaluf in Majorca.

Daniel Geary, 23, fell on Sunday evening after drinking with friends in the resort on the Spanish island’s southwest coast.

He landed on his back about 20ft below his room at the three-star Hotel Martinique - the same hotel from which another Briton fell and died last month.

Resort: Five Britons have fallen from hotels in Magaluf in six weeks, three of them fatally

A senior Civil Guard officer in Palma, the holiday island’s nearby capital, said yesterday: 'This appears to have been an accident possibly induced by heavy drinking. Skylarking was not involved.'

The incident came only two days after blonde Chantelle Serginson, 24, from Middlesbrough, had a miracle escape when she fell 80ft from her sixth-floor balcony in the same resort last Friday.

Her fall was broken by a canopy and 
she was well enough by Sunday to be moved out of intensive care to an 
ordinary hospital ward.

Three other Britons have died in separate hotel falls in Magaluf in the space of three weeks.

Adam Atkinson, 20, from Castleford in West Yorkshire, died on April 17 after falling from the third floor of the same hotel as Mr Geary.

Mr Atkinson was climbing up the stairwell when he lost his balance.

Benjamin Harper, 28, died three days later after falling from the fifth floor of the four-star Hotel Antillas.

On May 5, Charlotte Faris, 23, from Codicote near Stevenage, Hertfordshire, fell to her death shortly after checking into the resort’s one-star Teix Hotel.

Concerns: Daniel Geary, 23, is the latest Briton to hurt himself after falling in Majorca
