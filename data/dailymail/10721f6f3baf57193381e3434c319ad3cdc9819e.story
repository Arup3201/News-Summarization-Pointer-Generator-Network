A nasty showdown erupted on the set of The View last Thursday when the show's moderator Whoopi Goldberg and co-host Rosie O'Donnell got into a heated spat in front of the studio audience.

Rosie was upset because Whoopi cut her off on a 'Hot Topic' subject that O'Donnell indicated she was passionate about backstage before the show. The segment ran out of time and Whoopi had to cut to a commercial, a show insider tells MailOnline exclusively.

The 'Hot Topic' was on spanking and the segment was running long, so producers told Whoopi it was time to go to commercial break in her ear. Rosie refuses to wear an ISD monitor in her ear so the control room is unable to speak to her.

Showdown: Rosie O'Donnell took it personally when The View's moderator Whoopi Goldberg cut her off from a 'Hot Topic" on spanking being discussed on the show

Hug it out: Looks can be deceiving, especially between Rosie and Whoopi. Show sources say there's no love lost between the co-hosts

Whoopi told her that if she had an ear monitor, she would have known what was going on. When Whoopi did the abrupt cut to commercial, when Rosie let loose, the insider said.

'As soon as they went to commercial break, Rosie took the handheld microphone that they use to engage the audience,' explains the tipster. 

'Instead of talking to the crowd, Rosie spoke directly to Whoopi in the mic that she "hurt my feelings," and that she was "very upset by it" and "didn't appreciate" what Whoopi had done.'

Standing to the side without a microphone, Whoopi responded by saying: 'This isn't the time for this, Rosie.'

Instead of moving on, O'Donnell continued to gripe openly in front of the audience in the microphone about what she perceived as an on-air snub.

'Well I just don't appreciate you saying that you were going to do something and not doing it. It makes me upset and I just don't want to have to go through this,' O'Donnell continued.

Goldberg, looking annoyed, shot back: 'I said this was not the time Rosie.'

Not phased by the Oscar winner's petition to leave matters alone until after the show, the 52-year-old comedienne continued to vent about Whoopi's actions.

The View moderator then fired back to Rosie: 'F*** it, I told you to leave it alone and you just don't want to listen. If you want to go there Rosie, I will dammit. I'm really sick of your s***!'

A hush fell over the studio.

Love you, mean it? Rosie O'Donnell and newbies Rosie Perez (left of Rosie) and Nicolle Wallace put their hands together for returning Whoopi in the season premier. But show insiders say Rosie wants to rule the roost as moderator

'At this point, you could've heard a pin drop. It was like everything came to a standstill and Rosie finally backed down,' the source explained.

New co-host Rosie Perez then jumped up and made light of the moment, ending the quiet that had fallen over the room.

'Oh s***, Twitter is going to be off the hook now,' Perez quipped, causing the crowd to laugh. 'They're about to get it,' she continued.

Producers hurried over to the two ladies with notes and information regarding the next segment and when the show returned live, it was as though nothing had gone wrong.

Relations between Rosie and Whoopi behind the scenes at The View have been tense since the beginning of the season, as sources believe that O'Donnell really wants to be in her old moderator role and is having a hard time playing second fiddle to Goldberg. 

Additionally, Goldberg has begged ABC to terminate her contract with the network and pay her the remaining $10 million on her deal to go home, as she hates working on the show now, particularly with all of the changes.

Kiss and make up:  After Rosie and Whoopi's heated exchange, 'you could've heard a pin drop,' said a show insider. 'It was like everything came to a standstill and Rosie finally backed down,' the source explained

Sources at The View tell MailOnline that Rosie has been a terror from the get-go, only allowing the three new executive producers and co-hosts; Whoopi and newcomers Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace, to communicate with her and making it clear to everyone in earshot, she's literally running the show.

'She has a definitive view of how she would like the show to go and wants everyone else to fall in line,' said a show insider.

When Rosie and new co-host Nicole Wallace did a test show with two fill-in hosts in an effort to build chemistry. Neither Rosie Perez or Whoopi were present.

Despite the fact that Whoopi is the regular moderator for the show, leading the discussion, Rosie took charge of the test show with Nicole.

'It was almost as though she was rehearsing for when she eventually takes over as moderator. It's clear that she would have preferred being in that capacity as she was before,' offered the source.

Keeping her dukes up: Perhaps Whoopi was explaining the confrontation as she left ABC's studio on Monday

Nice shoes: The comedienne was wearing colourful strapped flat shoes as she got ready to head home

A whole lotta Rosie problems: No doubt working with the roly poly comic is one of the reasons the jolly star was looking so grumpy
