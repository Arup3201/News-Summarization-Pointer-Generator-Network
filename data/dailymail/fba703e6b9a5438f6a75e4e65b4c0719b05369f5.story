There was a close call between a military helicopter and a regional airliner attempting to land at Reagan National Airport near Washington last week, federal officials said today.

At their closest point, the two aircraft were flying at the same altitude and were only 950 feet apart laterally, said Eric Weiss, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident.

Republic Airlines flight 3281 had descended to 400 feet as it approached the airport when the helicopter, which had been flying lower and ahead of the plane, briefly rose to 400 feet as well, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement.

The passenger flight involved in the near-disaster was an Embraer 175. The pilot aborted the planned landing at Reagan National Airport to avoid a collision with a helicopter

That set off an alarm aboard the airliner warning of a potential impending collision, Weiss said. The airline pilot aborted the landing, circled around and landed safely. The incident occurred at 4:05 p.m. EDT on Friday, Weiss said.

NTSB identified the airliner as an Embraer 175, a twin-engine jet that generally seats about 80 people. The flight originated in Columbus, Ohio, and was destined for Huntsville, Alabama, with a stopover in Washington, Weiss said.

Weiss identified the helicopter as a Bell UH-1 based at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland using the call sign Mussel 9. The UH-1, also known as a Huey, has a single engine with a two-bladed main rotor and tail rotor.

The Air Force's 11th wing, based at Andrews, includes a UH-1 helicopter squadron. Andrews is the military's security base for the Washington area.

Warhorse: The Bell UH-1 helicopter involved in the incident was a model used during the Vietnam War

The FAA initially identified the helicopter as a UH-60, better known as a Black Hawk, but later confirmed it was actually UH-1.

In the United States, the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) has been collecting confidential voluntary reports of close calls from pilots, flight attendants, air traffic controllers since 1976.

The system was established after TWA Flight 514 crashed on approach to Dulles International Airport near Washington, DC, killing all 85 passengers and seven crew in 1974.

Some familiar safety rules, such as 
turning off electronic devices that can interfere with navigation 
equipment, are a result of this program.

According to a White House commission, due to near-miss observations and other technological improvements, the rate of fatal accidents has dropped about 65 per cent, to one fatal accident in about 4.5 million departures, from one in nearly 2 million in 1997.

The Federal Aviation Administration was formed in 1958 to oversee and regulate the airline industry and the use of U.S. airspace by both civilian and military aircraft following three mid-air collisions, two of which were between military and civilian aircraft. Prior to this, there was no unified control of airspace for civilian and military flights.

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the near-collision.Â
