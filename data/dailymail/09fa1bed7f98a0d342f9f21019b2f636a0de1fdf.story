Ginny the Jack Russell has more than 30,000 followers on Instagram seeking the latest updates on her life

Seven-year-old Ginny was rescued by her owner Chelsea Hope-England from a dog's home in Oxfordshire

The small dog suffered from a terrible skin condition which caused her to lose most of her fur

But life wasn’t always this good for the cute canine, who after being adopted from a local dogs home, suddenly developed a a severe skin allergy that caused her to lose most of her fur.

Luckily, Oxfordshire based owner Chelsea Hope-England recognised Ginny’s potential managed to nurse the dog back to health.

After coming across an Instagram account dedicated entirely to a small Malteste dog, Ms Hope was inspired to set up a page for her own beloved pet, but had no idea it would become so popular.

She said: 'Ginny likes sleeping and not wasting precious energy unless it’s to walk to her food bowl, so getting a photo is no problem at all.

'She also really loves the attention she gets after a photo has been taken so it’s easy for me to capture her shenanigans.

'Clothes don’t seem to bother her one bit, she’s always had clothes, because not long after I adopted Ginny she had a severe skin allergy and eczema, so she lost a lot of her fur and while we waited for it to grow back and for the medication to help her, she wore coats and jumpers so she didn’t get cold.

'She’s a bundle of lazy, although she can at times be energetic, always willing to eat and very happy 99 per cent of the time.'

Ms Hope-England said she opened up the Instagram account for Ginny after seeing another dog-based account

Ms Hope-England said: 'She’s happiest when she’s being hugged and for the other 1 per cent of the time she’s grumpy because I won’t let her have any more treats.

'I love to bath her, which is definitely not something Ginny likes, her fur gets so incredibly fluffy afterwards.

'About three years ago I found an account where she mostly posted photos of her adorable maltese dog, which inspired me to make an entire page for Ginny because I am obsessed with her and to be honest she has a far more interesting life than I do.

'The community on Instagram is amazing, Ginny regularly receives lovely letters, drawings, accessories, treats and was once even given a skateboard.

'I’ve kept it all and Ginny now has her own little shrine of herself close to her bed with drawings people have done for her.'
