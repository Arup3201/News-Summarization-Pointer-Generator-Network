Getting stuck in rush-hour traffic is enough to make anyone's blood boil.

But one driver was left 'seething' after being given a parking ticket for stopping at a bus stop while in a jam at a set of red lights.

Victor Hankins, 50, was issued with a £70 fine by a mobile camera car in Bradford, West Yorks, in December last year.

Victor Hawkins, 50, was left 'seething' after being photographed apparently stopping at a bus stop in December last year and issued with a £70 penalty notice by the local council

But Mr Hawkins was actually stuck in traffic at the time, which is allowed according to the Highway Code

Mr Hankins said: 'It was about 8pm and there was quite a bit of traffic on the road - it’s a main road and the traffic light was on red.

'I was about eight cars back from the traffic lights, and at the back of the bus stop - so there will be about three cars in front of me who received tickets too.

'The photograph showed my car in the bus stop - but it’s completely out of context, the photo doesn’t show that my car was in a long lane of traffic.

'I’d never park in a bus stop - on this road it would be stupid to do so, as it’s such a busy road and the traffic behind you would just be in chaos.'

After being given the notice Mr Hankins consulted the Highway Code, which states that drivers must not stop 'at or near a bus stop... except where forced to do so by stationary traffic' before contacting the council.

He added: 'They were as unhelpful as 
unhelpful can be. They told me to put my appeal in writing. I did that 
straight away, but after about eight or nine days I still hadn’t heard 
back, so I rung up again.

'It was then they told me they could send me the footage, so when I eventually saw it, I realised what had happened.

'I’m annoyed that it has taken so long. It’s just a money-making scam by the council.

'I
 was absolutely seething about what happened. It’s an absolute joke. The
 fact that the officer in the mobile car had given me a fine in the 
first place is ridiculous.

Mr Hawkins complained to the council, who asked for his appeal in writing, before admitting there had been 'a mistake' and withdrew the fine

Mr Hawkins branded the fine 'an absolute joke' and 'a money-making scam by the council'

'But there’s also the fact that two operators had viewed the footage and didn’t think it was worth mentioning that I wasn’t breaking the law.'

After reviewing the decision, the council has now dropped the charge and apologised, admitting that the notice was 'a mistake'.

In a statement, Bradford Council said: 'All images are checked before a Penalty Charge Notice is issued. In this case a mistake was made.

'When we find out that we have issued a penalty notice in error we cancel it and refund as appropriate.

'We continue to monitor and review performance regularly to ensure any errors are minimised.'

The news comes on the same day that it was revealed a London council made £1.6million from issuing 40,000 parking fines in ten streets last year.

Redbridge Council handed out 8,964 tickets in Cranbrook Road and raised £393,000 in fines, according to figures for last year released by the local authority.

Their second most profitable street - Clements Road - earned the council £251,000 from 4,600 parking fines - despite the street being just 540 yards long.

However Mr Hawkins challenged the decision, as stopping is permitted as long as you are prevented from moving by other traffic
