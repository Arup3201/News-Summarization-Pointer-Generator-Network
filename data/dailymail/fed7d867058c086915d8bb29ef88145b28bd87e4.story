A jobless couple with six children living on benefits have been given a spacious four-bedroom home after complaining their council flat was too small.

Maggie Flisher, 26, and her 30-year-old husband Gavin have not worked since 2005 and between them receive around £27,000-a-year in state benefits.

The couple had been living in a one-bed flat with their children - aged between three months and eight years old - for the past eight years.

But after years of complaining about the cramped conditions, a housing association has finally found them a larger house.

Packed in: Gavin and Maggie Flisher, had shared their one-bedroom flat with their six children Lacieann, eight, (centre, rear) Elektra, six, (far left) Gavin Jnr, five, (centre), Lilyrose, two, (right) and three-month-old twins Paris Nicola and Martinjames (front left and right)

Mrs Flisher said today: 'We are very pleased to be in.'

She added: 'I had to pay for the move myself, so it took us three weeks.'

Mrs Flisher claims she has been unable to 
work due to depression and mental health issues, while Gavin has 
to stay in their cramped home to look after her and their family.

The couple complained in July that Maidstone Borough Council in Kent had ignored their plea for a new home for eight years.

She explained she had six children, aged between eight and three months, because she is 'super-fertile' and contraceptive methods do not work for her.

Problem solved: Gavin with his daughters Elektra (left), Lacieann and his son Gavin Jnr in their one bedroom, which they have now moved out of

Complaint: The family said they had no room for their family. Gavin is shown here with Lacieann in their old cramped kitchen

Until this week, their three eldest children - Lacieann, eight, Elektra, six, and Gavin Jnr, five - all slept in the only bedroom.

Maggie and her two-year-old daughter Lilyrose slept on a sofa bed in the lounge alongside three-month-old twins Martinjames and Paris Nicola, who lay in Moses baskets.

Gavin slept wherever he could find a space.

But now, in their new Maidstone home, the parents have a room with their twins; daughters Elektra and Lilyrose share a room; and Lacieann and Gavin Junior each have their own room.

Complaints: The fertile pair say the pill, condoms, arm implants and an injection have all failed to stop them conceiving

No fun: The lack of space meant the family have had to pay for storage for belongings and toys

Costly: The family rely on a total of £27,000 in benefits paid out to them and their six children, who are all under the age of eight

A Maidstone Borough Council spokesman said he could not comment on any particular case.

He said : 'We maintain a housing register for homes offered by Kent Homechoice.

'People can apply. They bid for a house and some are successful. All our social housing is in short supply and there is only a small number of four-bedroom houses.'

In July, the family said they received an annual total of £22,900 in benefits, including £540 a month in jobseekers allowance; child benefit of £85 every week; and child tax credit of £1,000 a month.

They have also been receiving housing benefit of £270-a-month to pay the rent on their flat in the town.
