The Bureau of Meteorology has predicted an El Nino weather pattern to strike Australia this summer, with irregularly hot and dry weather on the horizon.

El Nino is a climatic event occurring roughly every five years, which is defined by substantial warming in temperatures of the Pacific Ocean sea surface.

In Australia, El Nino is characterised by droughts and abnormal heat, particularly in the eastern and coasts of the country, which are already on the grips of a dry spell.

This week, the Bureau has raised its prediction of an El Nino hitting this summer to 70 per cent, up from 50 per cent just two weeks ago.

Countries bordering on the Pacific Ocean who rely upon agriculture and fishing  are the most affected by El Nino.

When the conditions last for months, fishing industries can be severely damaged. The counterpart to El Nino, La Nina, sees temperatures cool to lower than average across the Pacific Ocean, increasing the risk of cyclones and landfalls around the Asia Pacific region.

Australia has already had two major heatwaves this spring, while sub-surface temperatures in the central to eastern areas of the Pacific are already 4 degrees warmer than average.

The event is largely triggered by changes in the Pacific Ocean.

'We're seeing very warm temperatures in the tropical pacific ocean, about 1 degree above average,' said Andrew Watkins, the bureau's manager of climate prediction service.

'Things seem to have evolved fairly quickly in the last few weeks,' 

 'What's happened is that things have continued to warm up in the tropical Pacific Ocean rather than stay stagnant, and the central tropical Pacific has reached temperatures that are basically at El Nino levels now.'

'This has a strong impact on temperature. October was 2.8 degrees above normal and very dry. We're seeing similar conditions across southeast Asia in Malaysia and Indonesia. Simultaneously, there are   floods happening in South America, which is the other side of the coin.'

The event is associated with very wet weather months in April–October along the coasts of Peru and Equador, giving rise to serious flooding. 

Mr Watkins says the Bureau used numerous approaches to reach the conclusion.

'There are  five international models which we have used  and they come from all over the world; France, England, America, Canada and Japan, plus our own model at the Bureau, which is called Poama.'

In its latest fortnightly El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Wrap-Up, the BoM has lifted its ENSO tracking status from 'watch' to 'alert'. 

'There is enough going on here that is sensible to raise the odds, raise the threat level, because we don't want people to go without the best information,'  

Mr Watkins said the last time we saw similar conditions in Australia was in  2012, and the conditions are looking to be more severe this year.

According to US weather agencies, 2014 has been the warmest ever April-September period, posing a serious threat that 2014 could be the hottest year on record.

At the moment, the warmest year is a tie between 2005 and 2010. 

Mr Watkins warned it can be difficult to classify the event conclusively.'The reality is that it's not like flicking a switch. El Nino is not a sudden change, but rather a gradual progression,' he said. 

'We are however seeing some telltale signs that these event will be reached by December.' 

Warmer Pacific temperatures combined with cooler seas around northern Australia mean there may be fewer tropical cyclones crossing the coast but also fewer tropical rain depressions relied upon by drought-affected farmers in Queensland, Dr Watkins said.

'They have already had a couple of bad wet seasons up there so a third one is not a good situation.'

In 2009/10 there were serious drought conditions across much of eastern Australia because of the El Nino effect.
