It has raked in a staggering £800,000 in fines in just six months and flashes an average of 71 motorists every single day - making this speed camera in Cardiff every driver's worst nightmare.

The device, located on Newport Road in the Welsh capital, has become the most lucrative speed camera in the UK and has already caught an astonishing 13,624 drivers this year.

The shady title was previously held by a camera at Junction 25 on the M60 in Greater Manchester which caught 26 speeding drivers per day.

'Cash cow': The hugely unpopular speed camera, on Newport Road in Cardiff, has raked in a staggering £800,000 in fines in just six months

Catching 71 motorists a day - the device in Wales almost trebles the total achieved by its predecessor.

The data comes from research conducted by LV insurance, who have also revealed that in 2013 speed cameras cost British motorists £22million in fines.

The new speed trap on a busy junction in Cardiff was at the centre of a storm yesterday - with drivers calling it 'nothing but a cash cow'.

Motorists have been left angered by the speed camera after road chiefs hailed it a massive success.

Mother-of-three Karen Leyshon, who was caught going at 34mph through the speed trap, said: 'It's is ridiculous - I've been driving on that road every days for years without any problem whatsoever until this camera was put up.

'It is nothing but a cash cow. It's outrageous, the camera does nothing to improve safety of this road. It may be a busy stretch but it's perfectly safe.

'I didn't notice the camera going up, I got caught doing 34mph and I had to pay £85 for a speed awareness course.

'It was a complete waste of my time and money - I'm sure that most of the other 13,000 people would tell you exactly the same thing.'

The camera has been in place since 2012 but it has only just became 'fully commissioned' catching thousands of motorists in the first six months of this year.

According to the latest statistics, the cameras generated 13,624 penalty notices for speeding and 146 for red-light offences.

And in February there were more than 100 tickets issued, on average, each day.

In the first half of the year 5,906 people completed speed awareness courses after being caught speeding at the junction. A further 3,064 people paid speeding fines in the same six months.

Figures show that with a minimum fine of £100 and a typical cost of £85 per place on speed awareness courses, the camera could have netted an astonishing £808,410.

Research by LV insurance has revealed that a speed camera installed on Newport Road in Cardiff has detected 13, 624 speeding drivers this year and raked in a staggering £800,000 in fines in six months.

Here are three other prolific UK speed cameras:

The GoSafe partnership, which operates Wales' road safety cameras, say the area has a high flow of traffic and motorists should always comply with the speed limit.

But road safety groups have said the camera is not doing it's job properly and should be there to reduce speeds rather than bring in money.

Tim Shallcross, from the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: 'The whole purpose of speed cameras is to slow people down, because it's felt that excessive speed in that area causes casualties.

'If a camera is issuing a small number of fines, or none at all, it's doing its job. If it's ticketing that many people, it's not having that effect.

'The local authority, which is responsible for road safety, should be looking at those figures and saying, 'We seem to have an issue here - the camera is catching a lot of people.

'Let's make sure that it looks like a 30mph highway, and that the cameras are clearly visible and the signs aren't obscured by vegetation'.'

A spokesman for Cardiff council said: 'The speed camera in question does not have advance signs in place alerting drivers, as this is not a legal requirement. Although this camera has been in place for some time, due to maintenance issues it has not been operational. The Council is alarmed at the number of tickets generated since the camera has been working and would urge drivers to reduce their speed for the safety of other road users, or face the consequences. The Council is committed to working with the South Wales Police through the GoSafe Partnership and speed cameras have and will continue to play an important role to improve road safety for those using Cardiff’s highways. A recent example is the 20mph zones which are operational in Cathays and Plasnewydd to improve public safety, encourage walking and alternate forms of transport.'
