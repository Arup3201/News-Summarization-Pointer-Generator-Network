Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said employers should try to hire a British worker first

British firms should ‘try one of our unemployed people first’ before looking to hire foreign workers, Iain Duncan Smith has claimed.

The Work and Pensions Secretary said more jobs were now going to people born in the UK after years of cheap labour from overseas undercutting Brits.

However, European law makes it illegal to discriminate against workers from elsewhere in the EU.

The number of UK-born workers in a job rose by 1.1 per cent in the last quarter of 2013, but among foreign-born workers it rose by 3.3 per cent to 4.45million.

Since January 2007, the number of UK-born workers in a job has risen by 1.1million but only 153,000 among Brits.

But Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘Now more jobs are going to British workers than went originally. So that is the beginning of a change, but I’m very keen to thrash that out so “try one of our unemployed people first before you go anywhere else”.’

He revealed his shock at the message people trying to find work near the London Olympics.

‘I was in a Job Centre at the time of the Olympics in my area of Waltham Forest. We were in the Olympic boroughs and there’s a big debate about how much work actually went to those boroughs,’ he told the House magazine.

‘I was talking to a plumber and a carpenter, trained, qualified individuals. And I asked them about the Olympic sites.

‘And they said: “They’re all or mostly people coming in from Eastern Europe who undercut us because they all hotbed in these areas and then they’re gone. I can’t compete with them on this because I’ve got a house, I’ve got kids, I’ve got commitments, there’s only so far I can go on salary, otherwise it’s worse for me than being on benefits”.’

But Tim Aker, Ukip's head of policy, said: 'If the government were serious about British jobs for British people, then why are they currently advertising nearly a million jobs on the EU's job mobility portal to workers from across the whole EU?

'The fact is that only Ukip will prioritise British workers for these jobs by pulling out of the EU and ending open border immigration.'

Earlier this month new Tory immigration minister James Brokenshire caused a storm when he claimed middle class families had enjoyed the benefits of cheap foreign labour, but the working classes had been squeezed out of jobs.

Mr Brokenwshire said: ‘For too long, the benefits of immigration went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour; or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services – but not to the ordinary, hard-working people of this country. We are changing that and building a system that benefits all.'

Since January 2007, the number of UK-born workers in a job has risen by 1.1million but only 153,000 among Brits

But the speech sparked a storm of controversy, when it emerged David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Home Secretary Theresa May had all hired foreign staff as cleaners or nannies.

Mr Duncan Smith defended Mr Brokenshire, adding: ‘He was saying the benefits of this, such as they are, tended to be in this group but not down at the bottom end, where they’ve tended to see the problem. He’s right in that by the way.

‘That is the issue. People that I deal with every day, they feel very squeezed by people who come in, under cut them in price.’
