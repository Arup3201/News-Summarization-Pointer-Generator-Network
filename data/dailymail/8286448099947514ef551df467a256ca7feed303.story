News that 19-year-old Hector Bellerin would make his full Arsenal debut in Dortmund was leaked by back-up goalkeeper Damian Martinez more than 90 minutes before the teams were formally submitted to UEFA. 

It was just after 5pm when Martinez told his 10,000 Twitter followers: 'All the best to my brother @hectorbellerin as he starts his first game for Arsenal #quality.' Arsene Wenger would probably have applied a different hashtag.

Handshakes and fist-bumps pre-match between Danny Welbeck and Shinji Kagawa. The last time they were involved in the Champions League they were starting in the same Manchester United team which lost 3-1 to Bayern Munich in April. The last time they were involved in a game together they lost 4-0 in Milton Keynes.

It may have been Liverpool’s return to Europe last night but Borussia Dortmund delivered a resounding pre-match rendition of 'You’ll Never Walk Alone'. Not quite Anfield but the Westfalenstadion bristled as 80,000 sang along and waved their giant yellow-and-black flags. This being Germany, they finished the Mersey anthem with a few bars of Van Halen’s Jump. And thus made it their own.

The new two-tone kit for officials in the Champions League had a strange effect. In the opening minutes, Arsenal players seem to confuse the muggy grey of referee Olegario Benquerenca with their own dark blue shirts. The pale grey shorts and socks helped.

Lukas Podolski was the only one of Arsenal’s German World Cup heroes to receive a rapturous welcome from the Dortmund crowd. He was warmly applauded onto the pitch in the 77th minute, by which time the game was won. The names of Mesut Ozil and Per Mertesacker were greeted with indifference when read out before kick-off.
