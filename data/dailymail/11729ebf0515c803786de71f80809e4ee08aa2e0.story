Not cooperative: Daisha Inman, seen here in a 2012 booking photo, refused to accept court papers from a process server

The mother of twin 15-year-old heirs to the Doris Duke fortune has been accused of using hired bodyguards and a 'SWAT team' to stop a bank from serving her with legal papers that demand she account for how she is spending their trust fund.

This is just the latest duel between JP Morgan, the administrator of the $29million trust fund left by the tobacco heiress, and Daisha Inman - the mother of Georgia and Walker Inman.

JP Morgan is holding the fortune in trust until the 15-year-old twins turn 21. The bank has for years battled with Daisha, claiming she is trying to 'drain' the trust fund with lavish spending - including $50,000 for Christmas gifts and $16million for a sprawling Utah estate.

According to court documents filed on June 20, process server Nik Coffen went to Inman's home in Park City, Utah, and attempted to serve her with legal papers on May 9, DNAinfo.com reports.

Georgia Noel Lahi Inman and Walker 
Patterson Inman III are the great-step-niece and nephew of heiress Doris Duke, once described as 'the richest girl in the world.'

Their father, Walker Inman Jr, who 
died in 2010 of a drug overdose, married Daisha, a former topless 
dancer, as his fourth wife.

The documentsthat JP Morgan sent were meant to legally notify Daisha that the bank was asking a Manhattan court to force Daisha to detail how she was spending the regular payment she was receiving from the twins' trust fund. The payments are meant to pay for the care and education of the teenagers.

At the Utah home, twin heirs answered the door and said their mother had left for several days with a 'friend.' They gave the process server Daisha's called phone number.

After two days of 'phone tag' Coffen 
got in touch with Diasha, who reportedly told the process server that 
she would not receive the court papers.

'She
told me that she would not be served and that her SWAT team and body 
guards would not let me anywhere near her,' Coffen wrote in a affidavit 
filed with the court after he tired and failed to deliver the documents 
for five days.

Finally, on May 14, Coffen went to the Inmans' Utah home again. This time he was blocked by a security guard.

After
Daisha refused to be served, with the papers, the court hearing went 
ahead as planned in Manhattan on June 28. She was not present.

In April, JPMorgan
filed court documents alleging that Randy Williams, 49, a convicted sex
offender who is dating Daisha Inman, has been working with her to drain
money from the trust fund.

The
bank accused Williams of using Daish'a email to ask for cash from the 
trust fund. He may also be behind unusual requests for money to pay for 
gold coins and a vacation to Las Vegas.

But
in court filings, JP Morgan says Mrs Inman has become 'erratic and 
hostile' and is making increasingly 'suspicious' requests to withdraw 
money from the fund, according to DNAInfo.com.

'Danger': The trust fund manager raised concerns about the twin's mother rekindling her relationship with Randy Williams, who has been accused of sexually abusing children

They say Inman, 54, has gotten back together with Williams, her ex-husband, despite his convictions for sexually abusing minors.

Williams has been convicted of 
molesting his step-daughters from a previous marriage and was barred 
from seeing his son after a court in Washington state found that he had 
sexually abused and neglected the child, according to Manhattan court 
filings by the JPMorgan administrator.

'At the most basic level, (JPMorgan)
is concerned about the potential risks to the children,' the trust 
administrator wrote, according to the New York Post.

Diasha and Williams agreed to split 
the 3percent commission that Williams would earn as the real estate 
broker for the sale, according to court documents.

As a result, the trust fund overseers went so far as to withhold the children's Christmas money.

'Concerned about Randy Williams' 
proximity to the children, his potential involvement in the children's 
financial affairs, and petitioner's continued difficulties with Ms. 
Inman - including Ms. Inman's failure to account for funds advanced to 
her - we determined in December 2012 that it would not transfer 
significant funds that had been approved for housing and holiday 
expenses to Ms. Inman's own bank account as it had done in the past,' 
the administrator wrote.

Instead, the bank set up separate funds that the children could access.

The administrator claims Williams selected the the $4.3million South Carolina mansion that 
Daisha asked the administrator to purchase. He chose the home, because 
'it was described in local media as the most expensive home on the Isle 
of Palm,' according to documents.

It was revealed last month that 
Daisha tried to buy a $29million mansion in Park City, Utah, with the 
trust fund - which would have depleted nearly half of her children's 
money.

'Instead of locating a suitable 
rental property as she had represented she would do, Ms. Inman requested
funding to buy a ranch in Utah with a listing price of $29million 
(representing almost the entirety of the property held in the children’s
trusts,' Francis Simms, a JPMorgan executor for the fund, wrote in a 
new court filing.

The 214-acre ranch boasted eight bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a tennis court, a movie theater and other luxury amenities.

'Shortly before she moved to Utah, 
Ms Inman made another premature request to fund the purchase of a 
relatively more modest $4.3million South Carolina residence, only to 
leave South Carolina without warning a few months later,' Simms wrote.

Inman blames JPMorgan for her 
family's financial difficulties, claiming their reluctance to repay 
legitimate expenses has resulted in the children being suspended from 
their private school. She has not commented on the latest claims about 
the Utah ranch.

Simms said the tuition wasn't paid 
because Inman failed to provide an itemized invoice verifying that the 
amount she asked for in tuition in fees was actually the amount that
was owed, according to the New York Post.

Ms Inman said she wanted to give her 
children a horse, a snowmobile and an around-the-world trip. The trust 
paid out $5,000 for Christmas instead.

'If the trustees simply funded all 
requests it received, the children’s trusts could be drained of assets 
long before the children ever reach the age of 21 years,' JPMorgan 
wrote.

But Ms Inman says the says the trustees have gone too far and neglected to pay her children's legitimate expenses.

The trustees have asked the court to intervene in the battle over twins' money.

Much like her descendants, Duke was unlucky in love. She is pictured here in 1935 with financier James Cromwell, the first of her two husbands

Walker and Georgia's father Walker 'Skipper' Inman Jr, died in 2010 of a methadone overdose.

Walker Jr's father was the half-brother of Doris Duke.

Doris Duke inherited untold millions 
from her father James 'Buck' Duke - the founder of American Tobacco, 
maker of Lucky Strike cigarettes.

His massive gift to a small, private 
college in North Carolina led leaders there to change its name to Duke 
University. The huge sum resulted in Duke becoming one of the most elite
universities in the country

Doris Duke, who died in 1993, left a 
large philanthropic legacy, as well. She was know during her time as 
'the richest girl in the world' and was a superstar celebrity and 
socialite for most of her life.

On her death, she left nearly all of 
her $1billon estate to the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, which 
remains a major force in the philanthropic world.

However, Doris Duke had no surviving 
biological children and part of the Duke fortune went into trust funds 
for the Inman twins.
