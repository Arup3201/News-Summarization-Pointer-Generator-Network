A Daytona Beach, Florida teen is causing strangers to freeze and stare because of her uncanny likeness to Queen Elsa from the Disney movie Frozen.

Anna Faith Carlson, 18, became an online sensation when she posted a picture of her posing next to a cardboard cutout of Elsa a few months ago.

She says she noticed the similarities between her and the Disney character when she first saw the film in December, calling the experience eerie.

The ice queen incarnate: Daytona Beach, Florida teen Anna Carlson looks exactly like Queen Elsa from the Disney movie Frozen

'It's a crazy resemblance,' Carlson told the Orlando Sentinel. 'Every time I watch [the movie], it's weird because it's like I'm watching myself. It's kind of creepy.'

But now she's using her storybook looks for good, dressing up as the character to entertain children and cheer-up cancer patients.

The aspiring actress is also hoping her online following will secure her an audition to appear on ABC show 'Once Upon A time' which is adding Elsa as a character next season.

In an interview with the Sentinel, Carlson recalls how she found internet fame by posting a picture next to a poster of Elsa she found at the mall.

Just graduated: Carlson, 18, currently works as a model in the Daytona Beach, Florida area 

'We had just finished a modeling job in Orlando and my mom and best friend wanted me to take a picture with the cutout,' Carlson said. 'My hair was up and I looked like a mess, so I didn't want to at first.'

However, when she posted the photo to her Instagram account, the image instantly went viral and now she receives fan mail every day, whether it be online comments, emails or sketches.

Since then, she's been marketing herself as a Disney dead-ringer, making appearances at schools and hospitals and even attending a prom dressed as Elsa.

Her real-life sister Lexie often accompanies her dressed as Elsa's sister Princess Anna from the movie, and her best friend steps in when Lexie isn't available.

'We of course do the appearances for free,' Carlson said. 'I just love seeing the kids and seeing them smile is so special.'

Some children have been brought to tears just because they believe Carlson is the real Elsa.

'It is all just so special. It's touching to bring life to a character in front of a child's eyes.'

The work suits Carlson who has been into singing and musical theater her whole life.

Right now, she's focusing on her modeling career, but also hopes to branch out into acting.

Carlson may have found the perfect opportunity as well since ABC show 'Once Upon A Time' ended it's current season with a teaser, hinting at an upcoming Elsa appearance.

Carlson's mother Karen says they've tried reaching out to ABC but 'haven't heard anything as of yet.'

She is currently asking her online followers to helped her get an audition by re-posting her picture.

Princess paycheck: Carlson hopes her status as a Disney doppelganger will land her an audition for ABC's 'Once Upon A Time' TV show, which will be adding Elsa as a character next season
