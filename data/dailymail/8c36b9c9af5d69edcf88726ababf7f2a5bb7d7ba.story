A drug dealer was jailed for three years today thanks to pictures he proudly took of himself kissing and counting his dirty money.

Gang member Peter Cavanagh, 26, delivered heroin and cocaine to the West Country as part of a mob that racked up profits of £30,000 a month.

He returned to London to spend his cash - getting out his mobile phone camera to take a quick 'selfie' clutching his earnings while on the train.

But two female dealers who were linked to the gang - led my Michael 'Flakey' Adegoke - were picked up by police in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, and linked to Adegoke and Cavanagh.

The addicts, Tracey Carter, 37, and Isabel Cristiano, 46, were caught with cocaine hidden in their underwear and private parts.

Cavanagh, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine at Bristol Crown Court.

The court heard that the gang distributed Class A drugs into Weston for two months in November last year.

Judge Julian Lambert said that though he acted under instruction from Adegoke, he was 'a highly trusted member of the group' and 'played a role in a highly corrosive trade that has undermined civilised society and ruined lives'.

Leader: Michael Adegoke, aka Flakey, was jailed for five years at an earlier hearing

At an earlier hearing in July all four
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine and all but 
Cavanagh were sentenced.

Adegoke, 21, of London was jailed for 
five years, while Carter and Cristiano, both from Weston-super-Mare, 
were given two-year suspended sentences.

Charles Thomas, prosecuting at an earlier court hearing, said: 'The drugs would be delivered from London to members of the conspiracy who lived in Weston.

'Once sold at street level, the profits generated would be returned to the suppliers in London, either in cash or by the money being paid into specific accounts.

'Adegoke was the leading figure of the conspiracy, giving orders and instructions to others involved and receiving much of the cash that was generated.

Guilty: Cavanagh will spend three years behind bars for dealing drugs

'Cavanagh's role was to act as a go-between from London to Weston and was the general factotum of Adegoke.

'He brought drugs to Weston and collected cash to take back to London and passed instructions to others.'

Nicolas Gerasimidis, defending Cavanagh, said his client had got involved in the drugs trade while trying to pay off debts his brother to Adegoke.

'He is a young man whose mind has changed away from criminality. Through sober reflection and understanding he has showed a determination to look the other way.'
