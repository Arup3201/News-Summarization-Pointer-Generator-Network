Until now she has appeared to defy all signs of ageing, despite a less-than-healthy fondness for parties and cigarettes.

But time may finally have begun to catch up with Kate Moss, who will turn 40 in January.

The supermodel, whose waif-like figure helped her rise to fame in the early 1990s, looked to have developed some curves as she sunbathed on a Mediterranean beach.

All change: Kate Moss looked curvier than her usual catwalk figure

Curvier: Kate Moss appeared relaxed as she took to the beach showing off a fuller figure than perhaps we are used to seeing

On holiday on the Spanish island of Formentera with her musician husband Jamie Hince, 44, and daughter Lila Grace, ten, she appeared relaxed as she frolicked in a black bandeau bikini.

And Miss Moss has plenty of reasons to look relaxed, after it emerged she made £12million from her businesses last year.

Earlier, Kate Moss looked practically Amazonian in a cheetah-print bikini and gold armband on her Spanish holiday.

Kate, 39, had taken off her sheer black and gold kaftan as she and Jamie Hince took her daughter on a boat trip with friends off the coast of Formentera.

With a beaming smile on her face, the model mother showed Lila Grace,11, how to do swim wear in style, and how to dive like a pro.

Walking towards the back of the yacht, Moss dove into the crisp blue water in from of the younger members of their party.

The other adults stayed on the boat, where Jamie, 44, looked a far cry from his usual rockstar in skinny jeans image, wearing cut-off denim jeans (from an old pair of skinnies?) with a matching shirt and slip on plimsolls.

The
 couple had arrived at the harbour in their car, but quickly decanted 
their belongings for the day trip with family friends and their 
children.

Kate's holiday comes just as it was revealed 
that she made a staggering £11.7 million over the last year.

The number was calculated from her earnings between the period of October 2011 to October 
2012, and shows that she raked in almost three times the amount she earned the previous 
year.

The Telegraph newspaper reports that 
figures filed at Companies House show her business Tilly Church posted 
profits of almost £8million, while her second company, Skate LLP, 
brought in £3.8million.

But
 that's not the only source of Kate's income, as the veteran model also 
has a number of lucrative deals, having been the face of Rimmel 
cosmetics for the past ten years.

Last
 year saw Moss create her own lipstick line for the London make-up brand and appear in the
 Olympics Closing Ceremony along with fellow models Naomi Campbell, Georgia-May Jagger and David Gandy.

She has also shot a number of high profile ad 
campaigns for high street retailer Mango, Rag & Bone and Dior Addict.

Happy girl: The model was having a fun time while in Spain with her friends and family

Hair up: Kate twisted her blonde locks back into a bus as she headed towards the speed boat

She's got the bill: No doubt Kate splashed the cash on the trip after raking in £11.7 million in earnings last year

And relax: Kate looked content as she carried her beach bag and strolled along with Jamie

But
 Kate's success doesn't end there,
 as her earnings this year are expected to far exceed that.

Thanks to 
her new accessories range for Carphone Warehouse not forgetting her 
upcoming campaigns for the likes of Versace, Givenchy, Matchless and St 
Tropez.

Puffing away: She showed she still has her vices as she smoked on a cigarette while driving a car around

With no real breaks in her over 
twenty year career, the mother-of-one
 is one of the rare models to have worked continuously in the fashion 
industry and is expected to continue into her 40s thanks to the strong
 brand she has build.

She 
first shot to fame with a topless Calvin Klein jeans advert when she was
 just 16 and is coming full circle in January by appearing topless on 
the cover of Playboy magazine's 60th anniversary edition.

Smoker: She's always been known as being a bit of a party animal who enjoys her cigarettes, and it seems she's still a cigarette fan

Still in good shape: While she may not be the figure of perfection she's always been, Kate certainly still looked stunning as she approaches 40 in January
