An interior designer who worked on a home renovation project for Mary Richardson Kennedy, has revealed how the late wife of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. instructed her to demand that contractors provide their services for free or at massively discounted rates.

Designer Robin Wilson was hired by Mary Richardson Kennedy when she was rebuilding the family's mold-infested 1920s house in Bedford, New York State, into a green showpiece home.

Wilson has told The New York Post, that part of her job with the Kennedys was to secure products and services for ‘free or as free as possible’ during the renovation project, which lasted from 2008 to 2010.

Builder Jim Blansfield, Robert Kennedy Jr., and Mary Richardson Kennedy showed off the finished home in 2010 just months before RFK Jr. filed for divorce

During the remodeling of the 
seven-bedroom mansion, the Kennedys amassed more than $1.3 million in 
free products including high-end appliances, dual flush toilets, solid 
brass and zinc faucets, hardwood flooring, and hypoallergenic rugs. In 
addition, the family used their influence to secure massive discounts 
from the builder and other contractors.

Builder
Jim Blansfield, who led the two-year construction project, said he 
charged 'very, very much less than what I would normally charge. I felt 
the project had great merit.'

However his work on the house did not lead to an increase in business.

Many contractors were promised free publicity and credit in a television show for NBC, which never aired.

The
kitchen was designed free-of-charge, and the craftsman who did the 
bookcases and fireplace mantels charged half his usual rate.

Energy-efficient
windows were provided by a local distributor for a Minnesota company, 
Marvin Windows and Doors, at a discount of more than $100,000.

But Richardson called Sen. Al Franken, a
Minnesota Democrat and an ally of her husband, and asked him to force 
the company to donate the windows.

‘Mary reached out to many people and corporations, including Al Franken,’ Wilson told The New York Post. A spokesman for Franken denied the claim.

Other contractors have claimed at 
Robin Wilson is reputed to have told the contractors that they wouldn't 
receive any credit for their work if they didn't donate the windows for 
free.

Despite the hard 
sell, the window distributor refused to budge and the Kennedys paid 
$230,000 for the windows, which had a retail price of $350,000.

Wilson too was eventually a victim of
the Kennedy family, she was fired by Mary Richardson Kennedy just as 
the project was finishing and was paid only a fraction of her final 
bill.

RFK Jr. put the house
on the market last month for $3.9 million - five months after his 
estranged wife committed suicide on the property.

Mary
Richardson Kennedy hung herself in a barn on the 10-acre property in 
May as the pair were locked in a bitter divorce and custody battle.

Stunning: The house is filled with light

Sprawling: The estate was put on the market for almost $4 million

Crumbling: By the time their million dollar home renovation was complete Mary Richardson was getting divorced from RFK Jr.

He and his first wife had bought the original 1920 clapboard farmhouse on the site for $745,000 in 1985. He stayed in the house with second wife Mary Richardson in 1994 and they raised their children there until a storm flooded it in 2003.

The massive water damage left the home mold-infested and uninhabitable, so the couple outlined a plan to raze and rebuild the property promising contractors and vendors free publicity for working on the high-profile renovation.

Not long after the home was completed, RFK Jr. filed for divorce and then moved out.
