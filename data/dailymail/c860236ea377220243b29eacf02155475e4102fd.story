Architect Phil Jones, 68, who was left unable to speak, read or write following a stroke, has learned how to communicate by drawing plans of houses

An architect who was paralysed by a stroke has learned to communicate again in the only way he can remember - by drawing plans of houses.

Phil Jones, 68, from Penzance, was left unable to speak, read or write and also lost movement down his right hand side following the brain haemorrhage - which led to the stroke - in 2005.

But he has since developed a unique method of interacting with his wife Deana using the architect's eye that he developed during his career.

Right-handed Mr Jones uses his left hand to drawn plans of their home to get his point across and direct his wife to what he needs.

If Mr Jones wants some fruit from the kitchen he starts by drawing a plan of his house, working down towards the kitchen where the fruit bowl is.

And if he wants to go outside, he will draw an image of the couple's garden, using a series of lines.

Mrs Jones, 56, says it can take all day to work out what he wants and that it recently took from the morning to the evening to discover he wanted a banana.

His wife says simple conversations can last all day, but that she has been amazed at what her husband has been able to achieve.

She said: 'When he had his stroke he was also hit with aphasia, a condition that affects a person's ability to speak, read, or write. He now has to draw with his left hand.

'But it didn't take away his ability to see things as architects do, that bird's eye view.

'If, for example, Phil wants some fruit, it would be too hard for him to just draw this because of the aphasia so he would draw a map of the house and focus on the kitchen and work down through the drawn plans to the core of what he wants.

'We might start a conversation in the morning and not finish until later in the day because it is hard work to know what he is saying, but we stick with it.'

She added: 'He loves to be out in the garden and will also draw the plan of that when he wants to go there.

'He still has the architect's eye when he is out there as well, although he cannot do any of the physical work.

'It has been life changing. We are so lucky that his career before his stroke was what it was. He loved it and it is what is helping him live a better life. 

The couple only met one year before Mr Jones's stroke, which left the then fit and active 58-year-old in hospital for six months.

Mrs Jones said: 'I am so proud of Phil. We met dancing, which he can't do any more but he still loves music.

'This is just the life journey that we are on. It is different from where we started but there is always a way forward.' 

Mr Jones worked as an architect for 35 years in the Bristol branch of real estate company King Sturge.

His job involved drawing up plans for colleges, schools, warehouses, homes and offices, for projects all over the UK.

The couple married 18 months after Mr Jones's stroke. They have no children but Mrs Jones has four from a previous marriage and one grandchild.

Despite his dehibilitating stroke ten years ago, Mr Jones can now draw a series of simple sketches 

She said: 'Although he has to do the drawings with his left hand, you can still see the architect plans in everything he does.

'I don't have any real knowledge of buildings - but that is the language he talks so we have made it work.

'His language is extremely limited. It can be very difficult - a bit like the Guess Who game at times.' 

Talking about the stroke, Mrs Jones said: 'Our lives changed overnight. He was on the floor in the bedroom and had been there for 12 hours before an ambulance got to him. That was why he was so badly affected as there was no early intervention.

'Phil had no communication at all. He lost every form of understanding. He could not walk, talk or move.

'He was in hospital for six months and even when he came home communication was virtually impossible.

'I initially tried all sorts of different programmes as I had worked in schools for children with disabilities. But nothing worked. It was all down to how Phil's brain was switched on.

'Communicating through the drawings just evolved I guess. It was probably about three years after his stroke that we discovered it. He had to learn to wash, shave and do every basic thing again.

'It was like he was a new-born. But we got to the point where we developed an understanding of how to communicate with sketches.  

'I think he had been trying to do it for a while. But my acceptance of it was the big breakthrough. He had retained his skills as an architect. It was such a part of him that he never lost it.' 

Victoria Sadler from the charity Connect that supports stroke and aphasia sufferers, said Mr Jones's achievements were remarkable.

She said: 'People with aphasia have full comprehension but can't communicate, which is very frustrating and isolating.

'Phil communicates beautifully by drawing pictures, the most beautiful and precise pictures. His achievements are mammoth and we are all very proud of him.'
