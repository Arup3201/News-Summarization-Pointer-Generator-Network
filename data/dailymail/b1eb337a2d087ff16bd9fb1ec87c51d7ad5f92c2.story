A mammoth fund worth £20 a year for every adult and child in the UK should be set up to encourage cycling, the Liberal Democrats say.

The latest idea from the junior Coalition party would cost the taxpayer more than £1.2billion a year at a time when public spending needs to be cut to help bring down the deficit.

It would also give cycling as much public money as some entire departments in Whitehall.

Healthy plans: The proposed budget would see £20-a-year spent on each UK citizen to encourage cycling

However, the party will discuss plans for a ‘cycling budget’ at its conference next month after they were proposed by Cambridge MP Julian Huppert.

Critics will point out that the scheme is traditional Lib Dem posturing that will make very little difference to efforts to encourage more people into the saddle.

George Eustice, Conservative MP for Camborne and Redruth, said: ‘Getting people cycling is important, but I don’t think this policy would work.

'It would mean an unfunded cost of over £1.2billion, which would simply lead to more borrowing and more debt.’

Tory backbenchers will see the plans as merely the latest in what has been called the Lib Dems’ ‘war on the motorist’.

Other proposals to be discussed at the party’s conference include automatically blaming drivers for all accidents involving cyclists using a legal system of ‘proportionate liability’.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s party also wants to ban all petrol and diesel cars by 2040.

Their ‘cycling budget’ motion would see the creation of a budget worth £10 per person, increasing later to £20 a head.

The most recent official estimates put the UK population at 63.2million. So at £20 per person, Mr Huppert’s scheme would cost £1.26billion per year – the equivalent cost of 41,489 soldiers.

Funding the cycling policy would mean slashing the total number of Army personnel in half.

It is also the equivalent cost of taking 31,752 policemen off the streets, 48,672 nurses out of hospital wards, or removing 39,371 teachers from schools.

The budget’s size is also comparable with some government departments.

In 2014/15, the amount of taxpayers’ money allocated to the Foreign Office is expected to be about £1.35billion.

The Lib Dem’s spending proposals do not stop there.

Mr Huppert’s motion also calls for an increase in the ‘local sustainable transport fund’, better integration of the  cycle network and the creation of more cycle paths.
