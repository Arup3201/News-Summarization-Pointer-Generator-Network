A chilli sauce company has been under attack on social media after labelling prime minister Tony Abbott an 'idiot' on their product.

Darwin Chilli Co has triggered an online storm after a photograph of a 'Darwin Hot Sauce' bottle label was shared across Twitter and Facebook, which also drove the company's Facebook page to 72,000 percent in traffic.

The label reads: 'Darwin hot sauce (sriracha style) is what it is. We are sorry that our Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, is an idiot. Heat level: Cat3.'

The sauce company has come under attack for calling the Prime Minister an 'idiot' on its' chilli sauce bottles

The family-owned business started the labels shortly before Abbott was elected prime minister around September 2014.

The company owner, who wished to not be named, told Daily Mail Australia the idea came to light from an 'old school labelling joke that started in France from the 1980s'.

'A french clothing company wrote under their washing instructions that they were sorry that their president was an idiot. It's funny and I've always remembered that.

'When I was making my labels, I remember hearing Tony Abbott's name everywhere so I made the first label as "Don't vote for Tony Abbott, he's an idiot", he said.

'But then he got elected so we had to apologise in the labels for our next batch of chilli sauces.'

The Darwin based family-owned business has been making and selling chilli sauce during the past five years

The page has been backfired with negative comments after discovering the printed label on the bottle

He said the label is 'just a bit of a joke' and 'nearly everyone gets it' but it has offended a few over social media and has attracted a significant amount of 'internet trolls'.

'The negative comments don't bother us - it's just a sense of humour and we think it's hilarious.

'No one cares except the internet trolls who go on our page and give us one star ratings and abuse.

'But the negative stuff has actually kicked off our business and everybody is behind us. We couldn't be prouder. We started off defending ourselves but we've had so many nice people supporting us.

'We even had to shut down our official website because we ran out of stock.'

The business owner said the label started during the election, before Abbott was appointed prime minister

The business has received a significant amount of supporters since the label was shared over social media

The family from Darwin has been making chilli sauces for the past five years.

'Our main focus is let our sauces do all the talking. It's 100 percent Australian made and every ingredient, down to the garlic is all from Australia.

'We just like chilli sauce and it's just what we do and sell at markets. The label was always written behind the bottles and it makes our customers read it and go "hang on".

The business is currently closed for business but will reopen second week of January. 

'We're looking at making a couple of ton next year and people are already placing their orders. We'll be sending out the first batch of sauces early next year so get in quick.'

Despite the negative backlash on social media, the owner said the company will continue to run their 'Tony Abbott' labels.

'By popular demand, our Tony Abbott labelled sauce will be available for backorder,' he said.

He added: 'To all the internet trolls, Merry Christmas and come say hi to us when you're in Darwin.'
