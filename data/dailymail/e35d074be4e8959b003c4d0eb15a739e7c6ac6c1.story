It was the day that signalled the end of six years of bitter fighting, countless deaths, and heralded an Allied victory.

So it's little wonder that impromptu parties and celebrations broke out across the US and Britain.

August 14 1945, now known as Victory in Japan Day, saw the unconditional surrender of Japan and the end of World War Two.

Now, restored video footage shows sailors and soldiers taking to the streets of Honolulu, Hawaii, to cheer the Allied victory.

Celebrations: US Navy personnel pack onto a car an punch the air with delight as they celebrate the end of World War Two

Relief: Delighted men and women wave at bystanders as they drive up and down the beachfront and honk their horns in delight

The end of the war: VJ Day was declared a two day holiday in the US, Britain and Australia as celebrations broke out to mark the Japanese surrender

Entertainment: A marching band takes to the streets to celebrate after days of rumours and speculation that the war was coming to an end

The poignant footage shows men in navy uniforms and their counterparts from the US Army packed on to cars and trucks punching the air and whooping with delight, honking their horns and waving at bystanders as they drive along the streets.

Many of the military personnel are seen waving American flags and a ticker tape parade rains down on the streets and people drink and clink bottles in satisfied celebration.

A marching band is also seen parading on the Honolulu streets while reunited couples look delighted to see each other again.

The sunkissed scenes were a far cry from the scene in London, where thousands of Britons braved the rain to see King George VI parade down The Mall in an open top car or in Washington, where crowds gathered to hear President Truman's speech.

Reunited: It's a wonder that the driver of this car can see as a couple sit on the roof while he drives in Honolulu

Happy: This delighted group are seen in the footage playing up for the camera

The moving footage ends with the tagline: 'None of us would be here today if not for you.'

The celebrations and the Japanese surrender was particularly poignant in Hawaii, as Pearl Harbour on the island had been the scene of a catastrophic attack by 353 Japanese fighter planes in December 1941 - the trigger for the US to join World War Two.

Some 2,402 Americans were killed in that attack.

The Japanese government finally agreed to the terms of the Potsdam agreement which called for the unconditional surrender of the east Asian country just days after the US had dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima on August 6 and Nagasaki on August 9.

Parade: Ticker tape litters the streets of Honolulu as the part begins

Cheers: This man is seen toasting victory in Japan with a friend

All smiles: The relief and happiness is etched all over these two military men on VJ Day

Delight: This pair play around with the local flora in a bid to brighten up the celebrations

Japanese Emperor Hirohito had said: 'Should we continue to fight, it would not only result in the ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation but would lead also to the total extinction of human civilisation.'

The Germans had of course surrendered in May.

VJ Day was marked by a two day holiday in the US, the UK and Australia.

Although VJ was celebrated in mid August, the Japanese didn't officially sign a surrender until September 2.

Romantic view: This couple look ahead to the future now that the war has finally ended
