The 50-year-old victim was stabbed in his back during a fight with two other men at around 10 a.m. Tuesday on Sutphin Boulevard in Queens, New York, before he managed to walk a block to the fast food restaurant.

‘I heard everybody screaming and it was a lot of commotion,’ witness Tromaine Yancey told CBS. ‘The guy came and he was standing there with a knife in his back and it was a kitchen knife.’

Shocked customers ditched their food to help make sure the victim didn’t fall onto his back until emergency responders arrived.

‘He was on the phone, I’m pretty sure he was on the phone talking to somebody in his family or a loved one, he was talking to them and telling them it might be the last time he’s speaking to them,’ added Yancey.

The man was rushed to Jamaica Hospital and police have described his condition as serious but stable. Police are looking to speak to two men who fled the scene after arguing with the victim.
