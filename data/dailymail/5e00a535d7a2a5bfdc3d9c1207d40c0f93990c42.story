A California town has passed a smoking ban that city officials are calling the most stringent in the country.

The San Francisco town of San Rafael, a community of about 57,000 people, passed the ban, which prohibits lighting up in all duplex and multi-family residential units that share a common wall.

The law applies to both renters and owners and includes residences such as condos, co-ops, apartmentrs and any residence with three or more units.

Smoking ban: Residents in San Rafael, California cannot smoke in their own homes if they share a common wall with other residences

'We are happy to blaze a trail,' Mayor Gary Phillips said before the vote.

'We're most happy to be in the forefront of the issue because we think it will greatly benefit our residents and those visiting San Rafael, and we think it will set the tone for other cities as well.'

The ordinance also made it illegal to smoke outside in downtown San Rafael unless the smoker is 'actively passing' on their way somewhere else.

Smoking in parks and recreation areas, outdoor dining areas and in service areas (ATMs, bus stops) is also prohibited.

Pam Granger, advocacy manager for the American Lung Association in California told NBC that San Rafael is the state's ninth municipality to completely restrict smoking in multi-unit housing.

In 1977, nearby Berkley became the first city in the world to restrict smoking in restaurants.

Regulations: Critics of the new rules say the government should not be able to dictate if people smoke inside their own homes

Rebecca Woodbury told ABC News that the studies show secondhand smoke can seep in through ventilation ducts and walls.

According to a 2006 Surgeon General's report, secondhand smoke kills an estimated 50,000 Americans each year.

Asked if there was opposition to the ordinance, Woodbury said there was hardly any. 'We have a very low percentage of smokers in the county,' she said.

Some though, believe the government should not be able to dictate whether or not people smoke in their own homes.

Smoke-free town: Other prohibitions include smoking in San Rafael's downtown area, smoking in parks and smoking in outdoor eating areas

'This proposed smoking ban actually intends to punish people for what they do in their own homes,' Thomas Ruppenthal told the council.

'I really feel this is tyranny.'

George Koodray called San Rafael's new ruling 'mischevious.'

'I don't believe it's rooted in science,' Koodray, who is president of the Metropolitan Society, a group of New Jersey cigar smokers, told ABC News.

'Someone smoking in a sealed apartment endangers the health of others in the building? The science for that is spurious at best.'
