A retired engineer and his wife have been savagely beaten in their home by intruders five years after moving to Australia.

Ken Ainscough, 76, was hit on the head, resulting in bleeding on the brain, while his wife Rosalind, 71, is being treated for a fractured skull, and both are now receiving round-the-clock medical care.

Two men are believed to have smashed their way into the couple's two-storey home in a wealthy suburb of Adelaide.

The couple have lived in the house for the last five years after moving there from Blackburn, Lancashire, to be closer to their daughter, Lisa.

She said: ‘They were due to receive Australian citizenship soon, but they’ve been left traumatised by this.

‘It
 is just absolutely terrible. There’s no way you should attack old 
people,’ she told Channel 10 news as she stood outside the couple’s 
house. ‘They were just in their own home.

‘My
 father tried to hold the door shut to stop them coming at them because 
he saw them. They just barged in and attacked them over the head.

‘They are old people and they did not need to hit them over the head like that. They could have just pushed them to the side.’

She said that despite their injuries, her parents remembered details of the attack vividly.

Her mother, she said, was ‘feeling terrible this morning – worse than yesterday.

'She is just sick and suffering from nausea and she can’t get out of bed as she can’t walk.’

A fresh start: The couple sold their multi-million pound scuba diving business in Blackburn, Lancashire, pictured, to start a new life in Australia

Police Inspector Tim Scammell of 
Adelaide police said one of the men was armed with a long knife while 
the other was believed to have had a sawn-off shotgun.

The
 couple were believed to be wealthy, Mr Ainscough selling his 
multi-million pound scuba diving equipment business in Blackburn before 
he and his wife emigrated to Australia.

They
 purchased their home in the district of Burnside in 2004 and, said 
their daughter Lisa, looked forward to a happy retirement.

But their dreams were smashed when their dog began to bark at 12.30am, warning that intruders had got in.

Lisa
 said her father tried to hold the door of their bedroom closed, but the
 men forced it open and he was hit over the head, falling to the ground.

When
 his wife tried to help him, she was also attacked. They managed to 
raise the alarm and were rushed to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for 
emergency treatment.

Inspector Scammell described the attack as a ‘particularly violent and senseless act’, especially as the assailants, believed to be in their 20s, escaped with only a small amount of money.’

It comes as a former air ambulance boss has been killed in a road crash in Australia - just weeks after emigrating Down Under.

Harold Chapman was former chairman of the Cornwall Air Ambulance Trust.

His wife Pamela, who was also a trustee of the charity, was seriously injured in the accident.

Grandfather Mr Chapman had served on the board for 15 years and only stepped down in August to start a new life in Australia to be nearer family members.
