To underline the quality of the Bayern Munich side, six of their line-up were World Cup winners.

Xabi Alonso, a 2010 champion with Spain, supplemented German club-mates Manuel Neuer, Philipp Lahm, Jerome Boateng, Mario Gotze and Thomas Muller who triumphed in Brazil last summer.

City defender Martin Demichelis will remember them, he was part of the Argentine side that lost in the final, as was sub Sergio Aguero.

He may no longer be in situ but this is the sort of week former City Chief Executive Garry Cook dreamed of when he put up provocative 'Welcome to Manchester posters' and claimed they would be the biggest team in the world. 

While City went toe-to-toe with mighty Bayern, Wayne Rooney and his United team-mates were on a team-bonding night out in a Manchester restaurant this week, jealously looking out at all the Champions League participants.

Manchester City have recently signed up all their big-name stars on long-term contracts - except Joe Hart. But England's No1 can't have done his negotiating position any harm with a performance that suggested he's back to his very best. 

Two saves in particular from Thomas Muller and Mario Gotze were world-class. Quite a difference from a year ago when he was blamed for City's home defeat against the same opposition and dropped soon after. 

Joe Hart performed admirably against Bayern Munich, pulling off a string of impressive saves 

Manuel Pellegrini, serving his last game of a touchline ban, watched on from the posh seats in the Allianz Arena next to Academy Director Brian Marwood, without the help of an abacus. 

Last season the Chilean suffered his most embarrassing moment as City manager in Munich when he confessed he hadn't realised a 4-2 City win would have left them as group winners to avoid a knockout tie against Barcelona, At 3-2 up, Pellegrini made a defensive substitution by sending on Jack Rodwell for Edin Dzeko.

City's executives Txiki Begiristain and Ferran Soriano are unabashed Pep Guardiola fans, keeping a close eye on his tactics and dreaming he may one day be lured to The Etihad. 

It was interesting to see how Guardiola has developed from his Barcelona days. Robert Lewandowski led the line instead of a false number nine and Louis van Gaal would kill for wing-backs like Rafinha and Juan Bernat.

For all the quality on show, there was a fair amount of rough-and-tumble too. Thomas Muller was physically fended off by Bacary Sagna in the first minute, Edin Dzeko hurt his back as things got fierce in the trenches. 

If it sets a Champions League trend, how much will City regret sending their "Beast" Alvaro Negredo out on loan to comply with FPP regulations and an enforced Champions League squad. 

Manchester City and Bayern Munich are full of quality, but physicality played a significant role in the match
