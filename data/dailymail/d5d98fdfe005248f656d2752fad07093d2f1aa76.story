Laboratory work may not seem glamorous, but scientists in these isolated hubs have access to some of the most spectacular sights in nature.

These images, compiled by  GE Healthcare Life Sciences as part of an annual competition, reveal the beautiful views scientists see as they peer into the microscope.

They highlight intricate patterns in tiny creatures such as mice and fruit fly that are also seen in various parts of the human body.

Vanessa Auld from Canada took first place with this image of Drosophila neuromuscular system in the microscopy category. Drosophila is a group of small flies, belonging to the family Drosophilidae, whose members are often called fruit flies

As well as being visually stunning, these images have helped cellular biologists from around the world uncover new treatments for diseases.

The global imaging company has announced the winners of the competition as Vanessa Auld from Canada, Martin Barr from Ireland and Graham Wright from Singapore.

With over 23,000 votes cast by the public, their images will be used to light up Times Square  in New York between 25-27 April.

Pictured here are lung cancer cells with the blue stained areas showing DNA. Lung cancer is one of the most common and serious types of cancer. There are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages

A microscopic close up of fruit fly larvae. When fully grown, fruit flies are typically pale yellow to reddish brown to black, with red eyes. Many species have distinct black patterns on the wings and are about 2-4 millimetres long

Highlights include an image of a
 ‘spine ganglion’. This is a nodule on a dorsal root of the spine that 
contains nerve cells that carry signals from the body's 
organs to the brain.

 are typically pale yellow to reddish brown to black, with red eyes.

As
 well as showing the larvae, Vanessa Auld from Canada took first place 
with a stunning image of the neuromuscular system of a fruit fly.

This year's competition attracted over 100 entries from scientists who are using either high-content analysis or high- and super resolution microscopy. Pictured here are human bronchial epithelial cells stained showing DNA in blue

Beautiful yet beastly: Trypanosoma brucei (pictured right) is a species of salivary parasite which causes African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness. Lung adenocarcinoma (pictured left) which is a form of lung cancer

Pictured here are neurons in the brain of a mouse. Images such as this could help researchers understand how conditions develop in illnesses such as Alzheimer's

Mouse spermatocyte are pictured here. These will give rise to rise to sperm cells. This image by Graham Wright, Institute of Medical Biology, was a regional winner in the microscopy category

This
 year’s competition attracted over 100 entries from scientists who are 
using either high-content analysis or high- and super resolution 
microscopy.

Their images 
investigate at the cellular level a wide variety of diseases such as 
cancer, muscle disease and the effects of parasitic infections.

‘This
 year’s three winning images are once again incredibly beautiful and 
compelling, reminding us of the cellular complexity behind disease and 
why the study of cells is so important,’ said Eric Roman, general 
manager of Research and Applied Markets, GE Healthcare Life Sciences.

‘We
 were delighted to receive so many outstanding entries to the 
competition, which highlights how cell imaging is helping scientists 
explore the universe of the cell and is advancing our understanding of 
so many life-threatening and life-limiting diseases.’

The optic stalk of a fruit fly is seen here. The stalk is one of a pair of slender embryonic structures that becomes the optic nerve in the eye

Pictured is a spine ganglion. This is a nodule on a dorsal root of the spine that contains cell bodies of nerve cells (neurons) that carry signals from the body's organs
