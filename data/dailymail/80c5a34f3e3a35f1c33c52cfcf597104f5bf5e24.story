Following Kate Moss's revelations that she suffered a near nervous breakdown as a teenager after being pushed into posing topless, another top model has expressed her own concerns.

Supermodel Heidi Klum may have made a name for herself by posing half naked on the cover of Sports Illustrated naked on the cover of GQ and as a lingerie-clad Victoria's Secret Angel.

But she insists young models should say no to posing nude.

Speaking to Ocean Drive in their 20th anniversary issue, the 39-year-old revealed how over the years she has learned to toe the line between tasteful and obscene at a very young age and says young girls have to remain strong.

Game changer: Heidi Klum rose to fame as the the bikini-clad (and first German) cover star of Sports Illustrated in 1998, left, and has posed nearly-naked many times - but says girls should think twice before posing nude

She said: 'When you have a good body, 
photographers will often be like, "Yeah, let’s take this off, and why 
don’t we lose this too," and you can quickly end up not wearing much 
clothing.

'You have to be careful and strong at saying no, especially 
when you’re younger and on your own. Not everyone is cool and has your 
best interest [at heart].'

Baring all: The German supermodel is no stranger to posing half naked and has also graced the Victoria's Secret catwalk

The German-born beauty also opened up about her favourite photographer Rankin, who has captured her in a variety of poses.

The mother-of-four said: 'But Rankin has always made sure, when some of 
my shoots would be more on the naked side, that they wouldn’t look 
raunchy. They were sexy, yes, but very classy.'

In fact, Rankin shot the very cover shot of her in a fitted, one-shoulder black dress for Ocean Drive's anniversary issue.

What's certain is that Heidi has 
forged an extremely successful career for herself. In May 2011, Forbes 
magazine estimated her total earnings for that year as $20 million.

She is ranked second on Forbes' list of the 'World's Top-Earning Models', behind Gisele Bündchen.
