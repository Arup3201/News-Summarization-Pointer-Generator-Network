Jose Mourinho has criticised the culture of modern-day footballers and has revealed his Real Madrid stars queued in front of the mirror before a match.

The Chelsea boss says aspiring players of today want to make millions before they have even kicked a ball in the Premier League.

Instead, he wishes youngsters would follow the example of Frank Lampard and John Terry, who he says were ‘fanatical for victories’.

In an interview with Esquire magazine,
 Mourinho bemoaned the thirst for wealth and celebrity in the game, and 
outed his Real players - which included the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo 
and Sergio Ramos - over their vanity.

‘Lots of times at Real Madrid, the 
players would be queuing in front of the mirror before the game while 
the referee waited for them in the tunnel,' he said.

‘But
 that’s how society is now. Young people care a lot about this: they are
 twenty-something and I am 51 and if I want to work with kids I have to 
understand their world.

‘How
 can I stop my players on the bus doing, er, what do you call? Twitters 
and these things? How can I stop them if my daughter and my son do the 
same? So, I have to adapt to the moment.’

And, of the premature desire for wealth which Mourinho feels is plaguing the sport, he added: ‘What I feel is that before, players 
were trying to make money during their career, be rich at the end of 
their career.

‘But in this moment, the people who surround them try to make them rich before they start their career.

‘They try to make them rich when they sign their first contract, when they didn’t play one single match in the Premier League, when they don’t know what it is to play in the Champions League.’

Mourinho favourite Terry was a graduate of the academy 
system at Chelsea, while Lampard was bought for £11m having come through
 the ranks at West Ham.

Both have been regulars for club and country over the past decade and are now enjoying a new lease of life with Mourinho back at Stamford Bridge.

They
 won their first Premier League trophy under the Portuguese in 2005, and
 are currently part of a Chelsea side four points clear at the top of 
the table.

And Mourinho went on: ‘You have to find the right boy: the boy who wants to succeed, his pride and passion for the game.

‘His dream is not one more million or one less million, his dream is to play at the highest level, to win titles, because if you do these things you’ll be rich the same at the end of your career.

‘So we are working hard to give the best orientation to young players, to follow examples of guys from the past – the Lampards, the Terrys – who were always fanatical for victories’.
