The husband of Melbourne's Jill Meagher, who was raped and murdered two years ago, is urging his Facebook followers to stop 'pick-up artist' Julian Blanc obtaining an Irish visa.

Tom Meagher took to social media and asked people to sign a change.org petition to stop Ireland from being a 'haven' for Mr Blanc.

'Mr Blanc promotes sexual assault, and harassment as part of his shtick as a "pick-up artist",' Mr Meagher posted along with the petition's link.

'He has had to leave Australia due to a campaign forcing him out and has recently been denied visas in Canada and the U.K..'

Mr Meagher's wife, Jill, was raped and murdered in 2012 while walking home less than 500 metres from a bar in Brunswick, in Melbourne's inner city.

Her disappearance sparked a widespread social media campaign to find her and her killer. 

Mr Blanc has caused controversy over his pick-up techniques which include choking women and then shushing them

Mr Meagher's appeal comes after Victoria's police commissioner Ken Lay condemned Mr Blanc in an address on family violence at state parliament.

Mr Lay likened Mr Blanc's pick-up techniques, which include choking women and then shushing them, to family violence, SBS reported.

'Blanc’s strategies for attracting women are eerily similar to diagnostic charts for family violence,' he said.

'The attitude of some men is that women are property. So now, let me address those particular men. If you think manipulating women is clever, you’re wrong. And if you think shoving a woman’s face into your crotch is power, you are wrong.'

Mr Lay also had a message for Mr Blanc's followers, saying both the 'pick-up artist' and they were 'sexually insecure'. 

He took aim at The Game - a novel written by Neil Strauss - which documents the author's time learning about picking up women with a secret society of people led by a man only known as 'Mystery'.

He said the popular book was written by a 'self-conscious fool'.

Mr Blanc arrived in Australia last month to hold seminars to teach men how to pick up women, but was met with great opposition, eventually having his visa cancelled by the federal government.

He got similar receptions in the U.K. and Canada, with people protesting against their respective governments letting the American into their countries.
