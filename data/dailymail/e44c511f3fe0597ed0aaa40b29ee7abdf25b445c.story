Shocking: Emily Davis was struck by lightning on Monday but miraculously managed to escape with no serious injuries even after watching an 'orb' of lightning travel up her umbrella

A California woman who was struck by lightning in a rare Bay Area electrical storm says she's extremely lucky to be alive.

Emily Davis was crossing a Berkeley street Monday around 1pm when she had an overpowering metal taste in her mouth and then saw the electricity moving along her metal umbrella.

Davis managed to make it out of the storm uninjured, but even hours later when her boyfriend gave her a relieved kiss he said she tasted strongly of metal.

The 31-year-old Missouri native told Berkeleyside that it began with a clap of thunder like an explosion.

Then came the metallic taste and in a flash the lightning had hit her.

'I saw an orb of light travel down the umbrella handle I was holding in my right hand,' Davis said. 'Thankfully I was holding the plastic end of the umbrella, or else I wouldâ€™ve been in big trouble.'

The coffee she carried in her other hand flew from her to the ground as that arm shook uncontrollably and her heart began to race from the fear of it all, she said.

'It was absolutely terrifying,' she said Monday. 'My heart was racing. I am just thankful that my shoes had no metal in them.'

Hours after Davis' miraculous escape from serious injury, her boyfriend kissed her goodbye as they parted ways for the evening and said he still tasted of metal.

It was a lasting reminder of a terrifying experience that was also an echo from her family's past.

When she told her father about the strike, she learned something shocking.

'He told me that my great great great grandfather was struck and killed by lightning while sitting on a horse,' she said.

With no physical wounds of her one-in-700,000 experience, Davis is now in search of proof it really happened and has reached out to area business in hopes there is CCTV footage of the strike.
