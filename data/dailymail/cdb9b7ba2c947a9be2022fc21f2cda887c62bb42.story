A group of young farmers have posed in nothing but wellies and flat caps for a daring photoshoot - all in the name of charity.

The men and women of Bedfordshire's Young Farmers stripped off for a series of nude photographs to raise money for mental health charity, Mind.

The charity calendar was the brainchild of 20-year-old Emily Steaggles after her best friend Lizzie Barnes tragically committed suicide in December 2012.

July features the Biggleswade boys baring all during a game of cricket, while the Leighton Buzzard girls are hitting the right notes in December, singing songs around the piano.

Emily, from Barton-Le-Clay, Beds, spent three months planning and shooting the calendar, with farming communities from all over Bedfordshire posing for the project.

Emily said: 'Lizzie introduced me to Young Farmers in 2006 and from day one I enjoyed everything it had to offer as did Lizzie. She entered almost every activity and competition going, and went to all the events.

'The last naked calendar produced by Bedfordshire Young Farmers Club was in 2009, Lizzie wasn't of age to participate but was very keen to if another one ever came about.

'So I decided a calendar would be a great way to celebrate all that YFC has to offer, and all the things that Lizzie enjoyed, whilst raising money for such a fantastic charity that helps people suffering with mental health issues, so they can get the help they need.

'Mind is one of the most recognised mental health charities and it provides support and advice for those suffering, ensuring they are not alone.'

A total of 76 people took part in the Â£10 calendar, which also includes four horses, ten dogs and fourteen sheep.

Emily added: 'The Biggleswade girls who did a stock judging theme with the sheep had me in fits of laughter as sheep aren't the easiest animals to control, especially when they are being straddled by a girls who is completely starkers.

'The sheep were leaping about and trying to jump out of the pen while Gina Andrews, who luckily is a Jockey for a living, clung on in just her birthday suit.

'Nothing was too bad about the shoots, other than controlling lots of naked men; Woburn lads are a bit of a handful and have always enjoyed running around without clothes, which apparently is quite a regular occurrence.

'Some people jumped at the chance to show a bit of flesh, others only built up the courage because they knew it was for such a great cause and knew that Lizzie would be looking down laughing at us all.'
