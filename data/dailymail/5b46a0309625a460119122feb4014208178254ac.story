It might not be his traditional attire but as storms lashed the city of Tacloban in the Philippines, Pope Francis seemed thankful for a yellow rain poncho to keep him dry.

The leader of the Catholic Church travelled to the area to meet with survivors of the devastating Typhoon Haiyan - but was forced to cut his own trip short because of another approaching storm.

Arriving at a cathedral in the city of Palo today, without the usual ceremony and procession, he told a surprised crowd that he would have to leave four hours ahead of schedule.

Waiting: People donned plastic rain ponchos in a bid to keep dry as they lined the streets on Palo in the Philippines waiting for Pope Francis

'I apologise to all of you,' he said, speaking in Italian through a translator. 'I am sad about this, truly saddened.'

The Pope said the pilots of the Philippine Airlines jet told him the weather would worsen, adding: 'We barely have time to get to the plane.' 

Meanwhile a private jet carrying several Philippine cabinet officials who accompanied Francis to Leyte blew its front tyres during take-off following the Pope's plane and veered off the runway. 

There were no injuries and ambulances evacuated the passengers, police said, while the Pope's plane apparently left without incident. 

The storms also ended in tragedy for a 27-year-old volunteer who was killed when a scaffolding holding huge speakers was blown over by the wind, Leyte health officials said.

Kristel Padasas was volunteering with charity Catholic Relief Services at a mass today when she suffered a fractured skull and was rushed to hospital, where she died.

Earlier, Francis had addressed 150,000 Catholic faithful gathered in an open field near the airport in Tacloban, the city hit hardest by Typhoon Haiyan.

He told them: 'So many of you have lost everything. I don't know what to say to you, but the Lord does know what to say to you. Some of you lost part of your families. All I can do is keep silent. And I walk with you all with my silent heart.'

Giving a thumbs up: Pope Francis arrived in Tacloban, Philippines today to greet a rain-drenched but lively crowd to welcome him to the city

Many in the crowd wept as Francis spoke, overcome by the memory of the November 2013 storm that levelled entire villages with ferocious winds and 21ft waves and left more than 7,300 people dead or missing.  

Tropical Storm Mekkhala was expected to make landfall on nearby Samar Island in the late afternoon or early evening with winds of up to 80mph, the weather bureau said.

Francis drew applause when he told the audience that he had decided to visit the city of 200,000 in eastern Leyte province in the days immediately after the storm.

'I wanted to come to be with you. It's a bit late, I have to say, but I am here.'

Catching a glimpse: At a mass near the airport, he put aside his prepared homily and delivered a very personal, emotional message of comfort to survivors, who stood amid puddles in mud-soaked fields and along roadsides

Popemobile: He travelled through the streets to greet well-wishers before having to inform people that the storms would cut his trip short

The Pope, speaking through an interpreter who translated his comments into English from his native Spanish, said he 'respected the feelings' of those who felt they had been let down by God because of the disaster but implored them to move forward in their faith.

Francis spoke in his native Spanish, which he reverts to when he wants to speak from the heart. He ditched his prepared homily and instead composed a brief prayer off the cuff that began: 'Thank you, Lord, for sharing our pain. Thank you, Lord, for giving us hope.'

As he spoke, the winds whipped the altar cloth and threatened to topple the candlesticks.

After the mass, his motorcade took him past cheering crowds and following a quick exchange of gifts, in which Francis received a wood image of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception made from the debris from the typhoon-damaged church, his convoy sped to the airport in Tacloban.

The papal delegation was soaked when it boarded the plane, and trip organisers asked the flight crew to turn off the air conditioning to prevent the passengers from catching a cold.

He asked the crowd to hold a moment of silence and thanked those who helped in the rescue effort after the worst recorded storm ever to make landfall

Ferry services were suspended to Leyte province, stranding thousands of travellers including some who wanted to see the Pope.

A police official estimated the crowd at the mass at 150,000 before the Pope's arrival and said tens of thousands more were lined up outside the airport area.

Francis blew kisses, waved and flashed the thumbs-up sign to the crowd while riding on a covered popemobile from the airport terminal to the nearby altar. 

Tomorrow, he is due to celebrate the final mass of the visit in Manila's Rizal Park, where as many as six million people are expected. St John Paul II drew a record five million people to his final mass in Manila in 1995, and organisers say they think Francis could top that record.

The papal Mass was accelerated and the remainder of the programme - a visit to a nearby cathedral, lunch with survivors and the blessing of a new centre for the poor - was compacted so he could leave four hours early because of worsening conditions

The Vatican said he blessed the centre from his car and he also stopped briefly at the home of a poor fisherman on his way into Tacloban city after the Mass

Before announcing he was cutting short his visit Saturday to Palo, one of the towns devastated by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, Pope Francis told people inside the packed Palo Cathedral that it was the birthday of his No. 2, Cardinal Pietro Parolin and asked to sing Happy Birthday

Arriving: The strong wind blew the white skull cap from Francis' head and rippled his white cassock as he disembarked from his plane
