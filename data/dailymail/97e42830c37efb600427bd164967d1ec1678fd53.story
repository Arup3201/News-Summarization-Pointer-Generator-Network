A cyclist has been killed in a collision with a lorry in central London today, becoming the third to die in the capital in three weeks. 

It is believed the man, who was in his early forties, was dragged under the wheels of a tipper truck at about 9.25am in High Holborn.

The driver of the lorry, a 51-year-old man, stopped at the scene.

He has now been arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving, Metropolitan police have said.

As well as today's fatality, 41-year-old father Paul Hutcheson was run over just outside Lewisham town centre on June 24, and 20-year-old Philippine de Gerin-Ricard died at Aldgate on Friday July 5.

A nearby waiter has told the Evening Standard he witnessed the whole incident today and called an ambulance to help.

The waiter, who asked not to be named, said he saw a rucksack flying out of the back of the lorry and then saw a body and later the bike.

He said he and two other bystanders carried out CPR on the victim until police and ambulance arrived. 

He said: 'People were hysterical. It was really disturbing.'.

122 cyclists died last year - 14 in London.

As well as today's fatality, 41-year-old father Paul Hutcheson was run over just outside Lewisham town centre on June 24, and 20-year-old Philippine de Gerin-Ricard died at Aldgate on Friday July 5

Ms Philippine de Gerin-Ricard died after colliding with a lorry while riding a 'Boris Bike' in a cycle lane on a busy London thoroughfare.

The 20-year-old woman was rushed to hospital after the hire bike crashed with the heavy goods vehicle on Whitechapel High Street in east London, but was later pronounced dead.

Transport for London said it was the first fatality involving one of the hire bikes - dubbed Boris Bikes after they were launched by the London Mayor in 2010.

Father-of-two Paul Hutcheson died after suffering serious injuries in a collision at a Lewisham junction during the morning rush hour.

The London Cycling Campaign is now organising a second #space4cycling protest ride tomorrow in honour of the dead cyclist.

Only last Friday, 1500 people rode through Aldgate to protest at the lack of safe space for cycling.

LCC chief executive Ashok Sinha said: 'Three Londoners have now been killed in three weeks, all of them on busy roads that provide no dedicated space for cycling.

'Mayor Boris Johnson must take swift and radical steps to redesign our streets to make them safe and inviting for cycling.

'The evidence is clear: if he doesn't do this, then more Londoners will die needlessly cycling on our city streets.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
