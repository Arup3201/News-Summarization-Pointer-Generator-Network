A hero coastguard risked his life to save four stricken rowers on Saturday, diving into the ocean in pitch darkness and gale-force winds because the waters were too rough to send a rescue boat.

The daring rescue took place at around 1am on Saturday after the four-man rowing boat began taking on water in the Pacific Ocean about 75 miles west of San Luis Obispo as the competed in the Great Pacific Race from Monterey, California, to Hawaiian capital Hono足lulu.

With little more than a flashlight on his helmet to see, PO3 Leon managed to hoist three of the men to safety.

But because there was no room left in the helicopter, PO3 Leon stayed with the fourth rower for three hours while the chopper ferried his friends to dry land before it returned to pick the pair up at 4am.

'This was the most challenging rescue I've ever had,' PO3 Leon, an Air Station San Francisco rescue swimmer, said in a statement.

'It was unique because there was no 
light, seas were incredibly rough, and waves were crashing over the top 
of the boat, which was already filled with water,' Leon added.

Training: They had been taking part in the Great Pacific Race from Monterey, California, to Hawaiian capital Hono足lulu when they ran into trouble in bad weather

Ready, set, go! The Great Pacific Race is a 2,400-mile competition from Monterey, California, to Hawaiian capital Hono足lulu

All four rowers are reportedly in good condition and did not require further medical attention.

It was the second time authorities were called to help during the inaugural 2,400-mile competition this weekend.

At 6am on Sunday, a solo rower was hoisted from his boat to a helicopter after capsizing several times in rough seas about 50 miles west of Morro Bay.

Organizers identified the rower as Jim Bauer, who the federal agency said was in stable condition. Bauer called the Coast Guard with a satellite phone, and his boat was equipped with a satellite tracking beacon.

'A lot of planning was involved in this particular rescue, due to low visibility and challenging weather conditions,' said Lt. Cmdr. Blake McKinney, a Coast Guard pilot based in San Francisco who was involved in Bauer's rescue.

The rower was well equipped for the Great Pacific Race from Monterey to Hono足lulu, filing a float plan, bringing a satellite phone and ensuring he had appropriate gear for the rough seas, McKinney said. Those preparations 'increased his chance for survival,' the official said.
