Treasury officials harbour ‘grave doubts’ over whether George Osborne will be able to deliver promised tax cuts after the next election because of the state of the public finances, it was claimed yesterday.

An analysis suggested the Chancellor will have to cut £48billion in the next five years to meet his austerity targets, twice the level previously thought necessary.

If the Tories continue to protect spending on the NHS, schools and foreign aid, other areas of spending – including welfare, the police, local government, environment, justice and defence – will have to take a third out of their budgets, it suggested.

Mr Osborne has insisted that £25billion is needed to eradicate the deficit, promising to raise it all from public spending cuts. 

Between 2015-16 and 2018-19 public spending will have to fall by £48billion, with the axe falling on unprotected departments like welfare, defence and police

An analysis by the Financial Times suggests only half of the reductions have yet been found.  

When the coalition was formed in 2010, Mr Osborne promised to balance the books with five years.

The new research suggests that the promise to save £25billion over the next five years will not be enough to get Britain out of the red.  

Between 2015-16 and 2018-19 public spending will have to fall by £48billion. The figure has prompted doubts inside the Treasury over whether the Tories’ promise of big tax cuts will be achievable.

In total, the tax cuts will cost around £7billion. However, the research suggests Mr Osborne’s commitment to save a further £25billion over the next five years will not be enough.

Using data from the Office for Budget Responsibility on spending up to 2018-19, the analysis found that an extra £48.7billion in spending reductions is needed. Total public spending will fall from £312billion in 2014-15 to £264billion in 2018-19.

Chancellor George Osborne has pledged to raise £12billion in new benefit cuts for people of working age

It means unprotected departments face cuts of 33 per cent over the next five years, compared to 21 per cent since 2009-10. Total public spending in unprotected areas will fall from £144billion to £96billion, the research suggested.

A Treasury source said: ‘There are obviously different ways of presenting things to get different numbers, but we have always been clear there are tough decisions to be taken. We have clearly shown over this parliament that we have been able to get a grip on public spending while at the same time cutting taxes for hardworking people.’ 

It raises doubts about the Tories' promise of major tax cuts after the election. 

David Cameron announced plans to increase the amount workers can earn before paying tax to £12,500, and increase the 40p rate threshold to £50,000.

But the tax package is expected to cost £7billion in total. 

Mr Cameron has also promised real terms increase in NHS spending, while schools and international development spending will also escape the axe.

It means that unprotected departments face cuts of 33 per cent over the next five years, compared to 21 per cent since 2009-10.

It means total public in unprotected areas will fall from £144billion to £96billion, the FT said.

Mr Osborne wants to raise £12billion in a new round of cuts to benefits for people of working age.

But other big spending areas will still face swinging cuts.

Britain's top military officer yesterday warned against further cuts to the armed forces.

Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nicholas Houghton said that David Cameron does not want to reduce the number of troops in Britain's 82,000-strong armed forces.

'I know the Prime Minister does not want again to cut the physical manpower of the armed forces. But there is of course still further fiscal consolidation to face,’ he said.

 

The Prime Minister has said repeatedly that he does not wants further reductions to the size of the Armed Forces, and suggested the UK should spend at least two per cent of its national income.

However, areas of the Ministry of Defence budget are likely to come under pressure in a new round of spending cuts after the general election, whoever is in power.

Sir Nicholas also told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme there had been some 'early glitches' in the attempt to recruit 30,000 Army reservists to plug the gap left by cuts to regular troops.

Sir Nicholas said: '30,000 by 2018 was always going to be quite a tall order, and there have been some early glitches in that campaign to recruit those.'

But he added: 'There's much to be confident about - our numbers are growing.'
