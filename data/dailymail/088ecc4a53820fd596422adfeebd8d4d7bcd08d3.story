An out of control car ended up pushing another vehicle into a Florida swimming pool.

It all happened at the Ocean Mile Inn in Fort Lauderdale when a Toyota Camry smashed into Sarah Ahlstrom's rental.

The sight of the car floating in the pool of the motel left people stunned.

Making waves: Seconds after the car is shoved into the pool, waves are still visible from the impact

'I thought we'd been bombed,' said Ms Ahlstrom. 'I've never heard a noise that loud ever,' she told the Sun Sentinel.

She thought about the possibility of a very different outcome had she been closer to the car at the time of the accident.

'Another 10 minutes, I would have been dead,' she said mentioning that she was about to pick up some fluffy slippers that had been left on the car's back seat.

The female driver of the Toyota Camry is currently in hospital with life-threatening injuries.

Motel guests are glad no one was at the pool when the car plunged inside. 'I feel very grateful, I thank God ... it was a horrible thing,' said motel guest Ilona Dihanyi.

Nudged in: The cash occured here where an out-of-control vehicle crashed into a parked rental car pushing it into the swimming pool

Theories: Camera footage appears to show the white car swerving to avoid the black vehicle in the center of the photo. This ultimately led to the accident

The owners of the inn, Fernando Chang and Karelia Freites, were confused at first because they could not see any driver from the car that ended up in the pool.

Soon they realised that there had only been one victim in the crash.

It's not clear what caused the accident however surveillance cameras show a driver traveling in the wrong direction of the A1A highway.

A white vehicle is seen on surveillance videoÂ  speeding northbound in the southbound lanes of A1A in Fort Lauderdale.

The driver almost hits a black car that was pulling into a parking lot. The car then slammed into a parked car and pushed it into a motel pool.

It's thought that the driver in the crash was dodging another car to avoid a collision.

The inn owners say after removing the debris and replacing the water, they intend to replace the fence around the pool with something a little stronger.
