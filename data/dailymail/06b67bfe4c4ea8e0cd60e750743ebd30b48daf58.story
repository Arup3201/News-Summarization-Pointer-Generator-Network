Ashley Cole was put through his paces during Roma training ahead of a possible return to the side to face Manchester City in Wednesday's crucial Champions League clash.

Victory against the Premier League champions in Italy will be enough to see Roma join group winners Bayern Munich in the knockout stage.

Cole has struggled to make the impact manager Rudi Garcia would have been hoping for when he signed for the title-chasing Italians after leaving Chelsea in the summer.

The 33-year-old has not featured for Roma since the 2-1 win away against Atalanta on November 22 - Cole was culpable for the concession of the goal that day and has found himself benched for the last three games, including key games against CSKA Moscow and Inter Milan.

The former England international was also hooked by Garcia at half-time during Bayern Munich's 7-1 demolition of Roma in October, after Cole was hopelessly exposed by winger Arjen Robben.

In fact, 33-year-old Cole's greatest contribution since moving to the Italian capital came when he was pictured standing awkwardly on the periphery of the Roma squad during a team photo, sparking an internet sensation.

Roma's chances of progressing to the last-16 were increased when Segio Aguero limped out of Saturday's Premier League game with a knee injury, but Garcia is a disappointed the Argentine will not be lining up against his side.

'It's a shame,' he told reporters. 'Aguero is such a great player and if it's really a serious injury then that is a pity for football.

'I'd have preferred to see him at the Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday.'
