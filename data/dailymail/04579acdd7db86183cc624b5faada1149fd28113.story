BBC weather forecasters have been accused of driving away tourists from seaside resorts with 'alarmist' reports of floods and storms.

One holiday park owner in Devon criticised meteorologists for 'trying to cover all eventualities' to avoid a repeat of the infamous 1987 hurricane blooper by Michael Fish.

Another, who runs resorts in Suffolk, said staycationers were 'terrified' to come to his sites because of fears their caravans would be left 'bobbing around' on flood water.

'Alarmist': Seaside resorts have accused BBC forecasters of driving away tourists with overly negative predictions, but in some areas such as Bracklesham Caravan Park (pictured) in West Sussex they have proved accurate

Angry: One resort owner in Suffolk said meteorologists were tarnishing the whole country with a 'single wet weather symbol' by making it seem like floods such as this one in a Welsh caravan park would affect all tourist hotspots

They are now asking for weathermen to not tarnish the whole country with a 'single wet-weather symbol' and be 'more careful with their phrasing'.

Claire Jeavons, who runs the Beverley Park holiday site in Paignton, Devon, said 'alarmist' forecasts, which often proved groundless, were having a major impact on bookings across the West Country.

She said: 'It is already causing holiday-makers to stay away. Just a few days ago we were hearing that all caravan parks in the West Country were on flood alert and this simply wasn't the case.

'We've been receiving many calls from worried customers, but we assure them that flooding at our altitude would also mean the entire English Riviera was hundreds of feet underwater.'

'Trying to cover all eventualities': Waves crash into Porthcawl lighthouse during a storm. Forecasters have been accused of over-egging reports to ensure they don't end up with another 'Michael Fish' incident

Tony Clish, director of Park Holidays UK, which has more than 700 caravans at Felixstowe Beach Holiday Park and Suffolk Sands Holiday Park, said: 'Just last week we were told that all caravan parks in southern England were on flood alert and this simply wasn't the case.

'Some parks in Wales did flood recently, but that's no reason to suggest that caravans in Suffolk would soon be bobbing around on parks which have never flooded before.'

He added: 'Coastal holiday parks in Suffolk often stay dry when it is raining inland, yet forecasters frequently tarnish the whole county with a single wet-weather symbol.'

BBC weather presenter Tomasz Schafernaker said there was no reason why forecasters would want to 'dampen the sprits or be deliberately pessimistic.'

'Our job to focus of negatives': BBC weather presenter Tomasz Schafernaker said forecasters needed to warn people of any dangers

Mr Schafernaker, who predicts the weather on BBC South East Today, said: 'I understand the frustration and there is a tendency for weather forecasters to emphasise on the negative aspects of the weather.

'It's just that our job is to pick out the most important parts of the weather which can affect people's lives.

'If indeed there's going to be a shower somewhere we need to flag up that possibility.'

In 1987, Mr Fish drew stinging criticism when he flatly denied a viewer's claim that a hurricane was about to hit Britain just hours before the Great Storm caused devastation across the country.
