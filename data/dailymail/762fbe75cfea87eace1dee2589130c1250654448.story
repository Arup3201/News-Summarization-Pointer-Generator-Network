Lord Chief Justice John Thomas said knife carrying was 'commonplace' among 'very young children' who were members of criminal gangs and called for an urgent review of jail terms

The country’s most senior judge last night launched an impassioned plea for longer jail terms for knife yobs.

Lord Chief Justice John Thomas said knife carrying was ‘commonplace’ among ‘very young children’ who were members of criminal gangs and called for an urgent review of jail terms.

His comments came in a week in which two teenagers were stabbed to death in London in a 48-hour period.

His comments also reignited the political row over knife sentencing which exploded last week when it emerged Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg was blocking Justice Secretary Chris Grayling’s plans for automatic prison sentences for offenders caught twice with a knife.

Supporters of reform seized on the judge’s comments yesterday, saying they reinforced the need for a new approach.

Lord Thomas, the most senior judge in England and Wales, made his comments to a committee of Peers in the House of Lords.

He told the House of Lords Constitution Committee there was ‘one area where I am concerned that we have a proper and objective look at youth sentencing’.

He said: ‘There is obviously a really serious problem in relation to knives. The carrying of knives has become commonplace in gangs and with children who are very young.

‘And it’s easy to have a reaction to that. I think we need to look very, very carefully at the best way of using the various levels of sentencing to control the use of knives. I think this is something which is urgently required.

‘We’ve been extraordinarily successful in this country in controlling the use of guns, but knives, particularly knives carried by 12, 13, 14-year-olds, is a major problem.’

He added: ‘This is a problem which is very, very serious, which is rightly a real concern.’

Tory MPs welcomed the comments. Nick de Bois, who has tabled a Commons amendment in an effort to change the law said: ‘They suggest to me that the courts recognise that we haven’t got sentencing right on many levels in relation to knife crime.’

‘For many people going to court for carrying a knife is just an occupational hazard, and in too many cases cautions, fines and slaps on the wrist are being given out.’

His comments also reignited the political row over knife sentencing which exploded last week when it emerged Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg was blocking Justice Secretary Chris Grayling's plans for automatic prison sentences for offenders caught twice with a knife

Despite the law being changed in 2012 to target knife thugs, many still escape a jail term.

Ministry of Justice figures show that in the year to December 231 yobs aged 10-17 caught with a knife escaped a jail term despite being caught with a knife on more than one occasion.

The vast majority received community sentences, and 12 walked away with nothing but a reprimand or warning.

A separate, tougher law for those caught brandishing a knife has a higher custody rate. Under this law anyone aged 16 or 17 should get a minimum term of four months but there is no minimum sentence for under 16s.

A-level student Alim Uddin, 17, was beaten and stabbed to death in Brixton following a row over a second-hand bike. It was one of two fatal stabbings within 24 hours in the capital

The judge’s comments come after a spate of violent deaths in London. Jamil Palmer, 18, became the second young man stabbed to death in the capital in just 48 hours when he was stabbed walking through a park with a friend in the middle of Tuesday afternoon.

Yesterday a mother of four Tara Thornley, 42, told yesterday how she tried to save his life while walking her nine-year-old son home from school in Feltham.

She said: ‘I left my boy on the path and fought my way through some nettles and saw a boy lying down and covered in blood.

‘As a mother I felt so bad for him and I think I’ll have nightmares about this for ever. I couldn’t even tell how long I was with him, I was in a haze. I’ll never forget the look in his eyes. It was empty. I knew he was dying.’

The attack happened less than 48 hours after A-level student Alim Uddin, 17, was beaten and stabbed to death in Brixton following a row over a second-hand bike.

He was killed trying to collect a second-hand bicycle he had bought for £90. A 16-year-old boy was due to appear before magistrates in Camberwell today charged with his murder.

His mother Parool said: ‘Our children are being killed and nothing is being done. They are dying like dogs.’

Last week the Mail revealed senior Lib Dems were blocking a crackdown proposed by the Tories, only days after teacher Ann Maguire was stabbed to death in her classroom.

In one letter to Mr Clegg, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander insists jailing more offenders caught with blades would be too expensive.

The plans were drawn up by Mr Grayling to ensure offenders caught more than once with a blade are automatically jailed.

Tory MPs now hope to force the change through with help from Labour even in the face of Lib Dem opposition.

Aminur Nadir Khan, 20, Mashudur Rahman, 22, and Ali Akbar Choudhury, 20, were told they will serve a minimum of 23 years for stabbing 16-year-old Ajmol Alom.

The teenager was days away from receiving his GCSE results when he was attacked near his home in Poplar, east London, last August.

Sentencing his three attackers at Snaresbrook Crown Court in east London, Judge Martyn Zeidman said knives led to 400 deaths in the year to March last year.

He added: ‘This knife madness must end. There has to be a change. But cold figures can never sufficiently reflect the tragic sorrow caused by knife crime.’
