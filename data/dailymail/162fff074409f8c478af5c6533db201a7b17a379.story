Allan McGregor saved an early penalty to help earn Hull a point in what must rate as one of the lowest quality games of this Premier League season so far - but Hull have nonetheless fallen into the relegation zone despite getting something from the game.

Their failure to win, combined with QPR beating Burnley, means they drop a place and into the bottom three. West Brom, who were if anything even less threatening than Hull, remain very much in trouble.

It wouldn’t be harsh on either to club to say they’ve been poor this season and are both in serious danger of a season-long relegation scrap. So the prospect of brilliant entertainment was always remote between teams low on confidence and in fear of getting dragged into the drop zone.

‘We lacked that cutting edge in the final third,’ said Hull’s manager Steve Bruce, whose team had only two shots on target. ‘It was one of those frustrating days. You take a point and move on.’

He singled out McGregor for praise. The Scottish goalkeeper saved an early penalty from Graham Dorrans, albeit a poorly taken one, and later thwarted Craig Gardner with a brilliant leap.

‘The save from Gardner was arguably the save of the season,’ Bruce said.

He added that the expectation on Hull to stay up is ‘unbelievable’, but repeated that they are still new to this division.

‘I still think we’ve got enough [quality] in the squad to see us through,’ he said.

Hull started the day in the more lowly position in the table, in 17th place with 12 points but West Brom were only one place and one point higher. Hull came into this with just one win in their league 13 league games - and only six in the entire calendar year. West Brom kicked off on the back of four straight defeats and one win in eight.

The Baggies last defeat was at home to West Ham in midweek and Alan Irvine made four changes to his starting XI to face Hull. Craig Dawson, Chris Baird and Saido Berahino were all benched while Chris Brunt is out injured. In came Gareth McAuley, Sebastien Pocognoli, Youssouf Mulumbu and James Morrison.

Hull ended a four-game losing run of their own in midweek by squeaking a draw at Everton and Steve Bruce made two changes from that draw. Mohamed Diame and Nikica Jelavic were out injurted and benched respectively, replaced by Abel Hernandez - back after paternity leave, of sorts - and Sone Aluko.

The first half of this match was so poor and light on chances that there was plenty of time to discuss the ins and outs of Uruguayan paternity leave with the locals. Bruce had pronounced himself surprised when Hernandez needed to go back to South America but apparently local laws there meant his partner needed the baby’s father with her in order to bring their new child out of the country. 

In other local gossip, on an afternoon when it was necessary to find something interesting to supplement the football, Hull are being investigated by Uefa for alleged breaches of Financial Fair Play rules. They’re under the microscope because of losses last least and because they played in Europe this season. What a long, long time ago that seems now.

It’s not quite accurate to say nothing whatsoever of any interest happened in the first half but suffice to say that the only shot on target was a penalty - and it was saved.

West Brom thought they should have had a spot kick in the third minute when Victor Anichebe was tugged by Michael Dawson but referee Michael Oliver gave nothing, either because he didn’t see it, or thought it was a marginal offence outside the box.

Oliver did award a penalty a few minutes later, and rightly so, when Anichebe was felled by Jake Livermore, who wrestled him to the ground. Graham Dorrans stepped up for the visitors and hit his effort not particularly hard, leaving Allan McGregor with a much easier job of a save than should have been the case. 

West Brom had a third penalty shout of the game in the opening 11 minutes when Mulumbu claimed his shot had been deliverately handled by Tom Huddlestone. But Oliver said it was a case of ball to hand and that looked to be the right call with the naked eye.

To describe anything else in the first half as a ‘chance’ would be to overstate the case of the few sporadic moments of ‘threat’. Ahmed Elmohamady and Sone Aluko exchanged passes that might have led to something but that moved as cut off and the ball was cleared by Joleon Lescott. And David Meyler had a shot blocked by Gareth McAuley.

Things got better in the second half - but not by much. Hernandez shot wide three minutes after the break, and then team-mate Sone Aluko did the same. Then with nearly an hour gone came the best chance since the penalty when Livermore crossed to Stephen Quinn, who placed a headed effort on target, low and right, only to see Ben Foster dive and save it.

West Brom then had their best opportunity since the penalty as Craig Gardner won a free kick from a foul by Tom Huddlestone and cracked it towards goal from the left of the ‘D’. McGregor made a flying save to deny him.

At the other end, Hernandez got on the end of a free kick from Robbie Brady but could only flash his header wide. Hull increasingly took the game to West Brom, finally finding some urgency. But it was took little, too late.
