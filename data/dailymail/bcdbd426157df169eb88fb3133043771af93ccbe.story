Access to safe drinking water is undoubtedly the most essential requirement for every traveller. But knowing where it is safe to drink the water  can be confusing, with conflicting information available.

A new infographic using research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies which countries have safe water for visitors - and which do not.

It is important to note that not all the countries indicated as 'unsafe' here have water that is necessarily unclean or polluted.

Rather, it can be harmful to those who have not built up a tolerance to it as locals have, so visitors (particularly those with sensitive systems) should be cautious. 

The CDC reports that no countries on the continents of Africa and South America contain water suitable for drinking, and a handful in Asia: Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Brunei, Israel and South Korea. 

In Oceania, Australia and New Zealand benefit from safe drinking water, with the CDC advising to avoid drinking water in the rest.

A large number of European countries have treated water that is deemed drinkable, though there are several in Eastern Europe where caution is advised. Full details are shown on the infographic below.

Illnesses that can be transmitted through water include cholera, hepatitis A, typhoid and travellers' diarrhoea.

The infographic, compiled by NeoMam Studios, also includes advice on how to prevent illness by being aware of the water with which you brush your teeth and shower.

Tips on how to make untreated water safe for drinking are also noted.
