A bottle of red wine is usually associated with a splitting headache the next day, but this time it caused a different kind of headache for a man who attempted to rob a Canberra supermarket.

About 6.40pm on Thursday, a man brandishing a bladed weapon made threats to staff at a supermarket in Cook – north-west of Canberra – when a bold customer struck the offender on the back of the head with an unopened bottle of red wine.

In CCTV footage, a customer is seen standing by a shop display when they take up a bottle and walk up behind the offender, and comes to the rescue by knocking him with the makeshift weapon.

CCTV captured the moment when a brave customer helped stop a robbery by hitting the thief with a bottle of red wine on Thursday

The glass bottle shatters and sends red wine all over the offender and on the floor.

In shock, the offender is seen stumbling forward before running off without taking any cash or property.

Police have described the offender as 174cm tall and wearing a dark-coloured hoodie jacket.

But the Cook crime was one of three incidents that happened on Thursday night.

The offender was threatening staff with a knife, demanding money at a Cook supermarket in Canberra's north-west

The thief appears to be in shock as he stumbles forward during the incident, which happened about 6.40pm

About 20 minutes after the first incident, a Caucasian man of normal build in his 20s who was between 165cm and 170cm entered another supermarket in Scullin – also in Canberra’s north-west – with a knife and made threats to staff.

He fled from the scene when a car pulled up in the parking lot outside.

The same knife-wielding offender struck again about 10 minutes later at a business in Higgins – almost 2km from Scullin – again he demanded money and threatened staff.

When staff refused to meet the demand, the offender ran off.

Police are urging anyone with information about the trio of incidents and have not yet spoken to them to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or report via the website at www.act.crimestoppers.com.au.

The offender, who has been described as 174cm by police, turns around to look at his attacker

He then runs away without any money or property - the first of three attempts that night to rob Canberra supermarkets
