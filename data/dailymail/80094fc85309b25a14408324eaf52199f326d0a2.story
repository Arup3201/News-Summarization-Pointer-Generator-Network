A ban on pupils’ packed lunches to help prop up the ‘economically bust’ school dinners system is being called for by  Government food advisers.

Restaurateurs Henry Dimbleby and John Vincent argue that this would save parents £2billion a year which could then be ploughed into school canteens.

And they believe that, if they cannot convince ministers to ban packed lunches, schools should police what parents give their children and confiscate unhealthy items such as sweets and fizzy drinks – although they admit it would be an uphill task.

Preparations: Cooking lessons at school will be compulsory for children aged seven to 14 from September

Mr Dimbleby said one headmaster said he had ‘other battles to fight’ when he suggested banning unhealthy snacks.

The system would rely on revamped school meals to tempt children more than ‘institutional’ meat and two veg and processed food. Mr Dimbleby and Mr Vincent, who own the Leon chain of restaurants, began surveying school meals last year.

Cooking lessons at school will become 
compulsory for children aged seven to 14 from September as the 
Government aims to ensure they can make up to 20 dishes before taking 
their GCSE exams.

Education Secretary Michael Gove is 
also considering banning packed lunches as ministers look at new ways of
 improving diets while they battle with soaring child obesity, reported 
the Sunday Times.

Leon fast food chain founders Henry Dimbleby and John Vincent were tasked last year by Mr Gove, 45, with moving on the campaign for better school meals begun by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, 37.

Lunchtime: There are no signs of Turkey Twizzlers and meals have improved over the past decade

Mr Dimbleby and Mr Vincent want 
pupils to be banned from bringing in packed lunches or leaving the 
premises at lunchtime, at a time when only 40 per cent of children are 
eating school meals.

They 
suggest parents should spend the £2billion that annually goes on packed 
lunches on school meals instead, and double the take-up percentage over 
five years, reported the Sunday Times.

‘Rather
 than ask government to subsidise a structurally bust system we want the
 system to become solvent by getting more customers to pay for school 
dinners,’ Mr Dimbleby told the newspaper.

The pair said the majority of packed 
lunches are normally a sandwich, chocolate bar, packet of crisps and an 
apple, which is often put back in the lunchbox again and again when 
brought home by pupils.

During tours of school canteens, they
 were pleased to find no sign of Turkey Twizzlers - famously criticised 
by Mr Oliver eight years ago - and said the meals have improved over the
 past decade.

But former Eton pupil Mr Dimbleby told the Sunday Times: ‘There’s still too much processed food in school canteens. Some of the meals I ate were a bit institutional - meat and two veg.’

The duo added that the Government cannot afford to invest the £60billion required to rescue the school dinner system - and that parents will have to foot the bill to solve the problem.

Mr Dimbleby and Mr Vincent’s chain has 13 restaurants in London and the South East, specialises in burger, chicken and fish dishes and has an emphasis on sustainability and providing good nutrition.
