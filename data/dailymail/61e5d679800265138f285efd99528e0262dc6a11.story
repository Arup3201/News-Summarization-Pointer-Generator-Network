World super-middleweight champion Carl Froch says he may retire if a proposed fight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Las Vegas falls through.

Froch, 37, defended his IBF and WBA belts against George Groves at Wembley in May and vowed to finish on a high in Vegas, where he has never fought.

But he is considering quitting because he fears he may never secure a deal to fight Chavez and does not want to face ex-Olympic champion James DeGale.

‘If I can’t fight in Vegas, I need a serious think about whether I want to finish by fighting DeGale, and beating him,’ Froch told BBC Radio Nottingham.

‘I don’t know if I can get motivated to fight him. He’s not good enough. If Vegas can’t happen I’ll seriously consider retiring.’
