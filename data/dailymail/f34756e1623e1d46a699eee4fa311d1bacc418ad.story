As controversy grows over the regrading of SAT examinations, thousands of people have started sharing their own scores on social networks to put future generations at ease.

Well-known figures have been conspicuously quiet about their results, however, but with the likes of Ke$ha, James Woods and Natalie Portman reportedly getting close to a perfect 1600, perhaps they felt they'd only add pressure rather than ease it.

Famous faces with far lower SAT scores include Bill Cosby, who got a score lower than 500, Sopranos actress Drea De Matteo, believed to have scored around 800, and even former US President Bill Clinton, whose 1020 puts him a few hundred points below successor George W Bush.

Awkward: Even former US President Bill Clinton scored fairly low - with results of 1020 puts him more than 200 points below successor George W Bush's 1206

Scarlett Johansson admitted to 'feeling like a big dummy' when she confirmed her score of 1080, but that result actually puts her above the US average.

With rumoured scores of 1579, 1500 and 1150, actor James Woods, singer Ke$ha and actress Courtney Cox would also be placed far above average.

As you'd probably expect, Microsoft co-founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen got sky-high 1590 and a perfect 1600 respectively, with Apple's Steve Wozniak also scoring a perfect 800 on the maths section of the examination.

Will Smith and James Franco have both admitted getting 'very high' SAT scores in the past but neither has revealed the exact number, while the New York Times has previously reported that actor Ben Affleck 'had near perfect SAT scores in high school'.

Numbers: With 1100, actress Courtney Cox (left)  would also be placed far above average. Sadly for Sopranos star Drea De Matteo (right), her rumoured score of only 800 would see her fall short of that mark

Star: Singer and songwriter Ke$ha is believed to have received a score of around 1500 on her SAT exams

Meanwhile talk show host Rush Limbaugh, political commentator Bill O'Reilly and actor and economist Ben Stein picked up near-perfect scores of 1530, 1585 and 1573 respectively. 

It's not just conservatives with high scores though: Al Gore kept the tally high for the Democrat camp with a score of 1355. US president Barack Obama, on the other hand, has repeatedly refused to release his education records.

Not all celebrities fared brilliantly however, with presenter Howard Stern rumoured to have picked up a low 870, and baseball star Alex Rodriguez reaching just 910. Meanwhile stand-up comedian Janeane Garofalo is thought to have scored around 950.

As part of the sweeping changes with the SAT examinations, essays will become optional and there will no longer be penalties for wrong answers..

Changes in the annual test that millions of students take will also do away with some vocabulary words such as 'prevaricator' and 'sagacious' in favor of words more commonly used in school and on the job.

College Board officials said Wednesday the update — the first since 2005 — is needed to make the exam better representative of what students study in high school and the skills they need to succeed in college and afterward. The test should offer 'worthy challenges, not artificial obstacles,' said College Board President David Coleman at an announcement event in Austin, Texas.

The new exam will be rolled out in 2016, so this year's ninth graders will be the first to take it, in their junior year. The new SAT will continue to test reading, writing and math skills, with an emphasis on analysis. Scoring will return to a 1,600-point scale last used in 2004, with a separate score for the optional essay.

For the first time, students will have the option of taking the test on computers.

One of the biggest changes is that the extra penalty for wrong answers, which discouraged guessing, will be eliminated. And some vocabulary words will be replaced with words such as 'synthesis' and 'empirical' that are used more widely in classrooms and in work settings.

Coleman said many students who are terrified they will be tested on lots of SAT words currently have one recourse:  drilling with flashcards. He said educators know that flashcards are not the best way to build real word knowledge that lasts, but 'when the SAT rolls around they become the royal road. Students stop reading and start flipping.'

The essay will be changed in other ways, too. It will measure students' ability to analyze and explain how an author builds an argument, instead of measuring the coherence of the writing but not the quality or accuracy of the reasoning. It will be up to school districts and colleges the students apply to as to whether the essay will be required.

Each exam will include a passage drawn from 'founding documents' such as the Declaration of Independence or from discussions they've inspired.

New measurement: Essays will no longer be compulsory and wrong answers will not be penalized in the exams

Instead of testing a wide range of math concepts, the new exam will focus on a few areas, like algebra, deemed most needed for college and life afterward. A calculator will be allowed only on certain math questions, instead of on the entire math portion.

A longstanding criticism of the SAT is that students from wealthier households do better on the exam because they can afford expensive test preparation classes.

The College Board seeks to defuse that by saying it will partner with the nonprofit Khan Academy to provide free test preparation materials for the redesigned SAT. It also says every income-eligible student who takes the SAT will receive four fee waivers to apply for college, which continues an effort the College Board has had to assist low-income students.

These are the first SAT upgrades since 2005 when the essay portion was added and analogy questions were removed. There have been other notable changes to the test, such as in 1994 when antonym questions were removed and calculators were allowed for the first time. The test was first used in 1926.

The SAT was taken last year by 1.7 million students. It has historically been more popular on the coasts, while the other popular standardized college entrance exam, the ACT, dominated the central U.S. But the ACT overtook the SAT in overall use in 2012, in part because it is taken by almost every junior in 13 states as part of the states' testing regimen. Last year, the ACT said it would begin offering computer-based testing in 2015.
