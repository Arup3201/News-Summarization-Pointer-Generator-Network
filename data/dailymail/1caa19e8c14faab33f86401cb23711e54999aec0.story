A provocative Tumblr blog called Women Against Feminism is kicking up a predictable storm amongst women who do identify as feminists.

The blog collects photos of women posing with hand-written signs that all begin: 'I don't need feminism because...' - and are peppered with a variety of reasons, common themes including: 'I am not a victim,' 'I'm proud to be a stay-at-home mom,' and 'I love chivalry.'

Largely, the response to this blog - especially to posts such as 'I don't need feminism because I like when men say compliments about my body!' - has been less than favorable, with reactions ranging from mockery and disregard, to all-out horror.

Speaking out: Women Against Feminism is a Tumblr blog which invites people to pose with their own reasons as to why they are anti-feminist, and has attracted both support and a backlash

The campaign is reminiscent of the 2012 Who Needs Feminism Tumblr, which invited women to share their reasons for being pro-feminist, although Women Against Feminism don't claim their blog is a response to it.

Women Against Feminism has triggered countless angry responses, largely accusing 
submitters of having completely missed the concept of feminism, and branding them 'naive,' 'selfish,' and 'poorly educated.'

Posts such as these were especially criticized: 'I don't need feminism because my 
self-worth is not directly tied to the size of my victim complex!' And: 'As a woman in the Western world, I am not 
oppressed and neither are you!'

As
 a point of reference, the dictionary definition of the term describes 
feminism as: 'The theory of the political, economic, and social equality
 of the sexes.' The anonymous founder of the blog feels, however, that many modern feminists don't subscribe to this.

'Feminism is not what it claims to be,' she writes. 'Anyone can recite a dictionary definition. But my rejection of feminism comes from more real-life reasons.'

Loving life: Many of the submitters feel the war has already been won in terms of gender equality

History: This woman is referring to Susan Brownell Anthony, the American social reformer who played a pivotal role in the women's suffrage movement, which resulted in women's right to vote in 1920

Popular view: The feeling that feminism contradicts the traditions of a family is a commonly occurring thread for the Women Against Feminism

Stay-at-home mom: Many women defended their husbands or other male family members from what they feel is unfair prejudice

'I don't need feminism because I don't need to grow out my body hair to prove I'm equal to men,' one submission reads.

Another vented: 'Respecting my husband as the MAN in our marriage does not make me less of a woman! I don't need to demonize men.'

'How the f**k am I supposed to open jars and lift heavy things without my husband?'

Also found on Women Against Feminism are frequent posts from stay-at-home moms, such as: 'I don't need feminism because I made my own choice to be a stay at home mother and my working husband should not be harassed.'

Then there were several mentions of rape, with one woman posting: 'I don't need feminism because getting drunk at a party and having sex with a stranger is just irresponsibility, not rape!'

And on a lighter note, one woman with the reasoning: 'How the f**k am I supposed to open jars and lift heavy things without my husband?'

Loves cooking: This woman feels that feminists have a tendency to  'whine hysterically' until people 'buy' them stuff, and that children are considered punishment

Independent: The blog has triggered a storm of critics, largely women who do consider themselves feminists and feel the submitters (such as this woman) have got the concept of feminism wrong altogether

No victim: Plenty of submitters resent being considered 'weak' just because they are women

The blog prompted one feminist, writer Rebecca Brink, to respond with a slew of satirical posts.

'I don't need feminism because I want boys to like me,' reads one, while another states: 'I don't need feminism because the only way I think I can get along in this world is by pandering to the status quo and sh***ing on other women.'

'I don't need feminism because I'm a teenager who hasn't entered the workforce yet'

She also fed into the shared view of several others, that many of the Women Against Feminism submitters were simply too young to fully understand certain issues surrounding the concept.

'I don't need feminism because I'm a teenager who hasn't entered the workforce yet and I don't know what constant sexual harassment or watching unqualified people get promoted over me feels like,' Ms Brink posted.

True stories: This women says she was bullied by a female teacher for wanting to be a wife and mother, and feels feminism fuels such treatment

Body hair: While some submissions were rambling, others kept their views simple and to-the-point

Stigma: This woman says her brothers have been unfairly demonized all their lives for being male

Joanne Sandler, a feminist who has been working with women's right initiatives in more than 80 countries for over 40 years, spoke to MailOnline about her view on the Women Against Feminism blog.

'If the women "don't need" feminism 
because they have transcended gender discrimination... They've achieved a feminist utopia'

She said: 'If the women "don't need" feminism because they have transcended gender discrimination and inequality, more power to them... They've achieved a feminist utopia. That's good news!

'The fact that they understand feminism in a way that is different from my daily reality and understanding is something that I can live with.

'I hope they keep talking about feminism. We need the publicity. It will guarantee that feminism will still be there when and if they are interested.'

Easy: This woman doesn't need feminism, it appears, because it goes against chivalry

Not rape: It is not entirely clear why this woman chose to broadcast her message naked

In response to the backlash they have faced, Women Against Feminism issued the following statement on its Facebook page, which has amassed over 13,800 'likes' and counting: 'So feminists have been calling us lots of names lately.

'Basically they are saying, "You're too stupid to know what you want. You need us to tell you what's good for you. And if you try to get away, we will throw insults"... Are all feminists like this? No. Are a lot of them like this? Yes. Just look at how the "feminist media" has treated us this week.'

It may be a hot topic this week, but this is not a new debate. Girls creator Lena Dunham has previously weighed in on the subject, saying: 'So many women have come to this idea of it being anti-male - but what feminism is about is equality and human rights.'

Opinions differ: Lena Dunham (left) wants to ditch the 'anti-male' label from the feminist equation, Ellen Page (center) thinks we still live in a 'patriarchal society' and Lana Del Rey (right) thinks feminism is 'boring'

Actress Ellen Page thinks the battle for gender equality is far from won, stating: 'I don't know why people are so reluctant to say they're feminists. Could it be any more obvious that we still live in a patriarchal world when feminism is a bad word?'

And as for songstress Lana Del Rey, she's over the whole thing altogether. 'Whenever people bring up feminism, I'm like, god. I'm just not really that interested,' she said in a recent interview.

'For me, the issue of feminism is just not an interesting concept.'
