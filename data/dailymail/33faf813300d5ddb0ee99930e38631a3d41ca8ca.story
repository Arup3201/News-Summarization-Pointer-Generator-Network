More than 20 stolen dogs found inside a parked car with the windows up were seized by Hawaii police on Thursday night.

Waikiki resident Kat Linker discovered the 21 canines after hearing loud barking from a car parked at the Ala Wai Boat Harbor about 10.30pm.

'They [the dogs] were in cages. Some were 
running around. They were barking so loudly and all the windows were up.
It was completely steamed up. It was absolutely horrible and I knew 
there was something seriously wrong,' she said.

Cruel: Kat Linker opened the unlocked car door to find 21 small dogs crammed in cages at the back of a car. She said the stench was unbearable

Hawaii News Now reported Linker, with her boyfriend by her side, was shocked to see the animals inside the Honda Fit when she opened the door. The car was unlocked. 

Linker called police and left the car door open to give the canines, a Pomeranian-Poodle mix, fresh air.

'I
needed to give the dogs air. They were so suffocating in there and 
panting,' Linker said.

'When I opened the door, the stench that came out of that car 
was absolutely horrible. I felt so bad for the dogs.'

Distressing: Kat Linker heard barking and was shocked to see the dogs inside the car. 'Some [dogs] were running around. They were barking so loudly and all the windows were up,' she said

Off the hook: The 68-year-old female driver, center, had allegedly taken the dogs from her dog breeder daughter without permission. She has not been cited for animal cruelty

Conscientious: Kat Linker was walking past the car with her boyfriend when she heard barking

Hawaii News Now reported officers confiscated the 
canines when the driver, a 68-year-old unidentified woman, returned to the car.

While authorities opened an animal cruelty case against the woman, she was not cited.

The woman had reportedly taken the dogs from her daughter, a dog breeder, without permission.

It is not clear how long the dogs were left in the car or why the woman took the dogs. 

'I was 
surprised that the police let her go. I really thought they would take 
her to the station,'Linker said.

'I was surprised by that, but I was at least glad 
that they didn't let her drive away with the dogs.'

A Hawaiian Humane Society veterinarian who examined the dogs said they were in good condition.

The breeder was allegedly unaware of a law that prohibits more than 10 dogs per household.

The animals have been split up and the breeder's adult daughter will help care for some of them.

The dogs will also be microchipped and licensed.
