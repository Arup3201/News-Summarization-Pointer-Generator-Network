A dog rescued from the streets of Thailand overcame two life-threatening illnesses to be dubbed the 'happiest in the world' after her pictures won the hearts of more than 150,000 people.

Gluta has become an internet sensation since her now-owner Sorasart Wisetsin began posting pictures of his much-loved pet on social media sites.

But her happy disposition hides her traumatic past - which saw her rescued from the streets by Sorasart, before undergoing life-saving treatment for not one, but two deadly diseases.

Joyful: Gluta has won over a legion of fans - but her happy expression hides a difficult life

Rescued: Gluta was saved from the streets of Thailand by her now-owner Sorasart Wisetsin

Sick: But it soon became clear the young dog was not at all well - and she was taken to the vets

Infection: The vets found she had a condition called metritis, an inflammation of the uterus wall

Surgery: The condition can be fatal if not treated, so it was decided to remove Gluta's womb

Sorasart first met Gluta when he was staying in a dormitory in Thailand, explaining to her many fans she caught his attention because 'she really was so nice and so neat'.

But he wasn't allowed to keep Gluta in his dorm, so Sorasart would meet his companion in the car park outside to feed her.

It quickly became clear to him that his new friend was suffering from some medical issues, so he took the dog to the vets.

After tests and scans she was diagnosed with metritis, a bacterial infection which inflames the wall of the uterus.

If left untreated, it can lead to sterility and even death.

Happier times: For a period, it seemed like Gluta was on the road to recovery - but it was not to be

Cancer: She began to go downhill once more, and this time the vets discovered cancer cells in her cervix

Treatment: The canine was forced to undergo several rounds of chemotherapy and laser surgery

Ecstatic: Sorasart then began documenting the happy times he and his beloved pet were sharing

Fans: He set up a Facebook page, a Tumblr and an Instagram account - all dedicated to his pet

Thousands: And soon, the rest of the world came to love Gluta as much as Sorasart had come to

Hilarious: The funny snaps of Gluta have really struck a chord with people on the social media sites

It was decided it would be for the best if Gluta's uterus was removed and, for a while, the dog seemed to be on the mend.

But then she began to go downhill once more, and vets discovered this time she had cervical cancer.

This time, Gluta had to undergo laser surgeries and several rounds of chemotherapy. 

 But luckily, a year and a half later, she was given a clean bill of health. 

Cute: On Instagram, 11,000 people follow the day-to-day exploits of Gluta and Sorasart

Relief: Sorasart revealed 'her sad eyes turned to shine brightly with cheer like never before' once she recovered

Delight: From now on, Sorasart said, there will only be a smile on his canine companion's face

Adored: 'She has never disappointed me,' the proud owner said in a video documenting her life with him

Now the pair entertain hundreds of thousands of fans - posting hilarious pictures of the happy dog to Instagram and Facebook. 

Sorasart said: 'Her sad eyes turned to shine brightly with cheer like never before.

'From now on there will only be a smile on her face.'

Sorasart, who describes her as 'neat, clever and talented', added: 'She has never disappointed me.'
