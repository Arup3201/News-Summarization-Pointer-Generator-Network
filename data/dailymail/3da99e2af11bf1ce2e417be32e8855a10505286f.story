Shocked: Zoe Butler, 25, was allegedly called a 'tart' by estate agents

A woman has spoken of her distress after she was sent an email from her estate agent’s account in which she was called a ‘tart’.

Zoe Butler, 25, was contacted by KT Residential as she and boyfriend Orrin Duhaney, 21, searched for a flat in Surbiton, South-West London.

The email chain apparently shows a message from Daniel Dow to colleague Daniel Grove, which says: ‘Boss, want to do a l8 [late] viewing with this tart?’ This is followed by a lewd remark.

Miss Butler said: ‘It made me feel very small and upset. How often do they say that about potential tenants? 

'I kept thinking “Am I reading this right?” ’She sent a reply to the email, asking: ‘Do you generally talk about your potential tenants like this?’

A reply from Mr Grove’s email account said: ‘Not at all, it was an extremely immature and inappropriate comment made by my colleague on our internal system. 

I sincerely apologise for the comment and assure you that it was made as a baseless and inappropriate attempt at humour regarding my personal life.’

Mr Dow, 35, said: ‘As unbelievable as it would appear, we did not send any of these emails. We are looking at what has gone on, but all we can think of is there has been a sabotage attempt.’
