Paul Wellens is convinced that St Helens’ eight-year run without a Grand Final win will count for nothing when they face Wigan at Old Trafford on Saturday.

The 34-year-old is one of only two survivors — along with James Roby — from the club’s last victory in 2006, which was followed by five consecutive final defeats. But despite the bad run, Wellens is upbeat. 

The Saints skipper, who was raised in the town and has played for the club since he was 18, said: ‘If you’d told me in 2006 that we wouldn’t win another then I wouldn’t have believed it. We have no trouble in getting there because we have done it numerous times in the past.

‘When players come to Saints they have to realise that a club of this stature has expectations to be successful.

‘This is a very different group of players to the ones that played in those Grand Final defeats. We are confident, in great mood and looking forward to the challenge.’

Saints have lost three of their best players to injury this season — Jon Wilkin with a dislocated shoulder, Luke Walsh with a broken leg and Jonny Lomax with a knee injury and Wellens said people ‘were quick to write us off’. But he added: ‘It’s tested our resolve and we’ve passed with flying colours.’
