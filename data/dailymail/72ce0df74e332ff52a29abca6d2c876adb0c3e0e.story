One piggy went to market and this little piggy went 'nom, nom, nom' all the way home.

Hanna Balicki from Palm Beach, Florida, filmed the moment she treated a miniature porker to a dinner of potato chips.

Footage shows the snouted animal making a string of ecstatic squealing sounds as he snuffles up the salty snacks. 

As soon as a chip is put near his lips, the little hog quickly gobbles it up.

He then proceeds to oink and grunt at the top of his lungs. 

'Nom, nom, nom,' he seems to say, as he awaits another helping of nibbles.

Another chip is presented and the pig literally inhales it in a snap. He then whines away for more.

Although the clip was filmed in 2012 it has recently resurfaced.

Many viewers have commented on the pig's bizarre vocal range, while others have criticized his high-sodium diet.

Dinner is served: One piggy went to market and this little piggy went 'nom, nom, nom' all the way home
