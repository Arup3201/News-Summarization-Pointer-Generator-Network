London’s British Museum remains the most popular tourist destination in the UK, welcoming nearly seven million visitors last year as the country’s tourism boom continued.

The museum in Bloomsbury was tops out of more than 2,200 tourist sites represented by the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva).

Alva members saw a 6.5 per cent increase in visits in 2014 compared with 2013, thanks in part to Great War centenary commemorations, including the celebrated poppy display at the Tower of London, and the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

An estimated five million people viewed the display of 888,246 ceramic poppies at the Tower of London

The British Museum held on to its status as the UK's most popular attraction with nearly 6.7 million visits

Scottish attractions reported an increase of nearly 10 per cent, while the number of visitors to London sites increased by seven per cent.

Attractions in Northern Ireland reported a five per cent increase, while sites in Wales had an overall rise of just under six per cent. 

One of the most popular attractions in London proved to be the Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red installation at the Tower of London.

Its moat was filled with 888,246 ceramic poppies – representing the number of British and Commonwealth casualties in World War I – drawing an estimated five million people who viewed the display from outside the walls.

They contributed to a six per cent rise, to a little over three million, in annual visitors inside the Tower of London compared with 2013.

The Library of Birmingham was the 10th most popular attraction in Britain, with 2.4 million visits in 2014

Visits to the Imperial War Museum in Lambeth, London, which hosted new World War I galleries, soared 153 per cent to 914,774.

Outside the capital, there was a 50.9 per cent increase, to 340,929, in visits to the National Trust’s Dunham Massey in Cheshire, which recreated its Great War role as a military hospital.

In Scotland, the Commonwealth Games contributed to a four per cent increase, to more than 1.48 million, in visits to Edinburgh Castle, making it the most popular admission-paying attraction outside London.

Glasgow's Riverside Museum had a 41.8 per cent rise in visitors, while the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh welcomed 39 per cent more compared with 2013.

The British Museum held on to its status as the UK's most popular attraction with nearly 6.7 million visits, followed by the National Gallery in London, which was visited by nearly 6.42 million people, an increase of 6.4 per cent.

Figures for London's Southbank Centre have been included for the first time in the Alva table, with the complex welcoming more than 6.25 million visitors, securing it third place in the overall list.

The Library of Birmingham ranked 10th, with 2.4 million visitors.

Museums and galleries enjoyed a 6.09 per cent increase last year, while the new visitor centre at Stonehenge helped the Wiltshire monument to an 8.4 per cent rise to more than 1.34 million visits.

Alva director Bernard Donoghue said: ‘I am delighted that our members' figures are going from strength to strength.

‘Looking forward to our 2015 figures, we are confident that they will rise again with the anticipated increase in overseas visitors this year.’
