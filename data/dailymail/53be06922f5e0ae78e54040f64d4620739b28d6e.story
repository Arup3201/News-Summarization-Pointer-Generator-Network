A customer who popped out for a lunchtime snack got more greens than she bargained for after finding a dead frog in her salad.

The Wall Street Journal employee had visited the Pret a Manger on Sixth Avenue/47 Street in Manhattan yesterday to get what she assumed would be a regular Albacore Tuna Nicoise Salad.

But in addition to the tomatoes, tuna, egg and olives, there was an extra ingredient: the small amphibian, almost camouflaged among the salad leaves.

A Wall Street Journal employee found a dead frog in a Tuna Nicoise Salad she bought from a branch of Pret A Manger on Sixth Avenue/47 Street

Kathryn Lurie, digital features editor at the WSJ, posted a photo of the novel salad on behalf of her startled co-worker who bought the meal and did not wish to be identified.

Lurie told Gothamist that her colleague had started the meal at her desk and was 'pretty shaken' to discover the two-inch long green-brown creature.

A spokesman for Pret said: 'At Pret A Manger, we take issues like this very seriously.

'Our lettuce is sourced from farms that do not use any pesticides on its produce, therefore organic matter does very rarely manage to pass through our production process.

'We are currently looking into this issue to make every effort that this does not happen again.'

Ellen Roggemann, vice president of brand marketing for the company in the U.S., told the WSJ that the 'handmade natural food' sold by the chain is often made from organic ingredients.

The manager of the Pret branch in Manhattan (above) has since apologised and given the customer a refund, plus a voucher for a free lunch

She added that this could be partially to blame for the frog in the salad.

Ms Roggemann said: 'We don’t use any pesticides with our greens and they go through multiple washing cycles. An unfortunate piece of organic matter has made its way through.'

The manager of the branch has since apologised and given the customer a refund, plus a voucher for a free lunch.

And as for the frog: it lives on, as it were, in meme form - including one showing the poor little critter wearing a festive woolly hat.

... and here's a live one in a bag

Last September, a woman discovered a live frog in a bag of washed salad she bought 
from a high-end supermarket.

Christina
 Carrington, 50, had already eaten some of the salad leaves before her 
youngest daughter, Daniela Toale, noticed the amphibian lurking in the 
bag.

The frog was found in a bag of mixed leaf salad bought from a branch of Waitrose in Southampton

The frog had survived despite being trapped in the plastic packaging for more than 24 hours.

Mrs Carrington, a health care 
manager from Chandler’s Ford near Southampton, Hampshire, bought the 
mixed leaf bag from her local branch of Waitrose.

She
 ate some of the leaves for her lunch, but the green and brown frog was 
only spotted when Miss Toale, a 20-year-old university student, prepared
 dinner that evening.
