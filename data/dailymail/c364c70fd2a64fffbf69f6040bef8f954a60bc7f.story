Cautioned: Koree Britton, 22, pictured in his England Under-20 kit, has been formally cautioned by police for voyeurism

An upcoming England rugby star has been cautioned by police after filming a woman as she undressed in a swimming pool changing room.

Rugby Union player Koree Britton, 22, was caught when the woman spotted her reflection on a camera phone being held underneath her cubicle door in the unisex changing room.

The distressed woman alerted staff and police were called to the scene at the leisure@Cheltenham centre in Gloucestershire at 8.40pm on March 31.

Officers then inspected Britton's phone and he was detained. The sportsman, who plays for Gloucester Rugby, was later let go after accepting a formal caution for voyeurism.

A Gloucestershire Police spokesman 
said: 'Police were called to a report of a male taking a photograph or 
video of a woman getting changed in a cubicle.

'The report was that he had taken a photo or video underneath the cubicle using a mobile phone.

'A 22-year-old man from Gloucester has been cautioned for voyeurism.

'It
 was deemed appropriate to give him a formal caution. That may be 
because he was remorseful, or had not committed any previous offences.'

According
 to an unnamed source, the unsuspecting woman only realised she was 
being filmed when she bent down to pick up her shampoo.

They said: 'The leisure centre has communal changing areas with cubicles that are open at the bottom.

'A woman bend down to pick up some shampoo and saw her reflection on a phone.

'She started hammering down the door on the cubicle next to her but the person inside wouldn't come out.

'The police were called and he was arrested.'

A spokesman for Gloucester Rugby Club confirmed they were aware of the incident.

He said: 'The club has started an internal investigation into the matter and will not be making any further comment.'

Britton joined the Premiership rugby union team as a hooker in 2012 and signed a two year extension in April 2013 to stay on at the club until the end of the 2014-2015 season.

He was a key member of the England side that won the 2012 U20 Six Nations title and scored the only try in England's 7th place play-off against Australia at the 2012 Junior World Championships in South Africa.

He made his Aviva Premiership debut for Gloucester in September 2012 and has played a number of times this season, including a start against Biarritz in the Amlin Cup Quarter Final tie.

In April 2013, it was announced he had signed a contract extension that will see him staying at Kingsholm for the foreseeable future.

No-one was available for comment at Britton's redbrick detached home in Quedgeley, Gloucestershire.

Stephen Petherick, general manager at leisure@cheltenham, said: 'We take public safety very seriously and staff are vigilant in monitoring activities.

'We encourage customers to report anything suspicious and will act swiftly to confront anyone who breaches our security policies.

'We are pleased to work closely with the police to ensure that matters are investigated and resolved as quickly as possible.'
