The shape, evolution and lifespan of comet 67P-Churyumov/Gerasimenko have been revealed in a series of groundbreaking papers.

Using data from the Rosetta spacecraft, which is in orbit around the comet, scientists have revealed that the comet’s interior is ‘fluffy’.

Among the other discoveries they found that the comet's neck may have been 'eaten away' over time, rather than being the result of two smaller bodies merging together.

Papers on Rosetta's comet (pictured) are to be published in the journal science tomorrow. They were co-authored by scientists from the University of Maryland, US. A new theory suggests its 'neck' may have been eaten away like the core of an apple (outgassing shown here) to give it its odd shape

Several papers detailing the latest findings, and co-authored by University of Maryland scientists, will appear in a special issue of the journal Science tomorrow.

Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) is showing signs of waking up early as it streaks towards the Sun at almost 47,800 mph (76,900 km/h).

As it approaches the sun, the rubber duck-shaped lump of ice, dust and rock is expected to heat up and release more gas and water vapour from its interior.

Comets are most active when they reach perihelion, the point in their orbit when they are closest to the Sun.

But even at a distance of more than 200 million miles (320 million km), comet 67P is beginning to stir in dramatic fashion.

Dr Dennis Bodewits, from the University of Maryland, US, who led one of several teams reporting latest findings from the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission in the journal Science, said: 'We are already seeing more activity.

'Jets are sprouting up everywhere. We've been surprised to see how active it is. It already has more jets than many other comets do at perihelion.'

From the data, Dr Holger Sierks from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research told MailOnline that they now had a greater understanding of the comet's interior.

He said the interior is now thought to be analogous to 'ash, cigarette ash or super-dry powder snow.'

One of the papers used images from Rosetta’s Osiris (Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System) camera to analyse the structure of the comet.

They found that most of the ‘outgassing’ activity of the comet was occurring at the neck, which connects the two larger lobes and gives it its ‘rubber duck’ appearance.

It raises questions as to whether the comet is a combination of two smaller bodies, or began as one larger one that shrank around the middle, like an apple beating eaten around its core.

'With the different instruments on Rosetta we hope to find out how much ice the nucleus of 67P contains, how deep below the surface it is buried, and what the composition of this ice is,' Dr Dennis Bodewits from the University of Maryland, who was involved in the research, told MailOnline. 

'This then will help us understand the comet's aging.

'This ties directly into one of the main questions we're looking at now: was the comet formed in this strange shape, or is erosion responsible for "eating away" the comet's middle?'

Rosetta (illustratino shown) entered orbit around the comet on 6 August 2014 and, in November, it released the Philae lander towards the comet to return data from the surface. Rosetta is continuing to follow the comet, with closest approach to the sun scheduled for 13 August this year

A second paper has detailed the surface of the comet that is currently visible to Rosetta, raising textures and features on its surface.

This could help the team work out how the shape of the comet has evolved over time, and where also the largest deposits of water and ice might reside.

Currently only one side of the comet is visible, the 'northern' side, as the other is facing away from the sun and is thus shrouded in darkness.

The makes up more than half the comet's total surface and is divided into 19 distinct regions, all named after ancient Egyptian deities. 

A third paper combines data from OSIRIS and another instrument, the Grain Impact Analyzer and Dust Accumulator (Giada).

This study looks at the comet's coma - the thick cloud of dust and gas that envelops the nucleus.

As the comet gets closer to the sun, the coma grows more massive as the nucleus heats up and loses more material.

The comet has also been found to be darker than coal in images taken by Rosetta, making other objects like the moon and Earth (shown in composite image) considerably brighter

By measuring the activity in the coma, including changes in the ratio of dust to gas, the team should be able to estimate how quickly the comet is outgassing and losing mass.

In so doing, the team hopes to learn more about how comets evolve. 

‘Because comets have very little gravity, dust and gas flow freely into space,’ said Dr Bodewits.

‘But we were surprised to find a cloud of particles orbiting the comet that are large and heavy enough to defy the sun's radiation pressure.’

The team was able to make this discovery thanks to Osiris' very sensitive cameras.

‘Each pixel is about 30 centimeters [11.2 inches],’ he continued. ‘You couldn't see a coffee cup, but you could see a large lunchbox. The resolution is about 10 times higher than Google Earth.’

Currently only one side of the comet is visible, the 'northern' side, as the other is facing away from the sun and is thus shrouded in darkness. The makes up more than half the comet's total surface and is divided into 19 distinct regions, all named after ancient Egyptian deities (shown)

A fourth paper described evidence for carbon-based molecules on the comet’s surface, gathered by Rosetta's Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (Virtis) instrument.

Based on past comet studies, the team expected to see signatures of slightly more complex molecules such as alcohols, carboxylic acids and nitrogen-containing amines.

However, the evidence from Virtis suggests that the comet's surface is instead dominated by simpler hydrocarbons.

The discovery could have implications for our understanding of how carbon-based molecules first developed and spread through our solar system.

Scientists will be increasingly excited later this year, when the comet reaches its closest point to the sun on 13 August.

At this point it will be most active, with new features and increased outgassing expected to be visible.
