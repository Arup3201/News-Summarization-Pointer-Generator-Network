CNN's chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta has come out in favor of marijuana – a turn around on his former stance – and says the American people have been ‘systematically misled’ on the dangers of the drug.

Dr Gupta, named one of People magazine's sexiest men alive in 2003, has revealed he changed his mind after working on a forthcoming documentary (‘Weeds’) and he apologized for his own role in the misinformation.

‘We have been terribly and systematically misled for nearly 70 years in the United States, and I apologize for my own role in that,’ he wrote on CNN.com.

Gupta also revealed his turnaround in a special edition of Piers Morgan's CNN show on Wednesday night. In the program both men admitted that they has tried the demon weed, although Gupta said he didn’t care for it.

After traveled around world over the past year to interview medical leaders, experts, growers and patients on the topic Gupta described has findings as ‘stunning’.

Prior to his recent research, Gupta said he had been unimpressed by the case typically made for medical marijuana.

‘I mistakenly believed the Drug Enforcement Agency listed marijuana as a schedule 1 substance because of sound scientific proof,’ he wrote.

Gupta claims that the Drug Enforcement Agency 'doesn't have the science' to lump marijuana as a schedule 1 substance, the most dangerous category

Here's what Gupta has to say now about cannabis after his recent research...

...but back in 2009 when he was very staunchly against legalizing it...

He now claims that they 'don’t have the science' to lump marijuana is in the category of the most dangerous drugs.

The shift in stance marks quite a turnaround for Gupta who in 2009 wrote an article in TIME magazine entitled ‘Why I would Vote No on Pot.’

At that time he claimed many people in favor of legalizing the drug simply wanted to get stoned.

'As a doctor, smoking the stuff is not going to do your health any good,' he concluded at the time.

Now he says it doesn't have a high potential for abuse, and there are very legitimate medical applications for the drug.

In researching his documentary he said he was ‘unsettled’ by the lack of science in Assistant Secretary of Health Dr. Roger Egeberg’s recommendation in 1970 that marijuana should be classified as a schedule 1 substance.

Gupta pointed out that while marijuana leads to dependence in about 10 percent of adult users, that is half the rate of dependence amongst cocaine users, which is only a schedule 2 substance ‘with less abuse potential than schedule 1 drugs.’

Around 25 percent of heroin users become addicted, while 30 percent of smokers become addicted and many go on to die as a result.

However he did issue a note of caution about teenagers using the drug.

Young, developing brains are likely more susceptible to harm from marijuana than adult brains, he said.

He cited recent studies which suggest regular use in teenage years can lead to a permanent decrease in IQ, while other research has hinted at a possible heightened risk of developing psychosis.

‘Much in the same way I wouldn't let my own children drink alcohol, I wouldn't permit marijuana until they are adults,’ he wrote.

‘If they are adamant about trying marijuana, I will urge them to wait until they're in their mid-20s when their brains are fully developed.’

Now that Gupta has seen the light on the positive medical benefits of the drug, he promises to do his part to help and 'genuinely and honestly' try to fill the remaining void in our knowledge about the drug.
