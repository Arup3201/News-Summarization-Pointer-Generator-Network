Olympic champion Laura Trott set aside her anxiety to win the first of six disciplines in the women's omnium on day two of the Track Cycling World Cup in London.

Trott, who won two gold medals at the London 2012 Games, was part of the women's team pursuit-winning quartet on day one and returned on Saturday morning to the arena after expressing nerves about the omnium.

The 22-year-old from Cheshunt won all six disciplines the last time she did an omnium at the Olympic Velodrome - in the October Revolution event - and made a supreme start in the scratch race.

Trott appeared to be boxed in as the 40-lap (10 kilometres) race was reaching its climax but a gap opened up as Kirsten Wild made her bid for the line and the Briton took her opportunity, rounding the Dutchwoman to win.

Britons Jess Varnish and Vicky Williamson qualified in 11th and 12th place, out of 24, in the women's sprint competition.

The flying 200 metres ranked the riders, with Varnish drawn against Russian Olga Streltsova and Williamson versus Olga Ismayilova in the first round.

Varnish won comfortably to advance to the second round, but Williamson was beaten to fall into the repechage, giving her a second chance to progress.
