When a $250,000 Rupert Bunny artwork went missing from Albert Watt's Victorian home - little did he know it was the work of a man who used to live right next door.

Not only did thief Peter Rand not arouse Mr Watt's suspicions because they where once neighbours, but because the pair were the closest of friends. They had known one another for 40 years.

But despite this long-held friendship, Mr Rand, it was revealed in a Victorian court hearing in 2011, was the mastermind behind the theft of the missing work he took from Mr Watt's home in 1991.

Mystery: The missing artwork which was taken from Albert Watt's home in 1991 by a friend who he had known for more than 40 years

The case sparked a lengthy police investigation, and one by Mr Watt's two nephews and original heirs to the artwork that they would have inherited when their uncle died in 1993.

They even hired a private investigator to track it down - to no avail.

Over the years they were never able to trace its whereabouts - until 2010, when its new, unsuspecting owner had it valued and exhibited at the  National Gallery of Victoria.

Having known about the missing piece of rare art, the gallery tipped off police which led them to the home of Mr Rand's lawyer, Frank Levy, who had the painting left to him by his client when he died in 1997.

Without any knowledge of its theft, Mr Levy had the painting hanging in his home for more than 10 years.

Born Rupert Charles Wulsten Bunny, the Australian painter achieved success and critical acclaim for a number of his works, including the missing piece Girl In Sunlight

But upon receiving the tip-off, police seized the work and returned it to its rightful owners, the nephews of Albert Watt.

A relieved Michael Watt told the Age Newspaper in 2010: 'My brother and I were both very happy to discover the painting was in Melbourne after all these years,''

But Mr Levy wasn't satisfied that they were in fact the rightful owners. He launched legal action a year later claiming that he had a right to the work he had inherited and hung in his home for more than a decade.

He claimed any rights the Watt family had to the painting expired under the statute of limitations.

From the court documents in that matter, details of the Girl in Sunlight saga can be revealed.

Tip-off: Workers at the National Gallery of Victoria tipped police off about the stolen artwork when it was exhibited there during a retrospective exhibition on Rupert Bunny's work

According to the statement lodged in court in 2011 by both Watt brothers, from 1953 until 1961 their father and Mr Rand were neighbours in an apartment block in South Yarra, and Mr Rand ''was a regular visitor.''The painting was prominently displayed in the apartment,' Michael Watt states. 'Rand was a friend and knew of the [my father's] ownership of, and affection for, the painting.''In the early 1960s, the two men moved again within South Yarra, and lived just a few doors down from each other in Domain Road.

And their friendship continued further when Mr Watt relocated to the 1970s, to his knew home where the Bunny painting was 'prominently displayed' in his dining room.For the past three years, the case has been before the Supreme Court. Last week Mr Levy finally lost his appeal.Twenty-three years after Girl in Sunlight disappeared, the painting is once again with Mr Watt's heirs.
