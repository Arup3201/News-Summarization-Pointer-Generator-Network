A young father-to-be was crushed to death after a parking barrier swung into his car, just hours after he had told his family he was expecting his first child with his girlfriend. 

Will Page, described as a 'car fanatic' by his family, was driving out of an industrial estate in Ilkeston in Derbyshire when a parking barrier swung into the windscreen of his van, trapping him and crushing him to death. 

The 22-year-old apprentice engineer had been repairing a car on the industrial estate when the accident happened on Saturday.

His girlfriend Rachael Cross, and mother of their unborn child, described him as 'just amazing' and said it was a 'dream' for her partner to become a father.

Just hours earlier on the previous day Mr Page had been celebrating with his family after he revealed that his 21-year-old girlfriend Rachael Cross was eight weeks pregnant with their first child. She was due to have her first scan yesterday.

Mr Page's father Brian said: 'One minute he was telling everyone he was having a baby and over the moon - and the next this happened.

'He loved kids and being a father was everything he wanted. Everyone said he would have been a great dad.' 

Mr Page frequently met up with other car fanatics at Wyvern retail park in Derby during the weekends.

On Sunday evening about 90 cars took part in a procession past his Derbyshire home and beeped their horns in his honour before gathering at the retail park, writing messages to put in lanterns and releasing them into the sky.

His father added: 'From front to back, the cars went on for two-and-a-half miles. I stood outside and watched them all come past. He would have been over the moon with that.

'It was truly astounding and so emotional. It made me feel so much better because he was loved by so many.

'Will was such a happy-go-lucky child, right up to his death, forever smiling and laughing.

'He was the typical joker type of lad and would do anything to cheer people up.

'You couldn't find a better son, mate, brother or leader - he was well-thought-of by so many people.'

On Monday Miss Cross posted an image of her eight week scan on Facebook and said their 'little fighter has a strong heartbeat, even after all this stress.' 

Miss Cross said she had paid for the private scan so that the image could be buried with her partner. 

She said: 'He was absolutely amazing and I just loved him so much. 

'It was a complete dream for him to be a dad and obviously I'm still going to make that happen. 

'He was just so happy and never put a downer on your day. I keep expecting him to walk through the door and say 'what's everyone moping about for?'''

The couple met in 2013 over their mutual love of cars and have been living with Mr Page's father but saving up to buy their own home. 

Miss Cross added: 'He was brilliant with kids and would have been a great dad. 

Mr Page's father said the young apprentice engineer was a car fanatic and would have been a good father 

Miss Cross shared a picture of her eight week scan on Facebook on Monday - two days after Mr Page died 

'We spoke about becoming a family one day and when he found out I was pregnant he was absolutely over the moon.' 

She said the last thing her boyfriend had told her was that he loved her. 

'We hadn't been trying for a baby but we had talked about it,' said Miss Cross.

'Will just said if it happens it happens and when I found out I was pregnant he was delighted and it felt like it was meant to be. On the Saturday morning when the accident happened he'd left me in bed at eight o'clock while he went off to do up his car.

'His last words to me were 'love you, bye' and off he went.. That was the last time I saw him. I was having a lie in and I got a call from one of his friends at about 11am saying Will had been in an accident.

'To be honest I just laughed because he was always playing jokes on me pretending he'd cut his finger off at work and I thought it was another prank. When his friend told me he was serious I rushed down to the scene but it was too late. The paramedics were doing CPR on him but he'd passed away.

'He'd been going in and out of the industrial unit all morning. The barrier was one where you're supposed to bolt it back when you go through but Will hadn't done that. When he came out of the unit to get another part for the car a big gust of wind blew the barrier and it went straight through the windscreen.

'There was nothing anyone could do.' 

Mr Page had been carrying out repairs on his Peugeot 106 GTI when the accident took place. He had been in a work van and was driving out of the site when the barrier crashed through the windscreen, trapping him in the vehicle and crushing him.

Firefighters, police, paramedics and the air ambulance were called to the scene, but Mr Page was pronounced dead at 11.15am.

The Health and Safety Executive is investigating how the accident took place.

Mr Page has two brothers - Callum, 25, and Harry, 18 - as well as 27-year-old sister Laura.

His friend Lee Harris, 28, of Ilkeston, worked with him for about five years at A&D Plastics in Digby Business Park.

He said: 'It is not something you expect to hear. When I found out he had been involved in an incident, I walked up there thinking he had broken his leg. You do not think the worst.

'It was when I found out he was trapped that I realised it was bad. He was a great lad, I always got on with him and he one of those people you bond with through work. My brother Daniel was his best mate. They did everything together; fishing and holidays.'

Dave Harris, who knew the apprentice through his nephew Lee and working with him at A&D Plastics, said he was often known by the nickname 'little Will.' 

He told the Nottingham Post: 'He was always mucking about with his cars - he was really into his cars.

'We called him little Will because he was so small until he was about 16 and then he sprouted up.'

Andy Wilmott, managing director of WB Power Services where the 22-year-old worked, said: 'He was a lovely lad and everyone here is absolutely devastated.

Flowers have been left by friends and relatives at the scene (left) where Mr Page (right) died on Saturday 

'He was a trustworthy guy and very infectious. He had a lot of friends here and a lot of people liked him.' 

A spokeswoman from the Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Rutland Air Ambulance confirmed Mr Page died at the scene after suffering chest injuries. 

She said: 'We are not sure how it happened. The barrier went through the windshield and crushed him.'

A man who works at the garage where Will was repairing his car said: 'We're not entirely sure what's happened but he was driving out when he was hit by the barrier.

'It might have been the wind that caught the barrier and swung it into his van.'

A fundraising page has been set up to raise money for Mr Page's funeral and has already raised £2,400 in his memory in just two days.
