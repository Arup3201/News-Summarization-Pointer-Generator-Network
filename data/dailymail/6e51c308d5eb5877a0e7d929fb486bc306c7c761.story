Frank Lampard offered a sliver of encouragement to England supporters with a glowing review on the talent and application of the young players in Roy Hodgson’s World Cup squad.

A goalless draw against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte brought to a sorry end the group phase for England the squad fly home having finished with only one point and two goals, rock bottom of Group D.

It has been a miserable tournament but Hodgson needs all the hope he can find when he reflects on what went wrong and it may exist in the progress of Luke Shaw, Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley.

'There are no big heads among the kids who have come through,' said Lampard. 'They are impressive. No kids are coming in and thinking they can stroll about. They are trying to do the right things even though we have not got out of the group.

'They have applied themselves, trained well and showed glimpses at times. The disappointing thing is that the team has not done it. We need to improve otherwise we would not be going home. It is about the future and looking for them to get better.

'The manager will want to bring players through and if they perform they will get their chances. They certainly have quality. It is down to them. If they perform for their clubs they will get there.'

Lampard captained a young team against Costa Rica, winning his 106th and what is expected to be his final England cap.

The 36-year-old lingered at the end of the game with Hodgson and the rest of the squad to salute the fans in one corner of the Mineirao Stadium.

'It was absolutely amazing,' said Lampard.
 'It’s good for the young lads to see that they are backing the manager 
and singing for him. They can see the squad is young and the young 
players will benefit from this bad experience.

'Let’s
 not forget we have been knocked out very early, but if the fans stick 
with the younger players and encourage them, they will help.

'It made you proud to be an Englishman playing for the country with fans like that. And it makes you feel a bit bad we have not given them a longer stay.

'It was the end of a disappointing tournament, obviously. We should have won the game. We had the chances. We played some nice stuff, in bits.

'It was a difficult game to approach and I thought we did as well as we could. It was a shame not to get the win to take home.'

Lampard confirmed ahead of the World Cup that he intends to leave Chelsea. He has yet to announce his intended destination, although New York City in the MLS are the favourites to sign him on a free transfer.

'I will go home and think about,' said Lampard. 'I will decide when I get back, but I have a good idea.'
