A Texas magazine has published a cover emblazoned with the words 'Taste Of Africa Comes To Dallas!' - just days before a Liberian man became America's first Ebola case in the state.

The unfortunate Dallas Weekly front cover, published online on September 25, featured a map of Africa over a Texas flag with the attention-grabbing headline.

The ill-timed cover was designed and published prior to the news last week that Liberian national Thomas Duncan, who arrived in Texas on September 20, had become the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on American soil.

The Dallas Weekly front cover was published on September 25 - just days before the city announced that the U.S. first Ebola case was being treated - a man who had traveled to Texas from Liberia in West Africa 

However the magazine's Twitter account continued to tweet pictures of the front cover as late as October 3. 

The publication is described as the 'No.1 serving the African-American community' in the North Texas area and has been in circulation for more than 55 years. 

Mr Duncan has been hospitalized at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital since September 28 with his condition downgraded to critical on Saturday. 

The Ebola patient arrived in Dallas on September 20 and fell ill on September 23. He was initially sent home from Texas Presbyterian with antibiotics before being rushed back to the medical facility on September 28.  

Officials said ten people definitely had close contact with Duncan and a further 38 may have been around him when he was showing symptoms of the disease. 

Mr Duncan was staying with his girlfriend Louise Troh at a Dallas apartment when he became ill. On Friday a hazardous-materials crew hauled out items from the apartment in industrial barrels for permanent disposal.

The Dallas Weekly tweeted its unfortunate front cover on October 3 following the news that the city was treating the U.S. first Ebola patient - who had arrived from Liberia in West Africa
