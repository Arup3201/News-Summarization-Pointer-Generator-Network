Dog owners will often swear that their four-legged friend understands exactly how they feel.

And now researchers have suggested that far from reading too much into their pet’s actions, they may well be right.

Not only do dogs yawn when humans do, they are much more likely to do so if that person is their master.

A new study shows how the irresistible impulse to yawn can even spread between humans and their dogs. According to researchers in Japan this could be an indication of empathy

Two cameras were used to record dogs' responses during the testing sessions. Owners called their dogs by name and then yawned, or made a yawning movement, after making eye contact

Scientists say this behaviour reveals 
that dogs have a human-like ability to show empathy – the capacity to 
identify with another’s feeling.

Lead researcher Dr Teresa Romero said:
‘Our study suggests that contagious yawning in dogs is emotionally 
connected in a way similar to humans.

‘Although our study cannot determine 
the exact underlying mechanism operative in dogs, the subjects’ 
physiological measures taken during the study allowed us to counter the 
alternative hypothesis of yawning as a distress response.’

For the study, published in the 
journal Public Library of Science ONE, the Japanese team from the 
University of Tokyo recruited 25 dogs and their owners.

Dogs watched their owner, or a stranger, yawn or mimic yawning mouth movements, while having their heart rate monitored.

The researchers found that the dogs yawned significantly more in response to their owners’ actions than to the strangers’.

Dogs were much more likely to yawn in response to their owner yawning than the actions of a stranger. The dogs were also far more sensitive to genuine yawns

The dogs' heart rates were monitored using a device strapped to their chests during the testing

They were also far more sensitive to genuine yawns, and yawned significantly less often after seeing fake movements.

One possible explanation for the 
behaviour is that it is a tension-releasing reaction to mild stress. But
the animals were found to have maintained a constant heartbeat during 
the test which, combined with their heightened response to their owners’
actions, suggests they are reflecting their master’s feelings.

In non-human primates, the phenomenon of contagious yawning has been observed in chimpanzees, bonobos, and gelada baboons

The researchers concluded: ‘Our 
findings are consistent with the view that contagious yawning ... may 
indicate that rudimentary forms of empathy could be present in 
domesticated dogs.’ During the testing sessions two cameras were used to
record the dogs’ responses.

Owners called their dogs by name, made eye contact with them and then yawned or made a yawning movement.

Four test sessions lasting five 
minutes were conducted, involving either a real or fake yawn by an owner
or a stranger. At the same time, the dogs’ heart rates were monitored 
using a device strapped to their chests.

In the human world it is known that contagious yawning affects around half of all adults, yet the causes remain unclear.

Among animals, the phenomenon has been observed not only in dogs but also in chimpanzees, bonobo monkeys, and gelada baboons.

And like humans, they are more 
responsive to yawns from individuals with whom they have close social 
bonds. A study earlier this year also found that dogs really can see 
things from a human perspective – and that it influences their decision 
making.

Researchers discovered that when a 
person forbids a dog from taking food, they are more than twice as 
likely to disobey in a dark room than a lit room.

The study suggest man’s best friend first considers what a person is able to see, before choosing whether to break the rules.
