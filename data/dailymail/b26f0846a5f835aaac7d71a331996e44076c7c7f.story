Grandmother Ann Egan jokingly threatened to shoot rail workers who kept her awake over Christmas - but then got a visit from the police

A grandmother who jokingly threatened to shoot railway workers who had kept her awake for two days over Christmas was shocked when police turned up on her doorstep to investigate her ‘threat’.

Disabled Ann Egan, 57, who suffers from a lung condition and relies on an oxygen mask, made the comments when her partner was on the phone to Network Rail, complaining about the work taking place on a line behind their home.

Engineers had arrived without warning at 10pm on Christmas Eve and worked through until 8am on Christmas morning. They did the same on Christmas night, finishing at 8am on Boxing Day. 

Later that day, Miss Egan’s partner Dave Bumstead, also 57, called Network Rail to complain. Miss Egan said she was ‘shattered’ and ‘wound up’ when she said in the background: ‘If they come back again I’ll shoot them with a gun’.

Two hours later, two uniformed officers from British Transport Police knocked on the door of their home in Rainham, Kent, to investigate a threat of violence to railway staff. They went to the couple’s home following a complaint by Network Rail.

Miss Egan said the officers quickly realised she posed no risk and left after apologising for bothering her.

‘Obviously I was joking,’ she said. ‘It was totally tongue in cheek and I think anybody with a bit of common sense would realise that.

‘I could hear the woman from customer services getting really snotty on the phone and after two sleepless nights it really wound me up.

‘There were two officers on my doorstep and they took one look at me and knew it was ridiculous.

‘They were chuckling about it. They thought it was ridiculous too but they have to come and check it out. I think they just took one look at me and realised it was said in frustration. I was shattered.’ 

She added: ‘I can’t even run down the garden let alone climb a wall and gun down some rail workers.

‘Network Rail have totally wasted police time. It was a waste of my time and a waste of their time.’

Miss Egan said the work on the tracks behind her home had ruined her Christmas. Network Rail apologised for not warning residents in advance that work would be taking place but would not comment on the police matter.

Miss Egan said: ‘When you’ve got about twelve men shouting at the top of their voices and a disc cutter going all night and flood lights beaming into your window it is annoying.

‘I went to bed at midnight on Christmas Eve after getting everything ready for the next day.

‘I did not sleep for two nights and we had no letter or warning that the work would take place, no one in the street did.

‘It totally ruined my Christmas. I was shattered for the entire time.’

A Network Rail spokesman said: ‘Clearly our neighbour in Rainham should have received advanced warning of the work over Christmas and I can only apologise.

‘We are investigating how this came to happen and we know how important it is to let people know when we will be doing work overnight. Christmas is the busiest time of year for our engineers as it is the only time when we can get access to the busiest parts of the railway without impacting passengers.’

A British Transport Police spokesman said: ‘Officers had cause to visit an address in Rainham on Boxing Day, after a threat of violence with a gun towards rail workers was overheard. We take all abuse and threats of violence against rail staff very seriously and will investigate as appropriate.

‘In this case, we were satisfied the threat was made out of frustration, with no actual malice intended. There was no gun.

‘However, rail staff have the right to carry out their work without fear of intimidation.’
