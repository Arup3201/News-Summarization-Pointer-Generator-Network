Arsenal's French full back Mathieu Debuchy could be out until Christmas after suffering ankle ligament damage against Manchester City last weekend.

Manager Arsene Wenger revealed that Debuchy will undergo an exploratory operation on his ankle injury on Friday evening which will determine how long he is out for.

If he does not need further surgery, it will be six weeks before his return, but if he needs to go under the knife it will rule him out for at least three months.
