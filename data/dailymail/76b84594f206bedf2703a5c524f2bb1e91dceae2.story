Here you have it, folks - Kansas City's finest.

A police officer in Smithville decided to do a little dance at the front of his cop car recently in order to check whether his new dash cam was recording properly.

And now his colleagues have shared the video on their department's Facebook page for all the world to see.

Getting into the groove: This cop in Smithville, Missouri, is on his way to internet stardom after a dash cam video of him dancing was released by his colleagues online

Breaking it down: The officer is seen in the clip 'shaking it off' and snapping his fingers

There is plenty of finger-clicking and booty-shaking.
