Lord Prescott said Ed Miliband had to set out a 'very clear idea' and a 'vision' about what he wanted to achieve as Labour leader

Former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott has hit out at Ed
Miliband demanding he produce concrete policy proposals.

The party stalwart also questioned the 'character' of the new generation of Labour MPs.

Ramping up pressure on the Labour leader, he said Mr Miliband's attempts to appear strong by seeking a
confrontation with the unions were 'not enough' and he needed to put
forward a 'coherent' agenda.

Lord Prescott said Mr Miliband had to set out a 'very
clear idea' and a 'vision' about what he wanted to achieve as
Labour leader.

He is the latest senior party figure to criticise Mr Miliband over his low-key leadership style and lack of policies.

Former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith this week likened Labour’s policy process to a ‘pregnant panda’.

In a typically forthright interview with Total Politics
magazine, Lord Prescott dismissed suggestions that Labour was holding back
policies to prevent other parties stealing them, saying: 'Sometimes I
think that's a cover because we might not have thought what the f***ing best
alternative is, but anyway ... see the real problem now is there's got to be
coherence.'

He said it was getting 'bloody close' to the stage
where Mr Miliband would have to set out the policies to back up his One Nation
agenda.

Lord Prescott said: 'He's called "weak, weak, weak" every
day, every minister going on television, but as soon he gets into the scrap
with the unions it becomes 'strong, strong, strong'.

'But what about your policies? What are you doing about
that?'

He compared the battle to that fought by John Smith to
reform the party, saying it resulted in 'the perception of the leader ...
is he's become strong'.

'That is exactly what has happened to Ed Miliband at
the moment, but it's not enough, you really have to have a very clear idea, a
vision of what you're going to do.

'That's about campaigning, about drawing the
differences, and not being buffeted about by the problems that come from a
government who have chosen a different set of priorities.

'It's not only to say 'we vote against' - you need to
put that into a coherent policy. Our campaigning has to remind people...
traditional values in a modern setting. You have to deliver change but
connected to your principles and beliefs.

'Because the belief of the Tories is just money, money
money, it always was. If we talk about whether we want to be different to the
Tories you better find some framework in which we achieve it.'

Lord Prescott, a former trade union official, compared his
background to that of Labour's current MPs who had been 'researchers,
things like that'.

He said: 'The party is moving on, it's a different
system, and it's producing different people. There's less to pick from. There's
not many of them coming out now.

'Most of them have been to university. Well, fine,
great, they've got more brains but I'm not sure about the character.

'You've got
to have a message and a vision and a leader that feels they are taking that on
and believe in it. In politics, character is still part of it.'

Another former deputy Labour leader, Lord Hattersley, told
the magazine: 'We're very much into the politics of personality, the
politics of instant response, the politics of gimmick rather than principles.

'The Labour Party needs to demonstrate what it stands
for. When I was a young man, it was clear what it stood for: there was a large
army of the poor, there were masses of houses that needed to be built, and
there wasn't a health service.

'The Labour Party could say these things are so obvious
that we don't need to set out our ideology. Now it's more complicated. Society
has changed, and we need a firm ideological question because people don't know
what we stand for.

'The most damning question asked of Tony Blair during
his premiership was [David] Cameron saying to him: "Well, what is the
Labour Party for?" Ed can answer that question, and must go on answering
it very loudly and very clearly.'

He praised Mr Miliband for making the party 'more
socialist than it was three years ago', saying 'the Labour Party is
moving in the right direction'.
