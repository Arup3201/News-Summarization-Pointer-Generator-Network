The cities with the highest rate of same-sex couples raising children in the U.S. today have been revealed - and they're probably where you least expected.

Salt Lake City has been named the leading metropolitan area for same-sex couples raising children according to a report out of UCLA that identified one out of every four couples having at least one child.

Perhaps more shocking, the figures presented by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law this week found that the majority of same-sex parents are raising their children in more conservative areas of the country.

Ranking: Salt Lake City has been named the largest metro area for same-sex couples in the country having 26 percent, with Grand Forks, North Dakota showing 65 percent among smaller areas

State capital: Salt Lake City is perhaps more widely known as the home to the headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whose golden statue of the Angel Moroni is seen

The highest rates are in fact seen in 
states with constitutional bans on gay marriage - Mississippi having the
 largest rate among all states with 26 percent.

The smaller cities in the country, with populations less than 1 million, had the highest rates among them all with 65 percent of same-sex couples in Grand Forks North Dakota/Minnesota said to be raising children.

'Parenting among same-sex couples is more common in socially conservative parts of the county,' Gary J. Gates, the researcher behind the study, told MSN News.

'I wasn’t necessarily expecting Salt Lake City to top the list,' he continued, 'but I did expect that metro areas like San Francisco and New York, with their more LGBT supportive social and legal climates, would have relatively lower proportions of same-sex couples raising children.'

New York and Los Angeles were both 
still found having more same-sex couples with children in comparison to 
others, but their ratio was substantially lower.

Utah
 resident Weston Clark, who shares an adopted 3-year-old boy with his 
partner, believes it's the state's love of family that binds them all 
together.

'In Utah, especially those of us who are from Utah originally, it’s ingrained in our culture that family is important,' he told the Salt Lake Tribune. 'It doesn’t matter if you’re gay or straight, you still want that.'

Clark University Associate Professor of Psychology Abbie Goldberg agrees.

'When you ask, "Why are you living here?" they almost always say family,' Goldberg, who has studied gay and lesbian parents in rural areas, told the LA Times.

'It shouldn't really be surprising. They value family — and now they're creating families of their own.'
