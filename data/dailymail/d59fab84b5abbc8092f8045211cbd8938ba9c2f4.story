A one-man business is facing the wrath of the BBC over the name of his property maintenance and repairs service.

The corporation has complained to Terry Jacobs that the name, Tel’s DIY SOS, could damage the reputation of its home renovation show, DIY SOS.

BBC executives wrote to Mr Jacobs and insisted that he change it or face ‘further action’.

Damaging: The BBC has told Terry Jacobs (pictured) to change the name of his firm, Tel's DIY SOS, because it is too similar to the corporation's show DIY SOS

Mr Jacobs, 56, who has been visiting customers in and around Bracknell, Berkshire, for seven years, said: ‘No one has ever said to me “Are you something to do with the DIY programme on the telly?”

‘If I was a multi-million pound company I could understand, but it seems they have nothing better to do than pick on a small man.’

Mr Jacobs from Warfield, Bracknell, will now remove ‘SOS’ from the name displayed on his van.

The show, which is presented by Nick Knowles, follows a team of tradesmen as they transform near-derelict homes and has been on air since 1999.

'Picking on the small man': Mr Jacobs will remove the 'SOS' from the name

However, since 2010 the show has been extended to an hour and is now called 'DIY SOS - The Big Build'.

Nevertheless, BBC executives wrote to Mr Jacobs and insisted that he change the name of his business or face further action.

Mr Jacobs, who has been visiting customers in and around Bracknell, Berkshire, for the last seven years, said he got the letter on July 9.

He now has 21 days to formally make the change and notify the BBC.

'It seems they have nothing better to do than pick on a small man,' said Mr Jacobs, from Warfield, Bracknell.

'No-one has ever said to me 'Are you something to do with the DIY programme on the telly?'.

'If I was a big multi-million pound company I could understand, but it just seems a little bit pathetic.

'They are trying to say they own 'DIY SOS' and are telling me to change the name because it is their brand name.

'I was aware of the programme but I thought of the name as I'm not just a painter and decorator. I never gave it (the programme) a thought.

'They have stated in the letter if I don't alter the name and change it in writing they will take it further.'

To comply with the BBC's request, Mr Jacobs, who only uses his van to advertise his business, will remove 'SOS' from the name.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC works actively to protect both its reputation and the goodwill in its programme titles. This is to avoid any confusion among the public that those goods or services are either connected to or endorsed by the BBC.’
