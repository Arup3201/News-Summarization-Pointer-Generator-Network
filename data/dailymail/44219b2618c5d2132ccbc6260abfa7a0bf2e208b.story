Insight: Timothy Cannon has lifted the veil on the previously secretive execution process

A top corrections officer has lifted the lid on how Florida carries out its executions - revealing that all officials test the death chamber to ensure it is comfortable for the doomed inmate.

Timothy Cannon, the assistant secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections and the team leader present at every execution, spoke out about the previously secretive process as part of a lawsuit involving an inmate who is fighting a new execution drug.

The lawsuit has been brought by attorneys for Paul Howell, who is scheduled to die by lethal injection on February 26 for killing a state trooper in 1992. His lawyers argue that the first of the new injected drugs, midazolam, isn't effective at preventing the pain of the subsequent drugs.

Cannon told a Leon County court in his testimony that
ahead of executions, each team member 'has to serve in the role of the condemned 
during training at some point'.

'We've
 changed several aspects of just the comfort level for the inmate while 
lying on the gurney,' he said.

'Maybe we put sponges under the hand or 
padding under the hands to make it more comfortable, changed the pillow,
 the angle of things, just to try to make it a little more comfortable, 
more humane and more dignified as we move along.'

He then detailed the inmate's final moments from the officers' points of view.

Routine: His testimony, which was given as part of a lawsuit against a new execution drug, revealed that they now carry out a new 'consciousness check' to make sure the inmate is not conscious

He said an 
inmate is first injected with two syringes of midazolam and a syringe of 'flush' - saline solution to get the drug into the body. Midazolam is a
 sedative.

Once the three syringes have been administered from an
 anonymous team of pharmacists and doctors in a back room, Cannon carries out consciousness checks.

Cannon
 told a Leon County court that a new inmate 'consciousness check' is 
given due to news media reports and other testimony stemming from an 
October 15 execution - the root of Howell's suit.

Death
 row inmate William Happ was the first to receive the new lethal 
injection drug trio and an Associated Press reporter noted he acted 
differently during the execution than those before him.

It appeared Happ remained conscious longer and made more body movements after losing consciousness.

Cannon
 said that during Happ's execution and the ones that came before it, he 
did two 'consciousness checks' based on what he learned at the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons in Indiana.

These
 are a 'shake and shout,' where he vigorously shakes the inmate's 
shoulders and calls his name loudly, and also strokes the inmate's 
eyelashes and eyelid.

After
 Happ's execution, Cannon said the department decided to institute a 
'trapezoid pinch', where he squeezes the muscle between an inmate's neck
 and shoulder.

It was added 
'to ensure we were taking every precaution we could possibly do to 
ensure the person was, in fact, unconscious,' Cannon said. 'To make sure
 that this process was humane and dignified.'

During the consciousness checks, the anonymous team of doctors in the back room 
watches the inmate's face on a screen, which is captured by a video 
camera in the death chamber.

The inmate is also hooked up to a heart 
monitor, Cannon said.

There are two executioners in the back room
 - the ones who deploy the drugs - along with an assistant team leader, 3 medical professionals, an independent monitor from the Florida 
Department of Law Enforcement and two corrections employees who hold an open line to the governor's office.

Put to death: The lawsuit comes after William Happ, left, appeared to stay conscious for longer with the new drug used in executions last year. He was put to death for raping and killing Angie Crowley, right, in 1986

If the team determines that the inmate is unconscious, the other two lethal drugs are administered.

But lawyers for Howell say that they are concerned that the midazolam does not produce a deep enough level of unconsciousness to prevent the inmate from feeling the pain of the second and third injection and causes a death that makes the inmate feel as though he is being buried alive.

'Beyond just the fact that Constitution requires a humane death, if we decided that we wanted perpetrators of crime to die in the same way that their victims did then we would rape rapists. And we don't rape rapists,' said Sonya Rudenstine, a Gainesville attorney who represents Howell.

'We should not be engaging of the behavior that we have said to abhor. If we are going to kill people, we have to do it humanely. It's often said the inmate doesn't suffer nearly as much as the victim, and I believe that's what keeps us civilized and humane.'

Corrections spokeswoman Jessica Cary said on Wednesday that the department 'remains committed to doing everything it can to ensure a humane and dignified lethal injection process'.

Cannon's testimony is 
notable because it shows that the Department of Corrections has changed 
its procedures - namely the consciousness checks - since the state started using a new cocktail of lethal 
injection drugs.

Howell, the inmate appealing the execution based on the new drug, is scheduled
 to die by lethal injection later this month.

In 1992, Howell made a bomb intended to kill a woman who could link him to an earlier murder, put it in a microwave, wrapped it like a present and commissioned a friend to drive it to her home.

But the friend was stopped for speeding on the way to her house by Trooper Jimmy Fulford, who learned that the car had been loaned by Howell. Officers told him the friend would be taken to custody - and he did not tell them the car was containing a bomb.

Fulford was later granted permission to search the car and was holding the package when it exploded, killing him. Howell was charged with the trooper's murder.
