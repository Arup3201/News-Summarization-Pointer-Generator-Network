A firefighter says a cigarette tossed onto mulch may have caused a destructive fire at a popular wedding venue in Massachusetts.

Deputy Fire Chief Steven Bagley said that the fire started at the Lakeview Pavilion in Foxborough on Saturday night then spread to the main building.

Bagley says the building did not have sprinklers and firefighters took water from a nearby pond to try and extinguish the blaze. The remainder of the building is now being demolished.

Justice of the Peace Jerry Cibley says the fire began at the end of a wedding as the couple, their groomsmen and bridesmaids walked down the aisle.

Between 140 and 150 people attended the wedding.

Big day ruined by fire: Flames broke out in a Foxborough wedding facility just after a ceremony had been completed just after 7 pm Saturday. All wedding guests were evacuated from the Lakeview Pavilion before firefighters arrived on scene

A firefighter works on the scene of a multiple alarm fire at the popular Lakeview Pavilion in Foxborough, Mass. According to guests at the venue, the fire is believed to have started in a pile of newly-applied mulch

The fire department said the wind off the water was a major factor; the fire started in the rear of the building on the outside, and quickly spread.

'We did bring it down to ground level, which leads us to believe cigarette smoking, careless disposal in that area, led to this disastrous event,' said Capt. Edward Noonan of the Foxborough Fire Department.

The building, more than 100 years old, did not have a sprinkler system because it was grandfathered in.

'It was determined that the fire was an accident due to careless disposal of fire materials,' Noonan said. 'We don’t know who the smoker is at this time.'

All that remains: Firefighters save the sign from the venue in the hope that it may be reused in the future. Lakeview Pavilion burned to the ground after a fire was started from a cigarette thrown onto dry mulch

Gone in an instant: Foxborough fire officials said careless disposal of smoking material sparked the three-alarm fire that destroyed the 108-year-old venue, now reduced to charred rubble

Noonan said because the incident was an accident, the person who discarded the cigarette into the mulch will most likely not be charged with a crime, 'but they should have practiced common sense'.

Several onlookers said it appeared the fire started in some newly-applied mulch outside the building, which is surrounded by a lake and woods, but it quickly spread to the building itself.

'The bride and groom are devastated — this was their big day,' Cibley said.

'I’m thankful everybody got out safely. It went up so quickly and could have been a lot worse with 140 to 150 people in there.'

The couple have not been named and wish to stay anonymous.

Reports that surfaced on Twitter said the Renaissance Hotel in Foxborough quickly organized a makeshift reception.

Scores of onlookers arrived at the scene to lament the loss of the 108-year-old landmark.

'Thank goodness the lake is there,' said Paul Hubrich, who lives down the road.

'It’s incredibly sad — thank goodness everyone got out okay.'

Landmark: The Lakeview Pavilion in Foxborough is 108-years-old and a celebrated venue in the area, accommodating countless weddings and proms

'They tried so hard to save this building, but it was just fully engulfed,' Cibley explained.

Firefighters did save 
the carved wooden sign that hung over the entrance to the building 
before the demolition process was to begin.

'We wanted to give it to the family, so they can hang it on the next building,' Selectman Mark Sullivan said.

The
 Kourtidis family, the owners of the 108-year-old facility for more than
 25 years, said it was 'devastated' by the fire, but said helping the 
couples who booked the venue for future weeks was their 'first 
priority.'

'We want all of 
our brides and grooms and customers to know that they are our first 
priority. We are dedicated to making sure that they still have the 
wedding or event of their dreams,' the family said in a statement.

The facility first opened on July 4, 1906 as Lake View Park, complete with a dance hall pavilion, dining room, theater and bandstand, under the ownership of the Ross family, according to the facility’s website.

It changed hands several times over the years and was purchased by Efstathios 'Steve' and Kiparisia 'Kathy' Kourtidis in 1988, when it was known as Lakeview Ballroom.

The facility was renamed to Lakeview Pavilion and is managed by the couple’s daughters, Anastasia Tsoumbasnos and Natalia Kapourelakos.

The popular wedding venue had undergone renovations in recent years.

Patricia Kissinger, who lives down the road, said she felt badly for the owners.

'We heard a lot of fire engines and ambulances coming down the road and after 10 or so knew it was something serious,' she said.

'They just kept coming. It’s just so sad, this is such a beautiful, historic place. We all love it. And the owners have been so good to the neighborhood.'
