An artist accused of using child pornography in a Melbourne art installation damaged the reputations of the children depicted, a court has heard.

Paul Yore, 26, pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to producing and possessing child pornography over an installation that included children's faces attached to images of nude adults.

Acting Sergeant Kirei Wall told the Melbourne Magistrates Court that although police had not determined who the children were, it was clear their rights had been impinged.

'I ask your honour to consider the reaction of these children,' she told the magistrate on Tuesday.

'Placing these children, cutting out their photographs, encroaches on the rights and the reputations of children', Ms Wall said.

The work, titled 'Everything is F*****', was on display at St Kilda's Linden Centre for Contemporary Art last year.

Defence barrister Neil Clelland said the work was not child pornography, but a legitimate form of art.

'You might not like the art, you might find it offensive,' Mr Clelland said.

The images were part of an exhibit at the St Kilda's Linden Centre for Contemporary Art last year

'(But) it is not being used for the purposes of sexual gratification or prurient motives. It is artistic expression', he continued.

National Gallery of Victoria senior curator of contemporary art Max Delany told the court that Yore - from Footscray just west of Melbourne - was a talented, serious and accomplished artist.

He said the installation could be interpreted in a number of different ways, but said the work certainly had artistic merit.
