England’s 8,000 fans battled bravely to make their voices heard in the Sao Paulo Arena but this is a South American World Cup and Montevideo is ‘only’ 960 miles from Sao Paulo. Uruguayan fans outnumbered England 3:1.

Still, at least they had a touch more local support than Manaus, where Roy Hodgson’s comments before the World Cup draw last year about not wanting to play in the Amazon turned the Brazilian crowd against England.

It's not just the England media which is obsessed with Wayne Rooney. When the team line-ups were announced, it was Rooney who antagonised the Uruguayan fans most, with deafening whistles all round. Presumably it’s better to be hated than ignored – it implies a threat.

And some might say that obsession comes with the territory when you have an image rights’ deal in the region of £100,000 a week and the star of a leading sportswear brand’s TV commercials.

Joe Hart was the most enthusiastic anthem singer again. The rest of the team are still looking a little like kids in school assembly being made to sing hymns. Hart also ran to the corner of England fans at the start to rouse them, eliciting a huge roar, cementing his popularity as one of the most popular England players.

He was also vocal in his displeasure that Suarez had been allowed to sneak in between the England centre halves to score.

It felt more like an autumnal day at Anfield than a Brazilian World Cup at the Arena Sao Paulo. The temperature had fallen to a decidedly cool 12 degrees with grey skies overhead there was the constant threat of cold drizzle.

For those exposed in the temporary and uncovered stands at each end of the ground, the rain thankfully held off. Despite the cold, there were disappointingly neither gloves nor snoods on show from the players.

Uruguay had a clear plan from the off – hassle Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka high up the pitch when England centre halves were in possession and disrupt England’s passing from there.

It was risky but it worked initially. Nicolas Lodeiro and Diego Cavani carried the burden of the workload and Cahill and Jagielka consequently looked nervous and unsettled, a state of mind which carried over into their defensive duties.
