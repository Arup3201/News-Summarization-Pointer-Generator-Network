Eight members of a drugs gang who plotted to flood Tyneside with £200,000 worth of cocaine were jailed for almost 25 years. 

Lee Cheetham, used a network of his friends to transport and divide up the drugs. 

The 35-year-old criminal, from Walker, Newcastle, planned to use a cutting agent benzocaine and a hydraulic press to reduce the purity of the cocaine and increase his profits.

Cheethan organised a 'bash house' in the Wallsend area of Newcastle where two members of the gang would use the cutting agent and the hydraulic press to prepare the cocaine for sale. 

Newcastle Crown Court heard that detectives had been keeping the 'bash house' on Hopper Street under surveillance. 

Telephone records revealed that the gang were preparing to 'bash' the drugs on May 12, 2013. 

The court heard that Dene Long obtained the benzocaine, which was being stored in the home of Cheetham's sister Karen. 

Paul Nichol was in charge of securing the cocaine as well the hydraulic press, which was being stored at Cheetham's business, LTC Tyres in Byker. 

Shaun McCumiskey handed the keys to the Hopper Street bash house to Anthony Hardy and Michael Duncan. Hardy was described in court as Cheetham's lieutenant while Duncan was Hardy's accomplice. 

Hardy and Duncan collected hydraulic press from the tyre centre. Police later observed Hardy at Karen Cheetham's house before he met with Nichol.

Once all the equipment and drugs were in place, Duncan and Hardy went into the bash house while their driver Lee Gourley kept a lookout outside. 

When Duncan and Hardy left the house and entered Gourley's car, police pounced. 

Gourley tried to flee but a police officer drove into the side of the car.

Paul Mitchell, prosecuting, said police found 85g of cocaine in the car, a key to the house, two carrier bags of rubbish, which included latex gloves, two discs from an hydraulic press and a knotted bag of white powder.

The drugs had a value of around £21,000 but, if the purity was reduced, they could have had a street value of up to £190,000.

Sentencing the ring, Judge Brian Forster said: 'This was clearly set up as a business and that business had one intention.

'Anyone involved in the business of supplying class A drugs must expect a substantial sentence.

'Lee Cheetham, it was clear that this was your business and there may have been others up the chain.

'From the evidence I have seen you were actively involved in running what was taking place.'

Chief Inspector Paul Knox, said: 'While investigating the gang we quickly identified that Lee Cheetham was the ringleader of the whole operation. He was the one making the plans and instructing the others on how they would run their illegal business.

'Cheetham is a calculated and dangerous man and it's reassuring to know that he will now spend the next nine years behind bars for what he has done.

'The others were involved to varying degrees; Hardy, Duncan, Nichol, and Gourley were all involved in dealing the drugs and moving them around Tyneside.

'Long got the gang the chemicals needed to cut their drugs, McCumiskey allowed them to use the property in Hopper Street, that belonged to his family, as the base for their drugs operation. And Cheetham even got his sister involved by getting her to agree to them using her house as a storage area for chemicals and drug making equipment.

'I hope this serves as a warning to those involved in the illegal selling and dealing of drugs in our area that we take this type of crime extremely seriously.

'We are always looking to target and take action against those looking to profit from the selling of drugs and we will continue to run operations like this to get you off our streets and out of our communities.'

Cheetham and Hardy, 28, of Walker Newcastle both pleaded guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine and were jailed for nine and four years respectively.  

Duncan, 24, Walker, was sentenced to three years and four months after also pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine. 

Nichol, 40, of Elswick, was found guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine after trial and was given four years.

Gourley, 38, of Walker, was handed 32 months after being concerned in the supply of a class A drug.

Long, 20, of Walker, pleaded guilty to being concerned in the supply of a class A drug and was given 12 months suspended for 18 months, and must complete 100 hours unpaid work.

Karen Cheetham, 37, from Heaton, was given a nine months in prison suspended for two years and 150 hours unpaid work after pleading guilty to assisting an offender.

McCumiskey, 34, of Wallsend, pleaded guilty to encouraging or assisting an offence and was handed 22 months in custody suspended for two years.

Christopher Knox, for Cheetham, said he wasn't a man living the high-life, while saying Nichol hadn't been in trouble for 15 years.

Tony Davis, for Hardy, said he felt great shame in becoming involved in the operation.

Shaun Routledge, for Duncan, said he had no real understanding of the scale of the plot and said Gourley played a lesser role in the operation.

Katherine Dunn, for Long, said his involvement was due to his naivety and stupidity.
