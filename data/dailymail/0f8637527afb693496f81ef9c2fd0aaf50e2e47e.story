She is one of the world's most beautiful and recognisable women, so painting an accurate portrait of the Duchess of Cambridge will never be easy.

But one woman has been praised for her 'warm' portrait of Kate - weeks after the official one was slammed by critics.

Artist Norren Denzil, 47, was inspired to paint her own picture of the former Kate Middleton after the official portrait by Paul Emsley was branded 'rotten' and 'unflattering'.

She spent three weeks perfecting her portrait of the princess, showing her looking relaxed and beaming warmly.

And now Norren has grand plans to show her hard work to the Duchess.

'The official portrait is technically brilliant but I don't think it captures the true natural beauty and personality of the Duchess,' said Noreen, who lives in Moulton, near Newmarket, Suffolk.

Inspiration: Norren was inspired to paint her own picture of Kate after the official portrait by Paul Emsley was branded 'rotten' and 'unflattering' and she is very proud of the result

'She has a great deal of warmth, which is why she is so popular and I wanted to show that in a portrait of my own.

'I'm pleased with the result and I've had a lot of good feedback, saying that my picture makes her look much more human.'

Noreen, whose past pictures have been snapped up by the chief executive of advertising agency Saatchi, used a series of photos of Kate as inspiration for her portrait.

In the final portrait she is shown dressed in a red suit which she wore on the Royal trip to Calgary in Canada.

Noreen now hopes to sell the portrait for £2,000, with the proceeds going to a charity of the Duchess's choosing.

She said: 'I am going to contact Clarence House as I would like the Duchess to see the portrait and choose a charity for the money to be donated to.'

In the past Noreen has also painted Princess Diana, Marlon Brando, Jack Nicholson, Daniel Craig, Bob Marley, Mick Jagger and Jimi Hendrix.

Warmth: Norren believes that Kate has a great deal of warmth, which is what she wanted to show that in her portrait

When the first official portrait of 
the Duchess of Cambridge was unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery in January it was greeted with a global eyebrow-raise you could 
practically hear.

Though 
Kate herself, 31, said Paul Emsley's likeness of her was 'amazing' and 
'brilliant', and her husband Prince William told the artist it was 
'absolutely beautiful', critics dismissed it as unflattering, ageing and
even 'rotten'.

Emsley even bit back at his critics, saying the aftermath of its unveiling 
felt like a 'witch hunt', but that there is still 'nothing I would have 
changed' about his painting.

Critical: Paul Emsley's official portrait was met by much criticism, although both the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were impressed

Speaking to Hello! magazine, he said:
'Some of the words written about it were so personal. I'd be inhuman if
I said it didn't affect me. When you take on commissions like this it 
is hazardous and you expect a bit of flak, but I expected nothing like 
the criticism I have received. I didn't expect it to go to the levels it
did.

'It felt like a bit 
of a witch hunt and people who have not even seen my portrait joined in 
with what quickly became a circus. The worst thing is it was not only 
destructive to me, but particularly upsetting for my two daughters and 
my wife.'

Emsley said that the praise of the 
Duke and Duchess meant more to him 'than anything else said or written',
but that he would urge people to visit the National Portrait Gallery 
since he feels 'half the problem is that the portrait doesn't photograph
well'.

According to the 
gallery, the number of people visiting since the painting went on 
display on 11 January has risen from 24,000 over that weekend, up from 
17,000 the week before.

The
Telegraph reported that postcards of the portrait are the 
fastest-selling item in the history of the gallery's permanent 
collection.

Rotten: His portrait was described as 'rotten' and critics said that it aged the Duchess
