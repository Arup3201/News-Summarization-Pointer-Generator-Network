This hapless driver had an incredible 
escape when his natural gas-powered pick-up truck exploded as he was 
filling up at a petrol station.

Moments
before the blast, the man is seen standing next to the pump and appears
to realise something is wrong as he reaches out to pull the hose from 
his vehicle.

But just as he grabs hold of the black plastic tube the vehicle's gas tank, which is under enormous pressure, blows up.

Filling up: The driver stands by a pump as he fill his pick-up truck with natural gas

Panic: Moments before the blast the man appears to realise something is wrong as he rips the hose away from his vehicle

The driver is caught by the full
force of the blast but manages to twist his face away and narrowly 
misses being hit by the passenger door as it flies open.

A
slow motion replay shows debris from the vehicle, including the heavy 
metal gas tank itself, flying across the petrol station forecourt as the
man staggers away.

Mercifully
the gas does not ignite, had it done so it is likely the entire petrol 
station would have gone up in flames and the man would have almost 
certainly been killed

Boom: The vehicle's high-pressure gas tank explodes just a few yards from where the driver is standing

Flashpoint: The gas tank blows up releasing a cloud of natural gas

The vehicle's door is sent flying open as debris is scattered over the forecourt

Clapped out: The vehicle is left a battered wreck as the man staggers across the forecourt

The incident happened at a petrol station in Southern Iran earlier this month.

Despite
having the third largest amount of oil reserves in the world, Iran has 
invested heavily in natural gas which is cheaper and cleaner burning.
