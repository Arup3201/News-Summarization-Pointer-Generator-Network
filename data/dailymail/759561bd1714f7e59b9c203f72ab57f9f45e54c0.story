A plane passenger thought he'd bleat-en the system by smuggling cocaine inside frozen goat meat - only to be nabbed by customs officers when he landed.

Yudishtir Maharaj was stopped on March 20 at JFK Airport in New York, by U.S. Customs and Border Protection on an incoming flight from Port of Spain, Trinidad.

The 24-year-old handed over a laptop computer and a black suitcase at security.

The luggage was then inspected by CBP officers who discovered three large packages of frozen meat.

When the meat was X-rayed, they noticed three square objects inside the flesh, according to the complaint.

They then drilled through the solid meat and found a white powder that later tested positive for cocaine.

Curious hiding place: Maharaj had flown from Trinidad's Port of Spain with the 7lbs stash of cocaine

Maharaj was arrested for the importation of a controlled substance and turned over to Homeland Security for further investigations.

Maharaj, who said he was a construction worker, denied any knowledge of the drugs when interviewed, Homeland Security special agent Michael Martinez said.

The total weight of the cocaine seized was approximately 7.35lbs.

Robert E. Perez, CBP Director of Field Operations New York, said the goat meat sting shows his squad are on the ball.

'This latest seizure demonstrates the vigilance of our CBP officers and their excellence in detecting those who would try to smuggle these illegal substances,' he said in a statement.
