Tonight is the start of the new series of Made in Chelsea.

It’s now been nearly three years since we started out (June 2011, to be precise) and this is the seventh series of the programme documenting the lives and loves of a set of young people who live in an around London SW3.

I think it’s safe to say that none of the original cast thought it would last this long when we started.

I’ve certainly gone through a major transition since the start of our TV journey. Now older (obviously) and wiser (possibly) - I've been through four girlfriends, countless rows, and one slap.

Physically there's been some big changes from the fresh faced lad above - I’m about a stone and-a-half lighter than my series one self, thanks to work out sessions at City Athletic gym and Forza T5 Super Strength supplements.

By series two I’d realised that TV adds a considerable amount of weight to you, and I went in for a style-re-vamp - chopping off the long-hair, and beard.

It took me till series six to realise that me and relationships aren’t really working on-screen or off - so this time round I’m single (or at least trying to be).

No commitments, no ties - and therefore no problems with infidelity and no unpleasant moments with soon-to-be ex-girlfriends down by the Embankment. Well, that's the plan anyway.

I’ve already seen the first episode (on E4 tonight 10pm) at a screening last Friday with all the cast and I don't want to give the game away with any of the storyline but it is without a doubt the best series yet.

Made In Chelsea really is at the top of its game now. There’s some great bon mots, some relationship issues (thankfully not me this time) and the occasional row thrown in for good measure. So enjoy.

On the same night - by the magic of television - is my appearance on 8 Out Of 10 Cats. For those not familiar with the show, it’s a humourous panel programme about the news stories of the week and consumer surveys hosted by Jimmy Carr, also featuring comedians Shaun Lock and Jon Richardson.

Current affairs is not exactly my strong suit and these guys are more than capable of ripping you apart verbally if you trip up on any subject - so this looked like it could easily turn into a car crash for me.

In the end, I think I held up quite well - or they were being gentle. Conversations were totally random and ranged from my style tips to Harry Styles (he wanted to know how to create the perfect pocket square), why I bought Quorn even though I’m not a vegetarian.

Sean Locke later went off a total tangent and started talking about giving therapy to fruit and glory holes in public fences (you’ll have to watch it to make sense of it.)

Then disaster struck. We were nearing the end of filming the show and I thought I was home and dry and, in a school boy error, I took my eye off the ball.

The final question was 'What would you like to know more about?' and the female guest comedian Katherine Ryan said with heavy sarcasm that she would like to know more about Peter Andre and what he did in his everyday home life.

Spencer had a toe-curlingly embarrassing experience on the panel

I lost concentration at that moment and said, 'Perhaps you should tune into Peter Andre My Life on ITV2.'

Jimmy Carr noticeably winced and said to the audience: 'I think that might be what she was getting at.'

It was toe-curlingly embarrassing and I hope that the camera failed to record my epic TV fail.

Hopefully there won't be any epic fails for me in series seven of Made In Chelsea - but I wouldn't bet on it.

All the best,
