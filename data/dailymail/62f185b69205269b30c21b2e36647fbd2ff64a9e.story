A second United flight departing New Jersey's Newark Liberty 
International Airport in the last two days has had to make an emergency 
landing.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says United Flight 409 bound for
Seattle returned to the airport at about 9:15 a.m. Sunday after reports of
possible smoke in the cabin and cockpit.

A United spokesman says the flight crew noticed an unusual smell in the
cockpit. No injuries were reported.

Second scare: United flight 409 to Seattle returned to Newark after smoke was reported in the cabin. United flight 96, pictured, was headed to Berlin from Newark, when it returned on Saturday night due to engine trouble

The emergency was the second in as many days. On Saturday night, a United
flight to Germany had to return to the airport after experiencing engine
problems.

Flight 96, which was departing from 
Newark Liberty Airport to Berlin, landed at about 8:10pm on Saturday 
night after a ‘mechanical issue with the engine,’ airline spokesman Joe 
Micucci said.

The plane was carrying 173 passengers and crew members. A Port Authority spokesman said no one was injured.

'It was a pretty scary sight,' a witness told The New York Post.

FBI spokesman Barbara Woodruff told CNN that a tire blew off during takeoff and flew into an engine, causing the fire but that was contrary to a statement from the FAA, that  said one of the engines on the Berlin-bound flight
apparently overheated on takeoff. 

Witnesses on the ground reported seeing fire coming from the engine shortly after the plane took off.

Keisha Thomas, who was driving on the
New Jersey Turnpike at the time, told CNN that she saw 'fireballs' near
the wing of the jet and heard loud 'pow' sounds.

Dennis Ostolaza, another witness, 
told the network that he heard a 'propeller sound' like a military 
helicopter as the plane took off, with 'black smoke and fire spitting 
out of the engine.'

Bergen said the plane crew initially reported 'an 
issue' with the plane's left engine but the aircraft then began 
operating normally. 

She said that as a precaution, the 
plane hovered around the airport for about two hours to burn off fuel 
west of Newark before the plane landed.

Fire: Fire crews, pictured, and police met the Boeing 757 when it landed although no passengers were injured
