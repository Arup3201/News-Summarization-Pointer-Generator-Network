Wang Lulu, the grieving widow of British businessman Neil Heywood, has begged for help to flee China

The grieving widow of British businessman Neil Heywood begged for help to flee China yesterday.

Chinese-born Wang Lulu made a dramatic visit to the British Embassy in Beijing.

She is understood to have asked for a visa to escape to the UK with her two young children.

Friends said they were ‘very worried’ about her safety, days after Chinese authorities named the wife of prominent politician Bo Xilai as a suspect in Mr Heywood’s murder.

His widow is afraid that the people who killed her husband might now come after her and her family.

The scandal has become the biggest political storm in decades in China and has prompted allegations of corruption in the emerging superpower’s highest echelons.

Visitors to the Heywood family home in an exclusive gated compound in Beijing were turned away by troops from the People’s Liberation Army.

The presence of the crack troops triggered fears that Mrs Heywood would be barred from fleeing the country, and sources said police had ordered her not to communicate with international journalists.

The Chinese government routinely clamps down on relatives and friends of dissidents who threaten its rule, and commentators fear it will show typical ruthlessness to Mrs Heywood as it prepares for a once-in-a-decade leadership transition this autumn.

Mr Bo, 62, was tipped for a place at the very top of the ruling Communist Party’s national leadership until his family was engulfed in the scandal surrounding 41-year-old Mr Heywood’s death.

The Old Harrovian was found in a hotel room in the city of Chongqing, western China, in November.

His death was initially blamed on excess alcohol and his body was cremated without a post-mortem examination.

But friends said he rarely drank and the case was reopened when a former police chief told U.S. officials he believed the British expatriate was poisoned.

This week, Chinese authorities named Mr Bo’s wife Gu Kailai as a suspect in the investigation and the Communist Party suspended her husband.

Mrs Gu is now in police custody and her husband under virtual house arrest, facing an investigation for serious disciplinary violations. A servant at the family home was also named as a suspect in the ‘intentional homicide’.

Mr Heywood knew the powerful couple for more than a decade and helped their son Bo Guagua, whom he had taught English, win a place at Harrow before studying at Oxford.

Mrs Gu was said to be godmother to the Heywoods’ 11-year-old daughter and seven-year-old son, who both attend the Beijing branch of Dulwich College, an international school for expats and privileged Chinese children.

But friends said Mr Heywood feared for his safety following an angry confrontation with Mrs Gu, 54, in which she allegedly ordered him to divorce his wife and swear a Mafia-style oath of allegiance to her family.

He reportedly gave a file detailing the Bo family’s finances to a British lawyer and described the papers as his ‘insurance policy’ should anything happen to him.

The business consultant was also said
 to have approached British authorities in 2010 about applying for 
citizenship for his wife.

A spokesman for the British Embassy 
in Beijing refused to confirm or deny Mrs Heywood’s visit yesterday, but
 confirmed the family had been offered consular ‘protection’.

He told the Daily Mail: ‘Mrs Heywood 
is a Chinese national. If she wants to leave she can apply for a visa. 
Her children have British passports.’

Mrs Heywood has refused to discuss the case, saying only that she is ‘so sad’ about her husband’s death.

A source said she had been warned to say nothing, saying: ‘Police officers questioned her recently and warned her not to speak to foreign media.’

Friends said they were worried for her safety as she struggled to cope with her grief and raising her children alone.

One said: ‘If a friend of yours  had died of some natural causes or had been bumped off on the other side of the world, and he was married and had two children, would you be concerned?

‘All his friends are concerned. We are all worried about all of them.’

Schoolfriends of Mr Heywood angrily rejected suggestions yesterday of any connection between the Harrow ‘old boy network’ and the murky circumstances surrounding the Briton’s murder.

According to one report, an ‘Old Harrovian Group of Four’, said to be doing business in China, fell out with Mrs Gu in 2005 over an alleged joint business venture.

Bo Guagua was sent to the famous Harrow School where he was mentored by Neil Heywood

Mr Heywood helped her son Bo Guagua get a place at Harrow, which charges fees of £7,345 a term, despite her husband’s political salary being little more than £300 a month.

After Harrow, Bo Guagua studied at Balliol College Oxford and is now at Harvard, where he has been in hiding since the scandal engulfed his family.

Edmund Robb gave the eulogy at Mr Heywood’s funeral in Battersea, south London, before Christmas.

Mr Robb, who has lived and worked in China and describes Mr  Heywood as ‘my oldest and best friend’, described claims about a ‘Group of Four’ as ‘bizarre’  and added: ‘We will be taking the appropriate action. We have referred the matter to the Press Complaints Commission.’
