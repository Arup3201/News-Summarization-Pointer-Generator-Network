This is the moment a suspected illegal immigrant was discovered after clinging to the bottom of a caravan as it drove from Calais to a suburban road in Kent.

The man, believed to be in his late teens, is thought to have tied himself to the chassis of the vehicle before it entered the Channel Tunnel.

He emerged after the two-hour journey as Paul Coles and his daughter, Joanne, were returning the vehicle to its owner in Hoppers Way, Ashford.

The young man, thought to be in his late teens or early twenties, was found after stowing away for the journey from Calais to Ashford in Kent, which takes around an hour-and-a-half 

Police arrived at the home of Teresa Tyrer, who runs Scarlett Motorhome Hire, and took the man away in tears. 

A spokesman said this morning he had been passed on to Home Office Immigration Enforcement. 

Mrs Tyrer, said the youngster looked 'shaken' and as though he 'didn't know what to do' when he was found this afternoon.

'The man and his daughter had been driving since 3am to make the crossing at Callais.

'Literally the last thing I said to them before they left was to keep the garage doors locked and not to stop at any petrol stations,' she said. 

'Many people are tempted to because it's cheaper over there but I've heard so much about people being bullied at the stations near the tunnel and others not wanting to get out because so many people were hanging around trying to catch a lift.'

As Mr Coles unloaded his daughter's motorcycles, he discovered the young man who 'spoke no English'. 

The suspected illegal immigrant 'sat patiently' on the grass as Kent Police arrived before taking him away in their vehicle. Teresa Tyrer said the young man, though to be around 17, cried as he was taken away

The young man clung to the motorhome for the duration of the 54mile journey from the coast of France to Hoppers Way in Ashford, Kent 

'As soon as the father saw him he shouted for his daughter to get back and call the police. When the young lad came out he looked very shaken, he didn't quite know what to do and he just sat there patiently after we called the police. 

'He was scribbling notes on a piece of paper in Arabic, whether they were to give to the police I don't know.

'I know there are many who don't have any sympathy for them and I don't want a ton of [illegal immigrants] coming into the country but they are human beings at the end of the day. 

'He was just a young lad, he showed no signs of aggression he just sat there calmly the poor soul. 

'It seemed as though he'd put everything he's got into getting here and he'll probably be sent back.' 

A spokesman for Kent Police said: ' We were called to an address in Ashford at 1.46 pm to a report of a suspected illegal immigrant found underneath a motor home.

Immigrants protesting for human rights in Calais marched through the town's streets earlier this month, demanding entry to the UK

'The man was located and has been transferred to Home Office immigration enforcement for them to take any further action.' 

The Home Office has been contacted by MailOnline for comment. 

Thousands of immigrants have descended upon the French coastal down in recent months, setting up makeshift homes in tents and huts and demanding entry to the UK. 

Campaigners yielding signs have marched through the town's streets, claiming their human rights are being violated as port authorities battle to keep them from storming onto ferries and stowing-away in vehicles driving through the Channel Tunnel.
