Ed Balls was involved in a bizarre interview tonight about his sex life in which he suggested he was a ‘long slow burn’ in bed.

In comments likely to embarrass his wife Yvette Cooper, he commented on a survey by Mumsnet which found women believe he would make one of the best lovers in the Commons.

Women revealed their crushes on the Shadow Chancellor, who was described as a ‘sexy beast’, as well as Boris Johnson – who was described as fun in bed.

An LBC Radio programme, hosted by Iain Dale, confronted Mr Balls with recordings from women and men on the street describing what they thought of his looks.

One man said ‘Yikes. He could rock my world’, while a woman said: ‘He is quite attractive yes, I suppose’.

Later commentators were not as complimentary, saying: ‘He's not unattractive but he's not attractive. Six out of 10?’, while another woman said: ‘Not particularly to my taste, he's a bit old for me.’

'Sexy beast' Ed Balls was a popular choice among mothers online, while Mumsnet users said they would rather bed Ed Miliband's brother than the Labour leader and said David Cameron is 'too arrogant to be generous' in the bedroom 

Another said: ‘Would I want to spend the night with him? Hmm, if I'm desperate, maybe.’

Asked for his comments, Mr Balls said: ‘I thought that started well but slightly fell away towards the end.’

In a jokey exchange of comments, Mr Dale asked him: ‘Is that what happens with you, it starts well but you slightly fade away?’

Mr Balls replied: ‘No, long slow burn.’

Mr Dale then asked him whether the his wife Yvette Cooper – the Shadow Home Secretary – would relate to the comments.

The Shadow Chancellor replied: ‘Nick Clegg showed why politicians shouldn't speculate on such matters so I think I won't go there.’

The presenter then asked him whether his leader would be annoyed with the survey. Ed Miliband was not described as a sexy beast – with women saying they would prefer a night of passion with David Miliband.

Mr Balls joked: ‘It's another example of the return to our Blair-Brown bad relationship. I can't believe you're a sexy beast not me, what a load of tosh.’

Mr Dale them moved on to what Mr Balls thought of the fact that women believed the London Mayor would be fun in bed.

The Shadow Chancellor replied: ‘I'm desperately trying to hold back on making libellous statements. Personally I don't know if Boris Johnson's fun in bed.’

At the end of Mr Balls’ appearance, he took a call from ‘Marie from Putney’ who said that despite starting a campaign four years ago for better-looking politicians, no progress had been made.

Mr Balls asked her whether she found him attractive, saying: ‘Privately Marie, just between you and me, with nobody else listening, am I not on the list?’

Marie replied: ‘No, Ed, I'm sorry. You're a thoroughly great guy otherwise.’ 

Nick Clegg was deemed good-looking but likely to be a 'damp squib' in the bedroom, while many said Boris Johnson would be 'fun'

Tony Blair was also mentioned by Mumsnet users, though some said he would be too busy looking in a mirror
