New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has claimed that Russian president Vladimir Putin stole his Super Bowl XXXIX ring in 2005, but that he was asked by American government officials to say it was a gift to save international embarrassment.

Kraft spoke about the incident on Thursday night in front of a packed crowd at Carnegie Hall’s Medal of Excellence gala at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.

‘I took out the ring and showed it to
 [Putin], and he put it on and he goes, “I can kill someone with this 
ring,”’  Kraft told the crowd.

New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has claimed that Vladimir Putin took his Super Bowl ring and that the White House told him to say it was a gift

‘I put my hand out and he put it in his pocket, and three KGB guys got around him and walked out.’

The incident occurred in 2005, the summer after the Patriots had won their third Super Bowl under his Kraft's ownership.

He was one of a number of prominent American businessmen who visited Russia to meet with Putin. 

At the time, Kraft released a public statement saying the 
diamond-encrusted ring - worth more than  $25,000 - had been a gift.

'President Putin, a great and knowledgeable sports fan, was clearly taken
 with its uniqueness. I decided to give him the ring as a symbol of the 
respect and admiration that I have for the Russian people and [his] 
leadership,' read Kraft's statement at the time.

But now 
Kraft has claimed that Putin simply pocketed the 4.94-carat ring and that the White House intervened when he 
demanded it back, reports the New York Post.

According to Kraft he received a call from the George W. Bush-run White House, saying, 'It would really be in the best interest of US-Soviet relations if you meant to give the ring as a present.'

But, Kraft said, 'I really didn’t [want to]. I had an emotional tie to the ring, it has my name on it. I don’t want to see it on eBay. There was a pause on the other end of the line, and the voice repeated, "It would really be in the best interest if you meant to give the ring as a present.’”

The ring is reportedly kept in the Kremlin library.
