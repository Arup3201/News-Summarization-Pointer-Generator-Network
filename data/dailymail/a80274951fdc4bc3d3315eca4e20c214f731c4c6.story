The influx continues apace. All the world wants a Kiwi — players and coaches. New Zealand’s export trade in rugby men is booming, with All Blacks the prized commodity.

This week, two English clubs have taken the plunge in deciding to recruit from the most successful sporting team on Earth — with London Irish lining up prop Ben Franks and Gloucester finalising a deal for lock Jeremy Thrush. 

The Exiles have gone a step further and opted to put a Kiwi, Tom Coventry, in charge of their post-Brian Smith revival mission.

Kiwi Tom Coventry (second right) has been tasked with leading London Irish

He will arrive from Waikato Chiefs with supreme credentials. As a former team-mate of Warren Gatland, he will be expected to emulate the Lions coach by prospering on this side of the equator, but a gold-plated Super Rugby c.v. is not conclusive proof of an ability to thrive in these parts. Tactics and conditions are markedly different.

A Kiwi accent provides no guarantee of effective rugby wisdom this far from home, although that is often the awestruck assumption.

Since the game turned professional, countless southern imports have failed to live up to their lavish billing. 

For instance, Gloucester are being superbly served by All Black prop John Afoa now, but scrum-half Jimmy Cowan, another who wore the silver fern with distinction, was unable to deliver the sort of red-hot performances worthy of his blue-chip reputation.

Pick the right recruit from the far side and it can be a wondrous decision, as Harlequins have found with Nick Evans — likewise Exeter, with Dean Mumm.

Perhaps Franks and Thrush will acquit themselves well and savour the hard knocks up front, as Brad Thorn is at Leicester. 

It might be that incoming forwards prosper more than box-office backs such as Rico Gear, who utterly failed to set the world alight for Worcester.

Kiwi coaches are all the rage. Three of the Six Nations have them, as do two of the four Welsh regions, but they have to embrace cultural differences, as Gatland has done and as Wayne Smith did at Northampton years ago.

Other New Zealanders have thought that their methods and philosophies could be applied here without modifications and they have been wrong. 

Mike Brewer’s bad- tempered reign at Sale encapsulated that flawed logic.

So, best wishes to Coventry, Franks and Thrush, and to their compatriots who will surely join the northern migration. 

But they should be in no doubt — a Kiwi passport will ensure safe passage through customs, but not through the weekly maelstrom of the Aviva Premiership.

An array of Premiership statistics for the season to date have highlighted why England will not wait a moment longer than necessary to select Nathan Hughes, when he qualifies on residency next year.

In light of the grim news that Ben Morgan will be out for at least six months after breaking a leg, there has been a tide of support for Nick Easter to receive a recall, and he is certainly worthy of consideration based on prime form and enduring — perhaps unprecedented — influence. 

Wasps' Fiji-born star Nathan Hughes is in line for an England call-up once he qualifies on residency next year

But the data lays bare the impact of Wasps’ Fiji-born force of nature. Hughes has made 154 carries, second only to Thomas Waldrom of Exeter, and he is third in the ‘defenders beaten’ category with 42, behind two fellow Polynesian game-breakers, Sinoti Sinoti and Semesa Rokoduguni. 

When it comes to offloads, Hughes is behind Easter but not far — with 22 to the 36-year-old’s 23. Hughes is also joint top of the ‘turnovers won’ chart. He is making a profound impact and holding out for England recoognition is likely to prove a shrewd move. His time will come.

Europe has Anglo-French accent 

Clubs, regions and provinces resume European combat this weekend with the pool tables pointing to Top 14 and Premiership dominance of the quarter-final places.

Saracens should have the firepower to take Pool 1 to the wire by beating Munster at home, while Bath can win in Toulouse, to throw Pool 4 wide open.

Harlequins v Wasps is too close to call, but expect a reaction from Northampton against the Ospreys in Swansea after their grim defeat at Sale last weekend. Leicester are likely to snuff out the Welsh challenge tonight by beating the Scarlets.

Leinster may be the lone Guinness Pro12 representatives in the last eight, which would leave the new tournament with a lack of variety. 

If the Dubliners miss out, it may well boil down to an Anglo-French Cup — which was meant to be the fall-back plan during their threatened breakaway, not the actual outcome.

The last word 

Of all the frustrations that Stuart Lancaster has to put up with as England head coach, surely the toughest to accept must be the vast gulf between Billy Twelvetrees in theory and Billy Twelvetrees in reality. The Gloucester captain is in danger of becoming the wasted enigma of the era.

His performance in the Premiership encounter with Saracens last Friday night summed up what drives the national coaches to distraction, as he mixed flashes of effortless class with far too many chronic lapses. 

The England No 12 shirt is there for the taking if Gloucester's billy Twelvetrees can cut out the chronic lapses

Suspect decision-making has so often been his downfall and it was in evidence again at Kingsholm. England’s No 12 shirt is there for the taking, but Twelvetrees is not showing signs that he can take a firm grip on it. He has all the wide-ranging attributes that Lancaster sees in his ultimate vision for the position.

At his best, he is the second receiver at inside centre who can help to ignite England’s back line, but without the addition of composure and consistency, his hopes of fulfilling that potential are destined to fade, which would be a desperate pity.
