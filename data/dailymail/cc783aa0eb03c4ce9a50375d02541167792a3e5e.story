Holland winger Arjen Robben has insisted Argentina have zero chance of beating Germany in the World Cup final on Sunday.

The Bayern Munich man, who impressed during the tournament in Brazil, suffered penalty shoot-out heartbreak against Alejandro Sabello's team in the semi-finals on Wednesday.

Despite this he believes the latter have little or no hope of overcoming Joachim Low's side.

He told Dutch reporters: 'Germany's going to win the World Cup. No doubt about that. The Argentines will not stand a chance.'

In what may appear to some people as sour grapes, Robben's admission comes as a surprise considering the fact Argentina possess one of, if not the best player in the world in the shape of Lionel Messi.

Reflecting on the defeat against the Argentinians, the 30-year-old felt it was purely bad luck which resulted in their exit from the last four and remained proud of their achievements.

'Penalties are not only a game of pure chance - we've shown that against Costa Rica. We did a very good job there, and were really successful.

'It didn't work out today during the penalties. We also had some bad luck but, sadly, that's part of football.

'I am incredibly proud of what we have achieved though. We presented ourselves really well.'
