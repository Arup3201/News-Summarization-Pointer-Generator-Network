Businessman: Super successful Chad Pike has spent huge sums on the village in an attempt to turn it into a tourist destination for wealthy Americans but locals have started a rebellion

Walking around Edington, it isn’t hard to see why the fabulously wealthy American property expert Chad Pike chose it as the place to buy a rural weekend retreat.

The Wiltshire beauty spot — population 750, home to a pub and a 14th-century church built by the then Bishop of Winchester William Edington, and with spectacular views over Salisbury Plain — is a perfect example of a sedate English village.

It is gloriously pretty, the lanes hemmed with pink and white wildflowers.

And it hosts all manner of community events, including next month’s harvest supper.

Best of all, it boasts some of the smiliest, most welcoming people you could ever meet.

‘We all say hello to one another around here,’ beams Linda Stone, 61, a retired lumberjack who has lived in Edington all her life.

‘There is a real sense of community. It’s friendly and peaceful.’ Until now, that is.

Thanks to a flurry of digging and drilling, Edington is not feeling very peaceful or friendly at all.

From the graveyard of Edington Priory Church, the constant hum of machinery hangs in the air.

The source is Pike’s £3.5 million Grade I-listed mansion next door.

After a series of bizarre local developments pioneered by the 41-year-old property tycoon, villagers are now fearing for the future of their idyll — and threatening Pike with an Asbo if the noise doesn’t stop.

The saga began three years ago when Pike, who has a glamorous blonde wife, Blake, and four children, bought the house from retired businessman Rupert Cooper, who’d been there for 32 years.

Christopher Parsons, 78, a retired 
pilot whose home is next to Pike’s back garden, says: ‘Rupert did 
everything you’d expect from a village squire. He went to parties, took 
part in local activities. He was part of the community.’

The villagers were initially 
intrigued by their new neighbour, and hoped he’d pick up where Rupert 
left off.

All they knew was that Pike was the European vice-president of
Blackstone, which handles some of the world’s largest property deals, 
including Southern Cross care homes and Center Parcs holiday villages.

Generous: He is believed to have donated thousands towards a new organ for Edington church

Christopher says: ‘There was a feeling of goodwill — I had Mr Pike round for drinks one evening. He seemed very civilised.’

Pike won over villagers by donating 
£60,000 to the church organ fund. Then 18 months ago he stepped in to 
buy the village pub, The Lamb.

Most locals were delighted. They’d 
discussed buying it themselves but were happy to make way for an 
experienced developer, who renamed it the Three Daggers and added a 
dining room and play area.

‘We couldn’t have done what he did,’ 
says Phil Davis, 56, a retired businessmen whose back garden overlooks 
Pike’s property. ‘It’s gone from traditional boozer to gastro-pub, but 
that’s not necessarily a bad thing.’

And at first, the hammering and 
digging noises coming from Pike’s house didn’t raise concern.

Adrian 
Windo, 54, a computer consultant, says: ‘He was making modifications but
everyone’s allowed that, aren’t they? We believed it was in good 
faith.’

It was only when some inquisitive 
villagers looked on the internet to learn more about their new 
neighbour, that the tide started to turn.

Says Adrian: ‘We learnt that 
he is partnered with a holiday company called Eleven Experience, and he 
seemed to see the village as a tourist destination.’

The business, geared towards wealthy 
Americans, offers ‘unique vacation experiences for those who prefer a 
little adventure with their luxury’.

It advertises beach holidays in the
Bahamas, skiing trips to Colorado and luxury chalets in the French 
Alps.

Now activity holidays in Wiltshire have joined the list.

One 
company video promises visitors the chance to hunt, shoot, fish and 
horse-ride in Edington. A smart, young couple are seen zooming through 
woodland in a giant Land-Rover and speeding off on motorbikes.

Linda squeals: ‘Can you imagine? We 
get plenty of walkers at the weekend, and they are welcome.

They come 
for the peace and quiet and they don’t cause a fuss. But now it is going
to be a load of Americans, horse-riding and driving all over the 
place.’

The renovations of Pike’s properties 
were soon seen as something more than modifications for him and his 
family.

The first problem for villagers was his lake — thought to be a 
medieval carp lake fished in by Augustine monks at the Priory. Pike had 
to drain it following an infestation of fish lice, and now it stands 
empty — an ugly patch of grey

It is to be refilled and restocked so
visitors staying in two cottages on Pike’s land can fish.

The site also
boasts a tennis court, swimming pool and brand new stable. ‘And he’s 
moving in housekeeping staff,’ says Linda. ‘I mean, really!’

The Three Daggers — described on 
Eleven Experience’s website as the perfect place for ‘a proper Sunday 
brunch’ — is also viewed with new suspicion. Linda says: ‘He’s turned it
into a place for yuppies.’

In most villages, disputes are 
usually settled over a chat over a garden wall. But the villagers 
haven’t had much luck in contacting Mr Pike.

Adrian says: ‘He doesn’t 
really live here, he lives in London. What he’s doing is a commercial 
development by stealth.'

Pike’s workers are ever-present.

Mr 
Parsons recalls how three months ago he woke to find his garden hemmed 
in by a hedge of 3m-high yew trees. ‘There was no warning,’ he says.

It casts a shadow over his garden and
runs along past the house where Linda lives with her partner Andrew 
Siejoke. Then the yews turn to beech at Phil’s.

‘But this is where he made his 
mistake,’ says Mr Parsons. ‘Beeches are deciduous. Yews are evergreen, 
and it is illegal to have an evergreen hedge that’s more than 2m-tall. 
It violates part eight of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act.’

Christopher has now become the 
ring-leader of a local rebellion. ‘I told Mr Pike I was going to apply 
for an Anti-Social Behaviour Order.

He said: “If you threaten me with an
Asbo you will be the laughing stock of the village.” ’

One neighbour said they moved to the village for peace and quiet but claims that he has been disturbed by 'constant' noise from building work at Pike's home

Undettered, Christopher has written to the council. But in the meantime, another of Pike’s developments is causing bad feeling.

Next door to his pub, he is building 
the village’s only shop, selling fruit and vegetables grown in his 
garden and other local products.

Currently it is little more than a 
frame surrounded by huge cranes but villagers are scathing of the 
‘gourmet boutique’. Mr Parsons says: ‘People around here don’t buy that 
sort of food. He is trying to run Harrods in Edington.’

Mr Pike has also attracted ridicule 
for installing a space-age security system around his property. To get 
to the house, you must first press a buzzer on a keypad.

Two security 
cameras then whirr into action and a robotic U.S. voice says: ‘Please 
wait while your call is connected.’ The ‘call’ is answered by a member 
of staff. It’s not the sort of welcome Edingtonians are used to.

Locals fear Parsons will turn the village into a 'theme park' as he has bought several homes there and advertised it as a holiday destination on a website with pictures of various local activities

Linda is also unhappy about a 
footpath she uses to walk her Jack Russell, Holly. It crosses Mr Pike’s 
land, where she says a new sign has been erected ordering dog-walkers to
put their animal on a leash. ‘It’s made Holly depressed,’ she says.

Understandably, the furore is said to
have upset the Pikes. Their investment manager Giles Graves says: 
‘They’re devastated.

They’re investing because they want to use the 
house. As far as they’re concerned, they had gone through the proper 
channels.

‘They are providing jobs to local traders and businesses.’

Mr Pike has spent much of the summer abroad, and has refrained from commenting on the unrest.

No doubt he has the best of 
intentions in his development of Edington — but if he is planning to 
open up the village to the world, his guests might be a little 
disappointed.

Because Pike’s neighbours show no sign of backing down or 
of extending their usually warm welcome to any of his visitors.

Which would be a terrible shame, 
because as Linda puts it: ‘Without experiencing the people, they won’t 
really be experiencing Edington at all.’
