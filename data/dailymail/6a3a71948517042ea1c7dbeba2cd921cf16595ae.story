Airline Jetstar has come under fire for not providing a wheelchair to help a woman take her disabled sister from the plane to the terminal.

Perth woman Danae Florias and her sister 26 year old Marissa, who has cerebal palsy, had been on a holiday to Melbourne last month and were returning to Perth on Jetstar.

The woman was disgusted with the treatment her and her sister were shown by the airline, telling Nine News she was forced to carry her sister 100 metres to the terminal without a wheelchair.

Danae Florias (pictured right) was left fuming with Jetstar after she said she had to carry her disabled sister Marissa (pictured) from the plane to the terminal because there was no wheelchair and then had to assemble a wheelchair herself

It's believed the wheelchair was supposed to be there, but wasn't, and when she got to the terminal, she had to assemble a supplied wheelchair herself without any help from staff.

'Eventually my sister started crying, thinking they'd lost her wheelchair. She gets very anxious and upset easy so I couldn't calm her down,' said Ms Florias.

She told Nine News the airline failed to give her any answers as to why it had neglected them or even just point them in the right direction. 

'I feel so disgusted and disappointed,' she said. 

Ms Florias complained to the airline but did not receive a response until today. Jetstar confirmed they had contacted the customer this morning to apologise for the regrettable incident.

Jetstar have confirmed they have now contacted Ms Dorias and offered an apology and are investigating the matter

Jetstar said their customer service officer had a wheelchair on hand to assist with the customer’s transfer from the aircraft to the terminal but it did not meet her specific needs at Perth airport 

When Daily Mail contacted the airline, it said that other media had not told the whole story behind the incident.

'While our customer service officer had a wheelchair on hand to assist with the customer’s transfer from the aircraft to the terminal, we understand this did not meet her specific needs. He then offered to provide additional support,' said a spokesperson. 

In a statement the airline confirmed that it had advised Ms Florias that the investigation into the matter, and the ongoing chain of events, was ongoing.

'Every year Jetstar carries 60,000 passengers with specific needs,' said a Jetstar spokesperson.

'These reports are concerning and do not reflect the normal flight experience of our disabled passengers, many of whom fly with Jetstar often.'

'We apologise to the family for the distress involved and we're investigating how this occurred.'

An investigation is being held by Jetstar following the incident involving Danae Florias (pictured) and her 26 year old disabled sister Marissa. They have also apologised to her

This is the latest bungle in a series of incidents the airline has come under fire for of it's treatment of customers with a disabilities.

In 2009 the budget line upset three time Paralympic gold medallist Kurt Fearnley, who said he felt humiliated when the airline wouldn't allow him to use his own wheelchair.

And more recently, renowned Australian musician Jim Conway was left frustrated by the airline, unable to board a flight to Melbourne earlier this year, because it did not have measures in place to transfer him safely into his seat. 

Ms Florias told Nine news that she would never fly Jetstar again.
