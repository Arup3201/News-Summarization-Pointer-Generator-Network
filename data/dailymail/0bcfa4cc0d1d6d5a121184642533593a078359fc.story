Karen James, 47, was jailed for two years at Cardiff Crown Court after stealing £35,000 from her employer over a three-year period

A depressed GP manager stole £35,000 from her employer and spent the cash on beauty treatments to cheer herself up after racking up huge debts, a court heard.

Karen James, 47, was jailed for two years after pleading guilty to pocketing the money over a three-year period while managing the books and finances at Cyncoed Consulting Rooms in Cardiff, Wales.

She spent the money on a host of beauty treatments after racking up huge debts and becoming depressed when she split with her partner of 21 years, Cardiff Crown Court was told.

The court heard how it was James’ responsibility to look after the finances at the surgery, which was owned by five GPs who rented out space to other doctors and practitioners.

Prosecuting David Webster said: ‘It was her responsibility to bank the takings.

‘One of the doctors who used the rooms insisted his payments were in cash and paid his [room] rent in cash. Two others also paid cash.

‘The partners were content with her managing things and relied on her until one doctor became concerned about her work and £700 was found in the cash tin, waiting to be banked, when she went on annual leave.’

James, who lives rent-free with her mother in Newport, Wales while she tries to cope with her debts, blamed poor management at the consulting rooms.

Defence barrister Charles Rowe claimed the trusted administrator was out of her depth when she was promoted after just a year or two to manage the practice and said her 'responsibilities increased and tasks grew’.

He said: ‘The partners, because they trusted her, took an increasingly less keen interest in day-to-day management and she was left to run it with the staff she chose.

‘She was handling the cash, organising the payroll and salaries and renting out the rooms - she struggled and became utterly overwhelmed.

‘She was also battling with depression, breaking up from her partner of 21 years, caring for her mother and in debt.

‘Yes, she went for beauty treatments - put on her makeup, put on a smile and appeared to be a happy and successful woman - but underneath it was a different matter and her enormous debts were mounting.

‘She took out pay day loads and then turned to dishonesty.

‘The beauty treatments were just a short-term fix to try to make herself feel better.’

He and James disputed claims that the missing money totalled £51,493, saying there were discrepancies in some of the paperwork they had seen.

Following an adjournment in the hearing, the court was told a figure of £35,000 had been accepted by both sides for the purpose of sentencing James.

The mother-of-one initially denied 
stealing the money but changed her plea to guilty as soon as her 
daughter celebrated her 18th birthday.

Mr Rowe said: ‘Her daughter was only 17 at the time and once she had her birthday, James decided that was the time to face reality.

‘It was as if a weight had been lifted from her shoulders.

‘She has never been in trouble before, feels embarrassed, guilty and remorseful and intends to pay it back if she can.’

Sentencing James to two years in prison, recorder Paul Lewis QC said: ‘You stole cash intended to be banked, over a three-year period.’
