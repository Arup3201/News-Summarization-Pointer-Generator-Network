Boston marathon victims joined dozens of amputees to learn how to run with prosthetic legs, only six months after the bombing.

Celeste Corcoran, who lost both legs in the explosions at the marathon finish line, joined amputees, their families, volunteers and physical therapists at the Harvard athletic fields on a rainy Sunday morning.

Wearing her yellow ‘Boston Strong’ hat, Ms Corcoran navigated her way across the artificial turf on her artificial legs, a volunteer on each arm to keep her upright.

One of her assistants had a pair of prosthetics of his own.

Corcoran, pausing to choke back tears, said: ‘I've always wanted to be a runner but I used to get shin splints.

‘I don't have shins anymore, so I'm hoping.

‘Normally you walk around and you see everybody with two legs. Especially in the summertime - all you see is legs. 

‘It's easy to miss yours but when I see everybody here walking and running, it's OK.

‘I just want to be able to do the 
things that I did before. ... So many people have my back, I feel like I
can do it. I'm trying my hardest to enjoy being alive.'

Dozens
of amputees showed up at the Harvard athletic fields on a rainy Sunday 
morning to learn how to run - or run better - with prosthetic legs.

Corcoran, from Lowell, Massachusetts, wasn't much of a runner before, but she said she hopes that she will someday be able to join in a 5K or fun run. 

Her
daughter, Sydney Corcoran, 18, is wearing a matching yellow hat along 
with ankle-length tights that showed the effects of the shrapnel that 
scarred her legs but did not require amputation. She was on Boylston 
Street with her mother when the bombs went off, waiting for her aunt to 
finish the marathon.

Across the field, a boy with two prosthetic legs, no more than 4-years-old, was learning to kick a soccer ball with the carbon fibre blades. Two older boys wrestled playfully while the bigger one played keep-away with the younger's prosthesis.

Two-time Boston Marathon winner Joan 
Benoit Samuelson said at the start of the clinic: ‘The most inspiring 
stories are at the back of the pack. 

‘Our
motto is “There is no finish line.” There are always more challenges 
out there. You people who came out today are the spokesmen for those 
challenges.’

Organised by 
the Challenged Athletes Foundation, which helps amputees and others with
disabilities participate in sports, the clinic brought together 
marathon victims, those wounded in the military and other amputees. 

Coach
Bob Gailey ran them through a series of increasingly complicated 
drills, then lined them up for an obstacle course that was the highlight
of the day.

Similarly 
skilled participants match up in a relay race. Some runners fall; others
have trouble weaving through the cones or stepping around the ropes. 
But everyone cheered. 

One woman made her way through the lanes, saying aloud, with a smile: ‘I'm not going to fall this time.’

Another wore a T-shirt that said: ‘I am a Champutee.’

‘It's inspiring,’ said David Driscoll, a doctor who was working at the marathon's finish line medical tent on race day. Because his son, Brendan, was born with an incomplete tibia and fibula, the elder Driscoll has also volunteered with the Challenged Athletes Foundation. 

He said: ‘It's very enlightening to see them coming and to see they're overcoming that. It helps me, too, to work through it.

‘I don't say, “There, but for the grace of God, go I.” I say, “How can I be more like them.”' 

Many of those who lost legs on marathon day have been fitted for the heavy-duty prosthetics they call their everyday legs. Running is easier with the carbon-fibre blades - the ‘cheetah legs’ made familiar by Olympian Oscar Pistorius, but insurance often does not cover them.

The Knights of Columbus, which previously provided prosthetics for victims of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, have helped marathon victims get running legs or other prosthetics that help them regain a normal life. 

Knights of Columbus spokesman Andrew Walther said: ‘We can't let evil have the last word and that's why we focused on this group.’ 

For Heather Abbott, who had her left leg amputated after the marathon explosions that means four prosthetics: The everyday leg, a waterproof one for swimming, another that allows her to wear high heels, and the running leg she received Saturday. 

Abbott said: ‘I'm trying to do all the things I used to do.’

Ossur, the prosthetic-maker, donated the blade that serves as Abbott's new left foot. Next Step Bionics and Prosthetics took care of the rest of the prosthetics. The Challenged Athletes Foundation helps with training, with clinics like the one at Harvard on Sunday.

Next Step President Matthew Albuquerque said: ‘You can have a running prosthesis sitting in the closet. You have to be trained on it to have its full benefit. 

‘I can't tell you how great it is to provide these opportunities for people who never thought they were going to walk again to get out on the field. This is about making people feel good about themselves.’

Abbott stopped midway through the clinic to take off her prosthetic and check for blisters; everything was clear. Putting the leg back on involves a sleeve and a sock and a release valve and some hand sanitizer that's used as a lubricant to create a seal that holds the prosthesis in place. 

Losing a leg is a self-evident setback and while it's easy to see the damage to the limb it's not always obvious what other problems might come with it. For Roseann Sdoia, who has spent much of the time since Marathon Monday on one crutch or a cane, it can be anything that she needs two hands for, like taking laundry out of the dryer or making a bed.

Ms Sdoia, who lost her right leg above the knee, said her most recent problem was the emergence of blisters on her leg where it has been rubbing against the socket of her prosthetic. The sores prevented her from getting a running leg this week and left her little to do on Sunday other than sit and watch the clinic, crutches at her side. 

She said: ‘Today was going to be the day. 

‘I was excited to get it, because even if I only took two steps today, I'd take three steps tomorrow. 

‘But now,’ she said, sitting under a canopy to stay out of the rain, ‘I'm back to Square One, waiting.’

Two bombs were detonated near the finish line of the Boston marathon on April 15 this year, killing three people and injuring more than 260.

Authorities say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, ethnic Chechens from Russia who emigrated to the United States as children, planned and carried out the attack to retaliate against the United States for its involvement in Muslim countries. 

Tamerlan was killed four days after the marathon following a gun battle with police. 

Dzhokhar was found wounded and hiding in a boat in a backyard in Watertown. Authorities said he had scrawled anti-American messages on the inside of the boat, including 'The U.S. Government is killing our innocent civilians' and 'We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.'
