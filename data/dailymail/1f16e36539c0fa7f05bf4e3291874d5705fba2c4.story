Nicklas Bendtner may have struggled to find the back of the net for Wolfsburg, but the controversial Dane scored a spectacular scissor kick in training with the  national side.

The 26-year-old joined the German club in the summer and has failed to score in his first five outings for his new side, but the inconsistent forward reinforced his self-belief with a magnificent effort on the training ground.

Bendtner finally left the Gunners after nine years in north London, and Wolfsburg fans will be hoping his latest exploits will be a sign of things to come after a difficult start in the Bundesliga.
