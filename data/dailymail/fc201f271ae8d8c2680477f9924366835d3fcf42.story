The decaying wreckage of a Second World War fighter plane, exposed after 65 years by changing tides on the Welsh coast, is to be removed.

Known as the Maid of Harlech, the Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter aircraft was discovered in July 2007 after decades hidden under the sands. 

It was the first time the rare  United States Army Air Force (USAAF) fighter had been seen since it crashed off the Welsh coast in 1942 while on exercise.

Known as the Maid of Harlech, a Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter aircraft was discovered in July 2007 after 65 years hidden under the sands.  It will now be carefully removed from its secret location

The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) hope to be able to remove the wreckage from the sea

The
 retrieval, from a secret location near the beach near Harlech, Gwynedd,
 will move ahead as soon as a home for the aircraft is found.

Project director Ric Gillespie said: 'Once we have a home for the aircraft we can proceed with getting the necessary permissions from the local government, finalising the recovery plan and raising the all-important funding.

'Daunting, but do-able.'

He added: 'The plane remains safely buried in the sand. We know where it is, no one else does. 

'That's the only reason it hasn't been picked apart by looters. Our intention is to recover the aircraft and conserve rather than restore it.'

'That means a lengthy process of treating the metal so it doesn't corrode away when it is removed from the beach. 

'We need a UK museum to partner with us in conserving and then exhibiting the aircraft.'

'The
 major aviation museums such as the RAF museum and the Imperial War 
museum are aware and interested but unable to devote resources right now
 due to other commitments and shortages of space and funding.'

The P-38 Lightning in her former glory. It is believed that the aircraft crash landed in 1942 while it was taking part in training exercises and its engines cut out

It is believed that the aircraft crash landed in 1942 while it was taking part in training exercises and its engines cut out.

Amazingly pilot Lt Robert Elliott walked away from the incident 
without a scratch but tragically went missing in action just three 
months later serving in the American's Tunisia campaign in North Africa.

The TIGHAR website dedicated to the project describes the find as one of the most significant WWII related archaeological discoveries in recent history. 

Local historian Matt Rimmer first alerted TIGAR to the wreck's discovery and assisted the TIGHAR archaeological team throughout October 2007 carrying out a survey at the site.

Nicknamed 'the fork tailed devil' by 
the Germans- who recognised the aircraft as a formidable opponent - the 
P-38 entered service in 1941, with the US 1st Fighter Group.

They were in initially deployed to the 
West Coast to defend against an anticipated Japanese attack, but by 
1942, the majority of P-38 squadrons were sent to Britain as part of the
 Operation Bolero, when the US joined the war effort.

Others were sent to North Africa, where they aided the Allies in gaining control of skies over the Mediterranean.

In the Pacific, the P-38 served throughout the war and downed more Japanese aircraft 
than any other US Army Air Force fighter.

Back in Britain, the P-38 saw 
extensive service as a bomber escort thanks to its long range.

But it was plagued with engine issues due to the lower quality of European fuel.

On April 18, 1943, the aircraft flew 
one of its most famous missions.

Sixteen P-38Gs were sent from the tropical island of 
Guadalcanal to intercept transport carrying Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the Commander-in-Chief of 
the Japanese Combined Fleet, near 
Bougainville.

Flying just above the water surface, the P-38s succeeded in downing the admiral's plane as well as
 three others.

By the end of the war, the P-38 had downed more than 1,800 
Japanese aircraft, with more than100 pilots becoming aces in the process.
