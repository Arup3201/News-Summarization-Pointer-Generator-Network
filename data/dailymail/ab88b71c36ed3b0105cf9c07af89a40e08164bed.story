In the midst of the recent uprising of Islamic militants in Iraq - and the thousands of Iraqis they've slaughtered as they try to take over the violence-plagued country - former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz Cheney-Perry, a one-time assistant secretary of state, are speaking out about the series of 'wrong' decisions the Obama administration has made that made the uprising possible.

Last week, a group of Islamic extremists began an insurgency throughout Iraq and have taken over several cities - including Fallujah, Tikrit, Mosul and Tel Afar - on their way to Baghdad.

After saying he wouldn't send U.S. troops to the region, Obama sent 250 soldiers to guard the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.

Harsh: Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz - a former deputy assistant secretary of state - have harsh words for Obama's handling of the insurgency in Iraq

Jihad: Earlier this month, a jihadi group of Islamic militants called the Islamic States of Iraq and Syria began taking over cities in Iraq

The Cheneys oppose the president's plan for the uprising so far, and are critical of his actions before the uprisings that allowed the jihadi group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to grow.

'Rarely has a U.S. president been so wrong about so much at the expense 
of so many,' the Cheneys wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. 'Too many times to count, Mr. Obama has told us he is 
"ending" the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan—as though wishing made it so. 
His rhetoric has now come crashing into reality. Watching the black-clad
 ISIS jihadists take territory once secured by American blood is final 
proof, if any were needed, that America's enemies are not "decimated." 
They are emboldened and on the march.'

The Cheneys contend that the uprising in Iraq is not just a threat to Iraqis, but to Americans, as well, as the country could become a safe-haven for al Qaeda and other terrorist groups that could carry out 9/11-style attacks on the U.S. and its allies.

Fore! The Cheneys say that while the situation in Iraq escalates, Obama is playing golf and talking about climate change

The Cheneys mention trips they've been on to the Middle East, where government officials are confused as to what Obama has been doing in the region following the wars in Irag and Afghanistan, and say that the president is abandoning the few friends the U.S. has in the Arab world.

'In one Arab capital, a senior official pulled out a map of Syria and
 Iraq,' the Cheneys write. 'Drawing an arc with his finger from Raqqa province in northern 
Syria to Anbar province in western Iraq, he said, "They will control 
this territory. Al Qaeda is building safe havens and training camps 
here. Don't the Americans care?"

'Our president doesn't seem to. Iraq is at risk of falling to a radical 
Islamic terror group and Mr. Obama is talking climate change. Terrorists
 take control of more territory and resources than ever before in 
history, and he goes golfing. He seems blithely unaware, or indifferent 
to the fact, that a resurgent al Qaeda presents a clear and present 
danger to the United States of America.'

Brutal: ISIS crucified this man and left a note on his body saying 'Cleanliness is a civilized matter that shows ur ethics and love for country

Murderers: ISIS has reportedly driven through Iraqi cities and indiscriminately shot at random citizens

After the Iraq War, the Cheneys say al Qaeda was nearly defeated in the country thanks primarily to military efforts by the U.S. and its allies. Rather than stay in the country and make sure the peace was preserved, Obama pulled the U.S. out of the unfinished conflict, according to the Cheneys.

Mr. Obama had only to negotiate an agreement to leave behind some 
residual American forces, training and intelligence capabilities to help
 secure the peace. Instead, he abandoned Iraq and we are watching 
American defeat snatched from the jaws of victory.

The Cheneys cite a Rand study that shows a 58 percent increase in the number of Salafi-jihadists between 2010 and 2013. They say that 'in the face of this threat, Mr. Obama is busy ushering America's adversaries into positions of power in the Middle East.'

'First it was the Russians in Syria. Now, in a move that defies 
credulity, he toys with the idea of ushering Iran into Iraq,' they write. 'Only a fool
 would believe American policy in Iraq should be ceded to Iran, the 
world's largest state sponsor of terror.'

Violence: The number of Iraqis executed by ISIS since the uprising began is in the thousands

They write that there is 'a dire need for American leadership around the world' and that the president has failed our allies by abandoning conflicts before they are actually over.

'It is time the president and his allies faced some hard truths: America 
remains at war, and withdrawing troops from the field of battle while 
our enemies stay in the fight does not "end" wars. Weakness and retreat 
are provocative. U.S. withdrawal from the world is disastrous and puts 
our own security at risk,' the Cheneys write. 

They went on to quote former President - and conservative hero - Ronald Reagan.

In 1983, President Ronald Reagan said, "If history teaches anything, it 
teaches that simple-minded appeasement or wishful thinking about our 
adversaries is folly. It means the betrayal of our past, the squandering
 of our freedom." President Obama is on track to securing his legacy as 
the man who betrayed our past and squandered our freedom.
