A 43-year-old mother has died in a house fire in Mount Helen, near Ballarat.

Police originally feared the woman and her son and daughter, both 21, had died in the blaze but they have been safely located, theÂ Ballarat Courier reported.

A neighbour said she heard a 'whooshing' noise like a firecracker and a loud explosion before the fire started at about 1.30am on Friday.

Two women and a man feared dead in house fire at Mount Helen, Victoria

Next-door neighbour Margaret Bell witnessed the explosion and called 000.

'I got up to grab a drink of water and I went back to bed,' Ms Bell told Daily Mail Australia.

'Then I heard a noise, you know how when a firecracker goes off it makes that whooshing sort of a noise, then that stopped and I heard a big explosion.'

Ms Bell got out of bed and looked out her window to see the house in flames so she called the fire service.

She added that the family had moved to Mount Helen from Ballarat just over one week ago.

'I'd spoken to the lady and her son, she was telling me a bit about herself,' she said.

A body has reportedly been found but not identified and a mother, 43, and her son and daughter, both 21, are still unaccounted for

'They'd moved out here because it's nice and quiet out here.

'It's really sad to think they might have been in the house.'

Detective senior sergeant Dave Hermit said two dogs were found dead at the property.

The fire took 20 firefighters 90 minutes to bring under control, and the house was completely destroyed.

Country Fire Authority operations officer Kade Dowie said investigators believed the family were in the process of moving into the home.

'Investigations are continuing but the story from the neighbours is that they'd only recently moved in, as in last weekend,' Mr Dowie told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Dowie said the scene was handed over to the police forensics and arson squad on Friday morning but crews struggled to access inside the property.

'The intensity of the fire caused the ceiling and roof to collapse, which is causing difficulty with extinguishing and accessing,' he said.

The cause of the fire is not yet known.
