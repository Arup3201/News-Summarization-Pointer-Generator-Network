Experimental: Artist Olafur Eliasson has created the bizarre 'Take A Deep Breath' art work which could be part of the London 2012 Festival

It is a suggestion likely to cause sharp intakes of breath all round.

An artist wants £1million of public money to fund a bizarre project asking people to ‘take a deep breath’ in aid of the Olympics.

Participants will be encouraged to inhale and exhale on behalf of ‘a person, a movement or a cause’ and then share details of the experience on a website.

The concept will apparently promote ‘interconnectivity’ rather than rivalry, challenging the ‘egocentricity’ of the Games.

It has been proposed by Berlin-based artist Olafur Eliasson, whose previous work has involved putting a giant sun in the Tate Modern.

But despite being earmarked for inclusion at the London 2012 Festival – an Olympics-based arts celebration running from June to September – his new project rails against the event.

In a video about the commission,  the Danish-Icelandic artist apparently said: ‘The Olympics reflect the state of the world – the obsession with elite, the obsession with winners, rather than participatory ideas. I was asked by the Olympics to make a work of art that celebrates the Olympics.

‘There’s not a lot to celebrate in the
Olympics and I thought I would make a work of art that exposes some of 
the weaknesses of the Olympics.’

Mr Eliasson, 44, has applied to the 
Olympic Lottery Distributor (OLD) for £1million – although it is not 
known why such a large sum is needed for the website-based project, 
called simply Take A Deep Breath.

OLD is a body set up to support Olympics projects using money raised by the National Lottery.

Previous work: Mr Eliasson created 'The Weather Project' which beamed a giant sun across the Tate Modern

According to the artist, participants 
would be asked to take a deep breath and then post a message on a 
website about who they did it for and why. A film of people inhaling and
exhaling could also be created.

Each ‘breath bubble’ would form a 
virtual ‘bubble Earth’ creating ‘a world map defined by shared 
aspirations and dreams, rather than national borders’, Mr Eliasson said.

Incredibly, the artist hopes 10 per cent of the Earth’s population – 700million people – would take part.

Last night Emma Boon, of the 
TaxPayers’ Alliance, said the project would certainly ‘win a gold medal 
in the money-wasting event’.

‘At a time when budgets are tight and many 
households are struggling, it doesn’t seem right to spend so much public
money on this concept,’ she said.

Olympics organisers Locog insisted the plan was ‘still in development and subject to funding’.

A spokesperson said: 'In late 2011 Manchester International Festival were brought in to produce this project; CREATE are also involved as partners with curatorial support from the Serpentine Gallery.'

And Ian Brack, chief executive of the 
OLD, said: ‘We have pledged £16.5million of funding for the Cultural 
Olympiad, and Mr Eliasson’s application would come from this.

‘Our board will now decide whether they are prepared to let their money be used for this purpose.’

Mr Eliasson declined to comment.

Legacy: Examples of the inhalations and exhalations could be kept in a 'permanent archive capsule' near the Olympic Stadium if the project is approved
