Hero: Cristina Torre, pictured in 2005, caught the baby in her arms when he fell from a shop awning

It was the catch of a lifetime.

The daughter of former Yankee legend Joe Torre caught a baby who was dangling from the awning of a building in Brooklyn on Wednesday.

Cristina Torre, 44, spotted the 1-year-old boy hanging from the front of a store on 3rd Avenue and 92nd street at around 10 a.m.

As she was calling 911, the baby fell, but he landed safety in Torre's outstretched arms, witnesses said.

'The woman caught the baby,' onlooker Kristen Bramsen, 48, told The New York Daily News. 'The baby was shaken. Everyone was going up to the woman and hugging her. I hugged her.'

She added in an interview with The New York Post: 'I really think the baby would have been dead if it wasn't for the woman.'

Police later determined the little boy, whose name hasn't been revealed, slipped through an open window after pushing out a piece of cardboard that had been placed next to an air conditioner at his second floor apartment.

According to The Post, the parents were fast asleep when the child fell, though both - Sam Miller, 23, and Tiffany Demetria, 24 - were handcuffed and taken into custody by police after the frightening incident.

'It took a long time for them to get to the parents. I looked over and the father was on the ground clutching his heart,' Bramsen told The Post.

They face charges of endangering the welfare of a child and neglect and their three other children, aged 2, 3 and 5, have been placed in state care.

A neighbor described the parents as 'gypsies' who regularly read tarot cards in the street.

The baby was taken to Lutheran Hospital though just for observation.

At Yankee Stadium on Wednesday, Joe Torre told The Post his daughter's magic catch was as good as anything he'd ever accomplished while managing the Yankees between 1996 and 2007.

'No question this ranks right up there with all that's happened to me,' said the 72-year-old who brought the team to four World Series titles and is now MLB's executive vice president of baseball operations.

'Your children, that's your proudest moments and when they are responsible and caring and all that stuff it is a proud moment, especially in today's world where we seem to glorify bad things. I am just so proud of her.'

He added that while his daughter didn't play a lot of sports growing up 'she always had good hands.'

Joe Torre had a more than 17-year career as a catcher, first baseman and third baseman for teams including the Atlanta Braves, the New York Mets and the St. Louis Cardinals.
