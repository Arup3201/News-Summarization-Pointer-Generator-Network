A woman has come forward claiming to be the secret fiancee of New York Giants No. 1 draft pick Odell Beckham Jr, spreading stories of alleged dalliances with strippers and saying he had a love child while dating her.

The NFL is now said to be investigating the claims against the 21-year-old rookie, who just inked a four year deal with the Giants worth $10.4 million deal with the team, including a $5.9 million signing bonus.

He says the 'entire story is fabricated'.

'I have never been engaged, I don't have any children and I have never met this person who is making these claims,' Beckham said in a statement to The New York Daily News.

Fiancee?: Erica Mendez, 19, claims she has been dating New York Odell Beckham Jr since 2010, that he cheated on her with two strippers and has a love child

O'Dell Beckham Jr.  formerly played for the LSU Tigers. He says he has never met Erica Mendez and that nothing she says is true

The woman, Erica Mendez, is a 19-year-old self-described model and personal trainer from Texas.

She told RadarOnline she has been dating Beckham since November 2010, when they were both teenagers, saying the LSU star 'swept me off my feet'.

'I had come from a broken home and was looking for stability,' she said.

'He treated me like a queen.'

Mendez said Beckham showered them

showering her with gifts including a new BMW and jetting her to Paris and London, she said.

Then she discovered he was cheating on her — and had a love child from one fling, she said.

During one alleged angry text exchange between the pair, Odell supposedly writes, 'U ain’t never believe anything I say!’ and she replies, 'Why is that? I believed that you were faithful and you had a child on me? Did u fall on your head lately Odelliee?’

Mendez told Radar: 'We fought about the child, but he claimed he was a changed man. I wanted so badly to believe him, so I stuck around.'

She said she then became pregnant in February 2013.

But the stress of trying to deal with his cheating was too much, and she suffered a miscarriage, Mendez said.

The pair bonded over their loss, she told Radar, and he proposed to her.

'He promised to change and that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. Too bad it was all just lies,' Mendez said.

She said she walked into his parents’ home in New Orleans in August 2013, shortly after they were engaged, and found him in a 'sexually compromising position’' with two strippers.

'There were glasses thrown. It was quite a commotion,' she said.

'That was the final straw.'

During one alleged text exchange between the pair, she wrote, 'Soo you’re still going to act like you did nothing wrong? Even now?'

'What u talkin bout now???' he allegedly replied.

Eva Mendez came forward with her claims just days after Beckham was selected for the NFL draft

'Umm, when I walked in and you had the two strippers in the bed that we slept in Odell. Forgot?’ Mendez retorted.

'Look I ain’t tryin talk about that sh-ttt. You wasn’t complaining after I sent you and ya mom to Cozumel,’' Odell supposedly snipped.

But bizarrely, she told the Web site that the couple recently reconciled — and the wedding’s still on for next March.

'We love each other,” she said. “Everybody makes mistakes. He has promised he has changed. I have faith in him.'

Odell’s dad, Odell Beckham Sr., told The Post that the family has hired a private investigator to try to track the woman down.

'This is just a made-up, fictitious individual,’' Beckham Sr. said.

Erica Mendez is a 19-year-old self-described model and personal trainer from Texas who claims to be the fiancee of Odell Beckham Jr.

'It’s a hoax. … She’s just a kid who came out of nowhere, and we’re like, ''Who is this?''

The dad said both he and Odell’s mom “are really into our son’s life.

'We know who he dates, who his girlfriend is. It’s not anyone named Erica,’ the dad said.

'He’s actually seeing a young lady who went to Alabama.’

'The only child he has is a pit bull named Dre, about 2 years old. That’s the son he raised.'

A Giants spokesman said the NFL was involved.

'The organization has contacted NFL security to look into finding the person responsible and to help investigate the matter’ he said.
