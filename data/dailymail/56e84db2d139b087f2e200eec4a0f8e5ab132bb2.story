Grimsby was first targeted by Benefits Street producers as the setting for new a welfare scroungers documentary.

Now the Lincolnshire fishing town has been given the Borat treatment  - becoming the inspiration for Sacha Baron Cohen's new film about football hooligans and binge drinkers.

The comedian, who rose to fame after playing fake rapper Ali G, has started production for the new project which is set to be released in 2015.

But the move has prompted criticism because locals believe the town's name is being used in 'bad light' and will have a negative impact on the local economy.

 Lincolnshire town and is about football hooligans

The 42-year old actor, who has also played the controversial roles of Bruno and The Dictator, has been spotted around Tilbury with film crews.

The Essex town has been transformed into Grimsby for filming, with road signs and restaurant names being changed and mock discount shops being set up to represent the Lincolnshire community in the 1980s. 

The plot is based on a covert agent who is forced to go on the run and join his brother, who happens to be a footballer.

Scenes with men urinating from windows and scantily-clad women swigging from beer cans on the street have already been completed. 

Children are also filmed being offered beer cans while wheeling drunken men in their prams outside boarded-up store fronts. 

North East Lincolnshire Councillor Matthew Brown told Mail Online he is 'disappointed' with the project because anything associated with football hooligans is negative.

He said: 'It is using the town's name in potentially a poor light. What also worries me is that there is no benefit to the local economy which is carrying the town's name.

'Anything that you associate with football hooliganism is going to be negative, but I hope people will be open-minded when they watch the film. 

He added that depicting Grimsby as a town which has a history of football violence is wrong.

'My view is quite simple. We don't have a massive issue with hooliganism. There is very good stewarding at the ground. In general we are not in the same category as other clubs like Millwall who have a history of it.

'Sacha Baron Cohen visited the area when he watch Grimbsy Town and I understand the fans treated him well.

'We cannot comment until we have watched the film. But I hope those fans are not abused.' 

Residents in Grimsby have recently risen up against Channel 4, after their attempt to make it the new location of 'poverty porn'.

Camera crews from the producers of controversial series Skint were seen scouting and 'test filming' on the Nunsthorpe estate since before Christmas. 

It followed the first season of Benefits Street which last year caused great upset in nearby Scunthorpe, where drug users and benefits claimants were filmed on the town’s Westcliff estate.

In 2012, the Surrey town of Staines officially changed its name to Staines-upon-Thames in an attempt to boost its image after one of Baron Cohen's films. 

Councillors voted for the change after the area became synonymous with spoof rapper Ali G.

Spelthorne Borough Council made the change to attract more business to the town, which sits on the banks of the River Thames. 

The long-debated revamp of the Surrey town prompted a day of celebrations from maypole dancing to a regatta as the town set out to prove it was more glamorous than its M25 commuter-belt image.

Elton John once sang: 'Oh England you´re fair. But there´s none to compare with my Grimsby.' 

It was once the biggest fishing port in the world, but the EU Common Fisheries Policy meant production slowed and now only a handful of boats travel from the docks.  

The town on the banks of the Humber was founded by Danish fishermen in the 9th Century and grew to become the world's largest fishing port in the 1980s.

It benefited from the industrial revolution in the 19th Century, with train links making it easier to transport goods to and from the port.  

In 1970 around 400 trawlers were based in the port, by 2013 only 5 trawlers were based there, three times less than the number which maintain offshore wind farms in the North Sea.

The industry was killed by the Icelandic cod wars of the early Seventies and the EU’s legilstaion.

The town still has the largest fish market in the UK, but most of what is sold is now brought overland from other ports or

Of the 18,000 tonnes of fresh fish sold in Grimsby fish market in 2012, almost 13,000 tonnes, mainly cod and haddock came from Iceland.
