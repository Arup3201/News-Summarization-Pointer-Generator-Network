Steven Gerrard is set to miss the next crucial phase of Liverpool's season after tweaking his hamstring during the victory over Tottenham Hotspur.

Liverpool's captain came off in the second half of a 3-2 win that has bolstered his side's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League but he is now almost certain to miss the next Barclays Premier League fixture at Southampton on February 22.

Aside from that, Gerrard is also set to be ruled out of this weekend's FA Cup tie against Crystal Palace and, in probability, the Europa League last 32 assignment against Besiktas but Liverpool hope the 34-year-old will be available to face Manchester City on March 1.

It is another headache for manager Brendan Rodgers, who only 48 hours earlier discovered that Lucas Leiva will miss between four to six weeks with a damaged thigh.

Better news, though, is the sustained improvement in Daniel Sturridge's fitness and and the England striker took another step in the right direction against Tottenham. 

He was frustrated not to score but that tempered by his delight at seeing Mario Balotelli finally create some positive headlines for himself.

Balotelli's best game for Liverpool came alongside Sturridge at White Hart Lane on his debut last August and the 25-year-old believes they can combine as a pair going forward.

Sturridge said: 'He's been waiting for a while to break his duck and been working very hard in training, and now he has scored one in the league I am sure things will start to go his way now.

'For me it's always about trying to help players who are here, not just Mario, but all the boys who are at the club. It's not easy to settle into a new team, a new area, a new lifestyle, with different people around you and so on and so forth.

'People don't ever take that into account. I just try to do my bit, although I'm not taking any credit for him scoring – I'm just happy he did.'

Sturridge added: 'Whatever team the manager chooses to put out I will do my best whoever I have a partnership with. I try to adapt to whoever I am playing with and bring out the best in each other, and we (me and Mario) click when we are playing together.'
