While alleged balcony murderer Gable Tostee might be out on bail, Queensland Police have requested assistance from dating app Tinder to help gather evidence for his prosecution.

Tostee, 28, left a Brisbane prison on bail last week, three months after he was arrested for the alleged murder of Warriena Wright in Surfers Paradise.

The US administrators of Tinder are being pushed by Australian authorities to aid their search for more than 50 women from Australia and overseas who were allegedly contacted by Mr Tostee via the app.

Bail documents indicate that investigators are pursuing statements from the women and have requested data from both Mr Tostee and Ms Wright's Tinder accounts, reported The Australian. 

Ms Wright died at around 2.20am, just hours after meeting Mr Tostee at Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise via the mobile dating app. 

The information provided by the women could prove a crucial element of the case against Mr Tostee, with Gold Coast Police Prosecutions legal division sergeant Michael Campbell labelling Mr Tostee's contact with 'persons over the dating site' as 'substantial'.

In an email to Mr Tostee's lawyers, Sergeant Campbell said that 'Police conducted extensive inquiries in relation to the defendant's' actions on Tinder.

Sergeant Campbell noted that while the majority of witness statements for the case had already been collected, police were still chasing 50 outstanding statements from witnesses interstate and overseas. 

The revelation follows Mr Tostee's release on strict bail conditions, which include an alcohol ban, treatment for alcohol abuse, random breath testing and abstinence from not only Tinder, but all social media to try to meet up with women. 

A photo released to Daily Mail Australia shows a post Mr Tostee loaded onto the Facebook page 'Hottest/beautiful teenagers', with the caption: 'I am feeling ultra sexy today cus I just got a new haircut. It gets me all kinds of pu**y. My friends have the same haircut cus they saw all the ass I pull and well, they get lots of pu**y too.'

The photo was posted to the page in January of this year, with Mr Tostee commenting later 'I took this photo with my d**k'.

Tostee has been in custody at the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre since he was arrested in mid-August and charged with murdering New Zealand woman, Warriena Wright, who fell to her death from his 14th floor apartment on August 8.  

At his bail hearing, prosecutors alleged he locked 26-year-old victim Warriena Wright outside on a 14th floor balcony and that was akin to locking someone in a trunk to suffocate.

Strict conditions: Gable Tostee will live at his parents, Gary and Helene's house (pictured) while on bail, not drink alcohol, not use dating app Tinder and be under a 6pm to 6am curfew

Justice  Mullins told the court the case 'is not in any view a straightforward case of murder'.

The 28-year-old will spend at least the next 14 months awaiting trial at his parents home at Carrara, west of Surfers Paradise, and is not expected to stand trial until at least 2016. 

Mr and Mrs Tostee, who were in the Brisbane Supreme Court for the decision, have put up a $200,000 surety to reduce the flight risk of their 28-year-old son.   

Granting Tostee bail, Justice Debra Mullins said the strict conditions imposed on him would reduce the risk of him fleeing. 

‘I am satisfied the applicant has shown cause as to why his detention in custody is not justified,’ Justice Mullins said.

Crown prosecutor Ben Power argued there was a strong risk Tostee would flee with the threat of a mandatory 20-year prison sentence looming.

But defence barrister Soraya Ryan argued Tostee's public profile meant he couldn't hide from authorities.   

Mr Tostee denies he murdered Ms Wright. Mr Tostee appointed Mr O'Gorman following the civil libertarian's comments about the release of court documents including an alleged transcript of Ms Wright's night with him, taped on his phone, and a damning police affidavit of what occurred between the two in the hours before Ms Wright's death. 

The prosecution claims Tostee has a ‘bizarre indifference to Ms Wright's death’ and that she had been affected on the night of her death by alcohol in the form of a ‘white spirit’ made by him.

Justice Mullins has made mention during the hearing of the accused’s autism and social anxiety.
