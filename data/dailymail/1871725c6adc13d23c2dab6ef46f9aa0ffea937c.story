North Korea's next leader appeared to embrace a warming of relations with the country's cross-border foes by welcoming a party of South Korean delegates to his father's memorial.

Kim Jong Un met a former South Korean first lady and a prominent business leader as he visited the body of Kim Jong Il for the fourth time since the his father's death.

Clearly emotional, Kim wiped tears from his eyes while paying his respects at the Kumsusan Memorial Palace in Pynongyang yesterday.

During
Kim's meeting with the private delegation of South Koreans, he thanked 
them after they expressed condolences and sympathy over his father's 
death.

The lead delegates 
were the widow of former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, who 
engineered a 'sunshine' engagement policy with the North and held a 
landmark summit with Kim Jong Il in 2000, and Hyundai Group Chairwoman 
Hyun Jeong-eun, whose late husband had ties to the North. North Korea 
sent delegations to Seoul when the women's husbands died.

They stood in a line on a red carpet
and bowed silently during their visit to the Kumsusan palace, where Kim
Jong Il's bier is surrounded by flowers and flanked by an honor guard, 
footage from AP Television News in Pyongyang showed.

Kim
Jong Un and the two women later exchanged handshakes and clasped their 
hands when they had brief conversations. Their conversations were 
inaudible.

Through the 
meeting, Kim appeared to be sending a message pushing South Korea to 
pursue previously agreed upon cooperative projects that would give his 
country much-needed hard currency, said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at 
Seoul-based University of North Korean Studies.

Monday's meeting appeared to be Kim's first meeting with South Koreans since his father's death.

It
was also the fourth time the North's media reported that Kim had 
visited the memorial palace since his father's death, according to 
Seoul's Unification Ministry.

It seems clear now that Kim Jong Un, 
who is in his late 20s, is now in position to extend the Kim family's 
control over the country of 24million people to a third generation.

Late 
Monday, Pyongyang called Kim a 'sagacious leader' and 'dear' comrade as 
he again paid respects to his father, whose body is lying in state at 
Kumsusan Memorial Palace.

State media have already dubbed him as a 'great successor' and 'outstanding leader.'

The official Korean Central News Agency also indicated that Kim will uphold his father's 'military-first' policy.

'As
dear comrade Kim Jong Un, who is a sagacious leader of our party, state
and military, is at the forefront of our revolutionary cause, the 
history of our father and general's glorious military-first revolution 
will continue,' it said.

His grandfather Kim Il Sung, a revered
figure, founded North Korea in 1948 and was succeeded by Kim Jong Il, 
who ruled for 17 years.

Just as North Korea created a 
cult of personality around the previous two Kims, the youngest Kim has 
also been showered with intense praise and new titles in the state 
media.

The main Rodong Sinmun newspaper 
described him Monday as head of the Central Committee of the Workers' 
Party - a post that appears to make him the top official in the ruling 
party.

Earlier, the 
North referred to him as 'supreme leader' of the 1.2 million-strong 
armed forces and said the military's top leaders had pledged their 
loyalty to him.

On Tuesday, the two lead South Korean 
delegates met Kim Yong Nam, president of Presidium of North Korea's 
parliament, who often represents the country and is considered a nominal
head of state, according to the APTN footage. The delegates were to 
return to South Korea later today.

Kim Jong Un's new titles are slight variations of those held by his father, but appear to carry the same weight. It was unclear whether the nation's constitution had been changed to reflect the transfer of leadership as when Kim Jong Il took power after his father's death.

Mourning continued, meanwhile, despite frigid winter weather, in the final days before Kim Jong Il's funeral, which is set to take place Wednesday, and a memorial Thursday.

People continued lining up in central Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square, where a massive portrait that usually features Kim Il Sung has been replaced by one of Kim Jong Il, to bow before his smiling image and to lay funeral flowers.

Heated buses stood by to give mourners a respite from the cold, and hot tea and water were distributed from beverage kiosks.

The funeral of Kim Jong Il will be watched closely for clues to who will gain power and who will fall out of favour under the next leader, his son Kim Jong Un.

However the state ceremonies over Wednesday and Thursday are also likely to bear the hallmarks of Kim Jong Il's rule, including more of a military presence for the man who elevated the armed forces as part of his "songun," or "military first," policy.

Kim, who has been lying in state since he died on December 17, celebrated major occasions with lavish, meticulously choreographed parades designed to show off the nation's military might, such as the October 2010 display when he introduced his son and anointed successor to the world.

"A display of weapons may also be a way to demonstrate that the military remains loyal to the succession process," said Ahn Chan-il of the World Institute for North Korea Studies in South Korea. "There may even be a small-scale military parade involving aeroplanes."

Like his father was when former leader Kim Il Sung died in 1994, Kim Jong Un has been stoic in a dark blue Mao-style suit in mourning period appearances - but so far without the black armband that Kim Jong Il wore at the funeral to mark him as head mourner.
