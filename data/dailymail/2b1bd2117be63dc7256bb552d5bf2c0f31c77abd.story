An Irish pilot who died over the weekend had been helping out at a charity event, just moments before his plane plunged into the sea in New York.

Cyril McLavin, from Co. Westmeath, Ireland, saved up for years to own a plane, and only bought the small aircraft during the summer.

The 51-year-old and his friend, who was also killed, had spent the day at a charity event at Brookhaven Airport, giving children rides along the runway. A friend yesterday said planes had been Mr McLavin’s ‘one passion in life’.

Operation: Emergency workers spent hours looking for Cyril McLavin and his friend after their plane crashed into the sea in New York

Just a few minutes after they left the airport, the two plane enthusiasts got into difficulty – a fisherman who witnessed the crash from the ground said it was clear they were in trouble.

‘You could see he was in panic mode because the engine was just sputtering,’ the fisherman said. ‘When he hit [there was] a very loud noise.’

He told CBS News in the US that he was one of a number of people who frantically tried to help the two men by tying a rope to the plane in a bid to stop it from sinking in the Moriches Inlet in Long Island.

And while he and a number of other men tried this, people in boats tried desperately to open the doors to the cockpit to rescue the men.

Witnesses say the two men were unconscious as the frantic rescue attempts were under way around them.

Unfortunately the plane continued to sink and by the time the emergency crews arrived, the 1946 Globe GC-1A had sunk to a depth of around 20ft.

Susan Spadaro, owner of the nearby Spadaro Airport, told the New York Post that McLavin and 72-year-old Dr Andrew Messana were long-time friends and fliers.

‘The only reason they took the plane out was to help at the event,’ Miss Spadaro said.

'One passion in life': Cyril McLavin saved up for years to own a plane, and only bought the small aircraft during the summer

‘We had them for lunch, and then they took off. A few minutes later, they were gone. They were great guys and loved to fly.’

She said that Mr McLavin had ‘saved for years’ to buy his plane and added: ‘He was so proud of it. He just bought it in July.’

Mr McLavin, who emigrated to the US in the Eighties from the village of Dysart, Co. Westmeath, was working as a building maintenance contractor, and living in the Queens area of New York.

Former school friend Frank Tiernan told Midlands 103 radio yesterday that he remembers a true aviation enthusiast.

He said: ‘From the time we were at school, Cyril had one passion in life and that was aviation and planes.

‘What makes me remember this is that when you look back at the Eighties, aviation was probably what space travel is now.

‘But for most of us it was cars and maybe country boys tractors that we were more into.

‘But once there was a plane around, Cyril knew by the noise of it what type it was and what was powering it.’

His aunt Mary McLavin said: ‘He absolutely loved flying so we take comfort in the fact that he died doing what he loved.

‘He died happy as he was in his beloved plane.’

The chairman of St Malachy’s GAA Westmeath added that it was ‘his passion in life’.

Investigators are still unsure about what exactly caused the plane to come down on Saturday at around 3pm.

The bodies were recovered late on Saturday night. Heavy tides are said to have hampered the rescue efforts as divers tried to get to the cockpit.

Two teams of three divers spent more than five hours trying to get to the men but were unsuccessful.

The crash is being investigated by the US’s National Transportation Safety Board.

A resident of Mc McLavin’s home village of Dysart said last night: ‘I don’t remember much of him since he left, except that he did come back for two family funerals.

‘I know he left in the Eighties but other than the funerals, he hardly came back – as far as I know. The lads who knew him though said that he was big into his planes.’

Mr McLavin left St Mary’s Christian Brothers School in 1978 and then graduated from Athlone Regional College in 1979. He emigrated shortly after.

Mr McLavin is survived by a younger brother, and it was not clear last night what the funeral arrangements will be.
