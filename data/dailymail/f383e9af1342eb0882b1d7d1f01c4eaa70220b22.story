the State Department set aside a staggering $11,519,617 on hotels and ground transportation costs for President Obama and his entourage to attend Nelson Mandela's memorial service last week, it was revealed today.

One contract letter budgeted more than $8.2 million for 'passenger vehicles, SUVs, vans, and buses, as well as supplies and goods vehicles such as pickup trucks, box trucks, and larger capacity vehicles,' according to documents first posted online by the Weekly Standard.

Two more authorized State to spend in excess of $3.2 million on hotels from December 6 to January 20, including costs for a whopping 5,730 'hotel room nights' overall – a number that works out to represent more than 127 separate rooms.

It's unclear how much the State Department actually spent. But the president, it turned out, spent less
 than 13 hours on the ground in South Africa on December 10 – arriving 
and departing on the same day.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

The shot worth $11m: While Obama gave an address at Mandela's memorial it will always be remembered for this picture. It emerged today for that publicity, the Obama administration was prepared to pony up $11.5 million

The 'beast,' a one-of-a-kind armored SUV that ferries the president around while he's overseas, was brought to South Africa for him -- and its operating costs weren't included in the travel estimates

No-shows: The Obamas did not attend Mandela's actual funeral on Dec. 15, and The Clintons -- who were on the guest list -- never turned up either

It's also unclear whether he or anyone else checked into either of the two hotels named in the contracting documents.

Neither Europcar, the rental agency slated to receive the millions for vehicle rental, nor the two hotels named in the State Department authorizations – the Radisson Blu Gautrain and Michaelangelo hotels – would comment on whether they provided services to the U.S. government, or how much they were paid.

The State Department also declined to answer questions about the costs of Obama's trip, referring them to the White House.

An administration official told MailOnline that it was 'highly unlikely that anyone will be commenting about the president's travel arrangements, considering all the security precautions involved.'

When President and Mrs. Obama traveled to South Africa for the Mandela memorial this month, they traveled with administration officials, dignitaries, Secret Service details, a U.S. Air Force contingent and dozens of journalists:

The Clintons returned on their own after Air Force One departed for Washington; media organizations pay for their correspondents' travel lexpenses.

Twenty-three members of Congress also attended. While they traveled on a separate plane, their expenses on the ground were reportedly covered by the State Department.

'But federal procurement procedures are what they are, and that's just a system everyone has to work with.'

Those procedures are notoriously complex and often involve outlining worst-case scenarios, but it's unlikely anyone would have needed hotel rooms in Johannesburg through the middle of January.

Two State Department procurement officers failed to respond to requests for comment about how many taxpayer dollars were actually spent on the excursion.

But they also identified four other hotels that met the security and meeting facility requirements of the White House. They included a second Radisson, a Park Inn and a Holiday Inn, all in central Johannesburg near Nelson Mandela Square.

None of the awards was open to competitive bidding; the State Department cited 'security concerns' that 'prohibit sufficient advanced notification of VIP travel to allow for sufficient time to conduct full and open competition.'

While Mandela's death and memorial service unfolded less than a week apart, the South African anti-apartheid icon was in ill health for more than a year, providing State ample time to plan ahead for contingencies.

The contract award document for ground transportation noted that the State Department conducted a 'limited market survey' in 2012, anticipating that it would need logistical support when Mandela finally succumbed to his illnesses.

Pricey! When Air Force One took off for South Africa from Andrews Air Force Base, it cost the Defense Department nearly $180,000 per hour to operate -- costs that also weren't included in the $11.5 million travel budget

Entourage: In addition to the first lady, Obama brought along former President George W. Bush, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and other dignitaries

Spitting distance: Thamsanqa Jantjie, the mentally unbalanced and violent phony sign-language interpreter, got close enough to President Obama to do him harm

Mandela was laid to rest at his 
family home near the South African town of Qunu on December 15. The 
Obamas were not slated to attend, but Bill and Hillary Clinton were: 
They were ultimately no-shows.

Rev.
 Jesse Jackson, a long-time civil rights movement icon and one-time U.S.
 presidential candidate, was the most prominent American guest at the 
ceremony.

The contracts were not open to competitive bidding due to the last-minute nature of travel to a foreign country for a head of state's funeral. The president's unique security requirements when traveling also tend to disqualify most hotels and car services.

Obama's armored limousine and emergency helicopter, for instance, typically travel on a military cargo plane that accompanies Air Force One.

The president's flagship aircraft itself costs $179,750 per hour to operate, according to a Congressional Research Service report published in May 2012.

Somehow the Secret Service's security concerns didn't keep Thamsanqa Jantjie, the infamous fake sign-language interpreter, from standing just feet away from the president during his remarks at Mandela's widely broadcast memorial service.

Jantjie, who was hospitalized following a reported nervous breakdown on Thursday, had a history of mental illness and violent crime leading up to his global moment of fame translating Obama's words as 'rocking horses' and 'shrimp' as millions of deaf people looked on in disbelief.
