A Florida girl who survived a swing set injury in 2007 died on Monday.

Lexi Antorino, 8, of Palmetto suffered severe head injuries when a swing set fell on top of her, according to a report by the Bradenton Herald. She died at 11:30am at All-Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg, less than a month before her 9th birthday.

Family: Lexi is seen here in a 2008 file photo with her brother Nick Jr.

Antorino's parents, Sarah and Nick, took care of her with the help of family and friends as their daughter was 'semi-comatose' and required both constant care and the use of a ventilator, the paper reported.

'She's touched so many lives and brought people closer to God,' Sarah Antorino told the paper. 'She showed people how to fight. She was a little fighter. She gave people strength. She made me realize how strong I am.'

Antorino died due to complications from pneumonia and a gastrointestinal problem, the latter of which seemed to begin in April.

'She was really fine before that, no major issues,' Sarah Antorino told the Herald. 'Lexi had never been in the hospital since we took her home after the accident.'

'She had e. coli in her blood and urine,' she added in reference to a hospital visit last week. 'We don't know why. She was crying at the hospital. The only way I really knew Lexi was crying was a nostril flair or one tear, but both of her eyes were crying. She was in agony.'

Caretaker Joan Lewis also recalled happy memories with Antorino.

'Up until the end, when she was in pain, I think she was happy,' she told the Herald. I danced for her. We watched princess movies and read stories.'

Family friend Delilah Toledo, 13, and her mother Naya Toledo were photographed mourning Antorino's death at the family's home.

Sarah Antorino told the Herald she will release butterflies as part of her daughter's memorial service on Saturday in Ellenton.

'I'm setting free some butterflies because my butterfly got stuck in her cocoon,' she said.
