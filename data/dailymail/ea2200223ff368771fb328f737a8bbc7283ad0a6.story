Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers thinks top players from around Europe are keen to join the Anfield revolution because of the thrilling way they have qualified for the Champions League.

Rodgers will be given £60million to spend by the club owners and has been linked with a number of targets, including Ukraine winger Yevhen Konoplyanka, Argentina’s World Cup left-back Marcos Rojo and emerging England talents Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana and Steven Caulker.

Last year, Rodgers was devastated to miss out on £25m playmaker Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who chose Borussia Dortmund over Merseyside.

But Rodgers, who takes his side to Crystal Palace tomorrow night aiming to bounce back after losing at home to Chelsea last weekend, is more hopeful of landing players this time, with 96 goals in the Premier League and getting the best out of Luis Suarez.

‘We had the experience last summer when players respected what we were developing at the club but wanted to play at the top level [the Champions League],’ said Rodgers. ‘I suspect this summer will be a totally different proposition.

‘Our style of football is recognised. We have a way of working and a way of playing that in particular top players want to play in, a creative attacking team that wins. Hopefully it prepares us for bringing in this calibre of player and sets us up to have a real crack at the competition.’

Rodgers wants to sign at least new five players to help cope with the Premier League and Champions League. Selling goalkeeper Pepe Reina for £5million after his loan spell at Napoli ends would provide additional funds.

‘It’s absolutely right to say that the squad isn’t big enough. It needs to be improved. The owners recognise that as well. They have been great.

'They have a strategic way of looking at it and my job is to manage that,’ said Rodgers. ‘They have entrusted me to put my football vision  in place.’

Rodgers criticised Jose Mourinho’s tactics after Chelsea’s 2-0 victory at Anfield last Sunday, saying they had parked two buses to win. He has since called Mourinho, his former mentor, to smooth over any problems, but insists he does not regret his comments.

‘It was a professional look  at the game,’ Rodgers said.  ‘I don’t regret saying it was tough for us to break through, which it was.’
