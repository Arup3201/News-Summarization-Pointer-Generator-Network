One of the people injured in the Santa Monica shooting rampage on Friday spoke from her hospital bed to reporters.

Debra Fine told the media that she saw the shooter, John Zawahri, 23, wearing a Kevlar vest and carrying a rifle, which he pointed at the woman in the car in front of her.

Fine tried to intervene and was shot four times by Zawahri, after which she crashed her vehicle and pretended to be dead to escape his wrath.

After Fine was shot she lay as 'still as she could,' she told Fox News from her hospital bed, a routine which she believes saved her life.

'My biggest fear was that he was going to come out and he was going to finish,' Fine told the news outlet. 'And I said ‘I can’t die, I have twins.'

When Fine initially saw the shooter he was motioning for the female driver in front of her to pull over.

'I first thought it was because he was trying to take traffic in a different direction because President Obama was in town,' Fine said.

'And then I saw that he actually had the rifle pulled up and pointed at her. So that’s when I realized it was quite a bit more than that.'

Trying to help the woman, Fine quickly maneuvered her own vehicle between Zawarhi and the woman shouting 'Don't!'

Zawahri immediately shifted his gaze to Fine which she described as 'clear and ferocious' and 'incredibly frightening.'

John Zawahri (pictured in his high school yearbook photo) was identified as the shooter in the Santa Monica campus killings. Zawahri killed four people, including his father and brother, and injured many more

'The next thing I knew, glass was shattering on the passenger side,' Fine said.

Zawahri's bullet only grazed her shoulder, but caused Fine to crash the car.

'I feel so grateful I’m alive,' Fine said. 'If I hadn’t ducked, and just laid down there, I don’t think I probably would have made it.'

Fine's injuries were just the beginning of Zawarhi's rampage. After injuring her he set fire to his father's Santa Monica home.

He then continued on hijack a car and carry out a killing spree that ended at Santa Monica College, taking the lives of four people including his father and brother.

Zawarhi himself was killed by Santa Monica Police. He is believed to have been gone on the shooting spree because of mental anguish over his parents divorce.

One of Zawarhi's other victims was 68-year old Carlos Navarro Franco, who died after his shots were fired into a car he was driving on the Santa Monica campus.

Franco's daughter Marcela, 26, who was also in the car, died from gun shot wound later at the hospital.

Fine, who was taken to the hospital immediately after the shooting, will recover from her wounds and was released from medical care yesterday.
