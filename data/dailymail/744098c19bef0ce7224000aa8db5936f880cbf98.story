After watching the winger seal Real Madrid's first trophy since 2012, Carlo Ancelotti said the club are lucky to have Gareth Bale.

Real beat fierce rivals Barcelona 2-1 in the Copa del Rey at the Mestalla, with the Welshman scoring the winning goal late on.

And the Italian boss has hailed the 'extraordinary' Bale, who shone in Cristiano Ronaldo's absence for Los Blancos.

The former Tottenham star surged down the left-wing before nutmegging Jose Pinto in the Barcelona goal with five minutes remaining.

'I had the perfect view of, it was a fantastic goal from an extraordinary player,' Ancelotti said after lifting the trophy.

'We are lucky he plays for Real Madrid.'

After struggling with fitness and form early on in his career at the Bernabeu, some doubted Bale's £86million price tag, but with 20 goals now this season he is making up for it.

Ancelotti called the goal 'surely the most important' of Bale's career, adding: 'It was a decisive moment. When (Marc) Bartra scored anything could have happened.

'He played well, the entire team played well. You have to play as a compact unit to beat Barcelona.'

Ronaldo was even there to congratulate his fellow winger, and Iker Casillas lifted the trophy at Valencia's stadium.

Meanwhile, it was Barcelona's third defeat on the bounce, a feat they haven't 'achieved' since 2003.

Angel di Maria netted an early opener for Madrid before Marc Bartra looked to have sent the game into extra time with a well placed header.

'I think the team played a fabulous match tonight in a very entertaining game,' Real captain Iker Casillas told Spanish television broadcaster TVE.

'We are happy for all the fans who came here to Valencia tonight,' added the Spain keeper, who was beaten only once, by Bartra's goal, in nine matches in this season's Cup.

'Now we have to enjoy this moment and think about the league and the Champions League.'

Bartra, who was praised after the game
 by Gerardo Martino for his commanding performance at the back, was less
 than complimentary.

'They had two chances and scored two goals,' he said.

On the goal Martino said: 'It is difficult to see a player be able to sprint like that at that stage of the game.

'The game was going our way after we had leveled until that counterattack.'

He
 has now overseen Barcelona's worst season in years, but Martino still 
believes that he won't get the sack with another term left on his deal. 
'Obviously this is not a good moment,' Martino continued. 'It has been a
 hard week on all fronts.

'As
 I have said for one, two, three months now, I don't feel that my future
 has changed because of all that we lost, and nor do I think it would be
 different if we had won.'
