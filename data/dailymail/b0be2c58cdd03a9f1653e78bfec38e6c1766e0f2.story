It was designed to be flexible and unite Android devices, but Google’s latest operating system, called Lollipop, is said to be crashing phones and tablets.

People who rushed to download Android 5.0 have warned others not to upgrade, after reporting their devices have slowed down, and that some apps have broken or disappeared altogether thanks to the ‘unusable’ update.

Google’s new look Android operating system was launched last month to favourable reviews and is designed be used on different devices, even powering smartwatches, TVs and a car.

People who rushed to download Android 5.0 Lollipop (illustrated) have warned others not to upgrade, after reporting their devices have slowed down, repeatedly crash and that some apps have broken or disappeared altogether thanks to the ‘unusable’ update 

But, since its release, owners of Android devices have taken to forums to complain that it has crippled older tablets and smartphones.

The update glitch is affecting people who own Google’s range of Nexus products, including the new Nexus 6 phablet and Nexus 9 tablet, which were unveiled last month alongside Lollipop.

Many have reported problems with Wi-Fi connectivity and sound quality, while it’s emerged that apps created with the Adobe Air tool have been removed from some Nexus devices and owners can’t reinstall them.

One user told ZDNet that they regret downloading Lollipop, saying that their Nexus 7 tablet is ‘laggy’ and crashes frequently, while others claimed it has ‘ruined’ their tablet and made devices ‘unusable’.

People have taken to Adobe’s forum to complain that installing apps built with its Air tool show an error message that reads ‘-505’.

Adobe programme manager Chris Campbell wrote that the problem has been passed to Google, suggesting the blame lies with the search giant.

He said that Adobe wasn’t aware of a ‘critical’ bug before November 18 and is ‘not working with Google on a fix’.

The company is, however, investigating problems in-house. 

‘We're going to expand our testing and engineering will be canvassing the forum posts and bug reports for additional clues,’ Mr Campbell said.

Lollipop was promised to be a redefining update by Google.

The firm's latest Android operating system is designed to be flexible and to be used on different devices. It can now power a watch, TV and even a car. 

The new Turbo Charger combines with more detailed battery settings, which Google says will lead to longer lasting devices. The battery saver feature extends the life of device by up to 90 minutes.

The support for 64-bit processing for the first time on Nexus devices is also an upgrade, with some of Google's native apps like Chrome and Gmail supporting this feature, essentially meaning they will run faster and smoother than before.

Songs, photos, apps and recent searches from one Android device are immediately accessible on another.

Content responds to people's touch and their voice.

The operating system is designed to be more intuitive and better at multi-tasking. For example, users will be able to read an email alongside seeing their inbox.

Users can adjust their settings so only notifications from certain people and apps can get through and they will appear on the lockscreen. 

Devices can be secured using a pin, password or pattern - or now they can be linked to a trusted device like a watch or smart lock. 

Lollipop is being built into Google's new devices and is available on existing Nexus 5,7 and 10 devices.

A Google spokesman told MailOnline: ‘We're aware of reports that some Android users are facing issues and are looking into what might be the cause.’

Before a fix is announced, it’s suggested that people who have downloaded Lollipop should check which apps are running in the background and close any they’re not using to maximise performance. 

‘If users have downloaded the Lollipop update, having been prompted to do so from their device, and it has rendered their device unusable, our customer services team is standing by to help, and we recommend they contact them on 0800 328 6081,’ Google’s spokesman said.

There is also information on a number of forums that suggest people can revert back to Android 4.4 KitKat.
