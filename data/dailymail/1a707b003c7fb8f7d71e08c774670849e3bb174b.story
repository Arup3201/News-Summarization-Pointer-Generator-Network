A powerful new ad campaign has launched to warn people about the dangers of indoor tanning beds by confronting them with their own mortality.

New York-based agency Area 23 created the YouTube video ad for melanoma awareness organization Mollie's Fund, and set up a fake pop-up tanning salon in Manhattan to lure in passers-by, offering them a free solarium session.

The participants are handed goggles and towels, but are shocked when they are led not into a tanning booth, but the scene of their own 'funeral', complete with a coffin, solemn music and assembled mourners.

According to Mollie's Fund, 10,000 Americans die of melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer - every year, and indoor tanning is a 'major' cause.

For the unsuspecting participants in the video, this is of clearly no concern, and they gladly accept the free offer.

'This is so cute!' exclaims one giddy customer. 

Participants are subsequently photographed for a 'before and after' series, then handed a towel and some safety goggles.

As they push the curtain aside expecting to enter a tanning booth, they are confronted with a makeshift chapel lined with benches of downcast black-clad mourners.

'Are you f***ing kidding me?' asks one bewildered participant.

At the end of the room sits a tanning bed assembled to look like a coffin with a sign propped on its lid.

'In loving memory', it reads, alongside the earlier-snapped photo of the duped customer. 'You are gone but not forgotten.'

When asked how the scene made them feel, one respondent states, 'I feel terrible', while another admits, 'I'm in shock'.

'This is my first time tanning,' claims a young girl. 'After this, never again.'

The ad closes with a chilling statistic: 'Just one indoor tanning session increases your risk of melanoma by 20per cent.'

Mollie's Fund was founded after sophomore college student Mollie Biggane, who died shortly after discovering a cancerous mole on her thigh at the age of 20.

According to the foundation, more than one million new cases of skin cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. this year.
