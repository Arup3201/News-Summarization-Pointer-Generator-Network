It is being touted as the 'ultimate status symbol', and is so exclusive that only 100 mega-rich customers will be able to get their hands on one.

Visa has teamed up with Russian bank Sberbank to launch a solid gold credit card studded with 26 diamonds, equal to 0.17 carats.

The lavish card, which is currently only available to the top 100 most elite Visa Infinite customers in Kazakhstan, costs $100,000 for the first year.

Made entirely of the precious metal, the card does not have a magnetic strip, but it can be used for chip-based transactions.

Customers in Kazakhstan must fork out a whopping $100,000 for the privilege of tucking one of the solid gold credit cards into their designer wallets - $65,000 for the card itself with the balance of $35,000 remaining as credit to spend. The annual fee is $2,000.

The banks are hoping to capitalise on a 'growing appetite for elite, status-symbol cards', according to a Fox Business report.

Mega-rich Visa Infinite customers - thought to number about 400,000 in the Asia Pacific region - benefit from perks including a 24/7 concierge service, 'fast-track' treatment at hundreds of airports across the globe and instant access to a personal manager.

'Coveted piece of luxury': Visa the solid gold credit card will become the 'ultimate status symbol' for its ultra wealthy cardholders

The top 100 Visa Infinite cardholders in Kazakhstan will be able to purchase the new gold credit card.

'Ultra wealthy cardholders want differentiation and with this coveted piece of luxury, the card becomes the ultimate status symbol,' James Lim, head of consumer products for Visa in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East, said in a statement.

While the exclusive solid gold credit card is currently out of reach for even the likes of music mogul Simon Cowell, Arcadia boss Sir Philip Green and other wealthy western tycoons famous for splashing the cash, Visa is hoping to extend the card to customers in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East in the future.

However, no plans have yet been announced to introduce the card in the U.S.
