Hissan Dar was jailed for three and a half years after stealing £110,000 from a couple with learning difficulties

A gambling-addicted bank cashier who stole £110,000 from the account of a couple with learning difficulties was jailed for three-and-a-half years today.

NatWest worker Hissan Dar, 26, persuaded Stephen and Frances West to give him their cash card after promising to protect them from fraud.

Dar then took money from the couple, who he had advised for years, when they received a £200,000 inheritance from Mr West's mother.

Dar, who had worked for the bank for ten years and earned a £26,000 salary, told them he was paying their bills, managing their cash and paying into a funeral plan for them.

Instead he spent £36,000 on roulette machines and bets on horse racing at a Ladbrokes store yards from the branch he was working at in Richmond, southwest London.

Dar also made cash withdrawals totalling £68,000 and £3,000 of credit card purchases, as well as applying for thousands of pounds of loans.

He was finally caught when other cashiers noticed suspicious activity on the West's account.

When he was arrested, he tried to claim the Wests had blown the money themselves on an extravagant lifestyle.

He later admitted fraud and was jailed at the Old Bailey for what Judge Timothy Pontius described as a 'deliberate and mean-minded' scam.

Judge Pontius said: 'You deliberately 
targeted the account and therefore the very modest income of a 
thoroughly decent couple who had reposed a high degree of trust in your 
handling of their financial affairs.

'They
relied on your professional acumen and advice to a significant degree 
given their learning difficulties and obvious lack of familiarity with 
the complexities of managing an account in a time of fiscal constraint 
and uncertainty.'

The Wests have been refunded by NatWest and the judge said the bank should be commended for this.

But he added: 'That financial loss is
perhaps less significant to them than the undoubtedly shocking effect 
upon them of learning that the man in whom they had so completely placed
their trust over a period of years had disgracefully abused that trust 
to such an extent.'

The 
court heard Mrs West, in her 50s, had learning difficulties and poor 
eyesight, while Mr West, in his 60s, also had 'below average' 
intelligence.

Both worked part-time in a poppy factory.

Prosecutor Juliet Oliver said: 'They are physically quite frail as well.

'But Mr and Mrs West have always endeavoured to live as an independent couple as best they can, although they do receive support in the community.

'Their main aim is to try and avoid being thought of as stupid.

'They believed bank employees were not only trustworthy but able to assist them in organising their financial affairs.'

Their trust was shattered on June 29 last year when they went to NatWest to withdraw money.

'They explained they needed more than the £200 cash Mr Dar had allowed them to cover the period he was away on holiday,' said Ms Oliver.

'They didn't have their cash card as Mr Dar held them, he said to protect them from fraud.

'Staff did a check and saw £300 had been withdrawn earlier that day through an ATM.

'There was a pattern of recent withdrawals in sums of hundreds of pounds.

Dar worked as cashier at the NatWest branch in Richmond. The bank has refunded the money to the couple

'When asked, the Wests said it was probably Hissan. They refused to believe anything could be amiss with their accounts.

'Such was their trust that they actually telephoned him that evening.'

Further investigation showed huge amounts of money had gone missing since March 2011, with a large chunk spent on gambling.

Mr West said he had only ever bet £5 on a horse race and £4 on the Eurovision song contest.

When he was arrested, Dar claimed the Wests had spent the money themselves, telling police they ate out at restaurants three times a day.

He later owned up, but claimed he had been trying to support his family after his father was laid off.

Madeleine Wolfe, defending, said: 'He is perhaps not a callous or devious man but a man who lost control of his finances and turned in desperation to criminal activity.

'He is thoroughly ashamed of himself, as he ought to be.'
