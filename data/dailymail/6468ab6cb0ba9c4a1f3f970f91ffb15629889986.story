A Georgia police officer has received a kidney transplant from a stranger after a family photo asking for a donor went viral.

Raleigh Callaway, 49, who works for the Greensboro Police Department, was diagnosed with Stage 5 kidney failure earlier this year.

In a last-ditch attempt to find a donor, he, his wife Kristi and their two daughters posed for a photo holding a sign reading: 'Our daddy needs a kidney!'.

Emotional plea: In a last-ditch attempt to find a donor, Mr Callaway, his wife Kristi and their two daughters posed for a photo holding a sign reading: 'Our daddy needs a kidney!' (pictured) around two months ago

They then posted the picture on Facebook and it quickly went viral, attracting the attention of thousands of people, including Chris Carroll, who lives hundreds of miles away in Texas.

Now, Mr Callaway is recovering at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta after Mr Carroll underwent a procedure to remove his kidney and transplant it into the officer yesterday. 

Speaking just minutes before his surgery, Mr Callaway expressed his gratitude to his 'superhero', saying: 'It's just so important for me to continue to live, and to take care of my family.'

And today, Mrs Callaway said doctors were 'thrilled with how surgery went' and the kidney was functioning 'great' in her husband's body, reported 11alive.com.

Mr Carroll, from McKinney, was 'immediately moved' to donate his kidney after reading about long-time police officer's plight online in July. 

His wife Veronica told ABC: 'He saw Raleigh’s picture and read the story and called me and said "I feel God is telling me to do this".'

Mr Carroll then undertook a test kit from Emory and was found to be a perfect match, before informing Mr Callaway of his decision to donate his kidney.

In celebration, Mr Callaway and his family posted a new series of pictures, with each family member holding a sign reading: 'We found a kidney for daddy!' 

Daughters: Mr Callaway's daughters are pictured holding signs reading: 'I'm thankful Daddy will have a new kidney so he won't be sick anymore' and 'I am thankful that my Daddy will be able to watch me grow up!' 

Charitable: Mrs Callaway (pictured) and Brandy Angel - the photographer who took the family picture - have set up a non-profit organisation, Callaways Angels, to help other people who are in need of a kidney transplant

As Mr Callaway's health declined, Mr Carroll then pushed to speed up the process of the surgery, undergoing the transplant less than 10 weeks after he first saw the family photo.

Mrs Carroll said the two families 'instantly bonded' when they met at hospital earlier this month

'They’re saying "We don’t know how to thank you,' she said. 'We already feel like we’ve got blessings form this. This is not a one way situation. We feel very blessed to be a part of it.' 

She added that her husband, who is  recovering just a few doors away from Mr Callaway in hospital, had even managed to walk a few steps to visit the police officer. 

'Family': As Mr Callaway's (left) health declined, Mr Carroll (right) pushed to speed up the process of the surgery. He ended up undergoing the kidney transplant less than 10 weeks after he saw the family photo

'There was tears and happiness, it was a wonderful reunion,' she said. 

Speaking before the surgery, Mr Carroll said that giving his kidney to Mr Callaway felt like donating it to family, saying: 'We're supposed to love one another. We're supposed to sacrifice for one another.'

Mrs Callaway and Brandy Angel - the photographer who took the family picture - have now set up a non-profit organisation, Callaways Angels, to help other people in need of a kidney transplant.
