Roy Keane said Manchester United's players 'should be ashamed of themselves' after manager David Moyes was sacked.

The former United captain, speaking on ITV ahead of Chelsea's Champions League semi-final at Atletico Madrid, said he didn't think Moyes had the support of the dressing room - but he should have been given more time.

'He (Moyes) had a hard start,' Keane said. 'Last summer, when he took the job, the chief executive didn't get the deals done and they had a slow start.'

I'm done: David Moyes was relieved of his duties as Manchester United manager on Tuesday

Keane added: 'I think it's a shame - 
he should have been given more time. Some of the players should be 
ashamed of themselves because they really let him down.'

Moyes
 was referred to as 'The Chosen One' having been picked for the role by 
Sir Alex Ferguson when his long reign came to an end last season.

But Keane said: 'You can't be critical of Sir Alex Ferguson. It wasn't necessarily his pick, he put his name forward but the club made the decision.

'To
 be seventh in the league is disappointing and you still have to take 
responsibility for that but he didn't have the support of the players.'Â 

End of the line: Moyes lasted just 10 months of his six-year contract having been appointed last summer

Abject: Keane hasn't held back in his criticism of the club he used to captain this season

Leader: Keane won seven Premier League crowns with United during his 12-year stay

Keane won seven Premier League titles and the Champions League during his 12-year playing spell at Old Trafford.

Jose Mourinho later told ITV he felt 'sorry' for Moyes after his dismissal.

The Chelsea manager, who was linked with the United managerial role last year, said: 'I prefer not to comment. I feel sorry for him, obviously, but I make no comments.

'I just feel sorry for David like I feel sorry for every manager who loses his jobs.'
