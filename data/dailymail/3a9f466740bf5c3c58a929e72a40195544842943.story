An 11-year-old suspected rape victim decided not to go to police because of a storyline in EastEnders in which the victim was not supported, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.

The girl, who was worried about going through a court case, only summoned up the courage to make a complaint years later, it is claimed.

She claims Junior Hall, 41, raped her after she called him 'gay'.

Concerned: An eleven-year-old girl did not report her rape to police because EastEnders storyline made her worried about court case

Hall is said to have sexually assaulted her and then responded: 'I'm not gay, I like this too much'.

He then tried to bribe her with a £20 note, it is alleged.

The alleged victim tried to tell her mother but felt she was not believed.

Prosecutor Mark Gadsden said: 'At the time she felt the matter should be reported to police.

'She said she was influenced by a storyline in the programme Eastenders and didn't want to go through a court case as she didn't get any support.'

She reported the rape in 2010 and claimed the attack took place between June 2001 and June 2003 when she was aged eleven or twelve.

Trail: Junior Hall, 41 from Battersea, south London denies a singe count of rape and the trial continues at the Old Bailey

Mr Gadsen said: 'They were playfighting together. She accused him of essentially being gay because he was not fighting hard enough and she was winning.

'His response to that was to grab hold of her and put his hands down her tracksuit bottoms.'

He then raped her even though she was too young to consent to sex by law, it is claimed.

'It was very painful for her and when it was over she went off and had a bath,' said Mr Gadsden.

'He then came up and offered her a £20 note, an attempt to bribe her, saying can she go to the shops and she could keep the change.'

Mr Hall from Battersea, south London denies a singe count of rape. 

The trial continues.
