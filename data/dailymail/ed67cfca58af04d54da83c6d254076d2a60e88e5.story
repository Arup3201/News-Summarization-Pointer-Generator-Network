Tragic: Hannah Bleasdale died in her sleep after 'suffering a seizure' caused by an undiagnosed medical condition

A dental nurse died in her sleep after 'suffering a seizure' caused by an undiagnosed condition triggered by a blood clot she was believed to have successfully recovered from.

Hannah Bleasdale, 19, described as a 'precious daughter', was 
discovered wrapped up in her duvet at her family home in Leyland, Lancashire, an inquest heard.

Her mother had come into the bedroom to try to wake her for a second time - before realising her daughter had passed away.

The teenager, who loved horse riding, had suffered from a blood clot on the brain in 2009 which was believed to have been successfully treated, Preston Coroner's Court heard today.

It caused her severe headaches and pain - but doctors now fear it may have had fatal repercussions.

Miss Bleasdale, who missed two months of school after the clot was discovered, died just weeks before she had been due to jet off to the Dominican Republic to fulfil her dream of swimming with dolphins.

She had gone to bed early on the night of May 27 after hugging her younger brother and sending texts to her boyfriend and cousin. 

Her mother Elaine, 57, tried to wake
her at 10am the following morning - but
thinking her daughter was still asleep, she left the room.

She returned at 12.30pm to 
rouse her - only to discover her teenage child had died.

Professor Tim Dawson, a consultant neuropathologist, said: '(Hannah) wouldn’t have known anything about it.

'She had taken a drink of coffee to her bedroom. She had texted her cousin and her boyfriend. Her mother found her lying on her front with her body covered by the duvet.'

Professor Dawson said the post-mortem examination showed no abnormalities on Miss Bleasdale's brain or heart which could have contributed to her death, but concluded her death was most likely to have been caused by a seizure.

'We are all allowed one seizure,' he said. 'That doesn’t make us epileptic. You have to look at the probabilities.

'In this case, I would suggest that evidence points to some sort of seizure after what happened in the past. That affected the blood vessels and allowed fluid to flow into the lungs.'

Devastating: Miss Bleasdale, who missed two months of school after the clot was discovered, died just weeks before she had been due to jet off to the Dominican Republic to fulfil her dream of swimming with dolphins

Dr Wendy Grice, Miss Bleasdale’s GP from birth, told the inquest she had seen Hannah on a number of occasions, but nothing had emerged to make her believe Hannah was seriously unwell. 

'There was no history of Hannah having seizures but she did have a significant clot on the brain in 2009,' she said.

'It led to her having severe headaches. She was entered for a scan and that revealed the clot. At her next MRI scan, the clot had gone. Drugs were given which allowed the clot to resolve.'

Despite missing two months of school after the clot was discovered, Miss Bleasdale still managed to achieve six As and four Bs in her GCSEs. 

Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, coroner Simon Jones said: 'Professor Dawson couldn’t find anything structural that could confirm the cause of death. 

'His conclusion is that on the balance of probabilities she had some form of seizure-related death. I see no reason to dispute those findings. 

'There was nothing untoward about this death - but given we’re talking about the death of a 19-year-old, that’s perhaps not the right word. 

'I realise there is nothing I can say that offers any comfort but I do offer my condolences. I am very sorry that you had to come here.'

After the inquest, Hannah’s devastated mother Elaine, who attended the hearing with husband Phil, 51, and Hannah’s grandparents, paid tribute to her daughter - saying she had loved her job and had enjoyed going out with her many friends at weekends.

'She was such a precious daughter. She was loved by all her family as you can see. It was a natural death and I’m glad she died peacefully,' said Elaine.

'We’re pleased that if you have to go then she did it peacefully. We will miss her so much.'

At the time of Hannah’s death, Elaine told how the teenager had started to organise her clothes for a holiday, before hugging her younger brother and going to bed early.

'I gave her a hug and a kiss in the kitchen and she said she loved us,' she said.

'The following morning I just thought she was having a lie in. I went up to ask if she wanted anything for breakfast or lunch. I went up and that was it. It was a complete shock.'

Professor Dawson has asked for Miss Bleasdale's immediate family to be screened to prevent any future tragedies.
