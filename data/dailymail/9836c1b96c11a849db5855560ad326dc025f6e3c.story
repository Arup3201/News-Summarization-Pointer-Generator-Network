More than 40 police officers were tonight involved in a ‘substantial’ hunt for a 17-year-old girl who has been missing for 10 days.

Jayden Parkinson has not used her mobile phone, bank card or updated her Facebook page since the start of the month - and detectives said ‘alarm bells were ringing’ over the disappearance.

The teenager from Didcot, Oxfordshire - who was described as 5ft 5in with shoulder-length brown hair and has never gone missing before - has not been seen since Tuesday of last week.

Concerns: Jayden Parkinson has not used her mobile phone, bank card or updated her Facebook page since the start of the month - and detectives said 'alarm bells were ringing' over the disappearance

Thames Valley Police detectives hunting Jayden appealed directly for her to get in touch with her parents, amid growing concerns for her safety.

Police officers have so far failed to find the teenager, despite scouring footage from hundreds of CCTV cameras and conducting helicopter searches.

Superintendent Christian Bunt, who is leading the inquiry, has called for Jayden to make contact, saying she could be in her hometown but also had links to Oxford and Reading, Berkshire.

He added at a press conference: ‘The concerning thing for us is we don’t believe she’s has got access to any finances, a telephone or fresh clothes. She has not left with a bag or anything.

‘She’s not made contact with anyone at all as far as we are aware. We’ve had no contact from her whatsoever, which is highly unusual.

‘If you think of all the normal footprints you would leave in your life - card transactions, phone calls or internet use - she’s not making those footprints, which is a real concern for us.’

He said a ‘substantial police operation’ was in full swing, adding: ‘There has been a large amount of inquiries which we have made in the last week and unfortunately at the moment, most of them are coming back negative, or at least not leading us to Jayden’s whereabouts.’

Jayden had moved out of her family home in Didcot ‘a matter of weeks’ before she vanished from a youth hostel in Oxford called 1 Foot Forward, around mid-afternoon.

However, Supt Bunt said there had been ‘no bust up’ with her family or friends to trigger her out-of-character disappearance.

Jayden left the hostel wearing light blue faded jeans, a brown hooded jumper and high-top trainers and said she was ‘going out’ before vanishing.

Supt Bunt said the unemployed teenager had left her mother, father and sister ‘very worried’.

‘Her mother is, as you would expect any mother to be,’ he told reporters. ‘She is very upset and very concerned. The whole family is completely engaging with us.’

He added: ‘There’s been no contact on Facebook or social media. There’s nothing at all. There’s no contact which is highly unusual not just for a young person but anybody these days.

‘She has previously used social media and kept in contact with people and now she is not so something has changed. That rings alarm bells for us.’

In a direct appeal to the missing teenage girl, Supt Bunt said: ‘Jayden, you are not in trouble at all. We just want to hear from you. We are concerned for your safety and well-being.

‘Please make contact with us on our 101 number or come into a police station. We don’t mind how you get in contact, we just want the contact because we are growing concerned for you.’

Supt Bunt admitted a previous missing persons appeal elicited just ‘one or two’ phone calls to police and urged the public to keep an eye out for Jayden.

‘She is a 17 year old girl without the appropriate resources to take care of herself. We are hoping she is with someone who is looking after her and she just wanted to get away for a bit.

‘But we need to know this for sure, we need to hear from her. If anyone sees Jayden or knows where she is then please get in touch with the police, because we are really concerned for her.’
