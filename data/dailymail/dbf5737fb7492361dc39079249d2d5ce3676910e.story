A commuter heading into Boston in a car-pooling lane has been cited after a trooper spotted a mustachioed mannequin in the passenger seat.

State Trooper John Carnell was working a paid detail in Quincy, Massachusetts, this morning when he saw a vehicle enter the carpool lane on Interstate 93 north with a suspicious-looking passenger.

Carnell pulled over the vehicle and found that indeed, the driver was attempting to pass off a dummy as a human in a bid to get through traffic faster.

The mannequin head was propped up a jacket in the passenger seat of the car.

The fake head even had a little mustache drawn on.

Vehicles using the lane must have at least two occupants.

The driver, whose name was not made public, has been issued a citation for operating on an excluded way.

The duo were spotted at approximately 6:35 a.m. by Carnell, who immediately knew the dummy was a 'counterfeit passenger.'

When he pulled the car over, Carnell found the driver 'had propped up a work jacket with a mannequin head affixed to the top of the jacket in an attempt to create the illusion of a true passenger.'

'The purpose of the HOV (high occupancy vehicle) lane is to alleviate the number of cars on the roadway during the morning and evening commute times. This is accomplished by encouraging carpooling,' state police said.

According to Boston Globe, Carnell is something of an expert when it comes to detecting fake humans in car-pooling lanes.

In April 2013, he stopped a vehicle because 'a woman had placed a full size doll in a car seat' in an attempt to out smart the system.
