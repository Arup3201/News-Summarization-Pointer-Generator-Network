Partying in rowdy bars, downing shots and pints of beer and gleefully clutching a bottle of pink champagne... these are the holiday snaps of White Dee, one of the stars of controversial TV show Benefits Street.

Dee, whose real name is Deirdre Kelly, claims to be too depressed to go to work and lives off benefits as a result. Yet here she is living the life of a party girl on an all-expenses-paid, mid-week trip to Magaluf in Majorca.

And she clearly had plenty of fun - having been pictured passionately kissing a man before leading him away, hand in hand.

She may be too depressed to work, but that didnt stop White Dee partying hard on holiday in Magaluf

The Benefits Street star was spotted enjoying an all-expenses-paid, mid-week trip to Majorca

The mother of two was invited on the four-day holiday by another of her agent’s clients, an American singer.

She
 was seen drinking a £500 bottle of Moet and lounging around at a 
private pool party before going on a bar crawl, where she downed copious
 amounts of alcohol.

Despite appearing to enjoy the trip, Dee said: ‘I’m not having a nice time. I miss my kids and I hate flying.’

The
 42-year-old flew out to the resort, popular with 18-30s package 
holidays, on Wednesday – while most people were hard at work.

Wearing a Carnage T-shirt later in the night, Dee was pictured downing a pint and five shots as part of a drinking competition

Dee, who is on £10,000-a-year in sickness benefits in Birmingham, spent the first night of the holiday at an event organised by Carnage Magaluf

She
 headed home yesterday to James Turner Street in Winson Green, 
Birmingham, the deprived road where the Channel 4 show was set.

Under the current benefits regime, Dee is allowed to undertake work and keep claiming disability living allowance.

It is not against the rules to go on holiday if you are in receipt of benefits.

But
 claimants must inform the Department for Work and Pensions immediately 
if their condition changes, and proof that Dee is not in fact depressed 
could lead to an investigation into her payments.

The DWP said that it would not discuss individual circumstances.

Those
 claiming Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) can still claim 
benefits for four weeks if you go abroad, but claimers must speak to 
their local Jobcentre before they leave.

Dee,
 who is said to be on £10,000-a-year in benefits, spent the first night 
of the holiday ‘making an appearance’ at a party, with drinkers paying 
£25 a ticket for the privilege of her company.

She did not receive a fee for attending.

Alan
 Collinson, of events firm Carnage Magaluf which organised the party, 
said he did not know Dee was suffering from depression which stops her 
from working for a living.

He
 said: ‘She came across as a good laugh. She’s off out tonight with us 
on a bar crawl. I don’t think she is a big drinker though – she told me 
she prefers tea and biscuits.’

He added that the £500 bottle of champagne was given to her for free.

Dee
 was also seen enjoying cocktails and laughing with guests at a Benefits
 Street-themed pool party at the TRH hotel in the resort.

Later in the night, she was pictured downing a pint and five shots in a drinking competition.

The
 trip was organised by Dee’s agent, Barry Tomes, who said the holiday 
was a pick-me-up to help combat her depression, which has prevented her 
from working for many years.

He told the Daily Mail: ‘We’re trying to give her a bit of light-hearted fun. We’ve told her that if she can conquer depression we can make you a living and you won’t be on benefits any more.’ 

Although she looked like she was having a great time, she said of the trip: 'I'm not having a nice time. I miss my kids and I hate flying'

Dee became the face of Benefits Street, a television series which pulled in more than five million viewers and attracted more than a thousand complaints

Mr Collinson said the £500 bottle of champagne she had been drinking was given to her for free

He said it was the first time Dee had spent more than a night away from her daughter, Caitlin, 16, and son Gerrard, seven.

Mr
 Tomes added: ‘Who said depressed people shouldn’t be enjoying 
themselves? There’s nothing wrong with a person with depression getting 
some sunshine.

‘I don’t 
know how she can be accused of ripping off the state when she still 
takes daily medication and still sees her doctor for depression.’

Onlooker
 Amy Balfour, 21, of Sevenoaks, Kent, said: ‘People pay taxes and save 
for holidays. She hasn’t done either.’ 

Dee became the face of Benefits 
Street, which pulled in more than five million viewers and attracted 
more than 1,000 complaints.

She
 revealed she receives benefits of £214 a week, but has since said she 
would stop claiming the money  if she started receiving an income, 
either because of the show or another job.

Although
 she worked as a barmaid, and was later a Birmingham City Council 
administrator, she left in disgrace after being convicted of stealing 
£13,000.

She narrowly avoided jail in 2007 and was ordered to carry out 220 hours of unpaid work.

Early episodes of the series included confessions from other residents that they had fraudulently claimed benefits.
