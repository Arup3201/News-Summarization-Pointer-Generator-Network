'Rape': Derek Chartres, 59, is alleged to have carried out the rape on the schoolgirl between 1982 and 1984

A senior Chamber of Commerce figure and former RAF police officer raped a schoolgirl while his wife lay on the bed watching, a court heard today.

Derek Chartres, 59, allegedly watched pornography and engaged in sex acts in front of schoolgirls and is also accused of raping a girl under 16.

The former Chamber of Commerce president is accused of a string of sex acts against two girls, while his wife Pearl, 51, denies aiding and abetting the rape after she allegedly lay on the bed and watched.

The alleged offences took place 
between 1982 and 1984 when Chartres, from Newport, Isle of Wight, 
committed the offences on the two schoolgirls, who are now both women in
their 40s, telling one it was 'sex education'.

One
of the women complained to police in 2010 that Mr Chartres raped her 
when she was a schoolgirl in the couple's bedroom, while his wife lay on
the bed and watched.

One
girl, who recalled being around 11 at the time, told police how Mr 
Chartres would watch pornographic videos in her presence and had once 
kissed her intimately.

She 
said Mr and Mrs Chartres asked if she liked sex and engaged in sex acts 
in front of her. They once had full sex in front of her calling it 'sex 
education', according to prosecutor Roderick Blain.

She said she also remembered Mr Chartres kissing her, which she found 'disgusting'.

In
a DVD interview conducted by police, played to jurors, the other alleged victim
said Mr Chartres watched pornographic videos and rubbed her leg.

On another occasion Mr and Mrs Chartres had full sex in front of her in the couple’s bedroom, she claimed.

She said: 'I could not believe what I was seeing.'

Under cross examination from Mr Chartres’s barrister, Robert Bryan, she agreed she could not be sure how old she was when the alleged offences took place.

Mr Bryan put it to the woman that she had 'made everything up'. However, she told the court everything she had said about the couple was the 'absolute truth'.

Mr Chartres, managing director of business logistics and support company The Business Services Group and a former officer in the Royal Air Force police, helped found a youth version of the Chamber of Commerce called Young Chamber.

He faces one charge of committing indecent assault, one of committing gross indecency with a child under the age of 14 and one of raping another girl under 16.

His wife, on trial alongside her husband this week, is accused of aiding and abetting a rape and indecent assault.

The couple are jointly charged with four counts of committing indecency with a child under the age of 14. They deny all charges.

The defence was due to start its case on Thursday.

The case at Portsmouth Crown Court continues.
