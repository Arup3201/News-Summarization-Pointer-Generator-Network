A robber who ripped a wedding ring from the finger of a 94-year-old widow who had not taken it off in 60 years has been jailed.

Slovakian Marion Pokuta, 22, attacked frail Doris Burnett, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, in her home in Bradford on January 16 while he had been released on bail for another theft.

Mrs Burnett died two months later.

She had been living in her home for 13 years supported by her family but was so distressed by the robbery she was moved to a nursing home and suffered a stroke on March 27.

Although she had dementia, the widow would tell the home's manager about a man who stole her wedding ring.

Prosecutor Philip Adams said: 'It left a profound effect on her in the final months of her life.'

Mrs Burnett married husband John at the age of 34 and the couple remained together for 30 years before he died.

Both worked in the mills in Bradford but the couple never had children.

After the case at Bradford Crown Court, Mrs Burnett's nephew Clifford Lupton described Pokuta as 'despicable'.

He said: 'The way he took it was terrible. That ring had not been off her finger for 60 years.'

Mr Lupton's wife, Diane, 65, added: 'She was tough but we had to put her in the home and she only lasted eight weeks.

'I think it did make her health deteriorate, she always wanted to stay in her own little house and she wanted a birthday card from the Queen and she would have got one if it hadn’t been for this idiot.'

Sentencing Pokuta for seven years, Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC, said: 'I wish I could order your deportation. 

'What you did was wicked and cowardly.'

In another attack, the court heard how Pokuta demanded a glass of water and was invited into the home of Laura Clarke, 92.

He pushed Mrs Clarke, who walks with a stick, to the ground before snatching her jewellery. 

Pokuta pleaded guilty to stealing two gold chains from her neck in her home in Bradford on November 4 last year. 

The court heard this was third time Pokuta had targeted the dementia sufferer in her home. 

In December 2010, he twice stole money from her and was given a four-month jail sentence. 

Speaking outside court, Mrs Clarke described how she suffered a heart attack two days after the attack and spent a week in hospital recovering. 

The great-grandmother said: 'I’m lucky compared to some of his other victims but it very nearly killed me - I must have had a guardian angel looking over me that day. 

'I’m getting over it a bit better now but I couldn’t sleep for a while. It still comes back into my head whenever there’s a knock on the door and I never answer it alone.'

Pokuta's solicitor advocate, Kam Dhesi, mitigating said his family was horrified and ashamed.

Detective Constable Sean Donoghue, of West Yorkshire Police, added: 'These were disgraceful and despicable acts against some of the most vulnerable members of our community. 

'Pokuta targeted his victims in the full knowledge that they would not be able to defend themselves and would succumb to superior force. 

'The fact that he physically pulled a wedding ring from the fingers of one of his victims is a clear indication of his conscienceless character.'
