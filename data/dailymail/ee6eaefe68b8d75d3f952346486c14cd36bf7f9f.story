The mother of 10-year-old Sarah Murnaghan, who is recovering from two double lung transplants says her daughter will soon move out of intensive care.

Janet Murnaghan, of Pennsylvania,  wrote on her Facebook page yesterday that her daughter Sarah is being moved to a progressive care unit at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

The Newtown Square girl received the transplants after a federal judge intervened in her parents' lawsuit challenging national transplant rules.

Sarah is making good progress in her recovery process after her double lung transplant in June

Sarah's first set of adult lungs failed after a transplant June 12. A second set was transplanted three days later.

Janet Murnaghan did not return a call today, and the family has not given the hospital permission to comment.

Her
parents launched a national campaign to help with her treatment and in 
June they released a video showing her amazing recovery.

In
the footage, the young Pennsylvania girl waves, smiles and looks alert -
a relief for the thousands of supporters from across the country who 
have followed her inspiring journey.

The
heartwarming video comes as her mother, Janet Murnaghan, revealed on 
Facebook that her daughter had undergone tests and learned that the 
transplant appears to have been successful.

'Sarah's first lung biopsy, taken during surgery, shows NO REJECTION!' Janet Murnaghan shared on Facebook in June.

It is fantastic news for the little girl, who nearly died after complications with a first set of donor lungs and needed a second transplant.

The parents of Sarah Murnaghan have revealed that their daughter nearly died after complications with a first set of donor lungs and has since had a second transplant

Sarah suffers from late-stage cystic 
fibrosis, and her parents' battle to be allowed an organ transplant 
provoked a national debate after she was initially denied one on the 
grounds that she was too young.

Eventually
they secured a court order to ensure she was placed in line for adult 
lungs because of the severity of her illness, rather than her age.

Sarah
suffered a ‘code blue’ emergency after the June 12 transplant of a 
first set of donor lungs at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia failed 
and she was placed on machines.

Within
three days, on June 15, a new set of lungs became available, her 
parents said. Those organs were infected with pneumonia, but the family 
agreed to take them because the organs represented Sarah’s last chance 
at life.

The child underwent a second surgery on June 21, after which she was awakened from a medically induced coma.

The family, who had been so public about Sarah's situation, acknowledged they withheld details of her status.

'It was only then that we could allow ourselves to feel real hope and being posting some information on Facebook about Sarah’s progress,' the family statement said.

'We’re
not out of the woods, but Sarah’s health is trending in the right 
direction and we wanted to provide more detailed information as to what 
she has been going through.'

Progress: Sarah's parents say she has now recovered enough to open her eyes and take her first breaths

After lung transplant surgery, most patients have their breathing tubes removed within 24 hours and out of intensive care within a week, but while some are released from hospital within weeks, others take months.

Doctors had only given Sarah a few weeks to live without new lungs. Since she was too young to be put on the adult donor list, she faced certain death since child donations are rare.

Sarah's plight sparked a national 
debate over organ transplant policies, which until now barred children 
younger than 12 from the adult waiting list.

The Murnaghans scored a
major victory on June 6 when a judge ordered the Organ Procurement and 
Transplantation Network to add the 10-year-old to the list for adult 
lungs.

On surgery day, Mrs Murnaghan said
that had it not been for the judge's recent ruling, they would not have
gotten this set of lungs, which likely came from an adult or teenager.

'Sarah would've been number 400 or something on the list,' she said.

The Organ Procurement and 
Transplantation Network added the 10-year-old to the list on Wednesday night after 
U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson's original ruling on June 5th..

The
ruling applied only to Sarah, who has end-stage cystic fibrosis and has
been awaiting a transplant at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

An expert has questioned the decision on medical and ethical grounds.

On June 12, Sarah's mother said that a set of lungs had become available for her daughter.

'God is great! He moved the mountain! 
Sarah got THE CALL,' a statement posted on her Facebook page read. 
'Please pray for Sarah's donor, her HERO, who has given her the 
gift of life.'

That afternoon, Sarah's mother spoke to a reporter from Fox 29
about her daughter's searching, describing the family as being nervous 
but  'excited' about the surgery because doctors had given her child 
about a week to live, and they were out of options.

Fears: Janet and Fran Murnaghan criticized the regulations that kept Sarah from getting an adult lung

'We're just so thankful for the donor,' Ruddock Murnaghan said,
adding that while it is a great day for her, it is not lost on her that
it is a tragic day for the donor's family, who had lost a loved one.

Lung
transplants are the most difficult of organ transplants, and children 
fare worse than adults, which is one reason for the existing policy, 
said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone 
Medical Center.

He called it troubling, and perhaps precedent-setting, for a judge to overrule that medical judgment, and predicted a run to the courthouse by patients who don't like their place on the waiting list.

'I'm not sure I want judges or congressmen or bureaucrats trying to decide what to do with organs at the bedside,' Caplan said.

The Murnaghans said pediatric lungs are rarely donated, so they believe older children should have equal access to adult donations.

Nationwide, about 1,700 people are on 
the waiting list for a lung transplant, including 31 children under age 
11, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.
