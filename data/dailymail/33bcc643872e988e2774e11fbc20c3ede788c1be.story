Bas Dost must have rung in the New Year in some style. The Wolfsburg striker has been a transformed player since 2014 ticked over into 2015 and just can't stop scoring.

Hardly prolific in the first-half of the season, with just one goal to his credit, the Dutchman is now Europe's hottest striker following a sensational run of form.

Dost's double in Wolfsburg's thrilling 5-3 comeback win over Werder Bremen on Sunday took his 2015 tally to 13 goals in eight outings.

His total is second only to Barcelona's Argentine star Lionel Messi, who has 15 goals in 14 matches since the beginning of January.

But arguably Dost's current form is more impressive, given that the Bundesliga only resumed on January 30 following its winter break.

Having scored against Cologne in Wolfsburg's last fixture before the winter pause, Dost picked up where he'd left off with two against league leaders Bayern Munich on January 30.

He then found the net in the home win over Hoffenheim on February 7, before scoring four in a remarkable 5-4 win at Bayer Leverkusen a week later.

The run has continued, with Dost scoring two goals in each of Wolfsburg's matches with Sporting Lisbon, Hertha Berlin and Werder Bremen in the last fortnight.

The 25-year-old's prolific form has pretty much sealed Wolfsburg a place in next season's Champions League - though they are eight points behind runaway leaders Bayern, they have a 10-point cushion from third-placed Borussia Monchengladbach. They are also through to a last 16 Europa League tie with Italian giants Inter Milan.

Dost's form has also stolen the thunder of Andre Schurrle, who arrived at the Volkswagen Arena from Chelsea on deadline day for a fee of £22m.

'Things keep going, and they're going well,' said Dost after his brace in Bremen. 'Every week I'm here saying that [the goals] will stop again, but I just keep going and we'll see where I am in the end.'

It hasn't always been so good for Dost. This is his third season in the Bundesliga and by some way his best - he scored 12 in 33 matches in his first season at Wolfsburg, then five in 15 last year.

The 6ft 5in target man has prospered from an effective link up with the former Chelsea man Kevin de Bruyne, who has contributed six assists since the Bundesliga resumed in January.

Born in the Dutch city of Deventer, Dost's first professional clubs were Emmen and Heracles Almelo, where 15 goals during the 2009-10 season led to rumours of a move to Ajax.

In the end, the 20-year-old moved elsewhere in the Eredivisie to Heerenveen and realised his potential with two prolific seasons.

In 2011-12, he scored a remarkable 38 goals in 39 matches in Dutch league and cup, finishing as the country's top goalscorer.

Inevitably, there was interest from the Premier League, with Dost turning down a £7m move to Aston Villa at the time.

Instead he moved to the Bundesliga and Wolfsburg, making an immediate impact with a stoppage time winner away to Stuttgart on his debut. Aside from that, his winner at defending champions Borussia Dortmund last season was also memorable.

But it is this season that has seen Dost elevate his game to another level. Having started the campaign as Wolfsburg's third-choice striker, he is now indispensible.

With his eye for goal, clinical finishing, aerial prowess and ability to hold the ball up, Dost has matured into the complete package, raising plenty of eyebrows throughout the football world.
