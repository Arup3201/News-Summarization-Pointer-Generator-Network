The odds of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge calling their second baby Alice have tumbled – after punters began to stake large amounts of money on the name.

Bookmaker William Hill slashed the odds of the new royal baby being given the name from 14-1 to 4-1 after a flurry of bets were made last week.

Rupert Adams, spokesman for the bookmaker, said: 'Alice is the new favourite and we have seen a significant number of bets. You have to think there is good reason for the gamble.'

Admit it: we're all slightly obsessed with the Duchess' style. And while the gorgeous Kate has just given birth to a baby girl, we can't wait to see what she steps out in when she leaves hospital.

This throwback photo of when she left St Mary's Hospital with George, shows just how in tune with her style she really is. Blue for a boy and a cute printed pick perfect for spring.

The dress was a bespoke pale blue polka dot dress from Jenny Packham so naturally you can't buy it, but head right to browse the website.

Whether it's designer evening wear or high street casual, the Duchess of Cambridge's skill for putting an outfit together and her ability to look nothing other than perfect has resulted in her outfits flying off the shelves in minutes as the world races to emulate the queen of style.

This dress is the perfect example of how Kate manages to use wardrobe choices to come across as down-to-earth whilst still being the glossy polished princess she is.

He added that they have seen a large volume of bets from Tunbridge, in Kent.

If the wagers prove correct, the bookmakers face losing a five-figure sum.

Since the mid 19th century a number of royal women have been called Alice, with Queen Victoria calling her second daughter Princess Alice and the wife of the late Duke of Gloucester - the Queen's uncle - also had the same name.

After Alice, which is also Paddy Power's favourite, the next most popular name with punters is Elizabeth at odds of 9-2, followed by Charlotte at 11-2, Victoria at 12-1, Alexandra at 14-1 and Diana at 16-1.

The Duchess of Cambridge held her last public engagements last week and will not be seen again officially until she leaves the Lindo Wing, the private maternity wing of London's St Mary's Hospital, with her second child. 

William Hill are accepting wagers on the date the baby will be born with odds suggesting it could be around April 21.

The firm's spokesman said: 'The Duchess is now on maternity leave and George could have a brother or sister within a month.'
