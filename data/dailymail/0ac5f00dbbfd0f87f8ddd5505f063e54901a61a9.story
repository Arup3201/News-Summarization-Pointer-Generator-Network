Aston Villa's form under Tim Sherwood finally looks to be hotting up with their 2-1 win against West Bromwich Albion - and midfielder Tom Cleverley celebrated by going out for a coffee with his partner Georgina Dorsett.

Cleverley started in the 2-1 Tuesday night win at Villa Park, Sherwood's first win as manager and a first Premier League win in almost three months, which certainly merited a low-key celebration.

And that's exactly what the on-loan Manchester United midfielder did, popping out to a local Costa Coffee branch in Cheshire with his partner and former The Only Way is Essex star Georgina.

Cleverley was substituted after 77 minutes in the Midlands derby on Tuesday night but drew praise from fans for his all-action box-to-box display before being replaced by Leandro Bacuna.

The midfielder is showing progress under Sherwood, and could be offered a permanent deal at Villa when his United contract runs out in the summer.

Until then though, the focus is on battling against relegation. Tuesday's win lifted Villa out of the drop zone, although they could fall back into trouble with Queens Park Rangers, Burnley and Leicester City all playing on Wednesday evening.

'I'm confident that what I'm telling the players is the correct thing to do,' Sherwood said after the win. 'But there is nothing like a win to cement that. It is huge for us.

'We have got a group that is not really suited for a relegation battle. The old-fashioned way is to battle but we have to play as if we are not in a relegation battle and pass the ball and move.

'If we go down we go down fighting.'

Cleverley will hope to keep his place in the side when Villa meet Albion again in the FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday.
