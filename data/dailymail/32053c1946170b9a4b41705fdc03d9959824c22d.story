Germany is to modernise its army by introducing flexible working hours that allow soldiers to take time off during school holidays and offering on-barracks daycare services for their children.

Defence Minister Ursula Von der Leyen said army bases will be fitted out with flat-screen TVs and minibars as part of of a €100million drive to make the armed forces more attractive to new recruits

The measures have been roundly attacked by army commanders, who described them as policies for 'sissies and wimps', with Ms Von der Leyen - Germany's first female defence minister - criticised for being out of touch with the real needs of the army.

General Harald Kujat, a retired former chief of staff of Germany’s armed forces, told Focus magazine that Ms Von der Leyen had no idea of the military, adding that her proposals were the ideas of a 'good housewife taking care of her children'.

In a separate interview he said the German army's outdated equipment was of far greater concern than the childcare and entertainment needs of soldiers, the Telegraph reported.

Germany's defence spending remains far behind that of other countries in Europe.

The country spends only 1.3 per cent of its GDP on its military, despite having signed a Nato agreement saying each member state's defence spending must be at least 2 per cent.

This has led to concern that Germany would struggle to defend itself if it came under attack - not least after US president Barack Obama urged 
European Nato members to increase their military budgets in order to 
defend against potential Russian aggression in Ukraine or the Baltic.

Ms Von der Leyen's €100million recruitment drive has therefore caused anger among those who have long demanded more money be made available to modernise weapons and defence systems.

Another concern is that the international image of the German army is at all time low, with its depleted workforce already seen as overly soft - particularly on recent peacekeeping missions in Afghanistan.

Ms Von der Leyen has defended her recruitment project however, saying the army had to modernise its childcare policies in order to compete with top businesses and attract the best staff.

Despite concerns over the strength of the German army, the country remains the world's third biggest arms exporter - behind only the U.S. and Russia.

Foreign sales of weaponry bring almost €1billion into the German economy every year.
