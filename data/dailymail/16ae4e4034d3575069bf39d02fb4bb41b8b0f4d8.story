An Air Canada passenger was rushed to hospital after a propeller broke loose, sliced through the cabin and smashed into her head.

Christina Kurylo was aboard a short-distance flight from Calgary to Grande Prairie that was forced to crash-land after a tire burst during take-off on Thursday night.

As the Jazz Aviation craft hit the ground in nearby Edmonton, the landing gear collapsed on the right side, sending one of five propellers through the wall of the plane.

Treated for bruising and concussion, Ms Kurylo said she is lucky to be alive. 

'I'm really lucky. It could have been a million times worse,' Kurylo told Global News. 'I could have died, you know, you never know what could have happened.

'All of a sudden I got hit in the head,' she said. 'It was pretty confusing for me. It's bits and pieces for me after that.' 

Melissa Menard, Kurylo's colleague at Rock 97.7 Radio in Grand Prairie, Alberta, was also aboard the flight, adding: 'Just from the blow of it happening she had quite a huge head lump and it was quite purple and lots of bruises and scratches.'

Kurylo was one of four passengers aboard the 75-person flight to be treated in the University of Alberta Hospital following the crash in Edmonton, Alberta, about 200 miles north of Calgary, where they took off. They have since been released.

The remaining 67 passengers and four crew members were evaluated by medical responders on the scene and released, Jazz Aviation said. 

Airline officials are now investigating the Q400 twin-engine turboprop for faults - though experts believe it could be back in service within months.

Scared: Kurylo said she couldn't tell what was going on as the cabin filled with smoke and she was hit 

Panic: The flight was forced to land in Edmonton after a tire burst during take-off from Calgary, Alberta

Emergency: Paramedics treated 67 passengers and four crew members at the scene and hospitalized four

Fears: This is not the first time a Jazz Aviation flight malfunctioned and Scandinavia Airlines grounded the craft

The craft blew a tire on takeoff and was unable to turn back to Calgary or continue the 450 miles to Grande Prairie, in north west Alberta.

It comes after Scandinavia Airlines grounded the same model following similar incidents in 2007.

Between March 2007 and August 2008, there were six incidents around the world.

And in January 2013, a landing gear wheel fell off an Air Canada Jazz plane as it landed.

David Deveau, vice president of Jazz Aviation, told CTV the firm has no concerns about the aircraft. 

'The Q-400, both the original and the next generation aircraft, are extremely robust,' he told CTV Edmonton. 'So we have no concerns about the gear.'
