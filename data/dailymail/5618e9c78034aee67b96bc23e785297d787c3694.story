They had endured the cataclysmic power of Typhoon Haiyan and the devastating tidal waves whipped up by the super-storm's 150pmh winds.

But now they were trapped in a flooded hotel with water waist-deep. Surrounded by fallen cables, the elderly and frail survivors were terrified.

Rescue, however, soon arrived. Wading through the hazardous courtyard, these men loaded them on to mattresses and began to ferry them to the relative safety of the hotel building in Leyte Province, in the Philippines.

The heroic rescue was captured on video by a reporter who warned guests about the cables in the water.

Residents caught in the centre of Typhoon Haiyan waded through water up to their waist as they rescued four elderly people trapped in the storm

There were fears the water in the courtyard had been electrified by fallen cables and the reporter said he could feel his legs 'tingling'

Despite the obvious dangers, the distressed and vulnerable people were all brought to the safety of the main hotel building where they were able to evacuate to the higher floors

He tells them: 'I can feel electricity in the water. My legs are tingling.'

The video shows the raw power of the storm that it is feared has left thousands in the Philippines dead.

It shows the hotel being battered by winds in excess of 150mph.

Trees are seen being bent under the force of the winds and at one point water can be seen pouring down the staircase of the hotel.

The reporter says off camera: 'So we have a storm surge starting to flood the ground floor of the hotel.

'Residents are evacuating up to the second floor.'Â 

The rescuers were in a race against time to bring the elderly residents to safety amid concerns about electricity in the waist-high flood water

Despite the obvious dangers to the rescuers, the four elderly people were brought through the flooded courtyard on top of mattresses.

The official death toll from the category five storm now stands at 2,275 but that is expected to rise sharply.

Yesterday, bodies were still being piled up on the side of the road and witnesses say there is little official counting of the dead.

The figures from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said 3,655 were injured, with a further 80 missing.

The hotel residents were forced to evacuate to higher floors when the ground floor became submerged by water

The storm, one of the most powerful on record, hit the country's eastern seaboard on Friday, destroying tens of thousands of buildings and displacing about 600,000 people.

A massive relief operation is underway, though many in the disaster zone have yet to see much assistance.

There are reports of widespread looting and even exchanges of gunfire between armed men and security forces amid drastic food shortages in the affected cities.
