When MTV Cribs hit the screens giving us a glimpse behind the doors of the homes of the rich and famous, property porn was born.

And it seems that Britain is a nation addicted.

Over 80 per cent of men and women admit they regularly look in estate agent windows and 74 per cent check property websites for homes that are beyond their budget.

Property porn is the new addiction and the UK is hooked

A third also conceded they have made an enquiry with an estate agent, and a further 20 per cent have even arranged to view a property they have no intention of purchasing or renting.

Addiction to property porn also appears to be rife within British neighbourhoods, with a surprising, 38 per cent of people confessing they make a habit out of snooping through their neighbours windows to get a glance at their decor.

Even more shockingly, a fifth of respondents say they have even gone as far as trespassing on someone else's property to get a proper look at their home or garden.

Of these 12 per cent have almost or actually been arrested, and a further 25 per cent have been given a telling off by the owner.

Property TV shows have put mansions on the map, and viewers can't get enough

It seems that the nation’s addiction to property porn is also borne out by the popularity of watching television property shows, with 77 per cent of Britons admitting it is one of their guilty pleasures.

When quizzed about what their number one purchase would be if they win the lottery, 54 per cent answered a luxury home, while an additional 26 per cent said they would be more inclined to buy a property if they knew a former owner was a celebrity.

The findings from the Home TV channel survey also reveal that 57 per cent of Brits dream of moving home abroad and leaving the UK behind, citing their top reasons as wanting to live in a warmer climate (37 per cent), having a better quality of life (28 per cent), or getting a change in scenery (10 per cent).

When it comes to the country that most appeals to Britons prepared to move abroad the USA came out top for 19 per cent, followed by Australia (16 per cent), and Spain (14 per cent).

The survey also asked what they imagined their ideal dream home would be like if money was no object for almost a third an old manor house was the preference, followed by a Mediterranean style villa for 31 per cent and a brand new grand mansion for 21 per cent.

When it comes to the décor, contemporary is the style that appeals to the majority of people, followed by a traditional theme.
