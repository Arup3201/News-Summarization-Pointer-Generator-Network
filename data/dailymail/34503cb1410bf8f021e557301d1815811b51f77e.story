Online suspicions: Jeremy Clarkson with his second wife Frances Cain

Jeremy Clarkson employed a companycaught up in the ‘Soca files’ blagging scandalto unmask an ‘online weirdo’ who had targetedhis family, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

The BBC host used the investigators to stop the man from distressing a member of his family after he posed as a British soldier who claimed to have served in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Mr Clarkson, who has three children, was suspicious of the online contact and called in investigators to try to unmask him.

He described the man as a ‘terrible online weirdo’ who had targeted a member of his family on the internet.

But he declined to give any further details about the targeting, only saying it wasn’t of a sexual nature.

The presenter and columnist had turned to a company which has worked with a private detective convicted of a conspiracy to ‘blag’ personal information for blue chip clients and wealthy individuals.

The company, Greymans, now known as Optimal Risk, specialises in handling problems and security issues for celebrities and high net worth individuals discreetly.

The Mail on Sunday has established that Greymans used the services of corrupt detective John Spears, who was imprisoned last year after an operation led by the Serious OrganisedCrime Agency (SOCA).

Mr Spears and three other private detectives all pleaded guilty to being involved in a conspiracy to trick banks and government agencies into handing over personal information about individuals.

It is believed that Greymans is on the SOCA list of the 102 companies and individuals linked tothe criminal investigators which has been passed to the Commons select committee.

In the Clarkson case, a source close to the firm claimed that Greymans used a private investigator to ‘blag’ the address of the ‘soldier’ by using a telephone number supplied by the man to a member of the family.

There is no suggestion that Greymans or Clarkson were aware that the private detective obtainedany information illegally.

Last night, Mr Clarkson, 53, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘About four years ago a member of my familywas
 contacted by a terrible online weirdo which was very shocking indeed. I
 became suspicious when I found out that the person who was targeting 
the family member claimed to be a soldier.

‘His story simply didn’t ring true. For example he said he was sent to Afghanistan straight from Iraq– and I know that doesn’t happen. So we decided to bring in a private investigation company. That firm was called Greymans.’

He
 went on: ‘They made some preliminary investigations and then reported 
to us advising that we needed to urgently contact the police and that is
 exactly what we did.

The 
family member received some guidance about handling communications with 
the weirdo. But the matter was resolved very quickly by the police and I
 am very grateful to them.’

Mr Clarkson added: ‘I do not know how the private investigators discovered the identity of the weirdo.And
 I certainly wasn’t aware of any alleged unlawful conduct. Greymans did 
find an address and a telephone number but I don’t know how this was 
done. They simply reported back to us to advise calling in the police. 
As with any family, we are all just grateful that this shocking thing is
 over.’

Founded by 
Falklands veteran and ex-Parachute Regiment Major Mike O’Neill, 56, 
Greymans was formed in 1993 and boasts that its clients include 
multinationals, finance houses and law firms.

Greymans last night failed to respond to questions about the Clarkson case.

Last
 week, Mr Clarkson was holidaying with the former beautician and 
masseuse Phillipa Sage on the Greek island of Mykonos where they were 
seen kissing in full view of other holidaymakers.

The
 presenter, who is reported to have earned more than £3 million last 
year from his television work, cut a relaxed figure in a floral shirt, 
blue shorts and blue driving loafers, while Ms Sage wore a striped 
bikini.

The blonde, who is employed by Brand Events, the firm behind Top Gear, and works as a freelanceron Top Gear Live, looked comfortable in Clarkson’s close-knit circle.

Mr Clarkson’s second wife of 20 years, Frances Cain, was nowhere to be seen.

In
 March, Clarkson lost his cool when approached by photographers 
following a day of sunbathing with Phillipa on a yacht in Australia.
