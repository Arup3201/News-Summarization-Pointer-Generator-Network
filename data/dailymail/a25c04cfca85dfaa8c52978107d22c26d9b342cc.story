This is what is known as a bad day at the office. A Spanish matador was gored in the backside, just weeks after returning to the sport after a career-threatening injury.

Rafael Cerro was thrown into the air by the charging 75 stone bull before being hit in the backside in front of hundreds of people at the Las Ventas bullring in Madrid.

Cerro, one of the rising stars of the 
sport, told his website that the clashes were one of the biggest 
'challenges' of his life.

Eye-watering: Cerro has only recently returned to the sport after suffering a 20cm gash to his stomach in a separate bullfight

In April, the 23-year-old needed surgery after he was gored by a bull in another bullfight.

He had to be treated in hospital when the bull's horn pierced his scrotum and reached his abdominal cavity, according to reports.

But, despite his recent injuries was confident that it would be a 'beautiful evening'.

His return started well yesterday when he killed a bull with a sword in front of hundreds of fans.

But things then did not go to plan after he was hurled into the air by another bull.

Spanish media said the 23-year-old tried to bluff the charging bull but was then flipped by the animal. As he fell, he was then gored in his backside.

However, Cerro only suffered bruising in the clash with the 75 stone bull.

He was not the only matador to have a bad day in the ring.

Sebastian Ritter was gored twice in the back of his leg forcing him to leave the ring.

Bullfighting is an ancient tradition in Spain and the season runs from March to October.

In another tradition, thousands of adrenaline-fueled 
sprinters took part in this year's first running of the bulls in 
France yesterday.

The 
annual event sees the five-foot-tall beasts, which are traditionally 
kept in an enclosed ring for brutal bull fights, unleashed in to a small
sectioned off area of Saint Sever.

Dressed
in traditional white clothing, these dramatic images show runners 
tripping over each other or falling to the ground as they try to flee 
the bulls sprinting through the streets of the province.

And, as is often the case in the running of the bulls, one runner was a bit too slow and gored in the leg after being cornered by a bull.

The injured runner is believed to have been taken to a local hospital to be treated for his wounds after the event known as encierro in Spain.

While some 'encierros' date back hundreds of years, the event in Saint Sever has only been running since 2003.

Its
started at twelve minutes past midday, the route covering a distance of
850 meters over and back across a prepared course through the city.

The
most well-known running of the bulls is the Pamplona during the San 
Fermin festival in Spain, which became world famous after the 
publication of Ernest Hemingway's 1926 novel The Sun Also Rises. The 
week-long event starts on July 7th.

Daring: Many of the participants wore the traditional white bull-running outfits while others opted for bright reds and greens

Ouch: One runner was wounded after being gored above the knee - a frequent occurrence during the running of the bulls

The injured runner is cheered by members of the crowd as he is taken to a local hospital for treatment
