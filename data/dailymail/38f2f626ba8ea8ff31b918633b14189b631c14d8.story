A zoo keeper blames himself for a near-death experience with a crocodile which ended with his thumb being ripped off - although he does admit that he has very scant memories of the traumatic event.

The owner of the reptile park, Ian Jenkins, was grabbed by a crocodile whilst performing in front of a large crowd,  at Snakes Downunder Reptile Park and Zoo near Childers, south of Bundaberg,far north Queensland .

In extremely distressing scenes, the 58-year-old was dragged into the pond at which point the four-metre croc ‘Macca’ started a death roll.

Thanks to the quick thinking of his fellow worker, Louise Smith, Jenkins escaped with his life.

‘I’m relieved but also so annoyed,' Mr Jenkins told Seven News from hospital after the incident.

'You just don’t get yourself into that situation with a crocodile!'

‘It was just a bit of a brain freeze I think.’

This four-metre long crocodile 'Macca' is responsible for the attack - although Mr Jenkins says he is responsible and fellow handler, Louise Smith, agrees that the croc is typically very docile

The people who viewed the terrifying ordeal, including many horrified young children. are still trying to come to grips with the vicious attack.

It was a horrific sight during what was meant to be a fun holiday activity for families.

Witness Emma Murray Bryant is clearly still in shock, her lip quivering with emotion as she struggles to tell the story of Ian Jenkins’ lucky escape.

‘He kneeled down and put his hat near his nose and the croc snapped and you knew…' Ms Bryant told Seven News.

‘It didn’t look good. Then the croc snapped at him the second time and that’s when he got him.’

She says she keeps replaying the sickening sound of the two ‘snaps’ she heard in mind, reliving the moments that Macca set on his keeper.

Mr Jenkins' colleague Louise Smith is humble, explaining that intervening during a crisis is all a part of her job description.

It is protocol that a second handler must be at hand during the crocodile show, just in case something doesn’t go to plan.

Jenkin's thumb was bitten off and also suffered head injuries and was airlifted to hospital in stable condition

She used a stick to repetitively whack the crocodile on the head until he reluctantly 'spat out' her co-worker.

‘I just tried to distract (the crocodile) to give me and Ian a chance to get out of there.’ 

After his crocodile attack, the 58-year-old was airlifted to Bundaberg Base Hospital, also sporting a head injury.

He has since been transferred to Brisbane Hospital and has already undergone hours of surgery to try and reconstruct his mangled hand.

It's understood that the ordeal all began when Mr Jenkins attempted to gain the attention of Macca by holding a chicken in his right hand.

Instead, Macca caught Jenkins unawares as he lunged at his other hand. 

A section of his left hand was torn down to the wrist, but the modest animal-lover supposedly apologised profusely to the paramedics for 'causing such a fuss'.  

It is understood the man was visiting the Snakes Downunder Reptile Park and Zoo near Childers in Queensland

This is far from his first serious injury inflicted on the job. 

Five years ago, Mr Jenkins survived an eastern brown snake bite, which left him fighting for his life. 

He was also bitten by a king brown in 2003 and two black snakes before that. 

In January 2010, he was preparing an eastern brown snake for an educational show when he was bitten through a bag, causing the father to collapse and lose consciousness. 

The then 51-year-old was transported by air to Bundaberg Base Hospital, placed in intensive care and treated with two doses of anti-venom. 

He was back performing his snake show just hours after discharging himself from hospital. 

The reptile handler has lived in Australia for around 30 years, after his passion for reptiles was born during his childhood in Kenya, Africa.

He is thoroughly knowledgeable about the scaled critters and his wife Barbara Jenkins insists that her husband does not seek out danger.

Rather, his passion for reptiles and his desire to educate people are the motivations behind his career choice, according to his supportive wife, Ms Jenkins.

Mr Jenkins previously said that his primary concern is his family and that he hates to cause them distress when he suffers an animal-inflicted injury.  

It was business as usual at the park the day after the attack, bar the crocodile feeding shows - although they are planned to continue as soon as Mr Jenkins' injuries are fully heeled and he returns in the ring.

Ms Smith insists that Macca is normally very pleasant and calm and this ‘hangry’ outburst was very unlike him.

However, they will never forget this very violent wake up call.

Paramedics were called to the zoo at 12.55pm local time, a Queensland Ambulance Service spokesman told Daily Mail Australia
