A 40-year-old New Hampshire man who inadvertently revealed his identity in anonymous YouTube videos about his marijuana-growing operation was sentenced to a year in jail today.

Police say Kyle Berry's how-to-grow-marijuana videos on YouTube were posted anonymously last fall, but his face was reflected off a shiny surface and a package showed his name.

Berry, of Auburn, pleaded guilty to manufacturing a controlled drug. It was alleged that as many as 35 videos were posted on YouTube.

Berry said he was growing the marijuana for his own use, WMUR-TV reported.

Assistant Rockingham County Attorney Jerome Blanchard said: 'Showing how to grow it, how to set it up, what chemicals he uses, where he gets his seeds. He's very detailed about how he's doing it.' [sic]

The authorities were tipped off about the videos and one dated October 17, 2012, showed a package from the United Kingdom packed with marijuana seeds.

The package had Berry's name on it and was visible in the video.

Berry's name was also seen on this package, filled with marijuana seeds, in the YouTube video, which led police to identify him

Berry claimed he was growing the substance to deal with his pain after 17 surgeries, not to make money from the drug.

'I did it because since 13, I've had 17 surgeries. I didn't realize how bad the medication I was on was clouding my judgement and killing me', he said in court.

Judge Marguerite Wageling says she had a hard time believing that he was growing the plants only for himself, but agreed with Berry's lawyer that he was not a drug kingpin.

Berry was sentenced Tuesday to a year in jail, with four months suspended, and fined $500.
