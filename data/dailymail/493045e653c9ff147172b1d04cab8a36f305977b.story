A South Korean newspaper has sparked outrage by claiming the atomic bombing of Hiroshima that killed 200,000 people in Japan during World War II was a 'divine punishment'.

JoongAng Ilbo, which is one of the biggest South Korean daily newspapers, published the claims in a comment piece by one of its 'editorial writers' Kim Jin in both its English and Korean editions.

The article suggested that Japan deserved both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki wartime atomic bombings in 1945 because of its lethal experiments on humans during the conflict.

It read: 'God often borrows the hand of a human to punish the evil deeds of men.'

The piece went on to claim that the two attacks were the retribution of god because of the country's infamous biological and chemical research facility, Unit 731, which carried out brutal experiments on humans.

Tthe article read: 'These bombings were divine punishment and human retaliation at the same time. 

'Tokyo, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were 
revenge for the Asians steamrolled by Japan’s militaristic nationalism, 
especially the “Maruta,” the human beings used in experiment by a covert
biological warfare research team in China called Unit 731.

The United States attacked the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic bombs during the final stages of World War II in 1945. The two events are the only use of nuclear weapons in war to date.

The war in Europe ended when Nazi Germany surrendered on May 8, but the Pacific War continued.

Together with the UK and the Republic of China, the United States called for the surrender of Japan, threatening the country with 'prompt and utter destruction'. The Japanese government ignored this ultimatum.

American airmen then dropped an atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, followed with another over Nagasaki on August 9.

Within the first two to four months of the bombings, the acute effects killed 90,000–166,000 people in Hiroshima and 60,000–80,000 in Nagasaki, with roughly half of the deaths in each city occurring on the first day.

On August 15, six days after the bombing of Nagasaki, Japan announced its surrender to the Allies, signing the Instrument of Surrender on September 2, officially ending World War II. 

'The cries (of the unit's victims) 
reached heaven and the bombs were dropped on Tokyo and the atomic 
weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.'

And in an ominous paragraph, the piece went on to threaten: 'God may feel that retaliation against Japan hasn't been complete.'

Japan has reacted angrily to the article in the newspaper which has a circulation of 1.8million.

Yoshihide Suga, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, labelled the remarks as 'quite dishonourable', telling a press conference: 'We strongly protested to the staff of South Korea's Joongang Ilbo daily.

'Our country is the only atom-bombed nation. We will never forgive such remarks.'

The two countries have a long-standing animosity continuing nearly seven decades because of Japan's 69-year-long occupation of South Korea until the end of the Second World War.

But the newspaper article comes amid growing tensions between the two countries in the past week.

The Japanese mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto, triggered an international outcry after stating that South Korea's wartime sex slaves known as 'comfort women' were 'necessary' while three Japanese historians visited the disputed territory of South Korean-controlled Takeshima islets, known as Dokdo by Korea.
