Super-rich Hans Rausing will move from his Belgravia mansion - where his wife tragically died from a drug overdose two years ago - after snapping up Roman Abramovich's luxury home in Chelsea for £28.5million.

The 50-year-old heir to the Tetra Pak fortune, worth around £4.4bn, is said to have paid in cash for the grade II-listed building last December.

Now he has submitted plans for remodelling works, which will include landscaped gardens, servants' quarters and a new entrance.

According to documents submitted to 
Kensington and Chelsea council, Rausing will employ garden designer 
Arabella Lennox-Boyd to replant the grounds.

The
 property comprises several conjoined houses, including a grade II 
listed Georgian town house and a grade II* listed mansion dating from 
the 1670s.

Chelsea owner Abramovich and his girlfriend Dasha Zhukova bought the mansion for £25m in 2011.

They submitted plans for a lavish £10m basement development, but these were met with fierece opposition from local residents.

Previous
 occupants of the sprawling mansion, which boasts a 50ft drawing room 
overlooking Battersea Bridge, include late Conservative minister Paul 
Channon and artist James Whistler.

The
 exclusive address will provide a fresh start for Rausing away from his 
£70m town house in Belgravia, where police discovered the decomposing 
remains of his American wife during a drugs raid in July 2012.

She
 had died from an overdose, but Rausing had hidden her body for two 
months while maintaining a desperate pretence to servants that she was 
still alive.

Rausing was convicted last July of preventing her lawful burial and handed a ten-month suspended jail term.

The judge at Isleworth Crown Court said Rausing was a tragic warning of the ‘utterly destructive’ effects of drug abuse.

Rausing
 - whose Swedish grandfather founded the lucrative food packaging firm 
in 1951 - met Eva Kemeny while they were both enrolled on a drugs rehabilitation programme.

They married in 1992 and had four children, but both struggled with their addictions.

In July 2012 Rausing was stopped by police and arrested for possession of class A drugs.

It was during a subsequent raid on his home that police made their grim discovery of his wife's body.

Following his trial, Rausing moved out of his Belgravia house to undergo a rehabilitation programme at a private clinic.

There was speculation he would move back in following redevelopment work for a subterranean swimming pool, wine cellar and cigar room.

However, sources say it will be put for sale later this year.
