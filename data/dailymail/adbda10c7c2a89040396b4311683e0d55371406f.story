Pensive: Kate looked beautiful as usual but despite an incredible show of strength, at times she looked very thoughtful about the day's events

France has draconian privacy laws but punishments for breaking them are paltry.

Nevertheless, politicians, the powerful and the wealthy happily use them to hide their secrets.

Experts say Closer is undoubtedly breaking French law by publishing topless pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge in Provence.

But the magazine is likely to be willing to take the risk of a small fine in return for a huge boost in sales and revenue.

The French constitution states that ‘everyone has the right to privacy’ and potentially prevents the media from disclosing intimate details about an individual’s private life as well as taking unsolicited photographs

The system allowed former president François Mitterrand to conceal the existence of his second family and daughter Mazarine up to his death.

The French learned about disgraced former banker Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s sexual proclivities only when he was accused of rape in New York.

And president Francois Hollande’s girlfriend, Valérie Trierweiler, who works for Paris Match, is demanding £20,000 in damages from Closer for printing pictures of her in a bikini this summer.

Miss Trierweiler, 47, has already been awarded £1,200 after the highly unflattering snaps appeared in glossy French magazine VSD.

Closer has branded the First Lady’s 
demand as ‘the height of hypocrisy’ and magazine editor Laurence Pieau 
has issued a full page statement attacking Miss Trierweiler – published 
on the page after its photos of topless Kate.

‘How dare she complain,’ said Miss Pieau. ‘She was on a private beach in the south of France, but in full view of the boats hired by the paparazzi.

'She must have known she was going to be photographed. And she even works for a magazine that printed them.’ 

Breach of privacy is a criminal offence 
carrying a maximum sentence of a year in prison and a £36,000 fine for 
the editor but fines sometimes amounting to a single euro are regularly 
handed down.

Criminal lawsuits are rare with people 
generally suing through the civil courts, which can order an apology 
from the publication as well as damages.

Thomas Roussineau, who specialises in privacy law, said the photos of the Duchess were totally forbidden. ‘The castle is not the street, it is in a private place, and they are intimate pictures,’ he said.

Mr Roussineau said it was likely the 
magazine had weighed up the potential cost of a fine, that he suggested 
would be around £24,000, against the revenue the photos would bring.

‘They will have a big revenue, and the amount of the sentence will not equal the revenue they will make,’ he added.
