Cathy Churchman has been trying to draw a line under Eric Cantona's kung-fu kick for 20 years.

'I'm 60 now, by the time the 30th anniversary comes around I'll be 70 - I probably won't be able to remember what happened,' the Crystal Palace supporter told Sportsmail.

'I just hope that now the 20 year anniversary is over, we can start to stop talking about it.'

The prospect of that seems highly unlikely, such is the lasting imprint that night has made on English football folklore.

For those of you who don't know, Churchman is the person stood just to the right of Matthew Simmons - the target of Cantona's fury that night - that night.

It's not an exaggeration to say, it could have been her.

'After it happened I remember looking down at my coat and seeing a scuff mark from Eric's boot, that's how close it was to being me,' she said.

'I just wanted to get out the way, you could see it in Eric's eyes.

'Could it have been me? Absolutely.'

Churchman jokes that her immediate thoughts upon seeing replays of the incident when she arrived home after that fateful night was that it was it was 'time for a new hairdo'.

But the seriousness of the implications following that night would soon dawn on her.

Churchman would become central to the subsequent court cases for Cantona and Simmons given her proximity to the incident.

She maintains the story Cantona was reacting to a racial slur from Simmons is one hard to believe given the noise reverberating around Selhurst Park in the seconds leading up to Cantona's kick following the Frenchman's sending off.

Not that is a defence of Simmons in anyway.

During his trial for threatening language and behaviour, Simmons launched himself at the prosecution after being found guilty.

Churchman, who was in court, recalls: 'It was a foolish act. The whole thing started with a kick from Cantona and that was how it ended with Simmons doing the same.

'Twenty years on, do I ever pay Simmons a thought? To be honest, no.

'I've heard he still goes to games sometimes, even though he has been banned from Selhurst Park.' 

The French forward was found guilty of assault at Croydon Magistrates Court as a result of the incident

He was banned from English football by the FA for eight months and ordered to carry out community service

Cantona spent five years at Manchester United before retiring in 1997 at the age of 30
