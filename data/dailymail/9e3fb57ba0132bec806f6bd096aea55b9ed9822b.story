Worrying: An Oklahoma man took precaution after finding a thermos, like this one, on his lawn

Lettuce all take this seriously, authorities have said.

An Oklahoma City police briefing station was brought to a standstill on Thursday after a man arrived with a suspicious package.

The resident arrived at the Santa Fe office at 9000 s Santa Fe Ave, with a thermos-like container.

He told police he had the container on his front lawn and, when he noticed tin foil protruding from the lid, he became worried.

It was also quite heavy when he picked it up.

According to Police Capt. Dexter Nelson, the officers who dealt with the situation treated it as seriously as they would another threat.

They told the man to leave the container outside.

They then called the bomb squad.

The bomb squad arrived and performed an x-ray of the item, Nelson said.

However a routine examination of the thermos determined that it held a burrito.

Following an examination by the bomb squad, it was determined that inside the suspicious thermos-like container was a burrito. However police have warned much can be learned from the situation, in that potentially dangerous packages should be left where they are and reporter, not brought into police stations

While the incident is easy to laugh off, Nelson said a serious lesson can be taken from it.

He said that, in the case of people finding suspicious materials, they should leave it where it is and report the matter to police.

'If you think it might or could be dangerous, you should not touch or move it,' he said.

'Call the authorities and we will investigate it there.'

Upon arriving at this Sante Fe police briefing station, the worried Oklahoma resident was told by officers to leave the container out front and the bomb squad was called in
