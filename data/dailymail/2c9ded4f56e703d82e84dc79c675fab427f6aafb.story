Scottish First Minister Alex Salomd has been accused of 'trying to cover up' expenses

Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has been accused of covering up a £3,000 expenses claim that paid for a four-night stay at a top Chicago hotel.

The five-star Peninsula Hotel has confirmed that the First Minister booked one of its grand deluxe suites when he visited the city to promote Scottish independence.

The ‘Team Scotland’ delegation were there to make a handful of speeches during the time of the Ryder Cup in 2012, but the majority stayed in a more modest hotel near the Medinah course, which charges £60 for a room.

However Mr Salmond and his wife Moira chose a suite at the Peninsula – which is popular with such celebrities as Beyonce and Brad Pitt – even though it was much further away.

He has consistently refused Freedom of Information requests to reveal how much he spent at the public’s expense, dismissing criticism of the trip as ‘ridiculous frippery’.

And Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon even claimed that she was ‘flabbergasted’ to be asked about the bill during a debate last week.

But last night, after the hotel revealed how much he paid to stay at the luxury suite, Mr Salmond was facing new calls to ‘come clean’ about his use of public funds.

His suite usually costs guests at least £1,164 per night. Civil servants managed to get the room for $1,194 per night – £740 using the exchange rate at the time – because they also booked rooms for other members of the delegation at the same time.

This meant that the bill for Mr Salmond’s room alone would have come to nearly $5,000, or £2,956, for the four-night stay. And the delegation’s total bill at the hotel was almost £10,000.

The Peninsula has seven grand deluxe suites, which all have more than 1,000sq ft of floor space, a guest ‘powder room’, a spacious living room, a dressing area and a surround-sound stereo system.

Mr Salmond would have been treated to panoramic views of Lake Michigan and the city’s historic Water Tower Park.

There are also three flat-screen televisions in each suite, mood lighting and PlayStation games consoles.

Last night opponents called for an investigation into his spending, with Scottish Labour’s Paul Martin MSP saying: ‘It is time for Alex Salmond to come clean about his Chicago trip.

‘For a year and a half he has refused to say how much taxpayers’ money he spent on himself.

‘Now we know that he spent thousands on himself to stay in luxury at a five-star hotel.’

He added: ‘There are still thousands of pounds not properly accounted for. Everyone in Scotland will be asking themselves what does Alex Salmond have to hide.

‘If he won’t come clean we need an Audit Scotland investigation into what he spent our money on.’

Mr Salmond previously charged the taxpayer more than £250 for a pair of tartan trousers on a visit to China – and then spent the next seven months attempting to hide his failure to pay the money back.
