Never one to do things by halves, when Rihanna had some of her Instagram posts censored for breaching the site's nudity rules she duly upped and left.

Leaving her over 12 million followers bereft for an entire six months, the 26-year-old singer made a much lauded return to the social media site this week.

Already posting a few controversial snaps - one in particular that sees her leading the Instagram icon around like a dog on a lead - she has made it clear that her hiatus has not dampened her somewhat controversial spirit.

Rihanna only returned to Instagram on Saturday after a six month break and is already returning to her old controversial self, posting this cartoon of her leading her 'haters' and Instagram around on dog leads 

In the few days she has been back on Instagram she has already posted several sexy shots, including this rather busty one of her as a ninja turtle for Halloween 

Known for skirting perilously close to the boarders of acceptable - even before her nudity faux pas- Rihanna's Instagram was known for the non-too-subtle promotion of smoking marijuana and a seriously high level of barely clothed snaps of the singer. 

In fact, so body confident is the Bajan beauty that it seemed like every other snap consisted of her clad in little more than a pair of knickers.

Rihanna announced her return by posting this upside down selfie with the words 'Hellurrr #badgalback' 

Showing she plans to be no less sexy than before the singer also posted this snap at Halloween which sees her in a raunchy ninja turtle outfit licking a large sword 

Not that her followers were complaining. As one of the most followed celebrities on Instagram Rihanna's posts regularly received upwards of 500,000 likes each.

But besides the obvious attraction of her near-naked form, fans flocked to her account because it offered them a behind-the-scenes and often intimate view of the singer's private life.

Often pictured on or around private jets, or surrounded by bags of designer shopping, Rihanna isn't afraid to show off the super luxury lifestyle her fame affords her.

As well as pictures backstage, on the campaign trail and in the recording studio, Rihanna  shared glimpses of her personal life, often from her many varied fabulous holiday destinations.

From make-up free selfies to pictures with her family in her home country of Barbados and endless snaps with her tight knit group of friends, fans ate up the insight Instagram gave them to their idol's private life.
