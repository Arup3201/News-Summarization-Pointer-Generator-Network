A passenger in this taxi would be watching the meter with gritted teeth.

Three friends are driving 32,000 miles half-way round the world from London to Sydney - in a black cab.

Paul Archer, Leigh Purnell, both 23, and Johno Ellison, 27, have so far clocked up more than 17,000 miles since they set off from the capital on February 17.

The mammoth journey has seen them drive through herds of sheep in Armenia and get stuck in a snow-covered ditch in Finland.

The three pals even evaded capture by the Taliban in Pakistan and were quizzed by secret police in Iran.

But the friends were hoping that they had as much luck as they prepared to enter strict Communist state China where they expected to encounter difficulties using the internet.

So far on their route they have passed through Paris, Finland, Georgia,  Italy, Turkey and India.  

They have around 12,000 more miles to go which will include passing through Thailand, Indonesia and large parts of Australia before they reach Sydney.

If the meter was turned on, the bill when a passenger reached the Australian city would be a staggering £70,000.

The three explorers from Aston University are hoping to set a new record for the longest taxi trip and raise £20,000 for the Red Cross.

Mr Ellison said that their specially adapted black cab, nicknamed Hannah, was strong and they were expecting to reach Sydney in one piece.
