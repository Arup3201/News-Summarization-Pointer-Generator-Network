Benoit Assou-Ekotto has been left out of Tottenham’s Premier League squad by manager Mauricio Pochettino.

The Cameroon international has fallen out of favour with the new Spurs boss and the left back’s future at White Hart Lane looks to be in doubt.

Following the form of Danny Rose, who has been recently called up to the England squad, and new addition Ben Davies, there are limited chances at left-back this season at Tottenham.

The top flight clubs were required to submit their squad to the Premier League by Wednesday evening and there appears to be no room for the French-born defender – even though the club only registered 23 players.

Assou-Ekotto has been at the Lane for eight years, making 155 appearances, and was shipped out on loan to recently promoted QPR last year.

The 30-year-old sparked controversy at the World Cup after lashing out at team-mate Benjamin Moukandjo following Cameroon’s 4-0 thrashing by Croatia.
