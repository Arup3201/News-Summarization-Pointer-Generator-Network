In an attempt to branch out onto all things Australian, reddit Australia has encouraged users to post their favourite pictures of Australian life and engage in good spirited discussion.

The photo thread was so successful, reddit has decided to make it happen every 21st of every month!

From having a 'cuppa' with a rainbow lorikeet, to saying 'cheese' at 4am eating a slice of pizza, users continue to post their favourite Aussie pictures to 'It's the 21st! So post your Random Aussie Photo'.

Here are some of the photos shared by reddit Australians...

'Can i share more than one?' A keen reddit poster eager to post all of his photos taken from his 3 day, 1300km bike trip from Orange - Canberra - Jindabyne - Albury - Orange. He says 'Alpine road is the BEST road I've ever ridden!'

Who wants a slice? Users admit to be jealous after seeing this Aussie boy with his pizza at 4am. He tells reddit Australia 'it's home-made and made I'm moderately intoxicated, please excuse it'

Bullseye! 'Friendly fire'
