Scientists have warned  massive agricultural expansion in Tanzania could lead to a 'perfect storm' for human plague transmission by encouraging an increase in the number of disease-carrying rats.

A new study published yesterday in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene by researchers from the University of California found that the expansion of crop lands by 70 per cent over recent years has caused the number of plague-carrying rodents to double.

Rats which live in human areas are also particularly competent hosts for plague and are more likely to interact with humans, increasing the chance of humans being bitten by plague-infected fleas.

A study  found the expansion of croplands  in Tanzania has caused the number of disease-carrying rats to double in recent years - increasing the chance of humans being bitten by plague-infected fleas

In the report scientists linked an increase in corn fields – necessary to feed an expanding population – to a 20-fold rise in the population of African rats in northern Tanzania.

These rats transmit deadly diseases to humans, including Lassa fever and plague.

Hillary Young, a University of California professor and a lead author of the study, said: 'We found that introducing maize production in natural areas appears to create a perfect storm for plague transmission.

'Local farmers often then store this harvested corn next to or inside their homes - baiting in the hungry field rats and increasing opportunities for human infection. 

'These kinds of conditions are what breed outbreaks.' 

The report warned these numbers could rise as new wilderness areas become farmland and rat populations increase.

Though less deadly than Ebola or other epidemics, plague – caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis is fatal in more than 30 percent of cases if left untreated, the study said.

The bubonic plague remains one of the most destructive pandemics in history which peaked in Europe between 1348 and 1350

As Africa's population soars, and food demand increases, scientists, farmers and politicians will have to balance the need for more farmland with concerns over the spread of disease, the scientists added.

Most of the plague outbreaks recorded since 2000 have taken place in Africa.

A recent outbreak in Madagascar saw 263 people infected and 71 deaths.

In Tanzania, there have been over 8,000 cases over the last 30 years, including 675 deaths, The International Business Times reported.

The scientists studied three areas of northern Tanzania where plague outbreaks have been documented in the past and where maize production has expanded over recent times.  

Concluding, the authors said: 'Lessons learned from this case are also broadly important for understanding the dynamics of other zoonotic diseases in this era of rapid landscape change.'

Bubonic plague is one of the most devastating diseases in history, having killed around 100million people during the 'Black Death' in the 14th century.Drawings and paintings from the outbreak, which wiped out about a third of the European population, depict town criers saying 'bring out your dead' while dragging trailers piled with infected corpses.

It is caused by a bacterium known as Yersinia pestis, which uses the flea as a host and is usually transmitted to humans via rats.

The disease causes grotesque symptoms such as gangrene and the appearance of large swellings on the groin, armpits or neck, known as 'buboes'.

It kills up to two thirds of sufferers within just four days if it is not treated, although if antibiotics are administered within 24 hours of infection patients are highly likely to survive.

After the Black Death arrived in 1347 plague became a common phenomenon in Europe, with outbreaks recurring regularly until the 18th century.

Bubonic plague has almost completely vanished from the rich world, with 90 per cent of all cases now found in Africa.

However, there have been a few non-fatal cases in the U.S. in recent years, while in August 2013 a 15-year-old boy died in Kyrgyzstan after eating a groundhog infected with the disease.

Three months later, an outbreak in a Madagascan killed at least 20 people in a week. A year before 60 people died as a result of the infection, more than in any other country in the world.

Outbreaks in China have been rare in recent years, and most have happened in remote rural areas of the west.

China's state broadcaster said there were 12 diagnosed cases and three deaths in the province of Qinghai in 2009, and one in Sichuan in 2012.

In the United States between five and 15 people die every year as a result, mostly in western states.
