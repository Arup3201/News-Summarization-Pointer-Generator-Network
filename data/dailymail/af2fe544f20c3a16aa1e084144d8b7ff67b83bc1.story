With the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's time in Sydney well behind us, it's time to muse on Kate's impeccable Royal Tour wardrobe and celebrate her evolving style from girl-next-door to a very modern - and stylish - princess.

Now one of the most famous women in the world, the last three years have been a time of huge change for the former Kate Middleton - so could it all be down to one lady?

Introducing Natasha Archer.

Natasha - or Tash as she is fondly known within the royal circle - has been helping Kate remodel her style. 

Who's that girl? Natasha Archer - or 'Tash' as she is fondly known within the royal circle - is described as a Kensington Palace PA but has reportedly been helping revamp the Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe

Natasha, also described as a 'Kensington Palace PA', was part of Kate’s close entourage on tour and, according to Grazia, has been helping Kate, 32, look more 'regal' as per the Queen's request.

Natasha first caught the world's attention last July when she was one of the only people - aside from the Royal family - seen entering the Lindo Wing after the birth of Prince George.

The PA, who studied Hispanic Studies at King's College London, was seen carrying a dress bag and baby car seat, leading the world to question whether she hand-picked the now iconic blue and white polkadot dress that Kate stepped out in.

She was also spotted landing in Wellington, New Zealand with Kate’s hairdresser, Amanda Cook Tucker, as the royal family embarked on the first leg of their tour last fortnight.

Close confidante: The source revealed that Natasha and Kate get on very well and the PA has reportedly always supported and advised Kate

Natasha has reportedly been helping Kate with her outfit choices since last summer. A source told the fashion magazine: 'Natasha’s main role is as a PA, but over the last few months she has assisted Kate as a style adviser.

'Natasha and Kate get on very well. She has always supported and advised Kate - and the Duchess loves Natasha’s style, so it seemed like an obvious appointment. Natasha has been helping Kate pick outfits for the tour.’

The source also added that Natasha orders lots of clothes - particularly from Topshop and Asos - online for Kate.

And it seems that with Natasha's 
advice, Kate, who has worn outfits by the likes of Emilia Wickstead, 
Erdem, Alexander McQueen, Jenny Packham and Roksanda Illincic throughout the tour of Australia and New Zealand, has 
dressed to impress.

Australia's top fashion designers have
 heaped huge praise on the Duchess of Cambridge's royal tour wardrobe - despite her snubbing all but one of them.

Classic
 designer Carla Zampatti - who has met the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince 
Edward, Prince Charles and Diana - applauded Kate's 'wonderful taste' 
and the fact she was a 'hard working royal', as she attended a reception
 for the Royal couple at Parliament House, Canberra.

Ms Zampatti even went so far as to label the 32-year-old 'the best promotion of the fashion industry' she can think of.

And it isn't just the designers praising Kate's style - it seems the general public love it, too.

The 'Kate Effect' was in full force 
after the Duchess of Cambridge stepped out in a Diane Von Furstenberg 
wrap dress for the second day of the royal couple's visit to Australia.

Kate
 wore a £292 new season blue and white patterned wrap dress from the 
high-end designer to visit the Blue Mountains town of Winnmalee, just 
outside of Sydney.

The 31-year-old is 
known for making fashion fly off the shelves as fans aim to emulate her 
style, but the blue and white wrap dress sold out at a particularly 
surprising speed of just eight minutes, according to fashion website Go Fug Yourself.

Celebrity stylist, Jade Elliott, says she has it spot on: 'Kate's graduated from princess finishing school - no more 
student chic, she's a "royal" - its official!'

His wife may be better known as a 
style icon but it seems that Prince William spent his time in New Zealand and Australia trailblazing a new trend -
 and he probably isn't even aware.

While
 all eyes were on the Duchess of Cambridge's dazzling dresses, her 
husband William was  quietly championing the hottest new hipster 
trend: normcore.

Plain
 tees, comfortable shoes, understated anoraks and dad jeans are 
apparently no longer simply tolerated by the fashion community, they are 
applauded. Bland, it appears, is the new black and just blending in with the crowd a la Prince William is totally en vogue.

Prince of style: William has been adhering to the 'normcore' trend of scruffy trainers and chinos during his time in New Zealand - but is it just a coincidence?

A hybrid of the words 'normal' and 'hardcore', The Telegraph's Ellie Pither outlines the normcore rules.

She
 writes: 'The normcore uniform is as follows: Teva sandals (those 
foam-soled sandals with Navajo patterned velcro straps); Patagonia 
waterproof jackets; New Balance trainers; white athletic socks; boxy 
stonewash mum-cut jeans; Uniqlo roll-necks; beige Gap chinos.'

And
 it seems that William, 31, has got the look spot on - save for his 
Onitsuka trainers, which could be replaced by some on-trend all-black 
New Balance or Air Max - and voila: Prince normcore.

Normcore seems to have emerged as an 
offshoot of fashion's love affair with all things Nineties.

Marc
 Jacobs 
and Prada both created high fashion versions of Teva hiking sandals for 
spring 2014, Topshop is selling 'mum' jeans and even Chanel
sent models, including Cara Delevingne and Kendall Jenner, who both 
embrace the trend in their downtime, down a supermarket aisle clad in 
sweatpants and sneakers.

The result is that brand-less 
stonewash denim, nondescript zip-up tops and bulky white trainers have 
suddenly become cool, and lining shelves at stores from Acne and APC to 
Madewell and ASOS.

Even President Barack Obama is being hailed as a style icon for the normcore set.

Fashion
 writer and blogger Simon Glazin isn't, however, convinced that William 
is on trend and his New Zealand wardrobe is just a coincidence.

He said: '"Normcore", "American tourist", call it what you will, but really it's nothing new.

'This
 is the "trend" (I use inverted commas because quite frankly I can't 
bring myself to call it something fashion noteworthy) that A-listers 
like Ashton Kutcher have been trying to make cool for a long time.

'By all means men, wear chinos with 
trainers and an Oxford shirt, it can be a "cool" look, but I think in 
William's case it's more accidental style than anything else'

'Do we actually think William wakes up
 in the morning, splashes some royal water over his face, looks into his
 wardrobe and says to himself: "How can I age myself by 40 years today?"

'No.
 It's more tradition with him than anything else. As next in line to the
 throne, and with his dad as his style icon, he needs to remain 
"vanilla".

'Harry 
pushes things a bit further by a) wearing no clothes at all, and b) 
actually looking good most of the time in what he does chose to put on.

'By
 all means men, wear chinos with trainers and an Oxford shirt, it can be
 a "cool" look, but I think in William's case it's more accidental style
 than anything else.

'And one hopes at least one half of this royal couple is actually BUYING new clothes rather than recycling them from years ago.'
