A teenager cradled his dying mother after she and his girlfriend were hit by a car in a double tragedy.

Jane MacDonald, 38, and Abby Hucknall, 18, were fatally injured as they walked to the shops in Kirkcaldy, Fife.

Miss Hucknall had recently moved into a nearby flat with her boyfriend, 19-year-old Joe Jones, Miss MacDonald’s son.

The two women were crossing busy Dunnikier Road in the town when they were struck.

It is thought Mr Jones was so close to the scene that he heard the impact and rushed to be with his mother and the woman he calls his wife.

He sobbed last night as he said: ‘I heard a scream and then a bang. I stood in between them. Abby’s eyes were still open, my mum’s were closed.

‘She was only 38 and Abby was only 18. And they’re gone. My mum and my wife, both of them gone. My mum and my wife were just crossing the road and got hit by a Land Rover and killed.

‘My mum was a great mum and the loveliest person. She stuck by me all the way. And my wife Abby – we loved each other to bits. We weren’t married but to me she was Abby Jones, my wife.’

Miss Hucknall and Miss MacDonald, both from Kirkcaldy, were heading to a nearby supermarket for bread and milk at 6:30pm on Tuesday when they were hit by a black Land Rover Discovery on the east-bound carriageway.

An off-duty nurse was first on the scene and emergency services arrived within minutes.

Sam Clark, 35, who was driving ahead of the Land Rover, described how she saw what happened and rushed to help.

The staff nurse, who had just picked up her children from their child minder, said: ‘I was in the car in front. I saw the impact in my rear view mirror and stopped the car. I told my two kids to stay in the  car and I went to phone an ambulance.

‘I didn’t see where they came from but I saw the impact and the girls being hit by the car. They seemed to be hit simultaneously.

‘The Land Rover stopped very quickly, as did I. We just got out and tried to help.

‘I went to the older woman, just a petite woman, and checked for a pulse. She had a very weak pulse at that point. I knew what to do from the life training we get, but it was distressing.

‘There was a paramedic with the younger girl and I went to see if he needed help, and then I went back. I started CPR on the older lady. You’ve always got to hope and just keep trying.

‘By the time the ambulances arrived, there was a doctor, nurses, a paramedic and a fireman helping as well. The ambulance was here in less than five minutes. The  woman’s son was here as well and he was very upset. I was trying to console him as well – he was trying to get his mum to sit up. It was a horrible situation to be in.

‘The driver of the Land Rover was very distressed. There were five guys in the car and they were all very distressed.’

The 34-year-old male driver of the Land Rover was uninjured.

Miss Hucknall’s family paid  tribute to her.

In a statement, they said: ‘Abby’s family are devastated by this tragic loss. She was a very bubbly, caring and beautiful girl, a much loved daughter, sister and granddaughter who will be sorely missed by all who knew her.’

Miss MacDonald’s large family, including her other children Monty and Patricia, last night gathered to comfort each other in the family home in Kirkcaldy.

Although Mr Jones and Miss Hucknall were not married, they had been together for two years.

Miss MacDonald’s cousin, Samantha Ward, 24, said: ‘She was a lovely person, a very good mother to her three kids and just one of the  kindest, most loving people you could ever meet.

‘They were just going to Asda to buy some milk, bread and other bits and pieces for the night when this happened.

‘It’s so tragic. They were both lovely people.’

Chief superintendent Adrian Annandale, of Fife Constabulary, said: ‘We are appealing for anyone who has seen either the two women or the dark coloured Land Rover Discovery to contact us.

‘At that time of the day it’s a busy area. There are shops and other commercial premises around about.

‘There would have been a lot of people going from their work.

‘We have had some people come forward already. We would hope there are further witnesses out there.’

Wendy Logan, 41, whose son  Gordon, 10, was killed at the same spot by a speeding driver in 2004, said: ‘It brings everything rushing back.

‘In some ways it feels like yesterday and I feel devastated for these women’s families.

‘It’s beyond belief that it has happened again, in the same spot.’
