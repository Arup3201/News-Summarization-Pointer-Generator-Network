Newly released footage from a police body camera shows how a calm encounter between an Arizona officer and a domestic violence suspect quickly and unexpectedly turned deadly for the rookie cop last month. 

The nearly 14-minute video from Officer Tyler Stewart's department-issued recording device starts with Stewart in his patrol vehicle and ends with a gun pointed at him. The footage released Tuesday does not show the actual shooting.

Stewart and Robert Smith chat calmly outside Smith's Flagstaff home December 27 for about three minutes. Smith had his hands in his pockets most of the time.

Riddled with bullets: Robert Smith, 28 (left), fired six shots at Stewart (right), five of which hit the 24-year-old officer: four in the head and one in the lower back 

Killed over a trifle: Stewart, 24, was attending a domestic violence call sparked by an argument over dirty dishes 

Moments after the officer asked if he could check Smith for weapons, Smith pulled a .22-caliber revolver from his right pocket and fired six shots at Stewart, five of which hit the 24-year-old officer: four in the head and one in the lower back.

Police said Smith, 28, killed himself almost immediately with Stewart's service weapon and was pronounced dead at the scene.

The officer who had been with the Flagstaff Police Department less than a year later died at a hospital.

The video tracks what police have said all along about the shooting and highlights one of the most common calls for service in Flagstaff.

The only thing off about Smith's behavior was that he kept his right hand deep in his pocket, police Sgt. Margaret Bentzen told the Arizona Daily Sun.

Deadly lie: The first thing that Stewart asks Smith after following him outside the house is if he has any weapons in his pocket, to which the suspect replies, 'No, sir. I'm just cold'

The very first thing that Stewart asks Smith after following him outside the house is if he has any weapons in his pocket, to which the suspect replies, 'No, sir. I'm just cold.'

The video shows that before parting ways, Officer Stewart again asks Smith about the contents of his pockets. The man replies that he's carrying his 'smokes' inside his jacket.

But when Stewart tries to reach into Smith's pocket, the 28-year-old pulls out a gun and points it at the cop, who instinctively tries to shield himself with his hand.

One of Smith's roommates told police that Smith had been contemplating suicide, according to police reports. Bentzen said police have not determined a motive.

‘Officer Stewart was murdered by Smith without any provocation or warning,’ she said. ‘There were no homicidal or suicidal indications from Smith prior to the crime.’

The video was released to the media under state public records requests.

At around 1.30pm December 27, Officer Stewart pulled over in an alley near Clay Avenue after getting a call about a domestic incident.

Robert Smith's girlfriend called 911 earlier that morning claiming that the 28-year-old trashed her apartment during an argument over dirty dishes, reported AZ Central.

Stewart drove to the woman's home at around 11am, but Smith was already gone.

The officer then went to Smith's home near Clay Avenue, but his roommate said the man had fled out the back door.

Uncertain what to do, Stewart called his father, Sgt Frank Stewart, to ask him when he could enter a residence without a warrant.

Records indicate that at 12.30pm, Smith called the Flagstaff Police Department and left a message for Officer Stewart.

The rookie cop called the suspect back and less than hour later returned to his home, where he would be shot dead in cold blood. 

Other officers were called to the scene after Stewart flipped his emergency button.

However, they could not get him on the radio. The officers found Stewart critically wounded.

He was taken to Flagstaff Medical Center but later died.

'This is an enormous tragedy for our department and the family of our Officer,' local police chief Kevin Treadway told AZ Central last month.

'We are a very close knit organization, and know that all members of the Flagstaff Police Department are grieving at this time. 

Gone too soon: The 24-year-old was a graduate of Boulder Creek High School in Anthem, Arizona, and Concordia College in California

'With that being said, all of the men and women of the Flagstaff Police Department extend our prayers and condolences to the family of our Officer Tyler Stewart.'

Flagstaff mayor Jerry Nabours shared the sentiments, saying that it's 'heartbreaking to lose one of our officers. We collectively mourn for his family and the entire department'.

Stewart was a graduate of Boulder Creek High School in Anthem, Arizona, and Concordia College in California. 

Because he had been officer less than 12 months, he was still considering a rookie.
