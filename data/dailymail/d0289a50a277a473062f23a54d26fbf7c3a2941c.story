A Washington D.C. tech entrepreneur has recalled his anger at learning his former Playmate wife had died in a hot tub after a night of sex, cocaine and drinking with her lover.

Gary Hensley, 37, detailed the heart-wrenching moment he found out his wife Cassandra had died and the challenges he has faced as a single father to her two children from a previous relationship.

'I'll always miss her,' Hensley told the Washington Post.

Cassandra Lynn Hensley, who was named a Playboy Playmate of the Month in 2006, had flown from the couple's home to Los Angeles to attend Playboy's 60th anniversary party in January 2014.

But after taking part in a photo shoot, the 34-year-old headed to a photographer's apartment, had sex with him and  binged on drugs and alcohol, TMZ previously reported.

In the early hours of the next morning, the photographer woke up and found Cassandra unconscious in the bathtub. Emergency responders were unable to resuscitate her and she was pronounced dead.

Gary Hensley, who met Cassandra when they were neighbors in 2007, was home with her two children, Alexis and Devin, then 12 and six, when an acquaintance messaged him asking: 'Is it true?'

Moments later, two police officers turned up on his doorstep and explained that his wife had been found dead in Los Angeles - although they would not reveal the circumstances.

'I just had this overwhelming sense of wanting to be next to her,' he told the Washington Post's Ellen McCarthy.

But after calling the coroner, he learned the lurid details of her death. He said his reaction was anger - because he didn't know how he was going to raise the children without her.

'I was so angry at her,' he said. 'I was like, "What am I going to do? How am I going to raise the kids? How do I get Alexis through prom and her wedding and all those things you're not going to be there for?"'

Today Hensley, who has since learned that the affair had been going on for a while, is still haunted by questions of how much his wife loved him.

'A year past all that, I just have come to the resolve that for the five years we were together, she did - to the degree that she could,' he told the Post. 'And nobody's perfect. Neither am I.'

He knew Cassandra had struggled with drugs and alcohol when she was younger and, in the months before her death, he noticed that she had started drinking again.

Hensley, who launched a tech start-up that was later acquired by Pearson Education, said his job's uncertainty, problems in her own career and their move to Washington D.C., where Cassandra was judged for her past, had been tough on her.

Cassandra, who worked as an event hostess before her death, started drinking again, including the night before she flew to California. They didn't talk that night, Hensley said, but she texted him after heading to the airport to say that she loved him.

After her death, he eventually returned to their home with the children, whom he had been raising as his own. Their biological father had not wanted custody, the Post reported.

'It was a very quiet, very lonely, very clean house,' he said. 'Nights were particularly hard.'

He took time from work and tried to bring some normalcy to the children's lives, figuring out how to talk to them about the tragedy, and getting through the days with the help of family and friends.

He said they've now 'got it down' and the children both call him 'Dad'.

'It always makes me smile,' he said.
