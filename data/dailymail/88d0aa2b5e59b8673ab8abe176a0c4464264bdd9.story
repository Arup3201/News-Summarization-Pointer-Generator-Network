In his characteristically blas√© fashion, designer Tom Ford, 52, has announced his marriage to long time partner Richard Buckley, 66.

'We are married now, which is nice,' he simply said.

The news came yesterday during a conversation with British journalist, Lady Kinvara Balfour, at London's Regent Street Apple store, during which he flashed a gold wedding ring to the audience.

Wedding Bells: Tom Ford, 52, has announced his secret nuptials to former Vogue Hommes editor Richard Buckley, 66

'I know that was just made legal in the UK, which is great. We were married in the States,' he explained, giving no further details as to the where and when.

Mr Ford went on to explain: 'I lost so many friends in college - I would say more than half of my closest friends. Richard, my partner of 27 years, had also gone through something also quite tough in his life.'

The couple, who welcomed son Alexander, their first 
child together, into the world in September 2012, met at a fashion show in 1986 and Tom 
Ford has spoken openly of his instant attraction to the former Vogue 
Hommes editor.

'I went to a fashion show and this silver-haired guy was staring at me with these piercing water-blue eyes,' he told WWD. 'It scared me because I absolutely saw and knew my entire future.'

The Texan-born designer, who was only 25 at the time, told Out magazine in 2011 that it was 'love at first sight' and that he decided he would marry Mr Buckley, then 38, 'in the length of an elevator ride,' following their whirlwind first few encounters.

'You can look at someone and feel 
like you've known them forever,' he gushed. 'The first night I ever had 
drinks with Richard, I felt I knew everything about him.'

For his part, Mr Buckley said: 'I couldn't imagine being without Tom now. I couldn't imagine what I'd be like if something happened to him. There's only one Tom for me.'

Somewhat surprisingly, Mr Ford also admitted that when the power couple first met, he was 'pathologically shy' and his new husband, who was the editor in chief of Vogue Hommes International at the time, was 'very, very social and very talkative.'

'Richard is an extrovert, and I'm an introvert, but meeting us today you would think the opposite,' Mr Ford explained.

The couple started dating during the late Eighties, a time when AIDS was prevalent, particularly in the gay community, and tragically, both lost an estimated half on their friends to the disease.

Mr Ford, who says the pair enjoyed three dates before having sex, has admitted that this 'enormous fear' affected their 'early sexual relationship.'

Further tragedy hit when, just three 
years after they moved in together (Mr Ford surprised his boyfriend with
 a small Tiffany box containing a key to his apartment) Mr Buckley was 
diagnosed with throat cancer.

Despite being told it could be fatal, he pulled through and their luck changed for the better. The couple were overjoyed to announce the birth of their son in 2012 - believed to have been born via a surrogate.

Speaking candidly to British GQ last year about their new found parenthood, Mr Ford said: 'I used to spend most of my time at home naked, but now we have a child it means we have a nanny and so I can't come downstairs naked and have a bowl of cereal in the morning.'

And while we can only imagine how stylish and touching the nuptials must have been, Mr Ford has so far remained tight-lipped on any details of their big day.
