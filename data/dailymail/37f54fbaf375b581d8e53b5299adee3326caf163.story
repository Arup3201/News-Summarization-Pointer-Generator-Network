Revolting plot: Rose Mary Vogel, 55, of Sun Lakes, 
Arizona, has been charged with first-degree attempted murder for 
allegedly injecting fecal matter into her hospitalized husband's IV line

Police in Arizona have released the 911 call that led to the arrest of a 55-year-old woman suspected of trying to kill her hospitalized ex-cop husband by injecting feces matter into his IV line.

The call came last Friday afternoon from the Chandler Regional Medical Center's head of security.

Hospital staff said they found Rose Mary Vogel tampering with the IV line and saw a brown substance blocking the tube attached to the body of the woman’s husband, 66-year-old Philip Vogel, a retired police officer from Lexington, Kentucky.

When it was searched in the hospital, Vogel's purse contained a total of three syringes, including two with a clear liquid, police said.

Police documents said Vogel is a retired registered nurse who formerly worked at the Chandler hospital.

On the 911 call released Monday, the hospital security chief sounds almost embarrassed describing the incident.

‘We have a situation here where… how do I explain this…’ he begins to explain, MyFox Phoenix reported.

The security supervisor goes on to say that staff didn't see Vogel inject the fecal matter into the IV line, but she was the only person in the room when the tampering occurred.

‘She was in the room, and she's a former nurse and she was playing with the IV pump and everything else,’ the unidentified man says. 

Victim: Vogel's husband has been identified as 66-year-old Philip Vogel, a 22-year veteran of the Lexington Police Department who retired in 1995 after shooting dead a young black suspect

He then adds: ‘It's a substance that you can't get unless you inject it into there. Somebody has done that.’

Police said a hospital laboratory test identified the substance as fecal matter, and a trace amount of a brown substance also was found in the needle of an otherwise empty syringe found in Vogel's purse.

Vogel, of Sun Lakes, is being held on suspicion of attempted first-degree murder and vulnerable adult abuse.

Police don't have a possible motive yet. Vogel declined to be interviewed by police and asked for an attorney after her arrest.

The incident occurred after Mr Vogel had undergone a heart procedure. Police said Monday that he remains hospitalized, but his condition wasn't immediately released.

Philip Vogel had served on the police force in Lexington for 22 years until 1995, when he retired after the controversial shooting of a young black man, Lexington Herald Leader reported.

In October 1994, then-Sgt Vogel and other officers were trying to arrest 18-year-old Tony Sullivan on felony warrants when the veteran cop shot the suspect in the head.

Vogel later explained that his service weapon discharged accidentally. A grand jury decided not to indict him. 

After
 leaving the police department, Vogel got a master's degree in criminal 
justice education and moved to sun Lakes, Arizona, with his wife, Rose 
Mary.

The couple have been married for more than 30 years, and their stunned neighbors in Sun Lakes say the two seemed very happy.   

Caught in the act: Nurses at Chandler Regional Medical Center, where Vogel used to work, found the woman manipulating her husband's IV

‘This
 was not your typical Rose Mary. It was like another person or a demon 
got a hold of her or she snapped,’ neighbor Mary Lola Reese told the 
station KCTV5.

Philip Vogel is expected to survive the procedure on his heart, as well as the alleged attempt on his life.

According to a police report, Mrs Vogel was sitting with her husband in a Chandler Regional Medical Center recovery room at around 1.30pm Thursday following a surgery on his heart.

A pair of nurses walked into the room and noticed the wife in the act of handling her husband's IV line, which caused an alarm to go off. 

Herself a registered nurse, Rose Mary Vogel told her former colleagues that the IV line needed to be flushed.

That is when another hospital staffer discovered a brown substance in the medical equipment and removed the line from the patient’s arm, noting that the IV smelled like feces, the station WFSB reported.

The nurse went for help, and upon her return she found the 65-yar-old wife trying to empty the contaminated IV bag into the trash, only to have one of the hospital personnel snatch it out of her hands, according to the report. 

The suspect initially had faced a charge of aggravated assault, which was later upgraded to first-degree attempted murder.

Rose Mary Vogel is being held on $100,000 bond in the Maricopa county Jail.
