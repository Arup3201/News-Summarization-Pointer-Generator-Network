Mr Hofman, from California, USA, said: 'This is the most amazing wildlife encounter on the planet. 'It's impossible not to smile and laugh at these incredible whales.

'There are lots of grey whales that are friendly and seek out contact, not just one individual.'

He added: 'It's a very powerful experience when a whale is looking into you. 

'The number one comment I hear afterwards, besides that they feel so weird and rubbery, is that people say the whale looked right at them.

'People walk away fundamentally changed after an experience like this.'

Grey whales migrate more than 5,000 miles from their summer feeding grounds in the Bering and Okhotsk seas of the Arctic.

They use the relatively warm waters off Mexico to give birth, mate and nurse their newborns.

The naturally curious species has made a dramatic recovery since it was nearly hunted to extinction in the early part of the 20th century.
