Nothing comes between a sea lion and their fish.

A group of tourists enjoying a lovely boat ride in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, got a rather delightful surprise when a sea lion began chasing down the boat, this as they were travelling 25mph in the Pacific Ocean. 

Things got even crazier however when one of the skippers on the boat opened the back of the vessel, and the sea lion hopped on-board.

Scroll down for video 

The chase is on: A sea lion began following a boat going 25mph in Cab San Lucas, Mexico

Open the hatch: The skipper opened up the back of the boat after he noticed the lion keeping up with the boat

Welcome aboard: The lion then hopped on-board and joined the delighted tourists

It seems this was not a social call for the sea lion however, as he was instead after one of the large fishes on the boat.

And so he got a nice big catch from the skipper, and then headed back into the ocean.

Feed me: It was not a social call however, as the sea lion was actually looking for some of the fish he saw on the boat

Getting it in: The lion looks delighted after being tossed a fish 

Bidding farewell: Having been fed and no doubt exhausted from following the boat, the lion leaves to go eat

It is not certain if this sea lion is the infamous Pepe, known for chasing boats around and snatching fishes, but no mater who it is, they are very well fed right now. 

Pepe meanwhile did strike recently, being captured on video as he snuck up on two fisherman proudly showing off their catches and snatched one right out of a man's hands.
