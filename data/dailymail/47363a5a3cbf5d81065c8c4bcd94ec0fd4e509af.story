Police in Connecticut are on the hunt for a brazen wedding crasher who they say pilfered gifts from the bride and groom while posing as a guest at the reception.

The suspect, a white male in his mid-20s or 30s, fled the Inn at Longshore in Westport Saturday night with a silver birdcage filled with wedding cards, many apparently containing cash for the newlyweds.

Police used K-9 dogs to try to track the man, but they only recovered the empty birdcage.

Wedding crasher: This unidentified man posed as a guest at a wedding  in Connecticut to steal a birdcage filled with gift cards intended for the newlywed couple 

On the run: The thief was caught on camera bolting out of the wedding venue with the gift box in his hands

Party spoiled: The heist took place at the Inn at Longshore, a reception hall and bed and breakfast situated on a golf course in Westport, Connecticut

Unwelcome guest: Police say the thief posed as either a guest at the wedding celebration or at the hotel 

The uninvited guest was caught on surveillance camera at the venue, which captured him talking on his cellphone before bolting out of the building with birdcage in hand.

Investigators have released screen grabs in the hope somebody might recognize him, NBC New York reported. 

Police were called the upscale wedding venue and golf course at 260 Compo Road South in Westport at around 7pm Saturday after getting reports of a robbery.

An investigation has revealed that the thief was posing as either a guest at the reception or the bed and breakfast.

Cameras in the lobby captured the moment the suspect fled the hotel with the silver gift box, nearly knocking over a couch in the process.

Norwalk police officer Rich Montanez and his K-9 partner, Kai, searched the perimeter of the venue and found the discarded empty birdcage about 300 yards from the reception hall, according to The Hour.

Wanted: The suspect was described as a man in his mid-20s or 30s, clean shaven with close-cropped light-brown hair

‘I haven't seen anything like this happen,’ Westport Lt. Ryan Paulsson told the station WFSB. ‘I think it says a lot about the world that we live in.’

The newlyweds whose special day was marred by the theft have since left on their honeymoon, and police are hoping to have some good news for them by the time they return home.

The perpetrator was described as a man between 25 and 35 years old, clean shaven, with close-cropped light brown hair. He was last seen wearing grey slacks and a white button-down shirt with a white undershirt.

Anyone with information on his whereabouts is being asked to call the Westoport Police Department at 203-2341-6000.
