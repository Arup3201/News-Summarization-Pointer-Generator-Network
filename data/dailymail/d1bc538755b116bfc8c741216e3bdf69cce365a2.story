John Watson competed in 152 Formula One races over 10 years. He won five times, including the 1981 British Grand Prix for McLaren, and scored 169 career points. After leaving the sport in 1985, Watson has forged a successful media career, and today he writes for MailOnline.

Following the fall-out from the Monaco Grand Prix, Watson assesses the fractious relationship beetween Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, and asks whether Mercedes could have handled the situation in a better fashion.

If you go back to qualifying, I can understand why Lewis Hamilton was upset because he did not do anything wrong and he got caught up in Nico Rosberg’s incident which, in my opinion, was not pre-meditated. That said, it did work advantageously for Rosberg.

I had an incident for McLaren at the 1980 Monaco Grand Prix where I didn’t qualify for the race and I was overly negative about everything. From then I learned that all you can do is put what has happened behind you. You cannot change it, so there is no point carrying the grudge forward.

If Hamilton wanted to believe Rosberg’s accident was pre-meditated then there is nothing anyone could have said to him to change his mind. But nonetheless, it is history and you can’t do anything about it.

Frosty: Lewis Hamilton's attitude after Nico Rosberg's 'error' in qualifying reflected badly and didn't help him

Controversial: Rosberg was forced to take to the escape road on his final run in Saturday's qualifying session

It reflected badly on him that he retained the grudge, taking it right through to Saturday evening, then the race, the podium, and, I gather, later on when the pair of them were out that evening socialising.

Both Hamilton and Rosberg are playing mind games, and on this occasion Rosberg won the battle, and he won the grand prix, too. Hamilton was irked about the pit-stops, but that is what happens during a safety car period. It is almost as if he has got a conspiracy theory going on in his head that he was being conspired against by his own team, which is not the case, but to be honest they are both acting like a couple of pre-pubescent girls in the playground.

Formula One has always needed a ruck of this nature going on in a team. You had it with Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, and you had it with Niki Lauda and James Hunt, although they were at rival teams, but it doesn’t do the sport any harm.

The trouble comes with the fact that Formula One is potentially a dangerous sport, but both drivers behaved in the correct manner on Sunday and had the right wisdom and insight to leave their handbags off the circuit.

There was a foundation of truth in Hamilton’s comments before the race that he is hungrier than Rosberg because of their differing backgrounds, but lest us not forget that Hamilton got picked up by McLaren when he was 12, and all his motor-racing from that point forward was paid for by Mercedes and McLaren and Ron Dennis.

But while he may have grown up in Stevenage he is not a child anymore, he is a man.

Differing moods: Nico Rosberg puts his thumbs up while Lewis Hamilton storms off after Monaco qualifying

It is phenomenal what he has achieved in F1 and he has achieved it from the determination, in part of his start in life, but he has to move on.

Both Hamilton and Rosberg have grown up in a gilded world which is as real as fantasy is. They are not emotionally equipped or developed to know how to deal with this battle, and I don’t believe there is anyone of the quality of Ross Brawn at Mercedes who has that ability either.

Indeed, if Brawn had been running the team, as he had been up until last year, the situation between the two drivers would have been handled a lot better.

What you have got now at Mercedes is a very different management structure based on a different platform with different managers all at a similar level. Then you have got Niki Lauda acting as ‘the Godfather’.

Lauda is on record as saying Hamilton was ‘unbeatable’ after winning in China, Bahrain and Spain, and I have no doubt that there will have been an element of “what about me?” from Rosberg. In Spain, his body language was not positive. I noticed that when they were doing the group photograph, they all gave a big cheer, but Rosberg didn’t.

Tough day: Hamilton complained about getting dirt in his eye... it was a disappointing weekend

Pressure: Mercedes director Toto Wolff must try and control the duo

Unconciusly, the team gravitates towards the the driver who is getting the job done, and ahead of the race in Monaco that would have been Hamilton. So, Rosberg will have begun to feel that he was getting subjugated out of the picture because everything was focused on Hamilton - the Briton having won four races on the spin.

Also, in Spain, it turned out that Hamilton had used a power boost button, which is saved for qualifying principally, during the race to defend his position against Rosberg who was catching him up. He shouldn’t have done that, and suddenly, all those resentments from Rosberg build into big issues.

Niki said he will ‘sort it out’, and he is a very pragmatic man, but in a sense he is part of the problem because has been ‘bigging up’ Hamilton.

I don’t see anyone at Mercedes with the authority, the credibility and the gravitas that Brawn had. If you think back to last year’s Malaysian Grand Prix, Rosberg wanted to catch and pass Hamilton, and Brawn emphatically said: “No. Hold position.” It is not just what you say, it is the way you say it and it is the person who says it. Rosberg thought about it, but then obeyed the command.

Conflict: Mercedes team boss Niki Lauda may have upset Rosberg by saying Hamilton was 'unbeatable'

Is Toto Wolff more interested in talking to the press and projecting himself? Does he really have the authority? And what of Paddy Lowe? He is a fantastic guy, but he is not the person to deal with this feud. Lauda is a very clever man, but I don’t know what authority he has either. At the end of the day, if there was one person who could kick ass in that team, it is the person that they let go.

Formula One isn’t like golf, tennis, boxing or any other individual sport. You are playing for a team, and there are responsibilities that come with that. It goes back to having someone on the pit-wall with authority that everybody in the team - drivers, engineers, whoever - actually respect.

And at the minute there is nobody I see at Mercedes who has that level of respect within that management structure that Ross Brawn would have carried.
