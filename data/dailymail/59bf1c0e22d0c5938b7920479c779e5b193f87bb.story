New statistics reveal that an astonishing number of individuals in the United States are infected with sexually transmitted diseases.

According to the Center for Disease Control, there are a total of 110 million STDs among the men and women of America, with 20 million new cases being reported every year.

The direct medical cost of these infections is said to be $16 billion.

Scary stats: 110 million cases of sexually transmitted diseases have been reported in the United States, with chlamydia, as seen in the chart above, being one of the most common

Growing numbers: Each year, 20 million news cases of STDs, including syphilis (above), are reported

Perhaps most frightening however is the fact that 50% of new infections occur in individuals between the ages of 15 and 24. 

This all comes at a time when many in the country are terrified of the threat of Ebola, an infectious disease that has so far been found in just one individual currently in the United States.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common, accounting for almost 80 million existing infections and just over 14 million new ones each year.

The four other most common existing infections are, in order, genital herpes, trichomoniasis, chlamydia and HIV according to numbers being reported on Live Science.

Chlamydia is the second highest in terms of new infections ever year, and also one of the hardest to measure as many who are infected are unaware as they don't show any symptoms. 

HIV meanwhile seems to be slowly decreasing when compared to other STDs, with only 40,000 new cases being reported every year. 

About 50.5 million current infections are in men while 59.5 million are in women.
