The residents of a well-heeled town in Greater Manchester perform more internet searches for payday loans than those living anywhere else.

Information released by Google shows that the most search requests came from the predominantly middle-class area of Altrincham.

Local economics expert Pete Wild was not surprised by the results, however.

The senior lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University’s finance department said the urge to ‘keep up with the Joneses’ encouraged people to seek out payday loans.

‘People who have a nice lifestyle are less likely to want to give it up,’ he said, suggesting that residents who should be tightening their belts in tough financial times ‘are making bad credit decisions in order to keep having two holidays a year when really they should be having one.'

'People will move heaven and earth to keep their children in private schools when they cannot really afford it.

'When you go through Altrincham and Hale now you can see the number 
of boarded-up shops. The area just doesn’t have the money to drive 
consumerism at the moment.'

He added: ‘Getting a payday loan is so much easier and less embarrassing than having to grovel at the bank you have been at for 12 years for a little extra money.’

'But the second you get one your credit rating drops down to one [the 
lowest rating].

Google's data showed Altrincham was the biggest hotspot for the search terms 'payday loans' and 'Wonga.com'. It was followed by Halesowen in Birmingham. Pictured: Puppets from a Wonga TV advert

'A landlord would not want to take you, some jobs, 
especially in the financial sector will not be available to you. They 
show a lack of control, a lack of planning and that you are likely to 
splurge.

'People don’t see all this when they get the loans but as accountants we do see all that, and it’s depressing.'
