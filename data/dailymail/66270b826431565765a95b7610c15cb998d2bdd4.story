I really hope history shows that all the criticism England, and especially Stuart Lancaster, have faced over the past two weeks turns out to be a blessing in disguise. Every successful coach understands that no team progresses in straight lines. There are always tough lessons along the way.

You don’t become a bad team overnight and England still have every ounce of potential they took into the autumn series. What is important now is how they respond.

At times of success a head coach needs to look out of the window and praise those who have contributed. At times like this, you have to look in the mirror. It is important not to overreact, but after five losses on the bounce there needs to be some soul-searching.

It was a similar story against world champions New Zealand with England similarly outclassed

England have had a very loud wake-up call. They are a long way behind New Zealand and South Africa and possibly Australia — and it’s worth remembering those three teams are at the end of their season and will be fresher in mind and body in 10 months when the World Cup comes around. England got away with two narrow defeats that could have been a lot worse.

England have been criticised not just because they have been losing but for the way they are playing, especially behind the pack. The autumn series started with 20 minutes of fast, expansive rugby which pinned the All Blacks behind their 22-metre line and Jonny May produced one of the finest tries scored at Twickenham. Since then it has been stop-start, lacking clear attacking purpose and strategy.

I have always advocated two playmakers at 10 and 12 and I’m excited that Lancaster has belatedly opted to use that combination  with George Ford playing alongside Owen Farrell.

I really hope Farrell goes well because this two ball-players concept is a lesson England and their fans need to understand if they want to be the best team on the planet, which must always be the goal. Farrell is top quality and his presence at 12 should add a different dimension to England’s attacking play.

Ford (left) and Farrell go back years and their experience of playing together should be fruitful for England

Ford needs to play flat to the gainline and commit Samoa’s aggressive defence in tandem with Farrell in the way the great Australian partnership of Mark and Gary Ella operated in the 1980s.

Farrell has been an easy target this week but suggestions he gets preferential treatment because his father is on the coaching staff are so wrong. Farrell alone is not to blame for a misfiring backline. He will know he could have lost his place but this kid is tough, and I’d back him to embrace the change.

Moving from 10 to 12 doesn’t let him off the hook. He must go for broke: at 12 he is Ford’s eyes and the linchpin of the backline. If he continues to play deep, Ford will be exposed.

Together, they need to move the Samoan defence around by putting width on the ball and bringing May and Anthony Watson into the game. They need to split England’s attack and create space for others.

Lancaster’s bold move should make England more creative. Great sides down the years always had playmakers at inside centre — Australia’s Matt Giteau is probably the best around. 

I would have selected Danny Cipriani at 10 alongside Farrell for his pace, range of passing and experience. Don’t get me wrong, Ford is an excellent prospect but I’m surprised Cipriani keeps getting overlooked. Exeter’s Henry Slade is another option at inside centre. A gifted playmaker with pace, he might get his chance before the World Cup.

I fear we lack real speed at outside centre. Brad Barritt never lets the side down but by picking two ball-players at 10 and 12 you need out-and-out gas at 13 as well as at full back and on the wings. Without this speed at 13, our potency could be limited. I call it a back four and I’d have preferred to have seen Luther Burrell or Jonathan Joseph selected as both players would give the side more pace than Barritt.

If England stick with this 10-12 combination, they need an outside centre with searing pace. Manu Tuilagi has pace, but not searing pace, and if he’s not available then England look short of options

England need to move on from the last two defeats. This is a positive-looking team and I’m eager to see what James Haskell will add to the back row. I liked what I heard from him this week when he spoke about no-one remembering how good England’s culture is if they keep losing. He’s right.

I like the individuality and personality Haskell brings. England’s players should not be afraid to make mistakes. They should be free to express themselves and excite the crowd. They need to mix it up.

Samoa’s biggest threat is their unpredictability. They gave us a real fright in the group stages in 2003. One thing is certain, England will face some great athletes with enormous physicality. Discipline could be their downfall and I wouldn’t be surprised to see a couple sinbinned.

Their build-up will have been affected by all the talk of going on strike. I have some sympathy on that front. I was in charge in 2000 when Martin Johnson and the players threatened to boycott the game against Argentina. It was an awful experience but when the dust settled I was actually very proud of the leadership Johnno and the players showed under difficult circumstances.

It takes courage to challenge the authorities and while Samoa will have been disrupted, they will now have an even clearer understanding of what it means to pull on a Samoan jersey.

I can’t see how England can lose this game, so let’s hope Ford and Farrell unpick Samoa’s defence and we get the sort of rugby we all want to see.
