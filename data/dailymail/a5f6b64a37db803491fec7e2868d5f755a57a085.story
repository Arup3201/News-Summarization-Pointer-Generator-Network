Rio Ferdinand has recalled how Sir Alex Ferguson would hammer Cristiano Ronaldo and other of Manchester United’s main men to get the best out of them, and claims he’s never seen an England manager do the same.

In an explosive autobiography - #2Sides - serialised in The Sun, Ferdinand insists Ferguson was a genius and took him for granted before his retirement last year.

Ferdinand, who moved to QPR after departing United last summer, remembers one game against Benfica in 2006 where Ronaldo tried too much, and got the hairdryer treatment from the United boss.

He said: ‘‘I remember Ronaldo getting emotional one game when we played Benfica in Lisbon. He thought he had to prove to people in Portugal why he moved to United.

‘The game became the Ronaldo show, he was trying to show his skills and nothing was coming off.

‘We lost and afterwards the manager absolutely destroyed him. “Who the hell do you think you are”.

‘I never saw England managers hammering David Beckham like that, or Stevie Gerrard or Frank Lampard or Wayne Rooney.’

Ferdinand, signed by Ferguson in 2002 from Leeds for a British record fee, said the Scot’s ways brought the best out of him and kept his standards high.

He added: ‘It made me think, I could be next. I better stay on my toes. We took Fergie for granted, but now I see he was a genius.

‘He would finish most of his team talk with: “Now go out and enjoy yourself”. It was never do this, do that, because that can take away a player’s flair.’
