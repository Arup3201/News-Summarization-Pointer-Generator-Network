A giant aircraft hangar which once held the world's largest flying boat and was used to film Independence Day and Transformers could soon be transformed into Google's latest offices.

The former Howard Hughes Aircraft space is just north of Los Angeles International Airport, and is twice the length for a football pitch and seven stories high.

It was where the 'Spruce Goose' was built - the largest ever flying boat and aircraft with the biggest wingspan in history - in the 1940s.

Google is interested in taking on the hangar, the Wall Street Journal reports, and are currently in early discussions with the owners - real estate developer Ratkovich Co. 

The rest of the former Hughes Aircraft headquarters has already been converted, with companies such as YouTube - who are owned by Google, already based there.

And the technology giant hopes to join them, by renting almost all of the whopping 300,000 square foot (nearly 28,000 square metre) space.

Howard Hughes' company built the hanger in 1943, and sold the airfield in the 1980s to make room for development. Ratkovich Co. bought it in 2010.

Although refusing to comment on Google, chief executive Wayne Ratkovich told the Wall Street Journal that renting out the property 'was faster than we imagined, faster than we expected'.

Google already has offices in California, including one in Venice which looks like a huge pair of binoculars from the front.

The 750ft (230 metre) long property, called Building 15, is in Los Angeles' Playa Vista neighbourhood out of town.

It has drawn a number of technology, advertising and media oriented companies in the last few years, and Ratkovich has had to cater for them as a result.

Surfboard racks and barbecue pits have been installed, while food vans also come to the suburb. 

Despite being the set for scenes in hit sci-fi films, Building 15 is perhaps best known as home of the Spruce Goose.

The huge heavy transport aircraft was built for transatlantic transport during World War II, but was not completed in time to be used. It made just one flight - on November 2, 1947. 

It got its name as it was made from wood - thanks to restrictions on use of aluminium during the war - but was actually built largely from birch rather than spruce.

The London offices also have a ping-pong table and table football to help staff relax during shifts

It now sits in the Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon, where it remains in good condition.

The machine was designed and built by the aircraft company of Howard Hughes - an American business tycoon of the time who was also behind hit films such as Scarface.

He was an eccentric who became a recluse in later life, before dying on board a plane, his body withered down to a tiny 41kg in weight, he was almost unrecognisable.

He was played by Leonardo Di Caprio in 2004 film The Aviator, which won five Academy Awards. 

Google's current U.S. HQ is in Silicone Valley, California, and is said to feature a vegetable garden
