When journalists saw first lady Michelle Obama on Sunday during her visit to the Great Wall of China, the few photographers permitted to see the event were forbidden to shoot from an angle that would have produced an unfortunate photo, framing her and her family with a decades-old rock sculpture that reads 'loyal to Chairman Mao.'

Instead, photojournalists were forced to remain on a Wall tower between Mrs. Obama and the 1,300-foot-wide carving, making that photo impossible to take.

'Photographers and reporters covering the visit were sent ahead to Tower 15' on the Wall, according to a pool report, 'and told they could not move from the top of the tower until told to do so.'

On a hillside near the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall of China, a carved stone inscription (top) reads 'loyal to Chairman Mao.' During the first lady's visit, photographers were kept away from a vantage point that would have allowed them to capture the Obamas in a photo like this

Mrs. Obama (L) walked with her daughters Malia (R) and Sasha (C) on the Great Wall at Mutianyu, but the only photographers on the scene were forced to stay between the Obamas and the communist loyalty message

The stones, stacked by Red Guards in the late 1960s, were covered with brush until 2008, when the government cleared the vegetation and repainted them in time for the 2008 Summer Olympics

'Because of where we were positioned,' the pool journalist wrote, 'they could only be photographed with scenery to the south of Tower 15. Had photographers been able to shoot from Tower 14 as the family walked north, the photographs would have captured them walking the wall with a massive rock inscription on the hillside above them to the north, which read in Chinese characters, "Loyal to Chairman Mao."'

This reporter visited the same section of the Great Wall in the summer of 2009, and photographed the rock inscription. A tour guide who visits the Great Wall at least once each week said at the time that Red Guards had built the inscription out of quarried stone in the late 1960s and painted them white with lime.

But in the 40 years that followed, the paint wore away and brush grew to cover the rocks.

Just months before the 2008 Summer Olympics, Chinese government officials ordered a refurbishment of the site. Vegetation was removed and the rocks were repainted.

Reached for comment, the tour guide told MailOnline that she was on the same section of the Wall on Saturday, the day before the Obamas arrived.

'I had a client and we went up on the Mutianyu section,' she said, 'and one of the gondola operators told me he had been instructed to make sure the first lady's family wasn't traveling up to the top until the security guards told him everything was all set' – likely meaning that the press was situated in their prescribed place. 

Forbidden: T-shirts like this were yanked from sale in peddlers' stalls near the Great Wall when the Obamas came to visit

Carefully scripted: The first lady's visit to the Great Wall was choreographed by U.S. and Chinese security forces, with order maintained by local government police

Watchful eye: Access to the Mutianyu section of the Wall was controlled by security forces while the Obamas were there

Secret Service agents, including some Asian-Americans, watched closely as Michelle Obama and her daughters walked with a group of pre-screened tourists. (Can you spot them?)

'This happens when important people visit. We don't want to take to them to the Badaling section of the Wall because it is too crowded. They can't shoo everyone away, and they also can't protect the dignitaries,' she added. 'It's difficult.'

The all-seeing eyes: Secret Service were carefully positioned in front of the Obamas and behind them at every step

'But [the] Mutianyu [section], you know, has the Mao rock carving. So that becomes difficult as well, especially for Westerners. I'm sure the photographers were forbidden from taking an embarrassing picture.'

News outlets had a field day on Sunday with a dispatch from the same pool reporter that noted how vendors near the Wall at Mutianyu were instructed to hide popular t-shirts merging President Barack Obama and People's Republic of China founder Mao Zedong.

Mrs. Obama's hotel stay in Beijing was also marked by controversy, with a well-placed staffer at the Westin Chaoyang telling MailOnline that her mother had been 'barking at the staff since she arrived.'

The careful scripting of the first lady's China trip stands in stark contrast with a statement she made to the Chinese news outlet Caixin Online before the journey began.

'We get plenty of questioning and criticism from our media and our fellow citizens – but we wouldn't trade it for anything in the world,' she said.'

Mrs. Obama hasn't taken any questions from journalists since she landed in China.
