A woman's stowaway Chihuahua was discovered by airport employees before it could depart New York with its owner.

The traveler 'had no idea the pup had crawled into a suitcase until TSA officers detected the dog inside the woman's luggage' according to the Transport Security Administration's Lisa Farbstein.

The beige and brown dog would have flown from La Guardia Airport to a layover in Chicago before arriving at its owner's final destination of Los Angeles on Tuesday, according to the Queens Courier.

However, the checked, hard-shell case set off the TSA alarm, and employees found the woman before she boarder her flight.

Ms Farbstein said that owner was 'shocked' that her covert canine had decided to join her on the West Coast.

Her husband came to the airport and picked up the Chihuahua.

It is not known whether the woman made her flight. 

Social media users reacted on Twitter by calling the dog 'the most adorable stowaway' but also expressing concern that the animal could have suffocated if not found before being put in the baggage hold.
