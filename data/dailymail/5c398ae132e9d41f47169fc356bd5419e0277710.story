For once, there was no hyperbole in the estate agents' blurb.

'A bit shabby' and 'no architectural merit' were among their unvarnished opinions of the bricks and mortar.

But this run-down house in desperate need of repair has sold for nearly £3.5 million to set a record for the millionaires' resort of Sandbanks.

Is the dream over? This run-down house in the millionaire's resort of Sandbanks sold for nearly £3.5 million. The owners hoped to bulldoze it and build their dream home

The price paid for the shabby home on
 the sandy peninsular in Poole, Dorset, equates to £1,725 per square 
foot, well above the existing record of £1,364.

It has sold for £3.45 million, which is more than a 400 per cent rise on the last time it was sold in 1998 for £665,000.

With four bedrooms, two bathrooms, three reception areas and two balconies, on paper the house looks to have a lot going for it.

But the unnamed couple who have bought it aren't interested in the actual building, which they plan to demolish, it is the precious plot of land it sits on.

It enjoys one of the best locations on Sandbanks, boasting two-way views of picturesque Poole Harbour from the front and the sea to the rear.

A shortage of property, and views like this, have made Sandbanks the fifth most expensive location in the world to buy property

Despite its sale price of £3.45 million and the potential cost to rebuild, estate agents have described the deal as a 'sensible price'.

Adrian Dunford, of estate agents Tailor Made which sold the detached house, said: 'The property was built in the 1950s, is in need of complete repair and has no architectural merit.

'But its location is considered an extremely rare opportunity given it affords a two-way view of both Sandbanks Beach and Poole Harbour.

"The internal living area is about 2,000 square feet and the price for it is a new record high for Sandbanks of 1,725 per square foot.

'The previous record was for a penthouse apartment that achieved 1,364 per sq ft in 2008. It is one of the last two-way plots that you can do something with for a sensible price.

'The couple who have bought it plan to have it as their main home. There is an option to refurbish it but it is likely that they will try and remove it and start again.

'Judging by the properties either side of it, it shouldn't be a problem to go up one more storey and a new house there could easily be worth five to six million pounds.'

Although the existing 1950s house has no back garden to speak of, it does have direct access to the sandy beach.

The property is one of the last of its type on the exclusive spot that has yet to be bought up and developed.

Round two: The couple intend to submit a revised plan in the near future

It is thought the new owners could spend up to £1 million building a modern, three-storey family home in its place.

Sandbanks is rated as the fifth most expensive location in the world to buy property, with only Manhattan, Tokyo, Hong Kong and London ahead of it.

Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp has a mansion home there and former Oasis singer Liam Gallagher and wife Nicole Appleton have holidayed there before.

Recently its wealthy residents were in the news over a story they were planning to boycott a Tesco store which is set to open in the neighbourhood.

Aghast residents said the store would look 'like a filling in a set of teeth' and thought a Waitrose or Marks and Spencer would be more suited to the affluent area.
