The brother of the $1m lottery winner who was poisoned with cyanide the day after he got his winning check was the one who got the case re-opened, MailOnline can reveal.

ImTiaz Khan called up the Cook County Medical Examiner in Chicago because he thought ‘something wasn’t right’ with the unexpected death of Urooj Khan, 46.

ImTiaz was concerned because he learnt Urooj had coughed up blood as he died which was not consistent with the original ruling that heart disease was the cause of death.

Not right: The brother of Urooj Khan called police demanding they re-open the investigation into the death. His call prompting the discovery he died of cyanide poisoning at the home he shared with wife, Shabana Ansari

MailOnline can also reveal that now Urooj’s demise is a being treated as a homicide, the Khan family are living in fear the poisoner may strike again.

One relative, who refused to give his name for fear of retaliation, said that ‘anything is possible’ -  and that he fears his own children might become a target too by 'enemies that I don't know exist'.

Urooj  died on July 20 last year the day after he collected the oversized check from Illinois State Lottery officials at the 7-Eleven near his Chicago home where he bought the winning scratchcard.

After taxes, the prize money amounted to $425,000 as he took it in a lump sum.

The initial toxicology report did not show up cyanide so the death was ruled as by natural causes. It was only when ImTiaz intervened that the poison was found by further tests.

Urooj’s body is now set to be exhumed to conduct further analysis to find out if he ingested or inhaled the fatal dose. 

No arrests have been made so far and Urooj’s wife Shabana Ansari, 32, has denied having anything to do with his death.

Ansari told MailOnline ‘certainly not’, when asked on Thursday if she was responsible for the death of Urooj Khan. 'It's tough without him, it's really tough because he was my support and he was my courage and he was my strength,' she said.

MailOnline has also revealed a Chicago police source has claimed that she did not share his last dinner, the traditional Indian Kofta curry she prepared at their home in Chicago.

Urooj's daughter from a previous marriage, Jasmeen, 17, who lived at the property, did not eat the curry either. Also living at the address was Shabana's father, Fareedun Ansari. 

It has emerged he owed $124,000 in unpaid taxes that led to the IRS had taken out a lien on the property they were all sharing.

Speaking to MailOnline the relative paid tribute to Urooj, a workaholic who ran three laundries in Chicago, as a ‘great guy, a loving caring man’.

The ex-wife of the poisoned $1m lottery winner has not seen their daughter for 13 years in the latest sign of tensions tearing his family apart.

Maria Jones said that it was back in 2000 that she last set eyes on Jasmeen, now 17, when Urooj Khan forcibly took her back to India.

Mrs Jones was too poor to afford a lawyer at the time so she was unable to contest custody.

Even today her emotional scars are so deep that she has left a dramatic voicemail on her home answerphone: 'If this is Jasmeen, please leave your number and I will call you. I’ve been waiting to hear from you. I love you.'

The disclosure is another sign that the death of Mr Khan, 46, last July the day after he collected his winning cheque has exposed the divisions within his family.

Tests showed he died from cyanide poisoning but no arrests have been made. His second wife Shabana Ansari, 32, has denied she has anything to do with his death.

Speaking to the Chicago Sun-Times, Mrs Jones, 43, said that she was 'shocked' when she saw her daughter's face on TV earlier this week.

She said: 'I don't know if she knows I'm still alive. I thought she was in India all these years'.

Mrs Jones - formerly Maria Rabadan - met Mr Khan in Chicago where they worked together. They got married in 1991 but they divorced in 1997.

She said that she later reached out to Mr Khan's relatives and was told that he had left the US for India with Jasmeen and did not plan to come back.

Mrs Jones did not want to discuss her relationship with her ex-husband. She merely said it was a 'really really long story' but said she was desperate to see her daughter.

She said: 'I don’t know what she knows. She was so little. I don’t want to hurt her.'

When MailOnline visited Mrs Jones at her home in Granger, Indiana, her husband Billy Jones answered the door and said she was in the bath.

When our reporter called later on the phone he said: 'She has decided not to comment at this time. She's a bit emotional, it's all a bit raw'.

He said: ‘ImTiaz is the one who pushed it to an investigation. Urooj was only 46 years old so he (ImTiaz)  thought that something wasn’t right. How could a man die all of a sudden and one day after winning the lottery? It was weird.

‘When he passed I know that he threw up some blood and in a heart attack you don’t throw up blood.’

The relative said that the killing had sent shockwaves through the Khan family and caused them to ask each other hard, uncomfortable questions.

Requesting he not be identified, the relative said: ‘I don’t want to cause any trouble or make enemies that I don’t know exist.

‘Anything is possible. It’s something you hear about on TV or CSI.

‘I don’t want to cause trouble and make enemies for myself. You never know. Someone poisoned somebody in my family and if I speak anything negative or positive I don’t want anything to happen to my family or me either.

‘This was just for the money, just for the money. I can’t believe it. Hopefully justice will be served and they will find the person who did this.’

The relative also said that Urooj’s daughter Jasmeen, was ‘OK’ and that ‘everyone’s supporting her’.

The relative said: ‘She’s doing the best she can, we’re all there for her.’

Even if Urooj’s body is exhumed none of the family will be there as it will be ‘too painful’ to see, the family member added.

When MailOnline went to ImTiaz’s house nobody answered the door. Two female family members who went in declined to comment.

A woman who answered the phone at the office of his Chicago lawyer Michael Erde said: ‘Mr Erde is not taking calls and has asked me to say he is saying no comment.’

Stephen Cina, the Cook County Medical Examiner, has declined to confirm who it was who called up and asked him to re-investigate the case.

Urooj’s family went to war with Shabana after his death amid claims she tried to cash the winning check in the days after his death.

Urooj’s brother ImTiaz Khan has alleged in probate documents that Shabana attempted to claim the windfall ‘shortly’ after his demise but for some reason was unable to.

ImTiaz also claimed his late brother and his wife were not even married, meaning that she could miss out on the 50 per cent of the lottery prize she would otherwise be entitled to. 

In response, Miss Ansari filed documents of her own which stated she was indeed married to Urooj and the court agreed, making her the administrator of the estate.

In another sign the family are tearing themselves apart, Urooj’s sister Meraj Khan launched a separate legal bid to take guardianship of his daughter from his first marriage, Jasmeen.

Meraj successfully got custody of the 17-year-old even though she appears to have lived with Shabana, her step mother, most of her life.

And as a result of the filings, the jackpot was frozen and will remain so for another three months.

The remaining three months will allow family members to make their case to the lawyer organising how the funds will be handed out - normally it is 50 per cent to the spouse and 50 per cent to the children, unless there are grounds for a complaint.
