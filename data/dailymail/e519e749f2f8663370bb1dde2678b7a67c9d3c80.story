Two men are at the center of a baffling mystery outside Roswell, New Mexico, after they seemed to disappear from the scene of a serious car crash - only to reappear seven hours later in a field of donkeys.

The unidentified men, who admitted to police they had been drinking, rolled their car around 2am on Friday outside the town synonymous with aliens and UFO's.

Emergency responders and firefighters all arrived at the scene of the crash but failed to find any of the occupants of the car, but were called seven hours later by the driver who told the 911 dispatcher he had no memory of the night before.

New Mexico State Police Lt. Emanuel Gutierrez confirmed two men rolled their vehicle into the median of U.S. 70 West, but also said they could not find anyone at the scene.

'The driver stated that he and his passenger where drinking at Way Out West and doesn’t remember what happened next,' Gutierrez said to the Plains Online News.

'The driver also stated that he woke up in a field next to some donkeys.'

While police are not releasing the identity of the driver they did say he and his passenger suffered minor injuries and issued him with multiple citations.

Roswell, New Mexico sprang to international fame on July 8, 1947, when the local newspaper reported the capture of a 'flying saucer' by government officials in the town.

Over the decades since the discovery, conspiracy theorists have insisted that the debris came from an alien spacecraft, and that the fact was covered up by the military.

The continuing belief of alien activity in the area led the Air Force to launch an investigation into the crash in 1995.

Officials concluded that the 'UFO' was part of a balloon launched into the atmosphere as part of a secret government surveillance programme aimed at the USSR.

However, many have refused to accept that explanation, alleging a conspiracy to hide the existence of extra-terrestrial life.
