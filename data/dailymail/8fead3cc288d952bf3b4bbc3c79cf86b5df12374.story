A new report shows that MDMA, the pure form of the party drug ecstasy, can help effectively treat post-traumatic 
stress disorder if coupled with psychotherapy.

The study by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, published recently in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, showed that 83 per cent of participants receiving MDMA-assisted psychotherapy no 
longer qualified for a PTSD diagnosis two months after treatment.

Now, the group is now using MDMA-assisted psychotherapy on 24 first-responders and military veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD.

'With
such encouraging data, including evidence of long-term effectiveness 
after only two or three MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions, there is 
now no doubt that this research should be expanded to larger clinical 
trials,' the study’s principal investigator, Dr. Michael Mithoefer, said
in a statement.

The 24 police officers, firefighters and 
military veterans participating in the newest study will be treated by 
the middle of 2013, MAPS spokesman Brad Burge to the military newspaper Stars and Stripes.

Eleven have 
already received the treatment; results have been promising so far.

Since
the research helped with the progress of some of the most 
treatment-resistant cases of PTSD, researchers believe the treatment 
will be especially helpful for service members, who are typically the 
toughest cases due to their warrior ethos and the stigma associated with
seeking treatment, Burge said.

Almost one in seven service members
returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffers from PTSD, according to the
association’s website.

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs spent 
about $5.5 billion on PTSD disability payments to some 275,000 veterans 
in 2011. The cost and number of veterans suffering from PTSD is expected
to rise.

MAPS is currently working on a 10 year, $15 million plan to make MDMA into an FDA-approved prescription medicine.
