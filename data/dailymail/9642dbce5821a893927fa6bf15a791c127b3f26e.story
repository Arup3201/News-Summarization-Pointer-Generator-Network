A fungus found growing in the grounds of a former hospital is thought to have originated from the boots of First World War soldiers who were treated their for shell shock.

The fungus, Clavulinopsis cinereoide, is relatively common across mainland Europe - though not to Scotland, where the former Craiglockhart War Hospital was based.

Ecologist Abbie Patterson believes that troops sent to Craiglockhart for treatment brought the spores with them after picking them up on their boots while fighting in France.

The hospital, now part of Edinburgh Napier University, was a temporary home to thousands of soldiers during the war - including war poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen who met there in 1917.

Owen, who had been sent there for shell shock treatment, was strongly influenced by Sassoon, who encouraged his friend to write poetry and after Owen's death in 1918 worked to ensure that his friend's works were published.

Mr Patterson found the fungus on a lawn at the university while carrying out a biodiversity audit of the Craiglockhart campus to log every species growing there.

When looking at old photographs taken 
during World War One, he noticed that soldiers and nurses were lined up 
for the pictures in the exact spot where the fungus had been found.

'It is hard not to make a direct link 
between these soldiers and the fact that this fungus – which is 
completely foreign to Scotland but not to Europe – was growing there,' he told the Guardian.

'Its spores may have been brought over to this country after being picked
 up by soldiers in the trenches.'

The fungus has now been confirmed as Clavulinopsis cinereoide and submitted to the Royal Edinburgh Botanic Garden herbarium as the only species of its kind in Scotland.

Mr Patterson said that several other rare plants had been found in front of the hospital site during the audit.

He added: 'These plants survived because the grounds of Craiglockhart were not treated with chemicals over the years. Weedkillers were not used here.'
