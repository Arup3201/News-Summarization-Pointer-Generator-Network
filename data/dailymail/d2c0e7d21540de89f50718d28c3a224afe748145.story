He was only trying to find a comfortable place to catch up on his sleep, but this cunning faredodger has become something of an internet hit after he was caught taking a nap on a bus in Canada.

An OC Transpo employee spotted the fox sneak through an open front door of a bus while it was receiving scheduled maintenance early on Sunday morning in Ottawa.

The fox clearly only had one thing on his mind though, if the pictures taken of him curled up asleep on one of the seats are anything to go by.

Police were informed however, who in turned called the Ottawa Humane Society to retrieve the animal.

Like any typical faredodger though, as soon as the fox woke up and realised the authorities were out to catch him, he jumped off the bus and fled.

Images of the fox asleep on the vehicle have now been widely shared on the internet, and have even inspired a parody Twitter account @OttawaBusFox.

Among the several humorous tweets made on the account is: 'What is the big deal. I was tired. Like none of you have never dozed off on a bus. Did you all get your mugshots in the news? #busfox'

The account has also tweeted: 'No. I did not tap my @PRESTOcard whatever that is. I don't have opposable thumbs. #busfox'

One passenger however was not too impressed and tweeted: 'Typical. The fox falls asleep on the bus and even has his feet on the seat. That's so rude.'

While unusual, reports of animals on public transport are not unheard of.

In December 2011, MailOnline reported on Dodger the ginger tom who found a way to get round the tiresome business of walking anywhere, by hopping on the bus.

The 15-year-old reportedly sat on bemused passengers’ laps as the bus made round trips of up to ten miles from Bridport to Charmouth in Dorset.
