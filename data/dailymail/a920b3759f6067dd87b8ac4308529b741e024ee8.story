Mary Berry has discovered that baking is her genes - after learning her great-great-grandfather was a baker at a 19th century workhouse.

Unbeknown to the Great British Bake Off judge - who is taking part in the BBC1 programme Who Do You Think You Are? - her ancestor Robert Houghton ran a bakery in Norwich in the 19th century, in an area awash with prostitutes and criminals. 

He ran the thriving bakery for nearly 40 years, researchers found, and had a contract to supply a workhouse in the city.

Mary Berry has discovered that baking is her genes - after learning her great-great-grandfather was a baker fora 19th century workhouse

Mr Houghton - a relation on Mrs Berry's mother's side - supplied the workhouse with between 700 and 800 loaves daily, although a local newspaper report from an inspector at the time claimed it was 'so bad that we don't know how to eat it', the Sunday Times reports, although this was later retracted.

Mrs Berry, 79, also researched her paternal family and discovered that her great-great-great grandfather Christopher Berry was a printer and bookseller.

But after he was hit by bankruptcy in the 1811, his wife Mary and six of their children were sent to the workhouse.

Only two of the children - her great, great grandmother, also called Mary, and Chris - were spared the workhouse.

A picture of Mary and her brother balanced on their mother on a makeshift see-saw, in 1938.

While her great, great great uncle Chris abandoned his family - who were then also sent to the poorhouse, Mary went on to have four children, although no father is mentioned on the birth documents.

The baking supremo, who lost her own son William in a car accident when he was 19, can be seen in tears during the episode when she learns of her great-great-grandmother's death at the age of 70, with her youngest son Edward at her side.

She said: 'I know Robert Houghton worked very hard in his bakery, but I think my genes come more from Mary Berry, who survived the workhouse and was very family-oriented - just like me.'
