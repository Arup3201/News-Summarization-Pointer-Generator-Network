Germany has called on Britain not to celebrate the centenary of the First World War but to focus on the idea that the European Union brought peace to the continent.

The government in Berlin recently sent a special envoy to the UK amid fears that the way Britain marks the Great War could affect relations with Angela Merkel’s administration.

Andreas Meitzner called for talks with defence minister Andrew Murrison as well as officials from the Foreign Office and the Department of Culture who are handling the commemorations, which start next year.

A German envoy has voiced concerns over the commemorations taking place to mark the 100-year anniversary of World War One

The German envoy says it would be better to focus on the shared loss of all countries involved in the conflict

British historians have called on the
 UK Government to acknowledge that the conflict was a just war to 
prevent German domination of Europe and to celebrate victory.

But Norman Walter, press attaché at 
the German embassy in London, said ‘it would be easier’ for Britain to 
adopt a ‘less declamatory tone’ if it wants Germany to take part.

In an interview yesterday he said: 
‘We can’t tell you how you should celebrate, but our feeling is that 
issues about who was guilty and all that should be left more or less to 
historians and shouldn’t feature dominantly in politicians’ speeches.

‘The biggest single contribution to 
the start of the First World War was Germany, but others played a part. 
Whether it was a win or not, it wasn’t worth it.

‘We would prefer not to have any 
celebrations, having lost. We don’t want to commemorate the battles. We 
want to commemorate the dead.’

He said that commemorations on the 
continent would focus on the benefits of the EU. He said: ‘The European 
idea is something that helped us overcome the situation where a war like
 this could start, where European countries could go to war with one 
another.

‘It may sound far-fetched here, but 
it doesn’t elsewhere in Europe. The European community will very much be
 part of the German commemoration. Thankfully we have the European 
Union.’

Philip Davies, who sits on the 
Culture Select Committee, denounced the idea that the European Union has
 kept peace since the Second World War as ‘outrageous’, since tensions 
over the eurozone have led to anti-German sentiment across the EU.

He told the Mail: ‘This attitude is 
unacceptable. The Germans might want to forget their history and pretend
 things didn’t happen, but we are not prepared to do that.

‘As for Europe being a cause of 
peace, this chap’s obviously forgotten the reaction Angela Merkel got 
from the Greeks the last time she went there. People dressed up in Nazi 
uniforms, accusing her of completing Hitler’s work.

‘I don’t think people in Greece are celebrating peace. The European Union seems to be having the opposite effect.’

Tory MP Chris Skidmore, a historian 
who sits on the Speaker’s advisory committee on the war, told the Mail 
the events to mark the 100th anniversary should focus on why the war 
began and acknowledge  the victors.

He said: ‘The Great War still casts a
 shadow over modern Europe today. It’s entirely right that we be 
respectful and commemorate the fallen from whichever side. But it would 
be a failure to history if we didn’t recognise not only the causes and 
consequences of the war, but that there were winning sides and losing 
sides.’

The Centenary Advisory Board of 
historians, writers, religious leaders and retired military figures is 
the main body advising the Government on commemorations.

Professor Sir Hew Strachan of Oxford 
University, one of the panel members who has called for a greater 
emphasis on celebrations, said: ‘I understand Germany’s position. There 
is no virtue in offending Germany.

‘But if we are going to be honest to 
the history of this war from a British perspective, then it can’t all be
 about waste and futility.  A lot of people fought and died thinking it 
was worthwhile. We need to respect what those motivations were.’
