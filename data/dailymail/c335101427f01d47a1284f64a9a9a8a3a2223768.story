Ed Miliband faced a growing crisis over welfare yesterday as leading Labour figures backed calls for the party to adopt a tougher stance on benefits.

At least seven of his MPs – including his own parliamentary aide and members of the Shadow Cabinet – said Labour cannot be the party of people ‘languishing on benefits’.

They spoke out as Mr Miliband launched Labour’s local election campaign yesterday, which denounced the Government’s attempts to rein in welfare  spending as ‘heartless and hopeless’.

Challenge: Ed Miliband has faced calls from at least seven MPs to back a tougher stance on welfare, including comments from Simon Danczuk, right, who used an article to call on the Labour leader to change his stance

However, there is growing concern among Labour MPs that Mr Miliband’s blanket opposition to every attempt to trim state handouts has left the party on the wrong side of public opinion. A YouGov poll yesterday showed that 80 per cent of voters think that benefit payments are too  high – including 51 per cent of Labour’s own supporters.

Outlining his views on the issue in an article published online yesterday, Labour MP Simon Danczuk led the calls for Mr Miliband to change his approach.

He said: ‘Seeing people that are capable of working languish for years on benefits is not something the Left should be proud of.

‘It’s something we should be fighting. Otherwise why call ourselves the Labour Party?’

‘Far too many people tell  me they feel their taxes  are “wasted” on welfare largesse and these voices cannot be ignored.’

‘If welfare is to be targeted more efficiently at those who need it then we have to condemn those who abuse the system.’

‘The Labour Party is a moral crusade or it is nothing, said Harold Wilson. It’s time this sense of crusading zeal was applied to helping people off benefits. Seeing people that are capable of working languish for years on benefits is not something the Left should be proud  of. It’s something we should be fighting.’

‘The Left has to accept there are some people on the dole that don’t want  to work, and we need to  have a plan to get them  into work.’

Earlier, the MP had tweeted that ‘simply complaining about cuts to benefits is easy, comfy, cosy politics which doesn’t help anyone’.

Labour MPs who mostly represent working-class constituencies then used Twitter to show their support for his calls by endorsing Mr Danczuk’s article.

Ian Austin, a former aide to Gordon Brown who is now a Labour frontbencher on work and pensions, tweeted: ‘Completely right to say people left “for years on benefits  not something Left should be  proud of”.’

Labour’s international development spokesman Ivan Lewis and Mr Miliband’s parliamentary private secretary Jonathan Reynolds retweeted a link to Mr Danczuk’s article, as did rising star Gloria De Piero, another frontbencher.

Chesterfield MP Toby Perkins called it a ‘strong’ article, while Scunthorpe MP Nic Dakin hailed it as an ‘excellent contribution to the welfare debate’, adding: ‘It’s time to hear new voices grounded in experience.’

Former Labour general secretary Peter Watt said it was evidence of ‘sanity on welfare’.

By contrast, Mr Miliband yesterday took aim at the Government’s plans for welfare reform.

He also accused David Cameron and George Osborne of ‘exploiting’ the case of child killer Mick  Philpott last week when they condemned how the benefits system allowed him to milk £60,000 out of the state each year after fathering  17 children.

Mr Miliband said: ‘Here’s the problem with this Government – they are not just heartless, they are hopeless too.

Support: Ian Austin, left, and Toby Perkins appeared to back Mr Danczuk's comments in the article

‘Do you try and unite the country and
bring it together, or do you exploit tragedy, like the Philpott 
tragedy, and the right place for him is behind bars.

Talking tough: Liam Byrne had called for a return to the contributory principle in comments at the weekend

‘Of course there are a minority of people on benefits who should be working and are not.

‘Labour is the party that is going to get them back to work. But what I’m not going to do is engage in nasty, divisive politics.

‘If people want that nasty, divisive politics, then you have got the Conservative Party – you’re not going to get it from me.’

But shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne sought to talk tough on the issue at the weekend. He called for a return to the contributory principle under which those who have worked for years get more generous benefits than those who have not.

He also suggested the jobless should go to the back of the queue for council housing.

But those proposals began to unravel within hours, with Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman stressing that the plans were only ideas for ‘discussion’ and were  not party policy. Former Labour welfare reform minister Frank  Field said the party faced a huge  challenge on the subject, adding: ‘We have been here before, and we ducked it before.

‘The real question is, as Labour now moves up towards the general election, are we going to have an alternative.’
