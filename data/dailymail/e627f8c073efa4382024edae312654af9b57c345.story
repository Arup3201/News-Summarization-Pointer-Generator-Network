We are more accustomed to seeing them stomping around Essex's most glamorous clubs dressed in figure-hugging dresses and sky-high stilettos.

But The Only Way Is Essex's leading ladies have dressed down for a change - and it's all in the name of charity.

Sam and Billie Faiers and Jessica Wright showed their support for Asda’s BBC Children in Need campaign by modelling the official merchandise in a series of fun and playful shots alongside none other than Pudsey bear.

Would you wear that to Sugar Hut? Jessica Wright, Billie and Sam Faiers jumped for joy in their yellow Pudsey onesies for a Children In Need campaign

The TOWIE trio even pulled on vibrant yellow onesies to encourage the nation to raise much needed funds for disadvantaged children and young people living in the UK.

Speaking about the campaign, Jess Wright said: 'I'm thrilled to be involved in Asda's BBC Children in Need campaign and shoot this year.

'It's a really fun and inspiring way to raise awareness for an amazing cause that makes a positive change to the lives of some of the most disadvantaged young people across the UK.'

Billie said: 'I love watching BBC's Children in Need so to do my bit for the campaign this year is a real honour.

Not their usual look: We are used to seeing them dressed to the nines in tight dresses but the TOWIE trio sported a more casual look for their new campaign

Sister sister: Sam and Billie donned some yellow Pudsey ears and say they hope they've inspired people to do their bit this year and support the campaign

'I love the Pudsey onesies and hopefully they will encourage the nation to buy as many goodies as possible from Asda.'

Sister Sam added: 'BBC's Children in Need makes a huge difference to so many young people in Britain, I hope we've inspired people to do their bit this year and support the campaign by donating and buying the amazing Pudsey onesies and T-shirts from Asda.'

For the thirteenth year running Asda is BBC Children in Need’s fundraising partner.

To date Asda has raised over £10million, which has helped to change the lives of a significant amount of children across the nation.

Is that Arg? The girls even cuddled up to a life-size Pudsey bear as part of the charity campaign

Asda's Charity Partnership Manager Lisa Burnett said: 'We know our customers and colleagues love supporting BBC Children in Need.

'The majority of our shoppers are mums and therefore they feel very strongly about helping disadvantaged children and young people across the UK. We want to make it as fun and simple as possible for people to do their bit and what could be easier than sporting a stylish t-shirt and hoodie or a fabulous Pudsey onesie. 

'The TOWIE girls look fabulous and we hope the nation will join them to help raise awareness and much needed funds this year.' 

Their usual look: Sam and Billie Faires show off their assets in a promotional snap for last year's TOWIE Christmas special
