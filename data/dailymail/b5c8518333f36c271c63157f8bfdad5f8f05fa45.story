The ambulance later returned to the scene where it was examined by police officers before being loaded onto a recovery vehicle and taken away for further analysis.

The accident happened at the junction of London Road and Snow Hill near the River Avon.

The ambulance service spokeswoman said: 'At 4.01pm this afternoon, an ambulance crew responding to a 999 emergency reported to our clinical hub that they had struck a child near the junction with London Road and Snow Hill in Bath.

'They reported the child - a boy believed to be approximately 10 years old - had suffered a significant head injury.

'The patient was placed in the ambulance and taken by the crew straight to Royal United Hospital where he is now being treated.'

A spokeswoman for South Western Ambulance Service said the boy is now in a 'stable condition'.

'He was transferred to Frenchay Hospital because he is suffering from head trauma and the hospital has a specialist major trauma unit,'she added.

'Due to the serious condition of the patient, police gave permission for the ambulance to leave the scene to take him to hospital,' said the spokesman.

'Clearly our primary concern is for the patient and his family - senior executives from South Western Ambulance Service have travelled to Bath and will offer to meet with the family.
