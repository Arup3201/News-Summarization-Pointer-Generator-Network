Professor David Pitts, of American University, is charged with burglary and destruction of property

An American University department head has been arrested for allegedly breaking into a shopping mall near campus and setting a fire.

Professor David Pitts, who chairs the Department of Public Administration and Policy, was charged with burglary and destruction of property, the Washington Post reported.

He was being held on Friday pending a court appearance.

Police in Washington, DC, were called to Foxhall Square Shopping Mall about 3am on Thursday for a report of a small fire near a parking attendant booth, WJLA reported.

Pitts, 37, was arrested with matches, lighters, gloves and a newspaper, according to the station.

He also allegedly pried open a door in the back of the building, which is about two blocks from campus, and burglarized it, WTTG reported.

Police did not immediately disclose a motive for the incident.

In a statement Friday, American University said Pitts has been placed on leave pending the result of an investigation by the Metropolitan Police Department.

'At this time, we are not aware of any safety threats to our community and we are working closely with MPD and AU Public Safety to continually assess the situation,' the statement said.

His duties have been reassigned to other faculty members.

Profesor Alison Jacknowitz will take over as the department chair while other lecturers assume Pitts' classes.

Pitts has been a professor at American University since 2005, where his research focuses on diversity in public policy.
