Novak Djokovic and wife Jelena Ristic have become parents to a baby boy.

The world No 1 announced in April that the couple were expecting their first child.

And reports in Serbian media revealed that the 'healthy' baby was born on Tuesday evening.

Djokovic, 27, has not played since losing to Roger Federer in the semi-finals of the Shanghai Masters on October 11.

He is scheduled to play in the Paris Masters next week, although the arrival of his first child could have an impact.

Djokovic and his wife have been together since 2006 and married in Montenegro in July just days after he won his seventh Grand Slam title at Wimbledon.
