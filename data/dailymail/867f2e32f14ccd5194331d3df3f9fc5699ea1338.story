Police arrested a Nevada assemblyman on Saturday after he claimed he was going to shoot a fellow Democratic representative.

Brooks was taken to the Las Vegas City Jail on one count of intimidating a public officer by threat of physical violence. He was reportedly unhappy with his committee assignments.

The assemblyman for North Las Vegas publicly threatened to shoot Kirkpatrick on Saturday afternoon.

When witnesses corroborated the allegations, police tracked Brooks down and took him into custody with a traffic stop with no incident at 6 pm. He was carrying a loaded weapon.

Brooks, who was first elected in 2010, reportedly spent Saturday night in jail. Kirkpatrick was said to be shaken but doing fine.

The Las Vegas Sun reported that colleagues had begun to notice Brooks' 'erratic' behavior in caucus meetings.

The Nevada State Assembly has recently experienced turmoil after its previous speaker lost his bid for re-election.

Brooks was reportedly hoping to be named as chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, a group that controls changes to the governorâ€™s proposed budget.

But the prestigious position went to Assemblywoman Maggie Carlton instead.

Executive Director of the Assembly Democratic Caucus Brendan Summers told Ktnv: 'We understand an investigation is currently ongoing and we have no further comment at this time.'
