Most likely to return home to the U.S. from bases in Germany

The United States is planning to drastically reduce the number of soldiers that it keeps based in Europe.

The move, to be announced tomorrow by Defence Secretary Leon Panetta, is part of a massive cost-cutting review.

The number of brigade combat teams, each consisting of between 3,000 and 4,000 troops, will be slashed from three to two. The soldiers going home are likely to be from one of the two infantry brigades in Germany.

'Deeply involved': Barack Obama has instructed Defence Secretary Leon Panetta to cut military costs by reducing the number of troops in Europe

The decision continues a U.S. drawdown from the continent that has seen a force of 300,000 during the Cold War fall to fewer than 80,000 today. 

Mr Panetta is also expected to say the U.S. is abandoning its strategy of maintaining a force that can fight and win two wars at the same time.

Instead, America will aim to triumph in one war while being able to meet and ‘spoil’ any aggressive actions by a second adversary.

The eight-month review was ordered by 
President Obama, who wants the Pentagon to slice up to $470 billion from
the Pentagon budget over the next 12 years.

Mr Obama was said to have been ‘deeply involved’ in the review process. 

The pullout of U.S. troops from Europe was first suggested by George Bush’s defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, but it was put on hold because of the demands placed on the military by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The spending reductions, while not yet set in stone, are expected to trim the number of military and civilian defense personnel, delay or cut back on some high-profile weapons systems like the radar-evading F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and take steps to control spiraling health-care costs.

A senior defense official said Mr 
Panetta would unveil some details affecting major weapons programs but 
added that he did not expect the kind of ‘bloodbath’ another former 
Defence Secretary Robert Gates announced in April 2009, when he killed 
or cut back on many weapons systems.

Major
defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman 
have been anxiously awaiting news about any major programme cuts in the 
new budget.

Slowdowns are 
expected in several new weapons programs, including two-year delays in 
work on a replacement for the Ohio-class submarine and on a second new 
Ford-class aircraft carrier.

In
an effort to get control of the government's huge deficits, Obama and 
Congress agreed last year on a budget deal that could cut projected 
defense spending by more than $937 billion over the next decade.

Heading home: The U.S. military presence in Europe is shrinking and it is thought that soldiers may be brought back from bases like Ramstein in Germany
