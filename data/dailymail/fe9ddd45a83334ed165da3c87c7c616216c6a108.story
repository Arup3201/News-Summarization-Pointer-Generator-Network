Laura Robson appears set to shelve plans to make her comeback next week at a low-key event in Arizona.

The former British No 1, whose last appearance came more than 12 months ago at the Australian Open, had been considering a return at a $25,000 lower-tier tournament at a place called Surprise starting next Monday.

Her agent, Max Eisenbud, was quoted in Melbourne last month as pinpointing this as her comeback schedule ahead of making a return to the full WTA Tour at the much higher profile Indian Wells event in early March.

Laura Robson is not likely to appear in the lower-tier Surprise, Arizona, tournament as initially planned 

However, informed sources say that, while there has not been any major setback in her rehabilitation, her wrist is still not ready for the rigours of full-on competition.

The 21-year-old former British No 1 is adamant she won't rush back from a long-suffered wrist injury 

While Eisenbud was not responding to inquiries, it is also suggested that it is far from certain that she will play at Indian Wells or the Miami Open that follows it later next month.

Robson was struggling with wrist problems from late 2013 onwards and in late April of 2014 underwent surgery, putting her in a cast for the rest of the summer.

She was able to return to training and practice later on last year, working mostly in Florida, but as with all wrist injuries in tennis it has proved a torturously long process, and the watchword has always been caution.

Former US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro is the most prominent example of this and has been plagued by issues off and on for nearly four years, having undergone surgery on both wrists.

He played at the ATP event in Sydney last month but then had to pull out of the Australian Open, and has subsequently had another minor procedure done on his left wrist.

Although she has found the hiatus in her career immensely frustrating, Robson is adamant that she will not be rushing back until she feels absolutely ready, although she is said to be doing plenty of hitting.

A clue to her immediate plans could be found in a reply on her ever-lively Twitter feed, which said she planned to go and see 50 Shades of Grey this weekend.
