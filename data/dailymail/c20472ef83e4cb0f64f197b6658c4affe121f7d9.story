An Afghan presidential candidate today made veiled threats of civil war as he claimed election results had been distorted by voter fraud.

Abdullah Abdullah told thousands of supporters at a rally in Kabul he had been called by both Barack Obama and John Kerry after he refused to accept the preliminary results.

Although he asked supporters for a few days to negotiate, there were fears that Mr Abdullah could ignore the result and declare victory, something he hinted at during his speech.

He said: 'People across the county call on us to announce our government and I can't not say no to people's wish, we don't want civil war, we don't want crisis.

'All of our lives we defended this country. We do not want crisis, we want national unity. We don't want separation, we don't want civil war.'

The Afghan Independent Election Commission released preliminary election results yesterday showing former finance minister Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai well in the lead for the presidency.

But officials added that no winner could be declared because millions of ballots were being audited for fraud.

Preliminary results showed that Mr Ahmadzai had about 4.5million votes, or 56 per cent, while Mr Abdullah had 3.5million votes, or 44 per cent, according to the commission. Turnout was more than 50 per cent.

'We do not want crisis, we want national unity. We don't want separation, we don't want civil war,' said Mr Abdullah, whose comments stocked fears he may spark a crisis by unilaterally declaring victory

Many of Mr Abdullah's supporters, who packed into a meeting hall in Kabul for the rally, were angry over the result.

Mr Abdullah told them: 'We denounce and do not accept the results of fraudulent vote. I assure you people of Afghanistan that I will sacrifice for you, but I will never accept a fraudulent government.

'We announce that only the government elected through clean votes will come to power.'

He told them he was expecting Mr Kerry to fly into the Afghan capital on Friday for meetings to help defuse the crisis, a trip State Department officials would not confirm.

The turmoil came as violence escalated around the country.

An Afghan official says that at least 16 people, including four Czech soldiers, were killed Tuesday in a suicide attack near a clinic in eastern Afghanistan.

The Czech defence ministry confirmed the loss of its soldiers and added that another was badly wounded by the blast. The ministry said it will release more details later in the day.

Wahid Seddiqi, spokesman for the governor of Parwan province, said the soldiers, at least 10 civilians, and two police officers were killed when the bomber detonated his bomb near Charakar, the provincial capital.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement sent to the media

The announcement came as Mr Ahmadzai was locked in a standoff with Mr Abdullah, who has refused to accept any results until all fraudulent ballots are invalidated.

A spokesman for his campaign rejected the results and called the decision to release them 'a coup.'

The election commission acknowledged that vote rigging had occurred and said ballots from about 7,000 more of the nearly 23,000 polling stations would be audited.

Mr Abdullah charged that outgoing President Hamid Karzai, Ahmadzai and the election commission were colluding.

'President Karzai, the election commissions and Ashraf Ghani's team are all one. They ignored us and announced the fraudulent results,' he said.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said during a visit to Tokyo that any action to seize power illegally in Afghanistan would lead to the end of U.S. financial and security support.

Kerry said suggestions of a 'parallel government' in Afghanistan were a grave concern and added that he expected Afghan electoral institutions to conduct a full review of all reasonable allegations of irregularities.

He said there was no justification for violence or threats of extralegal action.

'President Obama called me today saying John Kerry is coming to Kabul on Friday. President Obama and Kerry both called me this morning, promised to help us in cleaning up votes,' Abdullah told the crowd.

'John Kerry phoned me before the announcement and told me that his envoys would seek a legal solution for the problems created in here.'
