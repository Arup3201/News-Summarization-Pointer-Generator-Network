One of Britain's most powerful independent politicians 'wouldn't know the truth if it slapped him in the face,' an electoral fraud trial heard today.

Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman, 49, faced the claim at the High Court after he branded a Labour opponent 'institutionally racist' - despite the 'institution' being one man.

Rahman is in his second term in the deprived East London borough, where critics claim voters were intimidated, opponents were smeared and ballot papers were forged in last year's election.

Historic: The High Court is hearing the rare electoral trial, which could result in a new election, mayor Rahman being suspended or banned from office or completely exonerated

The claims led four voters to force a rare electoral fraud trial against Rahman at London's High Court, where he denies all the allegations against him. 

If commissioner Richard Mawrey QC finds allegations of corruption proved, he has the power to declare the election void.

Case: Lutfur Rahman is facing a litany of allegations in a rare High Court electoral fraud trial

Today a row erupted as Rahman was asked whether he stood by comments he made about John Biggs, his  former colleague in the Labour party who became a rival after Rahman left. 

He attacked Mr Biggs, 57, as being 'institutionally racist' after he said in 2013 that the Mayor was biased in favour of the Bangladeshi community.

The London Assembly member had told the BBC: 'All of the Mayor's Cabinet are Bangladeshi and his primary policy focus has been the concerns of one community, the Bangladeshi community'.

Rahman said the comments were 'outrageous' and maintained the East End community had been in uproar - despite being unable to cite any specific examples.

The court heard his campaign manager, Alibor Choudhury, issued a press release the following February which claimed Mr Biggs was 'Dividing the East End' and insinuated he was a racist.

Rahman repeatedly avoided giving direct answers about whether he felt Mr Biggs was a racist, until Commissioner Mr Mawrey, a deputy High Court judge, intervened.

The judge asked: 'Is it your view that Mr Biggs is a racist?'

Rahman replied: 'What I would say, my Lord, is racism comes in various forms.

'There is direct racism and indirect racism, institutional racism.'

The judge repeated the question, to which Rahman replied, 'My personal view is that he is institutionally racist'.

The judge was left baffled and replied: 'I don't think an individual person can be institutionally racist'.

Francis Hoar, for the voters who have brought the case, agreed - saying: 'A human being can't be an institution, its as simple as that'.

Pressed again, Rahman said, 'What I would say, my Lord, is racism comes in various forms, various forms.

'He is not a racist in the sense of skinheads, Dr Martens, cropped hair et cetera.

'He is a highly intelligent person, but racism can also come in very subtle forms.'

Both forms of racism cause 'the same devastation', the mayor added.

Victory: Rahman after his first election win in 2010. He won another vote against Labour last May

But Mr Hoar said to Rahman, 'You have done nothing but lie. You wouldn't know the truth if it slapped you in the face.'

Rahman spoke directly to the judge, responding, 'My future is in the hands of my Lordship'.

He said he would not 'throw away' his future by lying.

The trial has been brought by four petitioners, Tower Hamlets residents Andrew Erlam, Debbie Simone, Azmal Hussein and Angela Moffat. 

Mayor Rahman denies any wrongdoing.

The trial continues.
