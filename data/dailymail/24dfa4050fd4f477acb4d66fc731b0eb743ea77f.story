A stunning collection of photographs of World War One battlefields as they are today are to go on show in Britain for the first time.

A hundred years on, with no one alive to remember the 'war to end all wars', only the landscape bears witness to the events that killed 21 million men women and children.

The Somme, Passchendaele, Ypres and Verdun and so many other battlefields may be just names in history books today, but the sites along the western front have recovered their former tranquility and peace.

Memory of war: The Champagne  Battlefield burial site memorial left intact on the Western Front with the soldier's equipment left on the grave, along with a plaque placed there by his father in 1919

Craters: An aerial view of the Newfoundland Memorial Park in Beaumont Hamel, Northern France, with its shell craters and trenches

Battlefield: A major allied offensive took place in 1916 at  Messines Ridge on the southern end of the Ypres Salient with over 8,000 metres of tunnels dug and 21 mines containing almost 600 tonnes of explosives  laid under the German lines

A father's tribute to his dead son is illustrated by the young man's helmet and equipment adorning his graveside with a plaque at the Champagne battle site.

Fifteen haunting images taken by World Press Photo award-winning photographer Mike St Maur Shiel go on show next month between November 5 and 14th in a street gallery exhibition - Fields of Battle Lands of Peace 14 – 18 - at Westminster Hall after being given permission by the Black Rod.

The freestanding photographs, each measuring 1.2 metres (4ft) by 1.8 metres (5ft 10in), are the result of a six-year project and reveal the transformation of the battlefields of the 1914-18 war into the landscape of modern Europe.

In August 2014, the exhibition opens in London with 60 images in central London before touring across
 the UK and Ireland's major cities during the centenary until 2018 based on
 a timeline of World War One events.

St Maur Sheil said: 'This collection represents a legacy which I hope will create
 a gateway to the battlefields themselves, encouraging people to 
visit these historic landscapes during the centennial period and so 
create awareness and understanding of the events.'

St Maur Sheil who won his award in 2002 for his work on child trafficking in West Africa, began taking the battle field pictures after visiting Dunkirk with his father who served there in 1940 with the London Irish Rifles.

'Oddly enough he featured in what has 
become one of the iconic images of that battle but what came as a 
complete surprise to me was the extraordinary memory he had for 
what appeared to me to be feature-less fields, ' he said.

'We visited Ypres and I watched him as he
 stood erect at the Menin Gate, fighting back his tears: it was an 
emotion I had never been exposed to before.

'The men of 1914-18 largely saw the land 
torn apart and stripped of its covering mantle of grass and trees, it's 
bones literally laid bare as they sought shelter within its protective 
skin.'

His images of the former battle fields extend over 600 kilometres from the coast of the English Channel, across Belgium and northern 
and eastern France as far as the Swiss border.

The exhibition, conceived jointly with historian, the late Sir Richard Holmes and Chris Bridge of street gallery pioneers, WeCommunic8, includes fascinating archive imagery, historical information and educational content

Chris Bridge of street gallery pioneers Wecommunic8 said:  'Fields of Battle' will engage with all social groups, whilst creating a high level intellectual and emotional connection with audiences.'
