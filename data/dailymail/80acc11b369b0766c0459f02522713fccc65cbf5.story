Home Secretary Theresa May faced a wave of criticism yesterday after proposing anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) to deter British jihadis who cause terror in Iraq and Syria.

Mrs May came under fire after saying Asbos could be used to curb extremists’ behaviour and language and could lead to jail if breached.

The plan, following the brutal murder of a US journalist by an Islamic State militant thought to be British, won support from No 10 but was condemned by some Tory and Labour MPs.

Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the powerful Commons Home Affairs Committee, branded Mrs May’s plan ‘too little, too late’.

Muslim Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi warned that the proposals were ‘counter- productive and reactive’.

Former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis, writing in today’s Mail on Sunday, said Mrs May’s response lacked focus and urgency. In mocking tones, Mr Davis asked: ‘Asbos for terrorists? It is hard to imagine the ISIS killers quaking in their boots.’

Dismissing the Government’s response so far to the crisis as ‘tentative, uncertain, almost limp,’ he demanded a range of tough measures including stripping British people fighting for IS of their UK citizenship. Lord Carey, former Archbishop of Canterbury, also calls today for Britons pursuing jihad in Iraq and Syria to lose their passports.

In an article for The Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘They should not have access to the privilege of travelling under a British passport . . . and they certainly should not be able to travel back with the barbaric and bloodthirsty skills they have gained.’

Meanwhile, the Government last night confirmed for the first time it was supplying body armour and night-vision equipment to help Kurdish forces combat IS terrorists.
