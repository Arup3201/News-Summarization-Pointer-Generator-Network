Accident: Desiree Gill, the top Australian jockey who died after a fall from her horse

A top female jockey has died after a horror crash on an Australian track - the second woman rider to be killed in the country in two months.

Premiership winning jockey Desiree Gill, a 45-year-old mother of two, received critical injuries when her mount, Celtic Ambition, clipped the heels of another horse and crashed to the ground on Queensland's Sunshine Coast.

Miss Gill sustained a head injury when the horse catapulted her heavily into the turf and she died in hospital later.

She had recently returned to racing 'better than ever' after receiving severe leg injuries five years ago.

Only last week she rode the first four winners at Bundaberg, Queensland, on Melbourne Cup day and ran third in the only other race at the meeting.

The shock death comes two months after Darwin's leading rider Simone Montgomerie died following a fall in August.

Many thought that Miss Gill's decades-long riding career was over when she was seriously injured in the training accident in 2008, but she endured a lengthy rehabilitation and returned to the track to start winning again.

'It was an indication of her toughness,' said Mr Spencer Slatter, president of the Gympie Turf Club, the town that Miss Gill comes from.

It was in Gympie in August that she was crowned the town's champion jockey for the year 2012-2013 following 27 wins, while husband Barry was champion trainer with 21 winners.

'She lived and breathed racing, arriving at the stables at 4am and she had a busy schedule that including tutoring younger riders, training horses and racing, Mr Slatter told the Brisbane Times.

'Racing was her whole life, from dawn till dusk. She put a lot into the industry and she loved it.'

Miss Gill and her husband, said Mr Slatter, 'made a formidable team.'

Her death, said Mr Darren Condon, boss of Racing Queensland, would have a serious impact on the racing community.

Racing photographer Michael McInally recalled that many apprentices came to Miss Gill to learn. 'She was there to help them. She was a great person and will be very missed,' he said.

'The horse racing industry is such a tight-knit community so when someone loses their life, everyone feels it.'
