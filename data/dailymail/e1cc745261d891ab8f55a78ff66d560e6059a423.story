A former Sinn Fein councillor was one
of two dissident republican terrorists jailed for life yesterday over 
the murder of a policeman gunned down in his unmarked car.

Brendan
McConville, 40, and accomplice John Paul Wootton, 20, were said to be 
‘intimately involved’ in the planning of the murder of Police Service of
Northern Ireland (PSNI) Constable Stephen Carroll.

The
48-year-old officer became the first policeman killed by republican 
terrorists since the Royal Ulster Constabulary was replaced by the PSNI 
as part of peace process reforms. The Continuity IRA claimed 
responsibility for the attack.

murdering police officer Stephen Carroll and jailed for life

PC Carroll was shot in the head as he
sat at the wheel of his car as colleagues attended a 999 call at a 
private development in Craigavon, County Armagh.

The prosecution told Belfast Crown Court the officer, who was nearing the end of a 12-hour shift, had been lured to his death.

The March 2009 murder occurred just two days after two British soldiers were shot dead outside barracks in the province.

Lord Justice Paul Girvan described PC Carroll’s murder as a ‘callous and cowardly crime’.

The evidence of a secret witness, known as Witness M, proved crucial in convicting the two men.

He placed McConville - who served a term on Craigavon Borough Council 
before leaving amid rumours he had a drink problem - at the scene of the
murder on the night in question.

Overweight and with ginger hair, the judge agreed McConville, from Craigavon, was an easy figure to remember.

Witness M also saw Wootton’s car parked nearby and saw it leave shortly afterwards.

The unemployed youth, who grew up in the peace process era and knew 
little of the Troubles, had already come to the attention of Army 
surveillance officers, who had placed a tracking device under the 
Citroen Saxo in the period leading up to the murder. The bug confirmed 
the car’s close proximity to the murder scene at the relevant time.

Wootton was arrested within hours of the killing but, like the 
softly-spoken McConville, stayed silent despite dozens of police 
interviews.

The product of a broken home and regarded as a troublemaker by fellow 
residents on the estate where he lived, Wootton had been active in 
dissident republicanism from a young age and officers discovered 
pictures of him dressed in paramilitary regalia from a mobile phone.

A jacket found in Wootton’s car belonging to McConville was found to be 
covered in gunshot residue. It is believed it was used to wrap up the 
AK47 assault rifle used to kill the policeman.

Wootton, of Lurgan, County Armagh, was also convicted of collecting 
information for use in terrorism. He was found guilty of trying to 
obtain the address of another policeman weeks before the murder.

During the trial, Wootton’s mother - 39-year-old Sharon Wootton, of the 
same address as her son - plead guilty to obstructing the police 
investigation into the murder.

She admitted removing computer equipment from their house ahead of police searches.

The
constable’s widow Kate, 61, said she felt ‘pity and disgust’ for the 
killers and added that dissident republican terror groups were ‘fighting
a losing battle.’

Her husband’s murder came just two days after the Real IRA shot dead two soldiers outside Masereene Barracks in Antrim.

In January, Brian Shivers, 46, from Magherafelt, County Londonderry, was
convicted of murdering Mark Quinsey, 23, and Patrick Azimkar, 21. A 
second man was cleared.

Grief: Kate Carroll, second left, is seen at her husband's funeral. Stephen Carroll's death prompted an outcry from all sides of the community
