CCTV footage from a 'haunted' Midlands pub captures the moment staff say a ghost pushed a bottle of cordial off the bar.

A series of strange incidents have been reported at The Old Crown in Digbeth, Birmingham - where barmaids and cleaners claim a ghost pinches their bottoms.

Staff at the pub now believe they have surveillance footage which proves the ghoul's existence.

The video shows a bottle of blackcurrant cordial mysteriously moving across a surface and falling on the ground.

The incident was witnessed by two customers seated at the bar, Andy Lightfoot, 48, and Rudie Jones, 26, who immediately leaned over to get a look at what had happened.

Mr Lightfoot, a builder from Ellesmere Port who was staying in the pub at the time, said: 'It was very freaky. We couldn't understand how on earth the bottle toppled over the bar like that.'

The eerie incident happened when barmaid Amy Carter had momentarily left the bar to go to the basement.

Ms Carter, 24, says: 'I went down to the cellar to get some more spirits and suddenly I heard a big bang from upstairs.

'I immediately rushed back to the bar to see Andy and Rudie leaning over staring at the bottle on the floor.

'They told me what happened and I was spooked. It's so weird.'

The Old Crown's Landlord, Ciaran Healy, initially refused to believe Andy's and Rudie's explanation.

Barmaid Amy Carter was present when the bottle smashed and says she has experienced the ghost herself

Mr Healy, 24, said: 'When I came to the bar and saw the blackcurrant cordial on the floor, I was furious.

'I thought Andy and Rudie had been messing around and dropped the bottle on purpose. We were really busy that night. I didn't appreciate them fooling around like this.

'But Andy and Rudie kept swearing that it wasn't them and begged me to check out the CCTV footage.

'I actually made a £20 bet that they had pushed the bottle themselves as a prank. But when I saw the recording, I couldn't believe it. I tried to explain it away.

'I thought maybe Andy and Rudie had used some string to push the bottle but there's no rational explanation for what happens in that video. It's shaken me.'

There have been several ghosts sightings reported at The Old Crown, which dates from 1368.

Barmaid Miss Carter and another female staff member claim that they have had their bottoms pinched by the ghost.

Staff have even quit their jobs at the historic pub - which Queen Elizabeth I reportedly stayed in - because of fears about ghosts.

The pub dates back to the 14th century and is near the site of The Battle of Camp Hill in the English Civil War

Bar staff say they thought drinkers were pulling their legs when they first heard of the incident, but now say they are convinced it was the work of the ghost

Mr Healy added: 'Two years ago, our long-serving chef came in one morning and saw a ghostly figure of a lady walk straight through a door.

'He was so scared afterwards that he locked himself in the disabled toilet until the other staff arrived. A day later, he quit the job for good even though he'd been really happy at The Old Crown.

'To be honest, we usually try to detach ourselves from our ghostly reputation because it makes it hard to find employees who are willing to work here.

'Barmaids don't usually stay long here because they become terrified of the place when they're locking up at night.'

Mr Healy has hired psychic mediums in a bid to put an end to the ghostly sightings.

'We've had several mediums come to The Old Crown. The Battle of Camp Hill during The English Civil War, was fought just outside the pub so they reckon that's why we have so many ghosts here.

'A few mediums have talked about a drunken ghost called Gus - who we think is responsible for pinching bottoms and smashing bottles.

'The psychics also mentioned a ghostly woman whose baby fell down the well that we have in The Old Crown. Apparently, she wanders around longing for her lost child.'
