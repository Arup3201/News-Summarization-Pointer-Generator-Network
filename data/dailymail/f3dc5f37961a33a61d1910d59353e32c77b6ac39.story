The badly decomposed body of an elderly woman has been discovered in her flat where she lay undiscovered for six years.

Anne Leitrim, who was in her 70s, had not been seen since 2008 and neighbours had assumed she moved out of the area because her home appeared empty.

Incredibly, two windows to the ground floor flat had remained opened in all that time.

Shocking: The body of a pensioner lay undiscovered in a Bournemouth house for six years, as neighbours assumed she'd moved out of the area

Access: Incredibly, Mrs Leitrim's body lay undiscovered despite windows to the property being open

Mrs Leitrim's modest home is in a block of eight flats and even backs on to a communal garden that is regularly used.

Residents at the flats in Bournemouth, Dorset, joked it looked so abandoned there could be a body in it, unaware Mrs Leitrim was dead inside.

Her remains were finally found when bailiffs visited the property in the 1980s-built block to collect unpaid debts.

After getting no answer at the door they got into the property through one of the open windows and made the grim discovery.

Shocked neighbours have spoken of feeling guilty that it had taken such a long period of time for anyone to realise Mrs Leitrim was dead.

They described her as being friendly and softly spoken with a Scottish accent.

John Stanley, 55, who has lived in the building in the Throop area of Bournemouth for the eight years, said: ‘Everyone is so shocked.

Tragic: Anne Leitrim, who was in her 70s, had not been seen since 2008  

‘We didn't think anyone was living in the flat. Her car went and we just thought she had moved out.

‘There are cobwebs in the windows and we used to joke there could be a body inside but we had no idea.

‘When the bailiffs and locksmiths came to the flat they entered the property through two windows that had been left ajar.

‘The windows were slightly open and they used a coat hanger to get inside.

‘The locksmith went in and said 'I think there's a body'. It was so decomposed he couldn't tell.’

Shock: Neighbours including Ruth Evans (left) and Debbie Small (right) have spoke of their horror at the discovery

Ruth Evans, 59, who has lived in the building for six years, added: ‘It makes me feel guilty. You think of all the times we were out in the garden and she was just lying there.

‘When her car disappeared we all thought she had moved away. When I heard there was a body inside I couldn't believe it.’

Debbie Small, who has lived in the same street for two years, said: ‘It is really sad. It is a really friendly street and we all know each other. I can't believe it.’

Neighbour Mr Stanley said: 'Bailiffs arrived on Tuesday because she had been defaulting on her mortgage payments since May last year.

'It turned out she had been making automatic payments from her bank account for four years after she died.

'To think she has been lying there all this time is heartbreaking.

'She was lying on the floor next to the bed with her hand over her chest. They think she probably had a heart attack.'

Mr Stanley revealed the residents of the other flats in the block held garden parties right outside Mrs Lietrim's flat without realising she lay dead.

He added: 'It is absolutely tragic and has left us all in shock. She used to keep herself to herself and no-one really knew her very well.

'She drove a red car and then one day it just wasn't here any more. We all assumed she had moved out and didn't think any more about it.

'I'd never seen any family or friends visiting her, and the only person who ever approached her door was the postman. 

Last year TV presenter Esther Rantzen set up the charity The Silver Line - a free phoneline for old people who are lonely.

A spokesman for the charity said it was a 'sad and shocking' case.

Charity Contact the Elderly, which says it offers a vital lifeline of friendship to those aged 75 and over, who live alone, said it has declared a state-of-emergency in the UK as the number of socially isolated older people reaches breaking point. 

A new study conducted by Qa Research reveals that almost one in five (19 per cent) of the older people Contact the Elderly supports joined the charity because they rarely saw another person. 

Contact the Elderly Founder and Chairman, Trevor Lyttleton MBE, said: 'Loneliness amongst older people has reached a state of emergency and must not be ignored. For almost 50 years we have been focussing on providing a cost-effective solution, yet the demand for our service has never been so high.

'We know our formula of tea and conversation works, but we simply cannot reach out to the people that desperately need our help without increased volunteers and funding.'

A spokesman for Bournemouth coroner's office said formal identification of the body had not taken place.

They said a post mortem examination will be attempted but it is highly unlikely to identify a cause of death.

It is thought they have been in contact with Mrs Leitrim's next of kin.

A spokesman from Dorset Police said the death is not being treated as suspicious.
