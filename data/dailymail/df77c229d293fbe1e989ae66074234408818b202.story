A plane travelling from Geneva to Manchester was diverted to Stansted due to an on-board medical emergency.

The Airbus landed at Stansted Airport shortly before 10.30pm last night, just under two hours after it set off from the Swiss airport.

The budget airline flight had been due to land at Manchester Airport at 11.45pm. The alarm was sounded as the plane flew over the English Channel and the pilot was forced into a rapid descent.

A spokesperson for the East of England Ambulance Service Trust said: 'The East of England Ambulance Service Trust was called to Stansted Airport last night (December 29) just after 10pm. 

'An ambulance crew, rapid response vehicle and a community first responder attended to help a female passenger who was taken ill. 

'She was conveyed to Broomfield Hospital for further assessment and care, but her condition isn’t thought to be life-threatening.' 

One passenger on board the flight, Samuel Hainsworth, tweeted: 'Must commend @easyJet staff on our flight home tonight. Dealt with the medical emergency & subsequent diversion to Stansted very professionally.
