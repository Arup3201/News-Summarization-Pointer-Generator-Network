Neil Warnock has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association for his post-match comments in the media about the performance of referee Craig Pawson during Crystal Palace's defeat at home to Chelsea.

Swansea manager Garry Monk has escaped a charge – at least for now – but has been ordered to explain his stinging verbal attack on referee Michael Oliver after his side lost at Stoke.

Warnock has until 6pm on Monday to respond to his charge, which revolves around claims that Pawson had not refereed from an 'even platform', allowing John Terry to escape a yellow card and then booking Damien Delaney for a similar offence. Delaney was later sent off.

'I thought he was influenced by one or two things,' said the Palace boss. 'John Terry's booking; If that's one of my players, it's a booking. I don't understand why it's not an even platform.'

The FA's disciplinary chiefs have examined interview footage this week and issued the charge today.

'It is alleged that Warnock's post-match comments constituted improper conduct in that they implied the match referee was motivated by bias; and/or brought the game into disrepute, in contravention of FA Rule E3[1],' said an FA statement.

He has a long history of disciplinary trouble with the authorities for his comments on referees but this is his first charge since returning to the touchline in August.

Monk fiercely criticised referee Oliver for a penalty decision during Swansea's 2-1 defeat Stoke. He has not been charged but has been asked to explain his comments and a charge could still follow.

Monk branded Oliver's penalty decision 'disgusting' and added: 'How he cannot see that's a blatant dive is beyond me'.
