A teenager has been found guilty of murdering a 15-year-old schoolmate, who he sexually assaulted and stabbed with a screwdriver so that he could sell his soul to the devil.

Jose Reyes, 18, was found guilty of capital murder by a jury in Harris County, Texas on Thursday afternoon and will automatically be sentenced to life in prison. Due to his age at the time of the alleged crime - 17 - he was not eligible for the death penalty.

He was accused of killing a 15-year-old schoolmate, Corriann Cervantes, with another male friend, Victor Alas, in an empty apartment in Clear Lake, Texas on February 4.

The girl was lured to the apartment by the duo but, after agreeing to have sex with them, she was allegedly strangled, bludgeoned and stabbed - and even had one of her eyes gouged out by the boys at part of a satanic ritual.

In court: Jose Reyes, 18, is pictured in court on Monday, charged with the capital murder of a 15-year-old girl who was found bludgeoned and strangled to death at an abandoned apartment in February

Details of the case were so graphic that members of the jury wept during opening statements on Monday. On Wednesday, the jury members were shown graphic autopsy pictures of the girl.

The Houston Chronicle reported that the images showed the right side of her face caved in after she was hit across the head with the porcelain lid of a toilet tank after she tried to run away.

'There were pieces of porcelain embedded in her face,' Assistant Harris County District Attorney John Jordan told jurors.

One of the girl's eyes were also gouged out with a plastic rod used to adjust window blinds, the Chronicle reported.

The photos were only seen by the jury, but some items, including the screwdriver Reyes allegedly stabbed her with, were on display in the courtroom 'and made some in the courtroom visibly upset', KHOU reported. 

It came after testimony showed that Cervantes and the two boys left a party where they were drinking alcohol, smoking marijuana and taking prescription pills to have sex.

Victim: Corriann Cervantes was found half naked with her clothes torn. Her body showed signs that she had been violently raped and there was an upside down cross carved into her flesh

Scene: Authorities say that after the boys lured Cervantes to a vacant apartment in southeast Houston (pictured) on February 5, they hit her with an ashtray, a toilet tank lid and a window blind rod

A witness said that the boys were holding up the girl as they left the party.

As the three had sex in the abandoned apartment, Alas began strangling her with a belt and Reyes stabbed with a screwdriver dozens of times in the face and torso.

Prosecutors say the two boys were hoping to make a deal with the devil when they disfigured the girl's body, including gouging one eye and carving an upside down crucifix on her stomach.

Reyes reportedly confessed to the horrific crime and said he had killed Corriann so that his younger friend could 'sell his soul to the devil,' according to KTRK-TV.

'Whether or not the devil was involved, what happened in that apartment was sadistic and inhumane,' Mr Jordan said. 'He said he had no regrets.' 

Haunting: Jose Reyes (pictured left in court and right in his mug shot) was charged as an adult in the heinous crime even though he was just 17 at the time. He will now be sentenced to life in prison

On trial: Reyes, in court on Monday, was turned in by his parents after he made 'some admissions' to them

Corriann was found in the empty flat three days after she was kidnapped. One of the neighbors who found her body said there were religious items placed around her.

A police report says she was found half naked with her clothes torn. Her body showed signs that she had been violently raped. 

'What happened in that vacant apartment was sadistic. What will eventually happen in the... courtroom will be justice,' Mr Jordan had said during the trial.

He added that Reyes' family went to authorities after the teenager made 'some admissions' to them about what had happened.

'They did the right thing. Clearly they were offended by his conduct,' he said.

At Reyes' home, 'there were some signs of devil worship and things of that nature,' Mr Jordan said.

Sick: Reyes confessed that the pair sexually assaulted Corriann. The duo allegedly strangled her with a belt, stabbed her repeatedly with a screwdriver and gouged out on of her eyes in the horrific attack

His former girlfriend, and the mother of his child, who was born in May 2013, also testified during the trial that she feared for his life when he spoke about the brutal killing.

Agapita Gonzales, who ived with Reyes and his family until she stopped seeing him romantically in February, told the court that she overheard him talking with his sister about an assault. 

'I just remember him talking about killing her,' Gonzales said. 'Corriann Cervantes.'

Prosecutors and the defense rested on Thursday and the jury returned with the verdict.

Alas also faces a capital murder charge as a juvenile.
