'Orange Is the New Black' actress Diane Guerrero broke down as she recounted the heartwrenching day she arrived home from school, aged 14, to discover her parents had been deported to Colombia.

Speaking to CNN on Monday, the 28-year-old actress recalled how she had returned to her Boston home after a day at school, excited to tell her family about being picked for a play.

'I got home and their cars were there and dinner was started and the lights were on, but I couldn't find them,' she told New Day. 

'I broke down. I remember I hid under the bed because I was afraid somebody would come for me.'

Struggle: Diane Guerrero, an actor in Orange Is the New Black, broke down during an interview with CNN on Monday as she recalled how her parents were deported to Colombia from Boston when she was 14

Left behind: The 28-year-old sobbed as she said how her parents missed out on her growing up

Guerrero, who was born in New Jersey and grew up in Boston, spoke to CNN two days after writing an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times calling for immigration reform so families don't get separated.

After she arrived home to an empty house, no government official contacted her to tell her where her parents were, she said.

'No one checked to see if I had a place to live or food to eat, and at 14, I found myself basically on my own,' she wrote.

Instead, neighbors told her what had happened and waited with her until her father was able to call from the detention center, she told CNN. Her parents were being held separately, she said, and her older brother, who had a young daughter at the time, had also been taken in by authorities.

Alone at 14, she relied on the kindness of other families to take her in, allowing her to attend a performing arts school and eventually go to college. 

Despite having places to stay and working a variety of jobs to do her best to support herself, she feared it could be taken from her at any point, she wrote in the LA Times.

'I had a rocky existence,' she explained. 'I was always insecure about being a nuisance and losing my invitation to stay.'

Her parents missed her recitals, her prom and her graduations from high school and college, she said. 

Despite the hurdles, she has achieved a successful acting career. She plays Maritza Ramos in Orange Is the New Black and the role of Lina in CW's new show, 'Jane the Virgin'.

She travels to see her family in Colombia once a year, she said - but their relationship has suffered.

'We've been separated for so long, I feel like sometimes we don't know each other,' she said, as she became emotional. 'I've grown up without them. There are things about them that I don't recognize.

'It hurts. I love them so much. I know that I've been by myself, but I feel like they have lived a very lonely existence themselves.' 

In her op-ed, she explained that her parents had moved to the U.S. during a time of 'great instability' in Colombia and had tried for years to get properly documented 'to no avail'.

Still, she considers herself lucky, she said. Her brother's daughter was raised in a single-parent household after he was taken away - and she is now serving time in jail.

'I don't believe her life would have turned out this way if her father and my parents had been here to guide and support her,' she wrote in Saturday's op-ed. 

Guerrero, a U.S. citizen who volunteers at the nonprofit Immigrant Legal Resource Center, is now calling on the Obama administration to change policies to ensure families are not separated. 

'I realize the issues are complicated,' she wrote. 'But it's not just in the interest of immigrants to fix the system: It's in the interest of all Americans.

'Children who grow up separated from their families often end up in foster care, or worse, in the juvenile justice system despite having parents who love them and would like to be able to care for them.

'I don't believe it reflects our values as a country to separate children and parents in this way.'
