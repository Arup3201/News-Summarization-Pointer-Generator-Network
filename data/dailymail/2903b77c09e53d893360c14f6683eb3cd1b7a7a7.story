Cate Edwards made sure everything at her wedding was just as her late mother would have wanted - and that included banning her father John Edwards' mistress from being a part of the ceremony.

The disgraced presidential candidate's daughter made it clear that Rielle Hunter was not welcome at her October 22 nuptials to college sweetheart Trevor Upham.

She did however say her father's love child Frances Quinn could share in the celebration, but the three-year-old was notably absent.

A source close to the family told the Enquirer: 'John had hoped that his two families could come together for this happy event.

'But the last thing Cate wanted on 
her wedding day was to see her father's mistress there - and she made it
very clear to him that Rielle was not welcome.

'Cate had no objections to Frances 
Quinn being there as she believes she is just an innocent child caught 
up in this tragedy, but she still hasn't forgiven Rielle for wrecking 
her family and destroying her mother.'

No invite: John Edwards' mistress Rielle Hunter was banned from the wedding but her daughter Frances Quinn was not

Miss Edwards married her surgical oncologist fianc√© at a 
local Methodist church in Chapel Hill, North Carolina - the ceremony 
taking place beside an altar which had been lit in her mother 
Elizabeth's memory after she died following a brave battle with breast 
cancer last December, aged 61.

According to the Enquirer, Elizabeth'
favourite flowers, foods and poems were a part of the big day as a way 
for her mother's spirit to be there as much as possible.

John Edwards walked his daughter down the aisle to the tune of Trumpet Voluntary. When the minister asked, 'Who gives this woman to be wed?', he answered: 'Her mother and I do.'

Cate - who wore a Monique Lhuillier dress - danced with Trevor to Wagon Wheel, the same song they danced to when they started dating, according to People magazine.

She then danced with her father to The Temptations' My Girl.

The source also told the magazine 
that Cate wants to have a baby as a tribute to her late mother and also 
to take the focus off her father's love child.

John 
Edwards, whose long-running affair hit the headlines while Elizabeth was
in the final stages of her battle with cancer, would be forgiven for 
having felt a tiny bit uncomfortable during the ceremony.

The initial plans were that he 
would at least walk her down the aisle, but it is not known if he gave his daughter away.

He avoided all the photographers - or attempted to at least - and was seen trying to make a
low-key exit via a back door of the venue.

Cate
has been a vocal supporter of her father, who faces felony charges of 
more than $1million in undisclosed payments allegedly paid to to cover 
up an affair, but it was clear that his scandal was not going to 
overshadow the wedding celebration.

His case will go to trial in January.

He faces a a 30-year jail sentence after he was indicted by a grand jury on six counts, including 
conspiracy, four counts of illegal campaign contributions and one count 
of false statements.

In a public address in June, with Cate by his side, he said he had 'done wrong' but has not broken the law.

The newlyweds looked delighted as 
they left the church arm in arm, and the wedding party then moved on to 
the nearby family home, where they hosted a reception on the lawn for 300 guests. they will honeymoon in Tahiti.

Before
the wedding Cate, 29, had spoken about her plans for the day, which she
discussed at length with her mother before she passed away earlier this
year.

'We want this to be really happy and 
joyous; that's what my mother would want,' she said. 'There are a lot of
sort of small ways that she's infused into the day.

Wedding: Cate was married on Saturday - less than a year after her mother died

Back door: While Cate left out of the front of the chapel, John tried to sneak out the back to avoid being seen

The attorney, who has left her job in May to start the 
Elizabeth Edwards Foundation, is the second-eldest of her parents' four children.

She said that she sees traces of her mother every day in younger sister Emma, 13, and brother Jack, 11.

Her older brother, Wade, tragically died at the age of 16 in a car accident in 1996.

Emma was her maid of honour on Saturday, while Jack was a groomsman.

'They had a tough year, but they're doing well,' Cate added.

Elizabeth Edwards' family members who visited Chapel Hill in North Carolina for the wedding celebrations also used it a an opportunity to visit her grave in nearby Raleigh.

But they were horrified when they arrived to find it had no formal headstone and only a small angel statue to mark her resting place beside her son Wade, who died in a tragic car accident aged 16 in 1996.

The source told the Enquirer: 'When Elizabeth's relatives discovered that her grave is still unmarked without a traditional headstone, they blamed John.

'He knew her family was coming to town for the wedding so they were baffled as to why he still hasn't honoured her memory. seeing her unmarked grave was a complete let down.'
