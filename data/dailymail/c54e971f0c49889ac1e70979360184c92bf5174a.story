However often the need for safety equipment is emphasised to cyclists, there are still those who cannot bear the thought of messing up their hair with a helmet.

But for those whose vanity has until now trumped concerns over possible death or traumatic head injuries, help is at hand.

Swedish engineers have invented an 
airbag that fits around cyclists' necks and inflates within a split 
second to completely envelop their heads and protect them from an 
impact.

Vanity need no longer be lethal: The Hövding bicycle airbag in action

Ouch! But at least this rider's delicate cranium is safe - and its vital contents

Here comes another one: Will these cyclists never learn?

Instantaneous: The Hövding collar is
fitted with sensors that can detect unusual body movements seconds 
before an accident and trigger the device before any damage can be done

High tech: Made from an ultra-strong nylon fabric, the 
Hovding takes about 0.1 seconds to inflate and can withstand several 
impacts, according to inventors Anna Haupt and Terese Alstin

Safe and sound: The stunt riders dust each other off

The Hövding collar is
fitted with sensors that can detect unusual body movements seconds 
before an accident and trigger the device before any damage can be done.

Made
from an ultra-strong nylon fabric, it takes about 0.1 seconds to 
inflate and can withstand several impacts, according to inventors Anna 
Haupt and Terese Alstin.

It
took the pair six years of research to bring their dream to fruition 
and they hope it could be this year's ultimate cycling fashion 
accessory. It costs £370 but the price is likely to fall if it is mass 
produced.

Ms Alstin said: 'We wanted to make a head protection for bicyclists based on the demands that was presented through our surveys.

'Among other things the protection should keep the sense of freedom that goes with bicycling and not ruin your hair.

'In our opinion the range of bicycle helmets available is extremely narrow, they all look the same and the lack of variety results in very few people wearing them.

'Hövding is the solution to the problem, it's subtle and blends in with what else you are wearing.'

So you might be innocently cycling along, with your tresses blowing in the breeze

When you suddenly, by accident, jam on your bicycle's front break

It looks as if an face-tarmac interaction is imminent - but luckily you are wearing your Hövding collar

The cyclist is safe, despite landing face-first on the road

Ms Hupt added: 'The actual collar is the visible part of the invention.

'It's covered by a removable shell that you can change to match your outfit, and we'll be launching new designs all the time.

'It is a practical accessory that's easy to carry around, it's got a great looking yet subtle design, and will save your life.'
