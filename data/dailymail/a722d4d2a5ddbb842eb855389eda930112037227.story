Jesus was the world's first tweeter because his sermons and messages were 'brief and full of meaning, a Vatican cardinal has claimed.

Gianfranco Ravasi made the comments while addressing a group of newspaper editors at a conference in Italy.

He said that Christ 'used tweets before everyone 
else, with elementary phrases made up of fewer than 45 characters such as 
'Love one another'.

Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, President of the Pontifical Council for Culture of the Vatican, made the claims during an Italian press conference

Cardinal Ravasi is the President of the Pontifical Council for Culture, the Vatican equivalent of a
culture minister.

He has his own Twitter account with around 56,000 followers.

He was making reference to the fact that the idea of Twitter and spreading news and messages to large numbers of people is not a new phenomenon, and Jesus was a pioneer.

He also linked Jesus to other modern-day technological development.

'A bit like in television today, [Jesus] delivered a message through a story or a symbol.'

Cardinal Ravasi also stated the church and clergymen should be doing all they can to take full advantage of the internet to get the message of God across to the masses.

touch with you through Twitter. Thank you for your generous response. I 
bless all of you from my heart.'

Pope Benedict also asked followers to send him questions about faith using the #AskPontifex hashtag.Â
