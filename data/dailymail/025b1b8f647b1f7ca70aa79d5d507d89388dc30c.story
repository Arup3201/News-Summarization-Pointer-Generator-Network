David Moyes is planning a world tour of football to refresh himself if the right job doesn’t come up in the next few months.

The former Manchester United manager, sacked after just ten months at United, has already had two offers from Premier League clubs and three from abroad – but is looking to return to a Champions League club.

Moyes is enthusiastic about the prospect of managing abroad if a good opportunity arises – but if not, he will use the time to broaden his horizons and travel to prepare himself for his next job.

‘I’m getting ready to work again,’ said Moyes. ‘I don’t know how I’ll be in a few weeks time when pre season starts. It’ll be the first time since I was 16 that I’m not starting a pre-season. But if a job doesn’t crop up which suits me, I’ll travel.

‘So many players come out of South America, I’d like to go and watch what they do. There’s more players from Brazil playing overseas than any other country and more in the Champions League than any nationality. So, there is a continual conveyer belt of them. Is it their development? Is the raw talent just better? And at the top level, any team you work for is going to have plenty of South Americans, so it would be good to understand the culture they’re from.

‘There’s got to be something to learn from youth development in South America, because if you get good young players you can build a club. You want to see where the good young players come from, their coaching and meet people involved in it - and that might help you sign them in the future.

‘I’d also like to go and look at the J-League. Places like Japan and Korea have emerging leagues and are producing more players and I’d like to see what they’re doing in that part of the world. They’re beginning to show signs of improving in talent development in a big way, as are the States. I’d just like to have a look around.’

Moyes, who was in Miami on holiday last week and took in England’s friendly match against Ecuador, says that he hopes his dismissal from Manchester United won’t stop major clubs from looking at British coaches again – and that he was even pleased by Brendan Rodgers’ success last season with Liverpool, because it demonstrated that home-grown coaches can thrive. 

‘The route through to the top for a British manager is a long process and maybe having a job abroad at some of the clubs and getting recognized for your work there, might be the way in the future,’ said Moyes. ‘But I hope I won’t be the last one to be given a chance to manage on of the top ones.

‘Brendan has come in and with the time he’s been given has been able to turn round Liverpool and I think it’s really important for British mangers that he’s done that.

'I’ve spent most of my career in rivalry with Liverpool but part of me was glad, because Brendan was given the opportunity to go in there and change things around and because of that Liverpool have got their strategy in place and a good future.’
