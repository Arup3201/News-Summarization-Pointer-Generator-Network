The family of an accounts manager who died when a branch fell on her during a three-year-old's birthday party have called on more research to stop people dying in similar circumstances

Erena Wilson from Hanwell, west London, was strolling through the picturesque Kew Gardens, Richmond, south west London, in September 2012 when she was hit by part of a Cedar of Lebanon tree.

After the inquest into the 31-year-old's tragic death, her parents Chris Wilson and Elizabeth Shelley paid tribute to their 'darling daughter' but called for more time to be spent analysing the risks of Summer Branch Drop to save lives in the future.

However, after the verdict of accidental death was recorded at West London Coroner's Court, staff at the gardens refuted the claim, insisting her death was a 'terrible freak accident'.

Outside the court, Pauline Giroux read out a statement on behalf of Ms Wilson's parents. In it they said: 'First, we would like to thank the jury for the time and consideration they have given to their considerations.

'Second, the loss of our darling daughter, Erena, shattered us as a family. Our memories of her are particularly vivid today, as the circumstances surrounding her death are brought to the fore.

'Our thoughts are not only with Erena but our hearts go out to all the families that have lost loved ones in similar circumstances.'

She was at Kew Gardens to celebrate the birthday of her friend Tess Marshall’s daughter Ruby, and an inquest heard it was pure 'fluke' that they too were not killed in the tragedy.

They have faced questions over the safety of its trees and whether it could have prevented the tragedy.

Richard Barley, director of horticulture, insisted that everything possible is done to ensure the safety of visitors to the gardens.

Speaking after the inquest, he said: 'The jury has found that there was no identifiable cause of branch failure from this tree that caused this tragic accident.

'We of course continue to extend our greatest sympathies of the family and friends of Ms Wilson.'

He dismissed calls for fencing to be put in place warning against summer branch drop, saying it would be 'inappropriate to place warning signs because it is such an unlikely thing to happen and it is so unforeseeable.'

John McLinden QC, representing Ms Wilson’s family, said it had been raining heavily in the hours leading up to the accident on September 23.

Tree branches are vulnerable to dropping off suddenly when they endure long dry spells followed by heavy rain in a condition known as 'Summer Branch Drop'.

Mr McLinden said Kew Gardens failed to put up signs warning of the danger because it deemed the risk so minimal, and questioned why it had not fenced trees off.

But Patrick Blakesley, a lawyer representing Kew, said the death was a 'terrible freak accident'.

After just 45 minutes of deliberation, the jury of four men and three women returned a verdict of accidental death.

The foreman told the court the jury found 'there is insufficient evidence to establish the cause of the branch failure'.

Defence: A lawyer representing Kew Gardens claimed her death was a 'terrible freak accident'

Ms Wilson was walking along a path in when Ms Marshall suddenly noticed a large Cedar of Lebanon branch, 20ft (6m) long and 12in (31cm) thick, was crashing down from 66ft (20m) above.

Ms Marshall screamed 'run' and fled for her life, but when she looked back she saw New Zealand-born Ms Wilson lying face-down on the ground surrounded by debris from the tree.

Ms Marshall had earlier told the four-day inquest that she heard a 'crack like lightning' and saw the thick branch fall.

She said: 'It blocked out the sky and all I could see was this umbrella of branches.

'As I was running I thought the whole tree was falling over. I was sure it was going to hit me. I was running away and then I heard a heavy thud. An ooomph.'

Argument: Staff at the picturesque gardens refuted claims it was Summer Branch Drop because of heavy rain before the incident

She spun around to see her friend motionless with blood coming out of her mouth and ears.

The branch fell with such force that it brought two others down in its wake and smashed Ms Wilson’s backpack, making 'sawdust' of the glass inside.

Ms Marshall said her young daughter had run ahead to walk with her aunt just moments earlier - but was in floods of tears at the sight.

She said: 'Because they had stopped and seen everything, my three year-old was really upset and crying so she went on with her auntie.'

Paramedics rushed to the scene, but Ms Wilson was pronounced dead at 2.51pm - after 45 minutes of cardiac resuscitation.

Experts at the Botanical Gardens, which is home to the world’s largest collection of living plants, said the tree had no sign of decay and was regularly inspected.

Tony Kirkham, head of arboretum at Kew, blamed the branch fall on a heavy downpour - 0.2in (5mm) of rain had fallen in the hour before the accident - and strong winds.

He said: 'I think the branch deluge was triggered by a wind squall. If we say that the wind gusted at 30mph, that would be strong enough to move branches.'

He dismissed suggestions that summer branch drop caused the accident, pointing out that it had been the wettest summer since records began and it happened later in the year.

He said Kew did all it could to care for the tree and that warning signs would have been an over-reaction.

But Jeremy Barrell, a tree expert called by the family, branded Kew’s system of tree inspection 'a shambles' and said 'this is definitely a case of Summer Branch Drop'.

He said the death could have been avoided if the tree, which was planted in 1730, had been pruned.

Assistant Coroner Elizabeth Pygott said the death was a 'ghastly accident' but she would not be making a Prevention of Future Deaths report.

Mr McLinden QC said Ms Wilson’s family wanted more to be done to raise awareness of the 'insidious danger' of summer branch drop.

Trees tend to shed their branches during a heatwave because they struggle to absorb water into their roots.

Even though the causes of Summer Branch Drop are not entirely clear, it is believed to be a common problem with trees that have longer limbs.

There is often a warning sign before a branch comes down which is said to sound like a 'sharp crack not unlike the sound of a shotgun going off'.

Paul Smith, who is a technical officer with the Arboricultural Association, told the website TreeSurgey.com: 'Certainly there’s a clear relationship between the weather conditions and the frequency of summer branch drop.

'It’s notoriously unpredictable so it’s very difficult from a tree owner’s point of view to meet their duty of care.'

Many trees throughout the country will show signs of 'stress' during periods of high temperatures, with their leaves turning yellow and even falling off.

While this might look like the tree is dying, it was a mechanism the tree uses to defend itself.

Trees will shed leaves and sometimes branches so there is less surface area for water to be lost.

A number of ways to combat tree branches dropping in heavily built up areas include watering them more often. However it is hard to distinguish how much water one tree needs and how often they should be watered.

In 2011, a 13-year-old girl died in a Peterborough park after a branch fell on her head.

Sophie Howard was with friends at a recreation ground in Yaxley while teachers at her school were on strike.
