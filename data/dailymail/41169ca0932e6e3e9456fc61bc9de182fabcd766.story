The Aussie cricket team are set to split a price pool of $5 million if they are to win the final against New Zealand tonight.

This will see the 15 man squad awarded with $340,000 each, regardless of how many games they played in the six week stint.

The AFR Weekend has reported that even George Bailey who only played one match against England in the tournament will receive the same amount as each other player. 

The Australian side are set to take home $340,000 each if they are triumphant in tonight's game against NZ

The winners divide the pool up evenly, regardless of how many games each participated in

Other occasional players such as Xavier Doherty, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Marsh will also be presented with the same cut.

The runner up pool is not too bad either with each player receiving $150,000 if they were to succumb to the New Zealand team.

This is on top of the player's contract payments, IPL contracts and individual endorsement deals. 

Other teams tend to divvy up the winnings in a different fashion.

If New Zealand were to win their prize money would be divided up by who participated in the most games

The Australian squad have 13 players in the top 50 sports earners in Australia, according to BRW

Australian cricketer Mitchell Johnston (2nd right) earned $4.1 million last year and is consequently one of Australia's top sports earners

New Zealand sees players who did not participate in all the games take home less of the prize pool than the players who did.

The Sydney Morning Herald have reported that these winnings may not make too much of a difference to the Australian squad members due to their ridiculously high earnings.

BRW recently released the Top 50 sports earners in Australia with 13 Australian cricketers making the cut. 

Shane Watson led the pack with an earning of $4.5 million last year, closely followed by Mitchell Johnston ($4.1 million) and Test captain Michael Clarke ($4 million).
