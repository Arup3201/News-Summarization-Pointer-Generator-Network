A girl of three who featured in ITV soap Emmerdale died from horrific burns after her dress caught fire in a freak accident.

Sophie Firth apparently leaned over a gas fire at her grandmother’s home and her clothes ignited.

Her mother Amy Harhoff, 28, tried to smother the flames with a blanket, but Sophie was severely injured, with 70 per cent of her body covered in burns.

Angelic: Sophie Firth, aged three, has died of organ failure after her dress was set alight by a gas fire

She was taken to Sheffield Children’s 
Hospital and transferred to the burns unit but lost her fight to stay 
alive on Tuesday – nine days after she was admitted.

Her family, including her father 
Neil, a project manager for Doncaster Council, and Amy, a traffic 
planner for the council, were with her when she died.

They issued a statement telling of 
their devastation at losing their ‘bright and beautiful’ little girl. 
Sophie also had a one-year-old brother.

She appeared in Emmerdale for three months in 2009 as Angelica, baby of Jimmy and Nicola King.

The family had been living at the 
grandmother’s home in Skellow, Doncaster, while renovation work was 
being carried out on their home in Austerfield, Doncaster.

She was due to appear in a nativity play at her nursery school next week.

The fatal accident happened at the family home in Skellow, South Yorkshire on December 2.

Heart-breaking: Sophie's parents described her as a 'little princess' after her death

After catching fire, her mother Amy 
Harhoff, 28, desperately tried to to save the girl by smothering her in a
 blanket as family members called for fire and ambulance services.

The
 house, where the three-year-old's family was living while their own 
home nearby was being renovated, was not damaged by the fire.

Sophie was taken to hospital in Sheffield for treatment to her 70 per cent burns and was later transferred to a specialist unit in Newcastle.

She was given a skin graft last Friday, but her organs began to fail after she developed a blood infection.

Her parents, who both work for Doncaster Council, were at her side when she passed away.

They have spoken of their devastation at losing their 'beautiful little girl' and say they will 'carry their little princess in their arms forever'.

Sophie's brother, George, turns one year old today.

Soon after she was born, Sophie was 
on the cast of Emmerdale for three months from August 2009 playing 
Angelica King, before being replaced by Rebecca Bakes.

Home: Sophie was injured at her grandmother's house in Skellow, South Yorkshire on December 2

In
 the soap, Angelica was born prematurely and suffered from breathing 
problems. After being released from intensive care, she was kidnapped by
 her aunt Lexi, who was upset at her inability to have a child, and held
 hostage on the roof of the hospital.

'We are devastated to hear of Sophie's tragic death,' a spokesman for the programme said. 'Our sincere condolences go out to her family. Everyone at Emmerdale is thinking of them at this sad time.'

Sophie's uncle Mick Harhoff paid tribute to his 'beautiful niece' and said the family would never get over the loss.

'Sophie was such a lovely little girl and she was exceptionally bright,' he said. 'She always used to say that she wanted to be a princess.

'You do expect that one day you may bury your parents but you never expect to bury a child.'

A spokesman for South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue said: 'This was a tragic accident and our thoughts are with the girl’s family and friends at this extremely distressing time.

'Any fire can be dangerous. We would urge people to pay particular attention to the risk of fires in their home during the cold weather and as we approach the holiday season.'
