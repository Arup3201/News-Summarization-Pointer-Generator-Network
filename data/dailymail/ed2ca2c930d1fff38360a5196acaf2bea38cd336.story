It's a case of spot the difference between Australia's poster promoting the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup and the other competing countries.

The 'I root for' slogan is emblazoned across the other 23 teams' promotional material but Australia's poster was wisely changed to 'I support Australia' for the World Cup championship that runs for the next two weeks in Spain.

Although 'rooting' is a term widely used across the globe to imply you support or follow a particular team or country in sport, the word is more commonly used as a slang word among Aussies for having sex. 

Using the word 'support' was the better option for Australia instead of 'root' like the other 23 posters

Americans very commonly used the term 'root' to talk about their support for a team

The change was made after Basketball Australia suggested FIBA alter the marketing material in question to suit the Australian market.

'Given the connotations of the original slogan – we think basketball is exciting enough as it is without other activities on top,' a Basketball Australian spokesperson said.

The alteration of the poster started a debate on Reddit with some thinking the Aussie term should have been changed to 'barrack'.

'If they understood Australian slang it would be 'I barack (sic) for Australia' one said.

Another replied suggesting that 'barrack' was only a Victorian term while others chimed in saying the word was also used in NSW, Perth and Adelaide.

Then the conversation went onto whether barrack was used across the country

Then someone suggested it was an old-fashioned term: 'I've heard it rarely and it was mostly other people saying it'. 

'I think it's Australia wide....but is slowly falling out of fashion an some areas are just hanging onto it longer,' another posted. 

But others thought 'barrack' was only used in the football code of AFL which was originally known as the VFL and only played in Victoria.

'I have a suspicion it's just an AFL thing. I've never heard someone say they barrack for their team unless they're talking about Vickers.'

New Zealand don't seem to have a problem with using the 'I root' slogan

Some suggested that 'barrack' was just possibly an AFL term

Others thought it was simply an old-fashioned word that was dying out
