A high-rolling poker player dubbed ‘The Don’ was jailed for seven years yesterday for duping two banks in a £750million fraud during the property boom.

Flamboyant fraudster Achilleas Kallakis, 44, conned lenders into advancing enormous loans to buy 16 landmark properties across the UK.

The nephew of a Greek shipping magnate teamed up with ‘prolific forger’ Alexander Williams, also 44, to swindle the Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Scotland. 

From 2003 to 2008 the pair used forged documents, sham legal letters and bogus guarantees to mislead the banks, which eventually lost £60million when the scam collapsed.

Among the buildings was Lunar House, 
the Home Office’s asylum processing centre in Croydon, bought for 
£100million, the headquarters of the Daily Telegraph in Central London 
for £225million, and a 23-storey building in Vauxhall, South London, for
 £75million.

Jailing the pair at Southwark Crown 
Court, Judge Andrew Goymer said it ‘beggars belief’ senior bank managers
 ignored warnings from lawyers over the men.

He said the two institutions ‘acted carelessly and imprudently’.

The pair’s fake guarantees led to 
increased valuations and generated a £77million surplus, while a further
 £114million was put up by AIB.

They also duped the Bank of Scotland into parting with £26million in 2007 for the conversion of a ferry into a luxury yacht.

Kallakis, of Chelsea, was jailed for seven years and Williams, of Fulham, for five.

They were found guilty of 21 charges including conspiracy to defraud, forgery and money laundering.

Kallakis, a father of four, claimed to be a San Marino ambassador.

As a poker player in the US, he once won a million dollars in a game.

He also owned property in Greece and Monaco.

The pair were convicted in the 1990s 
of selling bogus peerage titles to wealthy Americans. Williams was also 
convicted in 1993 of using the names of dead people to obtain British 
passports.

Jailing Kallakis for seven years and Williams for five years, Judge Andrew Goymer said: 'Achilleas Kallakis I regard you as the prime mover in this fraud you had the experience of the property market and you also had the accumulated wealth.

'Alexander Williams you had a lesser role but by no means an insignificant one.

'You were involved in the production and control of the documents that allowed it.'

Both men were disqualified from acting as company directors for six years.

Achilleas Kallakis gave himself the nickname 'The Don' and enjoyed high-stakes poker games

Kallakis, the nephew of Greek shipping
 magnate Pantelis 'Lou' Kollakis, said he wanted to turn property worth 
£120m, between Piccadilly and Pall Mall in St James Square, into the 
world's most expensive penthouse.

Father-of-four
 Kallakis, who called himself 'his excellency' and claimed to be a San 
Marino ambassador, bought a private jet for £27m, a helicopter for 
£5.2m, a luxury yacht moored in Monaco harbour and a collection of high 
value art works.

He owned a fleet of chauffer driven Bentleys, a villa in Mykonos and property in Brompton Square, Chelsea, and Monaco, where he is said to have been a member of Prince Albert's charitable foundation.

Kallakis
 and Williams used forged documents including bogus guarantees from Hong
 Kong based property developer SHKP and sham letters attesting to their 
wealth to rip off the banks.

The Home Office building, Lunar House, in Croydon, south London, was one of the commercial properties Kallakis bought through fraudulent bank loans

The
 fake guarantees, said to cover the rental income from the buildings, 
led to increased valuations and generated a £77m surplus.

A
 further £114m put up by AIB and due to be paid in in reverse premiums -
 incentives for SHKP - was also plundered by Kallakis and Williams.

When the scam collapsed the banks lost a total of nearly £60m.

Following a retrial lasting almost four months both men were found guilty of two charges of conspiracy to defraud.

Kallakis and Williams were convicted in 1995 of selling bogus titles to wealthy Americans including current US congressman for the Louisiana 7th District, Charles Boustany.

Their victims were attracted by the ultimate step in upward mobility and believed they would receive priority on the Queen's social list.

Police then tracked the pair, who travelled by Concorde, through their BA Airmiles. They were fined and sentenced to 160 hours of community service.

Both Kallakis and Williams changed their names after the peerage fraud - Kallakis was formerly known as Stefanos Kollakis, while Alexander was previously called Martin Lewis.

Williams had also been convicted in February 1993 of using the names of dead people to obtain British passports.

Prosecutor Victor Temple QC said the two men - with Swiss lawyer Michael Becker, who was not before the court, targeted AIB and the Bank of Scotland in a 'large scale financial fraud'.

He said they had persuaded AIB by 'dishonest means, which included the production of forged documents' to advance monies in respect of the purchase the 16 properties between 2003 and 2008'.

'In all cases the money, some £740m in total, was advanced by AIB to companies directly or indirectly under the defendants' control,' he said.

'The ultimate loss to AIB was in excess of £56m.'

The Telegraph Media Group headquarters on Buckingham Palace Road was bought for a reported £225million by Kallakis

Kallakis and Williams duped the Bank of Scotland into parting with millions in 2007 for the proposed conversion of an ex-passenger ferry into a luxury yacht.

'Dishonest means, again involving forged documentation, were used by the three to secure a loan in the sum of £26m,' said Mr Temple.

'The ultimate loss to the bank was approximately £5.8m.'

'The two men used forged deeds of guarantee they claimed had been signed by the bosses of Sun Hung Kai Properties coupled with forged board minutes to convince AIB to loan the money.

They also provided sham accounts for a company called Oregon Finance Corporation which 'purported to show profit on a massive scale'.

Mr Temple said: 'Oregon was worthless, built on straw.'

They
 used a similar deception to trick Bank of Scotland, providing a 
worthless guarantee from Oregon, based on forged account sheets and a 
death certificate of Kallakis's mother in which her surname had been 
altered to hide Kallakis's name change.

Kallakis
 had been the 'frontman' in negotiations with the Bank of Scotland and 
used his 'forceful' personality to steamroller the bank into paying out 
the loan.

He said: 
'Kallakis knew very well that just like AIB the Bank of Scotland were 
keen to do a deal and, in particular, he knew very well that just as AIB
 wanted to develop their property book so to the Bank of Scotland wished
 to develop their marine book.'

Judge Andrew Goymer jailed Achilleas Kallakis for seven years at Southwark Crown Court today describing him as 'the primer mover' in the fraud

Kallakis claimed he had run a 'genuine business' and had never misled the banks.

He blasted AIB, branding the bank 'greedy rats' and claiming its forced sale of his property portfolio to Stephen Vernon's Green Property group a ploy to steal his assets.

He said: 'They manipulated the situation and they took the assets knowing they were going to not pay us what we were rightfully due.'

George Carter-Stephenson QC, defending Kallakis, said: 'One has to wonder whether there was ever an intended loss, i.e. whether the defendants ever thought there would be a loss to the bank, given that these transactions were taking place during the course of what may be described as a major property boom when nobody saw an end to it and the events of 2008 took many bankers as well as ordinary people by surprise.'

Kallakis, of Brompton Square, Chelsea, and Williams of Epirus Road, Fulham, both south west London, were convicted of two counts of conspiracy to defraud.

The jury were discharged from returning verdicts on 19 further counts including forgery, fraud, money laundering and obtaining a money transfer by deception.

After the case, Serious Fraud Office case manager Ronan Duff said: 'This was an audacious, persistent fraud that enabled these defendants, Mr Kallakis in particular, to lead the lifestyle of the super-rich.

'The SFO have been equally persistent in investigating this elaborate scam and in ensuring that justice has been delivered'.

Both will now face confiscation proceedings to try and recover some of the money lost.
