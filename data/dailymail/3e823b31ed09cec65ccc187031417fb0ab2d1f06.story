Her curves are the envy of women worldwide and she regularly tops best body polls, so it is fair to say that Kim Kardashian looks good in almost anything that she wears.

And it seems that age isn't a barrier to Kim's stylish status, with presenter Arlene Phillips taking wardrobe inspiration from the curvy reality TV star.

There may be nearly 40 years between them but 70-year-old Arlene gave Kim, 32, a 
run for her money in the style stakes when she stepped out wearing an identical dress to one previously worn by the new mother.

Clearly keen to prove that age is just a 
number, Arlene looked half her age in the figure-skimming red dress.

The TV presenter donned her dress last night at ITV's annual summer party.

She teamed it with a pair of sky scraper Louboutin heels and a black Chanel clutch bag.

Kim was ahead of the game though and packed her famous derriere into the tight fitting dress on the Lorraine show in London back in November last year.

She teamed the raunchy frock with a pair of cream colour heels and a black clutch bag.

And not only did Kim wear her version of the dress, she designed it too: the £40 plunging dress was from the Kardashian Kollection clothing line at Dorothy Perkins.

Arlene, who became a household name as the choreographer and director of Seventies dance troupe Hot Gossip, has openly admitted to turning back time with the help of Botox.

She sparked a national ageism debate in 2009 when Alesha Dixon- who is half her age- took her place on Strictly Come Dancing.

At the time she told Good Housekeeping magazine that she 'probably would' have Botox again.

She said: 'Every time I'm about to do a TV thing, I think: "You know, I could just have..." If something works, go and do it is what I think.

'I have this real good facial treatment with revolving massagers from Spain called Indiba. I'm one of those people who will read a magazine and if it's not too pricey, I'll try it.'

The TV star has regular oxygen facials and a 
monthly skin-firming light and radio frequency treatment called Sublime 
at the Skin Associates in Harley Street, and uses a variety of miracle 
creams sourced by her daughter Alana, a make-up artist.

She recently spoke out about reaching her seventieth birthday, saying: ‘I never get depressed about how old I 
am because there’s nothing you can do about it.

'You can’t go backwards, 
so you have to embrace it, which is why I had a party and, my goodness, 
it was fantastic.’
