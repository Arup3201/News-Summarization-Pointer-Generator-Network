Fifty years ago, a teenage boy ran away from home to join the circus. A note he left for his stockbroker parents read: 'Please do not under any circumstances try to find me. I have gone.'

That 15-year-old was Gerry Cottle, who would rise from fledgling juggler to a legendary showman and become synonymous with the world of the circus.

Now, to celebrate 50 years in showbusiness, the renowned Gerry Cottle's Circus has been brought back for one last time with the spectacular 50 Acts In 100 Minutes - including Chico and Ernesto, the blindfolded high-wire walkers; Mad Max Norton the crossbow champion; Boneless Boy; and Bippo the clown.

Mr Cottle established his eponymous Big Top in 1974 and ran it until 2003, at which point he retired and bought tourist attraction Wookey Hole in Somerset.

The show, which runs until July 23, has embarked on a national tour with its final performance in St Austell, Cornwall.

And its particular brand of entertainment is a reflection of the love Mr Cottle has for an industry he was enchanted by since the age of eight - when he sat wide-eyed during a visit to Jack Hilton's Circus in Earl's Court, west London.

After later running away from his south-west London home, he became an apprentice at the Roberts Brothers’ Circus, where he trained as a juggler.

One year later, in 1962, he learned more of the business side of the operation with Joe Gandey's Circus. There, he also honed his skills in tenting, clowning and animal grooming.

With years of experience, an eye for stunts, canny marketing and a gift for showmanship, Mr Cottle's Big Top was a huge success

Billed as Gerry Melville the Teenage Juggler, he starred in a number of shows over the next eight years - and in 1968, he married Betty Fossett, the youngest daughter of circus showman Jim Fossett

By 1970, circuses had fallen out of fashion - major touring shows by Smart and Mills, for example, were no longer a popular attraction.

In spite of this, Mr Cottle made the decision that was to set him on the path to success and, four years later, Gerry Cottle's Circus was born.

With years of experience, an eye for stunts, canny marketing and a gift for showmanship, his Big Top was a huge success.

By 1976, he was running two shows, which gave rise to several permutations: Gerry Cottle’s Circus, 
Cottle and Austen’s Circus on Ice, Cottle and Austen’s 'London Festival'
Circus and Gerry Cottle’s New Circus.

At its peak, his arenas seated 1,500 and required 150 truck to transport the show.

However, the 1980s saw a growing backlash by the public against the use of animals in circus acts.

Although he won a case against Edinburgh Council regarding the use of wild animals in his shows, he sold his last elephant by 1993 and toured with a non-animal circus.

In the mid-1990s, he also managed the Moscow State Circus and Chinese State Circus.

Cottle’s
most radical departure came in 1995 when he launched the Circus of
Horrors at Glastonbury, inspired by 
French circus Archaos.

In 
2003, Gerry Cottle decided to retire from the travelling entertainment world and 
bought Wookey Hole in Somerset, transforming it into a mixed 
entertainment complex including a circus museum, daily circus shows and other attractions.

Gerry Cottle told Money Mail that he got £6 a week for working as a clown when he started out

In 2006, Gerry Cottle was interviewed by Money Mail...

HOW MUCH WAS IN YOUR FIRST WAGE PACKET? I got £6 a week as a clown when I started in 1961. The next year, when I had picked up some juggling skills, I was on £9 a week. I had the same contract with a few new figures scribbled over the top of the old ones. This was in the days of 'no play, no pay'. So if a show was cancelled because bad weather had ruined the ground - which was quite common - it meant starving or making sure you had saved a bit from the week before.

WHAT WAS YOUR BEST FINANCIAL MOVE? Twice I've bought farms that have turned into big money later on. My best move was buying a farm in Surrey as the winter HQ for the circus for £40,000. We lived there for 30 years and sold it for £3m. The M25 had not been built when we arrived there in 1975.

AND YOUR WORST? Taking the circus to Iran during the revolution in 1979. We'd been booked by the general of the Iranian army and were not paid the promised deposit. We'd already booked the acts, including ice-skating chimps from Italy, and loaded our equipment on the boats when I realised. There was a 6pm curfew which meant no one was allowed to leave their homes. We never got paid, ran out of money and had to do a midnight flit from our hotel. The debts bankrupted me.

HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR YOUR FIRST HOME? I bought a converted ambulance when I was 17. It cost £17.50 but I had terrible trouble getting it insured because I was so young and in showbusiness. I shared it with an Indian chair balancer called Billy Gunga. The only peace I got was when he fell in love with a fish and chip shop owner in Brighton and would go and visit her. My first non-mobile home was the farm I mentioned earlier.

HOW MANY CREDIT CARDS ARE IN YOUR WALLET? Two. One personal and one for business use for my spooky caves attraction, Wookey Hole in Somerset.

DO YOU PREFER TO PAY BY CASH OR CARD? Cash, definitely. I used to buy everything with cash and still like to now if I can. I love an auction.

HOW MUCH CASH DO YOU HAVE IN YOUR WALLET? A couple of hundred pounds most of the time.

HOW ARE YOU SAVING FOR YOUR RETIREMENT? I never really want to retire. I've given up on pensions as I believe they are grey-suited robbers. I've lost a lot of money over the years. If I had relied on my pension I would be in financial difficulty now. Continuing to work and invest in my business paid off for me. My main investment is Wookey Hole. I have a five-year plan which includes building a hotel in a couple of years.

WHAT WAS YOUR MOST INDULGENT PURCHASE? The world's biggest caravan. It cost £20,000 in 1976, which is equivalent to about £200,000 now. It was 55ft long and had seven rooms - I wanted everyone in the family to have their own room. It was over-indulgent not only because of the price, which was crazy for a caravan in those days, but also because it was a nightmare to travel around in. It couldn't even fit through most park gates. I've caused a few traffic jams in my time. I also bought the world's longest car - a 75ft Cadillac with full-size Jacuzzi. It was too long to drive and in the end I just put it on a trailer to showcase it.

WHAT WAS THE BIGGEST TIP YOU'VE EVER GIVEN? I gave $1,000 once in America when I was buying a caravan - but it was a mistake. I'd just arrived from Hong Kong and was still thinking in Hong Kong dollars. I thought the tip was about £100 but it was actually more than £400. Another time I gave four Shetland ponies to an Irish circus family who were buying horses from us. It was a goodwill gesture which made a real bond between our families. I still get invited to stay with them whenever I am in Ireland.

AND THE BEST TIP YOU'VE EVER BEEN GIVEN? An old circus boss taught me very young that when negotiating a deal you should let the other side offer first as very often it's less than you imagine. Often a farmer renting a field will suggest a lower amount than you thought he'd want. Ken Dodd also told me to 'follow the big boys'. He meant watch what the big entertainment companies such as Disney did, even down to the colour of their costumes. They've spent millions on research and marketing so they must know what they are doing.
