Cannabis does not slow the progression of multiple sclerosis, a large-scale study has concluded.

The study at the Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry at Plymouth University is a blow to hopes that the drug could provide long-term benefits for patients with the debilitating nerve disease.

Despite promising signs in earlier, shorter studies, researchers found patients who took capsules containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a key active ingredient in cannabis, fared no better than those given a placebo.

Damning research: Cannabis does not slow the progression of multiple sclerosis, a large-scale study has concluded

The trial involved 493 people with progressive MS at 27 centres around the UK and began in 2006. Participants took either THC capsules or placebo for three years.

In the study known as Cupid - cannabinoid use in progressive inflammatory brain disease - MS patients were assessed on both a disability scale administered by neurologists and another based on their own reporting.

Lead researcher John Zajicek said: 'Overall the study found no evidence to support an effect of THC on MS progression in either of the main outcomes.'

The results from the study, which was funded by the Medical Research Council, were presented at the Association of British Neurologists' annual meeting in Brighton today.

Cannabis contains more than 60 different cannabinoids, of which THC is thought to be the most active, and many MS patients have long said the drug helps them cope with the effects of the disease.

Drug companies, too, have been interested in cannabis as a medicine.

Soon after he turned 40, Stephen, from Suffolk, was diagnosed with MS. Some five years later, separated from his wife, wheelchair-bound and re-housed in a bungalow, he was put on cannabis-based drug Sativex.

‘So far I’ve taken it for six months. It looks like a breath freshener. I spray one burst under my tongue up to 15 times a day, from half an hour before I get up to just before I go to bed. It is alcohol-based, tastes unpleasantly bitter and is absorbed through the mouth’s lining within 30 minutes.

‘It gives me relief from pain so I can relax or focus enough to make decisions. Though I’m in a wheelchair, it’s nothing like the limitations caused by continual intense pain. In fact, it’s been so effective that I’ve stopped using painkillers.

‘Cannabis has given me back my quality of life. It has aided my sleep, which means I am less irritable and depressed. It has improved my eyesight and allows me to control my bladder and bowel more easily.

‘I’ve been able to sit at a computer and use voice-activated software. Because it relaxes the body, it reduces the spasticity so I can even use an exercise bike.

‘Because of Sativex, I’m able to walk Oscar the dog in my wheelchair twice a day.’

GW Pharmaceuticals, working with Bayer and Almirall, recently started selling an under-the-tongue cannabis spray called Sativex to relieve spasticity..

David Nutt, professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the latest research, said the study's failure did not mean cannabis had no role in helping MS patients.

He said: 'It would be wrong to interpret these preliminary findings to mean that cannabis does not achieve its licensed use.

'Cannabis is not licensed for limiting disease progression, it is licensed for dealing with spasticity and pain.'

Professor Zajicek's study did find some evidence to suggest a beneficial effect in less disabled patients, but because this was seen in only a small group of people it was unclear how strong the effect was.

The overall study population also experienced slower disease progression than had been expected, making it more challenging to detect any treatment effect, the researchers added.

MS is a disease in which immune system cells destroy the myelin sheath that protects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.

The most common type is relapsing remitting MS, affecting around 85 per cent of patients at the time of diagnosis.

Several drugs are available to treat this stage of the disease, including injections of beta-interferons and a new pill from Novartis called Gilenya.

Secondary progressive MS comes later and involves a sustained build up of disability.
