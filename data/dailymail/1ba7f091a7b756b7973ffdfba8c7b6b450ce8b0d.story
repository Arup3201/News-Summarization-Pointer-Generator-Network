An Orthodox Jewish mother, who has battled for years to obtain a religious divorce from her husband, wept on the stand in court on Thursday as she accused him of rape and abuse.

Rivky Stein, 25, took the stand at Brooklyn Supreme Court, New York, as she claimed she has been unable to move forward with her life because her estranged husband, Yoel Weiss, 33, refused to give her a 'get' - a divorce under Orthodox Jewish law.

Ms Stein testified that after she married Weiss at the age of 18, he raped her, punched her in the stomach when she was pregnant and locked her outside the home in the freezing cold.

She also told the court that her husband starved her and their two young children.

The civil case which began this week will determine the custody of the couple's children, child support payments and alimony for Ms Stein. 

Yoel Weiss, at court on Wednesday, was reprimanded by the judge as he laughed when his ex-wife testified about being raped and beaten

Ms Stein's attorney Michael Stutman, head of the family practice at Mishcon de Reya, said: 'We are fighting for our clients right to raise her children, not live in fear and find the happiness that she deserves.'

In an interview with Daily Mail Online last June, Ms Stein described the years of physical torture and mind games she said she had endured in her fight to free herself as an 'Agunah' - chained wife - from the bonds of their religious marriage.

Rivky claimed on her wedding night as a naive teenager that Weiss, the ‘charming and spiritual’ man she believed she had married, was a violent and malevolent force who took pleasure in watching her suffer.

'The night of the wedding, he made it clear that he owned me and that night he forced himself on me,' she testified before the court on Thursday. 

'I didn’t even know what happened. I felt stuck. I had nowhere to go back to', The New York Post reported.   

Ms Stein has spoken out about her struggle to be freed from her marriage in a deeply religious world where women often have little control and powerful rabbis have the final say.

She testified this week that she had approached rabbis about the physical abuse by her husband, adding: 'I would ask them what I should do and if I had permission to call the police.

'They told me that I can’t. They wouldn’t give me permission to.' 

Weiss laughed as his estranged wife testified on Thursday, the Post reported, prompting harsh words from Judge Esther Morgenstern.

Judge Morgenstern had trouble getting her own get from her ex-husband in the late 1980s when she was 27 years old, according to reports. 

The judge has put pressure on Weiss to give his former wife the get. Receiving a get will allow Ms Stein to remarry in the Jewish faith.

During proceedings, Weiss' attorney said there was no proof of abuse.

But Ms Stein told a very different story during a lengthy interview last June. She spoke from a cramped, basement apartment with five locks on the door that she had been forced to move into with her children to escape her marriage.

She said the marriage was one of fear and control with Weiss monitoring her every move, she claimed. 

She said: ‘I didn’t have anywhere to go back to. He had cut me off from my family and my friends. He monitored my phone. Everything was controlled, I couldn’t reach out to family and I was also ashamed. And I was scared what he would do.

‘So I thought, that’s it, I’m screwed, this is what I have to deal with now. And that all started from the beginning.’

She told Daily Mail Online: ‘If I ever wanted to leave the house, I had to ask him permission. I had to say where, when, exactly what time I would be back. If I was to go out, it would be with a family member of his.

‘Once my children came, if I went out, he usually held one of my children or both of them as an assurance that I would come back. Everything was extremely monitored and controlled.

‘The punishments were all the time. He locked me into rooms until he decided I could come out. Constant emotional and sexual abuse. Everything was to exert his control over me.'

It wasn't until the summer of 2012 that Rivky found a window of opportunity for her and her two young children to flee.

She obtained an order of protection from the court - an order which Weiss has violated and been arrested for five times.

Weiss claims the complaints filed by Rivky were false. He says he was never jailed.

He told MailOnline that he is prepared to give Ms Stein her get but that she was unwilling to settle on child custody issues or drop her order of protection.

'She's the mother of my children,' Weiss told MailOnline. 'But she's willing to fabricate anything. If something took place, I'd be in jail.'
