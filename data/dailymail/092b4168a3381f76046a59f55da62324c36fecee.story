Nearly a quarter of a million more tourists flocked to the UK in March compared to last year - thanks to the mild weather.

As well as the number of overseas visitors soaring by 230,000, travellers also spent £40m more while they were visiting the country.

Foreign residents made 2.41 million trips to the UK in March compared with 2.18 million in the same month last year - the coldest March in the UK for 50 years.

Mild weather: 230,000 more tourists visited the UK - including London - this March compared to last year

During their 2014 trips, these overseas visitors spent £1.34bn - a rise on the £1.3bn of March 2013, the Office for National Statistics said.

The latest figures took the number of visits by overseas residents to the UK for the first three months of this year to 6.99 million - a 10 per cent rise on the January-March 2013 total.

Their spending for the first three months of this year is up 19 per cent to £4.26bn.

This follows a record year in 2013 when overseas visitor spending passed the £20bn mark for the first time.

In contrast, UK residents are making fewer visits abroad and spending less when they get there, despite a big rise in the number of Britons visiting the US where the pound is at a five-year high against the US dollar.

UK residents made 3.44 million visits abroad in March 2014 compared with nearly 3.52 million in March 2013.

Spending during those foreign trips slipped from £2.14bn in March 2013 to £1.88bn in March 2014.

Spending by UK residents during foreign trips in the first three months of this year has totalled £5.55bn - down 8 per cent on the same period last year.

Seemingly aware of the good pound-dollar rate at present, Britons made 24 per cent more trips to North America in the first three months of this year than in January-March 2013.
