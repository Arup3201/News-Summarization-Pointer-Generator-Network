A drama about comedian Tommy Cooper's life, set to air tomorrow, has appalled his daughter Vicky Cooper who has branded the film 'all lies'.

The film titled Not Like That, Like This, will be shown on ITV  tomorrow from 9pm and will feature actors including David Threlfall, of Shameless fame, Harry Potter actress Helen McCrory and New Tricks star Amanda Redman.

But the day before the film, which will expose Cooper as an abuser and a drunk, is set to be watched by millions across the country, Ms Cooper has said that her father would be 'disgusted'.

The timing of the film will tie in with the 30th anniversary of the comedian's death but, far from a tribute to one of the Queen's favourite performers, it will claim that Mr Cooper was a drunk and a domestic abuser.

Cooper died of a heart attack live on stage in front of millions of 
viewers, during a performance on the London Weekend Television variety 
show at Her Majesty’s Theatre in 1984, aged just 63.

The two-hour production focuses almost entirely on his affair with his assistant Mary Fieldhouse known as Mary Kay.

His daughter has criticised ITV for not allowing her to have a full input in the production process.

She told The Sunday Mirror that she wanted to meet the producers but that she was barred from discussions about the script.

The claims come after its writer Simon Nye said that Ms Cooper had approved of the script. He said: ‘We were anxious, but she was very nice about it.’

Ms Cooper argues that her father would not have been such a well-respected and adored figure if the film's content was true.

A trailer of the ITV drama, see below, shows Cooper drinking heavily and hitting his wife after she confronts him about an affair.

Another scene shows Ms Fieldhouse with a bruised cheek, but the comedian's daughter said that she never saw her father 'lay a finger on anyone' - although she admitted that her father had a 'terrible temper'.

The drama was filmed in the family's former home in Chiswick which Ms Cooper said was 'insensitive'.

She said the house was a place of cherished memories.

The film suggests that Cooper's wife Gwen Cooper knew about the affair with Ms Fieldhouse.

His daughter said that the depiction is inaccurate because her mother only found out about the affair once Ms Fieldhouse's book For The Love of Tommy was published in 1986.

In the film, Gwen Cooper also smokes, which Ms Cooper has said is another error because her mother stopped smoking when she was diagnosed with tuberculosis and was left with one lung.

And although the drama focuses on Cooper's mistress, again, his daughter claims this is not a faithful representation of his life because the woman was 'just a fill-in'.

Writer, Simon Nye has defended the drama, refuting claims that it is a disrespectful portrayal of the late Cooper.

He said it was fair to include the domestic violence scenes because they were 'on record' but he added that 'I hope that we did it in a delicate way.'

He added: 'You don’t want people who don’t know Tommy’s comedy to go away thinking he was a wife-beater.

'But he was physical, and he was physical with his wife, who gave as good as she got.'

The flaws in Cooper's character were first revealed in 2011 when extracts from the diaries of Cooper’s agent Miff Ferrie were published.

The diaries, which form the basis of much of the ITV film, revealed how in 1969 Ferrie took a call from Gwen Cooper, saying she was leaving her husband because he had hit her in front of the children.

In 1973, Ferrie wrote: ‘She is divorcing him . . . he keeps beating her . . . I spoke to [Tommy] who said she must be drunk! It would be farcical if it weren’t so tragic.’

Another time, Ferrie noted: ‘She is divorcing Tommy. Can’t stand it any more. He keeps beating her up. Last time was on their anniversary.’

ITV was unavailable for comment on the statements from Ms Cooper.
