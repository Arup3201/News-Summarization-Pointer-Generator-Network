QPR players had to be separated from their own fans amid angry scenes as Harry Redknapp’s side set the worst away record in the top-flight in 50 years.

Richard Dunne is understood to have clashed with a supporter as he walked off at the end of a 2-1 defeat at Burnley and had to be led away by goalkeeper coach Kevin Hitchcock.

Coach Glenn Hoddle and Joey Barton then had to step in as Clint Hill also became involved in a heated exchange with a group of about a dozen fans which continued as the defender headed down the tunnel.

Redknapp tried to play down the incident afterwards, claiming that the incident had only involved veteran Republic of Ireland defender Dunne.

‘I think it was only Richard Dunne,’ said the QPR boss. ‘Someone said something to him. Kevin Hitchcock went over and took Dunney away.

‘Dunney’s a great lad but someone got the hump. He didn’t go to have a row with anyone. He started applauding and someone ... I don’t know what happened.’

Hill was reluctant to speak about the clash, adding: ‘I don’t want to get involved in all that. I don’t want to cause any more friction.’

The row capped a miserable day in Lancashire for Redknapp and his players as they suffered a 10th Premier League away defeat in a row – the worst in the top-tier of English football since the 1964-65 season – and took Burnley’s place in the relegation zone.

All the goals came before half-time, Scott Arfield and Danny Ings scoring for Burnley either side of a penalty that was won and converted by former Turf Moor favourite Charlie Austin.
