You might expect to see goofball Jim from American Pie strip naked and roll around the floor but it was the actor behind the character who let it all hang out at a TV station in Chicago.

In an apparent take off of last week's breakdown by Kony 2012 director Jason Russell on the streets of San Diego Biggs was caught naked on CCTV cameras in the corridor of WGN-TV Morning News.

The video shows an already topless Biggs pull down his trousers to his ankles and fall to his knees before wriggling around and ending up flat out face down on the floor.

There is no sound on the clip, but the actor appears to be shouting something.

When American Pie co-star Seann William Scott steps up to him his underwear comes down and the video shows Biggs making a blurred naked dash around the corner.

Dean Richards of WGN-TV said: 'Just before the interview went on the air, live, Biggs asked me if I minded if his people shot the interview for their website on their iPhones. We didn’t. It was a fun interview.

'After the interview, one of our security cameras caught Biggs just after he began to strip his clothes off.;

Earlier this week, American website TMZ released a close-range video of Mr Russell pacing back and forth along a busy San Diego sidewalk, shouting: 'You're the devil.'

Police said witnesses had called them to report that 'the underwear-clad male was in the street, interfering with traffic, screaming, yelling incoherently and pounding his fists on the sidewalk.'

Russell was calm and co-operative when apprehended, according to NBC San Diego, but seemed to be under the influence of alcohol. His wife Danica denied her husband has any substance abuse or drinking problems.

Although he was not charged with a crime, officials decided that Russell should be committed to hospital for medical treatment following the incident.

'During the evaluation we learned that we probably needed to take care of him,' a police spokesman said.

'So officers detained him and transferred him to a local medical facility for further evaluation.'

His family concluded: 'The focus remains only on his health, and protecting our family. We'll take care of Jason, you take care of the work. The message of the film remains the same: Stop at nothing.'
