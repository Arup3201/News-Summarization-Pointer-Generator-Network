His day job sees him playing action heroes who save the world from dark forces.

And X Men star Hugh Jackman is not the type of man to be scared off the streets.

The 44-year-old headed out in New York as usual on Saturday just a day after a bizarre incident in which a crazed fan threw a razor at him filled with her pubic hair.

The father-of-two wore black and white trainers with dark jeans as he strolled leisurely down the springtime streets of the Big Apple.

The veteran thespian sported aviator sunglasses as he carried what looked to be his lunch in a plastic reusable container along with a metal eating utensil.

The Wolverine star appeared relaxed and at ease in his knit beanie and grey jumper, despite Saturday's incident.

The Australian actor was training at Gotham Gym in the West Village when a woman reported to be homeless confronted him.

Kathleen
Thurston, 47, ran past the front desk in hysterics, crying and shouting
that she loved the X-Men star, according to reports.

Though the woman was eventually 
stopped by a gym employee, she reached into her waistband and grabbed an
electric razor full of her body hair, according to TMZ.

'The razor fell out of her hands when I stepped in between them,' Mike Castle, a trainer at the gym, told police.

Hugh asked the woman not to touch him, according to NYPD spokesman Sgt Tom Antonelli.

She was arrested a few blocks away from the facility and charged with stalking.

'Here's a woman who obviously needs help so I just hope she get the help she needs,' the actor toldÂ CBS New York correspondent Carol D'Auria.

Jackman was reportedly shaken by the incident, fearing that the woman was grabbing for a weapon when she reached into her pants.

The New York Post reported that the woman's address is listed as a Harlem shelter for the mentally ill.

The Les Miserables star has had more than just one run-in with this stalker.

Jackman has also seen the woman outside his seven-year-old daughter's elementary school in Manhattan and outside his home in the West Village, where he lives with his wife Deborra-Lee Furness.

'I suppose for me, the primary concern is my family, obviously,' the actor told CBS New York regarding his stalker.

Kathleen was taken to Manhattan Criminal Court, where she was awaiting arraignment on Saturday night.

It was not known if she had a lawyer.

Jackman's next role will have him donning the adamantium claws again in James Mangold's The Wolverine.

The actor is currently beefing up for yet another turn as Wolverine in Bryan Singer's X-Men: Days of Future Past.
