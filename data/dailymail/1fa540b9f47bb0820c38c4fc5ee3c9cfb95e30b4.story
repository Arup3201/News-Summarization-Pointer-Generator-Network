Castleford's plans for a new stadium moved a significant step closer on Thursday when local councillors gave the go-ahead for a major retail development.

Members of Wakefield Council's planning committee approved the outline application for a £135million project for a Five Towns Park on land just off the M62 motorway at junction 32.

The development includes a 10,000-capacity stadium for the Tigers as well as a new food store, shops and a country park.

The proposal will now go before Eric Pickles, the Secretary of State for Local Government, who has the power to order a public inquiry.

'It's a bit like getting over Becher's Brook,' said Castleford chief executive Steve Gill. 'It's a massive relief considering the amount of time and effort that has been put in to get to this stage.

'There's still a fair way to go but the vote was unanimous and I hope that will be taken into account when it goes before Eric Pickles.

'It's a major step towards getting a new stadium and providing nearly 2,000 jobs which will transform the area.'

Unless the application is referred, work could start on the project later this year.

Gill insists Castleford need to move into a new stadium to preserve their Super League status, arguing that the club's ageing current home on Wheldon Road is no longer sustainable.
