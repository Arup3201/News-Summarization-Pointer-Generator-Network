A mother-of-three has told how she's set to become a millionaire thanks to a beauty storage unit her seven-year-old son invented.

Marcy McKenna, 44, from California, was looking for a solution for the grooming products cluttering the bathroom and jokingly asked her son, Jack, to build something out of Lego.

Impressed with what he crafted, she turned the prototype into a working device and when the $132 'Style & Go' cabinet made its debut on the Home Shopping Network it sold out in three appearances.

Teamwork! Mother-of-three, Marcy McKenna, 44, has told how she's on her way to making millions thanks to a storage unit her seven-year-old son helped develop

Mrs McKenna revealed to the Huffington Post that her husband used to continually complain about the styling products and tools she would leave lying around.

'Almost every morning [he] would make some sort of comment about the hairdryer I had tucked into a towel bar or a styling iron I’d left out to cool on a counter top.

'There were electrical cords everywhere. And it wasn’t just our bathroom.

'My mother lives with us and because we have a pedestal sink in the bathroom she uses, she was storing her styling tools in a big white bucket. There was just nowhere to hide the mess.'

Set for success: Jack was the brains behind the Style & Go cabinet - he built the prototype with the help of his mother and grandmother using Lego bricks - the finished product sold out after three appearance on QVC

The budding entrepreneur was 
discussing her clutter issues with her mother, and noticed that her son 
was sat playing with his Lego.

She challenged him to solve her woes and create something.

'I remember thinking, If this turns into something,
 I’m always going to remember this moment,' Mrs McKenna recalled.

Matt worked with his mother and grandmother, to figure out what compartments were needed in the box and how the cords for electrical gadgets would be stored.

Once finished, the three were excited about what they'd come with. But getting the product to market was no easy feat.

Lacking the funds needed to bring the idea to life, Mrs McKenna entered TLC's contest, Homemade Millionaire.

Novel idea: The Style and Go is a wall mounted cabinet with a built-in power source that allows hair appliances to be used from the same place where they are stored

The reality show arms inventors with professional product guidance and exposure to suitable distributors.

After competing as one of only three 
finalists in the beauty product category, Mrs McKenna's Style & Go was 
declared winner.

The device made its debut on shopping networks including QVC and HSN in the summer of 2012.

Following its grand reveal, Lowe's also made inquiries about testing the Style & Go in 200 of their stores nationwide.

'I felt like it was meant to be,' Mrs McKenna recalled.

This year - hit by the entrepreneurial bug - she will be debuting more products that offer simple solutions to everyday problems on 
QVC. She projects revenue of nearly a million dollars.
