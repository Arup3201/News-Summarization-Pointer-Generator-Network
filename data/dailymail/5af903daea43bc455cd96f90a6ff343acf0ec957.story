A senior judge has condemned Parliament for scrapping sentencing powers which would have allowed him to extend a jail sentence for a dangerous convicted paedophile. 

Jason Leonard deliberately defied court orders banning him from accessing the internet - just weeks after being freed early from prison for child pornography offences.

Judge Andrew Woolman said he wanted to jail the 33-year-old for longer than the remainder of his 33-month sentence, but that changes passed in Parliament in 2003 did not allow him to imprison him for a further stretch. 

Instead Leonard was given just eight months for breaching a Sexual Offences Prevention Order which will now run concurrently with his current 32 month stretch imposed in 2013.

He may not be released until the end of his licence in February 2016.

The changes to consecutive sentencing were made in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which advises judges   to avoid consecutive sentences where possible.

At Burnley Crown Court, Lancashire, Judge Woolman told Leonard: 'This was a very, very deliberate breach of the SOPO and if I had the powers, I would undoubtedly have made this sentence consecutive to the current sentence.

'But Parliament for reasons best known to itself had abolished the right of judges to return a defendant to custody to serve the balance of a sentence and to impose a term to then be served. 

'That is a sad loss of power to the judiciary and one which does not serve the public at all. The sentence today, sadly, is completely academic.'

Judge Woolman added: 'There is no evidence at the moment that you have used your access to the internet to download indecent images of children, so I have no choice but to sentence you on what you say, that there isn't. You are clearly a dangerous sex offender. 

'There is no question about that. I don't suppose that anything the court is going to do is likely to change your attitude.'

Leonard was originally arrested in January 2012 after police had raided the he shared with his elderly mother in Haslingden and found a stash of 251 photographs of youngsters on his computer - five of which were of the most serious kind.

Inquiries revealed Leonard had also been distributing the pornography on a file sharing website - allowing fellow perverts worldwide to look at the vile pictures.

He originally intended to take his case to trial so he could air his 'distorted' views on sex to a jury. 

But in June 2013 he was jailed after admitting charges of distributing an indecent photograph of a child in January 2011, and allegations of making an indecent photograph of a child, between August 2011 and January last year.

He was ordered to sign the sex offenders' register indefinitely, was banned from working with children for life, and was given an indefinite sexual offences prevention order. 

Under the order, he was not allowed to use any device capable of accessing the internet, unless it has the capacity to retain, and display, the history and he makes it available for inspection by police on request.

He was also prohibited from deleting the history, from using any software that deletes it, and must not possess any device capable of storing digital images unless he makes it available for police inspection on request.

Leonard was freed in October this year after serving just 14 months of his sentence. But last month police went to check on his welfare as he had been 'outed as a sex offender by a leaflet and poster campaign in the area, and found a laptop at his home.

They then unearthed an external hard drive, fitted with encryption software, which he had hidden in a plastic bag and buried in a plant pot in the kitchen. 

The hard drive is being examined by police experts but it may take months or longer because of their workload.

Stephen Parker, prosecuting, said Leonard had told police the laptop had no intent access and he had been playing games on it.

He continued : 'It was apparent, on examination, it had been connected to the internet over the preceding days.'

The defendant was arrested and questioned and said he bought the hard drive and encryption software before he was sentenced.

Bernadette Baxter, defending Leonard, said he bought the hard drive to download mainstream movies and TV shows whilst he was awaiting sentence. 

She continued: 'He knows he should have disposed of it because of the sentence and he didn't do so. However, he is adamant that the device, when analysed, will not reveal any indecent images of children.'

Miss Baxter said Leonard was mindful of the shame he had brought on his 77-year-old mother. She added: 'He has learned a salutary lesson by being brought back to custody and being brought back before the courts.'
