Former Chelsea star Salomon Kalou is being sued for €10,000 (£7,100) after appearing to smash a lump out of the Berlin Wall with a hammer and chisel.

Kalou, who is now at Bundesliga club Hertha Berlin, was filmed chiseling the Wall by German terrestrial broadcaster ARD in a preview video for Hertha's game against Schalke on Saturday. 

The clip, which was filmed in the autumn, was shown in the Olympic Stadium before the game, and repeated on ARD's Saturday night highlights show Sportschau.

The Ivory Coast international could be hit with a £7,100 fine after smashing lump out of Wall 

The producers had come up with the idea of the hammer and chisel as a metaphor for Kalou's task of smashing his way into Schalke's rigid defence, with the Berlin Wall representing Schalke coach Roberto Di Matteo's unpopular defensive style.

The former Chelsea man obliged unquestioningly, and set about attacking a section of the East Side Gallery, an open air graffiti exhibition which is one of the longest remaining sections of the Wall. The Ivorian was apparently unaware that the Gallery, which attracts more than a million tourists a year, is protected under German monument protection law.

Not only that, but the gallery is beloved of many Berliners, with hundreds joining David Hasselhoff and Pink Floyd's Roger Waters to protest against its partial dismantlement last year. Kani Alavi, head of the artist's initiative in charge of East Side Gallery, was particularly incensed by Kalou's actions.

'When I initially saw the pictures, I nearly fell off the sofa,' Alavi said. 'Some celebrity is promoting himself at the cost of a monument, and public broadcasters are playing along. It shows a lack of respect. I'm very disappointed.'

The initiative has now made an official complaint to the police, and is looking to sue Kalou for around €10,000 (£7,100) worth of damage. The actual extent of the damage, and whether or not Kalou or the broadcaster will be held responsible, remains unclear.

'It's not the first time it's happened,' Alavi told BZ. 'We had a case a few years ago where someone was caught daubing the wall without permission, and they were ordered to pay €2,500 (£1,800) by the court.

Alavi was not the only one shocked by the clip. When it was broadcast on Sportschau, presenter Gerhard Delling was visibly taken aback, saying 'he's really taken a piece out of the Wall, there. The beautiful, old Berlin Wall!'. Delling's comment led to even more uproar, and the presenter was forced to defend himself against accusations of nostalgia for the oppressive Wall.
