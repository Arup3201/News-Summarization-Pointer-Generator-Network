Diving sensation Tom Daley is making waves after producing one of this year’s best-selling calendars.

Although his 2013 calendar was released barely a month ago, the bronze medal-winning star has already reached third place in a sales chart compiled by retailer HMV and official calendar maker Danilo Promotions.

Boy band One Direction top the list for a second year running, while Canadian teen star Justin Bieber is runner-up.

Daley, the high diving heartthrob who bolstered his army of fans through his appearances at London 2012, is the highest new entry in the list.

Comic character Keith Lemon - created by Leigh Francis - is at number four, after making his movie debut this year. He is four places higher than his glamorous love interest from the film, Kelly Brook, who makes her official calendar chart comeback.

Sir Cliff Richard, a regular best-seller, slipped from last year’s number two to six.

Sales of 2013 calendars are reported to be up 10 per cent, mainly on the strength of One Direction’s popularity, who are outselling the rest of the top 10 combined.

HMV merchandise buyer Craig Dodds said: 'One Direction topped the Calendar Chart for 2012, and it looks like they have no competition, athough HMV are experiencing a demand for Tom Daley’s raunchy debut calendar this week, so we may well see a festive surge from him too.'

London 2012 bronze medallist Daley, 18, appears in a 
variety of poses - some of them shirtless and covered in water.

But Tom has admitted that his calendar is 'almost a bit of a mick take.'

He said: 'The one on the front cover where I’m covered in water was really funny to do.

Someone
had to pound a bucket of water over me, it wasn’t cold, it was sort of 
lukewarm. It took a few takes to get to get it right through because the
water needed to be in the right place.'

He continued: 'I’m going to give it 
to all my friends at Christmas, it will be a funny present.

'My friends 
all think the calendar is really funny. It’s a mick take almost. It’s 
the first calendar I’ve done and it was good fun. I really enjoyed it 
and I just hope people like it.

'Apparently the Calendar Club said there is a lot of interest in it.'

Although the 18-year-old might look as 
if butter wouldn't melt in his mouth, some of the shots featured in the 
calendar reveal that he has a saucy side.

Among the photos are several shirtless shots, including one that sees him wrestling with a turquoise fine knit jumper.

Unsurprisingly though, Tom, of 
Plymouth, Devon, says his favourite picture falls on his birthday month 
of May, which shows him receiving his bronze medal at the London 2012 
Olympics.

In total, nine of 
the twelve photos show off his toned, tanned torso, although three are 
action shots.

The remaining images show off Daley's conservative sense 
of style, including a scrubbed up shot of the diver sporting a lilac 
cotton shirt.

Although Daley has never modelled in an 
advertising campaign, he's no stranger to editorial photo shoots and has
posed - in varying states of undress - for numerous British magazines 
and newspapers.
