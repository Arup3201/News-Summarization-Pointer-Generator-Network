A motorcycle clothing company is selling a blow-up vest it claims could help motorcyclists' safety on the road.

Fox News first reported on Spidi's Neck DPS Tex Vest, which retails for $599.90.

On the vest's product page, Spidi says that 'A double cushion will wrap around the user's neck area thus increasing the level of safety for such a sensible area in case of crash.

Technology: Spidi says its Neck DPS Tex Vest can inflate for riders in just 0.2 seconds 

'The system will work along the helmet to reduce potentially damaging neck movements all while also increasing the tendency to roll on the ground and thus limiting potentially dangerous leverage situations against the terrain’s surface.'

Spidi says the vest can be inflated in just 0.2 seconds and that the vest weighs 480 grams.

The company also says on the product page that 'The system is removable and rechargeable after use.'

Available in both black and yellow, the vest's airbags fill up after a CO2 canister is used, Fox News reported.

Motorcyles.org's Ty Van Hooydonk told Gary Gastelu on Fox Car Report 'It works off this simple tether that's attached to your bike, and it can attach to a lot of different bikes, and it's a very easy, simple system. Where you actually have an airbag that's built into your neck area.'

Van Hooydonk warned 'You know your spine up here actually has the smallest of the vertebrae and anything you can do to help give that some support, both from the helmet going down and also forward, sideways, all around, this neck brace will help you out when it's deployed.'

Spidi also sells other styles with the neck airbag system, including a full jacket, the Venture Neck DPS Airbag H2OUT Jacket, for $999.90, and a full jumpsuit, the T-2 Neck DPS Airbag Leather Wind Pro Suit, for $2,399.90.
