It is used to broadcast happiness, express sadness and vent frustration. So it perhaps no surprise that Twitter could help spot post-natal depression.

Microsoft scientists have identified changes in use of the site that suggest a woman is at risk of crippling mood changes after her baby is born.

The information could be used to treat women sooner or simply to ensure they have the help and practical support they need after the birth.

Twitter could help spot post-natal depression (stock image) and one day scientists think an app could be developed to help women get the help and advice they need

In future, it may be possible to create an app to provide early warning and dispense advice.

Around one in seven new mothers suffer from post-natal depression but the stigma surrounding the condition leaves many afraid to seek help.

Eric Horvitz, head of Microsoft Research’s biggest lab in Seattle Washington, hopes that by making diagnosis easier, more new mothers will get the attention they need.

However, there are likely to concerns about privacy, particularly when dealing with the sensitive area of public health.

Dr Horvitz began by scanning archives of Twitter messages for words and phrases related to the announcement of a birth.

When he was satisfied he had identified several hundred new mothers, he began to analyse their messages from the three months before and after having their baby.

An infant’s wails pull at the heartstrings in a way that other cries don’t, researchers found.

Just milliseconds after registering the cry, the brain’s emotion centres are hard at work. It had been thought that the brain was incapable of processing complex facets of sound in such a short time.

Other types of cry, including calls of animals in distress, fail to elicit the same response – suggesting the brain is programmed to respond specifically to a baby’s cry.

In 2012, a team of Oxford University scientists scanned the brains of 28 men and women as they listened to a variety of calls and cries.

After 100 milliseconds – roughly the time it takes to blink – two regions of the brain that respond to emotion lit up.

Their response to a baby’s cry was particularly strong, the Society for Neuroscience’s annual conference in New Orleans heard. The response was seen in both men and women – even if they had no children.

Researcher Dr Christine Parsons said: ‘There is a specialised processing in men and women which makes sense from an evolutionary perspective that both genders would be responding to these cues'.

He looked for changes in the amount of time the women spent on Twitter, the people they were in touch with and the language used.

For instance, an increase in the use of ‘I’ suggests someone is becoming more introspective and self-focused and has been linked to the onset of depression.

He then created software that analysed pre-birth tweets to predict with of over 70 per cent accuracy if a woman’s Twitter messages would show signs of depression after having her baby.

Adding in her tweets in the first fortnight after motherhood boosted the accuracy to 80 per cent.

A second study using Facebook posts confirmed that even although depression doesn’t hit until post-birth, changes in social network activity and postings pre-birth provide information about who is likely to be hit.

Dr Horvitz said ‘we can predict future behaviour and mood with well-characterised confidence’.He told the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s (AAAS) annual conference that someone could use his basic research to create and early-warning system that a pregnant women could install on her mobile phone.

He said: ‘Reading some of these tweets you can almost feel yourself in the hearts and minds of these people. You really feel for them as they struggle.

‘Imagine a new mums’ coach that was an app running on your own smartphone that might watch what you say to the world and your tweets. 

To spot post-natal depression, scientists looked for changes in the amount of time the women spent on Twitter, the people they were in touch with and the language used. They found that heavy use of 'I' shows a sense of isolation (illustrated)

‘It might say “I sense you might be grappling with this, here’s more reading about this, don’t worry it will last this long and here are resources for you,” versus people just being abandoned right now and crying on their own and being paralysed.’

He added that while there are likely to be ethical concerns, the app would be something that was run privately, on a woman’s own phone.

Stuart Dobson, of post-natal depression charity the PANDAS Foundation, said many women with post-natal depression find the thought of a medical appointment daunting and would welcome a test they could do in the comfort of their own home.

However, he questioned whether they would get the support they needed afterwards.Microsoft is also using the internet to benefit health in other ways.

For instance, by looking at questions typed into computer search engines, it is able to identify women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and see if they are getting all the health information they need.

Dr Horvitz has also shown that the number of people rushed to hospital with heart failure rises as more salty recipes are downloaded from the internet.
