The founder of a chain of academies who raised funds for the Archbishop of Canterbury has been investigated over ‘highly unusual’ payments.

Officials highlighted a series of dubious financial practices at 16 schools set up by Sir Ewan Harper in the Education Fellowship Trust. These included £90,000 paid to himself and £28,000 to his wife Jane.

Department for Education officials who investigated the group of 16 academies - the Education Fellowship Trust (EFT) - also criticised £45,000 expenses awarded in a year to just two governors, a £20,000 fact-finding trip to New York and excessive spending on hotels, meals and alcoholic drinks.

Further concerns were raised over family members being given unadvertised jobs - including a director of communications on £70,000-a-year - while £1,000 was spent on Christmas cards and £630 on customised umbrellas.

The EFT admitted that wine was purchased for a workshop with head teachers - as part of a training exercise designed to show that children, like grapes, can mature into ‘exceptional wines’ given the right nurturing or merely end up as ‘plonk’.

Sir Ewan’s links both to education and the Church of England stretch back decades. He was tutored at Cambridge by Robert Runcie, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury.

In the 1980s, he helped set up the Lambeth Fund, which raises funds to support past and present Archbishops of Canterbury.

Marlborough-educated Sir Ewan, 74, was knighted in 2003 for services to the Church of England, having been recommended by another former Archbishop, George Carey.

Before founding the EFT, he led the United Learning Trust - one of the biggest backers of academy and independent schools in the country.

A former businessman, he ran the family’s export firm, which he later sold.

Sir Ewan became chairman of the Lambeth Fund in 2011 but retired in March. The EFT said he had also now retired from the trust.

Officials from the DfE’s Education Funding Agency probed financial practices at the EFT after a review of 2012/13 accounts highlighted ‘highly unusual’ payments.

These included nearly £28,000 in rent and insurance premiums to Lady Jane Harper, who is listed as owning cottages which the trust uses as an office.

In a report, the agency said there was evidence ‘that the lease rental was a fair market price from an estate agent’ and that alternative premises were checked.

‘However there was no documented evidence provided to record the outcome of the inspections or the basis for the final decision to lease the current accommodation,’ it said.

Checks by the Daily Mail revealed the two grade II listed stone cottages with thatched roofs under Lady Jane Harper’s name were leased to the EFT after failed attempts to find a private residential tenant.

Official documents from East Northamptonshire Council show they were used by the United Learning Trust - the schools chain Sir Ewan previously headed - until it moved to larger premises.

Internal changes were made to make it suitable for residential use and it was put on the market through a letting agent in September 2011.

The council documents state: ‘As of 16th December no tenant had been found.

‘The applicant’s husband discovered the need to use the building as an office once again for his personal business.’

Another cottage in the same lane in the picture postcard village of Titchmarsh, near Kettering, is registered to Lady Jane Harper.

All the properties are next to the couple’s home, which is in both their names and was valued at £1 million in 2010. It is hidden at the end of a long gravel driveway and is set in extensive landscaped grounds with a swimming pool.

A woman who answered the door of the cottages said they were still being used by the EFT.

The Government probe also raised concerns about £90,000 awarded to Sir Ewan as chairman of the trust - as well as ‘transactions with companies in which the chairman has a controlling interest’.

The trust said £90,000 was paid to Sir Ewan because he was also chief executive at the time.

But the investigation found that Sir Ewan was forbidden from holding both roles under trust rules.

The trust, which has a turnover of £10million per year and lists 16 member schools on its website, was found to have committed ‘significant breaches of the Companies Act 2006, Charity Commission regulations and the Academies Financial Handbook’.

A report on the findings, which is redacted in places, makes 26 separate recommendations.

It highlights a series of questionable uses of public money including a £20,000 trip to New York by a group of heads. The report said it may not have been ‘the best use of public funds’.

Two governors ‘claimed £45,000 in expenses and other supplies and services’ while one academy in the group suffered a £38,000 fraud because IT security software was not up-to-date, enabling a transfer out of its bank account. The money is reportedly being reimbursed by the bank.

The report also highlights that expenses policy allowed for ‘moderate consumption of alcohol’ - even though alcohol spending is considered an ‘improper use of public funds’.

‘A number of claims were made that included the purchase of alcohol,’ the report said.

Meals and hotels were also claimed ‘in excess of the staff expenses policy’.

Concern was also raised over unadvertised posts for family members.

‘We found that a number of the appointed head office staff were family members of either trustees or senior members of staff,’ said the report.

There had been no ‘competition or advertising’ of the posts, which included a director of communication at a salary of £70,000 per year plus benefits.

Meanwhile a finance manager had been appointed on £100 an hour with no formal tender for the work. It was ‘questionable’ whether this was value for money, said the report.

More than half of secondary schools - and growing numbers of primaries - now have academy status which allows them to operate outside local council control.

But there have been a series of financial scandals involving some of the groups which run academies, leading to calls for tighter controls.

The agency issued the trust with a financial notice to improve.

A spokesman for the EFT said: ‘The EFA are very clear that all issues found are from pre-September - before significant structural changes were made and Johnson Kane was appointed as CEO.

‘The Fellowship had already commenced on change of policies and governance in November 2013, before the review took place.

‘The EFA acknowledged to The Fellowship that it was under a different structure and clear evidence was showing that there was a positive change in the operation since September 2013.’

Sir Ewan wasn’t available to comment and his wife refused to comment when approached at their home. ‘I haven’t got time,’ she said.

Lambeth Palace said Sir Ewan retired as chairman of the Lambeth Fund on March 31 as part of a ‘planned transition’.

A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘The EFA has undertaken a financial review on The Education Fellowship and is working with them to agree an action plan to address the issues raised. We have issued the Trust with a Financial Notice to Improve and if they do not take the necessary steps, we will not hesitate to take further action.

‘Academies operate under a strict system of oversight and accountability - more robust than in council-run schools - which means any issues are identified and that we can take swift action to address them.’
