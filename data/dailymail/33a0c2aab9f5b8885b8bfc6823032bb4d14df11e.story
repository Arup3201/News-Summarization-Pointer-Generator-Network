A court ruling in Italy has put an end to a 39-year legal dispute between Oscar-winning film star Sophia Loren and Italian tax authorities.

The 79-year-old Loren, who lives in 
Switzerland, was quoted as saying she was happy with a ruling by the 
supreme court that said her 1974 tax return was indeed covered by a 1982
 tax amnesty.

'A saga that
 has lasted nearly 40 years is finally over,' Loren was quoted by the La
 Stampa daily as saying, adding: 'I always look to the future and I 
leave bad experiences like this one behind me.'

A court ruling in Italy has put an end to a 39-year legal dispute between Oscar-winning film star Sophia Loren and Italian tax authorities.  Loren was spotted in Venice, Italy on Monday

Her lawyer, Giovanni Desideri, said: 'The supreme court has wrapped up a Kafkaesque case.'

Loren's tax experts, applying one of Italy's not-infrequent tax amnesties, calculated that she owed tax on 60 percent of her income that year, but tax officials insisted she should have paid tax on 70 percent of her taxable income.

Now the court has decided that the Academy Award winner was right.

Loren, who was born Sofia
 Scicolone and started out in film in 1950, famously spent 17 days in 
prison in 1982 in a separate tax dispute -- an incident that drew crowds
 to the jail near Naples.

Her latest leading role: Sophia was filming La Voce Umana, which is being directed by her son Edoardo Ponti, in her native Naples over the summer

The
 actress shot to fame internationally when she acted alongside Cary 
Grant in Houseboat (1958) and she won an Oscar for her heart-rending 
masterpiece Two Women (1961) about a mother raped while protecting her 
daughter in war-torn Italy.

She received a lifetime achievement Oscar in 1991.

Meanwhile after more than six decades in the industry and 10 years after her last big screen leading role, Sophia is making her return to the spotlight in her youngest son's new feature film.

The screen icon will be starring in Edoardo Ponti's La Voce Umana (The Human Voice), which she was seen filming in her native Naples over the summer.

The film is based on a 1930 play by iconic French playwright Jean Cocteau, which comprises a single monologue by a woman on the phone to her lover, who is about to marry another woman.

The actress' last acting role was three years ago when she played the part of her own mother in autobiographical Italian television La mia casa e’ piena di specchi (My House if Full of Mirrors).

Her last starring big screen part was back in 2004 when she starred in Peperoni ripieni e pesci in faccia (Too Much Romance … It’s Time For Stuffed Peppers), directed by Lina Wertmueller.
