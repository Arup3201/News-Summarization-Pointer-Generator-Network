A former college teammate of Dallas Cowboys running back DeMarco Murray has revealed that he's filing for divorce - just a day after unleashing a string of furious tweets alleging that his wife slept with the NFL star.

Brennan Clay played alongside Murray, 26, for the University of Oklahoma Sooners in the 2010 season.

Before heading off to church on Sunday, Clay, 22, told the world his wife of just five months, Gina D'Agostini, had had 'an affair' with Murray.

Brennan Clay, 22, revealed on Monday that he's filing for divorce from wife Gina D'Agostini just a day after he unleashed a string of furious tweets alleging that she and DeMarco Murray had slept together

'So Demarco Murray was having an affair with my wife...I'm done...' Clay wrote on Sunday afternoon to his nearly 25,000 followers.

Clay did not specify how long he believes his wife and the NFL player were together, nor did he say whether the affair has ended.

However, he did offer a couple of reasons their alleged affair is so wrong.

'1 has a baby momma and she has 2 kids,' he wrote. Michigan native D'Agostini does not have children with Clay. Murray has a baby with former Passions actress Heidi Mueller.

Clay failed to mention what might make such an affair so painful for him, besides the obvious feeling of betrayal: he and D'Agostini have been married just four months.

Clay did not fail to convey how he feels about the alleged breach of trust, however.

'I'm disgusted...' Clay wrote, before heading off for some spiritual consolation.

'On that note headed to church,' he tweeted before his account went silent for a few hours.

He later tweeted: 'People givin me ish for puttin it out there ..if you could read these messages ..YOU would too ..I wanted the truth out there'.

Brennan Clay played for the Sooners for four seasons starting in 2010, Murray's last year on the team, the New York Post reports.

He went on to go to training camp with the Broncos but was let go in August.

His more successful former teammate Murray was selected in the third round of the 2011 draft by the Cowboys, where he remains.

Murray has yet to respond to the accusations. 

D'Agostini makes a living as a fitness instructor in Dallas, according to her Facebook page.

D'Agostini lists her job as a fitness instructor on her Facebook page. She has two children from a relationship she had before her marriage to Clay earlier this year
