All the best school science experiments carry at least a hint of danger.

But when 13-year-old Jamie Edwards informed his stunned headmaster of his plan to build a nuclear reactor in a classroom, the obvious question was: ‘Will it blow the school up?’

Fortunately, in a victory for the spirit of amateur scientific discovery over the health and safety culture, Jamie’s promise that it was perfectly safe was believed.

13-year-old Jamie Edwards has become the youngest in the world to build a nuclear fusion reactor

And yesterday he became the youngest 
person in the world to achieve nuclear fusion from scratch at his 
Lancashire secondary school, using high energy to smash two hydrogen 
atoms together to make helium.

‘It
 is quite an achievement. It’s magnificent really,’ Jamie said 
afterwards. ‘I can’t quite believe it – even though all my friends think
 I am mad.’

Jamie, who 
attends Penwortham Priory Academy near Preston, has been fascinated with
 radiation for years, on one occasion even buying a Geiger counter with 
his Christmas money.

His 
fusion ambition was sparked by reading about a 14-year-old US schoolboy,
 Taylor Wilson, who had become the youngest to produce a small fusion 
reactor in Nevada in 2008.

‘I looked at it, thought “That looks cool” 
and decided to have a go,’ Jamie added.

Jamie Edwards (pictured) built the reactor from scratch in a bid to be younger than American Taylor Wilson who completed a reactor aged 14 in 2008

Jamie's first step was to enlist help from nuclear laboratories and university 
departments, but ‘they didn’t seem to take me seriously’.

Nuclear fusion is one of the most promising options for generating large amounts of carbon-free energy in the future.

To get energy from fusion, gas from a combination of types of hydrogen – deuterium and tritium – is heated to very high temperatures (100 million °C).

One way to achieve these conditions is a method called ‘magnetic confinement' – controlling the hot gas with strong magnets.

Jamie Edwards was inspired by Taylor Wilson's technique which used something known as 'Inertial Electrostatic Confinement.'

This method uses electric fields to do the work on charged particles - either ions or electrons - allowing them to be heated to fusion conditions.

So
 that left the laboratories at his school, and the task of convincing 
headmaster Jim Hourigan. Fortunately the head agreed, coming up with the
 necessary £3,000 funding.

‘I
 was a bit stunned and I have to say a little nervous when Jamie 
suggested this but he reassured me he wouldn’t blow the school up,’ Mr 
Hourigan said yesterday.

After months of work, the reactor was finally completed just ahead of his 14th birthday this weekend.

And
 yesterday, in a ‘radiation controlled area’ in a classroom, before an 
audience of experts, he flicked a switch and stared intently at his 
Geiger counter until it registered that fusion had indeed taken place – 
or created ‘a star in a jar’, as Jamie refers to it.

Nuclear
 fusion, the reaction that powers the sun, is very different from 
nuclear fission, or the splitting of the atom, that occurs in nuclear 
power stations and is the stuff of atom bombs.

However, both release vast amounts of energy.

Jamie started building the reactor in October at the science laboratory at Priory Academy, Lancashire, and finally finished the task this morning

The landmark experiment took place at school in Penwortham, near Preston

Scientists
 around the world are replicating Jamie’s experiment, but on a much 
bigger scale, in the hope of using it on a large scale to fuel cheap, 
environmentally-friendly power stations.

Jamie
 said: ‘I heard the Geiger counter rapidly go up and I was “What is 
that?”,’ he said in the afterglow of success.

‘Then I looked over and 
the neutron counter was right up off the scale nearly, and I thought “We
 must have done it”.’

The 
experiment was assisted by electronics experts who tested the apparatus 
for safety, while Jamie, his friend George Barker and the teachers 
involved had all attended a risk assessment course at a nuclear fuel 
company.

For his next 
project, Jamie – who wants to be a nuclear engineer or work in 
theoretical physics – has his sights set on building a miniature hadron 
collider.

Trying to rise the funds wasn't easy. Jamie said: 'I went to various nuclear laboratories and universities and they didn't seem to take me seriously'

Jamie said: 'It is quite an achievement. It's magnificent really. I can't quite believe it'
