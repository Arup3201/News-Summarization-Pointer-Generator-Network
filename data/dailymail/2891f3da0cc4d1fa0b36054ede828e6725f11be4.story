Chelsea's Spanish contingent were sticking together as they jetted off to Turkey for Friday's charity tournament in aid of the Soma mining disaster.

Cesc Fabregas and Fernando Torres were among a full-strength Blues squad flying over for the mini-competition, which also includes Fenerbahce and Besiktas.

Chelsea's Samba Boys were also keeping eachother company on the flight, with Ramires, Oscar and Willian posing for a selfie, which the latter posted to his Instagram account.

The Blues will play two 45-minute matches against the Turkish sides after they have faced eachother in the tournament opener. 

A total of 301 people lost their lives after the explosion at a Soma mine in May, despite a four-day rescue effort that saw hundreds more workers saved. 

The proceeds of the tournament will go to those affected by the disaster. 

All aboard! Summer signing Diego Costa has his paperwork in hand as he gets on the plane
