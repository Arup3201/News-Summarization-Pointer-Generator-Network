Planes are involved in potential safety breaches in UK airspace every three days, new figures have revealed.

Since 2010, 438 commerical and private flights over Britain have been flagged up to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) because they have flown too close together.

The worrying statistics come after it was revealed that 361 RAF planes have been involved in near misses in the last 16 years. Ministry of Defence officials had pledged to install new safety equipment in 1998, but never did.

Since 2010, 438 commerical and private flights over Britain have prompted safety investigations because they have flown too close together

If there is a reduction in the space between aircraft during a flight, the incident is required to be reported to the CAA under the Mandatory Occurrence Reporting (MOR) scheme.

If a pilot or air traffic controller feel that safety may have been compromised at any time, the authorities are also  alerted.

These conflicts are referred to as Airprox and are investigated by a specialist team that analyses  data such as recorded radar and voice communications.

A serious breach in safety occurred last year when two jumbo jets with around 1,000 people on board were just 100ft from crashing over Scotland, because pilots confused their flight instructions.

The two Boeing 747s were 30 miles north of Glasgow and preparing to cross the Atlantic when an air traffic controller spotted they were moving closer together.

Last month an airliner that was coming in to land had a near miss in mid-air with a motorised parachutist at 2,000ft about the ground.

When air space is reduced between two aircraft over UK airspace, it is reported to the Civil Aviation Authority

The
 Airbus A319 missed the flying-machine by only 150ft, causing the pilot 
to see the parachute canopy flash by the cockpit of the plane.

In 1948, 39 passengers died when two planes crashed mid-air over Northwood near London.

A CAA spokesperson said: 'An Airprox is a situation in which, in the opinion of a pilot or a controller, the distance between aircraft as well as their relative positions and speed have been such that the safety of the aircraft involved may have been compromised.

'The majority of airproxes do not involve airliners and serious airprox incidents involving airliners are extremely rare.

'For example, there have only been two "category A" incidents - where there is a serious risk of collision – since 2005.

'Nevertheless, any incidents that do occur are thoroughly assessed by independent investigators and a panel of safety experts.

'Any lessons that can be learnt are acted on and shared across the aviation industry.'
