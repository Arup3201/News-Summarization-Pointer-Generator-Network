A referee in Ecuador confiscated a coach's mobile phone on Sunday in a bid to stop him communicating with the manager who had earlier been sent from the touchline.

The bizarre incident occurred during Universidad Catolica's Primera A clash against top-of-the-table Independiente de Valle at Estadio Olimpico Atahualpa.

Things were not going well for the home side and the Universidad manager was given his marching orders during the game.

But the officials' attention soon turned to the dugout, where one of the coaches was seen receiving messages from the dismissed manager.

The referee marched over to the dugout and ordered the member of the coaching staff to hand the device over to the fourth official, severing communication ties with the manager in the stands.

Universidad went on to lose the match 2-1 thanks to a brace by Independiente forward Junior Sornoza.
