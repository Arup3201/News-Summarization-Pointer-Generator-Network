George Osborne has distanced himself from Boris Johnson’s controversial comments that suggested some people had too low an IQ to ever get to the top.

The Chancellor said he ‘did not agree with everything’ the London mayor said and that everyone should be given the best chance in life.

Both Mr Osborne and Mr Johnson are seen as future Conservative leadership contenders once David Cameron throws in the towel.

Last week the Eton-educated mayor of London sparked outrage when he said tackling economic inequality was ‘futile’ because some people were simply not born bright enough to compete in the modern world.

The Chancellor said he agreed that equality of outcome was not achievable, but said he disagreed with the way Mr Johnson had presented his argument.

‘I wouldn’t have put it like that,’ he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. ‘I don’t agree with everything he said.

‘I think there is an increasing consensus across the political spectrum that you can’t achieve equality of outcome but you should be able to achieve equality of opportunity.

‘You should give everyone, wherever they come from, the best chance. Education is, I think, the best key to this.’

Delivering the annual Margaret Thatcher Lecture last week, Mr Johnson said globalisation was intensifying the trend towards inequality.

‘I am afraid that violent economic centrifuge is operating on human beings who are already very far from equal in terms of raw ability, if not spiritual worth,’ he said.

‘Whatever you may think of the value of IQ tests, it is surely relevant to a conversation about equality that as many as 16 per cent of our species have an IQ below 85, while about 2 per cent have an IQ above 130.

‘The harder you shake the pack, the easier it will be for some cornflakes to get to the top.’

He said the income gap between the richest and the poorest was getting wider than ever because of the ‘God-given talent’ of those in boardrooms.

‘I don’t believe that economic equality is possible,’ he added. ‘Indeed, some measure of inequality is essential for the spirit of envy and keeping up with the Joneses that  is, like greed, a valuable spur to  economic activity.’

The Mayor of London, along with Prime Minister David Cameron, was educated at Eton College, Berkshire
