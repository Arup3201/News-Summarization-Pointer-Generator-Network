'Luxury lifestyle': Gaynor Godwin, 36, stayed in some of the world's top hotels as she lived off dirty money, the Old Bailey was told

A woman used criminally gained money to spend £30,000 on luxury overseas holidays and to buy three properties, a court heard.

Gaynor Godwin, 36, stayed in some of the world's most lavish hotels with her boyfriend Grant Allen over a four-year period, the jury was told.

The couple visited Dubai and America more than 
eight times between 2006 and 2010 and one trip to Disneyland Florida in 2009 with Allen's two children cost £8,700 alone.

Another jaunt to Dubai in 2009 cost around £7,600, the Old Bailey heard.

The prosecution say that Godwin must have know that her boyfriend was involved in criminal behaviour.

The
couple bought three properties and lived in a £700,000 home in 
Haverings Farm Barns, Rayne, Essex, where £33,000 was spent on 
landscaping the garden, said prosecutor Charles Evans.

They also bought and sold other houses, including properties in Epping, east London, and Stortford, Essex, as a way of transferring funds, the court was told.

‘Grant Allen used other people in the laundering process. He is somehow involved in criminal behaviour,' said Mr Evans.

‘The money would have been criminal proceeds and she (Godwin) must have known.’

Large amounts of money were transferred between the couple’s bank accounts, the court heard.

‘Grant
Allen and Gaynor Godwin lived an enviable lifestyle and travelled to 
Dubai and America, sometimes travelling first class and staying in 
luxury hotels,’ Mr Evans added.

When
police raided their home on April 20, 2011, they found large quantities
of cash, including £1,000 in the extractor fan in the kitchen.

Allen was later convicted of money laundering, jurors were told.

Godwin, who had been living in the Costa Del Sol in Spain, was not arrested until April 30 this year.

She
now denies conspiracy to remove criminal property and an alternate 
charge of concealing, converting or disguising criminal property.

The trial continues.
