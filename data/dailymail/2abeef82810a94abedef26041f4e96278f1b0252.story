Sebastian Coates has teamed up with fellow Uruguayan Gus Poyet at Sunderland after completing a season-long loan move from Liverpool.

The 23-year-old – who featured against England at the World Cup – joined the Reds in 2011 but has managed only 12 league appearances, spending the second half of last season on loan at Nacional back in his homeland.

But Coates will be hoping for a fresh start under Poyet at the Stadium of Light after sealing his deadline-day switch from Anfield. 

New arrival: Sunderland have signed Uruguayan Sebastian Coates on a season-long loan from Liverpool

New challenge: Coates will link up with fellow Uruguayan Gus Poyet at the Stadium of Light

Eyes on the prize: Coates has rarely featured for Liverpool but has 15 international caps to his name

The centre-back – capped 15 times by Uruguay – underwent a medical on Monday and becomes the club’s eighth signing of the summer.

He could make his debut when Sunderland entertain Spurs a week on Saturday. 

As reported by Sportsmail last week, Sunderland defender Valentin Roberge has completed a season-long loan move to Ligue One side Stade De Reims.

The 27-year old arrived at the Stadium of Light last summer from Portuguese club Maritimo but made only 13 appearances for the Black Cats.

Sunderland were waiting to complete the loan signing of Sebastian Coates from Liverpool before confirming Roberge’s exit.
