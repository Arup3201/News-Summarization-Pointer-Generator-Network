Two medical marijuana patients in Michigan have won a legal battle to have their infant daughter returned to them.

Maria and Steve Green's 8-month-old daughter, Bree, was placed the custody of Child Protective Services in September after it was determined that the couple could potentially be exposing the baby to marijuana.

The Greens, however, are medical marijuana patients registered with the state, and are legally allowed to possess small amounts of the drug to treat various illnesses.

On Friday, an Ingham County judge signed off on a deal that would allow the baby to be returned to the Greens.

'I'm ecstatic,' Maria Green told reporters outside of the courtroom.

Steve Green added, 'Bree will be in her own bed tonight. We’re going to hug her and read to her and love her.'

The deal acknowledges that the couple are legal medical marijuana patients - a big deal in a state that has been polarized over the issue since medical marijuana was legalized in 2008. The deal also requires the couple to attend parenting classes.

Steve Green, 34, is a former auto mechanic who suffers from severe epileptic seizures. After trying dozens of other medications, he found that t he only thing drug that helped him manage his seizures is marijuana.

Maria Green, 31, is a former teacher who suffers from multiple sclerosis. Both she and her husband are state-approved medical marijuana users. 

The couple was charged earlier this year with manufacturing marijuana, which is a felony punishable by four years in prison, after authorities found marijuana plants growing in their home. Friday's ruling grants the couple permission to continue growing the plants. The charges against the couple have since been dropped.

'We said we’re going to let the parents medicate (with marijuana) but 
not around the children, just what they’ve been doing all along, and 
allow some type of regular testing of the baby, maybe a mouth swab,' to 
prove that Bree was not being exposed, the couple's attorney, Joshua Covert, told the Detroit Free Press.

Bree was taken from the Greens on September 13, when CPS caseworkers came to their home and stripped her from her mother's arms.

'I was there and I have to tell you - that was hard to watch,' Covert said.

The baby's removal sparked protest from medical marijuana advocates across the country. The 'Free Baby Bree' movement began as attention to the case began to mount.

Four attorneys volunteered to work on behalf of the Greens as leaders in the medical marijuana community began to realize that the case would make or break how agencies like CPS handles parents who are legally permitted to use marijuana.

'The idea that medical marijuana patients can’t be good parents is just drug war hysteria,' said 49-year-old Charmie Gholso, founder of Michigan Moms United, an activist group designed to 're-educate the public and legislators about how the failed drug war destroys families.'
