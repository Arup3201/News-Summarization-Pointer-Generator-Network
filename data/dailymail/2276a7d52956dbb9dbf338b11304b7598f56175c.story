Alarm bells will be ringing around the Football Association after it was revealed the number of homegrown players plying their trade in the Premier League continues to dwindle.

Just 13.9 per cent of top flight professionals to have taken part this season hailed from their current club, in a study by CIES Football Observatory.

The startling figures serve as a hammer blow to FA chairman Greg Dyke, who has used his position to champion the cause of promoting young players.

Gary Cahill doesn't register as homegrown in CIES' study as he wasn't at Chelsea between the ages of 15-21

CIES follow UEFA's terminology when measuring homegrown statistics, meaning players are only valid if they have trained with the club between the ages of 15 and 21. The likes of West Ham's Stewart Downing, Aston Villa's Tom Cleverley and Chelsea's Gary Cahill do not count. 

Dyke set up a commission to identify the reasons why fewer English players are being given chances in the country’s top division.

Only Italy's Serie A has a worse record of sides bringing through their own talent in the top five leagues in Europe.

England's shunning of homegrown talent is nothing new – they have long since been behind Spain and France in that regard – but the record low points to an intensifying problem.

The German Bundesliga remains ahead of the Premier League with 16.4 per cent of homegrown players, while Ligue 1 leads the way with 24.6 per cent.

Raffaele Poli, head of the CIES Football Observatory, told the Guardian: ‘The low percentage of club-trained players in England confirms that if clubs have the money to buy talent they tend to be reluctant to give a chance to youth academy players.

‘So the question is: why are clubs signing the best prospects, if they know they will not play?’
