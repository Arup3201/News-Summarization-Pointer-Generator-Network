Millie Mackintosh is known for looking after her body and often embarks on gruelling juice cleanses to slim down for big events.

And it seems that she has been passing on her healthy words of wisdom to fiance Professor Green.

The loved up-duo decided to go on a healthy eating regime recently, but it backfired and nearly ruined their holiday.

Professor Green and Millie Mackintosh (pictured) embarked on a detox when they went on holiday but Millie says it nearly ruined it because they had 'detox hangovers'

Speaking to Feelunique.com, Millie said: 'At Christmas Stephen and I were on 
holiday and neither of us were happy with our bodies so we decided to go
 on this healthy eating plan but we both got that detox "hangover", and 
it nearly ruined our holiday.

'So for the wedding I’m doing a proper, 
sensible good from the inside out plan, working with my friend Maddy.

Millie doesn't really look like she needs any kind of detox...

'For me it’s not about losing weight but shifting that bit of puff, those
 few inches of bloat.'

The glamorous Made In Chelsea star and her rapper beau have instead opted for a sugar-free detox course with expert nutritionist, Madeleine Shaw.

'She’s
 an amazing nutritionist and she’s put us on this great programme. It’s 
no sugar, as it’s so ageing for the skin and body, but you can have 
sweet treats like sugar-free brownies.

'I have 1 ½ cheat 
days a week when I have a roast, cooked breakfast and my favourite – 
clams and pasta, it’s my weakness,' she said.

Millie
 says her top tip for slimming down is eating protein for every meal and
 in the morning she mixes up frozen berries with chia seed, coconut 
water and a vitamin and protein powder.

When she is looking for a sweet hit, she blends milk, raspberries and raw cacao together.

The reality TV star also shared her beauty secrets and exactly how she gets her infamous dewy glow.

She said: 'People
 are always really interested in what make-up I use. Even men come up to
 me in the street and ask me what foundation I use because their 
girlfriend wants to know; it's kind of bizarre.

'I swear by tinted moisturiser, I drink lots and lots of water and sleep is boring but it does work.

'My signature look is natural glowy skin, a
 defined eye with some lashes, natural wavy hair, and I love a smokey 
eye for the evening.

'I always leave the house with mascara on, I feel naked without it and my desert island product would be a hydrating face mask, I use them a lot when I travel and fly and if I'm hungover.'

She cites her top products as YSL Volume Effect Mascara, Millie Mackintosh Lashes, L’Oréal eye liner, Benefit You Rebel SPF15 tinted moisturiser, balm cleansers from Eve Lom, Emma Hardie or Darphin as well as face massages and Aromatherapy Associates face oil to beat any signs of ageing.

Millie also explains how she was bullied at school because she had bad acne.

She said: 'I
 used to pretend to be sick and once I didn’t go in to school for three 
days. It was hormonal, and over time I realised that I had to treat my 
skin gently, not so aggressively.

'Now I keep it clean and treat it carefully and it’s much better, much calmer but I still get the odd breakout.

'Using lavender oil to dab on keeps the bacteria away, and I steer away from anything heavy or too active.'

 1. She preps her skin with a hydrating face mask. 'It's all about the skincare, I use this amazing Decleor hydrating face mask,' she says.2. She then applies Guerlain primer. 'Apply with a foundation brush to get that glow lasting all day,' she advises.3. She then uses Shiseido tinted moisturiser and concealer for a light coverage and to even out her skin tone.4. She applies two concealers because she explains how the skin under our eyes is much thinner and we also want to illuminate it. She loves the Stila illuminator.5. She then uses a Benefit highlighter, Watt's Up. 'Apply along the top of your cheek bone and highlight the brow bone too,' she says.6. She completes the look by sweeping Guerlian bronzer over her skin and a Jurlique transcluent powder.
