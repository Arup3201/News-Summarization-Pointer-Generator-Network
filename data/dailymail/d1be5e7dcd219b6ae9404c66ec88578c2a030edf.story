Hatem Ben Arfa will have to wait until next season before making his Nice debut, Sportsmail understands.

FIFA have responded to the French Football Federation’s request for a ruling on whether Ben Arfa can play for Nice this season, having already turned out for Newcastle United and Hull City.

Rules state that a player can be registered with three clubs in one season but can only play for two of those.

Ben Arfa played for Newcastle Under 21s and Hull this season but cannot play for a third team 

However, the confusion arose because Ben Arfa’s appearance for Newcastle came in an Under-21 fixture.

But it now appears FIFA have decided that was an official match and refused the former France forward permission to play.

Ben Arfa signed for Nice earlier this month having been released from his contract by Newcastle. He spent the first half of the campaign on loan at Hull.

Earlier on Wednesday, Nice boss Claude Puel said he was hopeful the 27-year-old would be given clearance to play.

'For us, his eligibility is not in doubt,’ he said.

'The English federation wrote to the French federation and to FIFA explaining that the match played by Hatem (for Newcastle) did not count towards an official competition.

Ben Arfa made eight appearances for Hull before falling out of favour with manager Bruce

'The advantages are with us and with the player. There is no reason why he will not be eligible as normal.

'We are optimistic and positive that he can return to France, return to Ligue 1 and, I hope, explode with OGC Nice.'
