MariePaule Vermersch, the woman who, with her parents, first introduced the now famous Belgian waffle to the U.S. at New York's World's Fair in 1964, has detailed how the fluffy breakfast treat fast became a culinary sensation.

'From the moment we opened there was a 
line. We couldn't see the end,' recalls Ms Vermersch, 66, who 
helped her parents serve an average of 2,500 waffles a day during the 
fair, which opened on April 22, 1964. 'It was wild.'

The Belgian family, who served their waffles topped with fresh whipped cream, powdered sugar and sliced strawberries, touted their creation as a 'light, crispy and fluffy' alternative to the American variety.

The Vermersches first served the treat
 two years earlier at the 1962 World's Fair in Seattle, and for years 
after they made the waffles at the annual New York State Fair in 
Syracuse.

But it was at the 1964 event in New York City that the waffles became a sensation.

According to Ms Vermersch, they were supposed to be called Brussels 
waffles â€” named for the Belgian capital, where they were a specialty â€” 
but her mother Rose soon realized many Americans didn't know where Brussels 
was.

To this day, baby boomers 
fondly recall the memory of enjoying them at the fair.

Ms Vermersch said that for years she ran a
 coffee shop, MariePaule's Authentic Belgian Waffles, in her current 
home of Albuquerque, New Mexico, that featured a picture of the 1964 
World's Fair.

'People would 
look at the name and see the picture and say, "I ate those waffles at 
the World's Fair," and they'd pick up the phone and call their parents,'
 said Ms Vermersch, who is in New York to attend the fair's 50th 
anniversary celebration this month, and also to care for her 95-year-old
 mother, who lives in Queens.

'I couldn't believe how often that would 
happen.'

What made the waffles so good? Ms Vermersch cites a special cast-iron pan that heats up to 500 degrees.

'As
 soon as the batter touches the grill, it gets crispy on the outside and
 soft on the inside,' she says. 'You don't want to put anything syrupy 
on it or it will turn it into a sponge.'

They served the waffles with whipped cream, adding hand-sliced strawberries for color.

Waffles in the United States date back
 to the Pilgrims, who were familiar with them from time spent in the 
Netherlands, which has a similar waffle culture.

line. We couldn't see the end

And during the latter part of the 18th century, 'waffle parties' were all the rage.

Today, a version of the Belgian waffle can be found in diners and restaurants across the country.

Ms Vermersch
 said she vowed never to create an instant mix because the recipe 
requires fresh, carefully prepped ingredients: pure vanilla, fresh yeast
 or self-rising flour, melted but cooled sweet butter, and eggs at room 
temperature, with egg whites added at the end.

But
 that's as much information as she'll divulge. About 12 years ago, she 
sold the Maurice Authentic Belgian Waffle recipe to a Syracuse family on
 condition that it be served only at the New York State Fair.

The exact recipe, she says, is a secret.
