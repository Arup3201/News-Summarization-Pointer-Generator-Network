Mel Greig has launched legal action against Southern Cross Austereo alleging employer treated her unfairly

One of the Australian DJs behind the 'royal phone call' prank that led to the death of a nurse is suing her radio station for failing to provide 'a safe workplace'.

Mel Greig, 31, pretended to be the Queen 
when she and co-host Michael Christian phoned King Edward VII Hospital in London in December and 
was put through to the Duchess of Cambridge's room.

The prank, during which the pair learned 
details of the Duchess's morning sickness, caused uproar in Britain and led to the death of Jacintha Saldanha.

It was revealed today that Miss Greig is taking legal action against Southern Cross Austereo radio group as it was learned she has been far from happy with her treatment.

She has reportedly been told by the company not to send a condolence message to the nurse's family.

While her former co-host Mr Christian, 26, has returned to work - and has been awarded the company's 'top jock' award - Miss Greig remains at a secret address as she prepares to voluntarily fly to London to attend the inquest into the death of Ms Saldanha in September.

Friends said the death of the 46-year-old nurse was still weighing heavily on Miss Greig, who, according to the radio network, can 'return to work at a time that's right for her.'

The Advertiser newspaper of Adelaide reported that she has filed a claim with Australia's Fair Work Commission on the basis she has received unfair treatment.

Mr Steven Lewis, group leader for commercial litigation at the Slater and Gordon legal firm, confirmed the move.

He told The Advertiser: 'I can confirm that a general protections application has been filed with Fair Work Australia on behalf of Mel Greig against Southern Cross Austereo alleging the radio station failed to maintain a safe workplace.'

Nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who transferred the prank call from Greig and her co-host Michael Christian to the Duchess of Cambridge's room and was later found hanged

The paper said it was understood that in coming weeks Miss Greig and the radio network would attend a conciliation conference 'where they will confidentially attempt to resolve their differences.'

Scotland Yard has passed a file of evidence to Australian police over the prank call.

British prosecutors have already said that no legal action will be taken in this country over the call, but yesterday the Metropolitan Police sent the information to the Australian Federal Police and New South Wales police. 

A spokesman said: 'The MPS has requested that consideration is given as to whether any offences were committed under Australian legislation.'

If there is no satisfactory outcome, the dispute will go before the Federal Court.

A close family friend, speaking anonymously, said it was hoped Miss Greig would finally be able to end her ordeal.

There was no immediate comment from Southern Cross Austereo.

Miss Greig celebrated her 31st birthday at an Adelaide hotel last March and despite being surrounded by 40 family members and friends she was said to be still suffering badly from the fall-out from the hoax call.

'It's been really hard for her to move on,' a friend said of the once-bubbly presenter.

'She hasn't been able to tell the 
Saldanha family how sorry she is for their loss and I think that's made 
it really hard for her.'

Christian has continued to work since the furore and has won a 'top jock' award but Greig is still in hiding

It was Miss Saldanha who had received the early morning hoax call at the hospital and, believing that it was the Queen and Prince Charles on the line, put the two DJ pranksters through to a nurse on duty in the Duchess's private room.

As a result of the outrage following the call and the subsequent suspected suicide death of Miss Saldanha, Miss Greig lost her 'dream job', said a friend.

Since then, said her friends, the radio network had not offered her a decent job for her to return to.
