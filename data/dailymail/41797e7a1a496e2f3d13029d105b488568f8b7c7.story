The Jewish community is on alert after Molotov cocktails were thrown at a synagogue and ignited a fire inside the rabbi's residence - in what authorities are billing a hate crime and attempted murder.

The attack on Congregation Beth El in Rutherford, New Jersey, on Wednesday was the fourth bias incident within a month against a Jewish religious institution or centre in the area, police revealed.

Within the last three weeks, a fire was intentionally set at a synagogue in Paramus and anti-Semitic graffiti was discovered at synagogues in Hackensack and Maywood, authorities said.

There is no evidence yet linking the four incidents but they still could be connected - and northern New Jersey residents should be vigilant but not afraid, Bergen County Prosecutor John Molinelli said.

The intentional early-morning fire could have been the work of more than one person and happened at 4:30am when incendiary devices were thrown at various parts of the large Victorian-style home.

It houses Congregation Beth El on its ground floor and the rabbi's living area on the second level.

Mr Molinelli said the attack was being classified as an attempted murder, after one of the devices was thrown through a second floor window and into the bedroom of the congregation's rabbi.

‘The manner in which this heinous crime has been committed has brought our office to really raise consciousness on this,’ he added.

‘This is certainly a hate crime, this is certainly a bias crime, this is aggravated arson - but most importantly, we are now looking on this as an attempted homicide.’

Mr Molinelli said authorities do not yet believe that the rabbi was personally targeted. A wide coalition of law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, is participating in the investigation.

The rabbi, his wife, five children and the rabbi's parents were sleeping when the fire occurred.

But nobody was seriously hurt. Police said the device thrown through the rabbi's bedroom window did not explode, but ignited, and the rabbi suffered minor burns putting it out.

Rabbi Nosson Schuman of Congregation Beth El told CBS 880 Radio that he saw a flash of fire outside his bedroom window before his bedspread caught fire.

He got his wife and five children out of the building safely and structural damage seemed minimal.

Investigators could be seen examining the sides and roof of the large white Victorian structure that houses the synagogue.

It is set far back from the leafy, quiet street and has a large synagogue sign, a child's swing set and a trampoline in its front yard.

The neighbourhood is ethnically diverse, and is dotted with houses of worship of several different religions.

The prosecutor said northern New Jersey residents shouldn't be afraid, but should be vigilant, and that all religious institutions, not just those of the Jewish faith, should be on alert.

Law enforcement and representatives from 
more than 80 synagogues and Jewish day schools had planned to discuss 
the three previous incidents on Thursday.

Etzion Neuer of the Anti-Defamation League, which has offered a $2,500 award for the arrest and conviction of a suspect, said they were very concerned about all four bias incidents.

‘We view these as part of a deeply troubling continuum that we pray will end now,’ Mr Neuer said.

The synagogues in Maywood and Hackensack are about a mile apart. The other two are within about seven miles of each other in Bergen County, just across the Hudson River from New York City.

The fire at Congregation K'Hal Adath Jeshuran in Paramus was discovered last Tuesday when members smelled gas in the building and contacted authorities.

Fire and police officials determined an accelerant had been used in the rear of the building to start a fire. The fire had quickly burned itself out and no injuries were reported. No arrests were made.
