For many tattoos are highly personal decorations, often a remembrance of an event or a person or a rite of passage.

Tattoos are usually applied using an electric needle inserting indelible ink into the skin.

In Indonesia, however, there is a dying art of tattooing whereby they are applied with a traditional method known as ‘hand-tapping’.

In this technique the tattooist uses a short wooden stick fitted with a needle to insert the ink. The needle bounces in and out of the skin as the first stick is rapidly hit with another. This is done with help from another tattoo artist who holds and stretches the area to be tattooed.

There are some tattooists determined to prevent the art becoming extinct and one, Ranu Khodir, allowed these photographs to be taken of their work and their subjects to bring them to a wider audience. 

It is a technique that has vanished in most places but is still in use in Kalimantan and the Mentawai Islands but other tattooing traditions are found in Sulawesi, Maluku, Timor and East Nusa Tenggara.

It has Polynesian, Borneo Dayak and American roots. There are a variety of hand-tapping tools including those made by the Dayak Bahau and Dayak Modang peoples of east Kalimantan, sometimes using materials such as ulin, one of the hardest timbers in the world.

Traditional tattoos in Indonesia have particular shapes that relate to each tribe's heritage.

Those who have experienced hand-tapped tattoos say that it is painful and that the sound of the sticks banging together can also be disconcerting.

Painful: A man lays recovering having had a tribal design tattooed onto the side of his head where his hair has been shaved to accommodate the design

It takes two: Two tattooists are required to hand-tap a design - one to hold the skin taut and the other to 'tap' the ink into the skin

Those who have been tattooed in this way say that the procedure is rather painful and the noise of the tapping is also disconcerting
