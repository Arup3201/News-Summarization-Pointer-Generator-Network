Google published its list of 'top trending toys', based on search engine results, on its blog this week 

Google said cold weather staples, such as Hunter wellies and Canada goose jackets, were among the most popular clothing searches, up 46 per cent and 140 per cent, respectively, since October.

The search engine published its findings in its Google Commerce blog after tracking online trends to identify the top trending toys, devices and clothing searches on the shopping avenue of its website.

Game consoles and tablets continue to be the top gifts trending on Google Shopping, but wearable technology such as the 'fitbit' are also on the rise this month.

'Jogger pants' have also risen in popularity, with searches for the item up 39 per cent from October.

The rise in popularity of ouija boards is likely to have been sparked by the release of the film Ouija last month.

The low-budget horror film, inspired by the board which is said to contact the dead, tells the story of a group of young girls who reach out to the spiritual world in search of answers about their friend's mysterious death. 

It topped the movie charts in the United States and Canada, after collecting $20million in ticket sales alone in its first weekend.

Google released the data ahead of Black Friday, which will see dozens of major retailers slash prices on goods.

Research suggests that shoppers are already preparing for the annual online shopping day, which falls this Friday and became famous in the UK after being a success in America.

Google said 27 per cent of shoppers have already begun hunting for Black Friday deals, in preparation for what is widely expected to be the busiest online shopping day of the year.

In the study, the internet giant also found that nearly 50 per cent of all 25–34 year-olds use their phone to shop online while standing in the queue at a shop.

Google said wearable technology such as the 'Fitbit' fitness bracelet (left) had risen in popularity  since last month while tracksuit bottoms (right) were also on the rise, with an increase of 39 per cent month-on-month
