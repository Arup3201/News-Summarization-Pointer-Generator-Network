Tory health minister believes plain cigarette packets would have a positive impact on public health as people would be less attracted to the habit

A health minister has admitted for the first time that David Cameron is blocking the introduction of plain cigarette packaging – despite growing pressure from health campaigners who believe it would be the most effective way to stop teenagers from being attracted to the habit.

Tory MP Jane Ellison, who told the Commons earlier this year that there would be draft regulations in place ‘by the end of April’, has now admitted: ‘There comes a point, as a minister, where you get things ready, then you basically wait until you are allowed to talk about them.’

Asked whether this referred to No10, she laughed and said: ‘I couldn’t possibly comment.’

Recorded at a meeting of the Tory Reform Group earlier this month, her words have emerged days after 600 clinicians wrote an open letter urging the Government to publish the plans.

‘Smoking-related disease remains the main cause of preventable deaths in  the UK, killing more than 100,000 people a year. It is necessary and logical to end the marketing of cigarettes and tobacco products through packaging,’ they wrote in the letter to the British Medical Journal.

Although Ms Ellison believes removing the distinctive packaging of cigarettes ‘would be very likely to have a positive impact on public health’, many of her Tory colleagues argue the move would damage small businesses such as newsagents.

Labour also claims that Tory Election strategist, Lynton Crosby, who has represented tobacco firms in the past, is influencing the hold-up.

Last night Luciana Berger, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Public Health,  said: ‘We now know the standardised packaging hold-up comes from Downing Street.

'There can be no excuse for further delay. The Government must bring forward the regulations it promised months ago. This is what Parliament has voted  for, concerned health professionals want, and what people support.

‘Cameron must do the right thing, and not cave into vested interests and stand up for the wrong people.’

Ms Ellison was not available for comment.

A No10 spokesman said:  ‘It is not true that any attempt is being made to block this measure.’
