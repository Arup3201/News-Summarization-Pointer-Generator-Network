England’s hopes of a revival following Wednesday’s win in Hambantota lasted as long as it took Kumar Sangakkara to reassert his superiority here in Colombo.

For Sri Lanka, Sangakkara’s effortless 86 meant a six-wicket win and a nigh-on uncatchable 3-1 lead.

For England’s stand-in captain Eoin Morgan, whose side blew their chance with the bat after a highly promising 90 in 109 balls from James Taylor, it was a reminder of how thankless leadership can be.

And news that England had been fined for a slow over-rate — only four days after Alastair Cook had been suspended for the same offence — confirmed it.

Batting at No 3 as the order was rejigged in Cook’s absence, Taylor produced an innings full of chutzpah, while Morgan himself crashed 62 off 47 balls as others flailed around him. England must now win the last three games to avoid another one-day series defeat. Even the most optimistic might struggle with that one.

The truth was that, from 170 for three in the 35th over, a total of 265 was at least 20 below what they should have achieved.

Taylor, needing treatment for cramp — a consequence of Colombo’s cloying heat and the energy-sapping exuberance of his batting — finally went when he could only sky Ajantha Mendis into the covers.

In the next over, Ravi Bopara — having pleaded for a chance in the middle order — was bowled tamely by Tillekeratne Dilshan. That heralded some dim batting from the rest, and it was left to Morgan, with 18 off the last over, to ensure respectability.

‘We were aiming for 280-290 and the latter part of the innings wasn’t good enough,’ he said. ‘But James was outstanding. To come in after a long break and play as he did was brilliant.’

Morgan’s late flurry, which lifts his record as captain to 427 runs at an average of 71, briefly camouflaged another problem.

On a Premadasa pitch offering turn, Sri Lanka’s four slow bowlers had taken nine wickets. England, on the other hand, again omitted off-spinner James Tredwell, preferring to take another look at the out-of-sorts Ben Stokes.

Morgan said: ‘We did need another spinner but we wanted to give other guys a chance. Giving Ben a game here gives the selectors another chance to see what he’s about.’

In the event, Stokes sent down only two overs, taking his series figures to 8-0-85-0. Earlier, he had scored six before top-edging a sweep. If a cricketer can unpick himself for a World Cup, Stokes is doing precisely that.

Chris Woakes had removed Dilshan early, but the folly of omitting Tredwell in a game which England had to win was underlined by a sharp-turning off-break from Moeen Ali which had Kusal Perera edging to slip.

Instead, Mahela Jayawardene, back after missing the third game to mark his daughter’s birthday, helped his old mate Sangakkara put on 96 before Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews finished the job with two balls to spare.

The 12 wides England bowled took their tally for the series to 43. Sri Lanka have sent down only 22.

In the endless search for positives, Taylor provided a gimme. Playing only his third one-day international — and his first not against Ireland — he was nervous initially, before settling down with a six over midwicket off Thisara Perera.

Ajantha Mendis also disappeared over the ropes and Taylor began to resemble the buccaneer who slashed three hundreds for Nottinghamshire in last summer’s Royal London One-Day Cup.

Now England’s management face a dilemma when selecting the team for Wednesday’s fifth game in Kandy, when Cook, confirmed as captain for the World Cup, returns as opener.

That leaves Alex Hales vulnerable only two matches after his return. His golden duck here was horribly anti-climactic, and he later dropped Mathews off Chris Jordan as Sri Lanka’s chase neared its conclusion. 

The other option would be to rest Joe Root, whose last two innings have brought him 48 not out and 36.

Jordan's double scalp of Jayawardene and Sangakkara proved to be too little, too late for England

Either way, Cook remains the cog around which others must fit. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live’s Sportsweek programme, England’s former batting coach Graham Gooch summed up the situation. ‘The best thing is to somehow get Cook back in form to make him worthwhile of his place in the team,’ he said. ‘He can only open and if he scores runs then all this talk will go away. I can’t see him not playing and still being in the squad.’

For the time being, though, England will be nursing their disappointment that another one-day series is on the verge of passing them by.
