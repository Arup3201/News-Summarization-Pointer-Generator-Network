Vladimir Putin did not sack his defence minister because of a multi-million-pound corruption scandal but because he was cheating on his wife - the daughter of one of the Russian president's closest allies, it has been claimed.

Mr Putin announced on TV yesterday that he had fired Anatoly Serdyukov, 50, saying he had become a
liability due to a probe into the sale of ministry assets at 
suspiciously low prices.

But rumours are fast spreading through Russian media that the real reason the former furniture salesman lost his job was because of an extra-marital 
affair that infuriated his powerful father-in-law and patron, 
Viktor Zubkov, former Russian prime minister, now chairman of oil monopoly Gazprom.

When police raided the apartment of Serdyukov's neighbour, 33-year-old female military bureaucrat Yevgeniya Vasilieva, they found valuable paintings, rare antiques and more than 100 expensive rings.

A Russian tabloid newspaper with connections to security personnel reported that Serdyukov was in the apartment as well when the raid began. Vasilieva was reported on Tuesday to have left the country.

Alexei Navalny, an influential anti-corruption blogger and opposition politician, wrote a post in which he said Serdyukov had broken one of Putin's most cherished unspoken rules that 'you must honour your family'.

Mr Serdyukov's replacement in a job which had been long eyed by rivals, former emergencies minister Sergei Shoigu, 57, is untainted by corruption and popular among Russians.

Mr Shoigu has also proved immensely loyal and shown few signs of political ambitions in nearly two decades in senior posts.

Mr Putin's announcement made at a meeting with Mr Shoigu appeared designed to show he will crack down on high-level corruption in his new, six-year presidential term.

‘Taking into consideration the situation around the Defence Ministry, in order to create conditions for an objective investigation into all matters, I have decided to free Defence Minister Serdyukov of his post,’ Putin said, sitting across the table from Mr Shoigu at a state residence outside Moscow.

The defence minister wields immense power in Russia, channelling billions of pounds every year through the country's powerful defence industry, the second largest arms exporter in the world.

Mr Putin has promised to spend 23trillion roubles (£456billion) on the military by the end of the decade. He said that the new minister must continue ‘grandiose plans for the reform of the army’.

Russian investigators raided the offices of Defence Ministry firm Oboronservis last month and opened a probe into the company on suspicion that it had sold assets to commercial firms at a loss of 3billion roubles (£60million).

Anatoly Serdyukov (right), a one-time furniture salesman,  owed much of his career to the influence of his father-in-law Viktor Zubkov, a former prime minister and trusted associate of Mr Putin.

Mr Serdyukov's control over Russia's arms budget had earned him enemies among ambitious Kremlin figures, including Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin who oversees the country's defence industry, government sources say.

His military reforms, which reorganised troops, cut the number of officers by more than 100,000 and exposed high level corruption, also made him disliked in the ranks.

However, his alleged role in helping to dismantle the assets of jailed former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky while he still worked in the tax office had led many analysts to believe Mr Serdyukov was untouchable and would weather the scandal.

Sergei Shoigu (right), an army general, was emergencies minister from 1994 until this year, when he became governor of the Moscow region.

Although the Russian authorities were criticised in 2010 over forest fires that caused Moscow to suffer for weeks under smoke and toxic fumes, his loyalty to Mr Putin and a background untainted by corruption have done him well.

‘Shoigu is unknown in our country as a great strategist or as a powerful military officer, but that is not needed in the post of the minister of defence,’ said Alexei Arbatov, a military analyst at the Russian Academy of Sciences.

‘If the defence minister is largely an administrative post, then Shoigu has very great merits,' he added. 'As an administrator he is already regarded very highly and moreover, he is popular in Russia and in social opinion.'

When he was serving as emergencies minister he was the most highly regarded minister by Moscow-based pollster VTsIOM.
