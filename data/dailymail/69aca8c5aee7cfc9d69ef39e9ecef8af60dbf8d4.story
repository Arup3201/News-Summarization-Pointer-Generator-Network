A puppy was rescued  from a river sand bar by Memphis authorities on Sunday - and is now looking for a new home.

A caller tipped off police to the marooned pooch at about 11:30am that day, the Memphis Police Department said in a Sunday Facebook post.

The young dog was found by police in the Wolf River with the water around six inches high, police said.

The puppy struggled in the water as temperatures continued to plummet, police said.

The Memphis Police  Facebook post said that 'The river was rising and the temperature was dropping. The puppy appeared to be getting weak and was having trouble standing.'

Memphis Fire Department Rescue was contacted by police - and firemen donned wet suits for the puppy's retrieval, police said.

Photos show the puppy being led out of the river and back to safety on land with a leash. 

Later, Memphis Animal Services collected the formerly-stranded pooch. 

WMC, which earlier reported on the rescue, said the puppy 'is about six months old and is a female pit bull mix. Her pet ID number is 274064 and is available for rescue or adoption on January 3, 2015.'

The station reported that the Memphis Animal Shelter can be reached by calling 901-636-PAWS for adoption or offering tips on who the puppy belongs to.
