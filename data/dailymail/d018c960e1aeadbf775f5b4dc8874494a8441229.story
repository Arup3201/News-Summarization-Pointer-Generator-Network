The former cheerleader accused of having sex with one of her students has spoken out after more internet slurs have been made against her to say she is 'not the female Sandusky'.

Sarah Jones, former high school teacher and captain of the Cincinnati Ben-Gals cheerleading squad, is accused of sexually abusing a student and unlawful use of electronic means to induce a minor to engage in sexual activities.

Despite prosecutors putting a request to the court for a gag order to stop her talking about the case, Jones told ABC today: 'I read on a blog that I was the female 
[Jerry] Sandusky. To read those things and not be able to comment, not 
be able to stick up for myself is not fair.

Not fair: Sarah Jones spoke to ABC about being called the female Sandusky which she said is really hurtful and not true

She said of her mother Cheryl Jones: 'It's almost kind of a guilty feeling that she is even involved in this because what has happened to her is not fair. My goal is for her charges to be dismissed'

'People don't know the real me. There's blogs and postings out there that I have slept with numerous people. I married my high school sweetheart.

'I just asked the general public to maybe hold their judgment a little bit longer until the truth comes out.'

Jones went on her lawyer's radio show earlier this month to speak about the charges against her.

She also appeared on the Today show and spoke of how she was dying inside.

Prosecutors asked the judge for a gag order on Monday to stop her from speaking out so much about the case so the 'truth could come out in court'.

Leland Hulbert, spokesman for the Jefferson County Commonwealth's Attorney's Office, said: 'We won't be sending out motions, we won't be going on radio shows. You will be hearing our arguments about the evidence in court.'

The judge said she would make a decision in the coming days. 

Struggle: Sarah Jones, a former NFL cheerleader accused of having sex with one of her students, previously spoke to the Today show to reveal her daily struggle dealing with the accusations

Last November, the married 
27-year-old Dixie Heights High School teacher was arrested and charged 
with the offenses as was her mother, Cheryl Jones, who was accused of 
tampering with evidence in connection with her daughter's case.

Sarah
Jones resigned from her position. Both pleaded not guilty in April, 
when they were joined by dozens of supporters in court, including the 
alleged victim's family.

'The hardest thing has been having not only me go through it, but to have my mom go through it with me.

'It's
almost kind of a guilty feeling that she is even involved in this 
because what has happened to her is not fair. My goal is for her charges
to be dismissed.'

Jones is currently under house arrest.

Earlier this month she again dispelled the claims as mere rumors and admitted she was dying inside because of them.

'I'm taking it day by day,' she said of the charges. 'Sometimes I take it minute by minute.'

When asked how she was coping and if she
was 'dying inside,' she added: 'Yes, I am. I call my parents on a 
regular basis and I say, "What can I do just to get through just this 
minute?"'

Jones, a five-year veteran of the NFL's Ben-Gals cheerleading team, refused to discuss the details of the case, only saying the rumors were started by the alleged victim's bitter ex-girlfriend.

'Just because it’s a rumor, it can be very disruptive to a career,' she said.

She admitted there were 9,000 pages of photos, Facebook messages and texts between her and the student, but it 'does not mean that every single page has something that is going to prove this case'.

'Torture': Jones, pictured with her mother Cheryl, said she looks at every article written about her

Accused: Jones was head cheerleader and five-year veteran of the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals

'Rumours': She also taught high school English but quit last November for 'personal reasons'

Case: The prosecution said it has 9,000 pages of photos and messages between Jones and her 'victim'

Arrests: Jones, left, was charged with sexual abuse and her mother Cheryl, right, has been charged with covering for her daughter by asking a witness to 'destroy' a phone allegedly containing evidence

Jones also grabbed headlines in 2009 when photographs and postings uploaded on TheDirty.com branded her a 'slut' with 'two STDs'.

When she emailed the site to plead they take photographs down, more posts appeared claiming she had had sex with Bengals players.

Appearing on ABC at the time, she said: 'To stand in front of 30 15-year-olds and tell them you don't have two STDs and that you are not a slut is the hardest thing you will ever have to do.'

Ms Jones sued Nik Richie, TheDirty.com’s founder, for character defamation. She was awarded an $11million default judgement but the litigation is ongoing.

The mother and daughter are scheduled to stand trial in October.

Deters also filed a motion seeking to
dismiss the indictment against Jones’ mother, Cheryl Jones, who is 
charged with tampering with evidence in the case.
