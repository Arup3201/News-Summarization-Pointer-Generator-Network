The wife of a man who drowned two years ago after a swan attacked him is suing his employer and the condo complex where he cared for the birds.

Amy Hensley filed the lawsuit last week, claiming the attack caused or contributed to the drowning of her husband Anthony Hensley.

She also contends that the defendants 'knew or should have known that mute swans are strongly territorial with a dangerous propensity to attack'.

Anthony Hensley, a father of two young daughters, tragically died in April 2012 after he toppled out of a kayak and into Bay Colony Pond in Des Plaines, Illinois, when the swan attacked.

The big bird continued to lunge at him as he tried to swim to shore, before he was dragged under water by the weight of his boots and clothes.

He was pronounced dead at a hospital after dive crews scoured the 50-foot-deep pond to find him.

The Cook County Medical Examiner's office concluded he drowned and ruled his death an accident.

His father Raymond Hensley said at the time that his son was a good swimmer but didn't stand a chance against the aggressive bird.

'It's tragic for him to have to spend the last few moments like that,' he told CBS Chicago.

'He’s going to be remembered as one of the most wonderful fathers in the world. A very good father, a very good husband; there wasn’t a mean bone in his body.'

For about 
10 years, Anthony Hensley regularly tended to the swans at Bay Colony 
Drive condo complex. The swans were used to keep the geese away.

Police
 said he was checking on the mute swans near the condominiums when one 
of the swans moved towards him, causing him to roll off his kayak 
and into the water.

According to the suit, a 'mute swan is one of the heaviest flying birds, with males averaging about 24 to 26-pounds'.

The birds are also extremely aggressive and 'attack by smashing at their victims with bony spurs in the wings, accompanied by biting with their large bill,' the suit added, according to Chicago Tribune.

The suit against Bay Colony Drive condo complex, Hillcrest Property Management and 
Hensley's employer Knox Swan and Dog, LLC, claims premises liability and violations of Illinois' Animal Control Act. 

The act says that the 
owner of an animal that attacks a person in certain circumstances can be
 held liable for damages. The suit seeks an unspecified amount in damages. 

The defendants have not commented publicly on the case.
