Not content with raising energy costs, suppliers are now making it difficult and expensive for customers to speak to them.

Those phoning about bills and services are facing a long wait, according to a study, with some firms keeping them on hold for up to almost 47 minutes.

And these calls are also generating unnecessary telephone bills for customer.

Recent price rises have caused a surge in callers wanting to change their tariff or move to a rival energy firm. But firms have failed to ensure their call centres have sufficient staff to deal with them.

Research by Which? found that the average wait for a customer to speak to a real person has increased over the past six months.

On average 14 out of the 16 energy companies called left researchers on hold for longer than they did when the same test was carried out in April.

A spokesman said: ‘Our latest research found that the longest average waiting time went up from 17 minutes 5 seconds to over 25 minutes.’

Scottish Power had the worst single example of keeping a customer on hold, with a delay of 46 minutes and 49 seconds.

Its average delay before a call was answered by a human being was two seconds short of 19 minutes.

Npower, which has the highest standard tariff of the Big Six energy companies at just under £1,500 a year, had the longest average delay of 19 minutes and 14 seconds – two minutes and nine seconds longer than in April.

The longest average waiting time was with the small company First Utility, where it rose from six minutes and 13 seconds to 25 minutes and 10 seconds.

Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?, said: ‘With trust in the industry already at rock bottom and consumers being hit by the latest round of price hikes, it’s time the energy companies started putting their customers first.’
