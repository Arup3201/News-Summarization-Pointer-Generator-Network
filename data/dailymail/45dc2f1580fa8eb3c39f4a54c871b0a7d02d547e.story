Barbra Streisand, Robert De Niro and Meg Ryan: just three of the Hollywood A-listers who have stayed at Kathryn Ireland’s French farmhouse La Castellane, 31 miles north of Toulouse, in the south-western Tarn-et-Garonne department.

Kathryn, 51, is well known in Tinseltown as the interior designer to the stars. Her client list includes Steve Martin, Lindsay Lohan and, most recently, Drew Barrymore.

News of her idyllic Gallic retreat spread when her book Summers In France was published in 2011. It documents life at La Castellane, which is set in 50 acres of glorious unspoilt countryside and has its own swimming pool.

The interior designer for the stars has put her 10 bedroom French house on the market for £1.76million

Now, after two decades throwing open the doors of La Castellane to famous guests, Kathryn is selling up and planning to move to Scotland, where a property she has been eyeing up for years has at last come up for sale. Her French house is on the market for £1.76 million.

So how did a British designer, who attended Heathfield school in Ascot, Berkshire, where she became great friends with the late fashion icon Isabella Blow, find herself hosting Hollywood stars at her French holiday home?

After Heathfield, Kathryn worked with society playboy and nightclub host Dai Llewellyn in London, before moving to America, where she met and married film director Gary Weis.

They went on to create the concepts for the pop videos that promoted The Bangles’ hit Walk Like An Egyptian and Paul Simon’s You Can Call Me Al.

It was on a holiday in France with Gary in 1990 that Kathryn found and fell in love with La Castellane. She was pregnant with her first son, Oscar, and had just finished working on a video with George Harrison in London. ‘Gary and I were living in Los Angeles at the time, but I had a nesting urge and wanted to buy a house in France,’ she remembers.

‘I opted for France because Gary was used to living in California and hated rain, and we knew that the summers in France would be good.

‘So we were on our way to Provence, driving through the most beautiful, unspoiled countryside – which was not unlike the West Country – and I knew that this region was where I wanted to be. We bought the house from a family who had lived in it for decades.’

Built in 1870, the farmhouse has ten bedrooms. Its 4,500 sq ft interior includes The Pigeoniere, a low-lying outbuilding which includes a dovecote that Kathryn has transformed into cosy guest quarters. Boasting sweeping vistas of the Tarn Valley, the house sits on a knoll and has 360-degree views.

Kathryn spent 20 years renovating La Castellane, working with a local architect to create her perfect holiday home.

First she stripped away all the linoleum to reveal limestone floors underneath.

‘I was soon turning what had been a modest 19th Century French farmhouse into the functional equivalent of a small hotel that would accommodate all of our friends and family,’ Kathryn says.

The farmhouse is situated 31 miles north of Toulouse, in the south-western Tarn-et-Garonne department

After the plumbing, roofing and electrical work was completed, she installed the swimming pool, which has become a focal point for the stellar list of guests who have stayed at La Castellane over the years.

She recalls when Streisand and her actor husband James Brolin were her guests. ‘Barbra sent ahead a list of all the things she didn’t want in the kitchen. Chocolate was one of them. Both Barbra and James were utterly charming, and Barbra and I ended up eating a small chocolate cake between us, after all.’

She also vividly remembers De Niro’s visit. ‘He came for dinner, and my three sons were really enamoured with him. He gets on with kids so well, and he taught mine a balancing act they loved.’

When Meg Ryan was filming in Paris, she spent a few days at La Castellane for a rest between shooting scenes. And Conde Nast magazines president Nicholas Coleridge was so impressed that he raved of his stay: ‘If there is anywhere on Earth more fun or more chic, I have not found it.’
