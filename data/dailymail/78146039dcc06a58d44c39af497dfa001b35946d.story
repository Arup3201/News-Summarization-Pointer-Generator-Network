The adult film industry in Los Angeles was shut down on Thursday after another porn performer's HIV test came back positive.

The moratorium will last until 'all performers who the positive performer worked with or had sexual contact with test negative' according to guidelines set by the adult film industry trade group.

This is the third such moratorium imposed in the last year.

Another porn moratorium: An adult film performer has tested positive for HIV. It is the first such occurrence for the industry in 2014, though three performers tested positive for the virus in 2013

'We take the health of our performers very seriously and felt that it was better to err on the side of caution while we determine whether anyone else may have been exposed,' Diane Duke of the Freedom of Speech Coalition wrote in a release.

The moratorium calls for an immediate halt to all productions until further notice.

The last moratorium ended last September, at which point performers became required to test for HIV and other STIs every 14 days instead of every 28.

Prior to that, a performer who goes by the name Cameron Bay made national headlines when she tested positive for HIV followed by her adult film actor boyfriend.

The moratorium ended after one week.

Performers in Los Angeles county have been legally required to wear condoms since 2012. Shoots in the porn capital have plummeted since the enactment of the law

This is the industry's first reported case of HIV in 2014 after three in 2013.

The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which successfully fought to require condoms for porn actors in Los Angeles city and county, calls it 'tragic' repeat of last year's cases and says it underscores the need for statewide action.

The county requirement has reportedly caused the number of porn shoots in Los Angeles, an area where the industry once famously flourished, to plummet.

Only 20 filmmakers had applied for permits as of the start of August, according to Film LA, which issues them.

Last year 40 adult filmmakers took out permits, compared with 485 in 2012, the last year before the ordinance took effect.
