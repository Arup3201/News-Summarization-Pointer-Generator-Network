Global warming has opened up an Arctic route mariners have been craving for centuries, making the journey from Canada to Europe shorter.

A large sea freighter has become the first cargo vessel to successfully navigate the hazardous Arctic Northwest Passage carrying - somewhat ironically - coal.

If other ships decide to use the crossing through the Arctic Ocean, along the northern coast of North America connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, their route would be 1,000 nautical miles shorter than the best alternative.

The 75,000 deadweight-tonne Nordic Orion, built in 2011 and specially strengthened to cross icy waters, left the Canadian Pacific port of Vancouver in early September with a cargo of coking coal and is scheduled to arrive in the Finnish port of Pori on October 7, according to AIS shipping data.

'The Northwest Passage is more than 1,000 nautical miles shorter than the traditional shipping route through the Panama Canal and will save time, fuel and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but even more importantly increase the amount of cargo per transit 25 percent,' said Nordic Bulk Carriers, the Danish owner of the ship.

Harsh conditions in the Arctic sea route so far have limited shipping mostly to small cargo vessels and ice-breakers, which supply northern Canadian communities.

The 225 metre long Nordic Orion, a panamax-sized ship that is currently off the western coast of Greenland, has a strengthened bulk to cope with floating ice.

The
 vessel is to deliver the coal to Ruukki Metals, a Finnish steel 
producer, which is ironic seeing as many climate scientists have blamed 
the melting of Arctic ice as a consequence of warmer temperatures caused
 by greenhouse gases emitted by burning fossil fuels, particularly coal.

As the ice continues to melt, some 
experts have estimated that shipping via the Arctic could account for a 
quarter of the cargo traffic between Europe and Asia by 2030.

Last November, Russian gas export company Gazprom made the first ever delivery of liquefied natural gas through the Arctic north-east route, sailing from Norway east to Japan.

Many maritime analysts have said, however, that large volumes of commercial shipping via the Arctic are at least 10 years away.

While mariners might be excited by the prospect of faster journeys, some people are concerned what would happen in the event that one of the commercial ships ran into trouble in the remote and icy waters.

Michael Byers, an expert in global politics and international law at the University of British Columbia, said: 'There are the environmental risks. The coal being carried by the Nordic 
Orion would not cause much damage in the event of an accident. But the 
fuel oil on board the vessel certainly would.'

But some people are concerned about the potential environmental impact as an accident in the hazardous waters could see fuel oil polluting the sea

Writing in an article for The Globe and Mail, he warned that shallow waters and icebergs still pose a risk to ice-strengthened ships.

He said small, hard chunks of ice called 'growlers' that float low in the water are incredibly difficult to spot, while 'icing' - when ocean spray freezes onto the outside of a ship - can cause it to become top-heavy and capsize.

In the event of an emergency, he also warned that Canada's search and rescue capabilities are 'desperately poor'.

He said long-range helicopters could take a whole day to reach parts of the Arctic Northwest Passage, offering little help to stranded crews, who even wearing survival suits could freeze to death in just one hour in the harsh environment.

The news of the 'new' crossing comes in the same week that the United Nationsâ€™ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released it's latest high profile report.

The UN scientists today said they are '95 
per cent' certain that climate change is man made, but still could not 
explain why the world has barely got any hotter in the last 15 years.

The IPCC said 
that sea levels have risen by 19cm since 1901 and are expected to rise a
 further 26-82cm by the end of the century.

It
 added that concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere have increased to levels that are unprecedented in at least 
800,000 years.

As expected, 
the IPCC raised its projections of the rise in sea levels to 26-82cm by 
the end of the century. The previous report predicted a rise of 18-59cm.

Storms will become more intense and frequent, and the oceans will become more acidic, the report predicted.
