Nico Rosberg has revealed the secret weapon which he hopes will fire him to victory at the Malaysian Grand Prix.

This week's race in Sepang is renowned as one of the most physically demanding on the Formula One calendar due to the extreme heat and humidity.

And Rosberg, who finished behind Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton at the season opener in Australia, has a rather unconventional way of dealing with the warm temperatures in Asia. 

Nico Rosberg revealed he will wear a sanitary towel on his forehead at this weekend's race in Malaysia

‘I have an issue with my eye when I sweat a lot,’ Rosberg began. ‘I do have a sort of headband in my helmet, but it is my trick.

‘I put a women’s… what do you call them? The thing you put in your underwear.’ When asked if he meant tights, Rosberg said: ‘No, inside the underwear.’

Sky Sports reporter Craig Slater then asked: ‘A sanitary towel?’ The German replied: ‘Sanitary towel. Is that what it is called? Yes. I put that on my forehead in the helmet to soak up the sweat.’

The German's revelation that he uses a sanitary towel provoked much hilarity in the media pen on Thursday 

Since its inception on the F1 circus in 1999, the Malaysian Grand Prix is widely renowned as one of the toughest on the calendar.

It takes place at the Sepang International Circuit, just outside the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur.

With air temperatures in excess of 30 degrees Celsius and humidity levels over 70 per cent, the 90-minute race is a gruelling experience for the driver. They can  lose up to four litres through sweat.

Temperatures are forecast to be 36 degrees Celsius for Sunday’s race, the second of the championship.

But that still falls short of the 42 degrees Celsius recorded at the 2005 Bahrain Grand Prix, regarded as the hottest in recent memory and won by Fernando Alonso (pictured below).

Temperatures are expected to nudge 36 degrees Celsius for Sunday’s race with a humidity of 75 per cent. 

Rosberg added: ‘The race is one of the toughest on the calendar because of the intense heat and humidity, so you have to be very fit.

'It is vital to stay hydrated, too because during the race I can sweat up to four litres which is massive and probably double the amount of a regular race.

‘It will be very demanding. By the end of the grand prix, your concentration levels will not be as high as they were at the beginning.’

Rosberg appeared alongside Fernando Alonso in the drivers' press conference on Thursday.

The Spaniard returns to the McLaren cockpit after he was declared fit to race by FIA medics after missing the Australian Grand Prix.

Valtteri Bottas, also absent from the curtain raiser with a back injury, has also been given the green light to race for Williams on Sunday.
