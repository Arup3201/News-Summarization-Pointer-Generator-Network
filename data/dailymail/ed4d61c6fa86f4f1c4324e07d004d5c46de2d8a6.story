There was also trouble with the 'special relationship' during the Falklands when the US threatened to tell Argentina that UK troops were landing on South Georgia.

Newly declassified files reveal that Britain's historic allies wanted to tell Argentina that the task force was planning to retake South Georgia, the first of the islands to be invaded by Argentina, on April 21.

The operation on South Georgia was the first stage of the campaign to retake the Falklands and it would have been disastrous had Argentina been forewarned.

But US secretary of state Al Haig told the British ambassador to Washington, Sir Nicholas Henderson, that informing Britain's enemy was the only way it could stay neutral and negotiate a peace deal.

Henderson reported Haig as saying: 'If the Americans acted in this way they would be able to show even-handedness to the Argentines and this would enable them to continue their role as go-between.'

But Henderson told Haig he was going beyond the obligations of neutrality and that the information could be used by the Argentines to mount attacks on the British Task Force. Haig eventually promised to keep quiet.

The files also reveal that US President Ronald Reagan urged a 'negotiated settlement' right up to the last moments of the war as Britain battled to win the upper hand.

He issued a last minute appeal to Margaret Thatcher to hand the islands over to international peacekeepers as the British neared victory.

Mrs Thatcher responded: 'Britain had not lost precious lives in battle and sent an enormous Task Force to hand over The Queen's Islands.

'As Britain had had to go into the islands alone, with no outside help, she could not now let the invader gain from his aggression. The Prime Minister asked the President to put himself in her position.

'She had lost valuable British ships and invaluable British lives. She was sure that the President would act in the same way if Alaska had been similarly threatened.'

Files released under the 30-year rule show that as British troops neared victory, Reagan made a late-night phone call to Mrs Thatcher urging her not to completely humiliate the Argentines.

'The best chance for peace was before
 complete Argentine humiliation,' he told her. 'As the UK now had the 
upper hand militarily it should strike a deal now.'

But Thatcher refused and continued to demand Argentine withdrawal.

The
 files also include Thatcher's secret testimony to the Franks Inquiry 
into the conflict, in which she describes the moment she learned that 
Argentina was about to invade.

She said: 'I just say it was the worst, I think, moment of my life.'

Lord Robert Armstrong, Secretary of the Cabinet, told Radio 4 this morning: 'She regarded it as an intelligence failure. The resources we had were finite and most of the resources were involved in the Cold War.'

An emergency cabinet meeting was held to discuss Britain’s response to the invasion.

Lord Armstrong said: 'There was great concern about what could be done about it. Our forces in the area were very scant confined to a small troop of marines and the HMS Endurance.

'If there was going to be an invasion there was little we could do to stop it. People were sitting round wondering what on Earth one could do about it. Sir Henry Leach came in and listened to what people were saying - then he said he could have a task force on the water by Monday. That transformed the situation.’
