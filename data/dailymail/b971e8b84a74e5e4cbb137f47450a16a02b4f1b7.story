Lewis Hamilton goes into Sunday's Formula One title decider in Abu Dhabi promising not to crack in response to Nico Rosberg’s mind games.

The British driver will start second on the grid — a place behind his title rival and Mercedes colleague Rosberg — in a race where the points controversially count double.

Hamilton leads by 17 points, meaning he only has to finish runner-up to be assured of a second world title at the age of 29.

Hamilton has attempted to avoid Rosberg's mind games on a weekend where the Mercedes drivers fight to be crowned Formula One world champion at the final race of the season

1. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) 334 points

2. Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) 317 points

3. Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) 214 points

4. Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) 159 points

Rosberg, who took pole by nearly four-tenths of a second yesterday, taunted Hamilton, saying: ‘Lewis has everything to lose and I have everything to gain.

‘The pressure is on him and I will keep it on him as much as possible. And maybe he will make another mistake, as we saw today [Saturday] and in Brazil. These are the signs that give me hope.’

But Hamilton, who has cut a disconsolate figure at times in the build-up to the race, said after qualifying: ‘I don’t really pay much attention to him, no.

‘Actually, today if I made any mistakes, it was the same amount as him. Today he had to do an extra lap on the race tyre, which will probably have an effect, whereas my tyres are perfect for the race. I have made very, very few mistakes through the year, so I’m not worried.

Great Britain's Lewis Hamilton only needs to finish second to win his second world title 

‘Nico is trying everything possible in his head to find some way of dealing with things, I guess. I just keep to myself and do my talking on the track.’

Sunday's race will start with a back-to-front look after both Red Bull cars were relegated to start from the back of the grid for having illegally flexing front wings.

Red Bull didn’t take the decision lying down saying, in a statement: ‘We are disappointed that we have been singled out when it is clear that other teams are interpreting the rules in a similar fashion.’
