Prince William and Kate's arrival in Singapore has handed the Pacific isle an opportunity to showcase to the world its stunning transformation from struggling island nation to glittering urban metropolis.

Thirty years ago the country was flexing under the weight of urban overcrowding, poor living conditions, political corruption and a severe lack of infrastructure.

But over the last 20 years, sweeping urban regeneration schemes have seen the country blossom into an oasis of modernity with constantly-sprouting skyscrapers and mechanical forests of solar-powered 'supertrees'.

However, while many have hailed 
Singapore's makeover an economic miracle, critics say the sparkling 
lights and glass facades mask a reality of government control and social repression.

Modern symbol: The £350m man-made 'Supertrees' in Singapore's the Gardens by the Bay have come to symbolise Singapore's ascent as one of the world's economic powerhouses and home to trend-setting urban innovation and design

Today the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the Gardens By The Bay on the second day of their Diamond Jubilee tour of south east Asia and the South Pacific.

The park is a massive £350million development in the city's Marina Bay area, and home to Singapore's newest spectacle - an imposing canopy of artificial trees up to 50 meters high spread across 250 acres.

It, along with the dozens of lavish hotels, towering skyscrapers and rooftop infinity pools, has come to symbolise Singapore's ascent as one of the world's economic powerhouses and home to trend-setting urban innovation and design.

However, draconian laws in the Pacific Rim isle make male homosexuality punishable by two years behind bars, 
gatherings of over five people require an official permit - and outstaying your visa can result in at least three strokes of the cane.

In
1992, chewing gum was ruled illegal after authorities decided too much 
was being stuck on pavements and wedged under public seats on buses and 
trains.

Today, gum importation is banned unless a user can prove it has a medicinal value.

Pornography and littering both carry 
hefty fines while the unauthorised use of a wifi internet connection is
considered hacking and can land an offender behind bars.

Singapore's media environment is also highly 
regulated. Censorship is common, internet access is regulated and 
private ownership of satellite dishes is not allowed.

Withing the Gardens By The Bay park, the towering structures, stretching 50 
metres into the sky, have giant steel and concrete trunks and thousands 
of thick wire rods for branches.

Fitted with solar panels, hanging gardens and rainwater catches, the trees will be used to display plants from across the globe.

A vast green space is also to be created in the area under plans to make Singapore the 'botanical capital of the world'.

The park will house a cluster of green conservatories and 
will also become home to the Singapore Garden Festival.

Visitors can take in a panoramic view of the gardens via an aerial walkway, dubbed the OCBC Skyway.

The walkway, which links the artificial trees, is suspended 22 metres above the ground - about seven storeys high.

City leaders want to create a continuous ring of greenery, with three gardens wrapping around the Marina Bay area.

Perhaps the most controversial issue 
for human rights groups are antiquated defamation laws that are accused 
of heavily curtailing freedom of speech and expression.

Kate Allen, UK Director of Amnesty 
International, told MailOnline: 'Singapore has a modern image but is in 
the Dark Ages when it comes to dealing with critics and others who fall 
foul of the law. 

'The government uses restrictive laws
to silence its critics, bringing criminal defamation cases against them
and censoring the media.'

In 2010, British author Alan Shadrake was jailed, charged with 
contempt of court for his book, Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock, which criticized the 
Singapore judiciary’s use of the death penalty.

In his book Mr Shadrake accused the courts of bowing to diplomatic and economic pressure when deciding how to dispense justice.

He claimed the courts favoured the wealthy and abused the law to suppress political opponents.

He was jailed for six weeks before his immediate deportation.

The government says restrictions on speech and assembly are
necessary to preserve economic prosperity and racial and religious
harmony in this multi-ethnic city-state of five million people.

But according to Ms Allen, 'It has rejected calls to repeal laws 
allowing detention without trial and caning has been imposed for some 30
offences, including immigration violations.'

She added: 'Recently Amnesty International welcomed a move to end mandatory death sentencing for drug trafficking and homicide cases but called for mandatory death sentencing for all crimes to be abolished.'

The country's vast regeneration is said to have begun in earnest in 2001.

By 2005, gambling was legalised in a bid to spark a surge in tourism, 
paving way for the construction of two multi-billion dollar casino resorts.

Vast sums of money was pumped into government regeneration schemes and more skyscrapers and hotels were built.

Its reputation as a business-friendly market helped attract increased overseas investment and its old problems of urban overcrowding, poor living conditions and a severe lack of infrastructure began to fade.

Singapore now has the world's highest percentage of millionaires, with one 
out of every six households having at least one million US dollars in 
disposable wealth.

The country is also the world's 
fourth leading financial centre, the world's second-biggest casino 
gambling market, one of the world's top three oil refining centres, the 
world's largest oil-rig producer, and a major ship-repairer.
