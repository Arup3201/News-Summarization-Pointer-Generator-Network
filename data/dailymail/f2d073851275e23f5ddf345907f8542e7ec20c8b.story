The head of Scientology has met with local government officials in Clearwater, Florida after the controversial church has been in a public spat with the town leaders for years.

The trouble began when the Church of Scientology bought a one-acre plot of land across from the Clearwater Marine Aquarium that the city was planning on using as a parking lot.

The church refused to part with the land when the city offered to buy it off them earlier this year, and the spat grew from there.

The Tampa Bay Times reports that the city began looking at other options for the parking lot- including one directly across from The Flag Building, a seven-story property that is the closest equivalent of a cathedral that the Church of Scientology has.

City Manager Bill Horne stoked the fired even further, previously telling the paper that because of the city zoning code's lack of height restrictions, the city could theoretically build as 'high as we want' in that particular plot.

The back-and-forth prompted David Miscavige, the reclusive head of the controversial church, to meet with Horne in a rare face-to-face sit down.

'His interest was- in light of everything that has happenedâ€” how do we move forward? That was the tone of the meeting,' Mr Horne told the Tampa Bay Times about the discussion that took place Thursday.

Horne hadn't spoken to Miscavige directly over the past three years before the Scientology head called and suggested this week's meeting.

'The last time we met was a little rocky. This time, it was a positive meeting,' Mr Horne said.

The City manager added that Miscavige's biggest point of complaint was actually the newspaper itself and how the Church had been covered in the press, specifically in relation to the Clearwater property disputes.

No final decision was reached over the property across from the aquarium, but Horne said that it appears as if Miscavige is more open to discussions than he had been in the past.

'I think there's some opportunity, one of which is, maybe we can get the site we really want to build a garage,' Mr Horne said.
