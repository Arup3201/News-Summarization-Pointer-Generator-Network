Kimberley, who only gave birth at the beginning of September to her first child with partner Justin Scott, looked radiant as she chatted through each look with presenter Ruth Langsford.

Dressed in a elegant black and white long sleeved top and black trousers, Kimberley gives her low down on everything from biker jackets to the catwalks latest trends. 

Enthusing about one M&S dress Kimberley says: 'We've seen loads of designers mixing florals and stripes together which is brave. We've seen Henry Holland and Tony Moraz they've all done it

'So when i found this dress on the high street I thought this could have walked straight off the catwalk.'

Despite having only given birth in September, and having a six-month old at home, Kimberley looked radiant 

Kimberley took viewers through three key trends; pastels (two far left and end right), combined stripes and floral prints (centre) and the classic biker jacket (second right) 

Two of the looks Kimberley chose were pastel (left) and the bold combination of floral and stripes (right) 

She and Ruth also debate the difficulty of wearing pastel shades, and praise the Queen for her forward sense of style. 

'I've been talking about pastels a lot this week and that is simply because they are everywhere. You can't avoid them.

'We've seen Jennifer Lopez wearing them, Kate Middleton,Reese Witherspoon.

'Even Her Majesty the Queen is rocking top-to-toe pastel! And if it's good enough for her it's good enough for all of us!' she says.
