Fox has become the latest major film producer to offer its movies for download - nearly a month before they are available on DVD or Blu-Ray.

Alien: Prometheus will become the first release to be sold online at a lower price than hard copies at $15 (£9.30) instead of $20 (£12.50).

The scheme will be trialled in the US but could come to the UK to as Tesco is a supporter.

Prometheus is set to be the first film Fox offers weeks before its disc based release online. Some say the move could be the beginning of the end for physical discs

In America Alien: Prometheus will be downloadable from September 18, compared to October 11 for hard copies.

It will be made available from the UltraViolet, a digital service which has united the film industry to combat piracy.

Giants like Walmart, Microsoft, HP, and Netflix and Lovefilm along with electronic companies like Sony are in a 75-strong coalition are all hoping that quicker, high quality movies will tempt customers away from illegal downloads.

James Gianopulos, chief executive of Fox 
Filmed Entertainment, said that the company ‘felt it was a good time to 
take a more dramatic step’ than they had been doing in the past.

Prometheus is set to become the first film to be made available by Fox for download weeks before the DVD release.

The e-films will be called ‘Digital HD’ or DHD to try and persuade viewers that they are getting something new.

Other recently release Fox movies such as ‘Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,’ ‘The Watch’ and ‘Ice Age: Continental Drift,’ will also be available at the reduced price before discs.

UV has been touted as a possible solution to stopping piracy and has won the backing of Universal Pictures and Warner Bros.

Films bought from one online ‘store’ will work with content bought from another, along with any apps bought from companies which are on board.

There is no lock on the films either and you can stream or download the film whenever you want once you’ve paid for it.

Ridley Scott's Prometheus, starring Charlize Theron as Meredith Vickers, is set to be released at a digital download weeks before its DVD and Blu-Ray release.

One UV account can be used by up to six people as well, meaning families need only pay for one subscription.

If you buy a UV disc, then you can stream or download it as often as you like.

Apple however has refused to join the consortium and instead offers films and TV shows through its iTunes service, although the restrictions on where you can play them are more onerous.

Amazon and Google have also launched similar services as competition for broadband consumers heats up.
