It has been revealed the Japanese firm which makes the lithium ion batteries for the troubled Boeing 787 Dreamliner also has a contract to supply batteries to the International Space Station.

GS Yuasa Corp, which has its headquarters in Kyoto is the focus of an investigation by authorities in Japan and the U.S. into the cause of a fire on a Japan Airlines plane at Logan Airport in Boston earlier this month and an emergency landing by an All Nippon Airways jet last week.

These issues caused the FAA to issue a rare emergency airworthiness directive, which led to the worldwide grounding of all 50 active Dreamliners that Boeing has delivered so far.

However, the lithium batteries that GS Yuasa supplies for the International Space Station are not the same as the one it makes for the Dreamliner, NASA spokesperson Josh Byerly said to Bloomberg.

Byerly also said that NASA will not reconsider its contract with the Japanese firm until after the FAA investigation is complete.

This comes as the Japanese transport ministry said that it will conduct a second probe into GS Yuasa Corp and also add Meggitt Plc, a British supplier to their investigation into the faults which have grounded the fleet.

Officials spent the day at Yuasa's offices on Tuesday and said that a team is also being dispatched to the UK to speak to the maker of a valve actuator for the 787.

Because of the ongoing investigation, Boeing said last week that it will deliver no more of their multi-billion dollar Dreamliner aircraft until the lithium-ion batteries are deemed safe.

GS Yuasa Corp is fully cooperating with the authorities, Yuasa spokesman Tsutomu Nishijima said.

'Weâ€™re checking parts and the manufacturing process to ensure work was carried out appropriately,' said Takano.

A spokesman for GS Yuasa Corp, which makes batteries for the 787, said the company was fully cooperating with the investigation, and its engineers were working with the officials from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Japan's Civil Aviation Bureau (CAB) at the company's compound in Kyoto, where it makes airplane batteries.

CAB official Tatsuyuki Shimazu told reporters the investigating team had been briefed by GS Yuasa and had toured the plant, looking at battery design, production and quality.

The Japanese investigation at the plant will continue on Tuesday on a more detailed level, including tracking battery batch numbers and production dates, he said.

Authorities around the world last week grounded the new lightweight Dreamliner, and Boeing halted deliveries after a problem with a lithium-ion battery prompted an All Nippon Airways 787 into the emergency landing at Takamatsu airport during a domestic flight.

Culprit: The Boeing 787's lithium battery can self heat as a result of temperature and pressure changes, which may have caused this battery fire on a Dreamliner at Logan Airport, Boston on January 7

Earlier this month, a similar battery caught fire in a Japan Airlines' 787 parked at Boston Logan International Airport.

U.S. safety investigators on Sunday ruled out excess voltage as the cause of the Boston battery fire on January 7, and said they were expanding their probe to look at the battery's charger and the jet's auxiliary power unit.

The battery is one part of the 787's complex electrical system, built by French company Thales SA.

'Results have shown the battery was abnormal in both the Boston and Takamatsu (incidents). They were the most damaged,' Shigeru Takano, a senior safety official at the CAB, told reporters ahead of the on-site visit to GS Yuasa.

'We will look into if the work that took place, from design to manufacturing, was appropriate.'

Shares in GS Yuasa, valued at close to $1.5 billion, rose 1 percent on Monday, having dropped nearly 10 percent since the Boston fire.

Both Japan and the United States have opened investigations into the plane after a series of incidents have raised safety concerns

The burned insides of the ANA battery showed it received voltage in excess of its design limits. However, a battery that caught fire in a Japan Airlines Boeing 787 in Boston earlier this month was found not to have been overcharged.

U.S. government investigators said there could still be problems with wiring or other charging components.

In Washington, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said the 787, which has a list price of $207 million, would not fly until regulators were "1,000 percent sure" it was safe.

Japan is the biggest market so far for the 787, with ANA and JAL operating 24 of the 290-seat wide-bodied planes.

Touchdown: A Qatar Airways Dreamliner is seen coming in to land at the Farnborough International Airshow in July last year. The aircraft has been plagued with safety issues since entering commercial service in 2011

Boeing has orders for almost 850 of the planes, which have the most complex electrical systems of any planes on the market.

It remains unclear if the investigations will cause other airlines -- and military aircraft builder -- to rethink their plans to use lithium-ion batteries, which are lighter and more powerful than conventional batteries.

Airbus plans to use similar batteries on its rival to the 787, the A350, which is due to make its maiden test flight in the middle of this year.
