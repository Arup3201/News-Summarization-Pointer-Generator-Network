A Buddhist monk who provoked outrage when he was filmed carrying a designer Louis Vuitton bag while on board a private jet has been accused of being a fraud.

Luang Pu Nenkham Chattigo attracted global attention when a video clip of him was posted on YouTube, with his high-flying image somewhat at odds with the quiet life of reflection and meditative study synonymous with his religious title.

Now the 34-year-old has been accused of being married, and having relationships with seven other women in a probe by Thailand's Department of Special Investigations.

Under investigation: The video clip received complaints from Buddhists across the globe, prompting a probe into the monks' behaviour

According to the department, Pu Nenkham, who is abbot of the Khantitham Forest Monastery in north eastern Thailand, is allegedly married to a woman called Yupinpraethong Janthawa.

He has also been accused by a fellow monk of being a fake, and wearing the religious robes despite not being entitled to do so - a criminal offence in Thailand.

Luang Pu Buddha Isara, the abbot at another monastery, filed the complaint againts Pu Nenkham  to Bangkok's Criminal Court.

The allegations surrounding Pu Nenkham have shocked Thailand, which is home the largest number of Buddhists in the world.

He is now being investigated by the Department of Special Investigations, and the Office of National Buddhism, which monitors the 200,000 monks in Thailand, according to the Daily Telegraph Newspaper.

The investigation was launched following numerous complaints from Buddhists around the world after the two minute and 47 second long clip was posted on Youtube.

The video showed monks, one of them Pu Nenkham, sporting fashionable mirrored shades and using wireless headphones on board the private plane.

The clip also prompted the Office of National Buddhism's 
director-general Nopparat Benjawatananun to warn the monks not to repeat the lavish behaviour, and there are plans for the watchdog to begin monitoring monks across Thailand.

Pu Nenkham is also the focus of a money-laundering investigation, with a police colonel, Pong-in Intarakhao claiming that the abbot, along with others, had 41 bank accounts filled with cash from public donations to his monestry, with the accounts mostly in his name.

Colonel Pong-in Intarakhao has also claimed that the monk owns two houses, as well as an incredible 13 cars and motorbikes.

The abbot is currently believed to be in Europe, and has been ordered to return to his home country within the next 30 days by  Mr Benjawatananun.

Thailand has attempted to help 
Buddha's 2,600-year-old doctrine stand the test of time through a 
variety of means, including imposing a ban on the sale of alcohol on 
religious holidays.

The efforts, however, are sometimes tainted by the monks themselves.

Last
year, about 300 out of 61,416 Buddhist monks and novices in Thailand 
were reprimanded - in several cases removed from the monkhood - because 
of their misconduct, ranging from alcohol consumption, having sex with 
women, to extortion.

The office also received complaints about monks driving cars, and scams and false claims of black magic uses by monks.

Mr Nopparat has said the monks 
in the video were acting 'inappropriately, not composed and not adhering
to Buddha's teachings of simplicity and self-restraint'.

Monruedee
Bantoengsuk, an administrative officer at Khantitham Temple in Sisaket 
province, confirmed that the monks on the private plane lived at the 
temple but refused to give details about the trip.

The
images from the video contrasted with the abbot's message on the 
temple's homepage that read: 'The true core of those who preach Buddha's
teachings is to not to own any objects at all'.

Mr Nopparat said: 'When
Lord Buddha was alive, there wasn't anything like this. There were no 
cars, smart phones or cameras, so the rules were much simpler.

'While the 
monks need to keep themselves abreast of new knowledge, current events 
and technology, they are restrained to choose the appropriate tools.'

He said one way to prevent the monks from misbehaving is for followers not to spoil them with valuable objects or vices.

'In
many cases, it was the followers who gave the monks the luxury. Some 
bought them sports cars. This is by no means necessary.'
