Gordon Brown has promised that Labour will go even further in handing new powers to Scotland - including more generous benefits.

Hitting the General Election campaign trail the former Prime Minister pledged that the Scottish parliament will have the final say on welfare and not Westminster.

Mr Brown - who plans to stand down as an MP in May - said a Labour Government will go further on devolving power to the Edinburgh government than previously promised.

The party will end UK-wide benefit rates, making it possible for the Scottish government to promise top-up payments to people north of the border.

The extra money would have to be raised in Scotland, but the plan is certain to spark a fresh row about the promise of more money.

Mr Brown declared: 'We will maintain the security of the UK benefits system, with UK benefit rates, underpinned by the pooling and sharing of resources across the UK.

'But we will go further by ensuring that the final say on benefit levels remains in Scotland by giving the Scottish parliament a wider power to top up UK benefits.

'This will ensure that Scotland is protected from Tory welfare cuts - there could never be another bedroom tax in Scotland - and from benefit cuts caused by a fall in Scottish funding due to, for example, the collapse in the oil price.'

He argued Scotland should be able to make 'different choices' about the size of benefit payments.

'We will go further by ensuring that the Scottish parliament has the power to introduce new benefits, funded from Scotland, to meet different circumstances and different choices we make in Scotland.'

But the move was condemned by the Tories, who warned it would leader to higher taxes and higher spending.

Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives,said: 'Scotland's economy is on the road to recovery with welfare changes meaning thousands more Scots are in work.

'But Gordon Brown is yanking the Labour party back to the bad old days of high tax, high spending and high borrowing that crashed the economy in the first place.

'Most Scots understand that it's better to have a job and be bringing home a wage to your family than to be parked on welfare under the Labour state.' 

Mr Brown outlined more welfare powers for Scotland in a speech to Labour supporters in Edinburgh today

The former party leader was  instrumental in winning last year's independence referendum after making a series of speeches towards the end of the campaign

Mr Brown used his speech to set out a raft of new Labour pledges designed to prevent wipeout at the hands of the SNP.

He added: 'While the Tories cut welfare and the SNP cut colleges, we would bring employment and welfare policy together with a positive vision for tackling the low skills, numeracy and literacy problems that hold back adults trapped in long-term unemployment.

'The fourth area where we will go further is in housing benefit. We will fully devolve the housing benefit. A massive £1.8billion in housing benefit is spent in Scotland every year.

'This is a huge sum that should be used not to indefinitely subsidise the private rented sector but to invest in new housing in Scotland.

'The fifth and final area we will go further in is in devolving welfare to local communities.' The speech in Edinburgh today is part of a Labour fightback following polls that have indicated the SNP could win more than 50 seats in May.

However, SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie hit out yesterday: 'This is absolutely farcical from Labour.

'Having claimed authorship of the Vow, declared it delivered and called for everyone to move on from the debate, they are now admitting that what is on offer is woefully inadequate and scrambling around trying to make it sound more substantial.

'The sheer panic setting in at the heart of Scottish Labour is palpable.' Meanwhile, the party's election chief has warned the party will not jeopardise the nation's safety by abolishing Trident.

Mr Brown will hit the General Election campaign trail with Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy, who has been tasked with getting Ed Miliband into Number 10

Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander said he would not do a deal on defending the UK.

But former First Minister Alex Salmond said that scrapping Trident would have a lot of support across Britain.

Mr Salmond told the Murnaghan programme on Sky News that the SNP also wanted the cancellation of the Trident nuclear deterrent 'instead of another bout of austerity from Labour or Conservative'.

He added: 'Diverting that funding, £30billion over the next ten years, into health and education and something useful and productive, I think that will have a lot of support in England as well as in Scotland.'

Mr Salmond also said that Ed Miliband had managed the 'remarkable achievement' of becoming 'even more unpopular than David Cameron' in Scotland after the referendum.

He said a formal deal with Labour after the General Election was unlikely but 'possible'.
