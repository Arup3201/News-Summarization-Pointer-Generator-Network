Braving the cold as they queued overnight, an onlooker may have thought these shoppers were hoping to get their hands on the latest gadget. 

Instead, they lined the streets for something less glamorous - the chance to enter a new Aldi store. 

About 250 people waited outside the store in Birmingham, ahead of its opening at 8am.

With its low price strategy, Aldi has enjoyed a remarkable rise in recent years. 

It is one of the budget chains, along with shops such as Primark and Lidl, that has delivered the biggest change in shopping habits since the 1950s.

The new Aldi store is the 15th to open in Birmingham - the budget supermarket is on course to open 54 in 2014

At the opening yesterday morning, Aldi staff handed out golden envelopes to the first 100 customers through the doors, which included the star prize, a Dyson vacuum cleaner.

Robot Vacuum Cleaner WAS £129.99 NOW £79.99 (saving £50) 

Nine inch Portable DVD Player WAS £49.99 NOW £22.99 (saving £27) 

21.5 inch LED TV and DVD Combis WAS £119.99 NOW £89.99 (saving £30)

Bluetooth earphones WAS £22.99 NOW £9.99 (saving £13)

Maginon FS-500 Film Scanner WAS £29.99 NOW £9.99 (saving £20)

The store also had special discounts on items including a 32 HD TV and a seven inch tablet PC. 

Shoppers also queued up for the chance to purchase a cut-price 21 inch LED TV & DVD Combis, portable DVD players, an espresso coffee machine and a range of goody bags.

Elsewhere, the store were selling packs of carrots, parsnips, cauliflower, onions, leeks and baking potatoes for a reduced 59p each.

Store manager Christopher Walker said: 'The team and I have very much enjoyed welcoming customers to our new store.

'The turn-out was fantastic and it was great to see so many people walking away with great prizes.' 

The star prize - the Dyson vacuum cleaner - was won by Richard Scott, from Billesley, in Birmingham. 

An Aldi spokesman told MailOnline: 'We do this at the majority of new Aldi stores that open.

'It's a really nice way to introduce people in the area to Aldi and to get them round to the store.

'It helps create a bit of attention and a buzz on the first day.'  

Aldi posted a profit of £260.9million in 2013, up from £157.9million in 2012 and is closing the gap on the 'big four' supermarkets of Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrison - it has the biggest rise in sales in 2014

The enthusiasm from the crowds highlights the rapid success Aldi and other budget chains have enjoyed in Britain. 

The budget stores are proving an increasing threat to Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrison's as more shoppers discover the low-cost groceries and cut-price luxuries that they offer. 

Recently, it was revealed that half of British consumers had admitted to visiting a discount store last month. 

Aldi, which is nipping at the heels of Waitrose to become Britain’s sixth largest supermarket, posted a 65.2 per cent rise in profit last year. 

It posted a profit of £260.9million in 2013, up from £157.9million in 2012, as it stepped up its assault on the country's so called 'big four' supermarkets, Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons.

Examples of Aldi's efficiencies include shelf ready packaging, which allows products to be displayed in-store in the packaging used during delivery, and packing areas that reduce queuing at checkouts. 

Aldi also now commands a 25 per cent share of the premium dry aged steak market and it sells 700 bottles of wine every hour.

During 2013 Aldi opened 42 new stores. It said it is on course to open 54 in 2014, with 60-65 planned for next year, taking the total to over 600. Aldi sees scope for 1,000 by 2022.

The firm said it is investing more than £600million over the next two years to support its growth. 

It also received a boost last month when rivals' Tesco saw sales fall at their fastest rate for 20 years and their share value plummet  after claims executives had artificially boosted profits by £250million.

Tesco has suspended four executives and begun an internal investigation. 

Aldi's history began in a small grocer's shop in the mining town of Essen in Germany opened in 1914 by Anna Albrecht, 

By 1948, her sons Karl and Theo had taken it to four other locations in the country, and in 1954, the first self-service shop was opened. 

The brothers had a falling out in 1960 over whether or not to sell cigarettes in stores, and the brand was split into Aldi Nord and Aldi Sud. 

In 1971, Theo Albrecht was kidnapped for 17 days and held to a ransom of $3million. The Albrecht family has remained notoriously private since.

Karl Albrecht is now in his nineties and was listed Germany's richest man by Forbes last year.  

The brand's name is a combination of the family's and the word discount.  

After branches were opened in America, the first store in Britain welcomed shoppers in 1990. It now has more than 500 across the world.
