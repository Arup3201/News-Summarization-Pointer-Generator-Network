Controversy: Around 37,300 homeowners have lost £7,000 each over the last two years due to the stamp duty

Families selling their homes have lost around £260million over the last two years as a result of Britain’s stamp duty ‘dead zones’, a report revealed yesterday.

The research, from the property website Zoopla, blames the stamp duty thresholds for forcing homeowners to sell their properties for less than they are actually worth.

Stamp duty is charged at 1 per cent on properties between £125,000 and £250,000, 3 per cent up to £500,000 with rates continuing to rise to a maximum of 7 per cent on homes over £2million.

It estimates around 37,300 homeowners, whose property is worth a figure which is just above one of the thresholds, have lost an average of £7,000 each over the last two years.

As a result, homeowners trapped in the so-called ‘dead zone’ are under-pricing their properties to make them more attractive to buyers.

The biggest problem surrounds the £250,000 threshold.

If you sell your home for £250,000, the buyer pays a stamp duty bill of £2,500. If you sell it for £250,001, the buyer pays £7,500.

For example, there were 46,875 sales between £246,000 and £250,000 over the last two years, but only 15,981 for properties sold for between £251,000 and £265,000.

Overall, Zoopla estimates homeowners in England and Wales have lost a total of £260.5million over the last two years.

The report comes amid growing pressure for the Chancellor to do something to address the stamp duty problem in tomorrow’s Budget which experts warns distorts the country’s property market.

Last week, the Institute of Economic Affairs slammed stamp duty as ‘a bad tax’ which should be ‘abolished’ by the Chancellor, or ‘at the very least’ overhauled.

Both the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Council of Mortgage Lenders think the crude thresholds should be replaced a system similar to the income tax regime.

Lawrence Hall, from Zoopla, whose shareholders include dmg media, a division of the Daily Mail & General Trust, said: ‘The current stamp duty system distorts the market.

‘It prevents thousands of sellers from achieving the full value of their property when they come to sell.’

The estate agency Haart yesterday called for a system which would allow a homeowner to cut their stamp duty bill when they sell one home to buy another one.

Under its radical proposal, a family could deduct the value of the stamp duty paid by the buyer of their home from the tax bill they must pay on their next home.

The move would particularly help ‘second steppers’, such as families needing to buy a larger home for their growing family.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘We keep all taxes under review. However, there are no plans to reform the stamp duty system.’
