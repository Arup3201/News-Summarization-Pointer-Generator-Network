This has been close to the perfect Test for England. You cannot complain about anything they have done from the start until the end of the fourth day.

It was absolutely fitting that Jimmy Anderson should end up with a five-wicket haul on his 32nd birthday and England’s bowlers have been very clever in the way they have used the short ball in this game.

In the second Test at Lord’s, they bowled short with the occasional full delivery but here they bowled full with the occasional short one, and that’s the way it is supposed to be. The captaincy of Alastair Cook has been good and he seems to have learned from the mistakes he made against Sri Lanka when he had everyone back.

On Wednesday morning he had three slips to MS Dhoni and that showed to Anderson that he could get him out.

And the fact that they got the last two first innings wickets quickly meant that Cook did not have to go into bat with a scrambled brain, having been held up by tail-enders for three or four hours. He could run off and focus on his batting.

The decision to bat again rather than enforce the follow on was a 50-50 one for me, because I think England would still win had they sent India back in again because the ball was swinging around yesterday morning.

If everyone had been fit and firing and all four seamers were contributing, I would have sent them in again but because of the simple need to rest the big two - Anderson and Stuart Broad - because of the drop-off between them and the next two - Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes - it was absolutely the right decision from Cook.

Impressive: Moeen Ali (centre) has really improved his spin bowling and is starting to look impressive

Solid: Debutant wicketkeeper Jos Buttler has been magnificent behind the stumps for England

England batted at the right tempo in their second innings.

You do not tee off from ball one in a Test match. You have to play yourself in.

And the declaration was absolutely spot on too. I would have done it no sooner nor later.

Then England showed considerable energy in the field after four long, hot days.

For your opening bowler to be able to run in from square leg and pull off a run-out from a direct hit was outstanding, as was the sight of another fast bowler in Jordan taking such a sharp diving catch at slip.

There are some real pluses coming out of this game. Moeen Ali’s bowling is getting better and Jos Buttler’s wicketkeeping has been excellent.

Hopefully the mental baggage and scarring of the winter is easing and the senior players can go from strength to strength now with the junior ones working around them.

Slip: England pace bowler Chris Jordan made a terrific diving catch to dismiss Cheteshwar Pujara 

Joy: England are closing in on victory over India and it could help to remove the baggage of a torrid winter
