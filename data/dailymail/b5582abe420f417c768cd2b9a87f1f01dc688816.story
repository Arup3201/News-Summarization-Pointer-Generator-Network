Charged with murder: Tobacco tycoon Mohammed Nisham has been accused of killing a security guard because he was too slow opening the gates to his apartment complex in the Indian state of Kerala

An Indian millionaire has been charged with murder after allegedly ramming his Hummer into his security guard because he was being too slow to open his gates.

Mohammed Nisham is accused of chasing the guard with his SUV inside an apartment complex  last month, squeezing him against a wall before beating him with an iron rod.

He was reportedly angry over a delay in opening the gate after returning home late one night two weeks ago.

The 50-year-old guard, K Chandrabose, died yesterday after being in hospital on life-support in the southern Indian state of Kerala.

Doctors treating Chandrabose said 'his heart had not been functioning properly following the impact of the internal injuries,' according to the Press Trust of India news agency.

Nisham was in custody in a jail near the town of Thrissur where he lives, police official Biju Kumar said today.

He has had several police cases filed against him, including one for allowing his nine-year-old son to drive a Ferrari on a public road in 2013.

He was granted bail on some cases and was ordered to pay fines for others.

India's economic boom has created a class of super-rich, whose excesses are frequently in the news.

Nisham has a thriving tobacco and real estate business in Kerala. 

He reportedly also owns hotel and jewellery businesses in the Middle East.

When he was charged with allowing his son to drive the Ferrari F430, police records showed he owned 18 high-end cars worth an estimated $4m (£2.6m), including a Bentley and a Lamborghini.

He let his son take the wheel of the £127,000 supercar on his birthday - with nobody else in the vehicle except for his six-year-old brother.

The boy drove it for several hundred metres along a  road - all filmed by his proud family, who then uploaded the footage to YouTube.

Kerala Police registered a case against Nisham  for uploading a video of an illegal act, sending out a wrong message to the world and allowing a child to drive a vehicle.
