Accident: Graham Connell died during an expedition with a mountaineering club in the Scottish Highlands

A hillwalker who died during an expedition with a mountaineering club in the Scottish Highlands has been named by police.

Graham Connell, 31, from Castleford, West Yorkshire, was found dead in the Jacob's Ladder area of the Cairngorms yesterday, following a large-scale search for him and five other people who were reported overdue on Sunday afternoon.

The other members in the party were picked up by an RAF rescue helicopter after being located by Braemar Mountain Rescue Team on a hill near Carn Tarsuinn at around 12.10pm.

They were not hurt. Mr Connell's body was recovered shortly after.

The search, co-ordinated by Northern Constabulary and Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team, involved more than 100 people.

The walkers were part of a larger group of 35 people who were visiting the Highlands, police said.

The party of six, including Mr Connell, are thought to be members of the Leeds University Mountaineering Club.

The
search operation was also assisted by Dundonnell Mountain Rescue Teams 
and officers from the Police Service of Northern Ireland, who are 
thought to have been in the area on a training exercise.

Further help was given by mountain rescue team members from the Lake District and Ogwen Valley in Wales, as well as sniffer dogs. Meanwhile, the RAF sent mountain rescue personnel from RAF stations in Lossiemouth, Leuchars and Leeming.

Police inquiries into the incident are continuing and a report will be submitted to procurator fiscal.

It is believed the five surviving 
hikers were forced to leave him after the accident because they had no 
mobile phone reception to call for help.

They
had to walk some distance before they were able to make a 999 call and a
helicopter eventually picked them up yesterday lunchtime. None required
hospital treatment.

On the night they went missing, the region was hit with 70mph winds with a wind chill factor of -30c (-22F).

Large areas of the country were 
blanketed in snow yesterday, with as much as four inches recorded in the
worst-hit towns, such as High Wycombe, while an inch fell in London.

Around a dozen schools closed in the Midlands, one of the worst-hit regions. North England was also badly affected.

Even more snow is forecast for the South today, while the North will remain cold but dry.

The country will see lows of -4C 
(25F) and highs of just 4C (39F), significantly lower than the average 
high for mid-February of 8C (46F).

Rain is forecast for tomorrow and Thursday as temperatures increase slightly.

The Met Office issued yellow warnings
for much of the country because of the danger of ice, and the 
Environment Agency had more than 118 flood alerts in place, covering 
large parts of central and southern England.

Twenty-two more serious flood warnings were issued in parts of the South West and Midlands.
