A climber fell more than 4,000ft to his death while going up the iconic Half Dome summit in Yosemite National Park.

He is the 17th person this year whose death was caused in the California park, which is on track for one of its deadliest years in recent memory.

A group of rock climbers saw him tumble down the granite outcropping's sheer face on Monday evening and he was recovered the next day.

A rescue team of rangers was not dispatched until Tuesday morning because of nightfall, a park spokesman said.

A helicopter crew found the man's body in the morning during an aerial search, reported the San Francisco Chronicle.

Rangers reached him on a talus slope soon after and recovered some personal items they believe were his nearby as well as from the summit.

But officials are so far baffled as to who he is as no identification has been found - and they also don’t know whether he fell or jumped.

However a park spokesman said it ‘looks like it was accidental at this point’ and investigators think he was properly equipped.

‘Chances are he went up the cables and then went down the face, either accidentally or by suicide,’ he told the Sacramento Bee.

Deadly year: Yosemite National Park officials in California are so far baffled as to why so many people have died there in 2011 already compared to other years

An autopsy is expected to be performed on Wednesday by Mariposa County medical examiners.

As the park continues a deadly year, it 
is the 17th death in 2011 either to occur in Yosemite itself or due to 
injuries sustained there.

It’s the second death in a month on Half Dome after Hayley LaFlamme, 26, died last month after falling 600ft in difficult weather conditions.

The park has averaged around a dozen deaths each year over the last decade, park officials told the San Francisco Chronicle.

Half Dome now limits climbers to 400 each day, which is a significant cutback from the 1,200 a day who used to get onto the cables.

Park officials are so far baffled as to why so many people have died there this year. ‘There has been no definitive explanation,’ a spokesman said.
