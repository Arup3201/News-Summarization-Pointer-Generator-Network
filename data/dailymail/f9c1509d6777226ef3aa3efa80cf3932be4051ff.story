Struggling: One in five boys cannot write their own name (file picture)

Almost one in five boys are struggling to write their own name at the age of five, figures suggest.

Government statistics show a gender gap still remains, with girls outperforming boys in areas such as writing and counting before they start formal education.

Some 19 per cent of boys cannot write their own name, or short words like 'dog' or 'cat', compared with one in 10 girls.

And two fifths of boys cannot write a simple shopping list, or a letter to Santa, compared with a fifth of five-year-old girls.

While almost one in 10 boys cannot count up to 10, compared with six per cent of girls.

The worrying statistics, published by the Department for Education for 2011, show how many five-year-olds are achieving specific early learning 'goals', including social skills, literacy and numeracy and emotional development.

Children's Minister Sarah Teather said: 'It's encouraging to see a small improvement from last year. This is a testament to the hard work of early years professionals.

'However, it is not good enough that more than two out of five children start school without the solid foundation they need to succeed and that boys continue to lag behind girls.

'That's why we are improving the Early Years Foundation Stage and radically slimming down the curriculum so that it is more focused on getting children ready and able to take advantage of the opportunities they will get at school.

'From next September we are cutting down the number of early learning goals children need to reach at age five, with a stronger focus on the key skills that they will need to thrive as they grow up.'

The statistics reflect growing literacy problems emerging across the population in the UK.

Earlier this month it emerged that hundreds of police sergeants are having to waste time correcting the poor English of frontline colleagues in reports.

The officers work behind the scenes checking files for basic spelling and grammatical errors, as well as ensuring that all basic arithmetic is correct.

As many as 500 'evidential review officers' - mostly sergeants on up to £43,000 a year - are employed by the Metropolitan Police alone.

A major reading campaign was launched this year after it emerged that one in three children does not own a book and one million working adults cannot read.
