Concerns are being raised about youth sports providing predators easy access to children in an environment where abuse can go undetected.

It comes as the Amateur Athletic Union said this weekend it is probing allegations of child sex abuse against former president Bobby Dodd.

This follows child sexual abuse allegations against assistants to coaches at Penn State and Syracuse universities that have rocked college sport.

Young athletes often spend significant time with coaches or team volunteers on the playing field, travelling to tournaments or at camps.

Millions of children lace up shoes, don swimsuits and grab rackets - but rarely does any of this happen with close parental supervision.

‘You don't necessarily know a lot about these people except they know how to coach basketball,’ Northeastern University's Jarrod Chin said.

Mr Chin, the director of training and curriculum at the university's ‘Sport in Society’ programme, cited basketball as an example.

The Amateur Athletic Union is probing Bobby Dodd and contacted police in Memphis, Tennessee, who have begun investigating the matter.

Two players alleged to ESPN he engaged in touching and sex acts in hotels during tournaments and that he gave alcohol to underage players.

Dodd, who has not been charged with a crime, was not available for comment and an attorney for him has not yet been identified.

There has been a wide variety of past instances of alleged sexual abuse in youth sports, the National Council of Youth Sports said.

'You don't necessarily know a lot about these people except they know how to coach basketball. It's a larger social issue, and sport is one avenue where sexual predators find ways to assault young people'

These range from a figure skating coach accused of molesting students to youth baseball and basketball coaches accused of abusing boys.

In addition coaches of girls' track and volleyball teams have also been accused of interacting inappropriately with young women, the council said.

‘It's a larger social issue, and sport is one avenue where sexual predators find ways to assault young people,’ Mr Chin said.

The National Council of Youth Sports has been trying to find the best way to screen coaches for at least a decade.

Some sporting organisations have made background screening mandatory, the council’s executive director Sally Johnson said.

The National Council recommends guidelines for such screening as well as use of a third-party company to process comprehensive checks.

'I think children get a feeling if something's not right, and they need to be comfortable coming forward to report that'

Ms Johnson also wants to see better training and reference checks about past behaviour by coaches.

The AAU, one of the nation's largest youth sports groups, said it planned to review the safeguards it has in place to protect youngsters.

‘I think children get a feeling if something's not right, and they need to be comfortable coming forward to report that,’ Ms Johnson said.

Mr Chin added: ‘I think a lot of people are feeling like they can say something, tell their story, that they are not alone.'
