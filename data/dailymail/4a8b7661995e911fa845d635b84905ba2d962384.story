It will take about 11 trillion gallons of water (42 cubic kilometers) -- around 1.5 times the maximum volume of the largest U.S. reservoir -- to recover from California's continuing drought, according to a new analysis by Nasa.

The space agency used satellite data to create an estimate of the water needed to end a drought for the first time.

They say it will help planners, who recently found California's three year drought is the worst seen for over 1200 years.

The finding was presented by Nasa scientists at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco.

'Spaceborne and airborne measurements of Earth's changing shape, surface height and gravity field now allow us to measure and analyse key features of droughts better than ever before, including determining precisely when they begin and end and what their magnitude is at any moment in time,' Jay Famiglietti of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena said.

'That's an incredible advance and something that would be impossible using only ground-based observations.' 

A team of scientists used data from Nasa's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites to develop the first-ever calculation of this kind - the volume of water required to end an episode of drought.

Earlier this year, at the peak of California's current three-year drought, the team found that water storage in the state's Sacramento and San Joaquin river basins was 11 trillion gallons below normal seasonal levels. 

Data collected since the launch of GRACE in 2002 shows this deficit has increased steadily.

Since 2011, the Sacramento and San Joaquin river basins decreased in volume by four trillion gallons of water each year (15 cubic kilometers). 

That's more water than California's 38 million residents use each year for domestic and municipal purposes. 

About two-thirds of the loss is due to depletion of groundwater beneath California's Central Valley.

In related results, early 2014 data from NASA's Airborne Snow Observatory indicate that snowpack in California's Sierra Nevada range was only half of previous estimates.

The observatory is providing the first-ever high-resolution observations of snow water volume in the Tuolumne River, Merced, Kings and Lakes basins of the Sierra Nevada and Uncompahgre watershed in the Upper Colorado River Basin.

To develop these calculations, the observatory measures how much water is in the snowpack and how much sunlight the snow absorbs, which influences how fast the snow melts. 

These data enable accurate estimates of how much water will flow out of a basin when the snow melts, which helps guide decision about reservoir filling and water allocation.

Now in its third straight year of unprecedented drought, California is experiencing its driest year on record, dating back 119 years and possible the worst in the past 500 years.

'The 2014 snowpack was one of the three lowest on record and the worst since 1977, when California's population was half what it is now,' said Airborne Snow Observatory principal investigator Tom Painter of JPL.

 'Besides resulting in less snow water, the dramatic reduction in snow extent contributes to warming our climate by allowing the ground to absorb more sunlight. This reduces soil moisture, which makes it harder to get water from the snow into reservoirs once it does start snowing again.'

New drought maps show groundwater levels across the U.S. Southwest are in the lowest two to 10 percent since 1949. 

A combination of
record high temperatures and sparse rainfall during California's
three-year drought have produced the worst conditions in 1,200
years, according to a study accepted for publication by the
American Geophysical Union (AGU). 

'The current California drought is exceptionally severe in
the context of at least the last millennium and is driven by
reduced though not unprecedented precipitation and record high
temperatures,' the report's authors said in the study released
late Thursday.

The study by the University of Minnesota and the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution said that warm, dry conditions have
shrunk the supply of surface water from reservoirs, streams and
the Sierra Nevada snowpack in the state, even as demand from
people and farms has gone up, resulting in unprecedented
scarcity. 

Daniel Griffin, an assistant professor in the Department of Geography, Environment and Society at the University of Minnesota, and Kevin Anchukaitis, an assistant scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, asked the question, 'How unusual is the ongoing California drought?' and collected new tree-ring samples from blue oak trees in southern and central California.  

'We were genuinely surprised at the result,' says Griffin, a NOAA Climate & Global Change Fellow and former WHOI postdoctoral scholar. 

'One thing is clear, drought is going to continue to happen. This is the kind of thing we get to see in the future.'

The maps, developed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, combine GRACE data with other satellite observations.

'Integrating GRACE data with other satellite measurements provides a more holistic view of the impact of drought on water availability, including on groundwater resources, which are typically ignored in standard drought indices,' said Matt Rodell, chief of the Hydrological Sciences Laboratory at Goddard.

The scientists cautioned that while the recent California storms have been helpful in replenishing water resources, they aren't nearly enough to end the multi-year drought.

'It takes years to get into a drought of this severity, and it will likely take many more big storms, and years, to crawl out of it,' said Famiglietti.
