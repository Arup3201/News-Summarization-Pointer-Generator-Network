A teacher has been charged with sexual assaults involving four of his students from the 1960s.

Christopher Kloman, 73, was arrested on Friday at his home in McLean, Virginia after a yearlong investigation.

The head of a northern Virginia private school says they are 'deeply disturbed' by the news that their former, longtime teacher has been charged with sexual assaults.

Scandal: Christopher Kloman, 73, of Virginia has been arrested over alleged sexual abuse during his 29-year career at the esteemed Potomac School

Privilege: Staff, parents and pupils have been rocked by the sex scandal that has emerged and involves a former teacher at Potomac

Police opened the case after receiving a report from a 55-year-old woman who was a student of Kloman's at the Potomac School.

She came forward after running into Kloman at the Washington Episcopal School, where he was teaching at the time.

Police said their investigation found three other alleged victims, all girls ages 12 and 14 when the alleged incidents occurred between 1968 and 1969.

The Potomac school was founded a 
century ago and has grown from a small institution in D.C. to its large,
 90-acre grounds in Virginia.

Approximately 1,000
 students attend the school. The campus includes nature trails, outdoor classrooms, two gyms, squash courts and a large performing arts center.   

Potomac is a popular school with the children of Washington's political elite. Former students include Keshia Knight Pulliam who played Rudy Huxtable on The Cosby Show; Davis Guggenheim – director of An Inconvenient Truth and Rory Kennedy, filmmaker and daughter of RFK.

'We are deeply disturbed by this news
 and our hearts are with the entire Potomac community, past and present,
 as we work through this difficult time,' wrote Potomac School head 
Geoffrey Jones in a note to parents Friday that was reported by The 
Washington Post.

Kloman 
worked at the Potomac School from 1965 to 1994, police said.

The school 
confirmed he was both a teacher and an administrator and said in a 
statement Saturday that it is cooperating with Fairfax County's 
investigation.

A message left at a telephone listing for Kloman's home in McLean was not immediately returned on Saturday.

Kloman is being held at the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center, and the jail said he is set to appear in court today.

The Potomac School was founded in 1904 
and has students in kindergarten through 12th grade.
