A CNN anchor apologised to viewers after a correspondent covering the shooting of five black men in Tulsa, Okla., said 'n*****,' live on air.

It is the second time in recent weeks a CNN reporter has controversially used the term when quoting a subject in a live news report.

Susan Candiotti was reporting on the Good Friday shooting spree in Tulsa, in which a man randomly gunned down five black victims on the second anniversary of his father's death - he had been shot dead by an African American.

Jake England, 19, and his friend and alleged accomplice Alvin Watts, 32, both white, face murder charges over the shootings.

On Thursday, a day before the shootings, England took to his Facebook page to vent his anger about the man who shot him dead.

When quoting England's Facebook page in her news report on Sunday for CNN Newsroom, Susan Candiotti repeated the profanity he used.

'Today
is two years that my dad has been gone, shot by a f****** n*****.'

The network did blur the words out when it showed a graphic of the post.

Ms Candiotti had prefaced the comment by saying, 'Please excuse the language, it's very sensitive.'

At the end of Candiotti's report, anchor
Fredricka Whitfield said, 'We apologize to our viewers 
for the profanities used.'

Ms Candiotti later apologized, as well saying, 'In quoting someone else’s words, I repeated their offensive and inappropriate language. I deeply regret it.'

Criticism: Last month CNN reporter Drew Griffin said the n-word on live TV Thursday as he talked about a hate crime case

The move prompted an outcry from viewers who expressed shock at what they heard on CNN's Newsroom.

On Twitter users were critical of the decision to say the word.

One user wrote: ' Although she apologized before using the actual words, I can not believe Susan Candiotti said F'ing N on TV. GET OUT! Can she do that?'

Another said 'That is absolute insane. She is not a rookie reporter - she should know it's not right to say that on telly!'

Last month CNN reporter Drew Griffin said the n-word on live TV Thursday as he talked about a hate crime case.

Griffin was quoting the words used by Deryl Dedmon, a 19-year-old white Mississippi man convicted of hate crimes for running down black man with his truck and killing him.

Explaining the June killing of Craig Anderson, 47, Griffin says: 'Deryl Dedmond backs up and gets a good aim and just plows him over on the way out.

'To be absolutely factual, at the end of this, Deryl Dedmond is laughing with his friends and actually called on his cell phone and, pardon my language but there's no other way to say this, and said, "I just ran over that f*****g ******.'

Again it drew criticism from viewers who were shocked the term had been repeated on the network.
