A pensioner with a string of failed marriages behind him smothered his fifth wife with a pillow and then killed himself as he struggled to cope with another divorce, a coroner ruled today.

Chauffeur Terence Kirby, 72, and his wife, Myrna, 57, were found dead at their home in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, by their son, Freddie, at least 48 hours after their deaths.

An inquest heart that Mr Kirby, who had suffered depression and alcohol abuse in the months before he died, had lived apart from his wife of 30 years for two years. 

Senior Hertfordshire coroner Edward Thomas heard that Mrs Kirby, a carer and regular churchgoer, had filed for divorce in October 2012, three months before her and her husband's bodies were found.

Terence Kirby, 72, and his wife of 30 years, Myrna, 57, were found dead at home by their son, Freddie

Mr Kirby was admitted to Chase Farm Hospital in Enfield for treatment for depression.  He was regularly visited by his wife, and discharged in December 2012, two days before Christmas, to be cared for at home by his wife and community mental health workers.

The inquest heard that Freddie last heard from his mother on January 7 2013, and found their bodies at home four days later when he could not reach his mother by phone.

Philippines-born Mrs Kirby, who lived in nearby Waltham Cross, was found in bed with a pillow over her head, while her husband was dead in another room.

A post-mortem found low levels of alcohol in both bodies. Mr Kirby's cause of death was given as suspension, while his wife, who was said to have been dead 'for some time', and for longer than him, died from asphyxia with compression of the neck.

Mr Kirby's children questioned whether he should have been released from hospital, and if there was enough contact from community workers.

But health workers who visited the pair after his release reported the couple were 'comfortable' with one another despite his continued drinking. 

Mrs Kirby had been caring for her husband at home in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, as he battled depression

Michael Walker, consultant psychiatrist, told the coroner at the inquest in Hatfield that Mr Kirby was referred to him in November 2012 after telling his GP he felt suicidal, despite having no previous mental health problems.

'He had thoughts of hanging himself or a drug overdose, and it seemed to be because of the divorce,' he said.

'He was drinking at a harmful level, much more than is recommended, and he was felt to be a risk. He talked about a rope and knives.'

After Mr Kirby had been admitted to hospital, his wife told his doctors 'she could be scared of him when he shouted at her when he was drinking alcohol', the coroner said.

Mr Thomas added: 'She said that there had been ups and downs, and he could become very abusive and call her names, but they would get back together because she loved him.'

Mr Kirby's mood improved and he was discharged two days before Christmas, the inquest heard. 

Police officers arrive at the Kirbys' home shortly after their bodies were discovered in January last year

Between then and January 5, health crisis workers spoke to the Kirbys on several occasions, both over the telephone and during home visits.

Suzanne Bernardi, community psychiatric nurse, told the inquest Mrs Kirby had called on Boxing Day to say she had resisted her husband's request for more alcohol.

Regular contact was made over the next few days, and Mr Kirby was last visited by a member of the crisis team on January 5. On January 8, the team made a cold call but could not get a response from the house.

Two days later another visit was made but got no response, so on the afternoon of January 11 the police were asked to make a welfare check, shortly before Freddie discovered the bodies of his parents. 

Members of the family criticised the procedures followed by the crisis team, accusing them of 'gross incompetence' in managing the situation.

The couple's daughter, whose name was not given, said: 'The crisis team is called that for a reason.'

Hertfordshire Police found no evidence of any disturbance and neighbours didn't report hearing any loud arguments or aggression in the lead up to their deaths. 

Coroner Mr Thomas said: 'Mrs Kirby seems to have been very caring, he had a crisis and they had marital difficulties over the years.

'Clearly there was the impact on him of another failed relationship... What he had intimated was he did not want to get divorced.

'We will never know what actually happened on the day that she died, but we do know she had concerns about his drinking and he had a quantity of alcohol in his blood.'

He recorded a verdict that Mrs Kirby was unlawfully killed and Mr Kirby committed suicide afterwards.

'I think that he realised the enormity and sadness of what he had done, to someone who had actually been very supportive and come back to help him in a time of crisis,' said Mr Thomas.
