A woman was viciously beaten and thrown onto the tracks of the Philadelphia subway in a shocking  random attack in broad daylight on Tuesday.

Surveillance video of the incident at the Chinatown station shows the man in a hooded jacket suddenly pouncing on his 23-year-old female victim sitting alone on the station platform, CBSNews reports.

The attacker, whose face is also partially covered, approaches the woman asking for a light.

But when she hands over the lighter he moves in closer repeatedly punching her in the head and grabbing her ankles.

Horrifying: A man was caught on surveillance video attacking a woman on the Philadelphia subway. He punches the woman before dragging her by her feet onto the track

He then forcefully pulls the woman off the platform bench, dragging her by her feet across the platform before throwing her onto the tracks.

He is the caught on camera looking back at the woman as he picks up her discarded mobile phone off the seat and coolly walks away.

The woman could have been electrocuted or killed by an oncoming train in the attack that took place at 2.30pm, but she luckily manages to pull herself off the tracks without injury before a train arrives at the station.

The victim, who asked to remain anonymous, told CBSNews: ‘By the time I zipped my jacket back up, that's when he was on me, on my neck. I was just telling him, 'I don't have no money,' and he was just like, 'Shut up.' "

Thrown: The woman was thrown onto the Subway tracks but was lucky there were no oncoming trains. She said she 'tried to fight back' but couldn't overcome his grasp

'I started trying to fight him back, and kick just as much as I could. And he grabbed me by the legs. He seemed fine, he didn't seem like he was crazy.

'I am so happy that a train didn't come on either side, because I don't know what 
would have happened then.'

Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority Police Chief, Thomas Nestel, told NBCNews: 'It's horrifying. When you see that happen, you think the worst. We all know that there is a tremendous electric source. You touch that, you die.'

Homeless William Clark was arrested in connection to the incident yesterday.

Walks away: The man coolly walked away from the scene occasionally looking back to check on his victim. William Clark was arrested by police yesterday

The police chief took to Twitter to congratulate a female officer for apprehending the suspect.

He said Sgt Nicole Lawson was the ‘hero of the day’.

However, questions have been raised over whether police should have warned the public in the two days prior to Clark's arrest.

Nestel has defended his force saying that distributing the video sooner would have interfered with their investigation. He said patrols were stepped up at the station.

The victim suffered only bumps and bruises.

The incident comes just weeks after two random New York Subway attacks where victims were killed after being pushed into the paths of oncoming trains.

Ki-Suk Han, 58, was shoved off the 
platform to a horrific death at 49th street station on December 3. 

Homeless 
Naeem Davis, 30, has admitted to the attack

On December 28, Sunando Sen, 46, died after being pushed in front of a subway train in Queens.

Erica Menendez, a 31-year-old woman who suffered from bi-polar disorder, has been deemed fit to stand trial for his murder.
