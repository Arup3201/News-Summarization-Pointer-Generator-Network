When banker Keith Owen was diagnosed with cancer and given only eight weeks to live, he started to think of ways to leave his mark.

In the end he said it with flowers – one million of them to be precise – leaving them to the seaside town he had fallen in love with.

Shortly before his death, Mr Owen, 69, a Canadian citizen, took the astonishingly generous decision to change his will and leave his £2.3million fortune to Sidmouth in Devon.

Improvement: Sidmouth in Devon has received £2.3million to help beautify the seaside town

Planting: One million flower bulbs are set to be planted throughout the town thanks to Keith Owen

Generous: The banker left £2.3million to the town in his will when he died in December 2007

His
one condition was that the money should be spent on keeping the town 
‘beautiful’, and he suggested residents should embark on a project to 
plant one million bulbs.

Now
Mr Owen’s dying wish is about to become reality as the community 
prepares to plant 153,000 flowers – or nearly ten for each of the town’s
17,000 residents – in the first phase of a massive operation. 

Mr Owen was born in nearby Totnes. He became an RAF pilot, but in 1976 moved to Canada where he worked as an investment banker.

He
would regularly return for holidays in Sidmouth, where his mother 
retired, describing it as the picture-perfect English resort.

Scenic: Parks, gardens and verges are all benefiting from the work funded by Mr Owen's bequest

Bulbs: Officials have now started the work of planting a million flowers as Mr Owen suggested

Project: Staff at the Sidmouth Garden Centre have been stockpiling a huge number of bulbs

He
even became a member of the Rotary club and supporter of the Sid Vale 
Association, Britain’s oldest civic society founded in 1846.

Then
on a trip to the UK in 2007, he was given the devastating news he had 
lung cancer. He urgently gathered civic leaders to discuss the gift 
before changing his will.

Mr
Owen, who was divorced with no children, left £1.5million in cash and 
£800,000 in property to the SVA after his death in early 2008.

The
will stated that the capital should remain untouched but each year the 
estimated £120,000 interest should be spent on sprucing up Sidmouth and 
the nearby villages of Sidford and Sidbury.

Beloved: Mr Owen's mother lived in Sidmouth and he loved spending his holidays in the town

Devoted: The money to plant flowers and carry out other projects came from a portfolio of investments and property

Around
£400,000 of Mr Owen’s money has already been spent on youth projects, 
including a new scout hut.

Now volunteers are getting ready to complete 
the first phase of the planting project, sowing £166,000 worth of 
daffodils, snowdrops, crocuses and other bulbs.

The
153,000 flowers will be planted during a special community day in two 
months’ time, with Sidmouth Garden Centre stockpiling the bulbs in 
preparation.

Alan Darrant, 
chairman of the SVA, said: ‘Keith spoke in detail about the kind of 
things he wanted the money spent on. On one occasion he said, “Think of 
things that will get everyone together – I don’t know, plant a million 
bulbs”.

‘So we’re going to do exactly that. We will be planting the bulbs at over 50 sites – roadsides, park land and public gardens.

‘We can then sit back and, in spring, see what has sprung.’

Picturesque: Sidmouth attracts more than 100,000 visitors each year to its scenic beaches

Pretty: The town's Victorian architecture has been a draw for visitors for decades
