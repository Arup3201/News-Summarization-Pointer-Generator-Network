Victims of crime will be told to go to Tesco to get help as the shutters
at more than one in five police stations are brought down to cut costs.

Chief constables will close 264 public counters over the next three years as they battle to balance the books.

Residents will instead be encouraged to travel to supermarkets, 
libraries and community centres if they want to speak to officers 
face-to-face.

Savings: 'Shared locations', like Rainham Police Office in a Tesco car park in Essex, will replace stations

A further 179 police buildings which have no public access will be sold off in an unprecedented fire sale of assets.

Senior officers argued that the blow of the police station closures will
be softened as 137 so-called ‘shared locations’ open their doors.

They highlighted how many buildings were out of date and said fewer 
people visit police stations as they turn to the phone and internet. 
Some forces, such as Kent, Surrey, Essex, Cumbria and Gwent, were 
already using mobile police stations in supermarket car parks.

But critics have accused police of withdrawing from landmark high street buildings in many towns and cities simply to cut costs.

Simon Reed, vice-chairman of the Police Federation, lashed out at forces
for closing ‘places of refuge’ for crime victims. He said: ‘These 
drop-in centres are no substitute for a proper police station and for a 
lot of people they are not the answer.

Axe: 5,800 frontline police officers face the axe over the next three years because of Government spending cuts

‘In many cases they have taken away a police station and given the 
public a part-time office in a supermarket or a mobile home left in a 
car park.

‘The public want a police station with full facilities, a place of 
refuge and safety. What we are doing is abandoning this and providing a 
drop-in point instead.’

The closures were disclosed yesterday in a report by a police watchdog 
into how police forces in England and Wales are coping with tighter 
budgets.

Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary found crime continues to fall
and confidence in police remains high despite substantial cuts in 
government funding.

Its report said the total police workforce will fall by 32,400 officers and staff by 2015.

Among these will be 5,800 frontline officers although many forces have 
reorganised to put a larger proportion of bobbies on the beat.

However, Paul McKeever, of the Police Federation, argued that some 
forces have simply created a ‘smokescreen’ by moving officers to the 
front line from other important roles.

He added: ‘Whichever way you cut it, the resilience of the police 
service to be able to react to whatever is thrown at it is being 
threatened.’

Funding black hole: The Metropolitan Police still have to make a further £233million worth of funding cuts

Spending on equipment and services will also be cut by about £474million
as chief constables look to reorganise and share contracts to save 
cash.

Sir Denis O’Connor, Chief Inspector of Constabulary, argued that  forces
can save the jobs of dozens of police officers by selling off costly 
buildings.

He said: ‘The police station and front counter have traditionally been the physical mainstay of forces’ presence in communities.

‘However, the potential savings benefit to a force in shrinking its 
estate can be considerable. One reports it will save £500,000 in 2013/14
rising to £1.6million in 2014/15.’

He said the frontline officers he 
has met are ‘cracking on with the mission’, working imaginatively to 
maintain services whatever difficulties they face.

The latest cuts figures do not include Britain’s biggest force, the Met,
which has not produced detailed budget plans or officer numbers.

Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe is reassembling his management team 
following a string of  resignations and a shake-up of how the force is 
overseen. Officials warned his force was in danger of severe failings 
when cuts bite after the Olympics and it already has a budget shortfall 
of more than £233million.

Two other forces, Lincolnshire and Devon & Cornwall, were also 
singled out as potentially failing to provide an ‘efficient and 
effective’ service in the future.

Chief Constable Steve Finnigan, of the Association of Chief Police 
Officers, said: ‘We are becoming more flexible in the way we deliver 
critical services such as neighbourhood policing, local response teams 
and investigative work.’

Policing minister Nick Herbert defended the cuts, saying: ‘This report 
makes it clear that the frontline of policing is being protected overall
and that the service to the public has largely been maintained.’
