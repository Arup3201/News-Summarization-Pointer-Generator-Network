Ranbir Singh Suri, who is chairman of the Oceanic Jewellers Ltd, is to be made a Lord, it has emerged

The row over ‘cash for peerages’ was reignited last night after it emerged a jewellery tycoon who has handed the Tories more than £300,000 is to be made a Lord.

Ranbir Singh Suri – last night nicknamed the ‘King of Bling’ by Labour sources – was nominated by David Cameron. 

The Prime Minister has already handed out 161 peerages in this parliament.

The announcement that another political crony is to be handed a peerage will lead to further calls for the controversial system of patronage which persists in this country to be scrapped. 

About 20 new peers are expected to be announced today, swelling the total to 850, making the House of Lords bigger than at any time since most of the hereditaries were removed in 1999.

And it emerged that the expenses bill for the House of Lords has risen by more than £4million since 2010.

According to Lords figures, the cost of peers’ allowances has risen from to £21.6million from £17.2million before the 2010 election.

The new peers will increase the bill even further. Based on an average expense claim of £28,000, they could add £600,000 to the bill.

Constitutional experts warn that the handing of peerages to dozens of political allies and donors is ‘unsustainable’.

Paul Flynn, Labour member of the public administration select committee, said: ‘Our legislature is being prostituted; jobs are being given out to the highest donors.

‘The Lords is overcrowded as it is, only two thirds of them can get in.’

About half of the 20 or so peerages to be announced tomorrow will be for the Conservatives. The Prime Minister is expected to hand peerages to Apprentice star Karren Brady and former M&S boss Sir Stuart Rose.

Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg will also name peers to represent Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the Lords – leading to claims they are being promoted to act as ‘lobby fodder’.

David Cameron is preparing to announce up to 20 new appointments to the House of Lords tomorrow

Former M&S boss Sir Stuart Rose and West Ham vice-chairman and Apprentice star Karren Brady are expected to become peers in the new list of nominations

Ed Miliband will name former EastEnders actor and Labour MEP Michael Cashman, while Nick Clegg is expected to name a total of six.

Last night Alistair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said: ‘It is absurd to keep adding to our overblown second chamber through nominations from the PM – particularly as many of the nominees seem to be big donors to the Conservatives.

‘No other second chamber in the Western World is so large. Every democrat should be pressing for a reform of the House of Lords as a matter of urgency.’

While the very idea of parties cramming the Upper House with political appointees is controversial, the idea that donors should be given seats is even more so. 

It has also been rumoured that Michael Farmer, a City financier who has donated more than £2.3million to the Tories since 2002, is also in line for a peerage. He was appointed the Tory co-treasurer in 2012.

Ranbir Singh Suri is chairman of Oceanic Jewellers Ltd and founder of the British Asian Conservative Link, which aimed to encourage those with an Asian background to get involved in politics.

Official figures show that since 2010 the bill for peers' expenses has risen from £17.2 million to £21.6million

Former Eastenders actor Michael Cashman, a Labour MEP since 1999, is expected to be nominated as a peer by Ed Miliband 

Since 2006 he has donated £129,380 to the Conservative party, while his company has given them another £183,055. Reported to be worth £40million, he has been a Tory member for more than 30 years.

Tory sources said he was a leading figure in the Sikh community who had served as a magistrate for a decade and a half. He was also a successful businessman who employs dozens.

He will join Miss Brady, who last year introduced Chancellor George Osborne before his speech to the party’s annual conference.

Now the 44-year-old vice-chairman of West Ham football club, she was working as an advertising executive for radio station LBC when she was hired by Sunday Sport publisher David Sullivan. Mr Sullivan made his fortune through adult magazines before founding the downmarket newspaper in 1986.

At the age of 23, she was made managing director of Birmingham FC after Mr Sullivan and his business partner David Gold took over the football club in 1993. She remained there until 2009.
