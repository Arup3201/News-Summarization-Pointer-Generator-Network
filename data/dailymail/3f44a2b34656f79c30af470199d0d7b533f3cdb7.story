Manchester City take a break from their revitalised title challenge to begin their latest FA Cup quest this weekend.

The Barclays Premier League champions host Sky Bet Championship side Sheffield Wednesday in the third round of the knockout competition on Sunday.

It is the second time City have faced the Owls this season, having thrashed them 7-0 in the Capital One Cup in September.

Now City are in even greater form having gone unbeaten in their last 12 games, winning 10 of them.

Their hot sequence has seen them claw back an eight-point deficit to draw level with Chelsea in the Premier League and reach the knockout stages of the Champions League.

It seems a daunting task for Wednesday but, coming soon after the draining Christmas programme, manager Manuel Pellegrini is taking nothing for granted.

The Chilean said: 'It has been a difficult moment because we played three games in a week, very important games in the Premier League.

'We had to play for nine points in one week but we have finished that and now we must think about Sheffield Wednesday.

'For our team it is a very important cup. Last year we were eliminated here against Wigan but we won the Capital One Cup.

'This year we are eliminated from the Capital One so we will try to continue in the FA Cup as far as we can.'

City were knocked out by Wigan in the last year and the Pellegrini is determined not to see a repeat

City were knocked out of the Capital One Cup by Newcastle in October amid a poor spell that saw them win just once in six games.

That brought scrutiny of Pellegrini and his methods but doubts appear to have been swept away by City's form since the November international break. It was at a similar stage last season when City began to click into top gear.

Pellegrini said: 'For different reasons we had a low performance for around two weeks.

'We were not playing so bad in that moment but we made important mistakes and when you make mistakes the score is not what you want. After that, we arranged again the way we were playing.

'Important players returned to their normal performance and I am very happy with the way we are playing now.

'We still have so many injured players but we arrange in different ways and continue winning.'

Vincent Kompany is nearing a return but won't be fit in time for the third round clash

Joe Hart could be on the sidelines again this weekend with Pellegrini hinting Willy Caballero will retain his place

Influential captain Vincent Kompany and strikers Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko are the key players currently sidelined.

Kompany is thought to be the closest to a return after calf and hamstring problems but has been ruled out of the Wednesday clash. Dzeko and Aguero are expected to return later in January.

Midfielder Yaya Toure could face Wednesday in what would be his final appearance before joining up with Ivory Coast for the African Nations Cup.

Pellegrini has hinted that second-choice goalkeeper Willy Caballero is likely to remain in the side after England number one Joe Hart was rested against Sunderland on New Year's Day.

Pellegrini said: 'It is important when you play so many games - not only for Joe but for other players - to have an important rotation.

'I did the same in the Capital One for Willy Caballero. I think it's good for Willy, good for Joe and good for the team. It's exactly the same as other positions in the team.'
