Will Real Madrid retain the Champions League?

Gareth Bale wrote his name into European Cup final history on Saturday night as he set Real Madrid on their way to an extra-time victory against Atletico.

The Welshman helped the Spanish giants claim their 10th European triumph in his first season with the club following his staggering £86million move from Tottenham last summer.

Anyone who doubted Bale's abilities and whether he'd be able to conquer Europe with Real have been proved wrong. The header which saw Real Madrid crowned Champions of Europe once more has repaid the faith shown in him by the Bernabeu hierarchy. Bale has justified that fee.

Speaking to Sky Sports after one of the 
greatest night's of his career so far, Bale said: 'The price tag means 
nothing. This is why I came here, to win big competitions and it's paid 
off. Lifting the trophy is a feeling you can’t describe.'

Question marks were raised over such a huge fee but ask anybody linked with Real Madrid and every one will insist it was money well spent.

Madrid went on to win 4-1 courtesy of a Marcelo strike and Ronaldo penalty but it was Bale who set them on their way, heading home at the backpost to nod Carlo Ancelotti's men in front.

'I was thinking do not miss! Literally, do not miss!' said Bale, who luckily kept his calm during such a huge moment.

Bale's used to keeping his calm and producing when the stakes are high and the pressure is on. Last season, the No 11 was the match-winner on countless occassions for Spurs in the Premier League.

Tottenham's talisman gave defences nightmares and just couldn't stop scoring screamers. Bale made his brilliance look simple, as the world's best players tend to.

Twelve months on, and the 24 year-old was helping Madrid claim their first Champions League win in 12 years.

Big games need big players and Bale is certainly a world-class star. Admittedly, Real's deadly duo of Bale and Ronaldo had a quiet night by their standards but duly stepped up when it mattered.

Nobody will remember the match as a game when Bale wasn't at his best. They'll simply remember his extra-time goal which helped his side finally achieve La Decima.

'I had a little feeling things were not going my way after missing chances! But I’ve learnt from past experiences to forget chances missed and keep persevering. Thankfully I got the decisive goal which  gave us momentum in the last 10 minutes,' said Bale.

Lifting the Champions League trophy in Lisbon, the former Southampton graduate has come along way. After all, Bale was nearly sold by Tottenham after failing to make the desired impact during his first few seasons at White Hart Lane.

The feeling of achievement - the sense he was living the dream - was clear to see as Bale walked past the coveted trophy with a beaming smile on his face.

The wideman showed his class on Saturday and proved to the football world just why Real Madrid parted with such a vast sum of money in order to secure his services. The man is a match-winner.

Lifting the Champions League trophy alongside Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos, Bale now belongs on that platform.

Madrid's Prince of Wales has now joined a long illustrious list of Real greats - Puskas, Di Stefano, Raul, Zidane, Ronaldo, Bale.
