A student from China was scammed into giving a taxi driver from Chicago O’Hare airport $4420 for a taxi journey that should have cost less than $300.

The University of Illinois student who did not know very much English, was lied to by the driver who told him that there were no more buses heading to the town of Champaign, Illinois that evening.

The 18-year-old Chinese student was approached by a driver in the arrivals hall of O'Hare airport and offered to take the student to the university campus some 150 miles away for $1,000.

Upon arriving at the campus, the cabbie demanded $4,800 for the journey.

Unfair fare: A Chinese student was charged $4,800 for a 150-mile ride from Chicago O'Hare airport to his university campus at Champaign, Illionois

Right rip-off: The journey should have cost just under $300 for the 150 mile trip, but the cabby had other ideas...

‘The student said he didn't have that much so he gave him all he had,’ University of Illinois police Sgt. Tom Geis told the News-Gazette.

Chicago police are now looking for the driver.

The International Student and Scholar Services program at the University of Illinois asked the student as to why he trusted the taxi driver and why he was carrying such a large amount of money in the first place.

‘It's hard to know why this would have happened,’ Julie Misa, director of the program said.

Touting for business: The driver approached the student in the arrivals hall after picking up his bag and initially agreed to a $1,000 fare for the trip

The university website recommends students a number of ways to get to the campus including a bus which costs around $30.

A web site designed to book taxi rides, worldtaximeter.com, says that riders should expect to pay $290 for a cab from O'Hare to Champaign, a 150 mile trip.
