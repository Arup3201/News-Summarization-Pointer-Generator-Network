Tens of thousands of Ukrainian nationals are having their British visas rubber-stamped in just ten minutes, an official report reveals today.

Despite the country being rated as ‘high-risk’ from fraudulent applications, visitor visas were being waved through without proper checks, inspectors found.

John Vine, the chief inspector of Borders and Immigration, found refusal rates had plummeted to just 4 per cent.

The findings emerged in a highly critical report into the visa processing centre in Warsaw, Poland. It handles about 56,000 applications a year, of which more than 36,000 are visitor visa applications from the Ukraine.

Thousands of Ukrainians, who have recently been protesting against their Government's decision to suspend Ukraine's European integration (pictured), are having their visas rubber-stamped in just 10 minutes

Anyone given a visitor visa can enter Britain for a set period of time, but there are scant checks on whether they leave the country at the end.

Ukraine is not part of the EU so its nationals have no rights to come to Britain and cannot work unless given specific permission. The report will raise concerns that thousands are getting in, staying and working in the black economy.

The report found inexperienced and temporary staff were under pressure to clear 45 applications a day – the equivalent of one every ten minutes.

As a result, document checks designed to prove if migrants were genuine visitors – or trying to enter the country permanently – were not carried out.

Managers were breaking rules suggesting they should review one in five cases, and in a three-month period, only 3 per cent were given additional scrutiny.

Mr Vine criticised the ‘poor quality’ of decision making in the Visa Section. He said it was of ‘serious concern’ that so little attention was paid to quality assurance of decisions made by entry clearance officers who process visa applications. And he cited the ‘real risk that visa decisions were being taken without the necessary checks being conducted’.

Security assessments suggested Ukraine applications were ‘high risk’ because they were often backed by forged or counterfeit documents. But applications from Ukraine were much less likely to be refused than those from low-risk countries.

The report said: ‘We were surprised to find that the refusal rate for Kiev was significantly lower than for other posts in the region.

‘We would have expected a post which the risk profile indicated was a high risk and which reportedly received a high number of applications that were not genuine, to have a refusal rate exceeding that of spoke locations deemed to present a lower risk.’

Inspectors found the refusal rate fell from 14 per cent in October 2012 to just 4 per cent in June this year.

It cited as reasons the hiring of temporary and inexperienced staff and the increase in processing targets ‘meaning that officers may not have had enough time to conduct further research on applications or conduct verification checks in all required cases’.

The centre also processes visa requests from non-EU nationals living in other parts of Eastern and Central Europe, such as Romania and Austria.

Mr Vine added: ‘It is vitally important, if the visa application process is to be fair and transparent, that the Home Office corrects these serious failings in its decision making.’

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Protecting the border is our  top priority.  The UK is not a member of the European free movement zone and so visa holders have their visas and documentation checked again at the border.

‘We have reviewed the cases highlighted by the Chief Inspector, and we are satisfied that no individual was issued with a visa when they should not have been.’

* At least 385,000 Romanian and Bulgarian migrants will arrive in Britain over the next five years, a report claimed last night.

The Democracy Institute think-tank said the real total would ‘significantly surpass’ current estimates of how many will come when working restrictions end on January 1.

Its report suggests an average of 77,000 Romanians and Bulgarians will come to the UK annually, made up of 44,000 Bulgarians and 33,000 Romanians.

The report’s author Patrick Basham wrote: ‘This paper’s unexpected finding is that the most alarming of the forecasts is actually insufficiently alarmist.’

The report says Britain is attractive to educated and skilled migrants who want to earn more, but also to a ‘not insignificant’ group of unskilled and uneducated migrants who ‘avail themselves of the smorgasbord of government-provided benefits’.

It criticises the UK for creating a ‘self-inflicted economic migrant own goal’ as a result of its over- generous welfare spending.

Hitting back: Mariana Campeanu says British workers would rather live off benefits than take low-paid jobs

Britain should be grateful to Romanians and Bulgarians for taking jobs shunned by local workers, according to a Romanian government minister.

Mariana Campeanu, the country’s labour minister, said many British workers would rather live off benefits than take jobs picking fruit or working in hotels.

Her comments came as London Mayor Boris Johnson became the most senior politician to back the call for restrictions on workers from both countries to be extended beyond January 1.

David Cameron has announced restrictions on new arrivals from the EU claiming benefits.

But in an interview with The Times, Mrs Campeanu said it was generous welfare payments to Britons which left open thousands of low-paid jobs for migrants. She said: ‘British people do not access the vacancies on the labour market for which Romanian citizens, for example, are going to apply.

‘If there are any vacancies, somebody will fill them, whether they are from Romania, Italy, Spain or wherever.’

‘Taking into account the fact that Romanian citizens in the UK contribute greatly to the GDP and also that many of these people are young and well qualified, the UK should be grateful that these people have come to live there.’

About 22,000 Romanians and Bulgarians work in the UK in the summer picking fruit and vegetables – and tens of thousands more are self-employed or have visas to take jobs in health and social care.

Last night Home Secretary Theresa May made clear her determination to change EU free movement rules – and suggested ministers could put a ‘cap’ on overall migrant numbers.

Ahead of a meeting of EU ministers, Mrs May said: ‘I will make clear that I believe we need to change the way free movement rules work. Looking ahead, we must seize the opportunity presented by the Prime Minister’s plan to reform the EU and address the problems caused by free movement.’

Mr Johnson, speaking on LBC radio, said he would like the extension of the block on benefit claims to ‘go for six or 12 months’ because of competition for jobs that left ‘many young Londoners who feel they are not getting a fair suck of the sauce bottle’.

He urged Mr Cameron to push for such changes in the EU.
