While most expectant moms fret over decorating the nursery in the weeks leading up to their baby's delivery, Sharon Savino had a more pressing matter on her mind - the egg-sized tumor growing in her heart.

The 26-year-old Long Island, New York resident noticed something was wrong when she developed a cough before Christmas.

When she coughed up blood, she went to the emergency room near her home and doctors first diagnosed her with bronchitis - saying they didn't know what caused the blood.

But when the bleeding happened again, she went to an obstetrician who found the dangerous egg-sized tumor.

While the tumor was not malignant, because of its size it had the potential to cause organ damage, a stroke or even sudden death.

So doctors at Stony Brook University Hospital had a choice: either perform open heart surgery while Savino was still carrying the child, or perform a c-section pre-term and wait for the mom to heal before addressing the tumor.

In the end, doctors decided that the situation was too risky and on January 17, at 27 weeks pregnant, Savino underwent open-heart surgery.

The dangers with performing open-heart surgery on a pregnant woman is that the heart-lung bypass machine can impair blood flow to the fetus. The stress of the surgery can also cause the patient to go into premature labor.

Operating on a pregnant woman is so rare, doctors only found 17 other cases.

While patients usually spend about 45 minutes on the hearty-lung machine and about 25 to 30 minutes with their heart stopped during surgery, they cut those times in half for Savino and her unborn baby.

'For Sharon, we were able to reduce that to 18 minutes on the machine with her heart arrested for only 12 minutes,' Dr James Taylor told the New York Daily News.

Tayor says Savino was a model patient who kept stress under control throughout the process.

She says the weight of the surgery didn't hit her until she was just about to go into the operating room.

'Then it hit me, and I started crying. My mom was there, she started crying. I guess it wasn't real to me before then,' she said.

Doctors at Stony Brook University Hospital decided the tumor was too dangerous to wait until after Savino's c-section so they operated while she was pregnant

The surgery went off without a hitch and Ms Savino remained in the hospital for a week after surgery while she was monitored for signs of preterm labor.

She spent the remaining two months at home before giving birth to baby Maximus on April 2.

Savino and partner Russell Daniels, 27, now have three children together including Maximus' older brother and sister Russell, 4, and Shallyssa, 2.

'I thought, "I can't believe I made it,"' Savino said. 'He's healthy, and I'm still going.'
