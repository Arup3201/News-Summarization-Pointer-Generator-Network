Complaint: Lisa Bowden says she needs a new council house because someone died in her flat

A jobless mother is demanding a new council home after she complained that a previous tenant had died in hers – which she says offends her gipsy culture.

Lisa Bowden, who has not worked in 15 years and collects around £13,000 a year in benefits, was given her current newly-decorated two-bedroom flat two months ago.

But she discovered that a man had died there, and claims it is against her culture to live where someone has passed away.

Miss Bowden, 40, who has four children by two fathers, said she can feel the presence of the deceased man’s ‘spirit’ and insisted that Dartford Borough Council move her to a three- bedroom house with a garden.

Neighbours branded her a ‘freeloader’.

The former traveller, whose flat in the pretty Kent village of Stone, near Dartford, is equipped with mod cons, said: ‘When someone dies from a gipsy culture, we would burn the caravan.

‘It is forbidden for us to enter somewhere where someone has died. It doesn’t matter that the man who died here was not a gipsy. I can feel his spirit and it gives me the shivers.

'I can’t live here – I always sleep with the light on and would never stay at night on my own. The council need to give me a new home – one with a garden and three bedrooms so my daughter can visit.’

Miss Bowden lives with her nine-year-old son, while her 15-year-old daughter lives with her father, Miss Bowden’s ex-husband. Her other children have left home.

She gets £70 weekly employment and support allowance, and £60 a week in child tax credits. She also receives £80 a month in child benefit, and her £90 weekly rent is paid for by the taxpayer.

Demands: Ms Bowden was given her current two-bedroom flat in Stone, near Dartford, two months ago

Home: Ms Bowden inside the living room of the taxpayer-funded flat, which is equipped with mod cons

Demand: The mother of four says it is against travellers' beliefs to live in a home where someone has died

Her house has two flat-screen 
televisions, a PlayStation 3 console, a Nintendo Wii, a new sofabed and a
 new microwave, kettle and toaster. At Christmas she bought her 
nine-year-old a laptop computer.

When
 she was given the flat in October, the council gave her nearly £200 to 
redecorate, and she got a new bathroom and kitchen. Miss Bowden said she
 had called in a priest in an attempt to exorcise her flat, but claims 
she can still ‘smell the death’ inside it.

She
 claims her ‘haunted’ flat  is making worse a long-standing lung 
condition, and was recently admitted to hospital for a chest infection. 
She added: ‘I told them I didn’t want a flat where someone died, but 
they didn’t listen and told me either I take the flat or I end up on the
 street.’

One neighbour 
said: ‘She’s so ungrateful. Beggars can’t be choosers. Nobody should 
turn their nose up at a free flat, even if someone has died in it. It’s 
not like he is still in there.’

Before
 her present home, Miss Bowden lived in nearby Thamesmead with a 
partner, before leaving him and ending up in a shelter. Prior to that, 
she lived in Kent in a council-owned home with her first husband, whom 
she married aged 16.

Matthew
 Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Many 
people will find it difficult to believe a council could be accused of 
mistreating someone by providing a taxpayer-funded council house.’

Joseph Jones, spokesman for the Gypsy Council of Great Britain, said: ‘I think everyone has their own take on gipsy rules.

‘She
 is right that when someone dies in a caravan it’s traditional to lay 
them to rest then burn the caravan. I think it’s important everyone’s 
religious beliefs don’t count against them.’

A Dartford Borough Council spokesman said: ‘We have no plans to rehome her. We have no further comment.’

Not enough: The mother of four has insisted that Dartford Borough Council move her to a house with a garden

Lisa Bowden is the latest in a series of council house tenants who have demanded to be moved to a better home.

The best-known is Heather Frost, an unemployed mother of 11 who lived in two council houses in Churchdown, Gloucestershire but complained that they were too small for her.

Her local council agreed to build her a new six-bedroom eco-house in order to house the whole family.

Demand: Heather Frost had a new home built for her because she could not fit her 11 children in her house

However, she attracted public outrage when it emerged that she owned a horse on which she spent about £200 a month.

Ms Frost also used benefits money to pay for her unemployed partner to take flying lessons.

A documentary crew later filmed her apparently buying stolen groceries from door-to-door salesmen, prompting her to claim that 'everybody has to get their goods off shoplifters'.

In October, mother of nine Cheryl Prudham, from Sittingbourne in Kent, said she needed a larger house to fit her whole family.

Complaint: Cheryl and Robert Prudham said they needed a larger home because they could not stop having children

Family: Maggie and Gavin Flisher said they needed a new home for themselves and their six children

She and husband Robert earned more than £50,000 tax-free from benefits and part-time work, but she said they could not stop having children because they disliked contraception.

And this summer, Maggie Flisher demanded a new council house because she is 'super-fertile', meaning she and husband Gavin had six children.

She said she had tried using contraception, but had been unable to stop herself getting pregnant again.

Now she wants to be moved because she can 'feel the man's spirit' and says if she lived in a caravan it would be burned in similar circumstances
