Confirmed: The Conservatives have named Maria Hutchings, who lost to Mr Huhne in 2010, as their candidate

A mother who challenged Tony Blair on live TV has been named as the Tory candidate in the battle for Chris Huhne’s seat.

Maria Hutchings was last night confirmed as the Conservative challenger in the Eastleigh by-election triggered by the resignation of disgraced former Cabinet minister Huhne.

She needs to over-turn a Lib Dem majority of more than 3,000, but a poll last night put the Tories three points ahead.

Both David Cameron and Nick Clegg know doubts about their leadership will grow if they are defeated in the vote on February 28.

Mrs Hutchings, 51, made headlines in 2005 when she ambushed Mr Blair during a live TV debate.

She confronted the Labour PM on Five’s The Wright Stuff about the closure of special schools and the link between autism and the MMR jab.

Clutching a photo of her autistic son John Paul, she called on him to provide more support for children with learning disabilities.

The former Labour supporter yelled ‘Tony that's rubbish’ before studio workers intervened.

Soon after the 2005 general election, which Labour won, she met David Cameron, who was then Tory education spokesman.

The pair shared their experience of bringing up children with special needs, and she helped launch a Tory pamphlet on the subject.

Mrs Hutchings became a member of Mr Cameron’s controversial A-List of high-flying Tory candidates, and was regularly included in lists of female wannabe MPs dubbed Cameron’s Cuties.

She battled against Huhne in Eastleigh at the 2010 election, but the Lib Dems increased their majority from 568 to 3,864.

Mrs Hutchings said: 'We need a local MP we can trust - someone who will support people who work hard and do the right thing.

'Although I may not be a professional politician, I'm a 
straight-talking businesswoman and mother of four who lives in the local
area.'

The Tories have been warned not to expect a direct boost in support from Huhne's fall from grace.

Maria Hustings was the Tory candidate in Eastleigh in the 2010 general election, when Chris Huhne increase his majority.

Chris Huhne (Liberal Democrat) 46.5%

Maria Hutchings (Conservative) 39.3%

Leo Barraclough (Labour) 9.6%

Ray Finch (UKIP) 3.6%

Tony Pewsey (English Democrats) 0.5%

Dave Stone (Independent) 0.3%

Keith Low (National Liberal Party) 0.2%

Lib Dem majority 3,864   

Today Mrs Hutchings said she would not focus on her one-time rival's downfall.

'We are running a clean campaign. I want to talk about the issues that affect the people of Eastleigh,' she said.

'I do not want to talk about Chris Huhne - that issue is in the past.'

Former Tory Treasurer Lord Ashcroft warned
his party that though it started the contest in the lead, his polling 
suggested few voters were likely to 'switch out of disgust'.

The survey conducted for the peer in the immediate wake of Huhne's 
resignation put the Tories on 34 per cent, with Lib Dems on 31 per cent, Labour on 19 per cent 
and UKIP fourth with 13 per cent.

Tory party chairman Grant Shapps will start a big Tory push in the seat today, unveiling the first poster of the campaign.

He has made clear the Tories will target Mr Huhne’s lies about passing his speeding points to his ex-wife.

‘For too long the people of Eastleigh have been let down by an MP who was being less than straightforward,’ he said. ‘Residents will take a dim view about having been lied to by their Lib Dem MP.’

The Lib Dems are due to select their candidate at a meeting tomorrow, with the party expected to choose a local councillor. All 36 councillors in the constituency is a Lib Dem.

Both parties predict the by-election contest will be brutal, because the stakes for the two leaders are so high.

Mr Clegg said: 'I think the choice for the people of Eastleigh in the by-election is what kind of an MP do they want to have now.

'I hope that it will be on that basis rather than in a mood or spirit of retribution that the debate will be conducted in Eastleigh.'

He sought to draw a clear distinction with his Westminster coalition partners by highlighting the Lib Dem commitment to a 1% annual 'mansion tax' on £2 million-plus properties to fund tax cuts for "hard-pressed families" - a proposal the Tories have consistently rejected.

Labour sources are hoping for a strong showing, but privately accept they have little chances of winning despite being nine points up on their 2010 showing in the Ashcroft-commissioned poll.

In a bitter twist for ED Miliband, if the Labour vote holds up by taking votes from the Lib Dems it could gift the seat to David Cameron.

An opinion poll in the Eastleigh seat, carried out for former Tory fundraiser Lord Ashcroft, put the Conservatives three points ahead of the Lib Dems

Lord Ashcroft's poll showed a fall of almost 16 points in Lib Dem support since the 2010 general election, when Huhne scooped 46.5 per cent of the vote.Tories are down five points since the election and Labour and UKIP both up nine.

While Tory voters were the most committed to the party and the party was most likely to attract wavering Lib Dems, Labour voters were the most open to switching and preferred the Lib Dems.

And two-thirds of those taking part in the poll agreed that "the Lib Dems do a good job locally in my area", where the party dominates the local council with 40 out of 44 seats.

'Huhne was a popular and, by all accounts, assiduous MP, and many in Eastleigh will be sad to see him go and circumstances of his departure," Lord Ashcroft cautioned.

'The Tories should not expect many to switch out of disgust,' he added, predicting a 'bruising - but fascinating' contest.

Senior Labour MP John Denham said: 'In this campaign the Lib Dems and the Conservatives will try to blame each other for what's gone wrong.

'Only by voting Labour can Eastleigh people reject a Conservative-Liberal Democrat Government that cuts taxes for millionaires and doesn't understand how tough life is for local people.'
