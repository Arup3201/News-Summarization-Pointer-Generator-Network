Google is developing a reputation for ‘accidentally’ leaking images of its upcoming devices, and it appears to have done it again with what’s rumoured to be a new 8-inch tablet.

Dubbed 'Nexus 8' by speculators, the tablet is shown in a promotional image on the firm’s Android Apps and Entertainment page and if the rumours are true, would make the tablet just 0.1 inches smaller than the iPad mini.

It appears to be running Google’s latest Android 4.4 KitKat operating system and is a slightly different shape than the current 7-inch, Nexus 7.

The shots of the so-called Nexus 8, pictured, are shown on Google's Android Apps and Entertainment page. It has a different shape and smaller bezels than the search giant's current Nexus 7 device. An 8-inch tablet would more closely compete with Apple's 7.9-inch iPad mini

Google has a series of mysterious containers docked off the coast of San Francisco.

One rumour claimed it was a research centre, while another said it was a showroom for Google products.

A MailOnline investigation recently uncovered a second structure being built hastily at the top secret site.

The huge structure is made up of shipping containers and looks set to be identical to the first.

Another identical barge has been spotted on the East Coast in Portland, Maine.

Such is the level of secrecy surrounding the project even members of the Coast Guard have been forced to sign non-disclosure agreements along with the teams of engineers and welders who have been working there.

If Google is working on an 8-inch tablet it will compete more closely with the iPad mini which deliberately has a 7.9-inch screen designed to distinguish it from other smaller tablets on the market.

Google announced its Nexus 5 handset last week with few surprising features. This was because images of the phone were leaked during a promotional video for Android KitKat back in September.

The phone’s specifications were then leaked in an online manual, and the device later appeared on Google’s official Play Store alongside the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 tablets all before the device was even officially unveiled.

Rumours about a Nexus 8 emerged at the start of the year but died down after the firm released its Google Nexus 7 by Asus tablet in July.

The picture of the so-called Nexus 8 on 
the Apps and Entertainment page can’t be the latest Nexus 7 device 
because it appears to have a slightly different shape. 

Rumours about a Nexus 8 emerged at the start of the year but died down after the firm released its Google Nexus 7 by Asus tablet in July, pictured. The bezels at the bottom of the leaked device are smaller than on the current Nexus 7. The Nexus 8 is also shown running Google's latest Android 4.4 KitKat operating system

It also has fewer bezels at the top and bottom of the device. These are the areas of the tablet where owners can comfortably hold the tablet without touching or interfering with the screen.

The bottom bezel on the Nexus 7, for example, is much thicker than on the leaked images of the rumoured 8-inch model. 

The image was first spotted by a member called Britoid on The Verge Forums.

Google doesn’t manufacture its devices; the phones are made by LG and the latest tablets have been made by Asus.

Similarities with the Nexus 8 to the LG G Pad 8.3 tablet could suggest Google will ditch Asus and work with LG on its tablets, too.

Google announced its Nexus 5 handset, pictured, last week after months of leaked images and specifications. It was the first device to run the new Android 4.4 KitKat operating system. The 4G-ready handset starts at £299 for 16GB or £339 for 32GB

The Nexus 7 by Asus, released in 
July, has a seven-inch, 1980x1200 display, which at the time was the 
world's highest resolution screen.

It has a 5MP rear-facing camera 
for the first time, and a faster 1.5Ghz processor compared to the 
first-generation Nexus 7 device.

Google's Nexus 8 is expected to be an upgraded version of the Nexus 7 but no other specifications have been announced.
