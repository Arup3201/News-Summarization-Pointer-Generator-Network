Arsenal forward Theo Walcott has returned to full training, and has an outside chance of making his comeback against Liverpool on Sunday.

The Arsenal forward made just two brief substitute appearances after recovering from a nine month lay-off due to a serious knee injury before sustaining the groin problem that has kept him on the sidelines for over a month.

But the England international trained with the first-team on Thursday and manager Arsene Wenger is considering naming Walcott in the squad that travels to Anfield this weekend.

Walcott's return provides the Gunners' injury-hit squad with a major boost going into the hectic festive period.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain didn't train with the first team on Wednesday, but his omission is viewed as a precaution with the attacking midfielder expected to be passed fit for the clash against Liverpool after recovering from a groin injury sustained in Saturday's win over Newcastle.

Likewise, Nacho Monreal has a chance of being available for the clash against Brendan Rodgers' side after recovering from an ankle injury.

Wenger will be without Jack Wilshere (ankle), Mesut Ozil (knee), Aaron Ramsey (hamstring), Mikel Arteta (calf), Laurent Koscielny (achilles) and Tomas Rosicky (thigh) for the trip to Merseyside.
