Lionel Messi has been getting over his World Cup final heartache with a sun-soaked holiday in Italy with his girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo. 

Messi's Argentina side were beaten by Germany earlier this month as Mario Gotze scored the extra-time winner to send the South Americans away empty handed.

The 27-year-old looked to banish the World Cup woe as he and his partner were joined by friends as they relaxed and soaked up the sun on their luxury vessel off the shores of Ponza.

And the couple turned up the heat when they were spotted flashing quite a bit of flesh during their time on the water.

The Barcelona forward proudly put his washboard abs on display as he relaxed on the deck in just a pair of little white swimming shorts.

And, not to be outdone, his girlfriend Antonella inadvertently gave a full view of her shapely derriere when a gust of sea breeze blew her patterned kaftan up.

Thankfully for the brunette beauty, her dignity was protected by her white bikini, which she wore under her kaftan as she prepared to dine.

Last week, Messi and Antonella were seen sailing around the picturesque island of Capri with their their 20-month-old son Thiago.

They were joined on board the yacht by family members as they made the most of the footballer's free time.

Antonella has stood by her man's side throughout the World Cup, proudly supporting him as he was awarded the Golden Ball for the 2014 tournament's best player.

Yet in spite of his many sporting accolades, Messi insists his biggest achievement in life is his son Thiago.

He previously told Catalan newspaper El Periodico: 'He has changed my life and he is the most important thing.

'In the past, I would get home and continue as if I was still outside and if things were not going well, I would shut myself away. Now I get home, see my son and I get over everything. Thiago has changed me more than all my Balon d'Or.'
