Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said business leaders have a 'patriotic duty' make the case for Brussels

Labour today urged supporters of the European Union to speak out before it is 'too late'.

Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said business leaders have a 'patriotic duty' make the case for Brussels.

And he warned that the Conservative Party's approach to Europe poses 'the biggest risk to British national prosperity in a generation'.

David Cameron has promised that if he remains prime minister after the election he will renegotiate Britain's EU membership before holding an in-out referendum by 2017.

He has made clear that without agreement on curbing benefits, he will 'rule nothing out' – raising the prospect of backing Britain's exit from the EU if he does not get his way.

Today Labour warned business leaders they must start making the arguments against severing ties with Brussels.

In a speech to ambassadors from all 28 EU member states, Mr Alexander said pro-EU business leaders should learn the lessons of the Scottish independence debate.

Many companies delayed expressing a view until the last minute when polls suggest a Yes vote could win, but were then seen as playing a crucial role in shaping the final days of the campaign.

Mr Alexander acknowledged that many business leaders are wary of getting involved in political debates.

But he added: 'For business to speak up for Britain's place in Europe is not about party political advantage, it is about recognising both where our country's national interest and your business interests lies.

'It is about patriotic duty. And good business sense.'

Leaving the EU would mean 'actively choosing an economy with weaker investment, less trade with the rest of the world, poorer productivity and worse living standards,' said Mr Alexander.

He claimed Mr Cameron had become 'a much more marginal figure in Brussels', adding: 'Ukip is on the march, and David Cameron is running.'

Last month the Prime Minister used his long-awaited immigration speech to insist that curbs on tax credits, child benefits, jobseekers allowance and council housing will be a key demand for his talks on renegotiating Britain's EU membership.

Issuing a direct appeal for other European countries who have seen thousands of their citizens move to the UK to support limiting movement across the continent, he insisted his demands were not 'outlandish' and Britain deserves 'to be heard'.

And he threatened to block any new countries joining the EU unless controls are imposed to stop their citizens flocking to more successful economies like Britain.

But Mr Alexander warned that a Conservative victory in the 2015 election would mean that within the course of the next Parliament, Britain could be out of Europe and thrust into a 'full-blown constitutional crisis'.

'The truth is that a Conservative government in 2015 would mean breaking not simply with the record of the last government, it would mean breaking with decades of history that have defined the country we are today, how our country is run, and the place we have in the world,' he said.

'That risk is real. And so too is the responsibility on business to now find its voice and to make the case with authority and passion, that the right road for Britain is not exit from Europe but reform within Europe.'

In a message to the 'quiet majority' of UK business leaders who he said were concerned about EU exit, he added: 'Now is the time to speak out. Now is the time to speak up. Because you know what is most at stake. You know what we have to lose. Your voice must be heard, because if you wait, it could be too late.'

Mr Alexander said that Labour would push for reform of the EU, rather than exit, arguing for the creation of a Council of the Single Market to defend the interests of non-eurozone members and for changes to competition rules to allow national governments to support firms at times of crisis.

Terry Scuoler, chief executive of manufacturers' organisation EEF, said: 'Manufacturers remain overwhelmingly of the view that our economic well-being and long term strategic interest of this country is dependent on being a full and leading player in the EU. Equally we do recognise that reform of the EU is also a key requirement.

'We do not want uncertainty on this subject. Jobs, investment and trade are all dependent on a thriving and effective EU, with Britain at its heart. That's what we all need to be striving to achieve.'

Alisdair McIntosh, director of pro-reform pressure group Business for New Europe, said: 'The debate about our EU membership is about the national interest. Investment, growth and jobs are at stake.

'EU membership is particularly important to vital industries including aerospace, the automotive sector, engineering and pharmaceuticals. It also plays a crucial role in facilitating research and development. These areas are critical for jobs and competitiveness. Politicians and business leaders alike need to reflect this.'
