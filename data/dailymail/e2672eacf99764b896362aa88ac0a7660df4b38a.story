Algerian players observing Ramadan will be exempt from fasting as they prepare to take on Germany in the round of 16 in Porto Alegre tomorrow.

Coach Vahid Halilhodzic says his players will receive a tailored schedule from a travelling imam to ensure they respect the holiest month of the Islam calendar but do not suffer physically.

Muslims fast during daylight hours in the 30 days of Ramadan.

It’s the first time these countries have met since the 1982 World Cup and the infamous ‘Disgrace of Dijon’ when West Germany and Austria conspired to produce a mutually-agreeable 1-0 win for the Germans which eliminated Algeria at the group stage.

The Algerians went out despite having beaten West Germany 2-1.

German striker Lukas Podolski has been ruled out with a leg injury, with Mario Gotze coming in.
