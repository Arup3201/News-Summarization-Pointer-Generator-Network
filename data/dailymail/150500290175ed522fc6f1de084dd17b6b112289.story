AÂ  teacher has had to undergo an emergency operation to save his testicle after he was savaged by an out-of-control dog.

Joel Goodman, 28, was left bleeding in agony on the ground as the dog's owner callously walked away saying: 'I'm not from around here.'

The dog - thought to be an English Bull Terrier - sank it's teeth into Joel's groin during a morning run near his home in Epping, Essex.

Blood-soaked, Joel staggered to a friend's house and was driven to Harlow's Princess Alexandra Hospital where he underwent surgery.

Their journey was slowed by rush-hour traffic but they flagged down a passing police car which then sped them to the hospital.

The operation was a success but Joel has been left with psychological scars from the attack.

He said: 'The dog came out of an alleyway and went straight for me and I did not even have chance to react.

'I did not even see it and it just took a bite.

'The incident was over so quickly but the consequences are going to last for a lot longer.

'Thankfully the doctors were able to save my testicle but I keep re-living the attack and am suffering from anxiety as a result of it.'

Mr Goodman, who teaches singing, is now calling for the dog to be caught and put down before it has a chance to attack another innocent person.

He added: 'It is really hard to talk about this but something has to be done.

'I want the dog put down and the owner prosecuted before it happens to somebody else.'

Police issued a description of the dog's owner following the 9am attack on March 26th.

He was of Eastern European appearance and aged between 35 and 40.

Anyone with information about the incident has been asked to contact Essex Police on 101.
