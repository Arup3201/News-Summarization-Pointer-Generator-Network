Friends of the Sierra Leone sprinter who 'absconded' in the UK for nine months after the Commonwealth Games have urged him to return home after he claimed asylum here.

MailOnline spoke to Jimmy Thoronka's running mates in Freetown, Sierra Leone who said they wanted him back despite the tragedy that has apparently struck his life.

Sandy Musa Aleu, Thoronka's coach at the amateur Freetown Flashpack Runners, said the athlete was the top hope for the sport in his country.

Tragedy: Jimmy Thoronka claims he did not want to return to Sierra Leone after he discovered his adoptive mother, Jelikatu Kargbo, above, had fallen victim to Ebola

Alone: Thoronka was arrested in London last Friday and faces deportation. He has claimed asylum saying there is no one in Sierra Leone to help him - and he wants to become a top athlete here

Taken by Ebola: Jelikatu Kargbo's grave seen from both sides in a cemetery for Ebola victims in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone. Thoronka's adoptive mother is thought to have died from the disease  last year

Lost to a deadly disease: The graveyard where Kargbo was laid to rest. She tragically passed Ebola on to her three sisters and another son, Musa, who all perished from the fever which has ravaged parts of Sierra Leone

He said: 'I think he should come home and be a leader for athletics for our country. Maybe if he apologises to the UK for overstaying his visa, the British government can provide money for his sprinting expenses, his training and his accommodation at events.'

Thoronka, 20, was arrested last Friday when he was found sleeping rough on the streets of London. He disappeared following last year's Glasgow games and failed to return to the Ebola-hit west African country.

He claimed that his flight home was cancelled because of the Ebola crisis and his passport and wallet were stolen - then he was told that his family back home had been wiped out by the deadly virus.

But a top Olympic official in Sierra Leone blasted Thoronka's claims yesterday that he was forced to stay after the Commonwealth Games and accused him of lying to claim asylum in Britain.

Joseph Nyande, the secretary general of the National Olympic Committee, said: 'I spent a week in London and I still flew in. There was no problem with flights, even British Airways was running at that time.

'He absconded. We tried to get on to him, we tried to call him on the telephone. It was embarrassing for us.'

He also cast doubt on Thoronka's claim that his real parents were killed in the 2002 civil war - before he was taken in by an adoptive mother who then died of Ebola.

'I know he has parents here. I don't think there is anything wrong with the parents,' he added. 

Officials in the country's capital Freetown told MailOnline that Jelikatu Kargbo, 56, the nurse in the police service who adopted Thoronka when he was five, along with four other children, after the civil war that ravaged the country, had indeed died last year.

Hometown: Thoronka was raised by his adoptive mother Jelikatu Kargbo in Freetown, where she always encouraged his sprinting. This is the view over the Aberdeen Hill district of the capital city

Kargbo worked at the Kingdom Police Hospital in Freetown, where she caught Ebola from a patient, according to a police source. 

She was admitted to the Rugupta Hospital in the city last summer but not before she passed the virus on to her three sisters and another son, Musa - who all died. 

Sandy Musa Aleu said that Kargbo had brought him up as if he was her own child and encouraged his track and field work with the police athletics team.

He said: 'She was a very kind woman who was always encouraging Jimmy in his sprinting. She came to the track with Musa and Jimmy every week to make sure they did their work.' 

The family lived in a shanty town area called Congo Cross, a teeming and inaccessible slum dominated by gangs and witchdoctors not far from Freetown's national stadium. 

Officials said it was not possible to determine if Thoronka's parents had lived or died in the fighting in the Sierra Leone bush during the country's civil war. 

Many families were torn apart as they fled the maurading militias. Thoronka had not tried to contact his family again.

In recent interviews, Thoronka has expressed his gratitude to his adopted mother and said: 'This lady brought me into her home, she took me as a son and I took her as a mother.' 

Ibrahim Kabia, a fellow runner at Freetown Flashpack runners, said that Thoronka was adored by fans as the country's best 100m and 200m sprinter.

He said: 'People would come to the pitch when he ran for the Sierra Leone Police Athletic Club. His fans shouted "Jimmy!" all the time when ran.

'He became a big star in our country in 2013 when he beat some Australian and Swedish guys in the championships. We were very proud of him.'

Coach Aleu also revealed he last spoke with Thoronka during the competition in Glasgow last year and believes his friend is refusing to return home as he is still devastated because his adoptive mother died.

Support: An online petition appealing to the authorities to let Thoronka remain in the UK has so far attracted more than 70,000 signatures and well wishers have donated more than £28,000 to help the young athlete

Success: Thoronka showed promise as a young athlete and is pictured here receiving the national schools U-17 100 metre gold medal. He said he wants to stay here to achieve his dream, otherwise 'he'd kill himself'

He said: 'I tried to keep the news that his mother had died from him while he was in Glasgow but some of his friends had already told him.

'He called me and asked about his relatives. I said they were fine but he did not believe me. 

'I wanted him to focus on the competition because he is first class. He had overcome so much and this was devastating for him. Now I am still worried about him.' 

Thoronka himself admitted he was confused after Mr Nyande publicaly undermined his story as another Olympic offiicial, Abdul Karim Sesay, spoke out in his defence and claimed Mr Nyande's attack was politically motivated.

Thoronka told the Guardian: 'Two National Olympics Committee people are telling me two different things.

'If it can be proved that my adopted mother Jelikatu Kargbo is still alive and can continue to support me that will be very good. 

'I would be very happy to speak with her again but I have been told that she is dead and I have no family left.

'If I go home, I will have no one to help me. If they can find my adopted mother and bring her to me, I will be very happy but I think some people are trying to destroy me.'

Thoronka's friends hit back at Mr Nyande's statement and coach Aleu claimed that the association was trying to hide its own embarrassment at not providing the sprinter with the support he needed.

He said: 'I had to nurse Jimmy myself when he had malaria last year. The Olympic association offered him nothing. He went to Glasgow fit and well because of me.' 

Thoronka was arrested on Friday and quizzed by officers over whether he was carrying or using drugs, which he denied. He has since been released. 

He is living in Home Office accommodation near Heathrow Airport and has been inundated with offers of help and requests for media interviews.

He told the Guardian: 'I want to stay here. Nobody [would] look after me. No one persecuted me, my problem is I don’t have a family there. The person that would help me has passed [due to] Ebola. If I go back, I would not be able to make it, or I would kill myself because I would not proceed with my dream.'

Asylum: Thoronka has been released by the Home Office and is living near Heathrow Airport for now 

An online petition appealing to the authorities to let Thoronka remain in the UK has so far attracted nearly 70,000 signatures and well wishers have donated more than £28,000 to help the young athlete.

Experts have said it would be safe for Thoronka to return to the country. 

Tom Dannatt, CEO of Street Child UK, the most active charity working with Ebola orphans across the region, said: 'Freetown is a safe area to travel to as long as people are properly educated about the risks and prevention methods to stop them contracting the virus. 

'Education is the silver bullet to this crisis, which is why Street Child has trained over 1,200 Ebola educators in Sierra Leone to spread the word about Ebola prevention.

'If Jimmy washes his hands regularly using chlorine, avoids touching sick people and does not attend traditional funerals I have no doubt he will be safe. 

'All Street Child staff across the country have been given this exact advice and not one of them has contracted the virus, even though they have been going into high risk areas to provide support for orphans in desperate need.'
