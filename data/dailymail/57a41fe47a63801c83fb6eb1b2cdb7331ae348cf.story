Poundland has teamed up with builder Tommy Walsh, pictured, to launch a range of DIY essentials 

Poundland is making a new assault on Middle Briton by moving from Jane Asher cupcake tins to hammers and nails.

The budget chain has signed a partnership with TV building expert Tommy Walsh to launch a DIY range with all items costing just £1.

The company is keen to challenge the DIY warehouses like Homebase and B&Q which have been forced to announce the closure of some outlets amid changing lifestyles and shopping habits.

The DIY specialists claim the closures reflect the fact that people don’t have the skills, time or interest in doing their own house maintenance and make-overs.

However, Poundland believes there is a need for some DIY essentials in the high street, where there are relatively few specialist stores offering these products.

Ironically, decorating products, nuts and bolts used to be sold by Woolworths before the chain went bust, leaving empty stores which have subsequently been taken over by Poundland.

At one time, the chain was shunned by middle and upper income families who fought to keep the stores out of their high streets, however the pound stores are now at the heart of many communities.

Poundland has won new customers with baking equipment under the brand of celebrity cake maker Jane Asher, while a new range of beauty products, such as lipstick and mascara, was praised in the fashion press.

Now it is making an assault on the DIY market with a range of essential tools and packs of screws and nails for £1 each.

A spokesman said: ‘The 200-strong ‘DIY:Time’ range, which includes decoration and preparation essentials as well as tools, fixtures, fittings and adhesives. It will be aimed at anyone, novice or professional, looking to complete everyday DIY projects.’

It will not reveal the specific products until the range is launched into stores in March.

Tommy Walsh, who is best known for his work on the BBC series Ground Force, said: ‘I’m a great believer in value for money. I was raised with the view that if you look after the pennies, the pounds will look after themselves.

‘I’ve been working with Poundland for over a year now, developing and testing the ‘DIY: Time’ range to produce good quality products at the lowest possible price of just £1. It is a great opportunity to make DIY more affordable to everyone.’

Poundland chief executive, Jim McCarthy, said: ‘We are delighted that someone with Tommy’s expertise and reputation in the DIY sector has chosen to work with us to create this high quality affordable range.’
