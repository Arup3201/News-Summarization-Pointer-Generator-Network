The daughter of singer Chrissie Hynde was arrested at anti-fracking protests yesterday as ministers warned the South could become ‘the second biggest area of shale in Britain’.

Environmental activist Natalie Hynde, 30, had ‘superglued’ herself to the entrance of a rural drilling site earmarked for potential fracking in West Sussex.

The site in Balcombe has become a focal point for communities concerned about the process. But yesterday Energy Minister Michael Fallon said that ‘towns, villages and countryside’ could all be targeted for drilling if gas were discovered, no matter their location or beauty.

Determined: Natalie Hynde superglued herself to Simon 'Sitting Bull' Medhurst to create a 'human lock' by the gate to the proposed drilling entrance

Removed: Ms Hynde and her partner Mr Medhurst were arrested following the stunt at a protest against fracking planned for a site in Balcombe, West Sussex

So far, 25 protesters have been held by police in Balcombe. Arrested alongside Miss Hynde – the daughter of the Kinks’ Ray Davies and the Pretenders’ frontwoman –  was her boyfriend, veteran eco-warrior Simon ‘Sitting Bull’ Medhurst, 55.

They had glued their hands together in a ‘human lock’ by the gate to the proposed drilling entrance at around 8.30am. A row of police officers acted as a human shield to hold back protesters while negotiating with the pair for over two hours. The couple were eventually freed by officers using glue thinner.

The couple had set up camp opposite the main entrance to the gate, and had been staying in a small blue tent since the start of the protest a week ago.

One activist said their decision to glue themselves together had been made on impulse. He said: ‘For a moment there was no police officer at the gate and they took the opportunity to jump in there and glue themselves together.’

Rock star: Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders

Activism: The daughter of two chart-toppers, Ms Hynde's own passion appears to lie in environmental activism

Controversy: The protest has been ongoing at the village in West Sussex for the past week

The campaign comes as officers warned such protests are putting a strain on police resources and forcing them to delay other operations.

Fracking involves pumping liquid at high pressure deep underground to split shale rock and release gas for use as fuel. Mr Fallon warned the village would not be the only site in the South that could see drilling, if the country is to benefit from a gas bonanza.

In response to comments by Tory peer Lord Howell – father-in-law of Chancellor George Osborne – that fracking should be concentrated in the ‘desolate’ North East of England, the minister said: ‘It cannot be right to confine it to areas of the industrial North.

Furore: Police worked to free the pair at the protest site, where large teams of officers have been deployed for the past week

Anger: Protestors have been gathered at the site for a week to protest against Cuadrilla's exploratory drilling activities

Strength of feeling: The anti-fracking activists staged a fake 'death' at the rural spot in West Sussex today

Shale exists under towns, villages 
and countryside. Shale gas is everywhere and could well be in quantity 
under attractive areas of the country as well as industrial areas.’

He added the South could become ‘the 
second biggest area of shale in Britain’ and communities could benefit 
financially as a result.

In June, a British Geological Survey claimed there may be more than 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas under the North of England alone.

Industry experts claim even if 10 per cent is recovered – more than all of the gas produced from the North Sea – it will be enough to power Britain for 50 years.Now a similar study is being carried out in the South, with results expected next spring.

‘The same survey is now being done of the southern base, roughly from Dorset through Hampshire, Sussex, Surrey and Kent,’ Mr Fallon said.

‘We will know in March whether there is much more there than was originally thought.’

Balcombe, which has been selected for exploratory drilling by fracking company Cuadrilla, has attracted a growing number of protesters attempting to block equipment from being taken on site.

Despite this, the firm’s boss predicted drilling could begin as soon as today.

Although he said he had ‘no intention of ruining the countryside’, he side-stepped questions about whether fracking would take place close to people’s homes, adding ‘we would have to do it in a regulated fashion’.

Campaigners who have turned up to the West Sussex site include Bianca Jagger and former Page 3 model Marina Pepper.

Miss Hynde and Mr Medhurst were still in custody last night.
