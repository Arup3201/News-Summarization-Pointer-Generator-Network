Several Tory MPs are planning to run on ‘joint tickets’ with the UK Independence Party at the next general election, it emerged last night.

A handful of MPs were said to be considering a ‘Unite the Right’ campaign to prevent Labour capitalising on a split vote following a surge in support for Nigel Farage’s party.

The sitting Tory MP would stand as a Tory-Ukip candidate. In return for its support, Ukip would expect to be able to influence Conservative Party policy.

Banned: UKIP leader Nigel Farage to due to appear at three events at the Tory party conference, but has been erased from the official guide

Nadine Dorries MP was the first to 
float the idea earlier this year, saying she would be ‘having that kind 
of conversation’ with activists in her constituency and that many 
Conservatives have ‘huge empathy’ with Ukip.

Eight
Tory-held seats are said to be at high risk of being lost because of 
Ukip splitting the traditional Tory vote and letting in either Labour or
the Lib Dems.

The proposal
comes as the latest YouGov poll shows that Labour has surged ahead, 
mainly at the expense of the Conservatives who are losing voters to 
Ukip. The poll puts Labour on 42 per cent, the Tories on 31 per cent, 
Ukip on 13 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 9 per cent.

Rejection: Foreign Secretary William Hague ruled out the idea of a pact with UKIP to prevent the loss of Tory votes

David Cameron pledged yesterday to remove all commitments to ‘ever-closer union’ from EU treaties.

In a hardening of his stance, the Prime Minister said he wanted to go as far as erasing the EU’s original mission statement, which commits nations to closer integration.

He said: ‘Others can sign up to an ever-closer union, but Britain should not. I’m determined to make sure we get out of that.’

Speaking at the Tory Party conference, Foreign Secretary William Hague also told delegates that more countries were coming round to Britain’s view that powers should be returned to individual countries.

Miss
Dorries said yesterday: ‘I know other MPs in marginal constituencies 
are in talks about entering into agreements. It’s going to be very 
difficult in the general election when you’ve got two candidates 
espousing the same sort of values.

‘We’ll
have a Conservative candidate calling for a referendum, being strong on
crime, immigration and grammar schools, and the Ukip candidate saying 
much the same sort of things. So there’s a case for running on a joint 
ticket.’

Conservative 
Central Office yesterday stamped on the claims, saying joint tickets 
would not be allowed and any MP who tried would not have their 
nomination papers signed.

But
it comes as a hard-hitting report out yesterday by The Bow Group, a 
Right-wing think tank, warned that Tory Party membership is ‘dying’ and 
could be overtaken by Ukip in just five years’ time.

Among
its recommendations to reverse the trend are a pact with Ukip, 
initiatives to attract younger members online, and for candidates to be 
selected without interference from the party’s central command.

Yesterday, a Cabinet minister said that core Tory voters ‘must be made aware that if they vote Ukip they could get Miliband’.

And
Mark Garnier, Tory MP for Wyre Forest, a marginal seat which could be 
lost to Ukip, said: ‘The right thing for an honest politician to do is 
stand on a manifesto he or she truly believes in. The wrong thing to do 
is run scared and sign up to a set of someone else’s beliefs just for 
personal, short-term electoral gain.’

Banned: David Cameron has revealed women could be prohibited from wearing Muslim veils in courts

The Muslim veil could be banned in courts, schools and immigration centres, David Cameron signalled yesterday.

The Prime Minister said he was ‘happy’ to look at whether the Government should issue national guidelines to limit the use of full-face veils.

He insisted there was no question of legislation to prevent Muslim women wearing the niqab veil completely, but voiced strong support for the right of judges, juries, teachers and immigration officers who demand that they are removed.

Mr Cameron also suggested patients being treated in hospitals should have a right to see the face of any doctor or nurse treating them.

The Prime Minister told the BBC’s Andrew Marr: ‘We are a free country and people should be free to wear whatever clothes they like in public or in private. But we should support those institutions that need to put in place rules so that those institutions can work properly.

‘So for instance in a school, if they want that particular dress code, I believe the Government should back them. The same for courts, the same for immigration.

‘We should back those institutions that want to have sensible policies that actually have a particular purpose.’

Earlier this month a judge in London ordered a Muslim defendant to remove her veil to give evidence.

Judge Peter Murphy said it was crucial for the jury to see the woman’s face so they could assess her demeanour and expression.

But, in a case that made legal history, he said she could retain the veil for all other parts of her trial. And he asked politicians for clearer instructions on veils in court.

Asked if he would support calls for national guidelines on the wearing of the niqab in court, Mr

Cameron said: ‘I’m very happy to look at that.

‘Obviously, in court the jury needs to be able to look at someone’s face. I’ve sat on a jury, that’s part of what you do.

‘When someone is coming into the country, an immigration officer needs to see someone’s face.

‘In a school, it’s very difficult to teach unless you can look your pupils in the eye.’

The issue of veils in schools erupted earlier this month when students, staff and visitors to

Birmingham Metropolitan College were told they must have their faces visible at all times so they are ‘easily identifiable’.

Following an outcry, the college reversed the decision.
