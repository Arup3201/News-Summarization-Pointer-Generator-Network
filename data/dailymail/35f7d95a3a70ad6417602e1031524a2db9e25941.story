South Korea coach Hong Myung-bo has ordered QPR to release defender Yun Suk-young for his country’s pre-World Cup camp.

Rangers will play Derby County on May 24 at Wembley for a place in the Premier League and have yet to release him.

FIFA rules mean South Korea can stop Yun playing in the Championship play-off clash as May 19-25 has been designated as an ‘official rest period’ for all players selected for the tournament in Brazil, apart from the Champions League final.

Seventeen of Hong’s 23-man squad play abroad and he said: ‘If Yun 
reports to the camp late, then it could set a bad precedent.

'There’s no 
shift to our stance that Yun must be here at the earliest date 
possible.’

QPR have been granted permission by Croatia to play Niko Kranjcar and haven't given up hope that Yun could still be given the green light.

The 24-year-old has featured 11 times since his arrival at Loftus Road in January 2013, but has played a part in the past three games.
