In glorious sunshine and attention focused during political speeches, these youngsters are pictured on a summer camp the day before the murderous rampage on Utoya island.

Smiling as they enjoyed the annual camp, it is not known how many of the politically-motivated youngsters in this picture were killed when gunman Anders Breivik embarked on his 90-minute murder spree.

For more than 20 years, members of the Norwegian Labour Party's youth group the AUF have descended on Utoya island for the annual camp, which features partying, music and debates.

Sharidyn Svebakk-Bohn, above, was shot dead on Utoya Island during the 90-minute killing spree carried out by Anders Breivik.

She is among 33 confirmed to have died in the twin bomb and shooting attacks in Norway on Friday. That still leaves 43 unaccounted for, with police looking for bodies in the lake surrounding the island.

Those killed include:Trond Bernsten; Syvert Knudsen; Havard Vederhus; Simon Saebo; Aleksander Aas Eriksen; Maianne Sandvik; Ismail Haji Ahmed; Tarald Mjelde; Johannes Buo; Gunnar Linakar; Emil Okkenhaug; Chrisopher Perreau; Snorre Haller;Â  Tore Eikeland; Torjus Blattman; Andrine Bakkene Espeland; Anders Kristiansen; Guro Havoll; Sverre Bjorkavag; Tove Ashill Knutsen; Hanna M. Orvik Endresen; Kai Hauge; Silje Merete Fjellbu; Hanne A. Balch Fjalestad; Bano Abobakar Rashid; Diderik Aamodt Olsen; Simon Saebo; Synne Royneland; Anne Lise Holter; Birgitte Smetbak; Margrethe Boeyum Kloven; Even Flugstad Malmedal; Tamta Liparteliani

The pictures were taken by the country's Foreign Minister, Jonas Gahr Stoere, just 24 hours before the mass shooting.

It
 comes as dramatic details emerged of the moment police finally arrested
 Breivik after he had gunned down 68 people on the island and killed 
another eight with a fertiliser bomb in Oslo.

Officers
 revealed they came within seconds of shooting Breivik as they stormed 
on to the island as they believed he might be strapped with explosives.

Senior police officer Haavard Gaasbakk said: 'We could see that shots were being fired on the southern tip of the island.

'We could see ammunition hit the water, and we heard the cracks.

'We come to a forested area and the suspect stands there right in front of us with his hands high above his head.

'The
 situation was very tense, and they couldn't see - the way he was 
clothed, they worried he could have had a suicide bomber's vest.'

Breivik's gun, a semi-automatic rifle
 he appeared to have modified to make it automatic, was found on the 
ground 50ft behind him.

An armed police team was forced to 
commandeer private speed boats after their vessel developed engine 
problems on the way to the island.

As they arrived, frantic youngsters pointed to where Breivik was still firing and the officers ran to arrest him.

More than 600 people were evacuated from the island and officers set up an emergency treatment centre for the wounded.

Details of the terrifying 90-minute shooting spree have also emerged, with Breivik crossing the island as he chased victims.

The 32-year-old got off a ferry armed with his rifle, a pistol and carrying ammunition in a bag at 5.07pm on Friday.

Thirty seconds later he shot dead Monica Busei, 45, and off-duty policeman Trond Berntsen, 51, near houses on the island.

He
 then calls a group of youngsters together at a cafe, claiming he has 
important news on the Oslo bombing, before executing them.

At
 5.15pm, Breivik stalks through the island camp site shooting youths as 
they try to run away, before reaching a track called Love Path where he 
kills the majority of his victims.

Police
 are alerted at 5.33pm, as Breivik shoots people who have jumped into 
the lake or climbed trees in a desperate bid to get away.

Armed police arrive at the island at 6.26pm, when Breivik drops his weapon and surrenders.

Plot: Police at Breivik's farm, where he made a fertiliser bomb which he detonated in the government district in Oslo, killing eight

Destruction: This image showing the crater was taken minutes after the bomb blast in Oslo

Norwegian police said today they will interrogate Breivik again tomorrow over the bombing and shooting.

Police lawyer Paal-Fredrik Hjort Kraby told a news conference they will question him for the second time, but did not indicate what they will ask him.

Breivik was first questioned for seven hours on the day after the attack.

He has confessed to the attacks, claiming he was trying to save the Western world from Muslim colonisation, but denies responsibility for the killing.

His lawyer said he considers himself a 'saviour' and is likely insanse.

Last night Norwegian police officially identified more of the people killed in both attacks.

Parents of foreign students who were at the camp have also travelled to the Scandinavian country in the hope their children survived.

The body of a young Georgian woman has been identified this morning.

Tamta Liparteliani, a university graduate and Young Socialists activist, was found at the bottom of the lake with gunshot wounds to her back. She was identified by her fingerprints.

A Romanian woman whose daughter was also on the island said she had called and texted her 'hundreds of times' since the attack, but now believes she is dead.

Anca Holst said 15-year-old Karin Elena Holst phoned her to say a man was 'shooting everyone'.

The petrified girl did not want to hang up, but her mother urged her to stop talking and hide, she told Romanian TV.

But she has not heard from her since. 'I think my child is dead,' she said.

Before launching his attacks, which killed a total of 76 people, Breivik wrote of his allegiance to the Knights Templar - which he described as a secret society created to carry out a crusade against Islam in Europe.

Victims: Bano Abobakar Rashid, 18, and Margrethe Boeyum Kloeven, 16, were both shot dead on Utoya island

Gunned down: Diderik Aamodt Olsen, 19, and Hanne Fjalestad, 43, were also killed during the 90-minute shooting rampage across the island

A British man called Paul Ray, who writes an anti-Muslim blog called 'Lionheart', has claimed the group does exist and he was one of its founders.

But he denied any contact with Breivik and denied he was the Norwegian's mentor.

In his manifesto, Breivik claimed the group was created at a meeting in London in 2002 and he was mentored by a man called 'Richard (the Lionhearted)'.

The medieval Knights Templar was a Christian military order founded in the early 12th century whose members, wearing white mantles with a red cross, became one of the most formidable fighting forces of the Crusades. It was dissolved in 1312.

Cut off: Breivik, 32, is being held at Ila prison, a former Nazi concentration camp, where is not allowed access to TV, newspapers, radio or mail

Anders Breivik is being held at Ila 
prison, a former Nazi concentration camp, but could be moved to another 
maximum security jail.

One possible facility overlooks the Tyrifjorden waters and is close to Utoya Island where he launched his attack.

Last night, the killer was being kept in isolation and was on 'suicide watch'.

A
 full evaluation of his mental state is likely to take up to three 
months, but prison sources have said he may not wish to cooperate or 
answer questions.

Ila
 was originally a women's prison called Grini before the German invasion
 of Norway during World War Two saw it become a concentration camp run 
by the Gestapo from 1940.

Detainees
 included a raft of Norwegian political prisoners and the camp was 
enlarged as more people arrived, before being shipped to Dachau or 
Auschwitz.

In 1942 five
 members of the First Airborne Division were captured after their glider
 crashed in bad weather on a failed 'Operation Freshman' mission to bomb
 a chemical plant.

The 
British survivors were taken to Grini and later - on the express orders 
of Adolf Hitler - they were marched into nearby woods, blindfolded and 
shot one after another in the back of the head.

Breivik has been banned from receiving post, reading newspapers, watching TV or listening to the radio.

He is only allowed to see a priest, doctors or his lawyer.

In
 his manifesto, Breivik pledged to escape from any prison holding him 
and said he had formulated a 'second bonus mission' which would see him 
assassinate 'up to five traitors' once he had escaped.

He claimed he had intelligence on his later targets so he could carry out his operation 'in a timely and professional manner'.

His plan said he had already buried weapons and equipment near to the prisons he was most likely to be held at.

He would then hijack a vehicle from a civilian and 'initiate' his mission.
