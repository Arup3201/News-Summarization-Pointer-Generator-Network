A farmer who has constructed a rather suggestive hay bale structure, which is fully exposed out the front of his property, could face pornographic charges.

The sculpture, made out of bales of compressed grass, depicts the obscene intimacy between a cow and a bull.

Bruce Cook, who owns Kaktus Point Charolais stud at Lake Charm in northwest Victoria, told Daily Mail Australia that police told him to pull down the model after they received a complaint about the offensive nature of the statue.

Bruce Cook has been warned by police that he may face serious charges if he doesn't take down his 'offensive' hay bale structure out in front of his property at Lake Charm, northwest of Victoria

Mr Cook put up his 'realistic' artwork on Good Friday just for 'a bit of fun'.  He says many passersby have enjoyed his sculpture and even stopped to take photos

But he has refused to do so and further 'told the copper to p*ss off' despite police warning that Mr Cook could be charged with 'publishing pornographic images', the NT News reports.

Mr Cook, also known as 'Cooky', described his artwork as 'a bit of fun' which he put up on Good Friday.

He says many passersby have enjoyed his sculpture and even stopped to take photos.

The 59-year-old owns the property out at Lake Charm and isn't too fazed by the complaints about his sculpture

'It's just a realistic piece of artwork so I really don't know what the fuss is about,' the farmer said

'On Saturday morning, I saw about 10 cars parked out the front because they stopped to take photos of the art,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'The cop called me and told me they received a complaint about the sculpture because it was indecent. He told me that I could face serious charges if I don't take it down.

'But I told the copper to p*ss off. I'm not going to take it down unless I receive a court order.'

 Mr Cook says he will be adding fairy lights to the structure tonight and plans to add an extra two calves to complete the sculpture

 Acting Sergeant Chris O'Flaherty, duty officer of the local Kerang Police Station, was unable to provide details of the matter but did confirm that police spoke with Mr Cook on Wednesday

Although the 59-year-old isn't fazed by the complaints about his structure, he doesn't quite understand why anyone would find it insulting.

'It's just a realistic piece of artwork so I really don't know what the fuss is about,' he said.

'People offended by it must have a dirty mind or are just prudish.' 

The 59-year-old farmer said 'people offended by it must have a dirty mind or are just prudish'

And just to add a bit of cheek, Mr Cook says he will be adding fairy lights to the structure tonight and plans to add an extra two calves to complete the sculpture. 

Acting Sergeant Chris O'Flaherty, duty officer of the local Kerang Police Station, was unable to provide details of the matter but did confirm that police spoke with Mr Cook on Wednesday.

He told Daily Mail Australia no charges have been made and the matter is still under investigation.
