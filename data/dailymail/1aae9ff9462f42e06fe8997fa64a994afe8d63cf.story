The U.S. death toll from fungal meningitis linked to potentially contaminated steroid injections has risen by two to 23, with North Carolina reporting its first death.

Tennessee's death total in the outbreak rose to eight, the highest state total, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.

States reported 13 new cases of fungal meningitis, raising the total to 281. There are also three peripheral infections caused by injections into joints.

Deadly injections: The U.S. death toll from fungal meningitis linked to potentially contaminated steroid injections has risen by two to 23, with North Carolina reporting its first death

Raided: The Food and Drug Administration search the NECC pharmacy in Framingham last week after at least 50 vials of steroids containing fungi linked to meningitis were discovered

The outbreak stems from medications 
shipped by the New England Compounding Center (NECC) in Massachusetts. 
The company faces federal and state investigations and lawsuits over the
tainted medications.

Indiana
and New Hampshire reported two new cases apiece, while Virginia, 
Tennessee and New Jersey each had three new cases, the CDC said.

Health
regulators last week confirmed the presence of the deadly Exserohilum 
fungus in vials of the NECC steroid used for pain injections.

They estimate that as many as 14,000 people may have been exposed to the contaminated medication.

NECC
and its executives face a civil suit in Massachusetts that seeks to 
freeze the officers' personal assets. Florida, which has had three 
deaths and 17 cases, has barred NECC from doing business in the state.

Last Monday, the federal Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) said it had widened its investigation to other 
drugs produced by NECC, fearing all of their products' sterility, following a raid on its Massachusetts phramacy.

NECC has shipped more than 17,000 vials part of three suspected lots of the drug to clinics in 24 states.

Investigation: The pharmaceutical company's Massachusetts headquarters were cordoned off

Confirmed: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said they have found Exserohilum, a type of fungi, in patients with meningitis

The Massachusetts company faces multiple investigations and lawsuits over the tainted medication linked to the meningitis scare.

Experts believe the outbreak will get worse before it gets better.

Dr
William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at the Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center in Nashville, said: ‘We will see more patients
reporting in ill and we'll have to treat many more.’ 

Earlier this month, the FDA said that more than 50 vials of steroid treatments from 
NECC tested positive for a fungus that causes meningitis.

Infections have been detected within two weeks of a patient receiving the NECC-supplied medication methylprednisolone acetate, on average, and up to 42 days afterward.

But anyone exposed to the vials of 
the steroid  - used to treat back pain and other conditions - should be 
vigilant for health problems for several months, CDC officials said.

Back pain: Lilian Cary, 67, from Michigan died of meningitis last month, weeks after being treated with steroids

Grieving: Mrs Cary's husband, George, received similar treatment at the same clinic where his wife was treated but said there was 'no evidence' he had contracted meningitis

Local health authorities have contacted over 90 per cent of patients who 
may have been exposed.

Although
it remains unclear exactly how any medication could have been 
contaminated, federal regulators have come under criticism for failing 
to prevent the outbreak by closely regulating drug compounding companies
such as NECC, which prepare medications for clinics and doctors largely
outside federal oversight.

The FDA has said the law does not give it adequate authority to do so, leaving regulation largely to the states.

The pharmacies are owned by Gregory 
Conigliaro, an engineer, and his brother-in-law Barry Cadden, a 
pharmacist who was in charge of pharmacy operations at NECC.

Besides the meningitis cases, two 
additional patients have a different type of fungal infection from 
injections in their joints (as opposed to back injections).
