Embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford acknowledged ‘rocky moments over the past year’ but vowed to fight harder than ever to win re-election at a rally he dubbed the official launch of his campaign.

Ford, who was the first to register as a candidate in January, invoked the spirit of second chances during a speech in front of supporters on Thursday.

Ford is seeking re-election on Oct. 27 despite acknowledging last year that he had smoked crack cocaine ‘in a drunken stupor.’

Volunteers gave out one free drink to everyone at a hall in a Toronto suburb. There were lineups for Rob Ford bobble-head dolls that were being sold to raise money for the campaign.

The mayor made his way through the crowd along a red carpet to the stage, led by bag-pipers and volunteers carrying campaign signs.

City council removed most of Ford's powers after he admitted to having smoked crack.

‘There's been some rocky moments over the past year. I have experienced how none of us can go through life without making mistakes,’ Ford said.

‘And when they occur, we learn a lot about ourselves. Humility, the kindness of people and the spirit of second chances.’

Aisha Schuster, a supporter, said he's not concerned about Ford's personal life.

‘You know we all have personal stuff. There's no perfect person and I fully support him,’ Schuster said.

George Zambrano also said he's not concerned about Ford's personal life.

‘He's saving us money,’ Zambrano said, adding when asked about the drug admissions: ‘Well you know what, that's his off time. He can do whatever he wants when he's not working.’

Ford is popular among a core of voters in his home suburb of Etobicoke.

His promises to slash spending, cut taxes and end what he called ‘the war on the car’ gained him a loyal following in the suburbs that came to be known as Ford Nation.

The mayor faces a strong challenge for re-election from Olivia Chow, a left-leaning politician popular in liberal downtown Toronto, and from John Tory, a one-time Ontario provincial Progressive Conservative leader.
