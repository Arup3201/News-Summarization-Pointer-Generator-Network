It would not be out of place speeding around famous Formula One circuits like Silverstone or Monaco.

But incredibly, this racing car is not the real thing. Rather than being built in a high-tech garage by a team of expert engineers, it was instead put together in a shed in Brighton by a complete novice.

Kevin Thomas, who has no engineering experience, spent four years piecing together the BAR-Honda replica at his East Sussex home.

A working second-hand version would have set Mr Thomas back around £100,000 - but his cost just £8,000, and hundreds of man hours.

The racing enthusiast hand built his version in a specially designed shed, using parts sourced on eBay and swapped with fellow F1 memorabilia collectors.

Mr Thomas, who created the replica without even using a manual or guide, said: 'A couple of years ago there was a Formula One car on display in a Renault showroom near Brighton.

'I went along to see it and thought to myself '"I would love one of these."'

Soon after his visit, a company called Memento Exclusives listed a former F1 car's chassis on eBay.When it failed to attract a single bid, Mr Thomas speculatively emailed the seller - and was delighted to learn there were two more also up for grabs.

Office-worker Mr Thomas said: 'I did a deal with him there and then. A little while later, he turned up on my doorstep with a Reynard BAR-001 and BAR003 chassis. I paid him cash for the pair.'

He added: 'I haven't just bought things from eBay, though. There's a whole group of memorabilia sites and dealers around the UK, but also you start to build a network of contacts and they know you are looking for a particular types of car parts.

'Then when stuff turns up, they let me know. I get one or two emails a week from people saying, "do you need a new floor?". Things like that.

'Also I check eBay religiously every morning. It's really immaterial what it costs as the people on there do not necessarily realise the value it has to you. They think it's just a worthless old control box from a Honda.'

Despite having no formal training or knowledge of the race car construction industry, Mr Thomas set about handcrafting the replica during his spare time.

He managed to track down every last detail of the car - including authentic suspension systems, wheels, tires, steering wheel and a seat.

Mr Thomas added: 'I slowly started to plan out what I could do with the car, and it quickly became clear that it was very difficult, or even impossible, to get the right parts. I have to use what I can get, from whatever racing car that may be.'

Now, after four years’ hard labour, 
all that is left to complete the replica is an engine - which Mr Thomas 
hopes to locate within the next few years.

He said: 'I have got it to the point now where I can pretty much get it rolling, but you could not drive it.

'The wishbones would probably snap on the first bend.

'In the next year or two, when I can find more of the correct parts, and some spares, I will get it properly rolling.

'The
beauty of having your own Formula 1 car is that you can just build up 
at your own pace, go to tracks you want to go to and do your own thing.'

Mr Thomas hopes to have the car complete soon, but admits he has already started thinking about the next project.
