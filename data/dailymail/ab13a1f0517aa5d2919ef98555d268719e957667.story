Conservative MP Bob Blackman is claimed to have had an 11-year affair with Carol Shaw when they were both councillors

A Tory MP who said that marriage could work only between ‘one man and one woman’ has been accused of hypocrisy – by his alleged former mistress.

Bob Blackman, 58, who made the comments in opposition to gay marriage, is claimed to have had an 11-year affair that started just one year after he married his  wife Nicola.

His alleged former mistress, Carol Shaw, claims that they  had the long-term affair while they were both Conservative councillors.

She said that Mr Blackman is an 
‘absolute hypocrite’ for making the comments about gay marriage last 
month considering his infidelity, which she claims included sex in his 
marital bed  and at an office.

Speaking
about the affair for the first time, Miss Shaw, 62, said: ‘I couldn’t 
believe a man who had an affair with me for over 11 years could have the
cheek to preach about the sanctity of marriage.

‘You
have to be squeaky clean to do that and he has made a mistake. Bob is 
an absolute hypocrite. He talks about marriage being between one man and
one woman ... but why does he not practice what he preaches.

‘More
than once I asked about his wife and I got the impression one day he 
might leave her, because he said he could love two people at the same 
time.’

Mr Blackman last 
month said that he believed marriage had to be ‘between one man and one 
woman’ as he claimed in an interview that David Cameron’s backing of 
religious same-sex marriages was wrong on ‘principle’.

But
Miss Shaw claims that their affair began just a year after he married 
his wife in 1988 when  all three of them were councillors on Brent 
Council in North-West London.

Miss Shaw said that they first had sex
after Mr Blackman dropped her off at her flat after a function, but it 
then became a regular occurrence with frequent Friday afternoon meetings
at her home.

‘Bob was a terrible lover but I was madly in love with him,’ she said in the interview with the Sunday Mirror.

‘He wasn’t one of these 
four-times-a-night lovers. He’d never try anything new. He would just 
say, “I haven’t got much time”. He just wanted to get into it.

Mr Blackman, pictured here with David Cameron, became an MP in 2010 and said marriage could work only between 'one man and one woman'

‘It was once and then he would fall asleep. He would snore and I would have to wake him up.’

Miss Shaw said that the affair ended in 2000 when she became frustrated with the relationship.

She
added: ‘Eleven years is a long time to carry on an affair. It’s not 
like it was a one-night stand. He must have been desperately  miserable 
in his marriage... or  he found me irresistible. I hope it’s the 
latter.’

Miss Shaw, who is still a councillor in Brent, defected to the  Liberal Democrats in 2003.

Mr Blackman was elected MP for Harrow East in 2010.

He lists his wife as his office manager in the Members’ Register of Financial Interests.

Last night Mr Blackman did  not answer the door of his detached home in Wembley, North-West London.
