Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has scored more goals in European competitions than any other player following his brace against Schalke in the last-16 of the Champions League.

Ronaldo struck twice to score his 77th and 78th goals in Europe, which puts him above  former Real Madrid team-mate Raul and Barcelona's Lionel Messi. 

The Portuguese international is also now level with Messi as the joint record all-time goalscorer in the Champions League proper - with 75 goals apiece in Europe's elite competition.

And the 30-year-old did not stop there when it came to breaking records on Tuesday night as he also became the first player in Real's history to score 40 or more goals in five consecutive seasons.

However, the former Manchester United winger did not appear to be too happy after the final whistle despite his side's progression to the quarter-finals of the Champions League.

Ronaldo shook his head in disgust repeatedly and stared into the camera with a frosty glaze following Real Madrid's 4-3 defeat on the night. 

In fact, Ronaldo was so angry that he told reporters: 'I won't talk again until the end of the season.'

Real Madrid fans jeered their side's players throughout the defeat and waved white hankies to show their unhappiness at the performance.

ITV pundit Roy Keane said of the atmosphere at the Santiago Bernabeu: ‘Usually when you qualify for the quarter-finals of the Champions League there is celebration in the stadium but they’re not happy.

'Everybody seemed a little nervous tonight, it was such a strange atmosphere. I’ve been to this stadium a number of times when it’s been bouncing and rocking but from the first whistle everyone just seemed nervous and on edge and it reflected in the team’s performance.

'He (Ronaldo) looked frustrated tonight. His body language wasn’t great. I think he was frustrated with everything with the way he started the game and then with his team-mates because the guy is a winner but obviously he produced the goods.' 

Real boss Carlo Ancelotti openly admitted after the match that his side deserved to be criticised.

‘It was bad for the image of the club,’ said Ancelotti. ‘The reaction of the crowd was totally justifiable but it will serve to wake us up. 

'I still believe in the team because I know what they can give but at the moment they are not giving it. We are playing very badly. We need to train more, work more, we need more of everything.’ 

Meanwhile, Messi will have the chance to close the gap on Ronaldo's European record  when Barcelona host Manchester City at the Nou Camp on March 18.
