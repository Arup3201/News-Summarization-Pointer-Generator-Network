At the end the National Stadium in Brasilia resounded with the sounds of the 20,000 Argentine fans goading their hosts with a chant to the tune of Bad Moon Rising as they waved their shirts above their head.

It is an involved song, explaining how the Brazilians have been crying ever since Claudio Caniggia scored against them in 1990 and how Diego Maradona is better than Pele.

‘How does it feel?’ they sang ‘to be bossed about in your own backyard.’ It has become the anthem of this World Cup, heard everywhere Argentines gather, which is pretty much everywhere.

And it feels particularly appropriate
 at the moment. Argentina have a rag-tag army of fans, sleeping in cars 
and colonising cities and stadia as they journey around this country.

But
 they are led by the World Cup’s last superstar, Leo Messi, and they 
look increasingly as though they are heading for the Maracana next 
Sunday afternoon. Brazil might meet them there, but they are shorn of 
Neymar and an awful realisation is dawning on the hosts: a new nightmare
 of the Maracana might be looming, with Argentina beating them in their 
very own final.

And that would surely be worse than their original nightmare, the Maracanazo, when Uruguay beat them to win the 1950 World Cup

Messi
 undid Belgium with an inspired first-half performance on Saturday, the 
best Argentina have produced so far at this World Cup, with excellent 
supporting roles from Gonzalo Higuain and Lucas Biglia, whose 
introduction brought better balance to the team. On the debit side, they
 may miss Angel Di Maria, who limped off with a thigh injury after 33 
minutes, for the semi final.

It
 was not an overwhelming performance. Belgium, whilst more direct and 
physical than inspirational, never allowed them the comfort of running 
away with the game and right to the end when Romelu Lukaku drove in a 
cross and Axel Witsel shot over, they made it a nervous affair.

Nearly two: Lionel Messi was so close to doubling Argentina's lead with a free-kick in the first half

Painful: Kevin de Bruyne goes down injured in front of Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella

Protection, referee? Lionel Messi pleads for a foul on the ground during the quarter-final

Scuffle: The Italian referee has a word with Kompany over an on-pitch incident

Yet
 Argentina are in their first World Cup semi-final since 1990 and coming
 into form. Principally, one man increasingly looks ready to make this 
World Cup his own.

‘Messi 
played a wonderful match,’ said his coach Alex Sabella.  ‘Every move he 
makes is a sign of hope for us and endangers his opponents, which is 
what he does beyond scoring goals or not.

'The
 influence he has is decisive; the fact that he never loses the ball and
 always brings two or three opponents to him. He is water in the desert.
 He gives us that. Today when the terrain was dry he gave us that breath
 of fresh air.’

Marc 
Wilmots, the Belgium coach, was not in no mood to join any potential 
coronation, however. ‘We were not impressed by the Argentina, absolutely
 not,’ he said.  ‘They’re just an ordinary team. If I had played this 
way I would have been destroyed by Belgian press.’

Unlucky: Higuain nearly doubled his advantage in the second half, but he hit the bar

Stunned: And his coach Sabella fell to the ground after the incident

Celebration: The Argentina fans, who had thousands of supporters in Brazil, cheer with their fans

He
 was right to point out that as the game wore on, Argentina retreated 
and created little, a last-minute chance for Messi aside when Courtois 
saved well. ‘They suffered and if we had equalised they were dead and 
buried,’ said Wilmots. But in reality, Argentina should have had the 
game won by early in the second half.

Wilmots
 did concede that Messi was an ‘extraordinary’ player whilst also 
complaining he was offered too much protection from the referee. In 
truth, it was his first-half performance that decided the fate of this 
game.

There was a moment on
 28 minutes when Messi picked up the ball in his own half and spotted a 
way through a forest of midfielders and managed to cut the ball inside 
Vincent Kompany a full 45 yards away and find Angel Di Maria. As it 
happened, Kompany recovered brilliantly to block the shot but you had to
 pity the Manchester City captain.

The angle accuracy of the pass was simply beyond that you would imagine was possible on a football pitch.

Jubilation: The South Americans fall to the ground after securing the 1-0 victory

Agonising: Kompany had a tough day against Argentina's strikers

Guidance: Messi prays ahead of the crucial game in Brasilia on Saturday

Tough: Marouane Fellaini and Daniel van Buyten try to tackle Higuain

At
 times in that first half Messi seemed almost to be goading the Belgians
 into tackling him, lingering on the ball and turning away at the last 
moment. The match was only eight minutes old when he made his impact, 
turning away from one challenge only to find Marouane Fellaini pressing 
him. Shielding the ball, he simply turned in the opposite direction and 
played in Di Maria.

The 
winger’s cross deflected off a defender and sat up nicely on the half 
volley for Higuain, who has endured a torrent of criticism in his home 
country for his performances thus far. This time though he connected 
beautifully, sweeping it into the far corner from 20 yards out.

But
 Belgium edged their way back into the game. Kevin De Bruyne’s powerful 
strike was parried away by Sergio Romero and Kevin Mirallas headed just 
wide from an excellent Jan Vertonghen cross on 52 minutes Higuain 
unleashed a shot which was deflected wide by Daniel van Buyten while 
Hazard was lucky to stay on the pitch when he raised his studs on to the
 shin of Biglia on 53 minutes.

Argentina
 had a chance to take complete control of the game on 55 minutes. 
Higuain pushed the ball through the legs of Kompany to create a clear 
strike on goal but lifted his shot over Courtois and on to the bar. 
Wilmots brought on Romelu Lukaku for Divock Origi and eventually took of
 the disappointing Hazard, opting to send long balls towards Lukaku, 
Fellaini and Van Buyten.

They
 worried Argentina in their best moments, but the South Americans never 
looked out of control. Finally they are past he quarter finals, a stage 
they could never seem to get beyond. Having done so, perhaps they will 
be freed to deliver the trophy they crave.
