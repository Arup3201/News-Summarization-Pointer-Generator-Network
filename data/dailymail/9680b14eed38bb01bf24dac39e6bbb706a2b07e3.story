It is the only all-European quarter-final of this World Cup and perhaps the most intriguing; two countries with three final appearances between them since 1998.

France are building momentum from an unfancied position, Germany are stuttering a little among plenty of expectation.

Each will play a variation on 4-3-3, with France fielding a more compact midfield and Germany a less-obvious centre-forward. But it will come down to how the players perform.

Here is Sportsmail’s analysis of the probable starting line-ups.

Masters: Germany are looking to reach their fourth consecutive World Cup semi-final

Together: The French squad, who have surprised many, show their team spirit in training

Goalkeeper

Hugo Lloris (Tottenham Hotspur) - Age 27, Caps 61

Captain has performed well and enhanced his reputation in Brazil. Some fine saves coupled with an alertness for danger.

The extinguisher: Lloris has continued his fine form for Tottenham into the World Cup

Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich) - Age 28, Caps 49

Operated more like a sweeper in the extra-time victory over Algeria and dominates his area. Can be rushed on kicks.

Sweeper-keeper: Manuel Neuer let nothing get past him, or in front of him, in the win over Algeria

Verdict: Two goalkeepers magnetically repelled to their own goal-line, Neuer edges it by stature and big-match experience.

Right-back

Mathieu Debuchy (Newcastle United) - Age 28, Caps 24, Goals 2

Arsene Wenger wants him to replace Bacary Sagna at Arsenal. He gets the nod for his nation in any case. Dependable and an attacking threat.

Wanted man: Debuchy is being tracked by Arsenal as a replacement for Frenchman Bacary Sagna

Jerome Boateng (Bayern Munich) - Age 25, Caps 43

Shifted to right-back by Philipp Lahm’s move to midfield, the position is not his best. Perfectly capable and good on the ball but looks odd.

Odd ball: Boateng has had to fill in at right-back, and could be Germany's weak link in Rio

Verdict: Debuchy is playing in his preferred position and will be more comfortable than Boateng.

Left-back

Patrice Evra (Manchester United) - Age 33, Caps 61

Ageing limbs led to criticism at Manchester United but he has blossomed in Brazil, putting in shifts of pace and poise.

Experience: Evra has shown he still has it in the locker in Brazil after some uneasy times at Old Trafford

Benedikt Howedes (Schalke) - Age 26, Caps 25, Goals 2

Flexibility across the back-line gives Germany greater options and as club captain for Schalke offers leadership. Nothing spectacular.

Solid: Benedikt Howedes has justified his selection at left-back during the World Cup

Verdict: Another position where a specialist looks a surer bet, while Evra also brings huge experience.

Centre-back

Mamadou Sakho (Liverpool) - Age 24, Caps 22, Goals 2

The man with the intense eyes and intense style has begun to show why Liverpool paid £18million for him. Athletic if a little erratic.

Rebuilding reputation: Sakho (below) has shown why Liverpool splashed the cash on him last summer

Per Mertesacker (Arsenal) - Age 29, Caps 102, Goals 4

Developed into a favourite at Arsenal and is a composed character on and off field. Towering presence while immobility made up for by anticipation.

Cleared: Mertesacker was on the form of his life last season, and has brought his confidence to Brazil

Verdict: Mertesacker has an ability to organise that Sakho does not – could be key with malleable opposition attacks.

Centre-back

Raphael Varane (Real Madrid) - Age 21, Caps 10

Looks at ease on this stage for a 21-year-old. Silky smooth in possession and a threat from corners. 

Rock: Real Madrid centre-half Varane looks to have experience way beyond his years

Mats Hummels (Borussia Dortmund) - Age 25, Caps 33, Goals 3

Brings blood and thunder from Borussia Dortmund and a high level of technical proficiency.

Towering: Hummels (right) goes up for a challenge with USA's Jermaine Jones in the 1-0 group stage win

Verdict: Real Madrid’s Varane may be young but can become a great. He pips the elder man.

Centre-midfield

Yohan Cabaye (PSG) - Age 28, Caps 33, Goals 3

Has shone for France in deeper role, dictating play from in front of the back four and advancing to unleash trademark shots from range.

Poise: PSG midfielder Cabaye has dropped deeper for France, and the team have benefited

Philipp Lahm (Bayern Munich) - Age 30, Caps 110, Goals 5

The Pep Guardiola experiment continues for the national team. Quite astonishing he can adapt so seamlessly to such a degree.

Next up: Philipp Lahm applauds the fans after their narrow 2-1 win over Algeria

Verdict: A very close call. Lahm is the more established, even if newer to this position, and his wealth of knowledge vital.

Centre-midfield

Blaise Matuidi (PSG) - Age 27, Caps 27, Goals 5

Has enjoyed a real break-out moment this tournament. Gets France ticking at good tempo and performs essential defensive function too.

Surrounded: Matuidi has shone both up and down the pitch during his four appearances

Bastian Schweinsteiger (Bayern Munich) - Age 29, Caps 105, Goals 23

Has seemed short of his best at the World Cup. At his peak a player who can drive on a team through desire and technique.

Midfield man: Germany legend Bastian Schweinsteiger should earn his 106th cap on Friday

Verdict: Matuidi is quietly producing some excellent stuff, in a similar vein to Emmanuel Petit from 1998.

Centre-midfield

Paul Pogba (Juventus) - Age 21, Caps 15, Goals 3

Grows as each match goes by, dominating central areas with strength and finesse. May look like a gazelle but is hard as rhino.

Central man: Pogba put in a magnificent midfield performance against Nigeria

Mesut Ozil (Arsenal) - Age 25, Caps 59, Goals 18

Much like his debut Arsenal season, has sparkled at times and been subdued at others. Can turn a game with a flick of his boot.

Hands aloft: Arsenal man Ozil scores his 18th goal for Germany in the 2-1 win over Algeria on Monday

Verdict: Ozil was once a 21-year-old taking the World Cup by storm, but this is Pogba’s time now.

Right-wing

Mathieu Valbuena (Marseille) - Age 29, Caps 37, Goals 6

The personification of a pocket rocket. Small in stature, big on impact. Provides a nimble outlet from defence to ease pressure and cutting edge too.

Overjoyed: Valbuena (right) looks delighted as the French secured their place in the quarters

Toni Kroos (Bayern Munich) - Age 24, Caps 48, Goals 5

Such an elegant player. Through the middle would be his preferred role but the interchangeable nature of this forward trio means he can influence matters.

Eye on the prize: Kroos is concentrating on his international duty despite heavy rumours of a transfer

Verdict: Valbuena is in his pomp at this World Cup, and for this match looks a key player.

Left-wing

Antoine Griezmann (Real Sociedad) - Age 23, Caps 8, Goals 3

Surname sounds German, developed his football in Spain, but has emerged as the solution to France’s issue on the left. Very gifted.

Winger: Real Sociedad star Griezmann is Les Bleus' answer on the left of midfield

Mario Gotze (Bayern Munich) - Age 22, Caps 33, Goals 10

Has been one of Germany’s best players at this tournament and offers Thomas Muller support on the goal hunt. Agile and intelligent.

Denied: Gotze sees his shot saved by Algeria goalkeeper Rais M'Bolhi during the last 16 game

Verdict: Similar players, both diminutive and excellent on the ball – Gotze edges because of his experience.

Centre-forward

Karim Benzema (Real Madrid) - Age 26, Caps 70, Goals 24

The required spike to France’s attack, has scored goals, created chances and come-of-age at a major international tournament.

Up top: Benzema has three goals and two assists in his four appearances at this World Cup

Thomas Muller (Bayern Munich) - Age 24, Caps 53, Goals 21

Nine World Cup goals in nine matches is some feat for a guy who nobody would recognise as an out-and-out striker. Drifts across the front and will shot on sight.

I'm the man: Thomas Muller has scored four and assisted two goals in his four games so far

Verdict: So different, so difficult to compare. Muller is the ultimate scorer at this event though, so he wins out.

Managers

Didier Deschamps - in charge since 2012

Really impressive in his initial squad selection – omitting Samri Nasri for purposes of unity – and has continued during match. Able to rotate his players and tactics accordingly.

In charge: Low (left) has been in charge for eight years, while Deschamps has seen a huge improvement

Joachim Low - in charge since 2006

A master of this team, overseeing development from promise to fruition. Now the challenge is to adorn his work with a trophy.

Verdict: A tie.

Final score: France 6-5 Germany
