The millionaire boss of French technology giant Dassault Systemes said 'residing in France has become a big handicap.'

Bernard Charles' criticism of President Francois Hollande's new tax regime comes as two senior executives at Moët Hennessy move to London from Paris.

President Hollande is under pressure as Gallic tycoons look to quit France to flee higher taxes while the economy continues to struggle.

Cashing out: Bernard Charles, 55, has revealed he is considering joining thousands of wealthy French fleeing President Francois Hollande's new tax regime

Mr Charles, 55, said he is considering whether to follow suit and leave the country.

He told French daily Le Monde in an interview: 'Residing in France has become a big handicap. Very largely, our hiring of top managers will have to be done elsewhere than in France.'

Europe's richest man Bernard Arnault denies the two executives from Moët Hennessy, the champagne and cognac arm of LVMH, are leaving because of tax reasons.

Mr Arnault, who heads LVMH luxury goods company, told the Financial Times that tax is not behind the move by LVMH director Gilles Hennessy and Christophe Navarre, chief executive of Moët Hennessy. 

Mr Arnault is himself applying for residency in Belgium.

The latest moves will be bad news for President Hollande, whose approval ratings have dropped to as low as 30 per cent as unemployment reached 10 per cent of the workforce.

LVMH said it will continue to be based in Paris and told the Financial Times Belgian national Mr Navarre 'pays, and will continue to pay, his taxes in France.'

The paper reported that Mr Hennessy plans to retire later this year. 

Mr Charles said his own decision about whether to leave France will not be based on tax.

'But to be clear, this isn’t about plans for a 75 per cent tax on all earnings above a million euros - even if I do think that tax above a certain level is confiscatory.'

Mr Charles sold £24million worth of shares in Dassault Systemes - which makes software for industry - last year.

Asked if this was a sign he was about to quit, he answered: 'I had to do that to pay other taxes related to the purchase of other shares, but it does show how heavy taxes are these days.

'But if I find I can no longer buy and sell shares in the company, I will leave.'

He also revealed that other highly-paid Dassault executives had left France, adding: 'I can’t say how many, but not as many as those that want to.'

His concerns of crippling new taxes on the rich come after optician chain tycoon Alain Afflelou - who has an estimated £190million fortune - said last year he was moving to Britain to pay less.

Film star Gerard Depardieu and France’s richest man Bernard Arnault both announced last year they also wanted to move abroad.
