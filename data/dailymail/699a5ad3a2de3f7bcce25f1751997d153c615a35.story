You no longer have to rely on an honest friend to tell you whether your breath smells unpleasant - now there's an app for that.

Breathometer, a San Francisco-based company that previously launched a Bluetooth breathalyzer last year, has created Mint, a new gadget that assesses both the quality and hydration level of your breath.

A small device that's placed in the mouth automatically draws an air sample and, seconds later, the Breathometer smartphone app reveals whether you're minty fresh or breathing fire.

Fresh idea: Breathometer, a San Francisco-based company, has created Mint, a new gadget that assesses both the quality and hydration level of your breath

How it works: A small device is placed in the mouth and automatically draws an air sample

Users receive a 'mint score' between one and five, letting them know whether they're 'good to go' or 'need a mint'.

'Breath quality, it turns out, is something a lot of consumers aren't aware of,' Breathometer CEO Charles Yim told Yahoo.

'It is very indicative of your overall body health. It helps you see the earlier signs in your oral cavity first. So when we say breath quality, it’s more than just bad breath.'

Mint detects odor by measuring the volatile sulfur compounds in your mouth, which the company says can also indicate gum disease or tooth decay.

The gadget also measures the moisture level of your mouth's mucus membrane and lets you know whether you need a glass of water.

Breathometer is currently seeking support for the invention via the crowd-funding site Indiegogo, where it has already raised $26,420, exceeding its goal of $25,000.

The company expects to begin shipping the device in August 2015.

Mr Yim previously launched the Alcohol Breathometer on Indiegogo in March 2013, and appeared on Shark Tank later that year, persuading all five Sharks to invest $1 million combined in the creation.
