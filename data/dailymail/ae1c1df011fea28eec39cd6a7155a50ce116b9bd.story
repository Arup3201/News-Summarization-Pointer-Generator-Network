It has been a year since 79 passengers were killed in a tragic train crash in Spain.

To pay tribute to those who lost their lives, the country’s King and Queen have made a royal pilgrimage to the city’s cathedral.

Queen Letizia and King Felipe, who succeeded the throne in June, visited the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela yesterday to mark the anniversary.

The couple were invited to attend the traditional ceremony of tribute to the Apostle Santiago or St James, whose tomb is within the cathedral.

The building is thought of as one of the most important shrines in Christendom and is visited by pilgrims from all over the world.

Don Julián Barrio Barrio, the Archbishop of the Cathedral, greeted the pair as well as several visitors who had come out to catch a glimpse of the royal couple and pay tribute to those killed.

They watched the swinging 'Botafumeiro', the biggest censer in the world, as incense is burned inside the metal container.

It is normally on exhibition in the cathedral library but during important religious ceremonies like this one, it is brought to the floor of the cathedral and attached to ropes on a pulley mechanism.

The ceremony was in remembrance of those killed in the train crash which happened just outside the city on July 24, 2013.

King Felipe, who succeeded his father to the throne in June, gave a reading at the ceremony, which also marked the one year anniversary of the death of the 79 people killed in the train crash

It happened when an Aviva high speed train travelling from Madrid to Ferrol derailed on a curve of track about 4km from Santiago de Compostela railway station.

The train’s data recorder showed that it was travelling at 118mph - about twice the speed limit.

Its driver, Francis José Garzón Amo, was charged with 79 counts of homicide by professional recklessness.

He was also charged with an undetermined number of counts of causing injury after 140 people of the 222 on board were injured.

The crash, which was captured on video, was Spain’s worst rail disaster in 40 years.

Many of the passengers were said to be travelling to the fiesta celebrating St James – the same ceremony that was marked yesterday.
