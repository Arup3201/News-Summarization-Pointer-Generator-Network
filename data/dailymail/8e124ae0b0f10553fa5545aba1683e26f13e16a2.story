Javier Mascherano hailed Lionel Messi's impact on Barcelona's march into the Champions League on Wednesday night at Manchester City's expense.

'I have never seen anything like him (Messi). It is the way he dominates a game that sets him apart, ' said the Argentine who also admitted the problems the club had earlier in the season have helped knock them into shape.

He said: 'A clip around the ear can sometimes shake you up and be the best thing.'

Full-back Jordi Alba added: 'Messi is the best player in the world and he gave another recital tonight.'

Mascherano admitted trying to advise Barca keeper Marc Andre ter Stegen on which way to dive for Sergio Aguero's penalty. 'I know from international duty how he takes spot-kicks' said the midfielder.

The Barca keeper admitted being advised by both Mascherano and Rafinha but in the end made his own mind up and stopped Aguero's shot.

The German keeper saved a Messi spot kick in a game against Argentina and had studied his compatriot's record from the spot.

It was Manchester City Joe Hart who impressed Barca coach Luis Enrique. He said: 'The game would have ended earlier if it had not been for Hart, his performance was spectacular.'

And the rest of Spain was left in awe at the display. La Liga statistician Mister Chip tweeted that his performance was the best since Iker Casillas – the last keeper to make 10 saves in the competition in one game – against Juventus in the group stages in 2013.

Hart's 10 stops came after he saved the penalty in the first leg that kept the game open in the second leg.

Many Spanish supporters took to Twitter to hail Hart's display. One tweet read: 'Hart has made more saves tonight than Iker Casillas all season.' His performance even had some speculating on the possibility that he will now be on Real Madrid's all-encompassing radar.

Barcleona now go into Sunday's Clasico in fine form. Alba added: 'The Clasico is always different but a big win always gives a team confidence.'
