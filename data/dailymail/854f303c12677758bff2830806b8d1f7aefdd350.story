A surge in child sex abuse cases reported to Victoria Police shows the problem is no longer being swept under the carpet, political leaders say.

The number of cases reported annually in Victoria surged 43 per cent in the five years to the 2013/14 financial year.

There was also a 90 per cent increase in cases where a parent was the alleged perpetrator.

'I think those figures reflect, on the advice that I have, an increased reporting rate and I welcome an increased reporting rate,' Victorian premier Denis Napthine told reporters on Saturday.

'The increased awareness of child sexual abuse is bringing to the fore cases that were under the carpet, behind closed doors.'

Opposition leader Daniel Andrews said it resulted from a new 'culture of extra reporting, courage, transparency, and people feeling safe to come forward and report those despicable crimes'.

A justice system overhaul was also needed, Mr Andrews said, and Labor would hold a royal commission into family violence in 2015 should it win the November state election.

Fairfax, which published the figures, has also reported concerning trends observed by police and support services.

They are seeing more cases of children instigating sexualised behaviour at primary schools, men pretending to be boys online so they can trick girls into exchanging explicit photos, and sexual abuse of girls after arranged marriages.
