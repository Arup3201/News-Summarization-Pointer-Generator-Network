In the letter, Lennon seeks to help the New York television personality better understand his wife's work.

Lennon writes: 'I know you're a musician at heart! and especially I know you dig jazz.—Well, Yoko's music ain't quite jazz but to help you get off on it, or understand it, please listen to a track on the 'Yoko/Ono/Plastic Ono Band,' called 'AOS,' which was recorded in 1968 (pre Lennon/Beatles!) with Ornette Coleman at Albert Hall London, you could call it free form, anyway Yoko sits in the middle of avante-garde, classic, jazz—and now through me and my music—rock 'n' roll!

He continues: 'On the new album 'Fly' the experiment goes a step 'further'—free form music—with robot musicians! (not computer—electronic—)—check the inside of Fly double-album for info and photo of the 'musicians,' of course Yoko can explain her music better in person, this is a kind of introduction.

'For something rather more 'straight,' a track called 'Mrs. Lennon' on 'Fly' is an example of her more conservative side! She was trained as a classical musician, and took music composition in Sarah Lawrence College as her major. It's far out, but don't let it frighten you. With love.'

Lennon signs off with a thumbnail sketch of himself and Yoko along with a postscript.

'The book 'Grapefruit' speaks for itself,' he adds, 'now in its 4th edition paperback. Yoko calls them, 'instructions' to help you through life rather than poetry!'

Also for sale is a mono black/gold first pressing of the Beatles' album Please Please Me signed by every member of the band in blue ballpoint pen

Each page of the letter is adorned with a red rubber stamp of Lennon's sketch of the pair and a pointing finger. 

Bobby Livingston, exec vp at RR Auction which is facilitating the letter's sale as part of it's Oct. 16 Marvels of Modern Music Auction, said the letter shows how proud John was of his oft-maligned wife.

'John writes to convince Franklin about Yoko's abilities and talents, validating her by noting that she worked with Ornette Colman at the Royal Albert Hall in 1968,' Livingston notes. 'He also urges Franklin to listen to a song on her 'Fly' album'

A limited edition Paul McCartney Epiphone 'Texan' six-string acoustic guitar from 1964 will also be auctioned off

Lennon likely wrote the letter by way of introduction for a possible guest spot for Yoko on Franklin's show.

However, it does not appear that John and Yoko ever made the appearance.

Also for sale in the auction are Bob Dylan's handwritten lyrics from an early 1961 Greenwich Village performance, stock transfer forms for the Beatles signed by every band member in 1969, and a mono black/gold first pressing of the Beatles' album Please Please Me signed by every member of the band in blue ballpoint pen. 

A limited edition Paul McCartney Epiphone 'Texan' six-string acoustic guitar from 1964 will also be auctioned off.

As far as non-Beatles memorabilia, the Guitar of Hope will also be sold.

That instrument was signed by 50 musicians and entertainers to support a family experiencing a personal battle with cancer.

Signatures on the instrument come from Ariana Grande, Britney Spears, Fergie, Taylor Swift, and the cast of Glee among others.
