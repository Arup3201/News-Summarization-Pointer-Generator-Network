A rapist offered fellow inmates $20,000 cash, a Mercedes-Benz and a $14,000 ring so they would kill his victim before she testified against him, court documents have claimed.

Tony Dotson, who was convicted of raping one of his fiancee's friends at knife point in 2012 after staging a burglary at her home, tried to recruit inmates at the Van Cise-Simonet Detention Center in Denver, Colorado before she could appear in court, the grand jury indictment said.

It claims that the 41-year-old bought canteen items at the prison - with $6,691 that a friend had put in his inmate account - to win over gang members to help with his plan.

Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey's office told the Denver Post that Dotson tried to solicit gang members from the Eight Tres Gangster Crips, the Gallant Knights Insane and the 211 Crew.

The indictment detailed how one of Dotson's friends took $1,000 from the inmate account as partial payment that would then be passed from one gang member to another to carry out the murder.

But those two gang members were later arrested and indicted, leaving them unable to commit the killing, the indictment explained.

Not to be put off, Dotson allegedly continued to try to negotiate the murder-for-hire scheme with gang members, the indictment said.

If found guilty of the 
solicitation-to-commit murder charge, he could get 24 years in prison. 
He is also facomh 31 years to life in prison the rape, but has yet to be
 sentenced.

The conviction comes after Dotson staged a burglary so he could rape a friend of his fiancÃ©e during the early hours of May 21, 2012.

In 2007, he was also the last person to see his sister Nonnie Dotson, a nurse in the U.S. Air Force, who vanished while on a trip to see him before Thanksgiving in 2006.

Nonnie, 33, left behind her 16-month-daughter. The father, Ed Vehle, had reportedly not wanted her to have the child and before her disappearance, Nonnie had gained child support for her.

Mystery: Dotson's sister Nonnie, pictured above, vanished as she was staying with her brother in 2006. Authorities have now listed the case as a homicide investigation but it has never been solved

The case has never been solved. It was initially listed as a missing persons case but now is a homicide investigation.

'She asked me to look after Savannah for a couple hours and she walked out that door and we never saw her again,' Tony Dotson had told police at the time.
