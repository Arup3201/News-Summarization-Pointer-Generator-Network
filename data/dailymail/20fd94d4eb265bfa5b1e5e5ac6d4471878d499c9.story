Andy Murray somehow turned what looked like being a victory over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga into a Rodgers Cup quarter-final defeat on Friday.

The Scot lost a tight opener on the tie-break and appeared set to bow out at the quarter-final stage when he offered up two break points at 4-4 in the second.

He hung tough to save his serve, though, and then broke the Frenchman - conqueror of Novak Djokovic on Thursday - before running away into a 3-0 lead in the decider.

But he inexplicably crumbled, losing five games in a row before slumping to a 7-6 4-6 6-4 loss.

Looking up: Murray had looked to be in control after winning the second set but he let his third-set lead slip

Powering on: Tsonga was eventually able to beat the Scot in three sets in a pulsating clash in Toronto

He was visibly frustrated as his chances disappeared in front of him, with Tsonga deserving immense credit for his fightback.

The see-saw nature of the second and third sets was entirely out of keeping with the opener which Tsonga won on a tie-break after 12 consecutive holds of serve. He got ahead in the breaker when Murray hit a forehand long.

The pair traded breaks early in the second set and Murray then looked set for straight-sets exit when he offered up two more break points. 

He found a way to save them, however, and then broke himself before winning the set to love.

He carried that confidence into the decider and was soon 3-0 ahead as Tsonga got erratic, before the tables turned dramatically.

Getting into the swing: Murray has played well at times in the tournament as he gears up for the US Open

'I had to play around my return position quite a lot, and I started to get into more service games in the second and third set,' Murray told atp.com after the match.

'I thought it was a high-level match with a few games by both of us in the second and third sets that were a bit scrappy.

'Jo is a top player. He's a fantastic athlete. When his game is on, he's very tough to beat.'
