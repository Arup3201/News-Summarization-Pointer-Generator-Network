Two murals have appeared in Paris bearing the hallmarks of work by Banksy sparking rumours the British artist has set up residency in the French capital. 

The anonymous graffiti artist recently completed a month-long residency in October in New York.

A website also went live on Sunday called Banksy-Paris.com which bears a striking resemblance to his New York site - BanksyNY.com.

Is this a Banksy? The mural appeared at Passage des Postes in the city's fifth arrondissement sparking rumours the British artist is in Paris

The first mural which appeared at Passage des Postes in the city's fifth arrondissement has the tag line on the website: 'I like wine and baguette, does that mean I'm French?'

The second is on Rue Piemontesi in the 18th arrondissement.

French photographer David Chapelle tweeted: 'Someone just told me that Banksy is in Paris for a new exhibition' along with the address of the website. 

However, many have claimed that the murals are fakes.

According to magazine Les Inrocks, Banksy's agent said: 'He doesn't have a project for the short-to-medium future'.

Chapelle has said he has also received an email from someone claiming 
to be Banksy's agent which read: 'You've obviously seen that an agent of
Banksy's has made a denial.

French photographer David Chapelle tweeted the URL for the website and says he has been contacted by his agent confirming the artist is in Paris

'The problem is, I'm also Banksy's agent and we've had no contact from InRocks.

'It's up to you to decide which agent
is right! Anyway, I'm sending you this photo, a clue for tomorrow 
perhaps!' according to The Local. 

Although the artist has never confirmed his identity, his real name is believed to be Robin Gunningham from Bristol.

Previously photographs purporting to show Banksy were taken in Santa Monica in 2011 and East London in 2007.

Both images were of a white man in his 30s of average build with brown hair. 

Banksy,
whose work has been painted on the sides of buildings around Bristol, 
London and other cities, has always insisted he will never reveal his 
true identity.
