A retired company director who was forced to wait more than six hours for an ambulance died later that day in hospital.

On the day Rodney Butcher became seriously unwell, East Midlands Ambulance Service was 'struggling to cope' - and paramedics had to be called out three times before the pensioner was seen.

The 76-year-old had developed a severe infection and his GP had requested an ambulance to take him to hospital within four hours.

Mr Butcher arrived at the Royal Derby Hospital more than two hours later than planned and was taken straight to accident and emergency department

But, when it did not arrive on time, concerned staff at Mr Butcher’s nursing home rang 999 twice.

An inquest into his death heard these calls actually made the situation worse because they cancelled out the original request for an ambulance and caused further delay.

It meant that Mr Butcher, of Ashbourne, Derbyshire, arrived at the Royal Derby Hospital more than two hours later than planned and was taken straight to accident and emergency department, where he later died.

Although the inquest heard the delay did not contribute to his death, EMAS said it had now reviewed its policy on how it deals with separate calls to a single incident.

Derby and South Derbyshire Coroner’s Court heard how Mr Butcher was receiving respite care at the Old Lodge Nursing Home, in Etwall, in November 2012.

Mr Butcher was receiving respite care at the Old Lodge Nursing Home, for type-two diabetes, Parkinson¿s disease and Alzheimer's disease

At the time, Mr Butcher was suffering from type-two diabetes, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer's disease.

Signs of a bladder infection prompted staff at the home to call an out-of-hours emergency care practitioner to take a look at him.

The inquest heard the practitioner, Stephen Meakins, diagnosed Mr Butcher with a urinary tract infection.

He was put on antibiotics and care home staff were told to seek further medical help if his condition deteriorated.

Three days later, Mr Butcher’s condition had worsened, so staff called in Dr Michael Vickers, of the Wellbrook Medical Centre, for another check-up and at 2.30pm the GP diagnosed him with 'uncontrolled diabetes and possible urinary sepsis'.

He said: 'It was fairly apparent he needed to be in hospital.'

Dr Vickers returned to his surgery and at 2.50pm requested an ambulance to arrive within four hours and take Mr Butcher to the Royal Derby hospital.

He said, on reflection, he should have called for an ambulance within two hours - but the inquest heard this would have been equally difficult for EMAS because of flooding and poor weather conditions.

At 7.34pm care home staff rang 999 because he was concerned by the ambulance delay and said Mr Butcher had become 'very pale'. They were also called at 8.11pm.

But Alison Crowe, service delivery manager for the emergency operations centre at EMAS, told the inquest how the original request for an ambulance was effectively cancelled and replaced by the new request.

An ambulance eventually arrived at the care home at 9.27pm and reached the hospital at 10.28pm.

Ms Crowe said EMAS’s policies had now been reviewed to avoid this issue arising again.

Assistant coroner Paul McCandless, recording a narrative conclusion, said it was “more likely than not' that Mr Butcher would have died even if he had arrived at hospital on time.

The medical cause of Mr Butcher’s death was given as diabetic ketoacidosis - a condition caused by high blood glucose levels due to a bladder infection.

After the inquest, a spokesman for EMAS apologised to Mr Butcher’s family and said: 'We have reviewed our policies to make sure this does not happen again.'

Mr Butcher’s family said they wanted to thank the ambulance service for 'putting their hands up' over the incident.
