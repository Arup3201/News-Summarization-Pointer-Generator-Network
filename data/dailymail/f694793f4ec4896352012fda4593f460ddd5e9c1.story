The United States has evacuated its remaining 100 Special Operations forces members from Yemen.

This due to the country's deteriorating security situation, as was witnessed on Friday when four suicide bombers in explosive vests killed 137 and injured hundreds more when they walked into the Badr and al-Hashoosh mosques in the capital city of Sanaa and unleashed what is now being called one of the deadliest attacks ever in the country.

A fifth suicide bomber detonated his device outside the gates to one of the mosques. 

ISIS has since taken responsibility for the attack, but it is still not confirmed if they were in fact behind the bombings. 

What's more, hundreds of members of al Qaeda managed to escape from Yemeni prisons on Thursday and Friday.

In addition, the Houthis issued a call to arms on Saturday to fight those loyal to the embattled President Hadi.

CNN reports that Navy SEALs and members of the Army's Delta Force are among those who were at the Al Anad airbase in Yemen and are now being sent out of the country.

The United States had already closed its embassy in Sanaa last month. 

This after years spent working with Yemen in a quest to topple the terrorist organization al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

AQAP, which is based in the country, claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo shooting earlier this year in Paris.

Further complicating matters in the country is the power struggle between President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Houthi rebels. 

The Houthis are a Shia group that has only recently gained power in the country after taking over the government in a coup-d'etat that some believe was funded by Iran. 

In January of this year, Houthi rebels seized the presidential palace, and by February they had taken control of the government. 

It was at this point most Americans were withdrawn from the country and the embassy was shuttered. 

The Houthis also launched a strike against President Hadi just days ago at a palace he was staying at in the port city of Aden, the country's temporary capital.  

That same day 13 people were killed and 21 were injured as supporters of President Hadi and Houthi rebels battled in the same city. 

Then on Saturday, the Houthis issued a call to arms to attack supporters of President Hadi.

This after President Hadi called the Houthis overtaking of the government 'a coup against constitutional legitimacy' in one of his first speeches in weeks.

He also urged that all groups attend a peace talk in the Saudi city of Riyadh, and no doubt upset the Houthis when he also announced his plan to place a national flag in the city of Sa'dah, the Houthi base.

Above all else he said he wanted unity for the country.

Meanwhile, should ISIS indeed be behind Friday's attack, that would make the situation even more dire as though they and al Qaeda are both extremist Sunni groups, the two have spoken out against one another in the past with al Qaeda finding many ISIS acts and attacks far too extreme.

Making ISIS's role in the bombings more likely is the January decree of al Qaeda senior leader Harith an-Nadhari who spoke against the shedding of 'unlawful blood,' such as attacks in mosques.

The United States has said however they still cannot confirm who is behind the attacks.
