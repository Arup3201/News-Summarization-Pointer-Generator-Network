The centre forward: The leader from the front, the No 9, the provider, the talisman, the goalscorer. Since 1992, the Premier League has been blessed with the best, from homegrown talents Alan Shearer and Andy Cole, to foreign imports Tony Yeboah and Thierry Henry.

In this international week, we are begging for goals, and these lot put the ball in the back of the net and make it look easy.

Here, Sportsmail runs you through Nos 30-21 of the best strikers to have ever graced the Premier League... do you agree?

30. Emile Heskey (Leicester City, Liverpool, Birmingham City, Wigan Athletic, Aston Villa)

Heskey may have sadly become a figure of ridicule in his later career but you can't question his goal record. The powerful frontman notched 110 in the Premier League, the majority coming in his time with Leicester City and Liverpool.

His finest hour came in the 2000-01 campaign, when 22 goals in 56 matches for Liverpool helped them to a treble of FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup.

29. Robbie Keane (Coventry City, Leeds United, Tottenham, Liverpool, West Ham, Aston Villa)

Goal machine Keane scored 194 times while a player in England, the majority of them in the Premier League. 

He first impressed at Wolves and was sold for £6m to Coventry while still a teenager. Twelve league goals convinced Inter Milan to sign the Irishman but it was a short-lived stay and he went via Leeds United to Tottenham. It was here he scored the majority of his Premier League goals, reaching double figures in five successive campaigns and winning the club's Player of the Year award on three occasions.

A £19m move to Liverpool proved unsuccessful and Keane returned to north London. He scored 126 Premier League goals in all.

28. Kevin Phillips (Sunderland, Southampton, Aston Villa, Birmingham, Crystal Palace)

Phillips developed into a formidable striker when at Sunderland, powering them back into the Premier League in 1999 with 23 goals in 26 matches and then, continuing his fearsome 'little and large' partnership with Niall Quinn, was top scorer with 30 in 1999-00. Sunderland finished seventh on their return to the big time, with Phillips the star.

In 2002, he scored a crucial last-day goal against Derby to secure their survival but moved to Southampton when they went down the following year. 

Phillips continued his rich vein of form for the Saints, scoring 22 goals in two seasons and later enjoyed prolific seasons for West Brom, Birmingham and Blackpool.

27. Chris Sutton (Norwich, Blackburn, Chelsea, Birmingham, Aston Villa)

Few adapted as quickly to the new Premier League in 1992 as Sutton, powering Norwich to third spot and then adding 25 goals the following season. He became the most expensive player in English football when Blackburn bought him for £5m in 1994 but proved his worth by forming a deadly 'SAS' partnership with Alan Shearer as Rovers upset the odds to win the title.

He scored 15 times and Shearer 34 during an unforgettable campaign. He never quite reached those heights again but was the league's joint-top scorer with 18 in 1997-98. 

Sutton flopped at Chelsea after Blackburn suffered relegation in 1999 but found his scoring touch again in Scotland with 86 goals for Celtic.

26. Jurgen Klinsmann (Tottenham Hotspur)

Klinsmann's time in the Premier League may have been brief but, mein Gott, what an impact he made. 

The German was a figure of hate when he surprisingly turned up at Tottenham in 1994; he was perceived as a shameless diver and had been part of the team that left England heart-broken at the 1990 World Cup. But all was forgiven and forgotten as Klinsmann powered in 20 league goals for Spurs, some marked with a self-deprecating dive celebration. His second stint at White Hart Lane, in 1997-98, helped rescue them from relegation.

25. Fernando Torres (Liverpool, Chelsea)

Let's put his measly return at Chelsea to one side - a £50m price tag having weighed a little too heavily on his shoulders - and remember the best of Fernando Torres at Liverpool.

The Spanish star scored 65 league goals in 102 appearances for the Reds - some feat - and was worshipped like a God. He arrived from Atletico Madrid for £20m in 2007 and opened his account against Chelsea. 

Torres' league scoring totals at Anfield read 24, 14, 18 and nine. He was a man for the big occasions, too, scoring important goals against the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United, not to mention 12 goals in three Champions League seasons.

Having moved to Chelsea for £50million, Torres struggled for form in west London and that price tag weighed heavily

24. Paolo Di Canio (Sheffield Wednesday, West Ham, Charlton Athletic)

We all know about Di Canio's volcanic temperament, but let's remember some of the glorious goals he scored during his time in England. 

The Italian arrived at Sheffield Wednesday for £4.2m and scored 14 goals in his debut season to become a real fans' favourite (that shove on referee Paul Alcock aside).

He scored 48 league goals in his five seasons with West Ham, including the Goal of the Season in 1999-00 for a flying volley against Wimbledon, still one of the best seen in the Premier League era.

After Manchester United made attempts to sign him in 2001, Di Canio suffered relegation in 2003 and went on to Charlton.

23. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink (Leeds United, Chelsea, Middlesbrough, Charlton Athletic)

Surely one of the bargains of the Premier League era, deadly Dutchman Hasselbaink was signed by George Graham at Leeds United for just £2m.  He would quickly repay that fee with 34 goals in two seasons before being being sold for £12m to Atletico Madrid.

He returned to England with Chelsea just a year later for a club record £15m and again proved great value for money. His 23 goals in 2000-01 - including a memorable volley against Man United - made him the league's second highest scorer. 

In tandem with Eidur Gudjohnsen, he matched that the following season, helping Chelsea to the FA Cup final, too. Hasselbaink also went on to score 22 times for Middlesbrough in two years.

22. Robin van Persie (Arsenal, Manchester United)

The Dutchman ranks as one of modern football's most prolific scorers and would have plundered more but for persistent injury problems. 

Nonetheless, he scored 96 in 194 league games for Arsenal between 2004 and 2012 including a glorious airborne volley against Charlton in 2006 that Arsene Wenger described as 'the goal of a lifetime.' His best season for Arsenal was his final one – with 30 in 38 – and convinced Man United to pay £22m for him.

A 26-goal haul in his debut season earned RVP a coveted Premier League winner's medal.

21. Nicolas Anelka (Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City, Bolton Wanderers, Chelsea, West Brom)

Sulky but often silky, controversial but consistent in his scoring, Nicolas Anelka was the striker who refused to say farewell to the Premier League. 

He made his breakthrough at Arsenal as a 17-year-old, helping them to their first 'Double' in 1998 and he was their top scorer the following season too before his first Grand Depart. 

After time at Real Madrid and a loan spell at Liverpool, Anelka's scoring ability persuaded Kevin Keegan to break Man City's transfer record - then a mere £13m - in 2002 and he scored 37 league goals for them. He spent two years at Bolton after a spell at Fenerbahce before moving to Chelsea for £15m, helping them to a Premier League title and two FA Cup triumphs.
