Angel Cabrera claimed his first PGA Tour win outside of the major championships with a final-round 64 at the Greenbrier Classic.

The Argentinian, who won the 2007 US Open and 2009 Masters, finished 16 under par at White Sulphur Springs to hold off the emotional charge of George McNeill, whose 61 included a hole in one at the eighth.

McNeill’s consolation is a qualifying place for the Open Championship - though it remains to be seen if he will make the trip to Royal Liverpool, having already pulled out of next week’s John Deere Classic due to a family illness.

Champion: Argentine Angel Cabrera won the Greenbrier Classic in White Sulphur Springs

Success: It was the Argentine's first career PGA Tour win outside of the majors

Pedigree: Cabrera has won two major championships, the 2009 Masters and the 2007 US Open

His ace was one of two on the day, emulated by Bud Cauley at the 18th.

Cabrera produced the next best thing by holing his 175-yard approach for an eagle two at the 14th and - despite a pair of bogeys after that - he held his nerve to complete a two-stroke victory.

He told Sky Sports 4 afterwards:'I needed this, I’ve been working really hard and I’m really happy I won.

'I hit it very solidly, I was under control and the work we’ve been doing paid off.'

McNeill is joined by Chris Stroud, Cameron Tringale and overnight leader Billy Hurley III in qualifying for the Open, with four places available to the top finishers not already exempt.

The latter trio actually shared fourth place on nine under par with Cauley and Will Wilcox, but got the nod due to their superior world rankings.

A post on the official Open Championship Twitter feed shortly after the end of the round read: "Congratulations to George McNeill, @ChrisStroudPGA , @CamTringalePGA, and @BillyHurley3 on qualifying for £TheOpen. See you at @RLGCHoylake!"

Ace: George McNeill was one of two golfers on the final day to shoot hole in ones

A long 
putt for birdie at the third set the wheels in motion for Cabrera, who 
picked up further shots with pin-high approaches at the fifth and 
seventh seeing him out in 31.

He
 knocked in a good 20-foot putt at the 11th, calmly holed out for birdie
 at the next and punched the air as his perfect iron into the next 
checked left and rolled into the hole.

With
 a three-shot lead, it seemed the tournament was wrapped up - but he 
misjudged his chips at the next two holes and was unable to save par on 
either occasion.

Par
 at 16 and birdie at the long 17th steadied the ship and victory was 
completed with a tap-in after an excellent first putt along the side of 
the huge ridge running across the final green.

McNeill
 produced a spectacular front nine of 28, with his 219-yard hole in one 
following four straight birdies for a run of three-three-three-three-one
 from the fourth.

Three
 more birdies followed on the back nine as McNeill kept himself together
 amid emotional turmoil, with his older sister Michelle seriously ill.

Liverpool-bound: Chris Stroud was one of the players who qualified for the Open Championship at Hoylake

'Sometimes golf doesn't mean a whole lot," he said in a tearful post-round interview. 'It's hard.

'I played good today, it was a good middle part of the round but like I said, golf doesn't mean all that much.'

His 61 equalled the best round of the week, matching Troy Matteson's effort on day two.Webb Simpson, the 2012 US Open champion, finished third on his own at 10 under par after a bogey-free, seven-under-par 63.

Cauley's
 ace meant he picked up four shots in the last four holes for a 64, but 
as others came in at nine under he was edged out of the Open.

One-under-par
 69s were enough for Stroud and Tringale, while Hurley clung on despite 
finishing with a disappointing 73. The former Navy lieutenant had led 
after 36 and 54 holes.
