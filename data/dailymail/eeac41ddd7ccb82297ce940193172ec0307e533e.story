Inspired by the self-driving hoverchairs in Wall-E, an inventor has created a one-wheeled vehicle controlled using signals from his brain.

Dubbed Cycoped, the rechargeable device connects to a smartphone app and a pair of specially-designed goggles.

These goggles register the rider's brain impulses before sending them to the app, which controls the novel mode of transport.

The Cycoped was designed by 24-year-old Pretom Chakraborty from Birmingham. It is controlled using electrical impulses in his brain via specially-designed goggles (pictured). The goggles then send these signals to a smartphone app via Bluetooth

It was created by 24-year-old inventor Pretom Chakraborty from Edgbaston, Birmingham.

The goggles pick up signals by monitoring changes in electrical impulses released by his brain.

These signals are sent to the app via Bluetooth and are converted into commands, including accelerate and decelerate.

Cycpoed weighs almost four stone (55lbs or 25kg) and reaches speeds of 16mph (25km/h).

It then travels up to 18 miles (28km) on a four-hour electric charge.

It can also be steered by leaning to the side, similar to how Segways and the AirWheel work.

The freelance designer said: ‘The original idea came after watching 2008 Pixar film Wall-E in which human beings control hover crafts with their brains.

‘I wanted to create the Cycoped to use the least amount of energy possible.

‘I worked alongside mechanics in order to create my design, before ordering the plastic mould from China.’

It then travels up to 18 miles (28km) on a four-hour electric charge, which works out at just 25p a trip.

Mr Pretom additionally designed the goggles to detect risk and safety impulses released by different areas of the user's brain.

When the goggles detect these impulses they communicate with the Cycoped via the app to accelerate or slow down.

This is named 'psycho mode', because the device is psychologically controlled.

It is this technology which led to the name Cycoped - a mixture of a moped, unicycle and psychological technology.

Mr Pretom continued: ‘It is still early days, at the moment there is no restriction for road use.

‘I am constantly working on the Cycoped, incorporating new technologies day-by-day, in order to eventually have the product market-ready.’

The latest addition to the Cycoped is a Bluetooth based motion sensitive tracker.

Mr Pretom, who has spent the last 18 months working on this incredible invention, admitted he has ended up in hospital during tests, fracturing both of his wrists.

‘After having a fall, I could then go back to the design and correct the problem that caused the accident.’

‘Money is not important to me, I would much prefer that my design helps people that have to travel miles for water every day.

‘I'd love for it to be available to those that have to walk for hours just to get to school.

‘I am planning on continuing to work on the Cycoped and look forward to adding and altering the design until I'm happy that it is complete.’
