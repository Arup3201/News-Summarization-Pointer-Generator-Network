This is the moment two heartless thieves stole £700 of Christmas money from an elderly couple after pretending to ask for directions.

Moments earlier the ‘despicable’ con artists had followed the couple – both aged in their 80s – around a bank and watched them withdraw their savings.

CCTV cameras capture the moment one of the men distracts the grandparents by pretending to be lost, while his partner swoops. 

Criminals: Police are hunting for two thieves who stole a vulnerable couple's £700 Christmas savings by distracting them claiming they were lost

Sickening: One man asked the pensioners for directions while the other rifled through a bag and stole a wallet

As the pensioners load their shopping into the boot of their car, one man keeps them engaged in conversation, encouraging them to turn their backs to the vehicle.

Meanwhile, his accomplice can be seen lurking in the background before he sneaks up behind them. He then reaches into the woman’s handbag, snatches her purse and walks off.

The first thief then quickly concludes his conversation, appearing to thank the pensioners for their directions, before following his accomplice.

Yesterday, West Midlands Police released the 45-second CCTV footage in a bid to catch the men. Hundreds posted links to the footage on Facebook and Twitter in a bid to find the ‘vile’ thieves.

Do you know these men? Detectives believe these are the men responsible for the wallet snatch

Detective Sergeant Dave Faries said the men struck at 10.30am on November 25, on Thamley Road in Coventry.

He added: ‘This was a well-planned theft in which the suspects coldly and deliberately targeted the elderly couple.

‘Not only did they follow them in the bank, but they also shadowed them as they carried out their shopping, waiting for the right time to pounce.’

He said the couple had withdrawn the money for Christmas presents for their family and thankfully, ‘in the spirit of the festive season’, Coventry Building Society refunded the cash.

‘However, I will not rest until these despicable thieves are identified and brought to justice,’ Mr Faries added.

‘We have carried out numerous inquiries in the area and checked police systems to try and identify the suspects, but now we need the public’s help to trace them.

‘I’d also like to urge people to be on their guard against such tactics and if a stranger approaches you in the street, make sure you keep an eye on your belongings and report any suspicious activity to police.’ 

Cynical: The gang had been following the couple since they withdrew the money from a cashpoint

Distraction: The ringleader then spoke to the pensioners claiming they had lost their way while the accomplice lurked behind

Kind: The couple politely turn round to face the man but doing so allow the other thief to sneak in and steal

Exit: As soon as the wallet was stolen the thieves fled and police are desperate to track them down

Distraction theft is not uncommon and it is believed these men may be travelling from town to town to evade police.

In September, three thieves were captured on CCTV using a similar technique – distracting a frail elderly man as he took money out of a cashpoint, and taking his bank cards and cash.

Yesterday, one woman, who didn’t give her name, wrote on MailOnline that her 84-year-old mother also experienced almost identical tactics. She said thieves ‘followed her into the Halifax, watched her withdraw £800 and then distracted her while another member went down her shopping trolley and stole it’.

She added: ‘The whole sorry incident was caught on CCTV but all the police said was they were aware of the gang operating in our part of Suffolk and she has heard nothing from them since.’

On Twitter, users described the thieves as ‘disgusting’ and ‘vile scumbags’.

In the footage, one of the men is wearing a black leather jacket with a white patterned jumper while his bald accomplice has a moustache and is wearing a black puffa jacket with a white hood.

Anyone who knows the identity of the men is urged to call police on 101, or the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
