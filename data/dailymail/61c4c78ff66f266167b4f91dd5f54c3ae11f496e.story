A Turkish doctor suffered a double heart attack live on air during a popular health show.

Dr Ugur Yansel, a professor of orthopaedics, was speaking to the show's presenter Arzu Kilicc about the issues involving flat feet in children when he suddenly lunged forward and clutched his chest.

The host of the popular 'Healthy Living' ('Saglikli Yasam') programme - which attracts millions of viewers - on the 360 channel, based in Istanbul, asked if he was okay.

After taking a glass of water, Dr Yansel appeared to regain his composure - only to be hit by a second, more severe, heart attack. 

Ms Kilicc asks: 'Are you feeling well, professor?' and suggested he take a sip of water.

'It's something to do with my pacemaker,' he replied, pointing to his chest.

The presenter, who remained calm throughout the show, ended the broadcast with a smile on her face, saying: 'It's time to take care of our doctor now, and the commercials.'

Dr Yansel was moved to the backstage area where he had a third heart attack. 

He was taken to a hospital by ambulance and is reported to be in a stable condition 

Experts said that the doctor, who is in his late 50s, had already been displaying classic heart attack symptoms such as chest pain and discomfort before suffering the first attack.
