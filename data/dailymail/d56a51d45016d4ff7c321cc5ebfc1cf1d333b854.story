Former Brighton and Watford coach Oscar Garcia has turned down the chance to become Barcelona’s new sporting director because he wants to manage again in England.

Garcia spoke with Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu this week about the possibility of replacing Andoni Zubizarreta who was sacked on Monday but the 41-year-old was not convinced the move is right for him because he wants to get back on the training ground after so nearly taking Brighton to the Premier league in 2013.

As a former Barca players and youth team coach who led the under-19 team to an unprecedented treble in 2011 Barcelona fans want him brought back into the fold at the Nou Camp.

But his desire to go on coaching means he has passed on the opportunity to replace Zubizarreta.

After his successful spell at Barca and time spent working with Johan Cruyff as coach of the Catalan national side Garcia moved to Maccabi Tel Aviv and lead them to their first league title in 2010.

He then moved to Brighton and after replacing Gus Poyet as manager in 2013 he led the team to the play-offs.

Barcelona have also looked at former stand in coach Jordi Roura and Fiorentina’s Eduardo Macia as possible replacements for Zubizarreta.

Macia is a former Liverpool scout who has also worked at Valencia and Olympiacos and was responsible for signing Micah Richards in the summer. Roura stood in for the late Tito Vilanova when he could no continue as first team coach because of his illness.

Barca could even delay the appointment of a new sporting director indefinitely now that elections have been called for the end of the season. They are banned from signing new players in 2015 and each presidential candidate will have his own prospective sporting Director when he stands for office in June.
