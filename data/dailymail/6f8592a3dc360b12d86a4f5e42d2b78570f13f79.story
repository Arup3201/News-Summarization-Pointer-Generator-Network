A brave nine-year-old boy has given a graphic and detailed statement to Oklahoma police about his mother, who allegedly sexually and physically abused her three other children repeatedly as her friends paid to watch.

Authorities in Beckham county were alerted to the accusations against Natalie Lynn Webb, 30, in August after a Department of Human Services investigator spoke to the eldest child and reported that Webb was 'selling sex' with her kids to other adults.

According to the police affidavit - obtained by The Huffington Post and almost completely based on an interview with the nine-year-oldÂ  - the victims were an eight-year-old boy and his two three-year-old sisters.

The affidavit says Webb would usher people into her bedroom or bathroom and 'drag' in both three-year-old girls.

The adults were both male and female.

It claims Webb would be naked during these incidents, which are said to have occurred on numerous occasions from December 2012 to March 2013 at her home in Elk City.

The nine-year-old said Webb would lock the door and that he would hear his sisters screaming 'stop Momma, stop, it hurts', the report says.

He witnessed the abuse on one occasion and described a foreign object being used, the affidavit says.

One of the three-year-olds was interviewed by police and corroborated the nine-year-old's story, saying it felt 'nasty' when she was abused.

The nine-year-old said he also saw his brother being abused, but was able to avoid the molestation himself by running outside and hiding in a dumpster.

Most of the details included in the affidavit cannot be published.

After her arrest, Webb denied the allegations and demanded a polygraph test, which she failed.

The Huff Post reported the mother said to Beckham County Sheriff's investigator Steve Bonds: 'Somebody hurt 'em. I'm supposed to protect my kids.'

Bonds then replied: 'Natalie, you didn't.'

The allegations are said to have occurred inside Webb's home in Fairview Village, Elk City

Webb confessed to police she often used methamphetamine and sold it out of her house.

She told authorities she sometimes traded her food stamps for meth.

The nine-year-old said he would find needles but never saw his mom using drugs.

He also found pipes that 'smelt really bad' and that 'her arm would have little dots where it was bleeding', the affidavit says.

He said his mom would act 'different' and 'weird' when she used drugs and would often fall asleep on the couch

The boy said she would also leave the children alone overnight for two days and that he would after his siblings.

'[The 9-year-old] said his mom would not feed them and he would have to find stuff and cook it in the microwave or pop tarts and stuff,' the affidavit reads.

'If there was nothing [the children] would just scavenge the floor. On the floor they would find crumbs or cookies that were there from a week ago.'

There are also claims of beatings and that Webb would 'throw the children against the wall' and hit them with 'a bat that has holes in it', a spoon or her fist.

Webb has past felony convictions for child endangerment and possession of a controlled substance, along with misdemeanour convictions of unlawful possession of paraphernalia, bogus checks and unauthorized use of a credit card.

She has been charged with sexual abuse of children under 12 and child neglect

Webb is being held on a $2 million bond and is due in Beckham County Court on January 6.

Her four children are in the custody of their grandparents.
