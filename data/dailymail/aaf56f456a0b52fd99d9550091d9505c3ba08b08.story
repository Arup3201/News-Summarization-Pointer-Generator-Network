Questions: Nearly one in ten British fathers have doubts over the paternity of their children

Nearly one in ten British fathers harbour doubts over the paternity of their children, according to shocking new research.

In some parts of the country, the figure 
rises to almost one in five men who have admitted they are unsure if 
they are biological father of their children.

On average, eight per cent of British men - around 1.2million - say they have worried whether their children are their own.

That rises to 16 per cent in Newcastle, London and Northern Ireland, research revealed.

However, in Yorkshire and Scotland, men were far less likely to question if they were the biological parent of their children - with just three per cent admitting to having doubts.

By comparison, three per cent of British women - some 460,000 - said they were unsure of who the biological father of their child is.

The research - based on a YouGov survey of 5,266 parents on behalf of website DNATestingChoice.com - explains why more Britons are using DNA paternity testing.

The findings showed clear pockets of concern in some of Britain’s cities.

Fathers in the North East were the most likely to be unsure of male respondents representing twice the UK average.

By comparison, mothers in the North West, in cities like Liverpool and Manchester, were most likely to be unsure who the biological father of their children was with nearly 6 per cent - twice the UK average - admitting they did not know for certain.

Other factors including the age of the
 parents, occupation and marital status had a bearing on how confident 
they felt about their partner’s fidelity.

Older
 fathers proved to be more secure in their family structure, with just 
five per cent of over-55s saying they were unsure of their child’s 
paternity.

Mystery: This map shows the percentage of mothers in each region  who are unsure who the father of their child is. The problem is greatest in North West England, while Scottish mothers have the least doubts

Meanwhile this regional map shows where in the country fathers are most likely to question their child's paternity. Fathers in Northern Ireland and North East England are most likely to have doubts

However, the research showed that 15 per cent of fathers aged between 25-34 were most likely to have been unsure.

Mothers who have never married were found to be the most likely to harbour doubts about the paternity of their child.

Around eight per cent - three times the national average- of unmarried mothers replied ‘yes’ to the survey.

While 18 per cent of fathers who are separated or divorced said they have questioned the paternity of their offspring.

Craig Macpherson, of DNATestingChoice.com, said: 'We are finding an increasing number of parents turning to paternity testing to end years of uncertainty. DNA Paternity tests prove whether or not a man is the biological father of a child giving valuable reassurance.'
