England players including Kevin Pietersen, James Anderson and Stuart Broad urinated on the Oval pitch following England's 3-0 Ashes triumph on Sunday, according to an Australian journalist.

The home side were forced to settle for a draw in the final Test after poor light saw the players taken off with England 21 runs short of victory.

And a number of players allegedly returned to the pitch five hours later to take turns urinating while their team-mates cheered them on.

A picture tweeted by England's wicket keeper Matt Prior showed the squad sat on the Oval after dark surrounded by beer and champagne.

And Malcolm Conn wrote in the Herald Sun: 'While the centre of the ground was quite dark, lights were on in the grandstands with dozens of people still cleaning up after a late finish which saw the game go beyond 7.30pm

'A number of players including Stuart Broad, Kevin Pietersen and Jimmy Anderson took it in turns urinating on the pitch to the cheers of their team mates.

'This could be clearly seen from the outside overflow areas of the press box.'

Meanwhile, England chairman Giles Clarke has hit out at the way the final Test of the series was curtailed.

'It's totally unsatisfactory the way the game ended - 
the rules are clearly unacceptable and I expect [ICC chief executive] 
David Richardson to change it at the next ICC chief executives' meeting,' he said.

'It's a great moment though, the country should appreciate these 
players. I'm so proud of our team and had the privilege of giving some 
of them Ashes medals for the second time.'

England captain Alastair Cook accepted the umpires had little choice despite the crowd being denied the finale they craved.

'Of course you understand the frustration, but you can also 
understand the other side...you understand the rules and regs,' he said.

'Unfortunately the officials sometimes have to take emotion out of 
the game and do their job of being consistently fair to both sides.

'Of course it is disappointing to be sitting here when we felt we 
could have taken those runs off the last four overs, but I understand 
the umpires' decision and why it happened.

'If it was the third day no-one would be moaning about it. If the 
boot was on the other foot we'd probably be asking the same questions 
(as Australia).'
