A midwife failed to provide a first-time mother with basic medical attention during an agonising birth, a hearing has been told.

Colleen Tyler yesterday told a Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) hearing that she asked midwife Julie Louise Richards for an epidural on multiple occasions as she gave birth to her son Noah.

He was later born suffering from severe brain damage and died ten months later.

Colleen and Hywel Tyler's first child, Noah, died at the age of ten months due to brain damage that he suffered during his traumatic birth in February 2011

The misconduct panel was also told how the midwife had said Mrs Tyler ‘shouldn’t move around so much’ in the birthing pool and shouldn't ask if she should push - as she would know instinctively.

Mrs Tyler said: ‘I didn’t know what to do and I didn’t have anyone who was going to tell me.’

Ms Richards denies a lack of communication with the patient. She is also accused of failing to recognise, or act on, the fact that Noah’s heart rate was too fast.

The panel was told by Mrs Tyler and her husband, Hywel Tyler, that an epidural had been repeatedly requested, but was not given.

Instead, Mrs Tyler spent three hours in a birthing pool. Unable to get comfortable, she spent much of the time sat on her hands in an attempt to steady herself in the pool.

She said: ‘I didn’t want to get in the birthing pool. I said again and again that I wanted an epidural because the pain was that bad.

‘I just wanted an epidural so that I didn’t have to be feeling the pain anymore. In the end, I didn’t have the energy to keep asking.’

An inquest held last year found that Noah had suffered devastating brain damage after he was starved of oxygen and blood during his delivery at the University Hospital of Wales’ midwife-led unit in Cardiff in February 2011.

He died 10 months later as a result of the injuries sustained at birth.

At the time, Cardiff coroner Mary Hassell criticised Ms Richards' failure to provide Mrs Tyler with ‘basic medical attention’.

In her evidence, Mrs Tyler spoke of the pain of having lost her first-born son. She said: ‘I feel cheated of my son, because he was robbed of the life and childhood that he had every right to have.

‘In this day and age and in a country that is so progressed - that level of care, or lack of care, should never happen. If this had happened to someone else, I wouldn’t believe something like this could happen.’

Giving evidence, Ms Richards, who no longer works for the University Hospital of Wales, apologised to the family for the part she played in their son’s death.

She said: ‘I really can’t express how sorry I am for their loss and for my part in it.

‘It will be with me for every day for the rest of my life.’

The apology was first offered through her barrister, Mark Whitcombe, as Noah’s parents gave evidence.

In response, Mr Tyler said: ‘That is the first time she has expressed any sort of apology to myself and my wife.

‘We have had apologies from the hospital and from the head midwifery, but this is the first time, over two years later, that she has expressed any sort of apology.’

Ms Richards has now apologised for the part she played in Noah's injury and eventual death

Ms Richards faces serious allegations relating to three separate incidents dating back to 2008.

In the first, it is alleged she failed to recognise abnormally high blood pressure in a pregnant woman, or to inform medical staff in December 2008.

Secondly, she is said to have booked a patient in to have her labour induced without following the hospital’s labour protocols, or completing full antenatal checks, in August 2009.

In relation to Noah’s birth in February 2011, she is accused of failing to recognise or act on abnormal observations – which included that the baby’s heart rate was too fast - and to seek appropriate referral to a medical practitioner.

She is also said to have failed to communicate effectively with Mrs Tyler while she was in the birthing pool.

Ms Richards also faces serious allegations relating to two other incidents. She no longer works for the University Hospital of Wales (pictured)

She is also accused to administering drugs which had not been prescribed by a doctor and without Mrs Tyler’s consent.

Ms Richards admits the facts in all three cases, except where she is accused of a lack of communication.

The panel is set to decide today whether, on the balance of probabilities, Ms Richards failed to communicate effectively with Noah’s parents.

Later this week, the panel will decide whether Ms Richards’ fitness to practice is impaired by reason of her misconduct.
