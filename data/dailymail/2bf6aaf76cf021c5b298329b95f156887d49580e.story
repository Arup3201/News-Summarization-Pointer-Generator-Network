The Sydney Siege gunman Man Haron Monis was reportedly buried yesterday at an unknown location in New South Wales, more than a month after he was shot dead. 

Monis, a self-proclaimed sheik, was killed on December 16 after holding 18 people hostage for more than 17 hours at the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place, Sydney. 

His body was allegedly interred by the state as no one came forward to claim his remains and his partner, accused murderer Amirah Droudis, did not have the means to afford a burial.  

She allegedly is not aware of the details of the burial and gravediggers were made to sign a non-disclosure agreement, according to News Limited.

Self-professed sheif Man Haron Monis (pictured in 2011) has reportedly been buried more than a month after he was shot dead after holding 18 people hostage at Martin Place's Lindt Cafe 

Droudis is in custody after her bail was revoked on December 22, accused of murdering the mother of two of Monis' children, Noleen Hayson Pal in November 2013.

The NSW Attorney General's office explained that the coroner ordered that no details be released due to the upcoming inquest into the siege, according to Nine News.

Innocent civilians Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson were also tragically killed during the hostage crisis  and their deaths will be investigated during the inquest which will commence on January 29.

The aim of the inquest will be to determine how the deaths occurred, the factors that contributed to them and whether they could have been prevented. 

Sydney's head Islamic funeral director has said that no Muslim funeral home will accept the body of Siege gunman Man Haron Monis, suggesting instead that authorities dump his body at sea.

His body lay unclaimed at a morgue for almost a month whilst debate raged regarding the best course-of-action.  

Last month, a funeral director within the Lebanese Muslim Association declared that no Islamic funeral home would accept Monis' body.

When asked about the fate of the 50-year old extremists body, Amin Sayed said 'we don't care about him, we don't know him, chuck him in the bloody sh**house.'

'Nobody's going to do his funeral. No Muslim funeral home will accept him,' he said.

'They can throw him in the bloody sea.'

Mr Sayed had speculated that Monis would receive a secret funeral with an unmarked grave, and that they would not accept any amount of money to arrange his funeral.

'Anyone who does harm to Australians, we don't want him,' he said.  

Last month, a funeral director within the Lebanese Muslim Association declared that no Islamic funeral home would accept Monis' body 

A NSW Health spokesperson told Daily Telegraph 'Local health districts are responsible for the processing and payment of destitute burials and cremations in their district.'

'Where the death of a person has occurred outside of a public health facility, and the police have determined that the state.

'Where the death of a person has occurred outside of a public health facility, and the police have determined that the state is ultimately responsible for their burial, the local health district will fund a funeral.' 

No Muslim can be denied a holy funeral unless they renounce their faith before their death.
