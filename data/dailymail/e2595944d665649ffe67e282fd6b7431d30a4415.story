Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers insists the club's efforts to strengthen over the summer in which they have lost Luis Suarez should not be compared to the case of Tottenham and Gareth Bale from a year ago.

Winger Bale departed Spurs to join Real Madrid for a gargantuan fee and the London outfit splashed out on a raft of new players ahead of the 2013/14 campaign, but many of them subsequently struggled to make an impact.

Forward Suarez followed Bale in making a mega-money switch to Spain by signing for Barcelona in July, by which time Liverpool had already been spending significantly on new players and have continued to do so.

Nothing compares: Brendan Rodgers insists Liverpool have not spent for same reasons as Spurs last season

Big bucks: Gareth Bale and Luis Suarez left the Premier League for Real Madrid and Barcelona respectively

Nine have been recruited by the Reds in the transfer window to date, with the latest being the most high-profile in maverick Italy striker Mario Balotelli.

How it all comes together remains to be seen, but Rodgers, whose side face Tottenham away in the Barclays Premier League on Sunday, is feeling optimistic about his restructured squad.

And asked about his confidence that Liverpool will not suffer the problems Spurs have post-Bale, the Northern Irishman said: 'I think it is totally different circumstances.

'Spurs were a strong squad, had a top, world-class player in Gareth Bale and they will have their reasons for bringing in their players.

'For us, I think it is pretty obvious we were very low in terms of our numbers and that quality and depth.

'So, irrespective of Luis staying or going, it was something we had to do and I'm very glad we did it, because I look at the quality in our training and it has gone up a level.

'I see the hunger that the young players coming into the squad have given and the boost that has given the senior players as well.

'I think it is different circumstances, but obviously over the course of the coming years we will see.'

While Tottenham could only finish sixth last term, Liverpool, who thrashed them 5-0 at White Hart Lane and then 4-0 at Anfield during the campaign, surprised many by comfortably securing a Champions League berth and going close to claiming the Premier League title, eventually coming second.

Back in the European competition for the first time since 2009, the Reds discovered on Thursday that they are set to come up against Bale, having been drawn with defending champions Real in Group B.

Rodgers, who will be in charge of Liverpool for a 100th competitive game on Sunday, is relishing the prospect of taking on the Primera Division giants.

He said: 'It was great on Thursday for the supporters and is great that Liverpool are back in their rightful place in the Champions League.

'They are two clubs that are very special - you are looking at 15-times winners between the two (five times for Liverpool, 10 for Real), which is incredible.

'There is no doubt it felt good on Thursday and must have been great for everyone connected with Liverpool to watch the draw'.

Certainly Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard, who won the Champions League with the club in 2005, was an excited viewer on Thursday.

'It was massive - I planned my whole day around the Champions League draw, I had friends and family round and we had it on the television,' Gerrard told liverpoolfc.com.

'We couldn't wait for it, it was so exciting. I've missed it so much. There's almost a jealousy when you watch the Champions League and you're not involved in it.

'They (Real) were one of the sides that all of the players wanted, and certainly the supporters.

'For us, it's a chance to go and compete against the best.

'We're not in this competition to make the numbers up, we're not celebrating and going out to enjoy this competition - we want to compete and go as far as we can.'
