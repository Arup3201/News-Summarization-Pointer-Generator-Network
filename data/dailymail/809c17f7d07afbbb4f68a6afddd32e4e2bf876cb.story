A suit that can help some disabled people walk again has been approved for home use.

The first-of-a-kind set of robotic leg braces act like an exoskeleton for people paralysed from the waist down, allowing them to stand and walk without assistance.

At the heart of the system are a series of motion sensors attached to leg braces, as well as motorised joints that respond to subtle changes in upper-body movement.

A harness around the wearer’s waist and shoulders keeps the suit in place, and a backpack holds the computer and rechargeable battery. Crutches are used for stability.

The ReWalk exoskeleton, launched two years ago, has already helped countless people walk again, but getting hold of one was always difficult.

The 'robotic trousers' were first cleared for personal use in the UK in 2012 and have been available throughout Europe since that time for around £45,000.

Now the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has given full approval for its use in the U.S - and it will be sold for around $69,500.

As well as the ability to stand and walk independently, clinical studies of ReWalk show health benefits to the user, on both a physiological and psychological level

The device was developed by Amit Goffer, the founder of Israel-based Argo Medical Technologies, who was paralysed following a car crash in 1997.

Radi Kaiof is an Israeli who is trained to use the device. He lost the use of his legs while serving in the Israeli army.

'For me it is amazing, the freedom, to be told I can walk after I thought I could never walk again is brilliant,' he said.

It only took five two-hour sessions for Radi to be completely trained on the system.

Rather than forcing the user into motion the system gives them complete control of the device. From a watch, Radi selects what he wants to do - such as stand, sit, walk and ascend - and then uses his body movement to control it.

After choosing to walk, all he needs to do is lean forward, and to stop he simple leans upright.

As well as the ability to stand and walk independently, clinical studies of ReWalk show health benefits to the user, on both a physiological and psychological level.

According to the company, there are potential improvements in cardiovascular health, loss of fat tissue, building of lean muscle mass, and improved bowel function.  

ReWalk users have said it also helps with better pain management, fewer medications, and reduces hospital visits.

‘ReWalking is much more than walking,' says Jeff Dykan, Argo’s Chairman of the Board.  

'ReWalk provides paralysed individuals with the ability to stand and walk, to look someone in the eye, to hug and be hugged.

‘These are simple acts which many of our ReWalkers thought they would never be able to do again.’

A radical new suit for the firefighter of the future has been revealed that could give them superhuman strength.

The
 exoskeleton would allow firefighters to easily rescue and carry people 
out of fires, or take heavy equipment up flights of stairs inside a 
burning building.

It can be 
fitted with a range of gadgets for different missions, including a high 
pressure water hose that clips onto the arm.

'Each
 year, an estimated 15,500 high-rise structure fires cause 60 civilian 
deaths, 930 injuries, and $252 million in property loss,' said Melbourne
 designer Ken Chen.

'High-rise
 buildings can hold thousands of people well above the reach of fire 
department aerial devices, once the fire is above the operational reach 
of aerial ladder or elevating platforms the chance of rescuing victims 
is near zero.'

To help solve
 the problem, Chen designed a strap on exoskeleton to boost 
firefighter's strength and allow them to easily climb high buildings.

'The
 A.F.A exoskeleton suit aim to increases firefighters’ performance in 
walking, running and carrying while high-rise fire fighting,' he 
explained.

The suit allows firefighters to easily climbs dozens of flights of stairs without exhausting themselves
