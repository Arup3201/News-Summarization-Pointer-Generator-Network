Apple is set to introduce a new set top box that will allow users to download apps to their TV - and play games on it without having to buy a dedicated console.

The box is expected to replace the current $99 Apple TV box, and experts claim it could be released in the first half of 2014.

It is also believed to include similar software to the iPhone and iPad, potentially allowing specially adapted apps to be run on the big screen.

An update to Apple's $99 TV box is expected to bring an app store to the device for the first time.

Rumours of an Apple TV set have been floating around since the death of Steve Jobs.

The Apple co-founder, who died in October 2011, told his biographer, Walter Isaacson, that he had 'cracked' the problem of television, although Isaacson did not reveal the plans as the product has not been launched.

The firm is believed to be preparing a range of large screen TV sets, although has refused to reveal any details about the project.

'We’ve learned that Apple is making progress on its development of a successor to the current Apple TV and that the device is well into testing,' said blog 9to5mac.

It also claims that motion control systems are also being tested, allowing users to change channel by simply waving their arm - but it is unclear whether these will be included in the update or saved for Apple's much-rumoured TV set.

The firm recently spent $280million on an Israeli company called PrimeSense that created the motion sensing technology used in Microsoft's Kinect sensors.

The PrimeSense technology can 'see' objects in 3D and Apple is believed to be wanting to buy the company to add this software to a gesture-controlled system for its TVs.

'Our sources previously indicated that Apple is experimenting with new input methods for TV-related products such as motion controls, but it is unclear if that Kinect-like interface is in the cards for this year’s Apple TV product,' said 9to5mac.

Rumours claim the current box could also receive an update giving it access to the app store, and Apple has been working with developers to streamline the process of developing TV apps.

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who died in October 2011, told his biographer, Walter Isaacson, that he had 'cracked' the problem of television, although Isaacson did not reveal the plans as the product has not been launched.

It is also expected to improve its remote control app that allows an iPaf and iPhone to act as a remote for the TV.
