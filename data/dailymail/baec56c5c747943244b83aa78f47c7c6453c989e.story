David Cameron has written to the mother of a British doctor who died in custody in Syria, describing his death as 'a sickening and appalling tragedy'.

Dr Abbas Khan, 32, was on the verge of being released when his family were told of his death this week.

His relatives have said he was the victim of a political murder, but the Syrian government have called his death suicide.

Transfer: The body of Dr Abbas Khan, who was killed while volunteering in Syria, has been returned to Britain

Heading home: The orthopaedic surgeon's body was handed over to UK officials in Beirut, Lebanon, yesterday

Tragic: Dr Abbas Khan, a father-of-two, died just days before he was due to be released from a Syrian jail

His body was flown back to the UK today and will undergo a post-mortem examination.

In
 a letter dated December 20, the Prime Minister told his mother, Fatima 
Khan, that he and his wife Samantha were 'so very sorry' to hear of her 
son's death.

'I know from my
 own experience of losing a child that words are of little comfort at 
this terrible time but please know that you are in our thoughts,' he 
wrote.

'Abbas' death is a sickening and appalling tragedy and it is right that the Syrian regime should answer for it.

He
 branded the regime's treatment of Dr Khan 'despicable' and claimed it 
was 'utterly unacceptable' that the UK were not able to support him. In a hand-written ending, he added: 'You are in our thoughts and prayers.'

Dr Khan's
 brother Afroze said he was 'grateful' that Mr Cameron had condemned the
 Syrian regime but insisted that the Prime Minister must now 'follow 
through' and use every possible method to bring to justice 'those who 
have murdered my brother'.

Distraught: The 32-year-old's mother Fatima Khan broke down in tears at the sight of her son's coffin yesterday

Anguish: Ms Khan was in the Lebanese capital to meet the coffin which was today transported back to Britain

Allegations: The mother, pictured left with her son Shah Nawaz, insisted Syrian officials had 'killed' Dr Khan

He
 told the BBC: 'We are very angry at the failures of the British 
government at securing the release of my brother and now that he is dead
 we want to see the British government act decisively to respond to the 
death of a British citizen at the hands of a foreign regime.'

Mr Khan added: 'There must be a firm response to such a callous and cruel act.'

The
 orthopaedic surgeon from London was captured in November 2012 in the 
ancient city of Aleppo after travelling from Turkey to help victims of 
hospital bombings.

Horrific: Dr Khan was captured in November last year - just 48 hours after flying from Turkey to Aleppo to help victims of hospital bombings

Dispute: Syrian regime officials claim the orthopaedic surgeon hanged himself while in captivity - a suggestion that has been refuted by his family, who say he was looking forward to spending Christmas at home

Nabeel
 Sheikh, solicitor for Dr Khan's family, issued a statement which read: 
'Dr Khan's family would like to thank everyone for their help and 
support.

'The family are relieved that his body has been repatriated. Dr 
Khan is being transported by ambulance to the Coroner's Court in 
Walthamstow for the purposes of a post-mortem.

'The
 family hopes that all relevant tests as deemed necessary are carried 
out so as to ensure the post-mortem is concluded without delay and the 
body laid to rest as soon as possible.

Support: In a letter dated December 7, Dr Khan told his campaigners 'Good work guys - keep up the pressure'

'The
 Home Office is organising the process but, as a matter of course, 
Scotland Yard is actively involved given the circumstances surrounding 
Dr Khan's death are highly suspicious.

'Our
 thoughts are with the family. The immediate priority is to give the 
family privacy and enough support as necessary to help them through this
 difficult time.'

The 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it transported the 
body from Damascus to the Lebanese capital Beirut, where it was received
 by Mrs Khan and British officials.

Mrs Khan, who has '110%' refuted claims that he committed suicide, broke down in tears when the coffin arrived.

'The national security intelligence of Syria, they killed him!' she screamed. 'They're murderers!'

Mrs Khan has categorically denied claims made by Syria's deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad that he had killed himself.

In
 the last few days the family revealed a letter in which the doctor 
expressed his optimism at being released, and his hopes of being home in
 time for Christmas.

Dear Mrs Khan,

Samantha and I were so very sorry to hear about the tragic death of your son, Abbas, in Syria. I know from my own experience of losing a child that words are of little comfort at this terrible time but please know that you are in our thoughts. I hope that, in time, you will remember all the good things about Abbas' life.

You have shown incredible courage and fortitude throughout the last 13 months. I cannot begin to imagine how devastating losing Abbas must be, especially at a time when it seemed as if the regime might finally release him. I hope that you can draw some comfort from the out pouring of support you have received, and that you have the space and time to grieve for him, as well as celebrate, with pride, the fact that he dedicated so much of his life helping others, including some of the most vulnerable people in the world.

The Foreign Secretary has been briefed regularly on Abbas' case and I have asked the Foreign Office to do all they can to bring Abbas' body home as soon as possible.

Abbas' death is a sickening and appalling tragedy and it is right that the Syrian regime should answer for it. Their despicable treatment of him and refusal to engage with us or the Czechs to enable us to support him is utterly unacceptable. We will continue to press for those responsible to be held to account.

Again, please accept my deepest condolences. Our thoughts are with you.

(Handwritten) You are in our thoughts and prayers.

Yours sincerely,

David Cameron
