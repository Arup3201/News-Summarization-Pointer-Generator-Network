Warning: Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has warned there could already be as many as 200 return jihadis in London

There could already be as many as 200 returned jihadis in London alone, Britain’s most senior policeman has warned.

Speaking yesterday, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe also added his voice to those calling for terrorists who go abroad to fight to be stripped of their UK passports.

And he called for the return of the controversial control orders which were used to tightly restrict the movement and behaviour of terror suspects.

The orders were replaced in 2011 by less restrictive measures, but with more than 500 Britons said to be fighting for Islamic State and other militant groups in Syria and Iraq – and 250 said to have returned to the UK – Sir Bernard said the ‘drum beat has changed’.

Speaking on LBC radio, he said: ‘Certainly for us anything that either stops them from going or preferably stops them from coming back is a good idea.

‘If it works, we should do that. It seems to me it’s a privilege to have a passport and be a citizen of this country, and if you’re going to start fighting in another country on behalf of another state, or against another state, it seems to me that you’ve made a choice about where you what to be.’

And he warned the real number of ‘militarised’ jihadi fighters back in the country could exceed the official estimate of 250.

UK militants have adopted an increasingly high profile in Syria, posting sickening pictures of corpses and beheadings on social media.

The murderer of US journalist James Foley, 40, who was beheaded as part of an IS video, is thought by voice experts to be from London or the south-east.

Sir Bernard said the force is working with American counterparts to firmly establish whether the murderer is British.

Calling for a return of ‘something like’ the abolished control orders – which enabled the authorities to tell terror suspects where to live and place them under lengthy curfews – he added: ‘They were stopped because the threat was reduced and quite properly they were seen as too intrusive.

‘But I think these things have got to be considered when the drum beat changes, and it’s clear that the drum beat has changed.’

Earlier this week Boris Johnson said those who ‘continue to give allegiance to a terrorist state’ should lose their British citizenship, and the law should be changed so there is a ‘rebuttable presumption’ that those visiting war areas without notifying the authorities had done so for a terrorist purpose.

Sir Bernard – who also said that there had been ‘too much sensitivity’ over tackling hate preachers on the streets of Britain – added: ‘The big thing for us, that we have talked about, is if we can get an assumption that when people come back and they have been to Syria, they have been involved in terrorism – if they can prove they haven’t then it’s up to them.’
