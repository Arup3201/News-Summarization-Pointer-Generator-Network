We've had jeans that squeeze your tummy in, others that make your legs look longer - and now Wrangler is to launch denim that tackles cellulite.

The US jeans brand's 'Smooth Legs' skinny jeans from the new Denim Spa range are made from fabric treated with orange peel-busting ingredients such as caffeine, retinol and algae extract.

But in a bizarre twist, Wrangler have hired the super-skinny Lizzie Jagger to model the range.

So does that mean the brand are worried the cellulite-busting jeans just don't work?

Although thin Lizzie probably doesn't have much cellulite to worry about, Wrangler say that clinical 
tests showed that 69 per cent of those trialling the jeans reported an improvement in the appearance of their thighs.

Testers at the Institut Adriant in France wore the jeans for eight hours a day, five days a week during the six-week testing period.

Other options in the Denim Spa range, due to go on sale at ASOS.com at the end of the month, include pairs infused with moisturising olive oil extract and soothing aloe vera.

But don't throw your body moisturiser away just yet: the interior coating only lasts for 15 wears or between four and six washes.

Annoying though that might be, Wrangler has also created a 'reload spray' to use after each wash, which should extend the beauty benefits for up to 95 wears.

After that, you'll be left with plain old denim, although they should still look good with your favourite jumper.

The jeans, which start at Â£85 per pair, come in the skinny 'Courtney', 'Molly' and 'Corynn' styles, and will go on sale on the 28th January.
