Hull are making an improved bid for Blackburn striker Jordan Rhodes by offering £10million for the Scotland international.

Blackburn rejected Hull's opening offer of £8m plus add ons as they value the striker at £14m.

Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer confirmed Hull's interest in the 24-year-old, who signed a new contract in July.

Striker: Hull City have made a bid for Blackburn and Scotland forward Jordan Rhodes

Bowyer is working with a squad of 22 players with three of them goalkeepers and will struggle without a player who has scored 53 goals in 99 games.

Hull need a striker and one of their other targets Lorient's Vincent Aboubakar is poised to join Porto who are in talks to sell Jackson Martinez to AC Milan.

Blackburn's owners are considering bids for the 24-year-old Scotland international, who signed a new long-term contract at Ewood Park in July.

Rovers paid Huddersfield a club-record fee of £8m for Rhodes in 2012 and he has since scored 53 goals in 99 games.

Bowyer said: 'There has been an enquiry which has been taken to the board and the owners. That's as much as I know.' 

Steve Bruce is in need of another striker after selling Shane Long to Southampton and has been rebuffed by Manchester United's Danny Welbeck while also considering Watford's Troy Deeney, Vincent Aboubakar of Lorient and Steven Fletcher at Sunderland.

Rhodes has scored 52 goals in 90 games for Blackburn since joining from Huddersfield for £8million.

Bruce was dealt a blow on Wednesday after his £7million summer signing Robert Snodgrass was sidelined for six months after dislocating his knee cap.

In addition, Alex Bruce is ruled out with a back injury and, following the sale of Shane Long to Southampton last week, Bruce is fully aware of the need to act before the transfer window slams shut.
