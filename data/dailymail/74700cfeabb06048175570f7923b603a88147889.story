With his sportswear, earring and back-turned baseball cap, you wouldn't think he was a fan of classical music - let alone a talented opera singer.

But Maxwell Thorpe is proof that you should never judge a book by its cover.

Because the shy 23-year-old, known as 'Chavarotti', has won hundreds of fans performing tear-jerking renditions of opera classics such as Nessun Dorma and Halleluja.

Unlikely: Maxwell Thorpe, 23, sings on the streets of Chesterfield with his dog, Humphry

Performance: Maxwell likes to sing classics such as Nessun Dorma and Halleluja

And rather than performing in concert halls, Maxwell prefers a more down-to-earth venue - a bustling town centre.

Maxwell, who is always accompanied by his loyal dog Humphry, a Shar-Pei Staffordshire terrier cross, sings outside a shopping centre in Chesterfield, Derbyshire.

On busy days, up to a hundred people gather to listen to his amazing voice.

He has also become and internet sensation, with one clip of him singing on YouTube receiving almost 100,000 hits.

Humble Maxwell, from Sheffield, admits that people are often surprised by his unlikely talent.

He said: 'People stop and ask me: "where does that voice come from?"' 

Humble: The singer, pictured at his usual performance spot, says he just wants to share his gift with the world

Popular: Sometimes up to a hundred people stop to listen to Maxwell sing

'I know it’s a gift and 
something I have to share with people.

'I was lost for a bit and then I 
came out on the streets and it’s been great.'

As for his 'Chavarotti' nickname, Maxwell, who calls his style of singing 'Hip-Opera', said:

Out of the limelight: Maxwell has no plans to enter any talent competitions such as Britain's Got Talent

'A guy took a video of me in Doncaster - he called it Chavarotti.

'It is very funny, it is a pun.

The guy was sincere. There wasn't any harm meant by it.'

Despite his growing popularity, Maxwell has no plans to audition for X Factor or Britain's Got Talent.

He said: 'I would like to show a different way to life.

'I know that there are people who go on the shows who do have real talent - but I don’t feel that’s the way for me.

'I want to bring a whole, rounded performance - a more philosophical performance.'

Maxwell says he is not interested in being on TV, like many aspiring musicians, and instead wants his singing career to grow 'organically'.

He added: 'I can only improve and the more I improve the more people will see the beauty of the voice.

'It’s a gift, I can’t take any accolade from it.'

The amateur singer also performs reggae and hip-hop.

But he seems to have found his hit niche with opera, and following some timeout in early 2013, plans to take his talent to more market towns across the north of Britain.
