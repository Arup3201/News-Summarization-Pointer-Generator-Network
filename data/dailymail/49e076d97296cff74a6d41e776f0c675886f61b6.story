Australians are claiming to take more sexual partners over a lifetime than a decade ago, with researchers pointing towards a liberal approach to sleeping with people. 

Compared to a decade ago, people have become more open to premarital sex, abortion and homosexuality, liberating couples to engage in a varied sex life. 

Researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), La Trobe University and the University of Sydney have published a study which reveals that women claim to have taken nine sexual partners in their lifetime, and men claim to have taken 17.5.

Around 20,000 people aged between 16 and 69 participated in the researcher, revealing statistics that are higher than numbers from a decade ago.

The last report indicated that women took 7 partners over a lifetime, and men took 16.5 partners over a lifetime. 

'It might be that there's a more liberal approach to actually having more partners,' said Dr Chris Rissel, public health researcher at the University of Sydney told The Sydney Morning Herald.

'The unacceptability of women being promiscuous is slipping away.'

The study indicated that women are also more likely to have had sex for the first time during their early teens, with 16% of women reporting that they had lost their virginity before 16, up from 13% a decade ago.

However, less men reported engaging in sex before the age of 16, down from 22% a decade ago to 19%. 

Research also revealed that on average Australians were having sex approximately 1.4 times a week, less than 0.4 times than Australians a decade ago.

The younger they were, the more sex they were having but even people in their 60s admitted to engaging in the practice at least once a week.

Professor Juliet Richters, lead researcher from UNSW, said that the frequency of sex among those surveyed came as a shock.

'We thought it was a mistake, but a recent British national survey had the same finding,' Professor Richters told The Age. 

With technology taking over our daily routine, Professor Richters suggests the time spent online could be impacting our sex lives.

'I would have thought take a mobile phone to bed might have something to do with it', she said.

Even though people these days are having less sex, nearly 90 per cent of men and 75 per cent of women admit that they are very much enjoying their sexual encounters.

The country's largest study of sexual activity and attitudes  found that over 92 per cent of heterosexual people are having vaginal sex, 86 per cent of men and 80 per cent of women are engaging in oral sex and 25 per cent of men and 19 per cent of women have had anal sex.

Oral and anal sex was more common among 30 to 49 year-olds. 

'We're entering a more exploratory, diverse time,' said Dr Chris Rissel.

'I think what we've probably got is a less dramatic change than the 1960s but across a wider range of the population. We've got more exploration, more diversity, across a wider age group.'

Nearly half of the people under 60 also admitted to watching pornography compared to a decade ago. 

Despite this, around 95 per cent of people demand exclusivity in their relationship, The Australian Study of Health and Reproduction revealed.
