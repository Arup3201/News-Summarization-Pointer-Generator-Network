Ashley Cole helped Roma make it two wins out of two and go top of Serie A with a 1-0 win at newly-promoted Empoli on Saturday.

Radja Nainggolan, who scored in Roma's opening 2-0 victory over Fiorentina before the international break, forced an own goal from Empoli goalkeeper Luigi Sepe. 

The Belgium international's fierce strike on the stroke of halftime came off the left upright and went in off Sepe's back.

Maicon hit the upright moments earlier. 

Both sides had penalty appeals turned down in a hotly contested match which saw Empoli coach Maurizio Sarri sent to the stands for protesting.

Empoli has lost both of its opening matches, following its 2-0 defeat at Udinese. 

Roma rested the likes of captain Francesco Totti and pacey strikers Gervinho and Juan Iturbe, ahead of Champions League home match against CSKA Moscow on Wednesday.

It almost took the lead in the 11th minute but Sepe did well to parry Alessandro Florenzi's volley.

Maicon, who was sent home from the Brazil squad for disciplinary reasons during the week, should have scored four minutes from halftime when Florenzi nodded across Nainggolan's diagonal pass, but he fired onto the right upright from close range under pressure.

Roma appealed furiously for handball as Miralem Pjanic's follow-up appeared to strike Lorenzo Tonelli's arm.

The capital side did take the lead minutes later thanks to the impressive Nainggolan.

Roma could have doubled its advantage in the 57th minute following a give and go between Florenzi and Maicon, but the Brazilian's shot was straight at Sepe.

Empoli could also have had a penalty in the 72nd for a clumsy Kostas Manolas challenge on Levan Mchedlidze. However, the referee waved away their appeals and sent Sarri to the stands for dissent.

Shortly afterwards, Mchedlidze threatened again with a fierce shot which Roma goalkeeper Morgan De Sanctis parried.
