They're both known for their big personalities, while they've both struggled to maintain longlasting relationships.

So it could be that Russell Brand has finally met his match now that he has reportedly started dating Spice Girls star Geri Halliwell.

It has emerged today (Tuesday) that the funnyman and pop star started dating after hitting it off at the Olympics Closing Ceremony earlier this month.

New couple! Geri Halliwell has reportedly started dating Russell Brand after hitting it off with him at the Olympics Closing Ceremony earlier this month

Hitting it off: Russell admitted he had a crush on Halliwell after posing for this photo with the Spice Girls backstage at the Olympics

And Brand was so taken with the Spice Girl he reportedly dumped his girlfriend Isabella Brewster for her.

Russell, 37, and Geri, 40, have been spotted on several dates together since hooking up at the sporting extravaganza, where they both performed during the night.

Last weekend they were seen taking in the sights of Hampton Court Palace, even with Halliwell's daughter Bluebell in tow.

A source told The Sun: 'Things are getting very serious between them — they’re a proper couple now. They had met several times in the past, but really got to know each other during the Olympics.'

Brand was so smitten when he met up with Geri at the Olympics, he gushed: 'I’ve got a crush on Geri Halliwell — everything in the world is how it should be.'

And it seems she felt the same way.

The pair have since been spotted on 'a romantic date on Hamstead Heath days after the Olympics' with fans on twitter spotting the odd couple.

One fan wrote: 'Just jogged past a very tall Russell Brand and a very short Geri Halliwell.'

The pair posed up together, along with the rest of the Spice Girls, for a Twitter photo shared by Melanie Brown at the event.

And Brand was noticeably snuggled up close to Geri in the group shot.

They first met back in 2007 but now it has been claimed they have started up a relationship, despite Russell seeming loved up with American Isabella up until recently.

Moving on: Russell divorced Katy Perry earlier this year, while he reportedly dumped American girlfriend Isaballa Brewster for the pop star a few weeks ago

It's not the first time Russell has sparked up a relationship with a high profile name after a big showbiz event.

He met wife Katy Perry at the MTV Video Music Awards.

They went on to wed a year later but he has been nursing a broken heart since they split over Christmas, attempting to move on with Brewster, who he was reportedly set to move in with until meeting Geri.

A representative for Brand has been contacted by the Mail Online for comment.

A source close to Geri brushed off the reports and told the MailOnline: 'They're just friends and have been out a few times, there's not much else to add at this stage.'
