The pair of star-crossed lovers have been having a relationship in secret for three or four months and investigators believe that they left willingly. 

Their concerned relatives believe that they had previously broken up following a rocky relationship, but reconciled and fled together. 

According to Local 10, the pair's love was forbidden because Escalante has a criminal record including assault and battery convictions. 

Atone point he is also said to have threatened to kill her if he saw her dating anyone else/  

The families of both Samantha and Fabio were present at the press conference, putting aside tensions between them in a bid to get them to come home. 

They used to be friends, however they are believed to have not spoken in a number of years following a row.  

Daneya Delgado, the teen's cousin, told reporters they were not going to press charges in the case and just want her to safe. 

Investigators from the organization Bring Them Home believe the pair have fled willingly because of tensions between their families 

Despite their differences, the families of both Samantha and her boyfriend attended a press conference in a desperate bid for them to return 

'She's welcome to come home together, if they're a couple or they're just friends, to come, 'cause their parents are worried. Both my uncles and their parents are worried,' she said.

Yamile Palenzuela, Samantha's mother, said: 'I know she is doing well and whereever she is I know he is not going to hurt her. He is not a bad boy.'

Escalanate's mother Lulay Oliveros, added: 'Please, please come back, nothing bad is going to happen.'

Private investigator Joe Carillo who has set up a search added: 'What we believe is that they're together, that she is OK, and they're scared, and we just want them to come back.'

At first, Samantha's father, Daniel Delgado, feared he had kidnapped her, but now he know she ran away. He has known Escalante ince he was 14-years-old. 

Delgado said he wanted him to know that he has no intentions of filing charges against him. 

In a public statement, police said Delgado is with Escalante. He is wanted for interference in the custody of a minor.

Yamile Palenzuela, Samantha's mother, said: 'I know she is doing well and whereever she is I know he is not going to hurt her. He is not a bad boy'
