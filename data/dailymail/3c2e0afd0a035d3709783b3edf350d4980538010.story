A 15-year-old boy who killed himself and two innocent men in a wrong-way car crash had written a suicide note on his arm, police sources have said.

Srijan Saha took his parents' 1995 Honda Civic without permission early on Tuesday and drove the wrong way on Route 27 North in Edison, New Jersey, striking a 2011 Nissan Altima head-on.

The high-speed smash killed Saha and the other car's occupants, 46-year-old Mohammed Zia and 36-year-old Ali Behzad, who had gone out to pick up coffee just a few blocks from their home.

While police and friends have not 
indicated why Saha wanted to kill himself, law enforcement sources told 
the New Jersey Star-Ledger he had written a note on his arm, but did not reveal what it said.

Acting Middlesex Prosecutor Andrew Carey has confirmed that the crash is being investigated as a 'suicide-homicide'.

Witnesses said the Honda had veered into oncoming traffic and collided with the car driven by Zia. Saha and Behzad were pronounced dead at the scene, and Zia died at hospital a short time later.

The two men, who were brothers-in-law and who each had three children, were just a block from their homes when they were killed.

'They went to go get coffee, and after 
that they just never came back,' nephew Moazzam Zia told CBS2 as he visited the crash site on Tuesday.

'I'm 
holding myself up right now. God took the biggest part of our family away today... two of them at once.'

Saha, who loved rap music and luxury cars according to his Facebook page, was remembered with a moment of silence in classrooms at John P. Stevens High School in Edison on Wednesday.

Friends remembered Saha, a sophomore at the high school, as a talented artist.

'The district's prayers are with the late student's family, friends, students, staff, and community, during this very difficult time of extreme sorrow and grief,' the schoolâ€™s superintendent, Richard O'Malley, told the Star-Ledger.

'The police investigation is active and continuing and at this time we ask everyone to continue to keep those killed in this tragic incident and their families in their thoughts and prayers.'

In a letter, the principal asked parents to monitor their children's social networking to make sure they were not struggling to deal with the student's death.

Edison Mayor Antonia Ricigliano added: 'It's such a sad and tragic situation. It's beyond belief.'
