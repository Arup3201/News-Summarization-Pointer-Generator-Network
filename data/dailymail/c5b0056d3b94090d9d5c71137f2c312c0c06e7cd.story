Shock: Theresa Hunt was shot dead by Richard Plotts in a Philadelphia hospital on Thursday after an argument broke out and a gun battle ensued

The distraught family of 53-year-old Theresa Hunt, the tragic mental-health caseworker shot dead by a psychiatric patient inside a Philadelphia hospital on Thursday, have vented their fury at her killer.

Her sister, Martha Trinca, took to Facebook to label Richard Plotts -Â  who was critically wounded by hero Dr. Lee Silverman when he returned fire - a 'SOB' who 'needs to rot in hell forever'.

The caseworker's devastated brother, Dennis Hunt, said that he was 'angry' at Plotts, 49, for taking Theresa's life, telling reporters that the youngest of nine children was known by her siblings as 'Mother Theresa' for her compassion.

Writing on Facebook about her awful loss, Martha Trinca said that her sister was her 'best friend' and 'I'm glad I told her every time we talked how much I love her!! I will cherish our time together for the rest of my life!!'

Her clearly emotional brother, Dennis, struggled to get through his interview with ABC 6 and said he wants to ask Plotts why he kiled his little sister.

'I want people to remember my sister as someone who was strong and stands up for what she believes in and good hearted... I don't know what to say,' said Dennis to ABC 6.

'I think that doctor who actually was armed, I think was incredible, what he did.'

The hospital horror unfolded on Thursday afternoon when patient Plotts arrived at the Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital with Hunt where they met Dr. Silverman in an office at the psychiatric unit on the third floor of the hospital.

Once inside, the calamitious series of events began with a heated argument that ended with Hunt being fatally shot in the head, Dr. Silverman also suffering a hit to the head and Plotts critically wounded after two gunshot wounds to the torso and one to his arm.

It was Dr. Silverman's quick reaction that saved lives and police have hailed him as a hero for stopping Plotts before he could embark on a gun rampage.

Yeadon Police Chief Donald Molineux said that 'without a doubt, I believe the doctor saved lives.'

'Without
 that firearm, this guy (the patient) could have went out in the hallway
 and just walked down the offices until he ran out of ammunition,' the 
chief said.

Whelan identified the caseworker killed Thursday afternoon at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital as Theresa Hunt, 53.

Hunt, who was from Philadelphia, had accompanied Plotts to an appointment with Silverman at a psychiatric crisis center adjacent to the hospital in Darby, just southwest of Philadelphia, authorities said.

'When the caseworker was shot, (Silverman) crouched down behind the desk to avoid him being shot,' Whelan said.

'He was able to reach for his weapon, and realizing it was a life or death situation, was able to engage the defendant in the exchange of gunfire.'

A struggle ensued and spilled out into the hallway, Whelan said. Another doctor and a caseworker jumped in to help Silverman and secure Plotts' weapon, he said.

The motive for the shooting remained unclear late Thursday, although Whelan said Plotts, of Upper Darby, might have had issues with the doctor over his treatment plan.

However, it's unclear if that's why Silverman was armed, apparently against hospital policy.

'We do believe that there were some issues between the doctor and the patient, but whether or not he actually feared him is unclear,' the prosecutor said.

'From all accounts, (he) would have acted in self-defense.'

Whelan said that Plotts, 49, was still in surgery Thursday evening at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, while Silverman had been treated and released.

Telephone calls to the doctor's home went unanswered.

Fatal shooting: Several victims were reported after shots were fired at the Darby Borough hospital and at least one victim has died

Suspect: Shots broke out around 2pm but by 3pm reports from the scene indicated the suspected shooter was in custody

Plotts does not have a listed home phone number. Court records in Delaware County show a man of the same name and age with a lengthy criminal record, but Whelan was uncertain if they were the same person.

The hospital has a policy barring anyone except on-duty law enforcement officers from carrying weapons on its campus, a spokeswoman for the Mercy Health System said.

But Molineux insisted Silverman was a hero who saved lives.

Two guns were recovered from the scene, Whelan said.

Staff members had heard loud arguing inside Silverman's office during the appointment.

They opened the door and noticed the patient had a gun pointed at the doctor, so they quietly closed the door and dialed 911, Whelan said. Gunshots were heard a short time later, just before 2:30 p.m.

Plotts, severely wounded from several shots, emerged from the office, and another doctor and a caseworker helped wrestle him to the floor of the hallway and grabbed his weapon, Whelan said.

'They acted vigilantly. They acted bravely,' he said.

The exchange of gunfire occurred on the third floor of the Wellness Center at Mercy Fitzgerald, a 204-bed community teaching hospital. Authorities said there are no surveillance cameras in the doctor's office or the waiting area outside.

They also said the center had no metal detectors.

Patients waiting in the first-floor lobby reported a tense scene when police arrived and ordered everyone out. Most of the patients were elderly.

'I dozed off, and I heard the cop shouting, "Come on, come on, get out!"' said Millicent Russell, of Lansdowne, who was waiting for a 3 p.m. appointment.

'There were people with walkers and canes and stuff. All these cops were outside running here and there with these guns.'
