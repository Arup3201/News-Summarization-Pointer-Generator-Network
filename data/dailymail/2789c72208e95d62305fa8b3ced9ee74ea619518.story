A recession-hit businessman who threw himself from a canal bridge was found with a note saying: 'No work, no money, no pension, no future,' an inquest has heard. 

Married father-of-two Raymond Hollingsworth had celebrated his 60th birthday only days before a dog walker found his body hanging from a bridge, the coroner was told.

The keen gardener had taken out business loans and credit cards without telling his wife of 42 years after discovering his private pension scheme was not going to mature as planned.

The self-employed businessman's body was discovered hanging over Basingstoke Canal by father-of-three Philip Hinsley while he was out for a morning walk with his dog on November 27 last year, North East Hampshire coroner Andrew Bradley heard. 

Mr Hollingsworth's distraught wife Linda, who chose not to attend the hearing, told police her husband was a family man who had shown no signs of being unhappy.

The couple lived with their son Mark, 24, and their daughter, Ria, 27, is married and lives in Cambridge. 

Mr Hollingsworth also ran his own business as a window cleaner, working in Harrow, north-west London. 

A statement by Mrs Hollingsworth, 57, was read out during the hearing which described her husband as a keen gardener who would go running three of four times a week, running seven to eight miles. 

'At weekends we would often go to visit our daughter in Cambridge or she would visit us,' she said.

On November 20, Mr Hollingsworth had celebrated his 60th birthday. 

'In the lead up to his birthday he was a bit upset, saying he didn't want to be 60,' said Mrs Hollingsworth.

The couple were joined by family and friends for a celebration meal on November 24 which they had enjoyed, she added in her statement.

The night before Mr Hollingsworth's body was found, the couple had been at home and watched television together.

'Nothing that evening was any different from any other night,' his wife added.

The following morning she believed her husband had gone to work and only learned this was not the case when the police visited the family home in Fleet, Hampshire, after Mr Hollingsworth's body was found.

Mrs Hollingsworth told officers: 'Raymond was a very proud man who struggled to talk about himself or his problems but was very good at talking to people if they had problems.

'He loved his family and time spent with them.

Mr Hollingsworth learned about four years before his death that a private pension he had set up in around 1989 or 1990 would not pay out as planned, his wife said.

Since his death she had discovered he had taken out a number of loans and credit cards, including two business loans with Barclays which she did not know about.

'I think if we had discussed it we could have sorted it out but throughout our marriage Raymond had dealt with the finances and I never interfered,' she said.

Mr Hollingsworth had shown no signs of being depressed in the days ahead of his death, according to Mrs Hollingsworth.

She added: 'We didn't argue and were a loving, caring family.'

Dog walker Mr Hinsley said he had been out for a 25-minute stroll after leaving his home in nearby Crookham Road when he discovered Mr Hollingsworth's body. 

Giving evidence, Police Constable Kevan Wright said Mr Hollingsworth's body was discovered hanging from a metal fence running across the bridge.

'There was no sign of any struggle or foul play,' he told the court.

Officers searching the pockets of Mr Hollingsworth's quilted black anorak and light-blue jeans discovered his keys and a passport.

PC Wright told the coroner: 'Inside the passport there was a note saying "no work, no money, no pension, no future".'

The note had been signed by Mr Hollingsworth, he added.

Pathologist Dr Chris Smith carried out a post-mortem examination on Mr Hollingsworth's body.

Coroner Mr Bradley recorded a verdict of suicide.

Earlier this week, mental health charity SANE reported the damaging effects of the recession were blamed for the significant increase in the number of middle-aged men committing suicide.

Latest figures revealed the suicide rate among men aged between 45 and 59 years old increased between 2007 and 2011 by 8.5 per cent to 22.2 deaths per 100,000 people - the highest level for a generation.

Overall UK suicides hit 6,045 in 2011, according to the figures released by the Office for National Statistics, with deaths among men accounting for a majority of more than 4,550.
