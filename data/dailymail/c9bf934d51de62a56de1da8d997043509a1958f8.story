Charles motioned to a delegation that Obama then greeted with the words 'Good to see you'.

The president also met a group of children who were gathered behind the rope line.

Earlier today, Prince Charles visited the Royal Navy's latest destroyer, HMS Duncan, which is docked in Cardiff as part of the summit.

Huge crowds gathered to see the prince, who is Admiral of the Fleet, as he boarded the £1billion Royal Navy T45 vessel, the latest destroyer in its fleet.

During his tour, he inspected a dining room, where Nato defence ministers are having a working dinner this evening, and a hi-tech control room accompanied by commanding officers.

He presented Chief Petty Officer Engineering Technician (Weapon Engineering) Wayne Peake with a long service and good conduct medal.

CPO Peake, who joined the Navy in 1984, at the age of 17, was involved in Operation Desert Storm while serving on HMS Gloucester in 1991, as well as the liberation of Kuwait.

'It has been an absolutely brilliant career so far, a real eye-opener. Being presented with this medal by the Admiral of the Fleet is a pinnacle,' the father-of-two told Wales Online.

As well as meeting the officers and crew, the senior royal also greeted staff from several other warships, currently docked in Roath Basin - including the French anti-submarine destroyer La Motte-Picquet.

HMS Duncan joined the M-05 Viesturs ship from Latvia, a minehunter, which was already docked at the site.

They are set to be joined by the Dutch minesweeper HNLMS Urk, a missile patrol boat in camouflage colours called HNoMS Skudd from Norway, and German-built minesweeper LNS Kursis from Lithuania.

In addition, the Royal Navy's HMS Biter patrol boat and HMS Express fast patrol boat will be part of the contingent

After his visit, Prince Charles briefly spoke to some of the crowd, who had been kept entertained by Her Majesty's Band of the Royal Marines.

Tonight, he is hosting a reception for 60 world leaders on the first evening of the 2014 Nato Summit at the Celtic Manor Resort in Newport.

The summit is being dominated by the situation in Iraq, as well as the stand-off with Russia over Ukraine.

There are 9,500 police officers from 43 forces involved in the security operation for the event, along with 12 miles of security fencing.

In response to the Ukraine crisis, the US has vowed to contribute troops and equipment to a rapid response force in Eastern Europe that would be able to deploy within 48 hours.

Nato has already stepped up its air, land and sea rotations in the region.

And Mr Obama announced last night that he would send more Air Force units and aircraft to the Baltics, most likely to Estonia's Amari Air Base.

The alliance is also planning to establish forward operating bases in eastern Europe where fuel, ammunition and other supplies can by stockpiled ready for use in operations.

Barack Obama and David Cameron speak before taking their seats at the start of a Nato-Afghanistan round table meeting during the summit at the Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, Wales today

With Britain and the US two of only four member states to meet the alliance's obligation to spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence, Prime Minister David Cameron and Mr Obama will be pressing other leaders to raise their spending on their armed forces.

The US president had some harsh words for European members who had failed to deliver on their commitments in the past.

'For I think a certain period of time there was a complacency here in Europe about the demands that were required to make sure that Nato was able to function effectively,' he said.

'Obviously what's happened in Ukraine is tragic, but I do think it gives us an opportunity to look with fresh eyes and understand what it is that's necessary to make sure that our Nato commitments are met.'

Mr Cameron and Mr Obama will hold talks tomorrow with president Poroshenko - together with Mr Hollande, German chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi - ahead of the main summit meeting.

Leaders hold a meeting on Afghanistan during the Nato 2014 summit today. It has been billed as the most important summit since the Cold War got underway with calls to stand up to Russia over Ukraine and confront Islamic State extremists
