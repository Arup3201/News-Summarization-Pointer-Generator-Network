You might be fooled by tricks of the eye, but how about tricks of the ear?

While it’s easy to mishear sounds when first heard, these auditory illusions are persistently misleading.

For instance, the Shepard tone, also known as a ‘sonic barber's pole', seems to continually rise or fall in pitch.

AUDIO: The Shephard Tone

It the audio version of the Penrose stairs optical illusion which depicts a ‘continuous staircase’ in which the stairs make four 90-degree turns as they ascend or descend.

The sound of the Shepard tone is, in reality, a cycling between a limited set of tones, each separated by an octave, according to The Atlantic.

Each tone in the scale is made up of several notes played simultaneously, and at each moment different notes in the tone are played at different volumes.

The trick involves not only which tones are played, but also the volume of the individual notes in the tones.

Changes in volume cause the listener to focus on certain notes while ignoring the others. The illusion works because each tone seems to sounds lower than the preceding.

The listener judges subtle changes in tone by comparing it to the preceding note, not to tones from twenty or thirty seconds ago.

A similar audio illusion, featured on Meara O’Reilly’s Tumblr and discovered by Diana Deutsch, reveals how the human brain tends to automatically group similar notes together.

This audio must be listened through stereo headphones, or stereo separated loudspeakers.

In the illusion two major scales are played with one ascending and the other descending.

On its own, neither melody gives the impression of an ascending or descending pattern.

But when the two melodies are played together most people hear this combination as being two scales that either ascend or descend in unison together.

This is because the brain reassigns some of the notes to a different ear in order to make a coherent melody.

People perceive these sounds differently, but the most commonly they group the high and low notes together.

Right-handed people tend to hear the high melody in the right ear, and the low one in the left, while left-handers have a varied response.

In Meara O’Reilly’s blog, a number of other audio illusion are highlighted including The Wessel illusion.

This demonstrates how tone can determine the way in which we perceptually group notes in a melody.

Three notes, alternating in tone, are played slowly and most people hear a sequence that is rising in pitch.

When this sequence is repeated faster, it’s no longer possible to hear the trajectory of the melody change.

'At a certain point we are forced to perceptually cut our losses—we begin to group the notes solely based on their timbre,' said Ms O'Reily.

The Wessel illusion was discovered by David Wessel of U.C. Berkeley’s Centre for New Music and Audio Technologies.

When played together, the scales either ascend or descend, but on their own, neither melody gives this impression
