These are the incredible photographs of lightning strikes, tornadoes and supercells taken by a storm chaser who still gets frightened during extreme weather.

Chris Allington, 26, from Crofton, Nebraska, braves the elements and drives many miles in pursuit of the most dramatic storms.

The resulting images show lightning bolts darting out of 
the clouds, bathing the sky in an incredible warm glow of orange and 
pink, and giant clouds looming across the sky to form UFO-like weather structures.

Stunning: This photograph, titled 'Dodge', captures the moment a sunset illuminates a sudden lightning bolt - creating an orange rainbow. 'This is my favourite image', Allington said. 'We had been chasing an intense line of thunderstorms... and as sunset approached we decided to let a weakening storm overtake us'

'Nothing is more fascinating to me than 
photographing the displays in the sky that Mother Nature puts on... 
Standing with these warm, moist winds at your back flowing towards a 
beautiful storm is unique and exhilarating,' he said.

'There are often constant rumbles of thunder from high in the clouds, punctuated by louder bursts from close, vibrant lightning strikes,' he added.

Allington said there are still occasions when he gets frightened while chasing a storm, with lightning scaring him the most 'just because it is so random and can happen anywhere without warning'.Â 

Despite his fear however, the storm chaser insists that most of the time he is 'simply mesmerized by the display that's going on in the sky in front of me'.

Growing up in the American Midwest Allington experienced a variety of extreme weather, which prompted his interest in photographing storms.

'One day after school, a tornado warning was issued for our area and the updraft of the storm went right over my neighbourhood,' he said.

'I was completely awestruck that the sky could produce something so incredibly beautiful and so destructive at the same time. I started learning about weather and looking at other photographers' images online and eventually learnt some forecasting techniques and how to read weather models,' Allington added.

'Then I started to chase. It seemed natural to pick up a camera to start to document the things I saw. I haven't looked back since,' he went on.

Braving the unpredictability of the weather, Allington positions himself in the 'inflow' of the storm - the air feeding its updraft which helps to sustain it.

The excitement of photographing the storm combines with the stress to stay ahead of it, and Allington has often driven dozens of miles to see nothing but blue skies as a 'cap' of warm air stops the storm developing.

Only occasionally is his dedication rewarded. One image, titled 'Dodge', captures the moment a sunset illuminates a sudden lightning bolt - creating an orange rainbow.

'This is my favourite image', Allington said. 'We had been chasing an intense line of thunderstorms across areas of Western Kansas, and as sunset approached we decided to let a weakening storm overtake us.'

'It passed us by right as the sun set and as we looked east, we saw the rain and clouds lit up by the sun producing an amazing rainbow. The colours were unreal,' he said.

'It's always been a goal of mine to get lightning and a rainbow together - add in a crazy orange sunset and I was pretty pleased with how the day played out,' he went on to say.
