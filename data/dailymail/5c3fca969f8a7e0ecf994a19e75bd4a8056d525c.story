It was almost a party to remember for all the wrong reasons.

Leaning forward to blow out the candles on her 50th birthday cake, Ohio State coach Urban Meyer's wife Shelley managed to catch her hair on fire.

The exact moment was caught on camera by their daughter Nicki, who posted the picture to social media with the heartfelt message, 'You know you're 50 when your hair catches fire.

'Shelley Meyer girl on fire. Literally. The most beautiful mommy in the world! Never a dull moment. #typical.'

Celebrating her 25th wedding anniversary this year with Urban, the first couple of Ohio college football laughed off the affair, with Shelley tweeting the picture herself online.

Indeed, before taking over at Ohio State, Urban was head coach of the Florida Gators from 2005 to 2010 and is famed for his motivational line, 'run like your hair's on fire'.

Busy preparing for the upcoming Sugar Bowl with Alabama, Urban will go up against Nick Saban.

Saban's top-seeded Alabama Crimson Tide (12-1) faces Meyer's fourth-seeded Ohio State Buckeyes (12-1) on New Year's Day, a semifinal matchup between two of the nation's most storied programs.

Saban has established himself as perhaps the greatest coach of this generation, winning three national titles at Alabama after taking a BCS title during his time at LSU.

Meyer captured a pair of national titles at Florida, and now he's two wins away from landing another with the Buckeyes.
