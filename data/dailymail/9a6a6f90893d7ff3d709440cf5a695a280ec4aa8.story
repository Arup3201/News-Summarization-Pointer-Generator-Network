Michael Bradley talked previously about the USA’s ‘willingness to suffer’ in this World Cup.

Few took him as literally as things played out on Monday night.

The United States secured a dramatic 2-1 win against Ghana - the team that has bested them at every level they’ve played competitively since they knocked them out of the group stage back in 2006.

In many ways, the game last night was a reverse of the 2010 match. In that one, the States dictated the play to the Black Stars but didn’t finish their chances.

On Thursday, Ghana were the aggressor, creating 20 shots to the US’s seven, but could only once find the back of the net.

US manager Jurgen Klinsmann has talked incessantly about changing the US soccer system and play technically but for all the rhetoric the US did not control the match last night save for the opening salvo. Clint Dempsey attacked Ghana's right back flank and in goal worthy of questioning, 'Why Soldado for Spurs?' pinged a low liner in off the far post after introducing Ghana centerback John Boye to his jet stream.

USA, as most teams do, got tentative after taking the lead and were forced to do so further when Jozy Altidore pulled his hamstring sprinting for an over-the-top ball.

The injury and substitution exacerbated a major flaw in Jurgen Klinsmann’s squad selection: no back-up target man.

The US - as has been often the case under Klinsmann opted for a pragmatic and conservative approach - unable to hold the ball up the field and unwilling to open up their rear guard through swift counterattacking.

It was a painful watch for US fans as the US seemed to go into 'hold on' mode in the 23’.

A trading of goals in the closing stages kept the scoreline in the US favor but the US’s preparation - the States used two subs before the 46th minute from non-contact muscle strains - and tactics - an inability to re-purpose the ball to their more dangerous right flank, and the absence of a simple adjustment of moving a striker over a fullback in an attempt to win more outlet duels - should be questioned.

At the end of the day it was some simple German fundamentals that Klinsmann instilled early in his coaching tenure - specifically playing a simple holder than many questioned and moving the US centre-backs closer together - that won the day as the US conceded just once.

Klinsmann did something his predecessor’s couldn’t - he beat Ghana. Can he keep dealing victories through his audacious tactics is up next?
