Two drug addicts have been found guilty of murdering a transvestite and keeping his rotting body in a suitcase in a squalid flat for several weeks.

Big Issue sellers Tracy Hurrell, 32, and David Hardman, 51, were convicted of Lionel Morl's murder after a month-long trial at Preston Crown Court.

Police found Mr Morl's body decomposing in the suitcase in Hardman's flat in Manchester - after noticing foul smells during an unrelated visit to a property next door.

A post mortem found that the victim, who went by the name of Suzie and wore women's clothes, had been dead for several weeks after being violently attacked.

A jury heard that Hurrell and Hardman ‘preyed’ on Mr Morl, 49, to get money to feed their addictions to heroin, crack cocaine and alcohol.

They then attacked and murdered him, stuffed him into the case and continued to collect his benefits cheques.

The murder inquiry began on August 11 last year after Mr Morl’s body was discovered in grim circumstances.

Police were called to Hardman’s neighbours on Victoria Street, Openshaw, to investigate a separate incident.

But the smell coming from Hardman's flat next door was so awful that officers went to search it.

They found the remains of Mr Morl, who lived in nearby Brade Close, in the suitcase on the bathroom floor.

Photographs
taken inside the flat show how officers found many empty bottles of 
alcohol inside, with filthy mugs and plates filling the sink.

The
court heard that Hurrell had been living at Hardman’s flat until 
October 2010, but had moved out before returning to Openshaw in May last
year.

She moved in with Hardman but after a row she became homeless and befriended Mr Morl.

Hurrell moved in with Mr Morl but she began bullying him, treating the flat as her own and threatened him with a knife.

Mr Morl’s post office card - which he used to withdraw his fortnightly invalidity benefit of £200 - went missing twice before he died, and continued to be used after the killing.

Hurrell, of no fixed address, and Hardman, of Victoria Street, Openshaw, both denied murdering Mr Morl.

They each initially blamed the other for his death. The jury took five-and-a-half hours to find them guilty of murder.

The pair were also charged with perverting the course of justice by hiding Mr Morl’s body.

Hardman admitted the charge, but Hurrell denied it and was found guilty after the trial.

They are due to be sentenced next month.
