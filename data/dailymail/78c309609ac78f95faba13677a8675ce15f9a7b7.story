An antique telephone which goes up for sale next week may finally solve the oft-told story that the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh inhabit separate bedrooms.

The 1960s device, which comes in a teak case, is believed to have been Philip’s personal bedside phone at Buckingham Palace - and has a special button labelled ‘HM Bedroom’.

Incredibly it was found dumped in a skip after contractors carried out refurbishment work at Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace several years ago.

Separate bedrooms? This antique telephone is believed to have been the Duke of Edinburgh's personal bedside phone at Buckingham Palace - and has a special button labelled 'HM Bedroom'

For sale: The antique telephone, which goes up for sale next week, may finally solve the oft-told story that the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, pictured at Royal Ascot this week, inhabit separate bedrooms

Alongside it was a bronze wall plaque engraved 'Tradesmen's Entrance to TRH The Prince and Princess of Wales' Apartment' which was once attached to the wall of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana's Kensington Palace home.

The unique items are due to go under the hammer next Tuesday at Colchester auctioneer Reeman Dansie's sale of Royal memorabilia.

The phone also has hotlines to each of 
the couple’s children: Prince of Wales, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and
 Sec. Princess Anne.

Find: A bronze wall plaque engraved 'Tradesmen's Entrance to TRH The Prince and Princess of Wales' Apartment' was found alongside the telephone

There are also buttons labelled for 
several members of Philip’s staff (known as the Dof E internally at the 
palace): Dof E Equerry, Chf Clk to D of E, D of E Pt. (Private) Sec as 
well as D 0f E Study.

The 
phone is expected to fetch £200 to £300, while the bronze plaque from 
Charles and Diana's Kensington Palace apartment is estimated at £50 to 
£70.

Auctioneer James 
Grinter said:  ‘The phone from Buckingham Palace is particularly 
intriguing.  It not only has a line to the Queen's bedroom, but links to
 all four of her children.

‘It also has lines to six of the Duke of Edinburgh's most senior staff.’ 

Discovery: Incredibly the phone and plaque were found dumped in a skip after contractors carried out refurbishment work at Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace several years ago
