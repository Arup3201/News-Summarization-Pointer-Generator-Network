Domestic violence campaigners plan to burn copies of the best-selling book Fifty Shades of Grey on a bonfire - because they claim it celebrates abuse.

It is feared the themes of sadomasochism in the raunchy trilogy by E.L. James will create a new generation of violent men, according to campaigners.

Clare Phillipson, director of Women in Need in Sunderland, has launched a campaign titled Fifty Shades of Abuse which aims to stage a mass-burning of the books.

The charity has placed wheelie bins outside its head office for people to place copies of Fifty Shades in before the books will be burned in a huge bonfire on November 5.

Miss Phillipson has dismissed suggestions that a book bonfire has echoes of fascism.

She said: 'Fiction shapes our culture. This series of books are a passport for abusive men thinking their actions of abusing women is justified.

'What we are planning to do could be interpreted as having fascist connotations.

'I’m not a Nazi but I believe we must turn this dangerous fiction into ashes.

'The manipulation exercised in Nazi Germany in the 1930s is an example of the power of propaganda.

'They voted for Hitler who fooled them into believing he was the right man to lead a country.

'I’m not leading a moral crusade against erotica. Fifty Shades is a classic tale of abuse.'

During the infamous book burnings in Nazi Germany, 'un-German' novels that did not complement the values of the country under Hitler’s fascist rule were destroyed.

Up to 25,000 books were burned by the Main Office for Press and Propaganda of the German Student Association on May 10, 1933.

Miss Phillipson has been working with abused women and violent men for more than 30 years and thinks the popularity of Fifty Shades is 'a step back' in society.

She added: 'We also have to think of 
the impact the popularity of this book is having on the next generation 
of young men and women who are maturing sexually.

Fifty Shades of Grey has sold more than 5.3million copies in Britain, making it the best-selling book in the UK since records began

'A teenager reading the book could think love is about healing a psychopath, or being forced into a confidentiality contract on the first date, or training in the gym because their sex lives are going to be so violent their bodies need to be toughened.

'It’s vile, disgusting and dangerous.'

Fifty Shades of Grey has sold more than 5.3million copies in Britain, making it the best-selling book in the UK since records began.

And more than 40m copies of the trilogy have been sold worldwide.

A spokesperson for its publishers Random House said: 'The Fifty Shades trilogy is a work of romantic fiction.

'The sex scenes in the book are entirely consensual with the woman being a willing participant.'
