Perfect for tourists who have seen enough beaches or city landscapes, this floating hotel offers a room with a different kind of view: Ten feet beneath the surface of a Swedish lake.

The Utter Inn offers guests a night to remember, with windows in every wall of the bedroom looking out into the water, teeming with fish.

The ‘floatel’ is the brainchild of artist Mikael Genburg, known for his unique hotel experiences including one in a tree in a city centre park, and 'Ooops', the sunken villa which opened this summer not far from Utter Inn by Lake Malaren, Vasteras.

Idyllic: The floating hotel is located in the middle of a Swedish lake east of Stockholm

Above surface: On top of the sundeck is a hut which is designed to resemble a traditional Swedish cottage and guests step inside to climb down to their bedroom

Utter Inn has an above-surface kitchen inside a little hut made to look like a traditional Swedish cottage.

At bedtime guests climb down the hatch to their sleeping quarters which has an all-round view of life under the surface.

Mr Genburg, who opened Utter Inn in 2000, said the idea came to him out of the blue and he was curious to see if it could work.

He said: ‘I don't think there is an 
experience quite like sleeping underwater and many people have come to 
find out if they like it.

Interior: Despite the tough steel and glass exterior, the bedroom room has a homely feel with a hand-knitted Swedish rug on the wooden floor

‘It's like a reverse aquarium - the fish like looking in at the guests and are fascinated by them.

'It's as if you're sat on your own island when you're on board - it's just an amazing experience.'

After being taken out to the floating 
hut by Utter Inn staff, visitors can relax on the deck or use the hotel’s
 inflatable dinghy to explore one of the uninhabited islands in Lake 
Malaren before a night underwater.

The artist admitted that he had his doubts about the project when it first opened.

'I was quite worried as it was an unproven concept, but now I love it!

'Because there is a window on every side, you feel totally submerged in the lake.'

Explore: In case the little hut gets too claustrophobic, guests can get in the inflatable dingy and take a trip around the lake

The Utter Inn is located in southern Sweden, just east of the capital Stockholm

Mikael said: ‘A lot of people who have visited have said they slept extremely well because of the rocking motion on board.

‘People with busy lives and 
high-pressured jobs tend to visit, I think for the natural peace there 
is in the very relaxing surroundings.

‘You can hear the lapping of the water outside of the windows as well which I think is a very therapeutic sound.

‘I always want to be by water - it's so soothing, romantic and calm - all at the same time.’

Goodnight: A nearby town brightens up the already light Swedish summer night as the guests at Utter Inn nip off to sleep with the fishes
