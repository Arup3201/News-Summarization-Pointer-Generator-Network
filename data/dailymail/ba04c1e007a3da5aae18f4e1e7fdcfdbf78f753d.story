It is a given that an actress would want to look her most beautiful and radiant at the Oscars.

But last night, it appeared that a large number of the leading ladies on the red carpet achieved this by wearing exactly the same make-up look.

Stars including Nicole Kidman, Sandra Bullock, Halle Berry and Kristen Stewart all sported the same soft pink glossy lips, gray smoky eyes, matte skin contoured with bronzer and the lightest touch of blush on the apples of the cheeks.

'It's crazy,' celebrity make-up artist Rachel Wood told MailOnline. 'It's like they all phoned each other and said, "Let's be make-up twins!"'

Indeed, while the stars' chosen gowns and hairstyles 
varied wildly, it seemed that there was just one cosmetics 
kit in circulation.

'The Oscars make-up is very Art Nouveau, Art Deco,' she said. 'Think the Great Gatsby or the classic film Metropolis.'

And there is good reason that the trend was so popular last night. It is universally flattering - no wonder Wood had nothing but praise.

'Everyone looks classic beautiful and understated,' she said.

Celebrity make-up artist RACHEL WOOD says:

To achieve this sheer and subtle look - which is a very pale gray smoky eye, matte natural skin and baby pink lips and cheeks - I'd stick to cream texture products.
