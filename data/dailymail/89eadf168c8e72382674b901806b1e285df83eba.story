Chelsea goalkeeper Thibault Courtois insists he has not lost any sleep over his high-profile errors of recent weeks.

The Belgian was exceptional for the Blues in their win over Queens Park Rangers on Sunday.

It was a far cry from his displays in Chelsea's previous two matches, however.

His poor touch allowed Abel Hernandez to score in Chelsea's 3-2 win over Hull on March 22 before Stoke's Charlie Adam beat him from 66 yards last weekend.

But Courtois says his confidence levels have not waned as a result.

'I never doubted that I can't catch the ball. Against Hull, I just tried to make the best solution,' he said.

'It was not the best control, but in the second half I showed that I am mentally strong and I saved the team.

'Against Stoke, if you want to play high as a team, you as a goalkeeper have to play high as a team as well. Charlie Adam did a good strike and that can happen.

'But I showed against QPR that if you play high, you can go get the ball from the midfield. If I'm on the 16 yard box, I can go get it there. For me it's not a problem.

Courtois has also faced criticism for failing to keep out Charlie Adam's 66-yard strike against Stoke

'I continue. I never doubt myself. That's my strength. I helped the team with two good saves against QPR and I'm happy.

'The most important thing is the team and against Hull and Stoke we still won.

'I'm 22 and still learning. These were moments which I could learn from.'
