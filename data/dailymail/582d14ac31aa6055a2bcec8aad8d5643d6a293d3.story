In artistic terms they were at polar opposites of the photographic spectrum.

The wanton destruction and grim resilience of war is not a subject you would associate with high fashion glamour shots of the rich and beautiful.

But when flamboyant photographer Cecil Beaton was enlisted during the Second World War, his striking collection showed the six-year conflict in a new, more graceful, picturesque light.

Victoria Station in 1942. The soldier pictured was the butler of a close
 friend of photographer Cecil Beaton

As well as glamorous portraits of British soldiers, Beaton's portfolio 
also catalogues famous landmarks, such as a war-ravaged Bloomsbury 
Square in London

War effort: A female welder works on the deck of a new ship in Tyneside in 1943, in another expertly-composed Beaton photograph from the 7,000-strong collection

Dressed to impress: Smartly-dressed Flight Lieutenant David Donaldson poses for a portrait. Right, a wren serving with the crew of a harbour launch in Portsmouth, 1941

The photographer, whose most notable subjects included Elizabeth Taylor, Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn, was commissioned for an altogether grittier photographic project that could be used as propaganda.

Moving him away from his usual fare of royalty and fashion models, the Ministry of Information asked Beaton to document Britain's war effort.

The renowned photographer pictured young men and women in a typically glamorous light, in spite of the ravages, destruction and chaos engulfing Britain in 1940.

Battered: A wider image from Beaton's collection shows bomb damage to the Church of St. Anne and St. Agnes in London in 1940

Make do and mend: A sailor on board HMS Alcantara uses a portable sewing machine to repair a signal flag on a voyage to Sierra Leone, while a British sailor on shore leave in Harrogate looks natural in front of the camera in 1941

Photogenic: Although also cataloguing damage to buildings, 
Beaton also captured images like this one of Wren officers at 
the Royal Naval College in Greenwich in 1941

War heroes: Squadron Leader M L Robinson of No 609 Squadron RAF sits on the wing of his Hawker Hurricane at RAF Biggin Hill in 1941 for a relaxed portrait picture

Blitz spirit: A workman uses a wheelbarrow to clear debris from the floor of St Mary-le-Bow church 
after its first bombing. It was completed destroyed in 1942.

His eye-catching portfolio stays away from corpses, blood and the unimaginable horror of the front line, featuring instead photogenic soldiers presenting a united front for the Allied Forces.

Even so, Beaton does tug on the heartstrings in his collection: one of the most memorable images shows wounded three-year-old Eileen Dunne at Great Ormond Street Hospital, in an evocative picture which would later grace the cover of Life magazine in September 1940.

The picture was clearly effective - as it was taken with the aim of generating sympathy for the British and helping sway America into intervening in the war.

Iconic: Renowned photographer Cecil Beaton, who died in January 1980

Throughout a distinguished career, Cecil Beaton achieved worldwide fame as a photographer, designer, writer, cartoonist, diarist and socialite.

The Hampstead-born photographer is widely remembered as the leading British portrait and fashion photographer of his day.

During his career he photographed Queen Elizabeth and the Queen Mother, who he described as his favourite royal sitter.

He was also employed as staff photographer for Vanity Fair and Vogue, and went on photograph Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor.

As a commissioned war photographer, it was Beaton's image of a young girl in Great Ormond Street Hospital which arguably persuaded America to join the global conflict.

Before the image was published on the cover of Life magazine in 1940, America was yet to participate in the Second World War.

But the evocative image saw the U.S. public put further pressure on their government to assist Britain.

After the Second World War he turned to Broadway, working as a set, lighting and costume designer.

His creative flair saw Beaton win Academy Awards for costume design on films Gigi (1958) and My Fair Lady (1964).

He also designed the period costumes for the 1970 film On a Clear Day You Can See Forever.

By the end of the 1970s his health had deteriorated, and he died at his Wiltshire home in January 1980, aged 76.

Elsewhere he features soldiers 
relaxing after a Libyan desert patrol and a sailor repairing a signal 
flag on the way to Sierra Leone.

Beaton
 took a staggering 7,000 pictures in all during the project, which were 
passed through the ministry's Censorship Division before being published
 in books and magazines.

But
 after being catalogued without using his name, the raft of images 
became lost in archives until they were recently re-discovered.

A collection of more than 100 pictures
 are now on display at London's Imperial War Museum, in an exhibition 
titled 'Cecil Beaton: Theatre of War'.

Hilary Roberts, head curator of the museum's photographic archive, found over 100 unknown pictures while examining files.

She
 recognised them as being similar in style to the work of Beaton, and 
confirmed they were his work by matching them to his diary records.

She said: 'The Ministry was in disarray in those days and the records weren't kept well.

'It was not practice to record the name of the photographer. But we always knew these images existed somewhere.'

After ceasing wartime operations, the
 Ministry of Information deposited Beaton's war photos with the Imperial
 War Museum, London.

The photographer was briefly reunited with his vast body of work shortly before his death.

All hands to the pump: A fireman dampens down flames in a bombed building during the Blitz in London in 1940. Four years later, Beaton photographed the Chinese Police force grouped in a circular doorway at headquarters in Chengtu

Describing the experience, he wrote 
in his diary: 'Yesterday I went to the Imperial War Museum, not my 
favourite place, to see the collection of photographs that I had taken 
during the war for the Ministry of Information.

'It was an extraordinary experience 
to relive those war years; so much of it had been forgotten, and most of
 the people are now dead.

'It was fascinating to see the scenes
 in old Imperial Simla, the rickshaws drawn by uniformed servants, the 
grandeur of the houses, the palaces, the bar scenes, the men on leave 
swigging beer, I had not realised that I had taken so many documentary 
pictures, some of purely technical interest.

'Looking at them today, I spotted 
ideas that are now ‘accepted’, but which, thirty years ago, were before 
their time. The sheer amount of work I had done confounded me.'
