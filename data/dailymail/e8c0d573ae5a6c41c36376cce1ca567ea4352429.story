Following a 3D re-release in 2013 to celebrate its 20th anniversary, Jurassic Park's total gross eclipsed $1 billion, making it only the 17th film in cinema history to do so.

Jurassic Park is considered by many as one of the greatest science fiction films ever made, as well as a landmark in the vector of visual effects, in regards to computer-generated imagery and animatronics.

The film was followed by two sequels, The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III, which both became box office successes but received a mixed critical response.

A fourth film entitled Jurassic World is scheduled for release in 2015.
