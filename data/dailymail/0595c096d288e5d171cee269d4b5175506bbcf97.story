Steven Gerrard will wear his favoured No 8 jersey when he signs for the LA Galaxy this summer, the MLS club have announced.

The Liverpool captain has had the number on the back of his shirt for more than 10 years at Anfield, having previously donned the No 17 strip.

And LA Galaxy fans have already been urged to buy the new top, which he could wear for the first time in the game against the San Jose Earthquakes on July 17. 

LA Galaxy tweeted on Thursday: 'IT'S OFFICIAL: Steven Gerrard will wear the No. 8 jersey for the #LAGalaxy'

But the jersey won't come cheap, with the club allowing you to pre-order the kit for almost £134 ($204.99) for the long-sleeved strip and £114 ($174.99) for the short-sleeved.

To put that in comparison, you can currently buy a Liverpool 2014/15 kit with Gerrard's name on the back for £42.50 (long sleeved) or £40 (short sleeved), with the current discount on the website.

Gerrard plays in his last ever Merseyside derby this weekend, as Liverpool travel to Goodison Park to play arch rivals Everton.

Asked if the Everton fans will be happy to bid farewell to the 34-year-old ahead of his move to LA Galaxy, manager Brendan Rodgers replied: 'I'm sure they will.

'He has been incredible for the club and been outstanding in so many derby games. He'll want to win, like he does every time,' the Northern Irish boss said on Thursday.

'How will he deal with the emotion of it being his last? Like he has all the others -- by being focused on the team getting a result.'
