The FBI never conducted an investigation about a reported crash of several flying saucers in New Mexico detailed in a memo 63 years ago - which is now believed to have been an elaborate hoax.

The memo from Guy Hottel, the special agent in charge of the Washington field office in 1950, was released publicly via the FBI's website in April 2011.

Of all the agency's documents that have been made public on its website, the so-called 'Hottel memo' is by far the most popular, with nearly a million views.

But as the FBI admits in a blog post appearing on its website, agents never took a second look into the bizarre report.

In the memo, whose subject line is 'Flying Saucers', Agent Hottel says that an Air Force investigator had stated that 'three so-called flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico.'

The investigator gave the information to a special agent, he said. The FBI blurred out the names of both the agent and the investigator's identity.

Agent Hottel went on to write: 'They were described as being circular in shape with raised centers, approximately 50 feet in diameter.

'Each one was occupied by three bodies of human shape but only 3 feet tall,' he stated.

The truth is out there: Roswell became infamous after reports that a flying saucer had crashed in the desert near a military base there in 1947

The bodies were 'dressed in a metallic cloth of a very fine texture. Each body was bandaged in a manner similar to the blackout suits used by speed flyers and test pilots.'

Despite the elaborate description, the Hottel memo has been exposed as nothing more than misinformation provided by a scam artist named Silas Newtwon, NBC News reported.

Above Top Secret honcho Mark Allin told the network: 'The memo is based on a hoax that was carried out by a convicted con man named Silas Newton, and it was debunked years ago.

'It's a pretty good and interesting hoax story, to be certain, but there is no value in it beyond that.'

Agent Hottel said that the informant claimed the saucers had been found in New Mexico 'due to the fact that the Government has a very high-powered radar set-up in that area and it is believed the radar interferes with the controlling mechanism of the saucers'.

He then stated that the special agent did not attempt to investigate further.

The FBI writes in its blog that Director J. Edgar Hoover authorized agents to verify the existence of flying saucers at the request of the Air Force.

It adds: 'That practice ended in July 1950, four months after the Hottel memo, suggesting that our Washington Field Office didnâ€™t think enough of that flying saucer story to look into it.'

The blog goes on: 'The Hottel memo does not prove the existence of UFOs; it is simply a second- or third-hand claim that we never investigated.'

Agent Hottel died in 1990.

The town of Roswell in New Mexico became infamous after reports that a flying saucer had crashed in the desert near a military base there on or around July 2, 1947.

The bodies of aliens were said to have been recovered and autopsied by the U.S. military, but American authorities have been accused of covering the incident up.
