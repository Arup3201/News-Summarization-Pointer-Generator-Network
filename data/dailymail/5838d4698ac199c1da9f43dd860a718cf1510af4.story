England were in for a prolonged stay in Italy following Tuesday night's 1-1 friendly draw after their flight was held up due to a 'technical issue'.

Andros Townsend came off the bench to rescue the Three Lions from defeat with a stunning strike in Turin after Graziano Pelle had netted the opener for the hosts at the Juventus Stadium.

But, after the match, news of the stricken plane became apparent with the England squad now due to return home on Wednesday.

England manager Roy Hodgson said: 'We only know it's a technical issue. That is all we know so that has put the flight tonight out of the question.

'We hope to leave relatively early in the morning.'

A Football Association spokesman confirmed England have booked a return flight at noon on Wednesday.
