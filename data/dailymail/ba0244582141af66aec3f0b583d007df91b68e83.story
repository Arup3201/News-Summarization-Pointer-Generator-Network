Manchester is the laziest place in Britain with nearly half of residents exercising less than once a month, according to a new study.

The country's increasingly sedentary lifestyle means that by 2030 the average person will use just a quarter more energy in a day than if they had stayed in bed.

And Mancunians are in the worst state of all, with 40 per cent doing less than half an hour of exercise a month - classing them as 'inactive'.

Lazy: The results were worst in Manchester, Sandwell, the West Midlands, Salford and Bradford (pictured)

Nearby Salford and Sandwell in the 
West Midlands were nearly as bad, with non-exercisers also making up 
more than a third of the population in places such as Bradford, Slough 
and Sunderland.

By contrast, Wokingham in Berkshire is the most active area, as 82 per cent of residents exercise at leasts once in every month.

Well-heeled
 areas of London and the Home Counties such as Windsor, Kensington and 
Oxfordshire also did well in the figures compiled by public health 
experts Ukactive.

The ‘pandemic’ of inactivity in poor areas of England is leading to 17 per cent of premature deaths, the report said.

The
 health group found that in the most inactive areas, there is an average
 of 342 premature deaths per 100,000 people per year, compared with 242 
in those where people exercise the most.

the London borough of Richmond upon Thames (pictured) and Wokingham in Berkshire - 
one in five people did not manage 30 minutes of exercise

Inactivity costs the economy in each 
local authority £18 million per 100,000 people every year on average, 
the study found. Cutting physical inactivity by just 1per cent a year 
over a five-year period would save the UK economy just under £1.2 
billion, it said.

Researchers
 found that the most inactive local authorities have, on average, a 
third fewer leisure facilities than the least inactive areas.

But
 they said there is no link between levels of exercise and the amount of
 green space in each region.

This contrasts with a report published 
yesterday from the the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), 
which found a lack of green space meant people were more likely to 
suffer ill health and walk less.

Research carried out by Ukactive has shown sedentary lifestyles mean that by 2030 the average person will use just a quarter more energy in a day than if they had stayed in bed

David Stalker, chief executive officer of Ukactive, said inactivity was ‘a distinct risk to public health’.

Fred Turok, chairman of Ukactive, said: ‘It’s no longer acceptable that physical inactivity remains the forgotten cause of death in the UK.

'More deprived areas are faring worse in a physical inactivity pandemic - with no national strategy to improve our fitness levels, from before we take our first steps to our last.’

Lord Sebastian Coe, who is backing the report, said: ‘Physical inactivity currently accounts for nearly one fifth of premature deaths in the UK.

'With projections showing that inactivity levels are due to increase by a further 15% by 2030, there is no doubt that the issue requires immediate national attention and urgent action.’
