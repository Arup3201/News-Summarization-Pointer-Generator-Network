Janan Harb says she was secretly married to the late King Fahd - then a prince and minister of the interior of Saudi Arabia - in 1968

A British woman who claims she was married to the late King of Saudi Arabia has won an early round of a multi-million pound legal battle with his son, as she threatens to expose details of her late husband's harem.

Janan Harb says she was secretly married to the  late King Fahd - then a prince and minister of the interior of Saudi Arabia - in 1968 when she was 19, and he had promised to provide for her 
financially for the rest of her life.

But she said she was forced to leave the country several years later, because his family disapproved of their union.

Mrs Harb says she is owed a lump sum of £12 million - promised to her 11 years ago -plus the ownership of two high-value apartments in central London.

She has warned Prince Abdul Aziz - son of the late King Fahd - that she will 'expose' what it is really like to be married to a Saudi king if he does not pay up.

Prince Abdul has argued the High Court in England had no jurisdiction to try Ms Harb’s claim because he had 'state immunity'.

But a High Court judge today ruled against him after a hearing in London.

Mrs Justice Rose said the prince could not rely on a defence of state immunity to defeat Mrs Harb’s claim.

After the ruling, Mrs Harb, who is in her 60s, told reporters that she was 'very happy and relieved'.

'After 12 years of persistence I am very happy and relieved,' Mrs Harb told reporters after today’s ruling.

'If
 the prince is going to appeal, I am going to accept the offer of the 
movie of the book I have written - I am going to spill the beans.'

Mrs Harb says Prince Abdul Aziz had told her that he was prepared to honour the terms of his father’s promise - and had offered to pay a lump sum of £12 million and to transfer to her the title of two central London properties.

She says she has not received the money or the properties - and has taken legal action.

The judge said Prince Abdul Aziz had not made any response 'as regards the accuracy or otherwise' of Mrs Harb’s allegations.

His submissions had been 'limited to contesting the jurisdiction of the court'.

Mrs Justice Rose said she had seen a letter from the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in London saying the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia supported the prince’s claim for state immunity.

Mrs Justice Rose had analysed legal argument at a High Court hearing in London in May and handed down her ruling at a hearing in London today.

The prince was not at today’s hearing.

Mrs Justice Rose said Mrs Harb alleged that the prince had made his offer at a meeting in 2003, two years before King Fahd died.

The judge said it had been assumed that the prince would have been acting as King Fahd’s representative.

She said if Mrs Harb had brought the claim when King Fahd was alive - and serving as king - both he and the prince would have been able to claim 'sovereign immunity'.

Mrs Justice Rose said she had been asked to decide whether, when King Fahd died, and ceased to be head of state of Saudi Arabia, immunity continued to extend to everything he did when head of state.

The judge said there was no evidence of a similar claim being brought before.

A spokesman for law firm Neumans, which represented Mrs Harb, said later: 'Mrs Harb is passionate about sharing her personal account of what it is truly like to be married to a Saudi King and believes the exposure will be of public interest.

'Her story has received international interest from film producers and she is currently in detailed discussions to progress the adaptation of her book into a film. There are also negotiations under way with regard to the publishing of her book in advance of this.'

Mrs Harb’s solicitor, Mandeep Kaur Virdee, added: 'We are delighted with the outcome of this judgment. The law surrounding this area has already established, confirming that personal immunity ceases when a head of state is no longer in office for any reason.

'The prince’s application sought to extend the personal immunity privilege by suggesting that if a sovereign dies whilst still an acting monarch, the deceased and their agents could continue to enjoy the privilege of personal immunity

'This judgment confirms that once a sovereign is out of office for whatever reason, including death, personal immunity does not survive.'

Mrs Harb says she was wife number two in the King's harem.

Fahd already had one official wife, Anoud, who went on to bear him 11 children. Although the two women knew about one another, Fahd decreed that they would never meet.

Mrs Harb says she was kept as a virtual prisoner, albeit in luxury.

Her father, who had separated from her mother, lived in a villa inside the palace walls, as did her sister and brother-in-law.

There was also a villa for one of her close friends and her husband but beyond these six people and the staff, which included two personal maids, a butler, two drivers, two gardeners, two handymen and two chefs, she rarely saw anyone else.

Then, in 1970, after two years of marriage, Mrs Harb was suddenly ordered to leave the kingdom by Fahd's brother. She was given two hours to go and her belongings were forwarded to the Saudi embassy in Beirut. She was 23.
