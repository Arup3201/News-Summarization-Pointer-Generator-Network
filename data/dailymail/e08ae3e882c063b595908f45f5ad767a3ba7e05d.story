The home which was built for former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser and his wife Tamie has been opened for inspection just a day after his sudden passing.

The stylish four-bedroom property in Canberra, known as JM Fraser House, is up for sale for about $2million.

It has been on the market since last year but Berkely Residential real estate agent Bill Lyristakis told Daily Mail Australia he has hopes that it will sell today.

The spacious 1341sqm property is located minutes away from the Parliamentary triangle

The spacious 1341sqm property is located minutes away from the Parliamentary triangle and described as a 'sensational slice of Canberra's political history' by agents.

The residence on Daly Street, Deakin was listed in October last year for around $2million, Mr Lyristakis said.

The property was built three years after the Frasers married, The Sydney Morning Herald reports.

Mr Fraser was reportedly a backbencher when he moved into the house.

The property was last sold 20 years ago to vendors Tony and Sue Marinos who are the third owners of the home, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

The design of the residence, by Melbourne Society Architect Guilford Bell, combines Georgian architecture with American plantation style.
