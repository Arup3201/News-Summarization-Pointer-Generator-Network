The son of a German officer whose men killed a French captain in hand-to-hand fighting in the First World War has traced the relatives of the dead man nearly 100 years later.

A yellowing troop newspaper led the son of Johannes Richter to the family of Captain André Vacquier who died in 1918 in the Vosges region of France.

Helmut Richter, 78, is proud to have discovered and befriended the family of the man his father met in combat, he told Germany's Der Spiegel magazine this week.

The newspaper article was among the possessions of his father. A military correspondent described how Lieutenant Richter's platoon came across a French outpost in a wood in southern Alsace in the summer of 1918.

'The patrol decided to take up the fight,' said the article. 

'It had been lying in wait when it heard laughter and loud voices. The enemy came forward.

'Every nerve was strained. Nearer, nearer - and then the Germans leaped out. The lieutenant shot one and seized another by the throat with the intention of taking him alive.'

But the Frenchman was strong. Lt. Richter grappled with him but was losing the struggle until one of his men put a bullet in his head, the report went on.

For years this fading relic of the 'war to end all wars' lay in a suitcase. 

When Lt. Richter died in 1977 his widow passed it on to her daughter and ten years ago it came into the possession of his son Helmut at his home in Frankfurt.

Also inside the suitcase were two religious medals, a metal plaque and a leather cigarette holder. 

Upon examining the metal plaque more closely Helmut saw it bore the inscription: 'Capt. Vacquier, Montignac Dordogne.'

These were the souvenirs of war that Johannes Richter brought back to Germany with him. 

His victim on June 5 1918 was listed as missing and, two years later, declared dead 'fighting the enemy'.

Andre Vacquier was a lawyer when he was called up, a father of two daughters, a holder of the French Legion of Honour. He was twice wounded in combat before he fell.

His grave was found after the war and his widow transferred his body back to the Dordogne for burial.

Helmut Richter said his father, like many fathers, never spoke about the war which cost nine million soldiers their lives. 

'We had a drive around Alsace in 1971,' he said, 'and he pointed out many things, about the way the vegetation had changed.'

But he did not describe the horrors of the trenches or the comradeship, the fear, the disease and constant knife-edge existence of front-line troops. 

This gnawed at Helmut Richter and, the day he found the possessions of Vacquier, he vowed to do something about it.

Using the Internet, he looked up the name of the town of Montignac and, using his best schoolboy French, penned a letter to the mayor.

'Permit me to submit a little everyday affair to you,' he wrote, describing the events that led him to write to her. 

'If you can communicate to me the whereabouts of the family of Captain Vacquier so I can make contact I would be most grateful.'

The family was well known in Montignac, the house of the dead captain still in the possession of his heirs.

The letter was forwarded to Paris businessman François Leroux, a grandchild of André Vacquier and, together with his cousin, the only survivors of the family.

Leroux, 68, said he was 'electrified' by the letter but then began to have second thoughts; the French-German relationship, scarred by three wars  - beginning with the 1870 Franco-Prussian conflict and ending with WW2 - has never been easy.

'How should I have taken it?' he said. 

'Was this project generous, sympathetic, courageous? I didn't know.' 

But then something happened which made him opt to see the son of the man who killed his grandfather.

He learned he was to become the grandfather of a French-German child; his son Matthieu is married to a German woman. 

'I saw it as a moving indication,' he said.  

'I felt the coincidence of history as deeply symbolic moment.'

In a meeting at his apartment in Frankfurt, Helmut Richter handed over the possessions of Captain Vacquier to his family over coffee and cake.

Herr Richter said he felt like all the animosity between two tribes who lived on opposite sides of the Rhine 'vanished'.

'We made our peace with history,' said Ms. Leroux.  

'I am glad I came.'
