Confused: Justine McNally arrives at Wood Green Court Court today having admitted posing as a boy to get a teenage girl into bed

A schoolgirl who posed as a 'goth' boy called Scott for three-and-a-half years just to get another teenage girl into bed has been jailed for three years today.

Justine McNally, 18, duped her 16-year-old victim into believing she was male as they chatted online and carried on tricking her after they met by strapping a sex toy to her waist. 

Glaswegian McNally, then 17, lured the London schoolgirl into three sex sessions, promising her they would get married and have children.

The girl was even fooled into thinking she had lost her virginity to McNally in a darkened bedroom of a family friend's house.

McNally's secret was only exposed as a young woman when a friend of her mother found a sex toy in her backpack. 

She was sentenced at Wood Green Crown Court today after admitting six counts of sexual assault by penetration. 

'Because of the abuse of trust, the trauma to the victim, and the peculiar circumstances, this is an extraordinary case', said prosecutor David Markham.

'This case is about the defendant, then aged 17, sexually assaulting the victim, then aged 16, by deceiving her into believing that she, the defendant, was a boy.

'She obtained consent to physical intimacy between them by fraud. The case involves a very serious abuse of trust.'

McNally was jailed today by Judge James Patrick for the 'selfish and callous' deception.

She and her victim started their relationship when aged 12 and 13 after meeting through an online videogame.

During their three-and-a-half-year time together the girls 'spoke about what they wanted to do to each other' sexually, said Mr Markham. 

'Scott (McNally) spoke about what he wanted to do with his d***'.

They eventually met in March 2011, when McNally came to visit the girl in north London, staying with a friend of the family. 

They had talked about having sex during online webchats on MSN and on video calls, and the relationship turned physical on the first visit.

But McNally refused to remove her clothes while sexually touching the girl, the court was told.

'(The victim) offered to perform oral sex on him and went to touch his penis, but Scott said he didn't want her to do that and he was happy to pleasure her', said Mr Markham.

'So she did not touch his penis at any point.' 

He said at the first of three encounters, in March, May, and August 2011, the two girls tried to have sex.

'She (the victim) believed intercourse was being attempted, Scott had said he wanted her to lose her virginity to him and she was trying to make him happy', said Mr Markham.

'But she suffered a lot of pain and they settled for cuddling up together.'

The teenager was tearful throughout the sentencing hearing today as she was told prison was the only option for her crime because of the damage to the victim.

'She had her first sexual experience with you, and you abused her trust so badly she finds it difficult to trust other people', said Judge Patrick.

'I was selfish and callous behaviour - a grave abuse of trust of her, her family and friends through your behaviour over a period of years.'

The judge said her disguise as a Goth called Scott fooled everybody when she came to visit the girl in London, making trips to Camden and a fireworks night in Enfield.

'They met you with good faith and welcomed you into their homes', he said.

The court heard the girl had gone out to buy condoms ahead of sex sessions with 'Scott', and fully anticipated they would have sexual contact.

'You put your feelings before those of anyone else', said Judge Patrick.

'You have had a troubled history, but without wishing to minimise the effect of that on you, it's no more remarkable.

'You found the process of puberty complicated and had problems coming to terms with your sexuality.'

Judge Patrick said she would spend half her three year prison sentence behind bars before being released on licence.

'Clearly you didn't appreciate the seriousness of what you were doing', he added.

'You are an upset, distressed young woman, but the offence is so serious that a custodial sentence must follow.'

Case: Wood Green Crown Court (pictured) heard McNally had used a sex toy to bamboozle her teenage victim

McNally, supported by her father in court, will be on the Sex Offenders' Register for life and is banned from contact the victim or her mother.

Last year the girls had broken off their separate individual relationships and believed they were girlfriend and boyfriend, making plans to start a life together, the court heard.

'They talked about getting married and having children in the future', said Mr Markham.

When McNally tried to break off a previous relationship with a girlfriend in Glasgow, her cover was nearly blown when the victim and the girlfriend got into a furious row.

'That girlfriend made a comment about Scott being a girl', said prosecutor Mr Markham.

'When this was put to the defendant, the defendant laughed it off and joked about it. The way Scott dismissed it reassured her that everything was fine.'

McNally's secret was finally exposed in November 2011, when the family friend she was staying with got suspicious and looked through her possessions while on the phone to the girl's mother.

'The friend found a bra, a size 12 River Island top, and as she was talking, she found a strap on penis in the bag', said Mr Markham. 

Later in the evening, after dropping McNally off at the friend's house near Tottenham Hale train station, the mother said to her daughter: 'You do know Scott is a actually a girl?

'The victim entered a state of shock and denial, didn't know what to think or what to do', said Mr Markham. 

The mother and daughter then confronted McNally, who produced a picture on Facebook of her dressed in pink clothing and heels, and said she wanted to have a sex change to continue the relationship.

Mr Markham said the victim was 'literally sickened' by the revelations, and eventually ended the relationship and called police.

She told the court she now struggles to build relationships with friends and boyfriends, preferring to isolate herself.

'The sense of violation and vulnerability engendered by this crime left her with feelings of confusion and bewilderment', said Mr Markham. 

'What should be an exciting era in her life has been darkened by what has been done to her. 

'She feels completely bereft and besieged with self-doubt.' 

Defence barrister Keith Thomas said her deception should be seen as a situation that got out of hand rather than grooming.

'It got out of hand, particularly if you accept this didn't start as a deliberate grooming offence', said Mr Thomas.

'It's almost a rollercoaster ride, obvious they didn't meet for some considerable period of time.'

Mr Thomas said McNally, the youngest of four children, had suffered the divorce of her parents and was 'confused' about her gender issues.

'She had an unhappy upbringing which was confusing', he said.

'She found it more difficult than others to cope with the problems, within something of a dysfunctional family.'

McNally has admitted the deception was wrong, but continues to insist she did not know it was criminal at the time.

'This is a peculiar, extraordinary case - a one-off', said Mr Thomas.

'It is clear she needs help.

'This was happening to an unhappy and distressed female, at a time when any female can go through a confusing and distressing period, whatever their upbringing.'
