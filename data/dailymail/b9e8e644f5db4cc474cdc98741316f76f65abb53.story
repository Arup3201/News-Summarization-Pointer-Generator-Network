A teenage girl was crushed to death on Wednesday by a truck after falling under the wheels while sending a text message on her phone.

Noemi Mendez, 15, stumbled off the curb in Otay Mesa, California and fell under the back wheels of the large rig which was making a right turn.

The girl's older brother desperately tried to save his sister but she was crushed by the large vehicle and died at the scene.

Her 20-year-old brother Elias was also hit by the truck but was not injured in the tragic accident shortly after 5pm on Wednesday.

The driver of the rig, who has not been identified, will face no charges as he is not at fault, police said on Thursday.

Officers said that the girl had been 'distracted walking' - a troubling phenomenon where pedestrians are texting or playing on their phones and not paying enough attention to busy roads.

Miss Mendez was a sophomore student at Castle Park High School in Chula Vista.

Juan Mendez, 19, believed to be the teenager's boyfriend, posted a black ribbon on his Facebook page on Thursday.

Bobby Murillo, 17, who attended French class with the victim, told U-T San Diego: 'We lost a Trojan today', referring to the schoolâ€™s nickname, 'All her friends are devastated.'

The brother and sister had been walking along the road as their father repairs tires at a shop nearby. His colleagues are helping the devastated family to pay for the funeral.

A tribute of a small bouquet of yellow flowers and a pink balloon was left at the scene.
