The retrial has begun for a southern California attorney accused of attempting to frame a PTA volunteer by planting drugs in her car.

Kelli Peters cried hysterically on the stand today as she gave evidence against Kent Easter, 40, who sat stony-faced throughout the testimony. Peters was so emotional, the trial had to be cut short for the day.

Easter faces charges of false imprisonment by fraud or deceit and remains free on bail after a previous trial ended in November in a deadlock of 11 to one in favor of conviction.

Vendetta: Prosecutors say Easter and his wife Jill disliked Peters over an incident involving their son at school

If convicted, he faces a three-year prison sentence, reports ABC News. 

Prosecutors say that Easter made a 911 call in February 2011 claiming that Kelli Peters, a PTA volunteer at his son's school, appeared to be under the influence of drugs and that he saw her hide the drugs in her car.

Easter, of Irvine, planted prescription painkillers, marijuana and a marijuana pipe in Peters' car according to the district attorney's office. Easter was in constant contact with his wife, Jill Easter, by cellphone and text message as he did so, prosecutors said.

Police responded to the call, and found the drugs in Peters' car. She was interviewed for two hours but officers turned their attention to the Easters when they realized that the school volunteer was in class at the time Kent Easter accused her of hiding drugs in her car, authorities said.

Peters also vigorously denied knowledge of the drugs and a subsequent search of her home turned up no evidence of any other drug use.

Traumatic experience: Before the drug-planting incident, the Easters had tried to sue Peters and Jill Peters tried to take out a retraining order against her

Prosecutors say the Easters disliked Peters because they felt she didn't properly supervise their son.

Easter and his wife, also an attorney, had previously had a run-in with Peters when they sued her in March 2010 after she locked their son, then a first-grader, out of the school for less than 20 minutes, an act they said was intentional. The case was dismissed.

Jill Easter, 40, also requested a restraining order against Peters, claiming she was psychotic and unstable and tried to kill her. The request was denied.

A video surveillance camera captured Kent Easter calling Irvine police from a business center in a hotel near his legal office, prosecutors said.

Easter testified during his first trial that his wife became obsessed with getting the Peters fired as a volunteer from the school, reports OC Weekly.

His defense team claims that Easter was merely trying to please his wife, who was the mastermind of the plot.

Jill Easter pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 120 days in prison and 100 days of community service for her part in the incident. 

She is the author of a book called Holding House, under the pen name Ava Bjork, according to the Los Angeles Times.
