Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden warned Saturday that imposing a travel ban to the countries known to be dealing with an Ebola outbreak could make the problem worse, as it would cut off the affected areas from receiving necessary medical aid.

Such was the case recently in Liberia - where the Ebola death toll is nearing 3,500 people - when African Union aid workers were trying to get into the country, Frieden said.

'Their ability to get there was delayed by about a week because their flight was canceled and they were stuck in a neighboring country,' Frieden told a press conference Saturday, according to The Hill.

'In terms of the entry process, we really need to be clear that we don't inadvertently increase the risk to people in this country by making it harder for us to respond to the needs in those countries, by making it harder to get assistance in and therefore those outbreaks would become worse, go on longer, and paradoxically, something that we did to try and protect ourselves might actually increase our risk.'

'Sealing off the the country could make it worse': U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden said fighting the source of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa would be the best way to control it

Frieden believes the best way to control the outbreak of the deadly virus is to fight it from the source in West Africa, not stop people who may or may not be infected from coming into the country.

'Though we might wish we can seal ourselves off from the world, there are Americans who have the right of return and many other people that have the right to enter this country,' he said.

As the number of potential Ebola patients continues to rage in the United States, Frieden stressed there remains only one confirmed case - Thomas Eric Duncan in Dallas.

'We have definitely seen an increase in the number since this patient was diagnosed - that is as it should be,' Frieden said.

'We have already gotten well over 100 inquiries for possible patients - this one patient has tested positive.

'We expect we will see more rumors, concerns, possibilities of cases. Until there is a positive test that's what they are, rumors and concerns.'

Federal officials confirmed Saturday that the suspected Ebola patient at the District of Columbia's Howard University hospital did not have the disease, Fox News reported.

Similar scares in New Jersey and Washington D.C. also tested negative for Ebola.

Infected: Eric Thomas Duncan, the first confirmed case of Ebola in the United States, arrived in Dallas from Liberia on September 25. He was mistakenly turned away from a hospital before returning two days later via ambulance. Duncan is now reportedly in a critical condition

Duncan was mistakenly sent home by a Dallas hospital last week, even after telling doctors he had recently visted Liberia.

He returned via ambulance two days later and is now said to be in a crtical condition, according to Fox.

About 50 people in Texas have been marked as the most at-risk of contracting Ebola after coming into contact with Duncan, the CDC told The Washington Post.

Nine of them are considered high-risk, and four have been quarantined.
