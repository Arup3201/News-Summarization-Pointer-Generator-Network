The once-troubled Bahrain Grand Prix has reported record profits and growth in 2014 after switching to a night race.

The event was cancelled in 2011 after violent clashes between police and anti-government protesters.

It went ahead in 2012 despite calls for it to be cancelled in the wake of alleged human-rights abuses.

Ahead of the 10th anniversary of the grand prix last year, a decision was taken for the Bahrain International Circuit to become floodlit.

The response from the public was significant as the BIC increased F1 ticket revenues by 29% compared to 2013 on the back of its highest race-day attendance of 31,000.

The number of international visitors for the race also increased by 150% compared to 2013.

BIC chief executive Sheikh Salman bin Isa Al-Khalifa said: 'The success of our 10th anniversary year reflects the hard work not just over the last 12 months, but ever since the BIC opened its doors ten years ago, with a vision to put Bahrain on the map through motorsport.

'Our success in 2014 was not a one-off for the BIC. Our aim has always been to establish the circuit as a sustainable business in its own right and a place to grow grassroots racing as the home of motorsport in the Middle East.

'We continue to build and evolve that platform with the support of our partners and sponsors, with new initiatives such as the commercial development supporting that growth.

'We can therefore look forward to the next 10 years with some confidence.'
