The financial crisis engulfing the eurozone has driven tens of thousands more migrants into Britain.

The numbers arriving from countries worst-hit by the continent’s recession - such as Spain, Greece and Portugal - have leapt by as much as 50 per cent, official figures show.

The surge from southern Europe is a blow to ministers, whose efforts to cut migration have stalled.

David Cameron had pledged to reduce net 
migration – the number of new arrivals minus those leaving – to ‘tens of
 thousands’ by the next election.

However, latest figures suggest that while the Government is cutting the number coming in from outside the European Union, they are being replaced by migrants travelling within it.

EU free movement rules mean ministers are powerless to prevent migrant workers coming to Britain from the continent.

As a result, net migration rose last year
 from 153,000 to 176,000, ending five consecutive quarters of decreases.

This remains well below the levels seen in the 2000s, when net 
migration consistently reached 225,000.

Analysis shows fewer migrants were coming from Africa, India and Pakistan, while more arrived from southern Europe.

Experts have warned of a ‘lost generation’ of young Europeans unable to get jobs.

Unemployment among young Greeks reached 62.5 per cent last year while 56.4 per cent of young Spaniards and 40.5 per cent of young Italians are out of work.

Now data suggests many are turning to Britain, where the economy is bouncing back and unemployment is lower.

National Insurance figures for the year to March showed 50 per cent more Spaniards had registered to work in the UK. The figure for Greeks was up 44 per cent, while the number of Portuguese rose by 43 per cent.

The number of Germans – whose own economy is more robust – fell by 7 per cent. The eurozone crisis has left millions out of work, and prompted violent protests in response to austerity measures.

While both France and Germany saw economic growth last year, Spain and Italy are still in recession and the Greek economy is shrinking at nearly 5 per cent a year.

Immigration minister Mark Harper said: ‘Immigration from outside the EU is now at its lowest level for 14 years.

‘At the same time, there has been an increase in the number of sponsored student visa applications for our world-class universities, and an increase in the number of visas issued to skilled workers.’

He reiterated that the Government is ‘committed to bringing net migration down to the tens of thousands’.

The number of children born in the UK to Romanian mothers has reached a record high. It is now the ninth most common country of birth for Britain’s foreign mums, replacing China in the top ten, with 4,406 babies last year. Poland remained top, with 21,156.
