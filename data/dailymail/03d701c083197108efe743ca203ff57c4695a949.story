David Batt pretended to be homeless to scrounge money off generous shoppers while actually living in a £230,000 house

A beggar who pretended to be homeless so he could scrounge money from shoppers actually lived in a £230,000 village home, a court has heard.

David Batt, 34, would lay in doorways in Maidstone, Kent, pretending to be homeless so sympathetic shoppers would hand over their spare change.

But the man actually lives in a two-storey semi detached property worth £230,000 in an attractive village, a court was told.

Batt’s deceit was exposed when he appeared before Maidstone Magistrates' Court accused of begging for the third time in just nine months.

He was caught with £19 in small change on King Street in the town last month.

The man then gave his address as a housing association property in Yalding - which is around seven miles outside the town centre.

Batt pleaded guilty to begging in court today and was fined £35.

He was also ordered to pay £85 costs and a £20 victim surcharge.

Batt, who was convicted for begging in 
August and September last year, refused to comment on the latest 
addition to his criminal record.

Maidstone town centre manager Bill Moss said Batt was well known locally.

He said: 'This man is a habitual nuisance to residents, customers and workers in the town centre.

'He has spent many months begging and received huge sums of money from local people.

'This man sees begging as an easy way of making money.'

Mr. Moss added: 'The big disappointment is that the court has not dealt with him more seriously.

'A £35 fine will soon be afforded from money he will scrounge in a few short hours.'

Neighbour Brian McAuley, 49, today branded Batt a 'lazy git'.

He said: 'I always see him around, cycling on his bicycle. He doesn't look like he needs to beg for money - he looks absolutely fine.

'He lives with his mum and she must be at her wit's end.

'I think he's a lazy git and he should get a job. There's plenty of work in the farms around here.

'But he's obviously made a lifestyle choice to sponge off other people.'

Mike Fitzgerald, 76, the chairman of the Maidstone Day Centre for homeless people, said Batt was 'clearly a very good actor'.

He said: 'We are pleased that action has been taken against this man. It's a shame because people around here are very generous and this guy gives genuine homeless people a bad name.

'I've seen him begging before and I asked him why he wasn't going to the day centre. He claimed they didn't want him there, which I found strange.

'He was a very convincing homeless person because of the way he sat and acted. He's clearly a very good actor.'

On his Facebook page, Batt boasts about a trip to the hairdressers, saying: 'Had ma hair dun 2day in im well chuft wiv it'.

He is also pictured holding a rifle and riding a gleaming motorbike.

The man has appeared in court three times in the last nine months for begging. This time, he was fined £35 and ordered to pay additional court costs at Maidstone Magistrates' Court
