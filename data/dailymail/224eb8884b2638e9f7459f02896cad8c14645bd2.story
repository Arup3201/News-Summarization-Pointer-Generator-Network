These pictures show a scientist being savagely beaten up in the street by two drunken thugs after he dared to make friendly conversation with them   at the end of a night out.

CCTV images captured the moment Dr Dominic Henry, 32, paid a terrible price for engaging in small talk with strangers Alan Croydon and Arron Buckley as   he waited to get a cab home in Manchester city centre.

For no reason, Dr Henry was punched to the ground and then kicked and stamped on up to 15 times 'with deadly intent' as he lay defenceless on the   ground.

Attack: These pictures show the savage and unprovoked assault endured by a scientist in Manchester city centre in December

Blows raining down: Dr Dominic Henry was punched to the ground and then kicked and stamped on up to 15 times

The senior metallurgist, who works as a senior technical project leader for a chemical firm, was left with a badly bruised and swollen face and 'dips'   in his scalp.

He managed to get home and when his wife, an NHS manager, saw his beaten face she began crying.

He was admitted to hospital for a brain scan and later   feared he would lose his job after having to hold key meetings with global leading aerospace companies whilst nursing a black eye.

The victim now believes the streets of home city will always 'pose a danger beyond many expectations'.

In a statement Dr Henry - who works with Manchester Metropolitan University - said: 'Not being a small guy I naively felt I would be okay.

'I was   talking to them for a few minutes before they started punching. The fear began to build in me as one punched me from the side.Â 

Thug: Alan Croydon was locked away for 12 months after pleading guilty to assault occasioning actual body harm. Dr Dominic Henry said the sustained attack was 'terrifying'

'It felt surreal. Scary. I lay there while they kicked and stamped on my head. I   couldn't believe it. The attack was brutal, violent, beyond the scope of my imagination.

'I could not comprehend how another human being could be so vicious and with such deadly intent without any just cause. As the kicks and stamps reigned   down, thud thud thud, I wondered how long it would last.

'I could feel the pain on my hands, arms and head. I was scared. They really wanted to hurt and damage me. It was terrifying.

'Never did I think this would be part of our lives, having to go through tests including a CT scan felt intimidating. I was an innocent, hardworking   man that didn't deserve what I got.'

He added 
that he had felt 'embarrassed' about his injuries and that the events of
 the night had nearly taken away his successful career because his   
black eye had 'not looked good professionally'.

He
 added: 'I just want to feel confident again but worry that the streets 
of Manchester will always   pose a danger beyond many expectations.'

Dr
 Henry spoke out as Croydon, 25, from Manchester, was locked away for 12
 months after pleading guilty to assault occasioning actual body harm.

A
   warrant was issued with for Buckley, also 25, who has gone on the 
run.  The case comes as Inspector Ian Hanson, 47, of Greater Manchester 
Police said he himself would not go out in Manchester after midnight 
because it is   'too dangerous'.

Manchester
 Crown Court was told the unprovoked attack occurred last December after
 Dr Henry had been out socialising with friends at the Malmaison   Hotel
 and a bar the city's trendy Northern Quarter district.

The victim had work commitments the following morning and left early to hail a cab home but stopped when he came across Croydon, Buckley and a third man   loitering on a street corner.

They began talking to him and spoke briefly to them only for his heart to begin 'racing' when the thugs suddenly turned   on him.

Prosecuting, John Wilcox said: 'At first the conversation seemed to be pleasant enough. It clearly turned worse and then he was subject to the   initial punch by Croydon.

'His co-accused then got involved. He was kicked to the ground at which stage he says things became blurry. He could feel the punches to his head and   body.'

Out of the blue: The men were seen chatting amiably before Alan Croydon launched his vicious assault

The judge said that Croydon was 'very, very lucky' that his attack didn't seriously injure the scientist - or worse

He added that Croydon initially struck five times to his head and body whilst Buckley hit him ten times.

Mr Wilcox added: 'But to compound matters,   both returned to the victim and attacked him.'  The court heard that Croydon kicked the scientist a further three times before leaving the scene.

Dr Henry had to use a handkerchief to wipe the blood   from his lip before phoning his wife before making his way home and reporting it to the police the following day.

He added that although he returned to work the next day, his wife's work suffered and had also had an impact on her team.

The court heard Croydon had been drunk on brandy following an all-day drinking session. He was previously given a suspended sentence for a racially   aggravated public order offence in 2011 and was subject to a community order in 2012 for possession of cannabis.

Defence counsel Mr Steve Tettey said that his client had 'a reliance on alcohol' and added: 'There can be no dispute on the culpability. For Mr Henry   the psychological scars will remain long after his black eye heals.

'There is no good explanation for the defendant's conduct, the truth is he was so intoxicated, he had consumed over eight brandies having drunk   substantially during the day. He cannot recall the incident he was so intoxicated.'

But the judge Mr Recorder Charles Garside QC told Croydon: 'You took part in what appears to have been a completely unprovoked attack on a stranger in   Manchester city centre.

'It goes without saying this was in the hours of darkness, you struck the first blow and you and your confederate used shod feet and fists.

'This was a   sustained and repeated assault. You take a leading role in the attack and you used shod feet as a weapon.

'The really aggravating factor is having kicked him to the ground, left him lying in the pavement and starting to move away, you and another went back   and went kicking and stamping on him again.

'The thing that marks this assault out is the fact that you returned to a man who was dazed and unable to defend himself.

'You were very, very lucky that no greater harm was done.'

After the case Det Con Paul Wilde from Greater Manchester Police said: 'These two men viciously attacked an innocent man as he walked home after a   Christmas party.

'The CCTV clearly shows the ferocity of this attack and the man was very lucky to have walked away with minor injuries.

'Croydon and Buckley subjected   the man to an unprovoked and violent attack and such disgraceful acts will not be tolerated.'
