Tesco has shut down more than 2,000 user accounts for its online shopping site after a cache of e-mail addresses, passwords and voucher balances were dumped online.

Many thought the details on a popular text sharing site were a hoax until Twitter users said they had tested the combinations and they worked.

It is thought the list was drawn from previous security breaches and comprised victims who used the same password for Tesco.com - which was not hacked directly - and other, compromised sites.

A spokesman said the area of the site affected was for collecting and storing Clubcard points.

Every little hack: More than 2,000 e-mail addresses and passwords of Tesco online accounts were leaked on a popular text-sharing website. It is thought they were gleaned from other hacks and not Tesco itself

The hackers would have then tested e-mail and password combinations with Tesco and made a list of positive matches, it is believed.

The hack has reignited warnings by security experts for people to use a different password for every single online account which they use.

It is not the first time Tesco's online accounts have been compromised.

Almost
 exactly a year ago customers complained that vouchers worth hundreds of
 pounds had disappeared from their Clubcard accounts, raising the 
possibility that thieves hacked into the company's system.

The
 supermarket asked police to investigate claims that dozens of its 
customers' Clubcard accounts may have fallen victim to an online fraud, 
with some losing vouchers they accumulated over several years.

It is small scale compared to other hacks globally, however.

Last
 month the social networking app Snapchat was caught up in a major 
security breach which revealed 4.6 million usernames and phone numbers.

And in December, experts found two million Facebook account details on a server in the Netherlands after they were stolen by the Pony Botnet, a malicious software that infects PCs.

The list of 2,240 accounts, which has had more than 3,000 hits since it was uploaded on Tuesday, made reference to a tool called the Tesco 'account checker'.

The victims had their accounts deactivated by Tesco last night and it is thought a small number had store vouchers stolen.

Users had mostly small values of vouchers on their accounts but some had a balance of up to £89.

Any people who have had accounts 'compromised' will be offered replacement vouchers by Tesco, a spokesman said. He would not confirm what he meant by the word compromised.

Although Tesco was not hacked directly, some people have questioned whether its security measures were strong enough.

Tesco said it was 'urgently investigating' the situation.

A spokesman told MailOnline: ‘We take the security of our customers’ data extremely seriously and are urgently investigating these claims.

'We have contacted all customers who may have been affected and are committed to ensuring that none of them miss out as a result of this.

'We will issue replacement vouchers to the very small number who are affected.’

Tesco was also hit by theft of customer Clubcard points last year, when hundreds of people reported their loyalty cards had been accessed.
