Newt Gingrich's fond recollections of working under Ronald Reagan in the 1980s have been rubbished by a White House colleague who claims he was often extremely critical of the former president.

In several of his campaign speeches, Gingrich has alluded to his work with the 40th U.S. President, claiming 'we helped defeat the Soviet empire' and 'I helped Reagan create millions of jobs' among other achievements.

But Elliott Abrams, a former assistant secretary of state, said that rather than working side by side with Reagan, Gingrich was scathing about his plans to defeat Communism and often refused to support his decisions.

Not eye to eye: Newt Gingrich repeatedly insulted and disagreed with President Reagan, especially over his policy towards Soviet Russia, and insider has revealed

Claims: Former assistant secretary of state Elliott Abrams said Gingrich was often critical of Reagan's presidency and policies

Mr Abrams said that when Gingrich was first elected to Congress in 1978, the freshman members chose to attack Reagan as often as he voted for him.

Writing in the National Review, he describes a statement made by Gingrich on March 21, 1986, at the height of the Nicaraguan contras funding debate.

He quotes Gingrich: 'Measured against the scale and momentum of the Soviet empire's challenge, the Reagan administration has failed, is failing, and without a dramatic change in strategy will continue to fail... President Reagan is clearly failing.

'The burden of this failure frankly must be placed first on Ronald Reagan.'

In another bitter attack, he compared 
Reagan's meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as 'the most 
dangerous summit for the West since Adolf Hitler met with Neville 
Chamberlain in 1938 in Munich'.

He also criticised Reagan's delivery in speeches and claimed his policies towards the USSR were 'pathetic' and 'incompetent'.

Ultimately, Reagan's stance on the Soviet empire proved correct as the USSR collapsed in 1991.

Gingrich
reacted similarly to George W. Bush when he was making a decision on 
the surge in Iraq and facing opposition from top generals and other 
Republicans in 2008.

Critical: Gingrich, 69, pictured with his wife Callista, has used recollections of his time working under Reagan during his speeches

Main rival? Republican hopeful Mitt Romney at Miami-Dade College. The pair are neck-and-neck in polls in Florida ahead of the fourth primary on Tuesday

It comes after it emerged Gingrich and rival Mitt Romney are neck and neck in the fight for Florida.

Public
opinion polls have now put the two Republicans in a close contest and 
the winner of Tuesday's primary will be the first to claim a second 
victory in the race for the nomination.

The first three nominating contests, in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, have gone to three different candidates.

Gingrich,
a former House speaker, has tried to paint Romney as out-of-touch by 
highlighting bank accounts in Switzerland and the Cayman Islands.

Flashback: Reagan is pictured with Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987 as they sign the START treaty. Gingrich compared their first meeting to that of Adolf Hitler and Neville Chamberlain in 1938

Trailing: Rick Santorum and, right, Ron Paul, have very little presence in Florida and neither is expected to gain much support in the next primary

The 69-year-old himself has faced criticism over his remarks on President Bill Clinton's infidelity in the mid-1990s, at the same time as he was involved in an affair.

Rick Santorum, who won the first primary in Iowa, stands virtually no chance of winning the Florida caucus and has not planned any advertising in the state as he focuses on the Midwest.

Ron Paul, who has yet to win a primary, has also been virtually absent from the sunshine state expect for appearances at the two debates.
