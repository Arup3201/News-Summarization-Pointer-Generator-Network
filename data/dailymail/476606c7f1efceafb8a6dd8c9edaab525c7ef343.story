Legendary slugger Jose Canseco says he's thankful 'something worse' didn't happen during an accident Tuesday while cleaning a loaded gun, which discharged and blew the middle finger clean off his left hand.

The 50-year-old retired player was resting at home Wednesday following the incident, with doctors saying it is unlikely he will ever regain use of the digit.

'Got no sleep. Hope I can keep my finger but grateful it wasn't something worse,' he Tweeted.

Canseco, who held his heavily-wrapped hand up for the photo, is being looked after by his wife, Leila Knight, who called 911 following the accident at their Las Vegas home.

The incident occurred in the kitchen of the house at about 3pm Tuesday.

In an interview with The New York Daily News, Knight said her husband had been at a shooting range a few days earlier.

He then decided to clean the weapon but didn't realize it was still loaded.

'The middle finger was hanging by a thread, and I wrapped his hand in a towel and then called 911,' Knight told the newspaper.

'The doctors said they would either have to amputate or do reconstructive surgery.

'But if they do surgery, he won’t be able to use it again.

'He blew away an artery and a big bone chunk.'

Knight reiterated the situation could have been much worse, and that she could have been shot.

Canseco was in surgery until late Tuesday night. 

Records show that Canseco owns the home where the incident occurred.

The Cuban-American dominated the MLB with his hitting prowess in the 1980s, but later admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs for much of his career. 

Canseco is a right-handed batter who hit 462 career home runs and was a six-time All-Star. 

He also played for Texas, Boston, Toronto, Tampa Bay, the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox during a career that spanned from 1985 to 2001.
