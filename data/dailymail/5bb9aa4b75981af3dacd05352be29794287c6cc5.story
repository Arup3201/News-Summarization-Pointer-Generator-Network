The unfortunate teenager whose feet grew so big that he was barely able to walk successfully underwent surgery at a hospital in China.

Teenager Xiao Meng was born with a genetic condition that causes the feet to swell abnormally - meaning he cannot wear shoes.

The 14-year-old, dubbed Hobbit Boy by schoolmates, is pictured here having his feet measured by doctors at Shanghai Children's Hospital ahead of the treatment.

The 14-year-old's feet had grown so large that he was no longer able to wear shoes and could barely walk

Following the operation doctors said that his left foot is expected to recover fully but that his right foot will require further treatment.

Speaking to reporters, Xiao said: 'I wish I could wear shoes like my classmates. I wish i could run fast like they do. I wish I go everywhere I want.'

Xiao's family were too poor to pay for treatment and, as a result, his feet have grown bigger and bigger with age.

The hospital has pledged to carry out the operation and subsequent care for free, following a campaign launched by his school teachers that was supported by the Chinese media.

Xiao rests in bed before going for treatment. He told reporters before the surgery: 'I wish I could wear shoes like my classmates. I wish i could run fast like they do.'

His family have also received thousands of pounds towards his care as a result of the campaign.

A team of doctors can be seen making marks on Xiao's feet before the operation.

The medics first cut away the excess growths from his feet before allowing six months of recovery time.

Xiao will now undergo physiotherapy to learn how to use his newly trimmed feet.

Speaking
 earlier this week, his father Meng Zhaoguang, said: 'We're an ordinary 
family and it breaks my heart to see him suffer but we have no money for
 medicine.'

Xiao described his melancholy at not being able to join his friends as they play games.

He said: 'I like school but it hurts to walk and I can't go quickly or join in many games. Children sometimes call me names but they don't mean to be cruel.'

But, after appearing in local media, well-wishers donated thousands of pounds towards medical fees.

Before the operation one of the doctors, Tang Yujin, said: 'We can treat the condition and when that is stable we plan to reduce the size of his feet so they look and feel more normal.'
