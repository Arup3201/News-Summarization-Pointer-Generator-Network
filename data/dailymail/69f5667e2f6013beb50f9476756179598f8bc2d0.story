Sir Elton John, who has generously donated funds raised from his single Candle In The Wind to charity, with Princess Diana in 1993

Sales of Candle In The Wind, the song performed by Sir Elton John at the Princess of Wales’s funeral, raised an incredible £38 million for charity.

The star’s performance moved mourners and millions watching the service on TV and became the fastest-selling single in history. The recording sold more than 33 million copies.

Sir Elton generously donated his royalties to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund.

It will close on New Year’s Eve having raised a total of £138 million, money that has been used to fund more than 400 projects close to Diana’s heart.

The Princess was famed for her charity work, particularly raising the plight of AIDS victims. She also campaigned for a ban on landmines during a high-profile visit to Angola.

John Bechard, the memorial fund’s accountant, said: ‘When Diana died there were thousands of donations pouring in, but they were mostly around the £5 and £10 mark.

'The proceeds from Candle In The Wind gave us a remarkable chunk of money which massively raised the fund’s profile, triggering a snowball effect. We are indebted to Sir Elton for his generosity.’

Ownership of the fund will now pass to the charitable foundation set up for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge  and Prince Harry.
