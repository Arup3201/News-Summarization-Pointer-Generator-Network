A range of rude number of plates that use letters and numbers to spell out words such as penis and orgasm have been put up for sale for thousands of pounds each.

The cheeky plates include the indiscreet 'PEN15' - on sale for a staggering a £90,000.

But the rude registration is not even the most expensive in the range.

Rude: Drivers wanting to purchase the registration ORG 45M will have to fork out £135,000

Expensive: The set of rude number plates is being sold by regtransfers.co.uk. PEN 15 is being sold for £90,000

Drivers who would like the registration 'ORG45M' displayed on their car will have to fork out £135,000.

Other number plates in the collection include 'BO11LOX', costing £22,650.

The registration 'LUS 73D' - reminiscent of the word 'Lusted' - is even selling for £13,650.

The plates are being sold by regtransfers.co.uk, who insist that they are legal despite licensing rules that say inappropriate combinations can be removed.

The website's Angela Banh said: 'There is actually nothing rude or inappropriate about it, it’s just the way that it is interpreted by some.

'Obviously, there are connotations associated with the plate, but 
arguably, it has become something of a modern day antique and in 
addition to providing hours of conversations and joviality, the PEN 15 
plate is also a wise investment.'

Although the rude range is being made available to the public, the DVLA often 'suppresses' number plates that may cause offence.

Banned: Alan Clarke from Chesterfield, was instructed by the DVLA to remove the plate 'BO11 LUX' from his Range Rover last year, just six weeks after he had bought it for £399

Plates that have been banned by the organisation include, MU12DER, PE12ADO and PE12VRT.

A DVLA panel decides what number and letter combinations may cause offence before plates are issued and offending combinations are then withheld from circulation.

Banned plates can include combinations clearly bearing a resemblance to offensive terms, including HE12 OIN, NA12 ZEE and DR12 UGS.

But the agency's decision to ban more trivial combinations has left some perplexed.

In 2007, number plates in Scotland bearing the sequence SN07 were banned for being offensive, as the sequence could bear a resemblance to the word 'snot'.

Alan Clarke, from Chesterfield, was 
instructed to remove a plate from his vehicle last year, just six weeks 
after he had bought it.

Clarke
had spent £399 on the 'BO11 LUX' plate for his new Range Rover, but 
soon received a stern letter from the DVLA telling him the plate was 
'causing offence' and ordering him to remove it.

Cheeky: Car-owners will have to spend £9,000 for this number plate

Many number plates, including PEN15, were issued by local authorities before the DVLA came into existence.

If the agency receives a complaint about such a plate, a review can be launched as to whether it is appropriate.

A DVLA Spokesperson said: 'DVLA regularly reviews the appropriateness of registration numbers as society changes.  Our policy in respect of withholding registration numbers is clear.

'They are withheld in instances where if displayed on a number plate they are likely to cause general offence or embarrassment.  The reasons can be on the grounds of political, racial and religious sensitivities or simply that they are regarded as being in poor taste.

'If we are made aware that a previously issued number is deemed offensive,  we would consider withdrawing the number.'
