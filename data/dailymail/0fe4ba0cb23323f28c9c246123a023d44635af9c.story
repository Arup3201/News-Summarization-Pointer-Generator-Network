A plane was left standing on its nose today after a pilot crash-landed into a field just feet from a row of houses.

The pilot and his daughter, who was a passenger in the aircraft, managed to escape the wreckage shortly after he performed the emergency landing in Haselau, northern Germany.

The pair both suffered minor injuries.

The plane came to rest against a power box and a lamppost after it was guided to the ground.

Emergency services were then confronted by the bizarre sight of the plane standing upright on its nose when they responded to calls from locals.

It is believed strong winds had blown the plane over and fire crews had to tie it to stop it being blown back.

Local media say the plane suffered technical problems during the flight, which forced the amateur pilot to make the emergency landing, according to Die Welt.

Neither the pilot or the passenger were seriously injured in the crash

After walking from the wreckage, the 
52-year-old then went into shock and was taken to the University 
Hospital Eppendorf in Hamburg.

His 23-year-old daughter escaped with bruising and is also being treated in hospital.

Emergency services cordoned off the plane and fixed it to the ground before it could be taken away.
