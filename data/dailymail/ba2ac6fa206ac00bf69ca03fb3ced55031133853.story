Children can now build their own drug dens with a shocking new play kit inspired by TV show Breaking Bad.

The sell-out £160 kit, branded 'SuperLab', lets any child or adult recreate Walter White's notorious crystal meth lab.

Complete with protective masks, drug paraphernalia, figurines and a version of the car from the show, infants can even reenact scenes from the series.

The toy looks similar to a classic Lego set, although it is not connected to the Danish company in any way and was made by a separate firm.

'Bricking Bad' allows children - or adults - to construct the industrial meth lab set up by Walter White and drug boss Gustavo Fring

The 500-brick set, made by Citizen Brick in the United States, comes complete with figures of the main characters and enables you to build the entire meth lab

Outraged commentators took to Twitter to speak out against the bizarre toy.

Jeff Myers tweeted: 'Made for children raised by parents who should know better.'

Jacques Gonzales added: 'Definitely not for kiddies!'

The drama, in its fifth and final series, follows chemistry teacher Walter White on his journey to raise money for his family's future when he is diagnosed with lung cancer.

The schemer from Albuquerque, played by Bryan Cranston, enlists the help of a former pupil Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul.

A global hit, it is hailed by critics and watched by millions around the world.

The £160 kit has already sold out online. The American show has a wealth of underage viewers worldwide

But Lego Group refused to sanction the merchandise, produced by Citizen Brick, because of its 'adult content'.

Beneath the sold-out item, the Citizen Brick website told customers: 'Soothe yourself with the Citizen Brick Superlab Playset.

'Who knows what fun you’ll cook up with this deluxe set, chock full of realistic details, and three exclusive minifigs! Over 500 parts!

Lego refused to sanction the play set because of the 'adult content' available to people of any age

'This set is a product of Citizen Brick, and is not sponsored, authorized or endorsed by the LEGO Group, owners of the registered LEGO(R) trademark.'

Interest in the series is rife among under-age viewers, with one pair of children screening their own version on YouTube last month.

Rather than Class As, the Breaking Bad Jr stars deal in Jelly Beans, and the star suffers from diabetes instead of cancer.
