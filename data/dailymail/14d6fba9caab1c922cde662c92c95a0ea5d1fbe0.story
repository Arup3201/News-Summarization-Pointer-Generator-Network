She's a pistol! Jennifer Ullery, 40, has been arrested and charged with firing a rifle at a TV in front of her three children 

A suburban Chicago woman was arrested after police say she grabbed a rifle and shot at her flat-screen television because she was mad her children were watching too much TV.

Jennifer Ullery, a mother of three from Algonquin, pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of aggravated reckless discharge of a firearm, possession of a firearm without a firearm owner ID card and three counts of child endangerment in connection to the incident that took place back in January.

Police learned of the shooting about a month later and responded to the Ullery family's home on Talaga Drive February 9 to investigate.

Inside, responding officers said they found a 50-inch Panasonic TV with its screen shattered.

Police also recovered a Ruger .22-caliber rifle, which they believe Ullery used to fire at the device, reported Northwest Herald. 

When interviewed by police, the 40-year-old mother admitted she was upset with her three children - ages 6, 11 and 15 - for indulging in TV-watching.

She said she also did not like the program that was on January 20 - a music video by the rock band Primus.

Algonquin Deputy Police Chief Andrew Doles said Ullery fired multiple shots at the TV screen as her children were sitting on the couch.

Evidence: Police responded to the Ullery family's home in Algonquin, Illinois, where they found a 50-inch Panasonic flat-screen TV with its screen shattered 

Jenny, get your gun! Police say Ullery grabbed a Ruger .22-caliber rifle (similar to the one pictured in file photo) and squeezed off several rounds 

Following her arrest, the children were placed in the custody of a relative. Ullery was released from jail after posting $1,500 bail. She is due back in court April 20.

Algonquin police said they were familiar with the Ullery family from past encounters involving domestic violence claims and custody disputes.

Officers were called to the family's home twice in January, and in March 2014 the woman’s estranged husband, 31-year-old Daniel Ullery, was arrested on domestic battery charges.

Acquired taste: Ullery told police she didn't like it that her kids, ages 6, 11, and 15, were watching a music video by the rock band Primus (pictured)
