A brain-damaged boy whose parents had asked doctors to turn off his breathing-support has now undergone a possible life-saving surgery after being sponsored by a charity.

Xiong Junyi, from Anhui, east China, suffered severe brain damage in an accident at his father's workplace, when he got stuck on a mail delivery conveyor belt.

His parents Zhengqing, 35, and Guangqun, 33, were unable to pay for the care of the sick toddler, so had asked medical staff to take him off life support.

Saved: Xiong Junyi was severely brain damaged in an accident at his father's place of work and unable to afford the right care for him, his parents wanted to turn off his life support

However, after an unnamed local charity heard about the family's plight, they stepped in to cover the cost of life-saving brain surgery and aftercare for Xiong. 

The 18-month-old's parents had taken him to visit his father at work at a courier firm in the Hekou township in Huoqiu county in central China's Henan province on December 1st last year.

Xiong somehow ended up getting trapped in a conveyor belt used to deliver parcels, leaving him horrifically injured and on life support in the local hospital.

Xiong was in the hospital in Anhui for over a month after the accident, and was not able to move or talk. He also had difficulty swallowing and breathing after being discharged.

His parents applied for his life support to be switched off, as they were unable to afford proper care for him, which would lead to him slowly dying in severe pain.

New beginning: The story of Xiong's accident and his parents heartbreaking choice  attracted international attention and after a charity stepped in to help, he successfully underwent brain surgery in Shanghai

Their request was rejected by the local civil affairs bureau because euthanasia is illegal in China.

However Xiong's story attracted international attention and after a charity stepped in to help, he successfully underwent brain surgery at the Children's Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai last week.

Dr Li Hao, director of the children hospital's neurosurgery department, said that the follow-up rehabilitation will need a good deal of time, energy and money, and that they were optimistic the boy would have a chance of recovery, although it was still unclear to what degree.

He said: 'We can't promise how well he can recover. The best result would be that he can take care of himself in the future.'

The boy's father told Shanghai Daily: 'The thought of euthanasia came about because we could see no solution and couldn't bear to see our son suffer every day.'

He said: 'We knew that many people would condemn us when they realised that we wanted to ask permission for our son to die, and two-months-ago I would have also said it was unthinkable whatever the circumstances.

A mother's love: The toddler's parents saw no other way out when they asked for doctor's to let him die

No choice: Guangqun and her husband's request was rejected  because euthanasia is illegal in China

'But the counterpoint as a parent is whether it's just as unthinkable to see so much suffering continue with someone you love.

'Our son was lying in intensive care and the doctor said that because of the massive brain damage he suffered, there was no chance of a proper recovery. When he finally woke up he couldn't even feed himself, and all he can do is breathe unaided.

'We could not even afford the drips to feed him after the money ran out, and are having to inject milk directly into his stomach to keep him alive.'

They said that they had run up massive debts and that after taking the boy home it was a living nightmare watching their child struggling for every breath.

Zhengqing said earlier: 'His eyes were rolling around inside his head because of the effort of breathing, and the doctors have confirmed the diagnosis that there is no chance he will get any better.'

But after the charity came forward and offered to help, he said: 'This hospital is one of the best in the country and we will work with doctors in any way we can to help our boy. Now at least there is hope.'
