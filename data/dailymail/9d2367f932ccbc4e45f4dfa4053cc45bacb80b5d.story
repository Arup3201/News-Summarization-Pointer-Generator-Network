The barbaric practice of flattening girls' chests to disguise their sexual development has spread from Africa to the UK, women's campaigners warned today.

Girls as young as 10 are having their breasts pounded with hot irons, often by their mothers, to hide the signs of puberty and so protect them against rape and unwanted pregnancy.

A traditional practice in Cameroon, experts are now warning that it has spread to Britain where it is being practised behind closed doors in families of Cameroonian extraction.

The practice of breast-ironing pubescent Cameroonian girls is said to have spread to Britain - their mothers want to delay sexual advances on their daughters so they can get an education (file picture)

Today women's charity CAMEWomen's and Girls' Development Organisation (CAWOGIDO) is holding a conference in London on the painful, unpleasant and often dangerous custom.

The charity's Margaret Nyuydzewira said breast-ironing, as it is known, is often used when a girl's breast develop early, and is done in private, between the girl and her mother.

'Of course it's happening in the UK, but like everywhere else, no-one wants to talk about it,' she said.

Ms Nyuydzewira told MailOnline: 'I am an African woman living in a Cameroonian community in London and it is happening in my community but no-one talks about it.

'Mothers are doing it to their daughters and telling them it is for their own good, because they believe that.

'Their daughters are not reporting it so no-one talks about it.'

She said the practice, which is not illegal in Cameroon, was happening 'behind closed doors' in the UK and needed to be stopped before it became widespread.

Cameroonian women: The custom of breast-ironing is said to be practised by mothers on their daughters

She said: 'It is harmful, but we are told it is a cultural practice.  This is what they said about female genital mutilation (FGM) at first, but now it is admitted that that is wrong.  We need the same to happen for breast-ironing'

Ms Nyuydzewira said she was contacted by a police officer who arrested a woman for breast-ironing her daughter.

She said: 'There was a discussion of the laws were and she was released in the end because it was a cultural practice, but I say if it harms kids then it should be against the law.'

The Association of Chief Police Officers
(ACPO) said the practice was known to them, and that any reports of it 
would be treated as a form of child abuse and passed to the Crown 
Prosecution Service so a case could be built.

As well as being excruciatingly painful, breast-ironing can cause problems including burns, abscesses, an inability to breastfeed, cysts and permanent disfigurement.

Britain's Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, says it is 'only a matter of time' before a prosecution over female genital mutilation is brought

It also damages the girl's confidence.

The campaigner added: 'I have seen girls become shy and withdrawn because of it.  They are too afraid to get undressed in front of anyone because they have been so disfigured.'

There are more than 200 ethnic groups in Cameroon with different customs, but all of them are said practise breast-ironing, using hot objects including stones or coconut shells.

The aim is to make the girls less desirable to men, and thereby protect them from unwanted sexual advances, disease or even pregnancy.

In a country where marriage at 13 is common, mothers mutilate their daughters to give them a chance of studying for longer.

The UN, which estimates that 3.8m pubescent girls are affected by the custom, says the practice is more common in the Christian and animist south of Cameroon than in the Muslim north, because Christian mothers are keener to see their daughters educated before they are married off.

Female genital mutilation (FGM), or female circumsion, in which a young girl's clitoris is cut off because it gives sexual pleasure, is illegal in the UK but affects thousands of young girls here, according to research.

One report said 2,000 girls had sought help at London hospitals in just three years after undergoing FGM.

A practice associated with communities in Africa, particularly Mali, Somalia, Sudan and Kenya, its defenders say it is a cultural ritual.  But it leaves young girls in pain, disfigured, open to infection and unable to enjoy sex.

Earlier this month Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said it was 'only a matter of time' before a prosecution was brought for FGM.

'I think a prosecution is much closer now than it's been at any stage since this was made a criminal offence in this country,' he said.
