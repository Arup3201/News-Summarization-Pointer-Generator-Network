Big occasions at Anfield always mean The Kop is fully decorated and Liverpool's return to Champions League combat was no exception.

From the banner that was unfurled shortly before the teams emerged before kick-off declaring, in bold red lettering, 'We Are Liverpool' to the image of Brendan Rodgers simply proclaiming 'Boss', there were nods to the characters that have shaped the club's history.

Hanging in the far corner of one of football's most famous stands, however, another took the eye. First given an airing during Saturday's limp 1-0 defeat against Aston Villa, this flag had a profound message in Italian about one of the current squad.

'Non ho nulla di dichiarare tranne il mio genio,' were the stated words next to a picture of Mario Balotelli.

Translated, you will discover it is one of Oscar Wilde's most famous quotations, 'I have nothing to declare except my genius'. No matter that he had yet to complete 90 minutes for Liverpool, here was evidence of how swiftly Balotelli has been welcomed.

Liverpool supporters are desperate for him to succeed. With memories of Luis Suarez beginning to fade, there is a position for someone to come in and make themselves the new darling of this ground and Steven Gerrard explained the opening that is there for Balotelli. 

'I hope he goes for it because it will be the making of him,' Gerrard said recently. I' have told him that. It was the first conversation I had with him. I told him 'Mario, it's there for you'. I told him to think of the names that have gone before and how he can uphold the tradition of top strikers here.

'We either produce them or find them. This is his chance. If I was in his position, at 24 years of age, I'd go and grab it with both hands. I'd sacrifice everything I could to grab it. If I was him I'd think 'I want to goals, medals, big European night from my Liverpool career'. It's all there for him.'

That may be so but, before this game, his career on Merseyside has yet to take flight. If there was some initial promise in the 3-0 win at Tottenham, there was a stall against Aston Villa. Having been ill in the build-up, he was substituted after a limp display.

What, then, would he follow up with?

With Anfield expecting to take advantage of their most inviting assignment of Group B – a home date against Bulgarian novices – Balotelli had a gilt-edged opportunity to start repaying the faith Brendan Rodgers has shown in him.

Much like his team, though, he found it hard to get going. His first significant passage of play was a run away from goal in the 13th minute but he couldn't find the space to shoot, as two Ludogrets defenders swarmed all over him.

A first sight of goal arrived a few moments later but Aleksander Aleksandrov was alert and thundered in with a challenge to divert his shot. Similar frustration followed in the 34th minute when, after creating an opening, a right-footed drive was comfortably gathered by Milan Borjan.

He jogged around and tried to get involved. He shouted at the match officials when things never went his way but there was never the feeling that Balotelli, a Champions League winner in his youth with Inter Milan, was waiting to cast a spell in front of goal.

Then it all changed. Just as nerves were beginning to fray and Ludogrets started to sense an improbable result, Balotelli did what all the A-list performers do and came up with the goal to crack the tension. It was a fine finish too, showing poise under pressure.

How his new crowd loved it, serenading him with the song 'Mario fantastico! Mario Magnifico! Ole, ole! Ole, ole!' If much of what had gone before was unconvincing, it no longer mattered. Balotelli was up and running.

A word of warning, though: for him to really become a success, he must work. He has to cover ground and make himself a nuisance and realise it is demanded that a Liverpool forward run himself to a standstill. All the greats did it. They all knew that hard work was a prerequisite.

The system Rodgers plays demands a high tempo and for his players to press. That is when they are at the best and when the chances come. If nobody is doing that up front, the system fragments and Liverpool's potency suffers.

Balotelli has the stage and the banner in homage to him on The Kop shows how much the locals want him to succeed. The big question is how much Balotelli wants to make it happen.
