Rangers have confirmed that the so-called Three Bears have snapped up Laxey Partners' 16 per cent share in the club.

In a statement to the Stock Exchange on Friday morning, the club welcomed the development which sees George Taylor, George Letham and Douglas Park purchase the stake of the Isle of Man hedge fund earlier this week.

It stated: 'The Company has been informed that on 31 December 2014, George Taylor, Douglas Park and George Letham acquired 5,000,000, 5,000,000 and 3,299,415 ordinary shares of 1p each respectively, representing 6.14 per cent, 6.14 per cent and 4.05 per cent of issued share capital. A DTR announcement is expected to follow in due course.

'The Board of Rangers is delighted that George Taylor, an existing Significant Shareholder, and George Letham, who provided the Company with a credit facility in 2014, together with Douglas Park have demonstrated their commitment to the Company through this purchase. The Directors welcome their continued enthusiasm towards contributing to the future success of the Company and club.'

In a separate announcement, the club confirmed that Lewis Macleod's transfer to Brentford – believed to be an initial £800,000 – will go towards paying ongoing costs before a more viable financial structure can be found.

It read: 'The Board of Rangers announces that on 30 December 2014 Rangers Football Club entered into an agreement to sell a player, Lewis Macleod. The proceeds of the sale will be used for immediate working capital needs during the next few weeks while the directors, in consultation with the Company's major shareholders and third parties, seek a long term and stable financial solution for the club.'

However, the future of the club could still depend on whether Mike Ashley is allowed to tighten his iron grasp on the Glasgow giants.

Rangers are desperately short of money and need to raise £8.3m before April 1 if they are to stay afloat.

While the Three Bears are now positioning themselves to ride to Rangers' rescue, they may find opposition from Ashley.

The Sports Direct businessman owns an 8.92 per cent stake in Rangers and controls the Glasgow giants' retail division. But the £3m emergency loan he handed the board late last year has effectively given him control of the club.

He has already placed former Newcastle managing director Derek Llambias on the board and named him chief executive - and still holds the right to pick a second director.

However, the Scottish Football Association has already blocked Ashley's attempt to raise his stake to 29.9 per cent after ruling it would breach 'dual ownership' regulations.

Ashley's next move, however, could prove crucial to the club's future.

Motor group boss Park has had his wealth previously estimated at £78m, while Letham - who sits on the board of the Rangers Supporters Trust (RST) - has already loaned the club £1m earlier this year.

Taylor, meanwhile, bought a 3.2 per cent stake in the club last month - meaning the consortium is now in control of 19.5 per cent of Rangers.

The trio have already lodged a £6.5m offer to underwrite a share issue with the club's board. In return, they want two seats on the Rangers board.

Wednesday's transaction will not see any cash flow into Rangers' coffers but it will allow the Three Bears to participate directly in any share issue taking place early in the new year.

Mike Ashley's plans to take further control at Rangers have been stymied by SFA rules on dual interest

A motion at last month's AGM which would have allowed the club to raise new shares and offer them to new investors before existing shareholders was controversially defeated.

Meanwhile, supporter groups say the latest developments in the Ibrox power struggle have sparked an increase in interest from supporters backing fan-ownership schemes.

A spokesman for the RST - who run BuyRangers - said: 'We've had an amazing response. We've seen new life members and existing members signing up for shares as well as new members who hold shares handing them to the RST.'

Organisers of Rangers First say they have seen more than 100 new fans sign up since the Three Bears made their move.

A spokesman said they had seen a 'significant uptake in Rangers First memberships as fans look to do their bit to support the actions of others'.
