It may be a toy for children but one adult Lego addict has spent £10,000 funding his obsession with the building blocks.

An entire room in Robert Clarkson's home is dedicated to the toy bricks and the father-of-two spends two hours a day on his hobby.

He has spent thousands of pounds buying about 50,000 pieces to make intricate Lego models such as a football stadium packed with 250 fans and 22 Lego players.

Other models , which can take months to make, include The Beatles' Yellow Submarine, steeplejack Fred Dibnah's steam engine Betsy and scenes from Bill and Ben and Rapunzel.

Mr Clarkson, 55, of Breighmet in Bolton, even built a Lego version of actress Tippi Hedron being menaced by crows in Alfred Hitchcock's movie The Birds.

Such is Mr Clarkson's dedication to his hobby that his creations are put on display to fellow Lego enthusiasts across the country.

But he said he could not do it without the support of his wife Sandra, 50.

He said: 'Tolerant is the word to describe my wife when it comes to Lego - and also patient and persistent.

'We
 have a rule in the house that I have one room for Lego. I have seen 
homes where there is Lego all over the house and it is nice in a geeky 
way but you still want it to be a family house.

'She'll
 be the first to give her opinion on my latest model, which I encourage -
 although she can be quite critical.

'If I think I can do something 
better or even improve an existing model, I'll break up and start again 
because I need the pieces.

'Some
 people glue their bricks together for stability, but that's not an 
option for me - it can be a very expensive hobby, so I have to recycle 
and reuse the pieces.'

Mr Clarkson said he took up his favourite childhood pastime again in a bid to stave off boredom after he left his NHS job as a nurse.

He said: 'I was a fan of Dr Who and tried to make the Dalek Robot. I loved the fact you could build something then break it all up and start on something else.

'But then I went into the "dark ages" of Lego - life got in the way. I lost touch with it as I focused on work, love and family. I met my wife, while I was studying to be a mental health nurse, we got married and had our two children.'

Mr Clarkson said adulthood took him into the 'dark ages' of Lego but his love of the toy was rekindled when he had his two children

It was when his children Laura, now 26, and Alexander, now 22, were born that he started playing with Lego once more.

He said: 'I got right back into it when the kids were growing up, helping them build toys.

'I remember my wife was toy shopping for the kids and she came across a Lego helicopter which she thought I'd like. It lit up and made noises and everything - she bought it to me as a Christmas present and doesn't she regret it now.

'The children finally grew up and went into their own "dark ages" but I continued on.'

Mr Clarkson is a member of the adult Lego fan club the Brickish Association and exhibits his work across the UK.

To save money on blocks Mr Clarkson's photographs the model, like this one of Fred Dibnah's steam engine Betsy, before breaking it up and starting on a new project

Mr Clarkson, pictured with a model of the cable car from the film Where Eagles Dare, said he loves to share his creations with fellow Lego enthusiasts

He said: 'By joining and attending events, other fans gave me the motivation to continue making more models.

'I enjoy the creativity of Lego - coming up with new ideas and putting them into reality - and overcoming technical obstacles to make it work along the way.

'It's about making it work aesthetically and finding solutions to any problems which crop up. I worked for the NHS for more than 30 years and it is totally different from my job.

'It's amazing 
seeing adults and children smiling and enjoying the aesthetics of my 
creations and that spurs me on every time to come back with something 
bigger and better each time.'

Mr Clarkson will be showcase his Lego work at the Northern Modelling Exhibition at EventCity in Manchester on Saturday and Sunday, March 2 and 3.
