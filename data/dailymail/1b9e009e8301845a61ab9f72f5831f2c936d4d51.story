Beloved: West Virginia science teacher David Foggin (picture) was suspended from his job last week after posting a homophobic rant on Facebook. However, most of his students have voiced their support of him and his statements

A high school teacher was suspended from his position last week after writing a homophobic rant on Facebook.

David Foggin was put on suspension last week after posting an advertisement for a meeting of Parkersburg South High School's gay-straight alliance club on his Facebook, including the following typo-laden comment:

'Club meeting at PSHS. Rally around them and show ur support. We are also considering a drunks-t totaller club, drugged/sober club, smokeless tobacco v smokes club, street racing, and deer poaching clubs. Please donate and support us. Thank u!!! I think I hear the drag already zinging'

Mr Foggin was put on suspension after high school administrators found out about the post, but he'll likely return to the classroom soon. The students go on spring break next week, and the school board is set to review the suspension after that to decide whether the suspension is paid or unpaid.

'It will be until spring break. He's not in the classroom this week,' Wood County Schools Superintendent Pat Law said. 'That's up to the board as to whether to approve it or not.'

The incident is still under investigation.

'Our main concern here is our students and student rights,' Board of Education President Tim Yeater added, 'but we also have a vested interest in our employee rights.'

However, many Parkersburg students are outraged Mr Foggin was suspended than offended by the comments he made on Facebook.

Last Friday morning, a large crowd of students, parents and other community members gathered outside the school to voice their support of Mr Foggin.

Less than a dozen turned out to speak out against the homophobic rant.

'This is stupid. He got suspended for no good reason,' one student told WTAP.

'It's all about his personality. If you actually knew him, you wouldn't be offended by that,' another student added.

The minority: A small group of less than 12 turned out to protest against the teacher on Friday

Many held up signs reading 'Freedom of Speech' and 'We Love Foggin' while others wore orange t-shirts with 'Team Foggin' emblazoned on them.

Even openly gay students came out to support the suspended science teacher.

'I'm gay myself and I didn't see the problem with it, half the gay kids in this school don't see a problem with it,' one student said.

However, a small minority of students did turn out calling for Mr Foggin's dismissal. 

'I'm standing up for the kids in the school that are afraid. I think if he apologized it would be a lot better,' one student said.  'I feel if he gets fired, everyone that is gay or bi-sexual would feel a lot better.'

Following his suspension last week, Mr Foggin responded with another comment on Facebook.

'I love everyone and I promote fairness and equality. I have difficulty with favoritism and bias given any person or group,' he wrote, adding that he planned to run for sheriff of Wood County in 2020.

'Thanks to all of u who promote equality and protection of the 1st amendment. PS....THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE 2ND AMENDMENT!!! To make sure it stays that way.

'Love u all. Get a concealed carry permit while u still can. Protect urself and ur family. Thanks God for every breath he gives you,' Mr Foggin wrote.

In addition to teaching science, Mr Foggin owns a side business selling guns and ammunition in Belleville, West Virginia.

He also issued a statement to West Virginia Public Broadcasting, saying he loves his students and his stance was simply on 'equality and fair treatment'.

'If a student need someone to turn to for any situation they face in their life, I hope they know the staff at PSHS is always there for them. I also feel their parents/guardians should be aware they are seeking guidance and they maybe trained, licensed counselors should be involved,' he said.
