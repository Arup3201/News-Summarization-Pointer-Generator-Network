These shocking photos show how a young woman's life has been ruined by snorting a powerful party drug as she escaped jail over a drunken knife attack.

Mikaila Tyhurst, 28, had once been an attractive blonde with clear skin, good teeth and a career plan to become an air hostess at the age of 18. 

But after becoming hooked on the former legal high GBL in 2009, she suffered severe liver damage and ended up on life support 15 times, claiming she had been treated like a 'rag doll' by a string of men.

During her addiction, her skin became blotchy and covered in spots, her eyes grew puffy and her hair turned a mousey shade of brown. Meanwhile, her front teeth were knocked out when she fell over during one drug-fuelled night and  her 18-month-old daughter was taken away from her.

Last March Tyhurst from Crumpsall, Manchester, went public about her addiction and claimed she had been off the drug for two years - and was determined to turn her life around and help others for the sake of her young daughter. She had been on a detox programme and was hoping to undergo a liver transplant.

But on Monday she pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual body harm, possession of a knife and theft after she and two accomplices left a man seriously injured with three knife wounds during a feud at his home in Padiham,  Lancashire.

Judge Andrew Woolman said Tyhurst had turned to drugs because of the 'sustained abuse' she had suffered at the hands of men

Tyhurst could have been jailed but Judge Andrew Woolman gave her an 18 month suspended jail term instead after hearing the appalling and sustained abuse of which she had been a victim.

Judge Andrew Woolman told her: 'I have read the pre-sentence report but the bold print does not reveal the full horror of your own life. Your adult life can only be described by sustained abuse at the hands of men.

'You had an appalling time and it led you to drug abuse. These facts allow me to take an exceptional course for what you have done.'

Tyhurst, a former pupil of Habergham High School in Burnley, had become hooked on GBL in 2009 before it was made illegal by the Government. The drug - a component of some paint strippers, nail varnish removers and superglue solvents - gives users a feeling of euphoria, but can also reduce their inhibitions.

Over a four year period, Tyhurst was taken to hospital nearly 1,000 times - and was close to death on 15 occasions. She only stopped taking the drug after doctors warned her that, if she didn't, she was likely to die.

Burnley Crown Court was told the stabbing occurred during a violent fracas with Anthony Hurst after she showed up to at his house drunk and armed with a kitchen knife stashed in her coat. She shouted at Hurst: 'you'd better open the f..king door now' and when he did so, she burst in with two accomplices and began to attack and punch him.

As Mr Hurst was pinned down Tyhurst stabbed him three times before his flat screen TV, laptop, mobile phone and wallet were stolen.

Mr Brian McKenna prosecuting said: 'Mr Hurst received several blows to the head, neck and back and felt a couple of puncture wounds on his back. He realised a knife was being used on him. He says he was terrified and so scared. He was then dragged up the stairs and pushed onto a settee where he was choked with an arm placed around his neck.

'He was terrified and began to lose consciousness and couldn't breathe. He honestly thought that he might be killed.'

Tyhurst said she had borrowed a a friends's kitchen knife because she wanted to scare the complainant not stab him. She told officers, 'I jabbed him..' and said that she prodded him three times with the knife - twice in the back and one time in the chest.

She had convictions going back to 2000 when a juvenile for common assault in June 2007 as well as theft, breach of court orders, and common assault and battery in May 2011.

GBL - or gamma butyrolactone - is a component of some paint strippers, nail varnish removers and superglue solvents.

It gives users a feeling of euphoria, but can also reduce their inhibitions and produce a sense of drowsiness.

Once in the body, it turns into notorious drug GHB - known as 'liquid Ecstasy' - banned in 2003 because it was being used as a date rape drug.

The former 'legal high' was made illegal by the Government in December 2009.

Overdoses are common, with as little as one teaspoon enough to put the user in a coma. 

Deaths that have been linked with GBL include that of Lynette Nock, 28, died in 2012 after taking the drug. She was at a memorial party for her friend Carl Fearon, who had died after taking the drug the day before.  

In mitigation defence counsel Mr William Staunton said: 'It's clear she has gone there with the intent to frighten the victim. She didn't gain from the theft of the items, she accepted that at one stage she unplugged the television.

'She is a lady who bears the scars, she was the subjected of prolonged and brutal violence.

'She has gone from one addiction to another, GBL -obtained from squeezing fluid from nail varnish. She is also the victim of violence.

'She would not wish violence on her worst enemy.

She has a puncture wound to her head where her former partner struck her with a screwdriver. She has lost teeth.

'She lived effectively as a rag doll at the hands of a man.

'Custody has caused her to reflect and reflect on her destructive ways. Her determination to be drug free I submit is impressive.'

Tyhurst was also sentenced to a supervision requirement of 18 months and a 12 month drug rehabilitation programme. Because of her addiction, Tyhurst's life expectancy had been reduced by at least ten years - and she admitted she looked far older than other women in their twenties. 

She said her liver was currently operating at a level of just 11 per cent - meaning she will need a transplant in the future.

After the case she said: 'I am trying to get my life back on track and I haven't been on that stuff for a year. I wish I didn't get into trouble, I'm embarrassed for myself. I see my daughter all the time time, she doesn't know about this.'

An accomplice Shaun Andrews, 28, of Burnley, admitted burglary and was jailed for six years at an earlier hearing.
