It’s been a busy fortnight for this Arizona sheriff and Mitt Romney aide, who has come out as gay, denied threatening to deport his ex-lover to Mexico and promised to continue his bid for Congress.

Now Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, 43, is fighting allegations he dated a 17-year-old male student while he was head of the now-closed DeSisto School in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, a decade ago.

The boarding school used controversial discipline methods such as ‘sheeting’, which forced students to remove their clothes and wear only a sheet, according to former students and state records.

Battle: Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, 43, is fighting allegations that he dated a 17-year-old male student

Sheriff Babeu was headmaster from 1999
to 2001 at a time when the school for troubled teenagers was probed by 
state childcare officials for repeated abuse allegations, reported ABC 
affiliate KNXV.

Former student Holli Nielsen said the 
school was ‘cult-like’ and she had to spend her 16th birthday wearing 
nothing but a sheet. State documents also alleged students ‘strip 
searched’ each other.

They also ‘routinely took group 
showers’ leading to sexual abuse, the documents said. Students said 
being ‘cornered’, where they had to sit and face the wall for hours, was
the worst punishment.

The state probe forced the school to 
be shut down three years after Sheriff Babeu left. His sister claimed to KNXV she remembered a student living with him, whom he described as his
‘boyfriend’.

Serious accusations: Babeu, pictured with Senator 
John McCain in 2010, admitted that he was gay this month

Although eight former students claim 
Sheriff Babeu had a relationship with the student, both men deny any 
inappropriate or sexual bond at the school. But the student said they 
remained friends.

At 17 the boy was within the state 
legal age of consent. A spokesman for Sheriff Babeu said he was never 
targeted by any probe or lawsuit and was known for restoring the 
school’s financial stability.

‘Sheriff Babeu never had a sexual 
relationship with a student,’ he told the Los Angeles Times. ‘A student 
has never lived with Sheriff Babeu.’ The sheriff was not involved in discipline issues, he said.

The claims come after the notoriously 
anti-immigration aide to Republican presidential candidate Mr Romney 
left the campaign after he was accused of threatening to deport his 
ex-gay lover to Mexico.

The man, only identified as ‘Jose,’ 
claimed Sheriff Babeu threatened him with deportation if he ever 
disclosed their three-year relationship, reported the Phoenix New Times.
Sheriff Babeu denied this.

He said all the accusations in the 
alternative weekly newspaper were ‘absolutely false, except to the 
issues that refer to me as being gay’ and arose to mar his chances of 
running for congress.

Sheriff Babeu, who served as the 
co-chair of Mr Romney’s campaign in Arizona, is seeking the GOP 
nomination for Arizona’s rural western fourth congressional seat.

The sheriff denied claims he tried to 
threaten the man with deportation if their past relationship was made 
public. Jose’s allegations were first published on Friday in the New 
Times.

'Undeterred': Babeu, who left his volunteer position in Romney's campaign, will continue to run for congress

An attorney for Jose didn't 
immediately return messages from MailOnline earlier this month over this. She told the New 
Times that Jose felt he was ‘being intimidated, and he was in fear for 
his life’.

While the sheriff will not halt his 
congressional campaign, he is no longer a volunteer with Mr Romney’s 
campaign. ‘We support the decision,’ a spokesman for Mr Romney told CNN.

Sheriff Babeu is facing the claim filed 
by Jose that a man famous for border protection and deportation of 
illegal immigrants himself had a relationship with an illegal immigrant.

But he said he has never defined 
himself based on his ethnicity or sexual orientation, and he would 
continue to focus on unemployment and the federal deficit in his 
campaign.
