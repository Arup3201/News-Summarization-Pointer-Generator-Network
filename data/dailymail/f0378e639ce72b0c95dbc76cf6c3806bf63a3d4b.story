A man in California has proposed to his girlfriend with the help of a drone.

Kevin Dilliard, 27, took Courtney Weigand, 25, to Sunset Cliffs in San Diego on Friday afternoon because he said he wanted to show her his drone in action.

Standing on the cliffs at about 3:30 p.m. he handed his now-fianceé first-person view goggles to see what his GoPro camera - attached to a quadcopter drone - was filming some 150 feet above the beach.

When Courtney put on the goggles, the drone was hovering over boyfriend Kevin's proposal which he had written in the sand. It read: 'Court will you marry me?'

When Courtney took off the goggles Kevin – her boyfriend of seven years - had dropped to one knee and was holding an engagement ring. 

Courtney said yes and a relieved Kevin says the elaborate proposal was well worth the two weeks he spent organizing it, reports FOX5.
