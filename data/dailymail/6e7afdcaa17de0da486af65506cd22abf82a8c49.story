A woman who shot her lover over his mediocre performance in bed was released from jail on bond last week, pending an appeal of her four year prison sentence.

Sadie Bell, 58, a woman from Southfield, Michigan, was convicted in April of shooting her partner Edward Lee, 60, in the stomach with a Smith & Wesson semi-automatic handgun. She was convicted of assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder, plus a felony firearms charge.

Bell told police that she was angry at Lee for failing to produce enough ejaculate after coitus, leading her to believe that he was sleeping with another woman.

The catch, according to authorities, is that Bell and Lee had themselves been carrying on a 15-year affair. Lee was married to another woman.

According to the police, the July 28, 2013 incident unfolded when the two had sex, then argued and began to shove each other. Bell then went into the bathroom, came out with the handgun and shot him.

'She stated that she knew he was having an affair because he wasn’t producing enough ejaculate,' Chief Assistant Prosecutor Paul Walton told CBS Detroit. 'She also said to the police some very graphic things about how she expected him to perform, she was a cheap date, she liked sex, she expected him to be able to do what he’s promised; and she said, in essence, to quote her, she was pissed off, so she shot him.'

Lee survived being shot, but spent five weeks in the hospital recovering. He underwent major surgeries to repair damage to his liver, pancreas, colon and kidney.

This was not the first time Bell was arrested for violence against a lover.

In 1991, she was arrested for allegedly shooting another man, her husband. She was not convicted of any crime in this instance, and her husband refused to testify against her. The same man also refused to testify in the more recent case.

Prosecutors said that they did not expect Bell's request for bond to be granted by the court, especially for $10,000. 

'You have a woman who has shown she has a habit of acting out in a 
violent manner,' Walton told the Oakland Press. 'She’s a danger to the public and she should 
be held accountable for her actions.'

According to court documents, Bell's counsel believes that her case will be overturned, due an alleged violation of Bell’s right to effective assistance of counsel related to her decision not to testify on her behalf during the trial.

The charges she was convicted of carried a sentence of up to 10 years.
