As she lay drenched in blood and 
dying on the sidewalk after being stabbed 32 times by her boyfriend, 
little did she know it was to be the beginning of her fairytale.

Melissa Dohme, from Clearwater, Florida, was just 20-years-old when Robert Lee Burton Jr slashed her hands, arms, face and head outside her home, the attack only stopped by a passing couple.

Clearwater firefighter-paramedic 
Cameron Hill, 38, responded to the 911 call, which he said was the 
goriest of his 17-year career.

Love: Melissa Dohme was saved by Cameron Hill, second left, who said he instantly connected with her, even though he couldn't see her face, couldn't tell if she was blond because of the blood and didn't know her name

Though he couldn't see her face, 
couldn't tell if she was blond because of the blood and didn't know her 
name, a strange feeling came over him and he said he knew in his heart 
he was going to see her again.

Melissa ended up being in the hospital for three weeks. She flat lined four times, received 12 units of blood and suffered a stroke that affected her balance, according to The Tampa Bay Times.

A severed nerve partly paralyzed the left side of her face.

Guilty plea: Robert Burton was in court on Tuesday

Though doctors did not know if she 
would speak smile or walk again, she made a remarkable recovery and left
 rehab without a cane.

She became determined to reach out to all those who helped save her and to tell her story to others.

After a trip to Europe with her girlfriends, she returned determined to become a nurse.

For a time, she spoke to everyone - except the firefighter-paramedics from Clearwater Station 47.

In October last year when Melissa was speaking at a Clearwater church, two of her first responders surprised her - one of whom was Cameron.

After hugging and crying and exchanging numbers, Melissa said: 'I was weirdly giddy. I had this feeling about him.'

When they met up again, she said she 
felt she was in the grasp of a full-blown crush, according to Tampa Bay 
Times as they talked easily and naturally.

Cameron did not know what to do but 
could not get the young woman he rescued out of his head. But he 
eventually asked her out and ever since their first date the pair have 
been inseparable.

Last week, the couple attended the pretrial hearing in the first-degree attempted murder case against her ex-boyfriend Robert Burton.

She testified that he would hit and shove her before allegedly stabbing her in January last year. Though she almost lost her life and it was a traumatic and life-changing experience, Melissa would not change it.

'When
 I look back on that night, I can't think of it as all bad anymore 
because I met Cameron,' she said. 'He's the one I've been waiting for. 
My fairy tale.' 

On the night of the attack, Burton 
had been calling and texting Melissa requesting a hug - however, when 
she met him to talk, she said she heard a click, and then sharp pain in 
her neck, where he allegedly embedded his knife.

Ms Dohme met Burton at Clearwater High School, and the couple dated for nearly two years.

However, things took a violent turn when Burton allegedly attacked her outside Ms Dohme’s house last October. Court documents allege that he pulled her hair and punched her repeatedly.

The couple broke up soon after. But Burton called and texted the petite blonde over and over on January 24, saying he needed to see her, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

Ms Dohme told the Times that she initially ignored him and told Burton that she had class early the next day – it was, after all, around 2:30am.

She agreed to see him when he said he was near her house, around 3am.

He said he only needed a hug. Even so, Ms Dohme took pepper spray with her.

According to court documents, Burton asked for a hug, and then began stabbing her in the face and neck.

During the attack, she was screaming as loud as she could, hoping someone would hear.

A young couple who did not want to be publicly identified happened to be in Crest Lake Park.

Recovery: She suffered a slash to the right side 
of her face that severed a nerve. The knife also grazed her carotid 
artery, which meant she was in serious danger of bleeding out

Roving: Ms Dohme, pictured before the attack, still has a long road ahead of her

Law and order: Ms Dohme wrote: 'Ran into these two great men tonight, detectives Ruhlin and Sena! These are the ones working on my case and were able to get the jerk (putting it nicely) to confess his guilt'

According to a police report, the couple – who are both in their late teens – yelled at Burton to stop and said he was going to kill her.

The man attempted to push the 245-pound Burton off of Ms Dohme, but was unable to. Meanwhile, the young woman tried to help Ms Dohme escape to safety and called 911.

Ms Dohme told the Tampa Bay Times that the couple’s intervention likely saved her live. '(Burton) would have stabbed me 'til I was dead', she told the Times.

'I know it's a miracle that I am still here. Even the trauma doctor in his notes wrote, nothing short of miraculous.'

The couple left, and Burton had allegedly gone back to his truck to retrieve a bigger knife. Ms Dohme had lost pints of blood already, and was fading.

Burton was later found after he crashed his car some distance away. He was believed to have overdosed on sleeping pills.

Doctors rushed her to Bayfront, where she underwent several surgeries, and was given 12 units of blood.

She suffered a slash to the right side of her face that severed a nerve. The knife also grazed her carotid artery, which meant she was in serious danger of bleeding out.

Ms Dohme later counted 32 stab wounds, 18 of which were deep.

‘I know it’s a miracle that I am still here,’ she told Bay News 9 in an interview earlier this month. ‘Even the trauma doctor in his notes wrote, nothing short of miraculous.’

But her fighting spirit, as well as her faith helped her persevere. ‘He didn’t win and I won,’ she told the Times.

Within days of the near-lethal attack, 
Ms Dohme was able to breathe on her own, could grasp a pencil, and could
 walk down the hallways of the ICU

She had to regularly attend speech therapy and get check-ups with other specialists.

Remarkably, she went home three weeks later, and finished out her classes at St Petersburg College, earning A’s in her Humanities and Sociology classes.

Burton faces assault charges in addition to first-degree attempted murder charges.

Ms Dohme hasn’t let the injury slow her down. Though she completes seven hours of rehab weekly, she continues to be the bright, smiling young woman she was before the attack.

She is currently backpacking through Europe with a few girlfriends, and has received an outpouring of support from friends and family.

Her brush with death hasn’t stopped her from pursuing her dream – becoming a neo-natal nurse. And more than anything, nearly losing everything has shown her a new appreciation for the small tings.

‘I’ve never loved life so much, I’ve never been so appreciative, I really appreciate every day,’ she told Bay News 9.
