Cardiff City are poised to finally confirm ex-Leyton Orient boss Russell Slade as their new manager.

Slade, 53, has had to act as a consultant for the Championship club since leaving Orient as the clubs ironed out th legalities and finer deatails of what compensation was owed.

Cardiff have been without a manager since ex-Manchester United striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer stepped down on September 18.

Scott Young and Danny Gabbidon have been in caretaker charge since Solskjaer’s departure and were in charge for Friday’s 1-0 defeat at Blackpool although Slade travelled with the squad and was in the stands.

The former Notts County and Yeovil manager Slade had previously watched Cardiff’s 2-1 win over Sheffield Wednesday last Saturday and was at the 1-1 draw at Brighton.

Slade tendered his resignation as manager of League One side Orient on September 24. His job had been under threat after a slump in form, however, that did not deter Cardiff who had also approached Dundee boss Paul Hartley.

Club owner Vincent Tan has said he hopes Slade can beat Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger’s 18-year long-service record.

Slade started his managerial career at Notts County in 1994 and has also managed Scarborough, Grimsby Town, Yeovil Town and Brighton.
