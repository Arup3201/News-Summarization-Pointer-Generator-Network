There's no escaping the Instagram selfie trend, so isn't it about time you perfected your photo face?

Since model Tyra Banks first coined the term 'smizing' a bevvy of popular poses have been infiltrating our social networking sites, including 'pruning', 'teeging' and most recently the 'squinch' by photographer Peter Hurley.

But how do you decide which one to choose? Fear not, one intrepid beauty writer is here to help.

Angelica Hermon from style site neverunderdressed.com has road-tested the (supposedly) most flattering poses to see which ones really work....

What's involved? Lifting and tightening the lower eyelid and only allowing the top eyelid to come down slightly.

Verdict? 'Perhaps I didn’t get it quite right because I think I look like 
I’ve had seven and a half Aperol Spritzs too many.

'I
 teamed it with a grin here, which probably doesn’t help the drunken 
look, but without a smile it would no doubt look more serious and 
therefore more cool. I need to practice.'

Beauty journalist Angelica Hermon of NeverUnderdressed.com has tested out the most popular picture poses including squinching (l) and smizing (r)

What's involved? Smiling with your eyes in the style of Tyra Banks on America's Next Top Model.

Verdict? 'It’s actually pretty hard to smile with your eyes. Whilst also trying not to smile with your mouth. I felt like I was trying to freeze myself with a peculiar look on my face as if playing Grandmother’s Footsteps. I’ve realised that Tyra’s heavy layer of smoky eye make-up gets her half way to the smize.'

What's involved? Copying the Olsen sisters to project a sultry almost serious look with your mouth.

Verdict?: 'This felt like the 
most posey of the lot and least like what I’d naturally do with my 
expression if a camera was thrust in my face. To me, it looks like I’ve had a dodgy filler/collagen job done around my mouth. Or have really bad mouth ulcers.

'But
 on those Olsen twins, it looks utterly fabulous. As poses go, it’s far 
better than the 90s pout (see Posh Spice) and thoroughly easy to do on 
demand.'

Angelica attempts to give the Olsens a run for her money with her pruning pose (l) and teegs like Lily Allen (r)

What's involved? Bear your front teeth and press your tongue closely behind them with it slightly on show (this is Lily Allen's favourite pose).

Verdict? 'Though Lily nails this look every time, I don’t think my version looks anywhere near as good. It reminds me of my 3 year old niece who has a distinct lisp and whose tongue seems to permanently hang out of her mouth like a Labrador puppy. I think I’ll leave this one to Lily.'

What's involved? Let loose, giggle, chuckle, ROFL and then freeze.

Verdict: 'This felt natural and easy and although it was completely phoney, I think I fooled the camera well. It
 felt the most normal of them all. I thought back to Saturday night when
 my best friend slipped across the dance floor (ending up in a 
near-splits stance), let out a loud belly laugh and hey presto, there it
 is.'

LOLing: This pose involves laughing out loud and freezing before the flash goes off

Portraitist Peter Hurley claims the squinch is
the act of squinting your eyes in such a way as to ooze confidence
 and self-assuredness.

He believes that this will make you look
 far more attractive than staring wide-eyed into the camera, which 
portrays fear and uncertainty.

Firstly, Hurley emphasises that squinching isn’t the same as squinting and while the difference may be minor, it is vital.

When you squint, your top and bottom eyelids close, which, Hurley believes makes you look far from confident.

Does it really work? Portraitist Peter Hurley thinks that 'squinching' (R) makes you look more photogenic

When you ‘squinch,’ however, you’re 
lifting and tightening the lower eyelid and only allowing the top eyelid
 to come down slightly.

He says: 'If you're a photographer out there, make your 
people squinch. And if you're a human being who just wants to look hot, 
this is going to do it for you.

'Want to know why? Because confidence comes from the eyes.'
