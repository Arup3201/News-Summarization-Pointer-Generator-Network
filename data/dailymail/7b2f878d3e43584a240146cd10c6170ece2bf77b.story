Botanists have attempted to cross-pollinate two giant plant species, in a bid to create the largest lily pad in the world.

Trainee botanist Hannah Rogers, 17, worked with experts at Ventnor Botanical Gardens on the Isle of Wight to delicately hand-pollinate an enormous Amazonian water lily that only blooms for two nights a year.

The process mimics that performed in the
wild by nocturnal scarab beetles attracted to the plant's pungent 
pineapple-like scent over its two nights of flowering.

A botanical marvel bloomed at the Ventnor Botanical Garden on the Isle of Wight this weekend and 17-year-old trainee botanist Hannah Rogers (pictured) 17, had to bravely don her swimsuit to hand-pollenate lilies

The giant Amazonian lily flowers for just two nights a year and Ms Rogers had to plunge into the pool to remove pollen from Victoria cruziana on its first flowering to replicate the process performed by a nocturnal scarab beetle attracted to its heavy pineapple like scent in the wild

The unusual plant blooms in white on the first night, then changes sex and flowers the following night a deep red before sinking back under the water.

The botanists are attempting to create a hybrid of water lily species Victoria Cruziana and Victoria Amazonica and it is hoped the resulting plant will be the largest lily in the world.

The massive plants, as wide as 6ft, grow at an extraordinary speed, transforming from a seed the size of a pea in just three months.

Their tiny seeds are placed in huge 8ft square pots holding two tonnes of manure, which are then submerged in 22,000 gallons of water.

The massive plants grow at an extraordinary speed and were a pea-sized seed just three months ago. The flowers must be hand-pollinated by botanists such as Ms Rogers (pictured) using a paintbrush while they bloom for just two nights of the year

But their lives are short - by October they will be dead.They are grown at the gardens in a specially designed hot house powered by solar panels which recreates their natural growing conditions - the only place in the world to do so.

Inside the house the specially filtered water is kept at 26 degrees Celsius, while the air temperature stays at a balmy 45C and 90 per cent humidity.

Chris Kidd, curator of Ventnor Botanical Gardens, said: 'The reproduction cycle of the giant water lily is a facinating thing.

'The first night's flower is bright white and very highly scented like pineapple to attract a pollinator, in this instance a scarab beetle.

'When the scarab beetle enters the flower it is inclined to stay inside it because it feeds on the flower's nectar-sweet glands plus it is about five degrees warmer inside the flower.

'The flower then closes its petals, trapping the beetle inside. The following night, the flower opens again but this time it's red and it has changed sex to male.

'By this point the scarab beetle has eaten all the plant's food so it goes off in search of a white flower, and pollination takes place.'

Mr Kidd pointed out that as scarab beetles do not like in the UK, botanists have to do the job for them.

Ms Rogers does the job that a scarab beetle would do in the wild. The pineapple-scented flower attracts the beetle, and then traps it inside where it feeds on sweet nectar. When it re-opens it has changed colour and sex. The beetle moves on in search of another tasty white flower, and pollination takes place

'It means stripping off in the middle of the night and getting in the pool with the lilies.

'We open up the flowers and transfer the pollen between plants using a paint brush.'

The giant water lilies were named in honour of Queen Victoria after their discovery by British botanists in the mid 19th century.

The team at Ventnor Botanical Gardens are hoping their new species could smash the current world record for the largest water lily ever grown.

The massive plants, as wide as 6ft, grow at an extraordinary speed, transforming from a seed the size of a pea in just three months. The tiny seeds (pictured) are placed in huge 8ft square pots holding two tonnes of manure, which are then submerged in 22,000 gallons of water

Mr Kidd set the record of eight foot and nine inches in 1996 while working at Kew Gardens.

'By crossing the two species we will be able to grow a lily that is much bigger,' he said.

'It will have a very wide leaf but also a high ridge to its edge.'

'Instead of leaves of about 6ft across, we are hoping it will have leaves of 9ft.'

Mr Kidd said that this time next year, the botanists should know if they will be in the Guinness Book of World Records or not.
