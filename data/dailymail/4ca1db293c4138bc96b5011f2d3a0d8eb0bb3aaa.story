The Scout5000 - effectively a smartphone for dogs - can monitor a dog's health, track their location and even allows owners to speak to their pets remotely

Doting pet owners will soon be able to get a dog's eye view of the world following the launch of a new 'smart collar' for animals.

The Scout5000 - effectively a smartphone for dogs - can monitor a dog's health, track their location and even allows owners to speak to their dogs remotely.

The device can also stream videos showing what the dogs are up to, using a state-of-the-art built-in camera.  

The new gadget, created by Motorola and video streaming developer Hubble, uses 3G to send alerts to the owner's smartphone, while they are away from their pets. 

The downside is that the dog will need a data package for the collar to work, although it does come with ones year's 3G service as part of the £131 ($199) price tag.

The collar - which the creators say is splash, chew and paw-proof - can also connect to wi-fi and Bluetooth. 

The company unveiled the device this week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

The camera built into the collar shoots in 720p HD, while there is also a loudspeaker and microphone installation to ensure the dogs can hear their owners' instructions.

The device also includes GPS, meaning the canines can be tracked should they ever decide to embark on a Homeward Bound-style adventure.  

The firm is not new to the pet arena, with a motion sensitive webcam that enables owners to set up and remotely control the camera and track their pets when away from home. 

It works by recording when it senses motion, meaning owners never miss any activity while they are at work or away.

Action camera firm GoPro also make a dog harness to which you can attach their HD video cameras.  

Motorola says tech-savvy pet owners will be able to get their hands on the Scout5000 from June, when it goes on sale in the US..

A scaled-down model, the Scout 2500, which is suitable for smaller pets and does not include a camera, will be introduced at the same time for £65 ($91).
