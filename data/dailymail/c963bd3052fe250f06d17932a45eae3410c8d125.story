Suspect: Manchester Mayor Ronald Drake revealed this afternoon that the suspected gunman was his nephew, 43-year-old Rick Smith, pictured. He was later killed in a shootout with police

Police are trying to piece together why an Illinois man who shot dead a family of five yesterday morning scooped up a six-year-old girl who survived the spray of gunshots and demanded a neighbor take her to hospital.

Rick Odell Smith, 43, broke into the home in the small town of Manchester, where his uncle is mayor, and gunned down a great-grandmother, a young couple and three young children, authorities said.

But when the suspect noticed the young girl was still alive despite serious gunshot wounds, he scooped her up and carried her to a neighbor's home, risking precious getaway time.

The child, Kassidy Ralston, was rushed to Springfield hospital where she remained in critical condition with facial injuries, according to Q13Fox.com.

Smith then jumped into his white Chevy Lumina and sped off. But officers caught up with him hours later and he ultimately died in a shootout with police.

State Police Lt. Col. Todd Kilby couldn't explain Smith's apparent concern for the young victim.

'All I have is that it was a neighbor' who took her in, he told reporters at a press conference. A source told the TV station that Smith asked the neighbor to take the girl to hospital. The neighbor called police.

State police would not comment on a possible motive.

But a neighbor told Q13Fox.com that Smith had been going through a messy custody battle with the great-grandmother Joanne Sinclair's daughter over their four-year-old child.

Shocking: Brittney Luark, 22, with sons Brantley and Nolan, was shot in Manchestor, Ill. home with her family

Tragic: One-year-old Brantley Ralston was shot dead on Wednesday. His parents, 5-year-old brother and great-grandmother were also killed

Neither she nor his daughter were in the home at the time of the shooting, authorities and the family told the station.

'He
 was under a lot of stress. ...There was a lot of problems with custody 
with the daughter,' said a neighbor of Smith's near his home in 
Roodhouse.

The neighbor 
said Smith and Sinclair's daughter were together for about five years 
and had lived with one another at the Roodhouse property until recently.

The neighbor described Smith as a hardworking handyman.

'He did odd jobs for people, he could fix anything. He was a really hard worker,' the neighbor told Q13Fox.com.

According to the neighbor, Smith had custody of his daughter fairly often but there was 'a lot of friction with (her) family.'

Manchester
 Mayor Ronald Drake revealed this afternoon that the suspected gunman in
 the horrific slaying was his nephew, Rick Smith.

The
 dead were identified by family as Joanne Sinclair, 65, her 
granddaughter Brittney Luark, 22, the girl's boyfriend James Roy 
Ralston, and the couple's sons Nolan Ralston, 5, and Brantley Ralston, 
1.

Kassidy Ralston suffered gunshot wounds and remains in
critical condition, Sinclair's son-in-law Brad Teeter told the Chicago 
Tribune.

Senseless: Five-year-old Nolan Ralston was also killed in the tragedy

Lt. Col. Kilby said Smith entered the home 
through a back door. They say two victims were found in one bedroom, two
 in another bedroom and an adult male in a hallway.

Police believe Smith and the victims were acquainted but have not provided details.

The small village of Manchester, that has a 
population of just 350, is in shock over the senseless tragedy.

A neighbor called police and told them that Smith fled the home in the white sedan. A car chase ensued, leading authorities to the nearby town of Winchester. The
 suspect was ultimately captured after a dramatic shootout with the 
police. He later died at a hospital.

Police said they found a rifle, shotgun and large hunting knife in Smith's car.

Mayor Drake identified the gunman as his nephew on Wednesday afternoon. He said he hadn't spoken to Smith in two years, but he believed his nephew was unemployed. Drake said the last time Smith contacted him was to borrow tools.

Tragic: A tragedy unfolded in the tiny Illinois town on Manchester, when five people were found shot dead early on Wednesday

Deadly: Police officials investigate the scene at a house in Manchester, Ill., where the five victims were found dead

Scott County State's Attorney Michael
 Hill said Smith, of rural Morgan County, had previous convictions for 
reckless homicide, drugs and bad checks.

The family lived in a first-floor apartment of a housing development, according to state police spokeswoman Monique Bond. 

'The guy broke into the house,' Mr Teeter told the local paper.

'I
 couldn't tell you about the guy, never met him, never seen him, never 
talked to him. Apparently broke into the home of my wife's mother and 
shot everybody inside.'

'I'm at a loss right now,' he said.

Schools in
 Manchester, which is located 50 miles west from Springfield, Ill. and 
about 90 miles north of St. Louis, Mo., were closed after officials from
 the local sheriff warned school administrators that the suspect was 
still on the loose early Wednesday morning.

Innocence: Relatives are in shock over the tragic shooting that left little Brantley Ralston, 1, dead. Four of his relatives were also killed

Les Stevens of the North Greene 
School District says he was told that the victims had been shot to 
death. The district was later informed that Smith had been captured. 

The village has a total area of 1.06 square miles.

'It's a tragedy,' Mayor Drake said earlier to the Tribune.

'I've lived here for 43 years and my wife's lived her for all of her life and there's never been a homicide.'

Manchester
 resident Julie Hardwick, 48, said she lives in the same county housing 
authority complex as the victims.

'The kids were really nice,' Hardwick said of the family. 'You couldn't ask for better kids.'

The Rev. Robin Lyons of Manchester United Methodist Church, one of two churches in the community said, 'this shows tragedy can happen anywhere.'

Two area school superintendents said they received calls from county sheriffs before 6 a.m. informing them that five people had been shot to death at a house in Manchester and that a suspect was at large.

Superintendent David Roberts of the Winchester School District and Les Stevens of the North Greene Unit District No. 3 both said they immediately canceled classes when they were told of the shootings and that other school districts did the same.

Roberts said the wounded girl is a student at Winchester Grade School and her teacher was with her at the Springfield hospital.
