A widow has made one of the biggest donations to the Conservative Party in its history - while leaving nothing for her family.

Violet Baker, who died aged 85 last year, bequeathed a staggering £769,000 to the party in her will.

But she gave nothing to her relatives - and just £2,000 to the man who cared for her during her final years of life.

Ms Baker, who lived in a modest semi-detached house in Birmingham, specified in her will that she wished to leave her 'entire estate' aside from the £2,000 to the Conservative Party, her solicitor, Michael Wooldridge, told The Telegraph.

He added that the widow had been 'fully compos mentis' when bequeathing the sum, which is one of the largest donations the Tory party has ever received.

During her final three years of her life, Ms Baker was cared for by her neighbour, Malcolm Baker, who visited her three times a day. 

Today, Mr
 Baker said he was 'shocked' by the size of Ms Baker's bequest - 
claiming the widow had lived by the motto 'buy the cheapest' and had let her
 house fall into disrepair.

'You’ve
 shocked me, telling me she left more than £750,000,' he said. 'She would
 go mad if the shopping was more than a tenner.'

He added that Ms Baker had never shown any political inclination - while her late husband, Raymond, was described by relatives as 'more socialist than Conservative'.

Ms Baker, who had no children, received more than £500,000 worth of investments in stocks, 
shares and bonds after her husband passed away in 2009.

She is believed to have cut herself
 off from her family - which includes at least three nephews and nieces -
 during the late 1980s.

Tricky situation: Last year, Mr Cameron (left) and Nick Clegg (right) decided to give up a £520,000 bequest from spinster Joan Edwards following claims that she had not wanted the money to go to political parties

Mr Woolridge said he had placed adverts in local papers in a bid to find any of her 'blood relatives', but had had no luck.

Today, Ms Baker's nephew, Peter Winters, described the pensioner's donation as a 'mystery'.

'I would have thought if anyone deserved the 
money, it should have been the chap who looked after her,' he said. 'Even the 
millionaires who give to the Conservative Party don’t give that much in 
one go.'

Last year, David 
Cameron and Nick Clegg decided to give up a £520,000 
bequest from spinster Joan Edwards following claims that she had not wanted the money to go to
 political parties.

The Coalition parties came under fire after it emerged they had carved up the money given to the Government to spend ‘as they may think fit’.

Instead of using the money on the Health Service, schools or to ease the national debt, the parties had shared it between them as a donation.

However, after a furious backlash, including mounting criticism from their own MPs, Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg ordered their parties to return the money to the Treasury.

A
 Conservative party spokesman told the newspaper: 'All donations accepted by the 
Conservative Party are fully permissible and declared to the Electoral 
Commission.'
