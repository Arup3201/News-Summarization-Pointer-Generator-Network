Ethic minority voters are abandoning Labour according to a poll which shows the number of Indian, African and Caribbeans who support the party has fallen since 2010.

The party has traditionally benefited from the ethnic minority vote, especially with people of Afro-Caribbean descent.

However, figures from the British Election Study reportedly show that the number of African voters who say they identify with Ed Miliband's party has slipped from 79 to 63 per cent since 1997, while Caribbean support has fallen from 78 to 67 per cent.

More worrying for Miliband will be Indian support collapsing from 77 per cent to 45 per cent - a fall of more than three-quarters - while support among people of Pakistani origin has fallen from 77 to 57 per cent, according to the figures revealed by theTelegraph.

 'The ethnic minorities are seen to be the core of Labour party vote, they have been for years, for decades but I will make these people here representing Labour a little bit uncomfortable about this assumption that minorities will vote for them as a matter of course,' Dr Maria Sobolewska, an expert from Manchester University and part of the team conducting the Ethnic Minority British Election Study, told a conference this month, according to the newspaper's website.

News that Labour is falling out of favour with ethnic minority voters comes after research released earlier this year predicted that Britain's black and ethnic minority communities could account for almost a third of the population by 2050.

Currently, eight million people, or 14 per cent of the UK population, are from ethnic minorities. But they now account for 80 per cent of population growth, while the white population remains constant.

Experts from  think-tank Policy Exchange predict that as a result, by the middle of the century between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of the population – up to 16million people – will be from a minority community.

In the last election, the Conservatives received 16 per cent of ethnic minority votes, while Labour had 68 per cent, according to the Ethnic Minority British Election Study which was undertaken by researchers from Oxford, Manchester and Essex Universities.

Research by Ipsos Mori showed the Conservative share in 2010 had increased from the 2005 election when the party got just ten per cent of votes cast by ethnic minority voters.

Conservative strategist Lynton Crosby told Conservative MPs they should look to Boris Johnson's  mayoral campaign, which won over large sections of the non-white community

In October, Conservative strategist Lynton Crosby said David Cameron needed to do more to win over voters from minority background.

He told MPs they should look to Boris Johnson’s  mayoral campaign, which won over large sections of the non-white community.

In a meeting at the Tory party conference, Crosby - who ran Johnson's 2012 campaign - said it had seen 'Boris outperform the Conservative party by 40% in the BME [black minority ethnic] communities'. 

But Dr Sobolewska said if voters from minority backgrounds were turning away from Labour, that did not necessarily mean they would give their support to the Conservatives - despite Tory attempts to win departing Labour voters over.

'They [the Conservatives] don't think for the effort they are putting in they are getting enough back - in fact they think what is going to happen to them is this so-called death by demographics that has been advertised as something that is already happening to the republicans in the US,' she said.
