Caught 'em: Reverend Bev Mason, the vicar at Bingley All Saints Parish Church, photographer the parking violation

A vicar who claimed over-zealous traffic wardens were preying on her Sunday congregation was shocked to see the wardens’ van parked on double yellow lines.

Reverend Bev Mason took a picture of  the council van’s parking violation as attendants patrolled outside her church on Sunday, just weeks after they had given her a ticket for the same offence.

The incident has been reported to the council, who have reprimanded the offending wardens, and reiterated to others that they must practise what they preach.

The vicar said: ‘They must be dreadfully embarrassed.

'They were going round giving more of our churchgoers’ tickets at the time. I couldn’t believe my eyes.

'The warden’s van was parked right on the bend, on double yellow lines.

‘I called out to the two men, ‘Is this your van?’ They were mortified.’

Reverend Mason, who has had four parking tickets since starting at All Saints Parish Church in Bingley, West Yorkshire, described the wardens as ‘merciless’ in targeting her congregation.

‘These people are committed members of our community, they’re so kind and live holy lives yet they feel they’re being penalised for it.

‘Every Sunday there’s someone in our church who gets a ticket.’ 

She added: ‘The council have restricted the parking in the marked bays to two hours, meaning people who turn up early and stay behind after to tidy up get fined.

‘They sometimes over-run on the parking by minutes and end up with tickets - which, as good Christians, they always pay.

‘For some people, this is the only time of fellowship and they are being penalised. It’s very unfair.’

Those who stay to help with baptisms after the normal Sunday service are also among those to be slapped with fines.

No parking rule: Bradford Council have now reprimanded the traffic wardens over incident outside All Saints Parish Church, Bingley, West Yorkshire

Adding the restrictions were ‘curtailing the activities of the church’, she said: ‘What my people don’t do is park on double yellows on the bend.’

 All Saints was hosting a light-hearted ‘Holy Hilarity’ service that morning and Rev’d Mason added: ‘People saw the funny side and were rolling around laughing.’

Shipley MP Philip Davies said: ‘I was very sorry to learn of the concern that traffic wardens in Bingley are targeting people going to church.

‘If that is the case it would be unacceptable. ‘I will pursue this matter on behalf of the Church with Bradford Council.’

A Bradford Council spokesman said: ‘It is clearly unacceptable for a Council  van to be parked on double yellow lines and all Council Wardens have been instructed they must adhere to parking restrictions at all times.

‘We need to look into this matter to see what has happened on this occasion and consider what action needs to be taken.

‘With regard to the other point raised about extending the limited waiting time in this particular street, it is likely that any changes could raise objections from local residents living there.

‘We will contact the Reverend Mason directly to discuss both matters in more detail.’
