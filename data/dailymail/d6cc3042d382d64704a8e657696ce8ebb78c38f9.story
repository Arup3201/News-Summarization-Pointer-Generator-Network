There is one vote of immense significance going on in Scotland on Thursday where nearly all of us can surely agree it would be best to hear a ‘yes’ verdict. Here’s one area where Alex Salmond and the politicians based in London are in total agreement.

The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews has been holding its autumn meeting on September 18 since 1783 but there might never have been a gathering as momentous as this.

At this meeting, the result of the ballot on whether to allow women members will be declared.

Since the alternative is worldwide ridicule — and the 2,400 men who make up the R&A membership are hardly fools — it is expected they will vote in large numbers for women to be allowed to join the club.

Thereafter, expect 15 or so women holding prominent positions within the golfing community to be sounded out and fast-tracked. In addition to high-ranking officials, let us hope the list includes popular ex-players such as former world No 1 Annika Sorenstam.

Peter Dawson, chief executive of the R&A, has spoken about a ‘direction of travel’ on this subject and it finally looks like the organisation has swapped a glacier as the preferred mode of transport for a speedboat.

If the vote goes as expected, the next thing will be for other courses on The Open rota with men-only membership to note that times have changed and act accordingly.

For the R&A, the manner in which The Open at men-only Muirfield last year was overshadowed by the issue and the uneasiness felt all week by influential sponsors such as HSBC appears to have been the tipping point. There is only one more Open scheduled for a men-only club — Royal Troon in 2016 — and it is hard to envisage the privilege being granted again unless the clubs in question change.

Royal St George’s is the other men-only club on the rota and the noises emanating from all three over the past six months indicate they are ready to follow the lead of the governing body.

It took long enough, it’s true, but thankfully it truly looks as if this great stain that has blighted the game for so long is about to be finally washed away.

The FedEx Cup play-offs are horribly contrived and dreadfully unfair on the men who play well all season long. But, like the Championship play-off game in football that decides the final promotion spot to the Premier League, there is no denying the format ensures an exciting end to the PGA Tour season.

The outcome was in doubt almost to the end at East Lake on Sunday before Billy Horschel got to the 16th and closed out the Tour Championship with the greatest putt for par he will ever hole to deny the likes of Rory McIlroy and Jim Furyk and claim his $11.44million payday. The $10m FedEx bonus he received, in addition to the $1.44m first prize for the Tour Championship, is the headline figure but the rest didn’t exactly go home empty-handed. McIlroy pocketed $2m for finishing third in the FedEx standings. Justin Rose earned $300,000 for being placed 11th. And on it went. Paul Casey was busy winning the KLM Open in Holland on Sunday, but was still shipped another $75,000 by the sponsor for finishing 95th, after his participation in the first two play-off events. A wonderful life when you get to that level in golf, isn’t it?

QUOTE OF THE WEEK

‘I’m about ready to cry right now because, honestly, Jack Nicklaus is a hero. I can’t really explain how good it feels to beat his record.’

Will Jon Rahm prove to be the next great Spanish golfer? The 19-year-old has been making a name for himself in the American college scene and, at the World Amateur Team Championship in Japan last week, broke a 72-hole individual scoring record set by the Golden Bear that had stood for 54 years. No wonder he was so emotional. The event itself was won by the United States.

New parent Graeme McDowell and enigmatic Frenchman Victor Dubuisson might have had a late change of heart but the ISPS Handa Wales Open this week will still boast its strongest line-up since Celtic Manor hosted the Ryder Cup in 2010.

True, there will be no one remotely as famous and powerful as the avid golfing leftie who showed up at Celtic Manor earlier this month.

But, while United States President Barack Obama has moved on, Lee Westwood, Jamie Donaldson, Stephen Gallacher and Thomas Bjorn, plus Europe captain Paul McGinley, have all decided the best way of tuning up for the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles is by revisiting the scene of the last home triumph.

It’s a welcome change of fortune for an event that has been neglected for too long by too many.
