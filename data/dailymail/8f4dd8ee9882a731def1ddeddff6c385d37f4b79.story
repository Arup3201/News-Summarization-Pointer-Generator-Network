Manchester United continue to persist in their chase of Marquinhos but are fighting a losing battle.

United have hit the phones hard over the last week in a bid to seek an asking price for the Brazilian central defender, but have so far found French champions Paris Saint-Germain stubborn in their resistance.

PSG have made it clear they do not wish to sell the 20-year-old but United feel they are able to push through a deal ahead of the 11pm deadline.

The 20-year-old is wanted by Manchester United this transfer window, but PSG want to keep him

Marquinhos, who can also operate at right back, has had to settle to playing second fiddle to international team-mates David Luiz and Thiago Silva.

United are still keen to strengthen at the back despite encouraging signs of defensive solidity over the last two months.

Marquinhos hasn’t enjoyed a run in Laurent Blanc’s side since the beginning of the season and could be open to a move if he believes opportunities will continue to be limited.

Samed Kilic is attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs keen on bringing him to England

The oil-rich owners of PSG have become frustrated at United’s continued calls over the past week and look set to stand firm in their refusal.

 Meanwhile, Auxerre's Samed Kilic is a target for a host of Premier League clubs.

The 19-year-old midfielder has been watched at various junctures by Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United and Aston Villa.

The Turkish-born French central midfielder was subject of a bid from St. Etienne in the past few days, but it was knocked back by second division Auxerre.
