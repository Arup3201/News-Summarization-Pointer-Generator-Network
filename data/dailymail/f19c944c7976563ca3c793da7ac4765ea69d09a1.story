Two Baylor University students have died and two others were seriously injured after they lost control of their pick-up truck as they drove to a clarinet performance in Louisiana.

Laura Onwudinanti, 21, of Grand Prairie, Texas and John 'Jack' Stewart, a 19-year-old only child from Dallas were killed when the vehicle slammed into a tree on Texas 7 near Marlin on Tuesday morning.

Megan Ritzi, 18, from Fort Worth, suffered a broken pelvis and two broken legs and was rushed to Scott & White Healthcare, where she is critical after having a foot amputated, her father said.

The driver of the vehicle, 21-year-old Jacob Hale from Fort Worth, was also injured and was taken to the hospital, where he is listed in fair condition, the Star Telegram reported.

Loss: Talented musicians Laura Onwudinanti, 21, left, and Jack Stewart, 19, right, were killed when the truck they were traveling in lost control and slammed into a tree in Texas on Tuesday morning

The four gifted musicians were traveling to perform at the 
International Clarinet Association meeting at Louisiana State University
 in Baton Rouge, Baylor University said in a news release.

Their 2003 Dodge was heading eastbound when it drifted off the highway and when Hale tried to correct the vehicle, he lost control and the vehicle flipped on its side and smacked into a tree.

The wreckage was wrapped around a tree when troopers responded to the scene about 9.30am.

DPS reports show alcohol and speed were not factors in the crash and that all four students were wearing seatbelts.

Survivors: Megan Ritzi, 18, survived but needed one of her feet amputated after the crash and remains in critical condition. Jake Hale, 21, right, was driving the vehicle and is now in fair condition

But Onwudinanti, who graduated from Baylor with a degree in music education last year, and Stewart, a junior instrumental studies major, were both pronounced dead at the scene.

Stewart, who had been the principal clarinet player at his high school, previously said in an interview with the Dallas Morning News: 'I will attempt to change the world by changing the lives of everyone around me through my music, my leadership, and my friendship.;

Hale, a senior instrumental major, and
 Ritzi, an incoming freshman, were rushed to the trauma center.

Her father, Bill Ritzi, expressed his shock on Facebook on Tuesday.

'I
 almost lost my baby girl today,' he wrote. 'The team at Baylor Scott & White 
kept Megan's heart going. She is in critical but stable condition and is
 being kept sedated.

Questions: Hale drifted off the highway but when he tried to correct the vehicle, he lost control and hurtled off the road and slammed into a tree. Two students were pronounced dead at the scene

Terrifying: Alcohol and speed were not factors in the crash, and all four were wearing seat belts

'She broke her pelvis, both legs and one foot had to
 be amputated. But my girl is alive!!!'

He added: 'Megan's good friend Jake Hale was
 also fortunate to have survived. My heart aches for the families that 
did loose [sic] their precious children today and I pray that they will some 
how cope with this devastation.

'Please keep Megan in your thoughts and 
prayers. She will have a long recovery and will be challenged physically,
 mentally and emotionally. I love you, my Sacred child.'

Baylor President and Chancellor Ken Starr also shared his sadness in a statement.

'The hearts of the Baylor University family and our School of Music are broken today as we mourn the passing of these remarkably talented students who have been taken too soon from us,' he said.

Shock: Megan's father Bill, pictured toegther left, revealed his daughter has had a foot amputated and has a long struggle ahead of her. Right, Jack is pictured with a friend. He was his parents' only child

Friends: Laura, Jake (center back) and Jack (right) were heading to Louisiana for a concert when tragedy struck

'We pray that God's grace and comfort will surround the families and friends of Jack Stewart and Laura Onwudinanti at this terribly sad hour.'

He added: 'We continue to labor in prayer for Jake Hale and Megan Ritzi, and for their attending physicians, as they are treated for their injuries. We ask the Baylor family to keep all loved ones and friends, and our School of Music faculty, staff and students, in their thoughts and prayers.'

The crash remains under investigation.

'We're still trying to figure it out,' Trooper D.L. Wilson, a Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman told the Dallas Morning News. 'It was a straight roadway, with no curves so it is very unusual.'
