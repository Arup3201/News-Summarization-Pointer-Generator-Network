Steven Gerrard scored on his return to Liverpool's starting line-up, but the Reds captain should have also been awarded a penalty... and Leicester keeper Kasper Schmeichel knows it.

Gerrard reminded those who have questioned his Anfield future with an inspirational performance during Liverpool's 3-1 victory at the King Power Stadium.

The 34-year-old netted his side's second goal, after Adam Lallana had equalised Simon Mignolet's opening gaffe, and looked set to double his tally when he burst into the opposition box during the closing stages after the Foxes were reduced to 10-men.

Gerrard is also able to smile about the incident after confronting the keeper

Schmeichel rushed out and appeared to nudge Gerrard off the ball - leaving the former England midfielder sprawled on the floor and expecting a penalty. But, to Gerrard's absolute astonishment, Lee Mason waved play on and denied him the chance of adding to his 177 goals for the club.

Schmeichel was all smiles when confronted by Gerrard after the incident because he reckons he’s got away with one, which would also have seen the keeper sent off and Leicester seeing out the game with nine-men!

Jordan Henderson secured victory only minutes later after reacting to another Schmeichel mistake.

Meanwhile, Leicester defender Wes Morgan's week went from bad to worse.

The 30-year-old centre back scored an own goal on Saturday as Leicester were beaten 3-2 by fellow strugglers QPR 

And on Tuesday evening, Morgan’s error set up Gerrard for the goal which made it 2-1 and he was then sent off  for pulling back Rickie Lambert.
