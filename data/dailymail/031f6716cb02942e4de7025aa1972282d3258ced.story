Roger Federer was so thrilled with reaching the US Open semi-finals after saving two match points that his voice was quivering with the effects of adrenaline and emotion.

‘It’s just unbelievable,’ he told his courtside interviewer with the enthusiasm of a teenager after delivering another late night classic on Arthur Ashe Stadium that saw him squeeze through against Gael Monfils.

Except Federer, who plays Croatia’s Marin Cilic for a place in the final, is no teenager. He is the 33-year-old father of four children (two sets of twins), but if that has shaved anything from his desire and competitive spirit it is becoming harder than ever to discern.

Victory: Roger Federer beat Gael Monfils 4-6, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 in their US Open quarter-final

It certainly was for the mercurial Monfils, who if he had the same natural appetite for success as the Swiss master would surely have achieved more in a career that has never quite delivered on its early promise.

He has not had a coach for 18 months, swigs Coke during the changeovers and seems to make everything up as he goes along with glorious spontaneity.

The contrast could not be greater to Federer, who at this stage of his life knows he has to plan everything with the precision that his country’s watches are known for — not just his training but his family logistics as well. That is why he will be favoured to reach a second consecutive Grand Slam final of the season, where he would meet either Japan’s Kei Nishikori or still the tournament’s most likely winner, Novak Djokovic. It is also why he has the resolve to hold off the pair of match points which came at 4-5 in the fourth set in the course of a 4-6, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 victory over Monfils.

Impressive: Despite having no coach, and drinking coke during the match, Monfils was impressive 

‘You know, being down match point, it’s just not fun,’ he explained. ‘Because you’re so close to leaving the court with your head hanging down and going to have to do press which is so annoying after you’ve lost.

‘It’s hard to block it out, but you snap back in because you don’t have much time. You’re like “Okay, let me try and hit a good serve. Let’s hope it works”.’

Federer hardly needs the cash or the titles. He has 17 Grand Slams to his name and his nearest pursuer, Rafael Nadal, is currently out with wrist problems. His fortune is estimated to be at least £150million.

Stretch: Federer knows how important preparation is for him now that he is 33

The key to his longevity is the pure and enduring love of the game, the lifestyle, the competition and doubtless the fame.

To help sustain him he has hired his childhood idol Stefan Edberg to work with him, and the coaching situations of all four men’s semi-finalists provide a fascinating sub-plot as the event reaches its climax.

The four coaches — Edberg, Michael Chang (Nishikori), Boris Becker (Djokovic) and Goran Ivanisevic (Cilic) — read like the semi-final line-up for some ATP Tour Masters event from the early nineties. All are former Grand Slam champions, and their appointments followed Andy Murray employing Ivan Lendl.

Champion: Federer has 17 Grand Slams to his name and has earned an estimated £150million 

Tennis players are always trying to find an edge and when they see something working for one of their rivals they tend to follow suit. Who knows, maybe in a few years many of the top names will be coached by women.

In Federer’s case Edberg was hired more as a part-time mentor at first, although it has developed into something resembling full-blown coaching. The Swede used to hate coming to New York as a player, yet he has spent the time here overseeing his charge’s run into the last four.

Becker’s first six months on the job were not considered a success, yet now he is poised to help deliver a second Slam title alongside the Serb.
