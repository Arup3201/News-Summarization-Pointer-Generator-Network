North and South Korean warships have exchanged gunfire after Kim Jong-Un's navy were accused of illegally entering waters belonging to its neighbour.

In the latest sign of rising animosity between the bitter rivals, officials from South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff and Defense Ministry said a North Korean vessel fired two artillery shells at a ship patrolling  the countries' disputed maritime boundary in the Yellow Sea.

The shells apparently missed the South 
Korean ship, which responded to the act by deliberately firing several 
artillery rounds in to the water near the North Korean vessel.

South Korean officials speaking on 
condition of anonymity said their vessel deliberately missed the North's
 warship as it only fired the shells to determine its rival's level of 
aggression.

They were hoping
 to establish whether the North Korean ship had been firing a warning 
shot and deliberately missed, or if the shells had in fact been intended to hit 
them.

Officials said that 
residents on the frontline Yeonpyeong Island - which belongs to South 
Korea - were evacuated to shelters, and fishing ships in the area were 
ordered to return to ports.

In 2010, North Korea fired artillery at the island, killing two civilians and two marines. 

Anger: On Tuesday, South Korean navy ships fired warning shots to repel three North Korean warships that briefly violated the disputed sea boundary. Yesterday, Kim Jong-un (centre) vowed to retaliate

Kang
 Myeong-sung, a Yeonpyeong resident, said in a phone interview that 
hundreds of residents were in underground shelters after loudspeakers 
ordered them there.

He heard the sound of artillery fire and said many people felt uneasy at first but later began to stop worrying.

Both Koreas regularly conduct artillery drills in the disputed waters.

The
 sea boundary is not clearly marked, and the area has been the scene of 
three bloody naval skirmishes between the rival countries since 1999. 

North
 Korea has in recent weeks conducted a string of artillery drills and 
missile tests and has unleashed a torrent of racist and sexist rhetoric 
at the leaders of the U.S. and South Korea.

On
 Tuesday, South Korean navy ships fired warning shots to repel three 
North Korean warships that briefly violated the disputed sea boundary.

Yesterday, North Korea's military vowed to retaliate. 

North
 Korean military ships and fishing boats have routinely intruded into 
South Korean-controlled waters that the North doesn't recognize.

The Yellow Sea boundary was unilaterally drawn by the U.S.-led U.N. Command at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.
