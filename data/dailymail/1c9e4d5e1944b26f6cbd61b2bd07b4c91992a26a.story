On Saturday evening, when Raheem Sterling walks out of his favourite club, he should settle for a quiet night in to watch El Clasico.

After Hull at home he should put his feet up to watch two of the best left wingers in world football play in the biggest fixture going. Cristiano Ronaldo versus Neymar will be an education.

After Sterling’s nocturnal visit to London’s trendy Cirque le Soir in London, just 24 hours after England’s victory over Estonia, the most important club in his career is Liverpool.

The attitude of a superstar, a genuine world beater, is to put all that stuff off until he is finished with football in his mid-thirties.

That’s what Ronaldo did when he committed his mind, body and soul to the sport when he arrived at Manchester United at the age of 17. Look how it has paid off.

On Wednesday night, in the seductive colours of the ten time European champions Real Madrid, Ronaldo taught Sterling how to play that role down the left. In short he was magnificent and was clapped off by the Liverpool fans when he was substituted.

When Karim Benzema scored Real’s third, Sterling stood hands on hips and wondered out loud how Liverpool could ever get a grip on this game.

This is the world’s best football team and it was a privilege to watch them take Liverpool apart in this Champions League group game.

When one cog in the wheel of the world’s best football team isn’t functioning, they simply turn to another expensive piece of machinery to do the job.

Ronaldo, Toni Kroos, James Rodriguez, Isco and Luka Modric turned the screw at will. Liverpool? They just feed Sterling.

It is impossible to rely on him alone, to think that a kid of 19 can handle the responsibility and pressure of trying to win a game against one of the best club teams we have ever seen.

To his credit, Brendan Rodgers is doing his best to shield him from the spotlight after a series of events that would affect even the most stable teenager.

‘It comes with his rise that people might want to knock him, but he is focused,’ claimed Liverpool’s manager.

‘For Raheem Sterling, at 19 years of age and six days before a game, people are saying he can’t go out? That’s not right.’ At least Sterling was willing, running his guts out down the left and trying to make up for losing possession by haring back down the touchline. There was admiration from Carlo Ancelotti, the man who made the European Cup happen last season on that dramatic night against Atletico Madrid in Estadio da Luz.

‘The position of Sterling and sometimes Balotelli was important, they tried to attack us and they were dangerous,’ admitted Ancelotti.

‘After we scored the three goals they were a little bit down mentally and it was easier for us.’ The fact that Sterling was probably Liverpool’s most influential player on this wretched night for Brendan Rodgers and his teams says so much about his standing in this team.

There will come a time when Sterling controls the Liverpool tempo again, learning to juggle his responsibilities to club and country as he makes his way through the game.

‘Raheem was playing in a position that was a little bit alien to him,’ added Rodgers. ‘He coped well and he did well.’

Sterling must learn from the likes of Ronaldo and co with the pressure on him now amplified

There were shouts, legitimate ones, that he should have earned a free-kick when he drew a foul from Alvaro Arbeloa on the edge of the area after six minutes.

The Kop were off their seats in expectation again midway through the first half when he somehow held on to the ball and made his way towards the byline.

He made enough room to swing his left peg at it and get a decent enough cross over, but Liverpool were afraid to commit. You sensed that Real Madrid would be rampant here and they were. Young players, no matter how outrageous their talent, cannot carry their teams in times of trouble. It is too much to ask of them.

Sterling is young and inexperienced, and it is a man’s job to guide a team through a crisis.

He did ok, nothing special here. Real Madrid were far too good to let Sterling, or any other Liverpool player for that matter, make an impact on this game.

The one time he got away in the first half he drew a foul from Toni Kroos, a clumsy challenge that earned the German midfielder a booking.

Still, what a place to learn. He discovered how cute defenders are at the very highest level when Pepe pinched the ball off his toes at the start of the second half.

In the Premier League he would have held on to the ball and been able to spin off his marker. There was no chance of Pepe letting him get away with that here.

Even after the break, when Rodgers switched his tactics and played without a recognised central striker, Real Madrid were impenetrable.

Arbeloa, who kept Sterling subdued, will be marking Neymar at the weekend when Barcelona arrive at the Bernabeu for the primero Clasico of the season.

No-one, not even Raheem, can tire of watching Real Madrid.
