A 58-year-old man has been freed from jail on bond after appearing in court on charges he held his sister captive inside their Connecticut home for years.

Arthur Gauvin was ordered on Wednesday to wear a monitoring device and stay 100 yards from the victim and her family.

He said nothing as he left the courthouse after posting $125,000 bond, according to The Connecticut Post.

Police say Gauvin's 56-year-old sister was found last month inside their Seymour home. 

The frail, malnourished woman was covered
 in urine and human feces when police conducting a welfare check found 
her, according to Paul Satkowski, deputy chief of the 
Seymour police.

A lock was on the outside of her bedroom door and the 
room's windows were blacked out with paint.

Police went to the house after an anonymous caller expressed concerns about the woman's welfare.

Neighbors told police that they had suspicions about the way the woman was being treated, according to recently-released court documents seen by The Courant.

Neighbors told officers last month that a few years ago, the woman broke through a window at the squalid home and crawled to a nearby house 'begging for food'.

The neighbors who reported the incident asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.

Arthur Gauvin 
was arrested and charged with unlawful restraint, reckless endangerment 
and cruelty to persons. The brother and sister lived in the same house 
with other relatives including children.

Gauvin also is charged with threatening a family member who was preparing to speak with police.

Veteran police officer Lisa Wexler 
described a frail, starving woman covered head-to-toe with feces and 
urine who sat in a room so foul officers couldn’t breathe. They had to 
leave and call in a colleague wearing a hazardous material suit with an 
air pack to explore the room.

'Your
 eyes immediately watered. The smell … awful. We had to change uniforms 
after leaving because the stench was in them,' Wexler said. 'I
 served on the New Haven police force for 22 years before retiring and 
coming here last July. I never saw anything like this in my years with 
New Haven. I was absolutely shocked.'

The
 woman was recovering at Yale-New Haven Hospital from 
what police said was neglect by her caretaker - her brother, Arthur 
Gauvin.

'Officers and 
detectives have determined the motive for Gauvin keeping the victim 
locked up inside the house was so he wouldn’t lose the house to the 
state of Connecticut,' Deputy Chief Paul Satkowski said.

The window to the tiny room where the 56-year-old woman lived was blacked out so neighbors couldn't see in

Detectives learned that the victim had
 owned the house once, and that ownership was transferred to Arthur 
Gauvin seven years ago. He was required to care for his sister for a 
total of nine years before the state would begin providing her any 
services, Satkowski said.

The exact details of the home ownership issue are still being sought by investigators, he said.

Satkowski,
 at the post-arraignment news conference, said officers had been called 
to the home for minor issues in 2010 and 2012, and found no evidence of 
anything wrong.

Officers saw and talked with the sister both times, and 
she appeared normal, and conditions in the home were not unusual, he 
said.

The tiny bedroom - its sole window 
painted black, nailed shut with boards and locked tight from the outside
 - was 'kept like a dungeon,' he said in the news release distributed 
after Gauvin’s arrest.

Gauvin,
 who police said has no previous criminal record, was arrested twice on one night last month. The first time was on charges that he imprisoned and was
 criminally cruel to his sister.

The
 second time was on threatening and witness tampering charges because he
 allegedly warned his daughter, who was waiting for him in the police 
station lobby, not to talk to police or he would kick her and her young 
daughter out of the house.

The
 younger woman, 33, told police later she had often questioned her 
father’s poor care of the victim, saw continued mistreatment of her and 
was 'petrified' by her own father’s threat that he would toss her and 
his own six-year-old grandchild out of the home if she cooperated in the
 investigation.

An officer in a hazmat suit was brought in to explore the room the woman was kept in after responding officers were forced to leave because the smell was so bad

The
 daughter and grandchild lived in the home with Gauvin and the 
imprisoned sister. Police also said two young men, friends of the 
daughter, rented space in the basement because they had no other place 
to live.

Satkowski said 
the state Department of Children and Families had joined police in 
reviewing the case.

Nancy
 Phillips, who lives nearby and had bought a dog several years ago from 
Arthur Gauvin, said she walked by the Eleanor Road home about a year ago
 and saw a woman standing in the bedroom, looking out the window. 
Phillips said she thought it might be Gauvin’s sister and asked people 
in Gauvin’s yard how 'the girl in the bedroom' was doing.

Not
 long after that, when Phillips next walked past the house, she said the
 bedroom window was painted black and the air conditioning unit in the 
window was gone.

'I should 
have said something,' Phillips said, sitting in a parked car 
outside the Gauvin home before leaving on an errand. 'I always saw him 
sitting on the front steps, drinking. Never saw her again.'
