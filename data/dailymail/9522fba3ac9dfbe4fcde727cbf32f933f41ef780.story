Golf's bad boy Dustin Johnson and his fiance Paulina Gretzky have had their first child, it was reported today.

Paulina Gretzky - the daughter of NHL legend Wayne - gave birth to a boy on Monday just outside Los Angeles.

However, the child's name is yet to be revealed, with the only detail known being that it starts with a 'T', it was reported by TMZ.

It comes as 30-year-old Johnson hit back at claims he was twice suspended from golf for cocaine abuse and said he is turning over a new leaf.

It was previously claimed the couple's baby was due next month after Paulina revealed on Christmas Day on her Instagram that she was having a boy.

Back in action: Dustin Johnson has been on an inexplicable five-month hiatus from the PGA Tour after he was rumored to have been suspended over drug use - something he denies

Johnson gave an extended interview to Golf.com in which he admitted he's working to clean up his act and 'simplify' his life since leaving the PGA Tour five months ago. 

He says he's been spending a great deal of time with Paulina's father - NHL legend Wayne Gretzky - who lives just half a mile down the road from Johnson's home on the Sherwood Country Club. 

Gretzky has been coaching Johnson, a kid from a divorced family in South Carolina, on how to cope with his fame and fortune - he's made more than $25million off PGA Tour wins alone.

Golf.com previously reported that Johnson was disciplined three times by the PGA - twice for testing positive for cocaine and once for marijuana. The site reported that he is serving a six-month suspension from the PGA Tour as a result of his last drug test.

When asked about the allegations, Johnson flatly denied them.

'I did not have a problem. It’s just something I’m not going to get into. I have issues. But that’s not the issue,' he said.

We couldn’t be happier for the new parents Paulina Gretzky and Dustin Johnson on the news that they have had a baby boy.

What we are going to miss however, is Paulina’s maternity wear wardrobe, a girl who can pull of Herve Leger at 8 months pregnant gets some serious fashion points from us!

What is a lot easier to pull off with a baby bump however, is sportswear. The endlessly stretchy spandex of running tights and tank tops mean you don’t even have to buy maternity specific pieces, which is great for when you want to get back into shape postpartum.

We’re loving these mesh panel cut-out leggings that Paulina took a photo of herself wearing a few weeks ago.

Designed by Lululemon, you can buy Paulina’s running tights if you follow the link on the right. Or alternatively, check out the options below starting from just $29.95. Now where’s that gym card…

Paulina and Johnson made names for themselves for the jetset lifestyle and frequent social media posts

However, he admitted to drinking too much. His booze of choice - Grey Goose and soda with lime. 

 'I don’t miss waking up with a hangover, and I didn’t drink very often. It was just when I did it was a little too much,' he told Golf.com. 

The talented golfer also denied reports that he had been to rehab - saying he hired a 'life coach' and a team of clinicians to hep him 'simplify' his life. However, he said he never underwent treatment for any addiction.

Johnson revealed he's abstained from booze for January - ponying up $1,000 with Wayne Gretzky and several friends from the Sherwood Country Club as part of a bet to stay off alcohol for a month.

He claims he's also selling his two Jet Skis, one of his boats and his $300,000 Aston Martin. He gave his souped-up 1976 Pontiac to his brother - all in an attempt to rid himself of distractions. 

Johnson says he plans to end his golf hiatus and return to the PGA Tour either at Torrey Pines in La Jolla, California, on February 5, or the following week at Pebble Beach.
