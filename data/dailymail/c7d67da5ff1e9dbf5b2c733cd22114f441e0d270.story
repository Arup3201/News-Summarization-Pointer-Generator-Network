A British tourist who
lost her left leg when a taxi jumped the curb and hit her in New York's
Rockefeller Center during the summer is suing the city for over $27 
million.

Sian Green's decision to sue follows last month's announcement
by the assistant district attorney investigating the case not to bring 
criminal charges against cabbie Faysal Himon.

Green's $27.5 million city claim says that the driver's hack license should have been suspended before the August 20 
accident because he had prior driving violations.

The city Taxi and Limousine Commission has cited a now-fixed computer problem for the error.

Green had to have her left leg amputated after Himon lost control of his cab and
slammed into her, severing her foot, outside the Rockefeller Center on August 
20.

Himon maintains that the accident wasn't his fault and that he lost 
control after a cyclist slammed the hood of his cab.

Prosecutors told Green in November that there wasn't 
enough evidence to demonstrate that Himon intended to hit Green. He has now served a 
30-day suspension issued by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission.

The
city Law Department has said it is reviewing Green's claim, she filed 
what is called a notice of claim against the city in November.

On Tuesday her lawyer Daniel Marchese announced that other parties also might face lawsuits.

Vivacious: Green's attorney stated that since returning home to the UK, the 23-year-old has been making great progress in her recovery

Reckless: The Green family are convinced that the incident that left Sian (left) without a leg was not an accident, but rather the result of a negligent act

After it was announced in the November that no criminal charges would be brought against Himon, Green's lawyer released a statement in which he said his client was continuing to make progress in her recovery after returning to the U.K.

‘While
she is incredibly dismayed by this decision, she does not let it affect
her positive spirit, unbelievable strength and incredible poise, which 
she demonstrated to the world throughout this ordeal,’ the statement 
from Marchese read.

He insists that
the incident that has left his young client without a leg is not an 
accident, but rather the result of ‘a negligent act of calculated 
recklessness.’

In an interview on the Today Show in September, Green, of Leicester, U.K., said she plans to return to New York someday.

She said: 'I hope to come back one day. It’s not the city’s 
fault. It was the man who made a bad choice, I can’t blame the city for 
that.  It’s a beautiful city and I’d love to come back.'

Investigation: No charges were filed against the taxi driver in the incident, who reportedly lost control of car after an argument with a cyclist and ploughed into Miss Green

The aspiring model told the New York Post after being discharged from the hospital that she will not let the horrific incident 
destroy her dreams.

Green's
Facebook account shows that the 23-year-old woman has been keeping 
busy, spending time with friends and attending parties.

One
picture posted in October showed the 23-year-old employee of the Hugo 
Boss fashion house posing in a green dress with a pair of girlfriends at
a soiree while holding onto a walker. 

The crash happened on the second day of her trip to the city and she did not get to do the things she wanted.

'The only thing I really wanted to do was go to the top of the Empire 
State Building,' she said. 'I wanted to go shopping, meet up with a few friends, do the 
typical New York things.'

Hero: Green said if it wasn't for the actions of strangers who rushed to help she wouldn't have survived the accident. David Justino (right) used a belt to make a tourniquet for her leg, while celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz (left) also raced to the scene

Passersby rushed to help Miss Green 
immediately after the incident. Plumber David Justino used his belt to 
make a life-saving tourniquet for her leg while a pizza truck owner 
raced to put her foot on ice.

They
were also helped by celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, better known on U.S. TV
as Dr Oz, who hurried to the scene from his nearby office.

Her appearance in the Today studio took place just one block from the scene of the crash.

During
her appearance on the Today show, Green admitted that she had had 
some unpleasant flashbacks: 'I haven't been out in five weeks. It takes 
me back a little bit, even when I see a yellow car.... But I'll get 
there.'

The 23-year-old 
brunette, who appeared in a wheelchair with what remains of her left leg
bandaged, told the show of her memories of the accident.

'I couldn't move,' she said. 'It was one of those things. If I had gone left, it would have 
gotten me, if I had gone right, it would've gotten me.'

Aspirations: Sian Green hoped to become a model and was training to be a buyer for Hugo Boss

Driver
Faysal Kabir Mohammad Himon of Queens, New York, 24, has been charged 
with seven traffic violations in the last three years.

He
is believed to have gotten into an argument with cyclist Kenneth Olivo,
40, who reportedly also has a criminal history, just before the crash.

Friends and relatives say Green's naturally good-spirited nature has helped her through a hard time.

'It's quite difficult, but she's a very optimistic person,' Sian's sister Stacey told Today. 'She just takes it day by day.'

Green said her most vivid memory of the day 
is walking around the city, getting a drink, going to Times Square and 
having a great time with her best friend, Keshia Warren.

Miss
Green paid tribute to her friend, who was with her during the accident 
and hasn't left her side since. 'She's been my rock,' Green said. 'I 
couldn't do half the things without her, I really couldn't.'
