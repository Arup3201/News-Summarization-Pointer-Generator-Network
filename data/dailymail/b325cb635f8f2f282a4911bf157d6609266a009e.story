Red-coloured sprouts are also being trialled at the company's site in Lincolnshire

The vegetable that most sharply divides opinion around the family dinner table is to get a flavour makeover in an ambitious bid to boost its popularity, according to a new report yesterday.

Generations of children have groaned at the appearance of Brussels sprouts on their plate at mealtimes and determinedly pushed the leafy green vegetable to one side.

But now a major new campaign is being launched to shake up the healthy sprout market and introduce a variety of different tastes to the leafy green vegetables.

Trade magazine The Grocer said yesterday: 'The humble sprout is being given a makeover with new flavour strengths, and even colours, in a bid to encourage more Brits to eat the much maligned vegetable.'da

It reports that Produce World, a major supplier of brassicas and other vegetables to leading high street supermarket chains, is running field trials of mild-tasting and strong-tasting sprouts at its site in Butterwick, Lincolnshire.

The new sprouts would be harvested later this year and if they performed well in taste tests, were likely to be grown commercially next year and could be on store shelves by Christmas 2014.

Dara O'Doherty, new product development manager at Produce World told the magazine: 'We are just trying to make people aware and increase the marketing around sprouts and increase the fixture in store.'

She said that strong-tasting sprouts would appeal to the 'sprout traditionalists.'

Red-coloured sprouts are also being trialled and the firm already commercially grows the Flower Sprout - a cross between the Brussels sprout and kale, for a major retailer.

The company is also trialling a new type of brassica that can be used both as a lettuce and as a cabbage.

It is milder in flavour than cabbage but stronger than a lettuce, as well as red-veined cavolo nero and coloured kales.

Sprouts became part of our staple 'meat and two veg' diet during and after the Second World War mainly due to rationing, but in the 80s and 90s their popularity was affected by changes in our eating habits and increasingly exotic diets.

They also bore the brunt of schoolboy jokes which helped dampen the enthusiasm of an entire generation that led to general sales, outside of the Christmas market, falling into decline through the 90s.Â 

However, sprout popularity rose again during the noughties as a result of them often being used in recipes and TV cookery programmes by celebrity chefs.

It is estimated that as much as 80 per cent of total British sprout sales take place in the two week Christmas and New Year period.
