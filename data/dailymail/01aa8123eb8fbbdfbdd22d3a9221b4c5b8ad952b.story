Celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred would be 'very impressed' with Donald Trump’s manhood according to....the man himself.

He made the boast as part of the ongoing saga over the transsexual beauty queen Jenna Talackova, who was thrown out of Miss Universe Canada last month - before being allowed to compete again this week.

The organization now argues that Talackova was disqualified for lying in her application form but initially - before the media backlash - they said she was kicked out because she was not born a woman.

Today, Allred argued that her beauty queen client had not challenged Trump, who owns the pageant, to prove that he was a naturally-born man or to display his genitals.

All woman: Gloria Allred argued her transgendered client - who was thrown out of a beauty pageant owned by Donald Trump - never asked to see Donald Trump's genitals

'Very impressed': Trump has boasted that the celebrity lawyer would be 'very impressed' if he were to show off his manhood to her - 'she would have a whole new image of Donald Trump,' he added

Talackova and Allred held a press 
conference today where the lawyer argued that her client 'didn’t ask Mr.
Trump to prove he's a naturally born man, or see photos of his birth, 
or to view his anatomy ... It made no difference to her.'

But Trump appears keen to prove his manhood and called TMZ to say Gloria would be ‘very, very, very, very impressed’ if he were to display his genitals.

‘I think she would have a whole new image of Donald Trump,’ he continued.

During the phone call the billionaire refused to apologise to Talackova and repeated that she would be allowed to come back into the competition – but added that ‘he couldn’t care less’ if she competes.

Proof: Talackova holds up her passport which declares her as a 'female'

The comments are likely to enrage the 
high-powered lawyer who is famous for taking the cases of celebrity 
clients including several of Tiger Woods’ ex-lovers and Nicole Brown 
Simpson’s family during the O.J. Simpson murder trial.

Jenna Talackova, 23, was thrown out of the pageant, founded by Donald Trump, when organisers found out she had undergone surgery to become a woman.

Officials denied charges of discrimination and said the reason why a male-to-female transgender contestant could not compete was because Miss Talackova lied on her application form.

However Miss Universe authorities have appeared to have a change of heart after claiming the young woman had been 'dishonest'.

Rethink: Transgendered Miss Universe Canada finalist Jenna Talackova has been allowed back into the competition

Michael D Cohen, executive vice president and special counsel to Donald Trump, wrote in an email to ABC: 'The Miss Universe Organization will allow Jenna Talackova to compete in the 2012 Miss Universe Canada pageant provided she meets the legal gender recognition requirements of Canada, and the standards established by other international competitions.'

The transgendered contestant had already successfully reached the finals in the Miss Vancouver pageant before she was banned from continuing in the competition.

After becoming suspicious, director Denis Davila questioned Ms Talackova, 23, who said that, even though she written on her application that she had been born a female, that was not the case.

'We have to have the facts straight. There is no discrimination here at all,' Mr Davila said.

'You can look at it the way she wants to look at it, but we all have to follow the same rules.'

Following her expulsion from the competition, organizers faced much criticism with many fans saying that they were blatantly discriminatory.

Over 20,000 people signed a virtual petition on Change.org calling for organizers to reverse their decision.

The original decision from the Miss Universe Canada pageant sparked outrage with people calling for Jenna to be reinstated into the contest.

People took to social media pages to express their disgust with one Facebook user writing on the pageant's page: 'Tell us what "requirements" did she not make? This reeks of discrimination...'

In a YouTube interview, Miss Talackova has said she knew she was a female at the age of four and began hormone therapy ten years later.

A
veteran beauty pageant competitor, who has participated in Miss 
Universe pageants before, Miss Talackova surgically changed 
her gender aged 19.

‘I regard myself as a woman with a history,’ she said, winking to the camera.

The only requirements stated on the Miss Universe Canada website is that to enter, women must be a Canadian citizen and between the ages of 18 and 27.

The application made no mention of rules regarding sexual reassignment surgery.
