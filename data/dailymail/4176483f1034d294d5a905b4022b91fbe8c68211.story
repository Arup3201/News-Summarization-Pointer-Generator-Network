Greece was holding out for a ray of economic hope yesterday after Athens went up in flames as MPs voted for a savage austerity bill.

Early indications were that the markets, at least, were happy, with the FTSE 100 index leaping 53.31 points to 5905.7 in London – its strongest close since late July.

It came after Greek politicians backed a package of unpopular cuts in exchange for a £110billion rescue from the European Union and International Monetary Fund.

But despite the surge in the markets, 
popular anger simmered as Athens cleaned up after almost 100 buildings 
were set alight by rioters while parliament voted on Sunday night.

The stench of tear gas still hung in 
the air yesterday as firefighters doused smouldering buildings and 
rubble was swept from the streets after a night of violence during which
 stores and cafes were smashed and looted.

At least 170 people were hurt as riot
 police clashed with more than 2,000 black-hooded anarchists carrying 
clubs and petrol bombs. Police arrested at least 74 people and detained a
 further 92.

The sight of flames engulfing cinemas,
 shops and banks in the capital underscored the sense of deepening 
turmoil in the country after more than four years of recession and two 
of punishing austerity.

Riots also spread to the second city,Thessaloniki, and even the holiday islands of Crete and Corfu.

The proposed austerity package 
includes cuts in pay, jobs and pensions, with the state workforce 
reduced by 150,000 by 2015 and the minimum wage slashed by 22 per cent.

Greece needs its bailout cash by March 20 so it can meet debt repayments of £12billion and prevent a chaotic default that would send shockwaves through the eurozone.

The austerity bill was welcomed by investors and stock markets across Europe amid hopes that a eurozone meltdown will be avoided. ‘Greece has passed a major hurdle in voting for more austerity and in doing so averting a messy default,’ said Jane Foley, a currency analyst at Rabobank International.

‘Greece’s crisis, however, will continue to play out for years. There appears to be a growing sense that a European monetary union without Greece may eventually become politically acceptable.’

The vote paves the way for Greece's international creditors to release 130 billion euro in new rescue loans to prevent the country from a potentially catastrophic default next month. Bankruptcy could push Greece out of Europe's euro currency union, drag down other troubled eurozone countries and further roil global markets.

There was nevertheless strong dissent over the austerity package among the majority Socialists and rival Conservatives who make up Greece's interim coalition government.

The parties disciplined the dissenters in their ranks, with the Socialists and Conservatives expelling 22 and 21 lawmakers respectively, reducing their majority in the 300-member parliament from 236 to 193.

Germany gave the vote result a cautious welcome, with Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle describing it as 'a first significant step along the right road'. He said: 'However, the actual difficult work with implementing the reforms that have been agreed on is only just starting now.

'That is the decisive precondition for Germany and the other euro partners being able to stand by Greece with a further rescue package. Embarking on implementation is decisive now.'

'These decisions show the will and readiness of the Greeks to make great efforts of their own ... to put the country on the right track,' German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said in Berlin.

He said: 'These measures, and we really have to note this, are not just saving for the sake of saving, they are not cutting for the sake of cutting - this is about reforms in every political area.

'These are measures that are meant to restore step by step the financial room for manoeuvre that the country needs for new jobs and new growth to emerge.'

Germany's vice chancellor and economy minister, Philipp Roesler, also said the vote was 'a step in the right direction'.

He said: 'It is good that the legislation has now been approved, with a broad majority too, but what is decisive is the implementation of structural reforms.

'The legislative process is one thing, implementation is another - I would like to recall again that there have been tax laws for a long time and the fact that they were not adhered to sensibly is part of the problem.'

Roesler noted that the upcoming report by Greece's international debt inspectors from the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, known as the 'troika', will be key to determining whether the measures Athens has taken suffice to allow the country to carry its debts and get further aid.

He said: 'The pressure that Germany built up in Europe was right in order at least to move Greece further in this right direction.' Sunday's clashes erupted after more than 100,000 protesters marched to the parliament to rally against the drastic cuts.

'There's no question that there's quite a lot of anger in the population. There is quite a lot of frustration,' said social and economic analyst Panos Tsakloglou. 'However I do not think that these rioters represent all these demonstrators that were mostly peaceful yesterday.'

And the European Commission also welcomed the Greek parliament's decision to approve tough new austerity measures.

Economics commissioner Olli Rehn urged Greek officials to 'take ownership' and fully implement the reforms, demanded by the EU in return for a huge bailout.

The new bailout deal, which has not yet been finalised, will be combined with a massive bond swap deal to write off half the country's privately held debt, reducing Greece's debt load by about 100 billion euro.

But for both deals to materialise, Greece has to persuade its deeply sceptical creditors that it has the will to implement spending cuts and public sector reforms that will end years of fiscal profligacy and tame gaping budget deficits.

Eurozone finance ministers are to meet on Wednesday to approve the plan, after refusing to do so during a meeting last week, saying Athens had to first approve the new austerity measures.

Before signing off on the bailout, the eurozone ministers will still want Greek political leaders to commit in writing to uphold the austerity plan even after the general election in April. Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos insisted the country's economic survival hinged on the passage of the new measures.

'The question is not whether some salaries and pensions will be curtailed, but whether we will be able to pay even these reduced wages and pensions,' he said in Parliament before the vote. 'When you have to choose between bad and worse, you will pick what is bad to avoid what is worse.'

The further cuts come after two years of deep spending cuts and repeated tax hikes that have sent unemployment soaring to more than 20 per cent and left the country struggling through a fifth year of recession.

Those measures were taken in return for a first, 110 billion euro package of rescue loans from other eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund, but despite the cutbacks, Greece repeatedly failed to meet its fiscal targets in reducing its debt and deficit and increasing economic competitiveness.
