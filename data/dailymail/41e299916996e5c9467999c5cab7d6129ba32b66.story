An Orlando police officer has been fired after cell phone footage emerged of him punching and kicking a handcuffed man.

Officer William Escobar had been facing two counts of battery and two counts of perjury related to the March 2014 arrest of Refus Holloway, a former military police officer.

Police Chief John Mina announced the decision to fire Escobar on Wednesday and he said the officer had violated Orlando Police Department procedures including the use of force and treatment of prisoners.

Escobar was accused of kicking and punching Holloway, who had been trying to break up a fight, reports WFTV.

According to records from the state attorney's office, Escobar lied when he said he wasn't trying to hit the victim in the head during the incident.

Under oath Escobar said that he jumped on Holloway's legs because the man had tried to kick him.

'I proceeded to deliver two closed hand fist strikes to Holloway's back, but since he was attempting to stand up, they ultimately struck him on the upper back, neck or shoulder area,' Escobar said.

Prosecutors, however, decided Escobar was lying and his description of the event was false after viewing evidence including cell phone footage of the altercation captured by Holloway's sister.

The incident had only come to light after she posted the footage on YouTube and the Orlando Police Department announced that it would be carrying out an investigation.

Holloway, pictured above, had initially been charged with battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest, although the charges were dropped after the footage emerged
