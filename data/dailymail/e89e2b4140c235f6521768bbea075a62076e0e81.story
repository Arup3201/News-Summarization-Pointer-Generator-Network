A man accused of murdering his wife and two young daughters earlier this year is still on the run as police continue to comb a densely forested region of northern California where he is believed to be hiding.

Shane Franklyn Miller, 45, is the sole suspect in the shooting deaths of his wife Sandra Miller, 34, and their two daughters, Shelby Ann, eight, and Shasta, four.

During an intensive search of the remote, undeveloped area of redwoods and towering mountains in coastal Humbolt County in June, police discovered an underground fortress containing an arsenal of rifles, shotguns and handguns.

According to NBC, the bunker was an elaborate prefabricated structure with vent pipes hidden by wood and other debris.

Miller, considered armed and extremely dangerous, knows the tree-lined canyons of Humboldt County where he grew up well. Investigators found his pickup truck abandoned near Petrolia, about 200 miles west of the home that Miller shared with his family.

He is described as an 'avid outdoorsman' and survivalist, who has the skills to fortify himself in an area so remote it's called the 'lost coast.'

Just before 8pm on May 7, someone at the Miller home called 911. According to NBC, the dispatcher heard a woman sobbing and loud banging sounds.

Deputies who went to the house on Alpine Way in Shingleton found the doors locked and Sandra Miller and her daughters shot to death inside.

Crime scene: Police were called to the home Miller shared with his family two weeks before he murdered his wife and children

Two weeks before the shootings, police had been called to the property for a domestic dispute. Shane Miller was missing.

Sandra Miller told officers her husband was 'abusive' and deputies escorted her from the home. she drove towards her mother's house but Miller found her at a motel in Humboldt County and forced her to return to Shingleton.

'He also threatened to kill her and their daughters if she left him again,' reads the affidavit. 'On the morning of the murders, Sandra Miller told her mother that she planned on telling Miller later that day she was leaving him.'

One day later, Miller's gold 2010 Dodge Mega Cab pickup was foound in a remote area near the town of Petrolia. One week later, his dog was found wandering along the Lost Coast Trail.

In 2002, Miller was charged in San Francisco with making and selling marijuana for distribution, being a felon in possession of a firearm, possessing a machine gun and money laundering, according to court records.

He pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a gun and was sentenced to three years and 10 months in prison. He was released in May 2007, according to the federal Bureau of Prisons.

He served 46 months in federal prison for being a felon in possession of a firearm, court records show.

'It would be easy to hide out up there,' said local resident Phil Franklin, one of hundreds ordered to lock doors and shelter in place in the early days of the manhunt.

A sheriff's investigator said Miller's retreat into the mountainous woods creates a dangerous situation for officers trying to track him.

'It's almost like warfare,' said Lieutenant Dave Kent of the Shasta County Sheriff's Office, which is handling the investigation.

To imagine the ruggedness of the landscape think 'Jurrasic Park' - some of the movie was filmed there. Many residents live off the grid on unmarked back roads often shrouded in a coastal fog.

Authorities say Miller is familiar with the tree-lined canyons so steep that only one paved, pot-holed road serves the area.

Like Franklin, most of the residents are armed because law enforcement patrols are rare in this community built on a peninsula that juts into the Pacific.

'The county is strapped for money so we don't have police protection out here. We all contact each other if something occurs so we can coordinate help,' Franklin said.

Authorities believed at one point that Miller may have purchased property in Oregon under an assumed name and fled there after the killings. A separate court filing also speculates that Miller may have gone to Mexico.

Now the search has returned to the area Miller is most familiar with.

'He better hope that the police get hold of him before a lot of the guys around here, because they would just as soon tar and feather him and string him up,' Vera De Witt, president of a local non-profit raising money for a memorial for the girls, told NBC News.

She said the killings had shocked the community, which is still reeling seven months on.

Painful questions arose, she said, especially among local children.

'Particularly,' she said, 'little girls going home and asking, "Daddy, would you kill me, would you shoot me?"'

She has established memorial trees at the elementary school and preschool where Shelby Ann and Shasta Miller were educated. A third was planted outside the local library and excess money raised for the trees was donated.

'The trees will always be there, along with the books,' she told NBC.

Since the killings and Miller's disappearance, police have received thousands of tip-offs from the public, but none has led to Miller.

He remains at large and has been placed on the FBI's Most Wanted list with a $25,000 reward for information leading to his capture.
