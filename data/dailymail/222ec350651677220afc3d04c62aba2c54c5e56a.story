Aaron Ramsey and Mikel Arteta are both predicting more Arsenal silverware success after they picked up the Community Shield by beating Manchester City 3-0 at Wembley.

The Welsh midfielder grabbed the Gunners' second goal as they put the Premier League champions to the sword, putting their 'big game' problems from last season behind them.

Arsenal lost heavily to Chelsea, Liverpool and their Community Shield opponents during last year's campaign but Ramsey says they are now ready to fix up their problems to bring more trophies to North London.

'Wembley's not been a bad place for me or Santi (Cazorla) so we want to play here every week,' Ramsey said. 

'In these games last season we have been guilty of conceding early on. It's difficult enough so it was important today for us to stay in the game, wait for them too open up, and we capitalised on that.'

And Ramsey says Arsenal are in the best shape they he has seen in his six years at The Emirates. 

'We’re more than capable - the team has a good team spirit. We need to improve on the big games so hopefully now we’ve learnt our lesson, we can go into this season and have a good go.

Vincent Kompany missed the Community Shield defeat to Arsenal but later tweeted:

'Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose but what remains is the chance to do better another day.. Cannot wait for the Prem to start. #MCFC' 

'I'm feeling good. The atmosphere has been the best since I've been at Arsenal.

'We really get on well, we want to work hard for each other and the club is on the up now so everybody’s really excited.

'I feel like after we’ve won the FA Cup, now this, the club is on the up so hopefully we can continue this success in the coming years.'

And Gunners captain Mikel Arteta agreed with his midfield partner.

'We're looking very good,' he said. 'We've made some very good signings and it's only going to strengthen the team.

'We've got a few still on holiday but you look at the bench and the options are there to change the game. It's really impressive so hopefully it's going to be another great season. We’ve started well.'
