The driver of a tanker containing thousands of gallons of fuel spent two days in his cab after his satnav led him up a blind alley and the vehicle got wedged in a tiny country lane.

An on-board GPS system linked to satellites gave the driver of the 40ft long tanker the wrong directions and he ended up stuck between two hedges on the road at Tutton Hill near the village of Colerne in Wiltshire.

But despite his plight, the driver appeared to be perfectly happy to spend two days in his tanker - turning down an offer by police to take him to a hotel while they figured out how to remove the HGV and its gallons of fuel. 

Police were left scratching their heads for two days after a 40ft HGV got wedged between hedges in a narrow country road in Wiltshire and could not be moved, the driver of the tanker spent two days in the cab 

A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said today 'We offered to take him to a local hotel but he said he could get provisions by walking to the village's Co-Op store, and he had a TV and heater in his cab.'

The driver had been trying to deliver fuel at a nearby Ministry of Defence base when it got stuck.  

Officers were left scratching their heads for a solution to remove the tanker after recovery vehicles were unable to drag it clear when it rolled back down the hill and got wedged between the hedges, completely blocking the lane.

They considered using a police helicopter and spent two days trying to work out how to remove it before they decided to remove some of the fuel to make the vehicle light enough so they could tow it. 

PCSO Shaun Redmond from Corsham police station said 'At one point we were considering using a police helicopter to try to release the tanker.

'Its size, weight and location meant it was proving a struggle to get it out  using our standard recovery trucks.'

Meanwhile the driver of the HGV was left looking at the rolling hills and wildlife for two days.  

Wiltshire councillor Dick Tonge, who lives on Tutton Hill, said today 'It happens all the time so we are used to it.

'People follow their satnavs to cut through to get to the base, but I've never heard of one being stuck for two days before.'

The police spokmesman added 'We want to remind HGV drivers to follow road signs and that Tutton Hill is unsuitable for HGVs.'
