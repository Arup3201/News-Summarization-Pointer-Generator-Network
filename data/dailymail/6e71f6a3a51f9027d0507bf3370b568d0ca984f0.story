It is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty and plunges thrillseekers 41 storeys at speeds of up to 90 miles per hour.

Now the first terrifying video has been released showing screaming riders tackling Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom at Six Flags Great Adventure theme park in New Jersey.

Taller than Big Ben and double the size of the Statue of Liberty, the world's tallest and fastest drop ride hoisted its first riders into the sky on Independence Day and sent them freefalling down to ground level in less than 10 seconds.

Don't look down! The first video shows just how terrifying Zumanjaro is

The three soaring towers, each with eight-person gondolas, blasts riders 415ft into the air in just 30 seconds.

It
 then pauses for a few terrifying moments at peak so people can catch a 
glimpse of the skyscrapers of Philadelphia 52 miles to the south, before
 plunging back to the ground.

The ride will reach the same speed as a female cheetah - the fastest animal in the world - chases her prey.

Breathtaking: Zumanjaro will drop brave riders 41 stories at 90mph. At the top, they'll be able to see the skyline of Philadelphia 52 miles away

Zumanjaro
 opened America's most important holiday and is connected to the iconic 
Kingda Ka — the 456ft monster that ranks as the world's tallest and 
fastest coaster in North America.

As the rollercoaster thunders above at speeds of us to 128mph, riders on Zumanjaro wait for their epic drop.

Theme park super fans have already flocked to Six Flags to capture videos of the ride being tested, showing the speed at which the gondolas free-fall from the dramatic height.

The ride uses a massive 5,551ft of cable, a grand total of 26,502 bolts and has enough steel structuring reinforcing columns added to equal the weight of 32 massive African elephants

Mammoth rides: Zumanjaro and Kingda Ka are based around the same structure

The record for tallest tower ride was previously held by the 
400ft Lex Luthor: Drop of Doom at Six Flags Magic Mountain near Los 
Angeles.

Talking about ride park president John Fitzgerald said: ‘Zumanjaro solidifies Six Flags Great Adventure’s dominance as the Northeast’s thrill capital.

'You’re going to have folks dropping 90mph.

'You’re
 going to have the Kingda Ka cars racing around them at the same time. 
It’s really going to be fantastic. Fantastic views, but also terribly 
exciting.'

Park spokesperson Kristin Siebeneicher said: ‘It's definitely exciting that we are breaking a world record.'

Mammoth: Each tower will feature a gondola for eight riders, which will help keep queues as short as possible
