When Joshua Tucker was taken to hospital after serving in Afghanistan the only thing keeping the Arizona soldier strong was knowing his military dog Ellen was waiting for him.

But just as the K9 MP finished his treatment for injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder, the Armed Forces called his wife, Sherie, to say the dog had been moved.

What followed was an extraordinary effort over three years, involving the Army, Air Force and Congress to reunite Tucker with the dog that meant so much to him.

The black Labrador Ellen was finally tracked down to a base in Germany, and the pair shared an emotional reunion last month after the Army agreed to hand her over.

For Tucker, it was the moment he had been waiting for since he was medically retired in 2011. 'They gave me my life back,' he told the Army Times.

Not being able to see his dog, who had accompanied him on dangerous missions since 2009, was hard for Tucker.

'We had no idea he would never see her 
again. They never let him say goodbye. ... I lost the man 
that my husband was,' his wife said.

She explained that when he returned from his last tour in Afghanistan he was 'banged up quite a bit' and only agreed to treatment because he believed it meant he would get to work with his dog again.

But the day before he was due to leave hospital, Mrs Tucker received a phone call asking her to break the news to her husband that he wouldn't see Ellen again.

'To have to sit there and look my husband in the eye and say "I don’t know how to tell you this, but she’s gone",’  It was like telling him that our child just died,' she told Spouse Buzz.

Refusing to give up on Ellen, the couple began a complicated journey to find the dog and adopt her.

The search took them from the Joint Base Lewis-McChord base in Washington to the Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, before finally finding that Ellen had been sent to a base in Ansbach, Germany.

The couple contacted friends stationed in Germany, who were able to confirm Ellen was there by checking a tattoo in her ear.

Tucker thought his dream of seeing Ellen had finally been realized, but despite a program to let soldiers wounded in combat adopt their service dogs, the Army declined his request.

Refusing to give up, the couple enlisted the help of Arizona representative Krysten Sinema, who sent letters to the Army insisting Ellen be retired.

On February 20, Tucker finally got the call he had been waiting for, when a member of the Army stationed in Europe told him: 'She's yours.'

Ellen was flown to the U.S. and the pair had an emotional reunion in a hotel, where the dog charged into Tucker's arms as soon as she saw him.

'It was kinda like seeing someone come back from the dead,' he told Fox News.

His wife said seeing Ellen had an immediate affect on her husband, adding: 'I watched his eyes change back ... They gave a soldier his life back.'

The couple took Ellen to meet Congresswoman Sinema this week, and to thank her for her help.

She said: 'Spc Tucker and Ellen served our country valiantly in Afghanistan, and Spc Tucker has paid a dear price for that service, returning home with PTSD.

'Reuniting Spc Tucker with his best friend and prior service dog Ellen was the right thing to do and I'm so glad that our office was a part of this happy reunion.'
