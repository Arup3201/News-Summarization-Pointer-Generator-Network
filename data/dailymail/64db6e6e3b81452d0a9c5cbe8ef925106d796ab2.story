I understand that the Western Force split into two teams before Monday's training session. A 1st team to play the Waratahs on Saturday, and a 2nd team to play the Lions today. That is totally pathetic.

The last time the Lions won a Test series, 16 years ago, a prolific Welsh kicker was the heart of their success. At Patersons Stadium, Neil Jenkins watched at close quarters as his protege proved he is ready to  emulate that feat.

What Leigh Halfpenny achieved in the course of this routine rout of modest opposition was simply  staggering. By dispatching all 11 shots at goal — most of them from absurdly acute angles — he reduced the art he practises so diligently into a mere formality.

That is also what he did to the question of who will start at full back in the Test series.

On form: Leigh Halfpenny's stellar performance drew comparisons to Neil Jenkins

For all the free-spirit running of 
Stuart Hogg and Rob Kearney, who is recovering from a hamstring injury, 
Halfpenny has apparently elevated himself to a parallel  universe of 
sporting perfection.

The 24-year-old worked his magic in 
the shadow of his mentor, the former master of the art. Jenkins was at 
the heart of the 1997 Lions’ triumph in South Africa and he has passed 
on all his accumulated  wisdom to another Welshman with a deadly right 
foot.

As kicking coach here, he will come on
to the field with a tee, offer some water and a few choice words, then 
stand behind the kicker, as a reassuring presence.

He is one of the men who provided the 
inspiration for Halfpenny, when he would spend countless hours, day 
after day, year after year,  practising in Gorseinon with his 
grandfather. Now the young Cardiff Blues phenomenon is living up to 
those he once looked up to.

‘You watch the likes of Neil Jenkins, Jonny Wilkinson and Dan Carter, and you want to be like them,’ said the Lions No 15.

He is certainly fulfilling that 
target. But there is more to it — a specific desire within him to seize 
this chance after 2009, when he joined the tour late, played one game 
against the Cheetahs, and had to return home injured.

Kicking masterclass: Full back Leigh Halfpenny 

‘Ever since I was on the plane back 
from South Africa, I have been dreaming of this moment, of pulling on a 
Lions jersey again,’ said Halfpenny, in the aftermath of his 
masterclass.

  ... but the Lions scored more points than the Australian cricket team, who were skittled for just 65 by India in a Champions Trophy warm-up.

‘I got the opportunity tonight and it was a pretty special 
feeling. I think that’s up there with the best I’ve kicked, there’s no 
doubt about that. I’ve had some games where I’ve managed a few but 
nowhere near as many as that.

‘To kick all 11 was incredible from a personal point of view.

‘I suppose some days you just find 
that sweet spot early on. I felt it could be one of those days, but I 
came off the pitch not knowing how many I’d kicked because I try and 
stay focused. I’m so pleased with how it went.

‘The pressure is a real privilege. To 
be kicking for Wales was a dream of mine, never mind kicking for the 
Lions. I never thought I would be doing it, and I’m enjoying every 
second of it. I always enjoyed goal-kicking as a kid and I’ve tried to 
work hard at it.

‘I have a picture in my head of how I 
want each kick to go. I always try to hit the middle of the goal and 
there’s a lot of work that goes in with Neil Jenkins and the other 
kickers.

‘I do what works for me and I was pleased with how it went.’

While Halfpenny described himself as a
proud man, the same could be said of Jenkins, who told his compatriot 
on  Monday that he would be the kicker, ahead of Ireland fly-half Johnny
Sexton.

The man who delivered 24 of the points
in this thrashing of the feeble Force was glad to have his mentor on 
hand, adding: ‘I certainly notice he’s there. I can’t think of a better 
guy to have bringing on the tee for me and to have alongside me in games
and in training. I’m lucky to have Jenks around.’

While the goal-kicking was supreme, 
the fact that there were so many conversions to line up stemmed from the
Lions’ ability to tear through the opposition defence at will, 
particularly after half-time.

Jamie Heaslip delivered a  rampaging 
display of ball-carrying class to show he has raised his game again at 
just the right time after a mid-season slump.

And he was matched in the gain-line busting and off-loading stakes by his Leinster and Ireland team-mate, flanker Sean O’Brien.

Both men did enough to challenge the prevailing view that the Test back row will be all-Welsh.

Celebration: Manu Tuilagi and Brian O'Driscoll celebrate after the convincing win

Behind a less-than-dominant scrum, 
Sexton showed the variety of his playmaking repertoire with delayed 
inside passes and cross-kicks proving especially effective. 

The giant frames of George North and 
Manu Tuilagi understandably caught the eye of home coach Michael Foley, 
with the latter playing a key part in a superbly drilled routine  
instigated by Sexton and finished by Brian O’Driscoll, for the  
captain’s second try.

Sexton himself scored the first, while
Tom Croft, Heaslip, Mako Vunipola, Tommy Bowe, Owen  Farrell and Geoff 
Parling all touched down as the Lions cut loose.

So many of these Lions and  others made strong, initial Test cases, but the strongest of all came from Halfpenny.

‘Hopefully, if I’m selected, I can step up to the plate like that against Australia,’ he said.

Barring injury, he will be selected and on this evidence, the Wallabies should be very afraid.
