Bare-breasted members of the feminist group Femen targeted the motorcade of Tunisian Prime Minister Ali Larayedh to protest the jailing of group members in Tunis.

As the Tunisian motorcade left following a visit to European Union headquarters, two women climbed atop a diplomatic car and two others chanted slogans.

Security officials dragged the women off the car, and all four ran away from the scene.

Earlier this month, a Tunisian court 
sentenced three Femen activists who staged a topless protest to four 
months and a day in prison.

They were protesting in support of Amina Tyler, 19, who was arrested days earlier.

She
had sparked outrage in the conservative country by posting topless 
pictures of herself to Facebook wearing the slogan 'My body belongs to 
me' in Arabic across her bare chest.

She
was taken into hiding by her family after conservative preachers issued
death threats against her, including one who called for her to be 
stoned to death.

But she later attempted another protest on May 19 in the religious centre of Kairouan, where she was arrested.

Marguerite
Stern and Pauline Hillier, from France, and Josephine Markmann, from 
Germany, were arrested on 29 May as they protested bare-chested in front
of the Tunis Court building.

The
trio had approached the entrance to the ministry wearing coats which 
they took off, revealing naked torsos scrawled with 'Breasts Feed 
Revolution'.

Wearing just jean shorts, the women chanted in English 'Free Amina' and 'Women's spring is coming' as people in the crowd attempted to cover them.

The women then climbed up on the gates of the Justice Ministry until police pulled them down and hustled them shouting into the building as an angry crowd gathered.

Amnesty International has condemned the convictions for public indecency, undermining public morals, and making noise disturbing peace as 'an unacceptable restriction on freedom of expression'.

in her native Tunisia when she posted topless photos of 
herself wearing the slogan 'My body belongs to me' on her Facebook page in a protest over women's rights

months and one day in jail for charges relating to the protest

Hassiba
Hadj Sahraoui, deputy Middle East and North Africa programme director 
at Amnesty, last week said: 'Imprisoning people for expression is 
inherently disproportionate.

'Even if some may consider the three women's protest offensive or counter-productive, this cannot justify placing them behind bars.

'If the Tunisian authorities are serious about respecting their international human rights obligations, they should release the three women.'
