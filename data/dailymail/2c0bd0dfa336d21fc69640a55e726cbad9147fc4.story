He has a shiny gold Olympic medal sparkling on his mantelpiece.

But the self-styled Ginger Wizard admits he has sacrificed rather a lot to get it - most recently of all, his relationship with his girlfriend of eight years.

Team GB's gold-winning long jumper Greg Rutherford has split up with fashion PR Liz Rose, citing his overnight fame for their sudden drift apart.

Calm before the storm: Greg Rutherford says the stresses of travel and his overnight fame after winning Olympic gold this summer led to his break-up with 'beautiful' Liz Rose

The 26-year-old sportsman from Milton Keynes said the break-up was 'sad and a big change after eight years but it's for the best'.

He had thanked his 'beautiful girlfriend' for her support when he won Britain's 13th Gold medal on 'Super Saturday', 4 August, with a leap of 8.31m. It was Team GB's first long-jump gold in 48 years.

Rutherford told the Mirror that his 
life 'completely changed' after his win, and that the stress of 
traveling and competing led to the couple growing apart, but that he accepts it because 'ultimately I'm enjoying what I'm doing'.

He said: 'It's
 a shame as she has always been so supportive of me, and sacrificed 
everything for me, but we drifted towards being friends more than 
anything else....I feel like it's the right thing for both of us.'

The sporting hero said that before the games his public appearances numbered one a month, whereas now his 'manic' schedule requires him to do five or six every day.

Speaking to the Mail about his relationship with Rose back in September, Rutherford admitted: 'To put up with me you have to be patient. I'm very driven and there are lots of things I can't do. I'm not sure how much longer she'll put up with me.'

'I knew I was in great shape. My team are incredible and I have the most amazing parents and beautiful girlfriend in the world.

'I've got a pretty good life, I cannot lie. Everybody has worked so hard for me. I thought I was going to jump further than that, but I don't care, I'm Olympic champion.

'What a night for British athletics - three gold medals. I can't thank everyone enough.

'This is what I have dreamed of my whole life and to do it in London is just incredible, I might wake up in a minute.'
