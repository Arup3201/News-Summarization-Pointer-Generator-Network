Many of us spend hours - and a small fortune - fretting over acne, but would you ever pay the same attention or shell out as much money on hiding your freckles?

A new trend, which sees women using laser treatments to banish the small pigmentation spots, is sweeping the beauty world.

While the average Brit has around 35 freckles on their body, some people have a lot more and it seems to be wreaking havoc with their self-confidence.

Before and after: A new craze for having freckles removed is sweeping the beauty world. Sally Whittle, pictured left, before, and after, paid £700 to get rid of hers and says she couldn't be happier with the results

While the likes of Gisele Bündchen, Olivia Munn and Rachel Bilson embrace their freckles, for one woman, they were the subject of years of bullying and insecurity.

Speaking about her self-consciousness, Sally Whittle, 21, from Cardiff, Wales, said: 'I would pile on foundation, it always looked thick and cakey.

'I would hate going on holiday where it was too hot to cover up my face, and swimming would make me paranoid as I knew it would wash off. To be honest, I would just look like a walking freckle on holiday! I hated it.'

Sally decided to shell out £700 to banish her freckles once and for all.

She underwent RevLite - a laser treatment that promises to help with skin lightening and treating difficult conditions including acne and acne scarring, fine lines and wrinkles, hyperpigmentation and melasma.

How does it work? The treatment, which costs £175 a pop, uses a pulsed beam of light and optimum power to shatter dark skin particles

The 
procedure uses a pulsed beam of light and optimum power to shatter dark 
skin particles, which are gradually removed by the body’s natural 
processes.

The
 machine’s flat-top beam distributes the energy evenly over the 
problematic skin area or dark pigmentation encouraging it to fade and 
disappear over time.

Doctors say three to four treatments are enough to sort the problem and claim that the procedure has minimal downtime thanks to how quickly the energy is pulsed through the skin, which minimises redness and recovery.

Speaking about the treatment, which costs £175 per session, Dr Maria Gonzalez, who offers it at her Cardiff clinic, said: 'This treatment is a newcomer on the market as most patients have heard of Fraxel or CO2 lasers for pigmentation.

'However, even though I have a CO2 laser I believe the RevLite treatment provides a superior result with less pain and less downtime.

'It is 
also much safer in patients with pigmented skin in whom we do a less 
aggressive treatment known as laser toning providing safe and effective 
rejuvenation and improvement in pigmentation.'

After one treatment, Sally noticed a 
dramatic difference in the appearance of her freckles, and by the second
 the difference was significant, she said.

She added: 'Four treatments later and I no longer 
wear foundation and I am confident within my new freckle-free skin.

'My 
friends have all commented on how flawless my skin is, I still find it 
weird considering I have hated it for so long.'
