Premier League duo Chelsea and Liverpool earned more money from selling players during the summer transfer window than all but two clubs in Europe.

The Blues opted to cash in on a number of stars in order to finance Jose Mourinho's summer spending and keep in line with Financial Fair Play rules.

The west London club made £81million - the third highest amount of any side on the continent - after selling David Luiz to Paris Saint-Germain for £50m, Romelu Lukaku to Everton for £25m up-front and Demba Ba to Besiktas for £6m.

Chelsea sold Brazilian defender David Luiz to Paris Saint-Germain for £50million over the summer

The Blues also allowed Romelu Lukaku to join Everton on a permanent basis for a fee rising to £28million

That leaves them one spot above Liverpool, who sit fourth, on a list put together by research group The Football Observatory. 

The Reds made £80m after Barcelona met Luis Suarez's £75m release clause and they also sold Pepe Reina, Martin Kelly, Daniel Agger and Jack Robinson.

Real Madrid are second after parting with Angel di Maria (£60m), Xabi Alonso (£7m), Alvaro Morata (£16m) and Nuri Sahin (£7m) for a total income of £90m, but they still sit behind another club from England.

Manchester United bought Angel di Maria for a British transfer record fee of £60million from Real Madrid

Southampton really raked it in, selling Adam Lallana for £25m to Liverpool

The sales of Suarez (left) and Luiz were two of the biggest deals last summer

Southampton top the table after making £97million from selling five of their first team stars to other clubs in the top-flight.

Teenage defenders Luke Shaw (£30million) and Calum Chambers (£16m) joined Manchester United and Arsenal respectively, while Adam Lallana (£25m), Rickie Lambert (£4m) and Dejan Lovren (£20m) all swapped the south coast for Liverpool. 

Those deals left newly appointed manager Ronald Koeman with plenty of cash to splash as he brought eight new players to St Mary's before the September 1 deadline. 

Ligue 1 side Monaco complete the top five having made £76m on deals including James Rodriguez's move to Real Madrid and Emmanuel Riviere's switch to Newcastle United.
