The Minnesota news reader who faced allegations of being drunk while on air last week, has claimed she was sick and not under the influence of alcohol.

Annie Stensrud ended up making headlines herself after slurring her words during a live news broadcast on KEYC-TV, CBS/Fox, in Mankato.

But the station’s General Manager said the faux pas was due to a bad reaction to medication, which Stensrud confirmed.

Embarrassing: Annie Stensrud, a reporter on KEYC-TV in Mankato, Minnesota, slurred and mixed up her words during a 10pm broadcast

Slurred: She has been anchoring weekend evening broadcasts for a year and her Sunday show had been cut down because of an over-running NFL game

She said in a statement: ‘My performance last Sunday [December 4 at 10pm] was terrible, and for that I apologise.

‘I’ve been sick for some time and taking medication and have missed a lot of work lately.

‘I’m on my way to feeling better and 
hope to be back at full strength soon. I appreciate everyone’s 
understanding and even more so, their support’, Radaronline.com 
reported.

The stations GM, Dennis Walhstrom, 
told WCCO Radio after the incident that she should have called in sick 
but stands by her statement.

He said: ‘That’s what we found, that she had a reaction to a medication.

'She’s also missed work and had not been feeling well for the past week.

‘She was taking unspecified medication that she had a bad reaction to.

'She probably shouldn’t have come in. She should have called in.’

Anchor: She has been a professional journalist for less than five years but has already interviewed Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi

Annie has been anchoring weekend 
evening broadcasts for a year and her Sunday show had been cut down 
because of an over-running NFL game.

In one of the strangest segments, Ms 
Stensrud says: ‘Today’s event featured Christmas fo… music, food and a 
chance to meet the Santa dog.

‘They
felt three ways for Christmas…parents and grandparents,’ Ms Stensrud 
adds, as she speaks over a man giving a pre-recorded interview.

The Huffington Post suggested Ms Stensrud could have been drunk, whereas Gawker.com added that she might just have a strange accent.

KEYC news director Dan Ruiter told TV Spy that although station may work in a ‘very public business, personnel issues need to remain private’.

He told the Mankato Free Press that there is no proof she was intoxicated and viewers are jumping to conclusions if they believe this.

The incident had echoes of when CBS Los Angeles journalist Serene Branson garbled her words live on air, causing speculation she had a stroke.

Doctors said she was suffering from symptoms of a stroke, but had actually suffered a complex migraine during a live Grammys broadcast.
