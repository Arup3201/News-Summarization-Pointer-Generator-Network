England's hopes of qualifying for the second round of the World Cup hang by a thread after their 2-1 defeat by Uruguay.

Roy Hodgson must pray that Italy beat Costa Rica on Friday to ensure the Three Lions remain in the competition.

And Azzurri striker Mario Balotelli has delivered his demands should he help make that happen - a kiss from the Queen!

Cheeky: Mario Balotelli says he expects a kiss of the Queen if Italy beat Costa Rica on Friday

Not his type... The Queen attends Ladies Day at Royal Ascot on Friday... hours before England's defeat

He tweeted: 'If we beat Costa Rica I want a kiss, obviously on the cheek, from the UK Queen.'Balotelli scored the winner when Italy beat England last week and will lead the line again in Recife.

If
 Cesare Prandelli's men pick up another three points, England must beat 
Costa Rica on Tuesday and hope Italy beat Uruguay on the same night.

Meanwhile, Prandelli expects conditions to favor the Costs Ricans on Friday night.‘As
 far as I'm concerned the South American teams have an advantage not 
just because they live and work and operate under these conditions, but 
their explosiveness is different from that of European teams,’ Prandelli
 said, lumping his Central American opponent in with its counterparts 
farther south.

‘Based on the data that we looked at and the matches we 
analysed, the Europeans withstand more (defensively) - they're more 
resistant - but they are less explosive vis-a-vis their South American 
counterparts.’

Prandelli said the Italians knew well in advance they would have to cope with the heat and humidity. ‘We're
 ready. We don't have any more excuses,’ he said. ‘The climate doesn't 
scare us anymore. The squads scare us - the squads that increase their 
pace during matches.

‘So 
tomorrow, I think we're going to be suffering. I really believe that we 
will suffer, but we have an idea of what we're going to be doing on the 
pitch.’

Forecasts are calling for rain and temperatures approaching 30C again.
