Derby matches are great. They allow players and fans alike to have bragging rights for a period of time. They were the fixtures I looked forward to the most and I loved playing in them. But not in Scotland!

When I was at Bath, the West Country derbies against Bristol and Gloucester were brilliant matches to be a part of. They were ferocious on and off the park especially at Kingsholm where I was made very welcome being captain of Bath and Scottish!

They were the highlight of the season and, on many occasions, produced outstanding matches with both sides throwing everything at the opposition with the objective to score as many points as possible to humiliate your near neighbours.

This changed when I moved back to play for Glasgow. Suddenly, the derby against Edinburgh turned into a turgid affair when both sides seemed paralysed by the fear of losing to their nearest rival. One reason for this was they were seen as National Trials when you faced up to a player who you were battling with for the Scotland team. This meant lots of players went into their shells and made damn sure the opposition team and individual player did nothing to improve their chances of being selected for the national team.

This is what happened on Saturday at Scotstoun. Glasgow and Edinburgh produced a forgettable match in front of an excited and expectant capacity crowd who deserved so much more in terms of intent and quality. The irony of this is that Edinburgh do not have that many Scottish-qualified players but it was still seen as a trial.

Glasgow won the game and will take the four points on offer but that was just about all they will take from this. They stay second in the league and on course for a home play-off but they will need to play a whole lot better if this is to be achieved. Worryingly, one of their most consistent performers this season, Rob Harley, went off with a nasty looking leg injury which will definitely keep him out of the return match at Murrayfield and time will tell how many other games. His work rate has laid the platform that has allowed the Warriors to perform and, although they have strength in depth in this area, the injuries are mounting with Adam Ashe and Chris Fusaro and he will be missed.

Both sides put in plenty of perspiration but lacked any real inspiration. Glasgow scored the only try of the game after great set up play from Sean Lamont and Peter Horne allowed Josh Strauss to score. They should have had a second try when DTH van der Merve was judged to have made a forward pass to Nico Matawalu when it looked perfectly good to me. 

Referee George Clancy did not refer it to the TMO which was surprising as every decision, these days, seems to be referred. I wonder if this was the reason that Clancy did not refer it, he wanted to show that he could make the call on his own. Even so, it was the wrong call.

Edinburgh have improved as the season has developed. If this game had taken part in the first few weeks of the season on hard ground and Glasgow flying and Edinburgh really struggling, Glasgow would have won by 40 points. But Edinburgh have made themselves tough to play against and defended really well in the tackle and competed really well at the breakdown.

They were a much better attacking threat in the second half when Tom Heathcote came on at stand-off which allowed Greig Tonks to move to his best position of full back. He made a number of good runs and showed his class. I hope he remains at full back for the return game on Friday.

The turgid nature of the game and the lack of ambition of either side played right into Edinburgh’s hands. They were very comfortable in the arm wrestle the match became but had no answer when Glasgow played their off-loading game which should have given them two tries.

This means the 1872 Cup is, theoretically, still up for grabs in the return. It should have been over as Glasgow were much better than the 10-point winning margin suggested but Edinburgh will have a real go at Murrayfield. The big pitch will suit the Warriors but my only wish is that we have a much better game than we saw at Scotstoun on Saturday.
