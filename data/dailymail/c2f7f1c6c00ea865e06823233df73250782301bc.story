Chelsea supporters have praised the club after the announcement of new plans that could lead to an expansion of Stamford Bridge.

The West London outfit announced on Tuesday that owner Roman Abramovich had commissioned a study to look at ways in which their 109-year home could be expanded - including a new proposal to build decking over the restrictive train track to the east and north of the ground.

And the Chelsea Supporters' Trust have spoken out to say that they welcome the new development in Chelsea's long-running stadium saga and the attempts to expand Stamford Bridge - an apparent u-turn from the club's previous attempts to move away to the likes of Earls Court and Battersea Power Station.

The statement from the Supporters' Trust also offers Chelsea existing comments and suggestions from local residents recorded by the Trust that could help Chelsea in the initial consultation phase of the study.

Stamford Bridge's capacity currently sits at 41,837 and the Blues have previously explored the possibility of moving to nearby Battersea power station and Earls Court, options which are no longer there.

By potentially utilising decking over the railway lines to the east and north of the ground Chelsea believe they could get around the obstacles associated with expansion on their relatively small West London site.

Chelsea had previously been accused by shareholders in Chelsea Pitch Owners (CPO) - the fan-led company which owns the land beneath Stamford Bridge - of not fully exploring the possibility of staying put before attempting to buy back the stadium freehold in October 2011.

That was seen as a precursor to a move to a new 60,000-seater ground, something Chelsea are unable to do before convincing CPO to sell up - and Abramovich and Chelsea now seem to have made a significant u-turn.

A potential expansion would help Chelsea to boost their matchday revenue. Stamford Bridge is currently the Premier League's eighth largest ground. A 60,000 capacity would improve that ranking to third.

Familiar: Chelsea have spent their entire history at Stamford Bridge and the new plans could see them stay

The Chelsea Supporters Trust welcomes the recent announcement by Chelsea FC regarding commissioning a study of the area from Fulham Broadway town centre to Stamford Bridge and beyond. We particularly welcome the fact that “the study will also assess the feasibility of an expansion of the stadium within the existing historic site boundaries”. We note that the study specifically excludes “any design or details of a redevelopment on the stadium site” which presumably would wait until the study report has been published and decisions made.  As well as engaging stakeholders such as the local community and residents groups, which is clearly essential, we urge the club to actively involve Chelsea supporters in the study (and the implementation of the study results), which is clearly of significant importance to all Chelsea supporters.  We  will pass on to those conducting the study the comments and suggestions we have received from members of the local community following extensive door to door leafleting that we have carried out in the area over the last year, as well as ideas we have been given with regard to Brompton Cemetery. The CST are keen to work with the various parties involved in the study, as the stadium issue is of fundamental interest to our members, as was made clear in the 2013 CST Members Survey.
