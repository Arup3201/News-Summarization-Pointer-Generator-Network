Sandra Fluke, the contraception activist who shot from obscurity to the national spotlight in 2012 when she argued that her Catholic law school should be required to provide birth control to female students for free, said Wednesday that she's decided not to run for Congress in California.

The newly minted 'social justice attorney' was one of three Democrats who had petitioned the California Democratic Party for its endorsement in the 33rd District election set for nine months from now.

Henry Waxman, who has served in Congress since 1975, is vacating that seat at the end of his current term.

Fluke will run instead for a state Senate seat held by Democrat Ted Lieu, who is running for Waxman's seat.

'I am extremely moved by the outpouring of local and national support I have received since I announced that I was considering running for office,' Fluke said in a statement.

'While I strongly considered offering my candidacy for Congress, I feel there is a better way to advance the causes that are important to our community.'

Attorney Sandra Fluke made her name as a feminist advocate for universal access to contraceptives, but she'll need a broader platform is she wants to be a member of Congress

U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman once chaired the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, but announced his retirement in an era where Democrats have little chance of returning to the majority any time soon

The single-issue activist famously threw a monkey wrench into the 2012 political campaign season with claims that Republicans were engaged in a 'war on women.'

House Republicans refused last year to add her name to a witness list in a February hearing about exceptions to the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate for religiously affiliated organizations.

When Democrats convened their own meeting a week later to hear her speak, Fluke argued that Georgetown University, a Roman Catholic institution, should be required to include birth control services in health insurance plan for students, despite church teachings opposing contraception.

She argued at the time that 40 per cent of female Georgetown law students endured financial hardship because they were forced to pay for birth control themselves, at a cost of $3,000 per year.

Within a day news reports confirmed that commercial pharmacies within a few miles of the university offered generic birth control pills for $9 per month.

If she follows through on her candidacy for state Senate, Fluke will have to come up with a $953 filing fee to establish her candidacy. California allows candidates to submit 3,000 petition signatures instead of paying the fee, but the deadline looms on February 20.

Conservative talk radio icon Rush Limbaugh made his own national headlines two years ago by commenting that Fluke was asking taxpayers to compensate her for the financial costs of her sexual activity, making her equivalent to a prostitute.

Fluke 'essentially says that she must be paid to have sex – what does that make her?' Limbaugh asked on his radio show. 'It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She wants to be paid to have sex.'

No dittos: Rush Limbaugh got into hot water for calling Fluke a 'slut' after she demanded financial compensation to cover the cost of birth control pills at Georgetown University law school. He later apologized under pressure from fleeing advertisers, but Fluke wouldn't accept his words

Sandra Fluke thrust herself into the national spotlight as a single-issue feminist activist, but will have to grapple with a wder range of issues as she fights a widening slate of Democratic rivals

He later apologized publicly for the comments after some sponsors threatened to pull their ads from his broadcasts.

'I sincerely apologize to Ms. Fluke for the insulting word choices,' he wrote.  But Fluke refused to accept the apology.

'I don't think that a statement like this issued, saying that his choice of words was not the best, changes anything,' she said during an appearance on ABC's 'The View' program, 'and especially when that statement is issued when he's under significant pressure from his sponsors.'

The resulting national furor, and Fluke's expertly played victim role, catapulted her to Democratic stardom and an invitation to speak at the party's 2012 national convention.

In addition to Fluke, two other Democrats have thrown their hats into the ring for Waxman's House seat.

Golden boy? California Democratic state Sen. Ted Lieu is serious about succeeding Henry Waxman, and the 40-something Taiwanese immigrant's steady rise through the ranks has brought him a strong political apparatus just in time for a closely watched campaign

Ted Lieu, a Taiwanese-American state senator since 2011 and a member of the state assembly for six years before that, is a left-leaning political hybrid who spans the chasm between social liberals and pro-business Democrats.

The Air Force Reserve lieutenant colonel authored legislation, the first of its kind, that bans mental health professionals from trying to 'convert' gay teens into heterosexuals through specialized therapy. He also sponsored a landmark bill allowing schools to discipline cyber-bullying students.

Lieu also received the California Small Business Association's highest rating last month, in part because of his opposition to state taxes that hit small businesses retroactively.

His current state legislative district encompasses 86 per cent of the congressional district. 'All politics is local,' he told MailOnline, echoing the late House speaker Tip O'Neill.

Raised Roman Catholic and educated in Catholic schools in Cleveland, Ohio, Lieu hasn't staked out a position on Obamacare's narrow exceptions for religious objectors.

A Lieu adviser in Sacramento told MailOnline that 'he's absolutely serious' about running, even with the controversial Fluke grabbing may of the headlines. 'My read is, he's in it for the long haul, and he's not going anywhere,' said the adviser, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak about political campaigns.

Lieu told the Santa Monica Lookout, a local newspaper, that running 'was a very difficult decision made quickly; withing 24 hours of Waxman's retirement announcement.

'I cannot compare myself to Congressmember Waxman,' he reflected. 'He is a living legend.'

The third entrant in the race who has officially applied for the state Democratic Party's endorsement is Wendy Greuel, the City of Los Angeles' former financial controller and the loser in a tight 2013 mayoral election.

Fluke introduced President Barack Obama during a re-election campaign rally in Denver on August 8, 2012. She has managed to parlay her brief window of activist fame into what could be a lasting political career

Lightweight? Marianne Williamson, author of books on miracles, prayer, and a spiritual approach to weight loss, was already in the hunt to replace Waxman before he announced his retirement from Congress

A moderate who already has the backing of Senator Barbara Boxer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Greuel launched her campaign this week for the 33rd District seat with a flurry of endorsements, announcing one on the 33rd minute of each hour Monday on her social media accounts.

She emailed 40,000 supporters at 9:33 Monday morning to to announce her intention to succeed Waxman.

'Now that he's decided to retire, I'm rolling up my sleeves to carry on his amazing legacy,' Greuel wrote.

The Twitter hashtag #ReadyForWendy is crisscrossing California's political circles, bringing with it comparisons to the 'Ready For Hillary' super PAC gather support for a Hillary Clinton presidential run.

But unlike the former secretary of state, Greuel is seen as politically moderate when compared with the departing Waxman.

That could serve her well in a district that has trended less and less liberal since the last congressional redistricting in 2010.

Waxman, who enjoyed landslide re-election margins throughout most of his career, won his last race by just 8 points over Bill Bloomfield, a moderate businessman and political independent who co-founded the category-confounding 'NoLabels' political movement.

Bloomfield is expected to enter the race to replace Waxman this year.

So is Marianne Williamson, a far-left new-age guru and best-selling author popular with Californians of the generation that can correctly spell 'Haight-Ashbury.'

'The trajectory of corporatism is already wreaking havoc on our environment, our civil liberties, our economy and even our food supply,' Williamson complains on her campaign website.

Would-be Los Angeles mayor Wendy Greuel is definitely running for Congress, hoping to avoid another second-place finish this time around

'When banks, oil companies, chemical companies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, food companies, military manufacturers and prison builders are able to influence our lawmakers so disproportionately to the influence wielded by average citizens, we have a problem.'

She has no illusions about the possibility that the time for unreconstructed radicals may have come and gone, even in California.

'I'm sure they’re going to say I’m a new age nutcase, dragon lady, lightweight thinker,' she told The New York Times at a recent book-signing that doubled as a mini-campaign rally.

In a district that now includes more Republicans than ever, one autograph-seeker shrugged in agreement that universal health care, universal preschool and a universal ban on nuclear energy – all things Waxman has championed – won't play the way they used to.

'You need new voters, I think,' the man said.
