A judge has granted a protection order against Nebraska Lieutenant Governor Lavon Heidemann after his sister accused him of violent behavior.

The order, which was issued Monday against Lt. Gov. Heidemann, a farmer from Elk Creek, Nebraska, comes as he looks to return to office as the running mate of Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete Ricketts.

His sister, Lois Bohling, of Tecumseh, Nebraska, claims that her brother came after her like a 'wild man,' charging at her and grabbing her wrists after a disagreement over some property left by their late father and the care of their mother.

Lt. Gov. Heidemann refuted these claims, saying in a statement, 'This is a private, legal family matter regarding disagreements resulting from my dad’s estate, as well as the best possible medical treatment for my mom. I dispute much of my sister’s claims.' 

He then added, 'My immediate family has great support from the rest of our family, our church and our friends – we appreciate that support so very much in this difficult time, as we work toward a full resolution.' 

Miss Bohling filed a sworn statement last month in which she detailed some of her brothers behavior, going back to December of 2013. 

She wanted to block Lt. Gov. Heidemann from contacting her or from visiting their disabled mother, Lola Heidemann, who was widowed after their father died in January of 2013.

Of that December encounter, she said that during a family discussion her brother 'was shouting at me and at one point raised up, and started to come over the table at me with a furor in his eyes, like a wild man, that scared me to pieces.'

This is the same look she said she saw the last time they were together, at their mother's home, with the Lt. Gov. allegedly upset over how Miss Bohling was caring for the elderly woman.

'He had charged at me and instinctively, without realizing it, my hands were in front of my head trying to protect his charging at me. That same look of hatred that I saw last December was in his eyes,' she said in her statement. 

'He grabbed my arms still in front of my face. He was screaming at me with his face no more than six inches from my face. He was forcefully holding on to both of my arms at the wrist area and screamed, "YOU ARE TO STAY AWAY FROM HERE." I heard mom while crying, saying, (several times) "No, Lavon, don't."' 

A spokesperson for Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman issued a statement that said, 'The Governor is aware of the situation, and he is currently gathering and reviewing the facts. He is not going to rush to judgment on the Lt. Governor’s family situation. He recognizes this is a difficult and trying matter for the Lt. Governor and his family.'

Heidemann was appointed lieutenant governor in February of 2013.
