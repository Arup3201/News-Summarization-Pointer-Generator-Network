Doomsday fanatics claim that a 12th century prophecy states  the successor to Benedict XVI will be the last pope before the end of the world.

After the Mayan 2012 prophecies failed to materialise, apocalypse aficionados have turned their attention to the purported writings of St Malachy, an Irish saint and Archbishop of Armagh, who lived between 1094 and 1148.

St Malachy is said to have travelled to Rome in 1139, where he experienced a vision of future popes, writing down a series of 112 cryptic phrases that described each one in turn. 

Prophecies: St. Malachy, an Irish saint who lived between 1094 and 1148 
is said to have travelled to Rome in 1139, where he 
experienced a vision of future popes

The saint's final prediction 'Petrus Romanus' is now being linked to leading contender Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Turkson.

According to Malachy's visions, 'Petrus Romanus' will be the 112th and final pope after whom it is stated that the 'the seven-hilled city will be destroyed and the dreadful Judge will judge the people'.

Although not part of official Catholic teaching, the Prophecy of the Popes is well known by Vatican officials and Catholic scholars.

Naysayers have found ways to successfully link each of the phrases to a corresponding pope throughout the centuries.

Pope John Paul II, for instance is associated with phrase No. 110, 'From the labour of the sun,' because he was both born and entombed on the day of a solar eclipse.

And current pope Benedict XVI, is 
linked to phrase No 111, 'glory of the olive' due to the fact that some
 members of the monastic order founded by St. Benedict are known as 
Olivetans.

The ominous phrase No 112, reads: 'In the final persecution of the Holy Roman Church 
there will reign Petrus Romanus (Peter the Roman), who will feed his 
flock amid many tribulations; after which the seven-hilled city will be 
destroyed and the dreadful Judge will judge the people.'

Current Pope Benedict XVI, is linked to phrase No. 
111, 'glory of the olive' due to the fact that some members of the 
monastic order founded by St. Benedict are known as Olivetans, while the final prediction 'Petrus Romanus' is being linked to leading contender for his successor Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Turkson

And with Cardinal Turkson being a member of the Roman Curia or Court of Rome, it is enough to have doomsday prophets heading back to their bunkers.

However many experts believe the so-called 'Prophecy of Popes' is a fake and was made up in an attempt to increase a 16th-century cardinal's chances of becoming pope.

One of the biggest holes is the fact they only came to light in 1595, in a book by Benedictine monk Arnold de Wyon. The original text was said to have lain unnoticed in Rome's archives until Wyon published it.

Sister Madeleine Grace, a historical theologian at the University of St. Thomas who specializes in medieval texts, told NBC News: 'There are just a number of red flags,'

'The material that implies they're talking about future popes is rather scanty indeed, and there are factual errors. ... The likelihood is that they're some kind of forgery.'

While it is an accepted fact that our planet will one day be consumed by the Sun, modern science has calculated that that will not happened for several billion years.

But that hasn't stopped mankind repeatedly predicting that the world is about to end. In fact, doomsday prophecies have been made ever since we started using calendars, with flood, famine, incoming asteroids and nuclear wars among the favoured causes of annihilation.

Biblical scholars point out that in the Book of Matthew, Jesus himself implies that the world will end within the lifetime of his contemporaries, while a host of scholars made similar predictions in the first millennium.

The craze appears to have reached a peak in Europe in the Middle Ages. In 1500, Protestant reformer Martin Luther proclaimed that 'the kingdom of abominations shall be overthrown' within 300 years.

Others to get in on the act included 
Christopher Columbus (1656), mathematician John Napier (1688) and 
astrologer Sir Isaac Newton (1948).

More recently, the fad for making Doomsday predictions has become popular amongst Christian groups in the U.S. According to website Armageddononline, prophecy teacher Doug Clark announced in 1976 that President Jimmy Carter would be 'the president who will meet Mr. 666 - soon', 

And about 50 members of a group called the Assembly of Yahweh gathered at Coney Island, New York, in white robes, awaiting their 'rapture' from a world about to be destroyed on May 25, 1981.

'A small crowd of onlookers watched and waited for something to happen. The members chanted prayers to the beat of bongo drums until sunset. The end did not come,' the website notes.

The year 2000 was also expected to usher in an apocalypse of sorts, with aeroplanes falling from the sky and computer systems crashing. The planet survived. 

In the days leading up to September 9, 2009, fans of Armageddon insisted that the world would end - 9/9/9 being the emergency services phone number in the UK and also the number of the Devil - albeit upside down. Surprisingly there wasn't the same hyperbole on June 6, 2006.

But if the world does manage to get through today unscathed, believers won't have to wait too long before another popular Doomsday prediction date looms.

The Maya civilisation of South America was for several centuries one of the most advanced in the world. Along with their architectural achievements, the Mayans left us with calendars that, some argue, predicted the end of the world on December 21, 2012.

According to internet rumours circulating at the time, a mountain near the French town of Bugarach would burst open just in time for a spaceship to emerge to carry people to
 safety.
