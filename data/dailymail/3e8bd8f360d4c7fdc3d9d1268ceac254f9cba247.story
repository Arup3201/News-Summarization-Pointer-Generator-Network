A mysterious man known only as Jonnie has apologised to a woman and told her he loves her – by hiring a plane to soar through the sky with a banner saying: 'I'm sorry, I love you'.

Jonnie, believed to be in his thirties, paid more than £650 to hire the plane to fly over Basingstoke, Hampshire, to apologise to the woman, called Leah.

His message read: 'Leah I'm sorry I love you Jonnie X.'

The man, known only as Jonnie, paid more than £650 to hire the plane to fly the banner above Basingstoke, Hampshire, to apologise to a woman called Leah. The flying banner said: 'Leah I'm sorry I love you Jonnie'

He paid plane banner company Airads to fly over the town centre with the giant message on the back.

Airads offers plane banners and skywriting, but usually takes orders from those looking to propose in style or celebrate a special occasion.

Simon Moores, director of Airads, said the apology was only the second he had flown in 10 years.

He said: 'Normally, I don't like doing apologies because they often cancel at the last minute.

'This is only one of two in the last 10 years that actually went through with it.

'He was more mature than most, rather than the normal schoolkids or teenagers who look us up. 

'He was more determined than others which convinced me and he had his credit card ready on the spot.' 

The plane flew from Brimpton Airfield and circled Wade Road in Basingstoke several times displaying the message.

Leah took to Facebook anonymously to say she had seen the apology but that it was no one else's business

Afterwards, people took to Facebook speculating as to what the apology was all about.

And the recipient, Leah, posted anonymously on the 'Spotted Basingstoke Town Centre' Facebook page.

She wrote: 'Hi I'm Leah, the plane lady everyone is talking about!!!

'Yes I did see the plane. The apology is for something which is non (sic) of anybody's business but my own. Thank you for all the comments and suggestions.'

It is understood Jonnie arranged to meet Leah while the banner flew over her workplace. Afterwards, Jonnie messaged Mr Moores to thank him for successfully delivering the message. 

Mr Moores said: 'He sent me a text saying he wanted to say a massive thank you.

'We don’t do many apologies because it’s such an emotionally fraught situation that  people call up and  desperately want one done but then back out at the last possible moment.

'He was different though, he was determined and I wanted to help'.
