'Devious conman': Paul Gaffney, 51, scammed 18 elderly victims - including his own next door neighbour - out of £105,000

A rogue trader who conned elderly residents out of more than £105,000 has been jailed for nine years.

Paul Gaffney, 51, approached vulnerable residents on their doorsteps, offering his services as a home repairman and contractor.

But Gaffney, who the judge described as a 'devious conman', would leave jobs half-finished or poorly done and then accompany his elderly victims to the bank to make sure that he was paid.

A year-long investigation found that the father-of-three from Cosham, Hampshire, scammed a total of 18 residents - including his own elderly next door neighbour - during his crime spree, which started in March 2012.

Some of Gaffney's victims applauded as he was sentenced to nine years in jail at Portsmouth Crown Court yesterday.

Judge Sarah Munro QC said that Gaffney used his 'charm' and 'good character' to trick a 'very significant number of vulnerable and elderly, some very elderly, people'.

One victim, retired architect Peter Bolt, 85, handed over £35,000 for work which was never carried out at his home in Southsea, Hampshire.

The court heard that in April 2014, while already on bail bail for 18 charges of fraud, Gaffney drove Mr Bolt to his bank to withdraw money to pay for a job that Gaffney had promised to do.

But quick-thinking bank staff called the police and officers were waiting for Gaffney when he turned up at Mr Bolt’s home the next day.

Mr Bolt said: 'I was shocked when the police came round to see me. None of the work had been done but I had faith in him that he would do it.

'But, when I added it all up, I realised I had given him a huge amount of money.

'When you hear he had conned so many people in such an awful way, and deprived people of their life savings and probably caused them nervous breakdowns, I’m very relieved he’s got such a large sentence.Hopefully he will never ever do such things again.'

Gaffney would offer to fix electrics, boilers, windows and roofs despite having only painting and decorating qualifications - and even returned to some of his victims more than once.

An 80-year-old widower from Cosham was also conned out of £24,000 for work to his roof. The great-grandfather blames himself for recommending Gaffney to a female friend in Southsea who handed over £1,500 for work that was never done.

He said: 'I was in the forces and I have seen terrible things but nothing has affected me this badly.

'Really, I am responsible for what happened to my friend too. I can’t sleep more than four hours a night.'

His friend, an 81-year-old widow, said Gaffney haunts her dreams to this day.

'I have nightmares where he is in my house, I run for help, come back and he has cleared everything out. It took a lot of time and money to get my visa to visit my granddaughter in America and he took that too.

'Now I don’t have the confidence to go over there. The thing is, he was so plausible. At Christmas he gave us a huge piece of Christmas cake because he said we were good customers.'

The court heard the crime spree began in March 2012 when Gaffney approached next door neighbour Terry Roberts.

Gaffney said he was having some work done on his roof and if they both had it done together it would work out cheaper.

Mr Roberts, who is elderly and suffers ill-health, agreed and handed over more than £3,000. He had scaffolding at the front of his house for more than a year.

Meanwhile, Gaffney had taken a large chunk out of the roof, exposing it to the elements. Mr Roberts and his wife had to spend their life savings putting it right.

In his defence, barrister Paul Barton said Gaffney, a married father-of-three, had an addiction to betting machines.

'A case such as this instils in the public feelings of horror, disgust and fear - and rightly so' - Judge Sarah Munro QC

Earlier this month he made a full admission of his guilt but Judge Sarah Munro QC was scathing in her sentencing.

She said: 'A case such as this instils in the public feelings of horror, disgust and fear - and rightly so.

'Your only qualification is as a painter and decorator. However you are a plausible and devious conman and used your charm and your good character to trick a very significant number of vulnerable and elderly, some very elderly, people.

'Many of them are retired professionals and many of them expressed their surprise they were duped by you despite their own intelligence and backgrounds.'

She said Gaffney’s neighbour, Mr Roberts, had suffered a ‘year of hell’ and added: 'Some of your victims were in their 90s with ill health and disabled.

'You deprived them of their hard-earned sums of money.'

Gaffney pleaded guilty to a total of 20 fraud related charges.
