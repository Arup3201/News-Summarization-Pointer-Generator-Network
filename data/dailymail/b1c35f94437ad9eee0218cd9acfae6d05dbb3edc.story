Tragic: Private Andrew Murgatroyd died after downing 16 shots of 'Top Shelf' alcohol in just 30 minutes, an inquest heard today

A soldier died after downing 16 shots of 'Top Shelf' alcohol in just 30 minutes - causing him to choke on his own vomit.

Private Andrew Murgatroyd, 21, was plied with a lethal cocktail of shots at his barracks leaving party in Hullavington, Wiltshire, an inquest heard today.

He 'necked' 16 measures of the mixed spirits - which had been decanted from all of the optics in the camp's bar - before passing out.

The married soldier, who had been celebrating his transfer to a new posting, then started to choke on his own vomit.

Despite his friends' frantic efforts to save his life, he was pronounced dead at his army quarters at Buckley Barracks.

Now, a coroner is planning to raise the army's 'drinking culture' with Defence Secretary Philip Hammond.

Pvt Murgatroyd, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, had downed two trays of so-called 'Top Shelf' shots during his send-off, the inquest in Salisbury heard.

The lethal cocktail - which had been banned by army chiefs - contained shots from all of the eight optics in the camp's bar.

They had been decanted into a tumbler and 'necked' by the soldier - who was not a regular drinker - in just half an hour, according to witnesses.

The shots included measures of vodka, whisky, Morgan Spiced rum, Southern 
Comfort, Lamb’s Navy Rum, Barcardi, Archers and Malibu.

Pvt Murgatroyd, who was being reposted to Aldershot Barracks in Hampshire, was also forced to stand on a chair and down two cans of lager during the party on February 14 this year.

He passed out on a sofa and was carried to a car by his friends, which took him to his home on the barracks - just a two-minute drive away.

However, as he was being carried upstairs by a friend, his wife Shawni Murgatroyd, 21, noticed his face had turned blue and he had stopped breathing.

His friends performed CPR, but Pvt Murgatoyd was declared dead by paramedics who arrived at his home in an air ambulance half an hour later.

A pathologist found he had died from choking on his own vomit while acutely intoxicated, with more than 320mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in his system - almost four times the drink-drive limit.

Major Timothy Parkes, of the Royal Logistic Corps, told the inquest that 'Top Shelves' have been 'frowned upon' in the army for the last 25 years.

'I can only say sorry to the family for what has gone wrong,' he said. 'I wish I could turn the clock back. It is such a waste.'

The inquest heard the barracks bar was run by a contracted firm called Elior, which had not been told that 'Top Shelf' drinks were banned under Army regulations.

Today, Mrs Murgatroyd recalled the moment she realised her husband was choking.

'When they were carrying upstairs, I noticed he had gone blue,' she said.

'It was a matter of minutes. I said to Gary "he’s gone blue" and there was vomit coming down out of his mouth.'

Speaking after the inquest, she added: 'Andrew was such a lovely guy and I loved him so much. We had so many plans together and now it is all gone.

'I’m just taking it each day as it comes and I’ve got brilliant support around me.'

Swindon and Wiltshire coroner Ian Singleton recorded a narrative verdict and singled out the army's 'drinking culture' for criticism.

'This was a tragic and unnecessary death at a time when Andrew was looking forward to a new posting,' he said.

'There was a lack of appreciation of what the combined effects of such an amount of alcohol would be on Andrew, who was not a regular, heavy drinker.'

He added: 'I am concerned that a culture appears to exist to ply someone with alcohol and I am concerned that culture is not isolated to Buckley Barracks.

'I intend to write to the Defence Secretary to outline my concerns.'
