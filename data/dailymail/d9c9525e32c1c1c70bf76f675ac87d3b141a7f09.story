A 66-year-old Florida man used a bottle of window cleaner to fearlessly disarm a home invader armed with both a gun and a crowbar.

Jacques Baillargeon, a 28-year veteran of the Royal Canadian Mountain Police, said when the armed man appeared in his Southern Florida home on Tuesday morning he grabbed the first thing he could find while resolving, 'no way this guy is going to touch my wife.’

'I said, "…I will try not to panic and I will try to knock him down,"' Mr Baillargeon recounted from his Lauderdale Lakes condominium to WSVN.

Invasion: Jacques Baillargeon, left, a 66-year-old veteran of the Royal Canadian Mountain Police, said that when Nathanel Smith, 29, right, appeared armed in his home he immediately grabbed an item to attack

That first thing was a bottle of blue cleaning liquid, a product Mr Baillargeon hastily sprayed into the man's eyes.

Often containing ammonia, alcohol and sometimes vinegar, the product can cause a burning sensation when touching the eyes.

Reacting the intruder swung his crowbar at Mr Baillargeon who was able to avoid the blow and instead swipe the weapon out of his hand.

The intruder never fired his weapon but instead quickly fled the scene, leaving behind the crowbar as well as a skull cap.

Weapon: Grabbing a bottle of blue window cleaner Mr Baillargeon said he sprayed the chemical, pictured, in the burglar's eyes and blocked his swing of a crowbar

Mr Baillargeon promptly called 911 who reacted in disbelief of his story.

'You sprayed him with window cleaner?' a dispatcher asked.

In a shocking twist, only moments later the Broward police department were on the line with another call reporting a home robbery in the same area.

At that alleged incident a crowbar and a skull cap were said to have been taken.

Police say that caller, Nathanel Smith, 29, falsely reported the items later found in Mr Baillargeon's home in hope of explaining why his fingerprints and potential DNA were on them.

'Did you see anybody, can you tell me what they looked like?' police dispatch asked him.

Serial robber: Police say Smith, seen in court, has admitted to the robbery as well as a second to a 61-year-old couple only two days earlier

'No ma'am, He had on a black, he had on all black with a bandana over his mouth,' Smith said.

Smith was detained by detectives after pulling a bag of marijuana out in front of them from his pants' pocket.

Police say he later confessed to trying to rob Mr Baillargeon as well as another couple a few days earlier.

Noon on Sunday a 61-year-old couple were similarly robbed inside their home after, like Mr Baillargeon, they left their door open to enjoy the cool air from outside.

'A black male armed with a handgun and crowbar entered their apartment and ordered the couple to lie face-down on the bed,' the Broward sheriff's department said in a press release.

'The gunman rummaged through the apartment stealing jewelry, cash, cell phones and a laptop computer. The couple was not injured and the suspect fled,' they wrote.
