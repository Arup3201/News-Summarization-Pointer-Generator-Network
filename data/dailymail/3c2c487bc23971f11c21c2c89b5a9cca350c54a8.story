The headmaster of Eton College is calling for GCSEs to be abolished and pupils spared ‘Victorian-style’ public examinations until they are 18.

Tony Little said he wanted a ‘loosening’ up of what is expected of children at 16 to give schools more freedom over what they teach.

His comments come as around 600,000 pupils across the country await their GCSE results tomorrow.

Headmaster of Eton College Tony Little is heavily critical of the constraints of traditional examining and believes that the system needs to modernise to equip students for the real world

Mr Little said: ‘It seems to me we’re moving to a period when, as a society, we seem to see merit in all, or at least the majority of students, continuing to the age of 18.

'It rather begs the question why we’re having a major public examination at the age of 16 in the way we do it.

‘I say that because I think there are constraints about a traditional, one might almost say Victorian, form of examining – sitting on your own at a desk for a given period of time.

‘As soon as you go into the world of work, the last thing on the whole you do is sit down on your own without speaking. You’re dealing in teams, you’re dealing in groups, you’re sharing things.

‘What I’d like to see is a more inventive approach, a loosening of what we expect at the age of 16 so one could introduce qualifications based on the shared experience of young people. Personally I’d be very happy with a system with a robust examination at the age of 18 and more freedom for schools about how they get there.’

Candidates could face losing up to 5 per cent of the grades for sloppily written papers

Mr Little highlighted the British Science Association CREST awards, which are awarded at three levels of bronze, silver and gold.

He said pupils can gain gold awards by working collaboratively in teams of four and learning that ‘you’re as good as your weakest member’. He added: ‘It’s a tremendous learning experience about collaboratively producing an answer to the problem.’

Pupils at Eton sit mainly IGCSEs – based
on the old O-level and regarded as a tougher alternative to GCSEs – and
about half the subjects in the sixth form are Cambridge Pre-U, which is
seen as a return to traditional A-level study before it was divided 
into ‘bite-sized’ modules.

The school has introduced ‘flipped’ lessons in some subjects, including French, which involves pupils going off researching their own work before class.

Mr Little said: ‘The notion of a school is that you turn up to the lesson, the teacher explains a lot of things in your 40 minutes and you go away and do homework to show you’ve understood.

‘A flipped lesson turns it the other way round. The information you would need to have is available online, you’re set all this in advance and what the lesson then becomes is seeing if you have understood the information and can develop it or manipulate it in creative ways.

‘It’s not a question of every lesson suddenly becoming a flipped lesson. But what’s really good for students is seeing there’s different ways of going about things. That I find rather exciting.

‘We’re developing a whole range of different ways of students learning – a lot of which enables them to take greater control for themselves, more independent learning.’
