When England crashed out of the last global limited-overs tournament there was just the small matter of a dead rubber against the Netherlands to complete what had been a hugely disappointing World Twenty20.

Fast forward 10 months and here we are again amid more recriminations over another lost campaign and a final match, this time against Afghanistan, where England have far more to lose than just a meaningless group match.

Ashley Giles will not need reminding that a dispirited England lost to Holland in Bangladesh and any hope he had of becoming head coach disappeared along with their chances of making an impact on yet another world stage.

The World Cup flops form a huddle on the Sydney Cricket Ground as they prepare to face Afghanistan 

Indications are Peter Moores will keep his job, at least for the Test series in the Caribbean, whatever happens at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday morning but the last thing he needs is another humiliating loss against another of the ‘minnows.’

The fact England turned up early on Wednesday for what used to be known as naughty boy nets and had a full training session said everything about their desperate need to take something, anything, from their worst ever World Cup.

England are the laughing stock of world cricket again and there is no body of people who enjoy that scenario more than an Australian nation who cannot believe their luck that the old enemy have gone out of their World Cup so soon.

Victory against an Afghanistan side who have made a remarkable journey from the refugee camps of Pakistan to be here would barely regain any pride for an England team who are still coming to terms with what they have done.

But for Moores it would perhaps keep the wolves away from his door for just a short while before he helps put the finishing touches to a squad for the three-Test series in the West Indies next month that will be named on Tuesday.

England will be without Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, two players who can still expect a one-day future, when they face Afghanistan and it is far from certain that both will be able to take their places on the plane to St Kitts on April 2.

Moeen strained an abdominal muscle when bowling in the fateful defeat by Bangladesh in Adelaide while Woakes has a ‘stress reaction’ in his third metatarsal of his left foot. Both will be assessed when England get home.

In their absence it is to be hoped England give games to the two players yet to appear in this World Cup in James Tredwell and Ravi Bopara, not least before both could then be making their final one-day international appearances.

If England are serious about ever making an impact in one-day cricket they have to start from scratch after this tournament with a squad full of players who will be at or near their peak in 2019.

That means there is little point in them persevering in 50-over cricket beyond Friday with the likes of Tredwell, Bopara and the senior trio of Ian Bell, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson, who yesterday insisted he wants to play on.

A dead rubber against Afghanistan is hardly the way all of them would have wanted to bow out but at least they will be meeting a team with an identical World Cup record as themselves – just a single victory against Scotland.

There was a familiar figure at the helm of the Afghan team at the SCG yesterday in the avuncular form of coach Andy Moles, the former Warwickshire batsman who has ignored security advice to work in Kabul.

History repeating? England will be eager to avoid a repeat to their loss to Netherlands (pictured) in their World T20 group dead rubber when the same scenario is presented to them on Friday against Afghanistan

Moles has been in charge of a team who have defeated England before – when he coached New Zealand in the Champions Trophy – and would have no qualms about piling on the misery for his homeland.

‘England are not in the best of nick and we still believe we’ve got a scare in us in this World Cup, especially if we show composure at the top of the order,’ said Moles. ‘If we hold our nerve and are at our best we can pull off a shock.

‘I’m obviously sad to see England’s demise but I’m delighted to be here with Afghanistan. We’ve had some great learning experiences, had our first win and gave Sri Lanka a scare. This has been a shop window for Afghan cricket and I think we’ve made friends. We play with a freedom that I’ve tried to enhance.’

It is the ability to play with freedom that has been so badly lacking in England’s cricket but they have one more chance to get it right before they slink off on an early flight home. Otherwise they will lose as many friends as the Afghans have gained.
