Unpleasant video footage of reinstated Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson has emerged in which he appears to advise young men to marry underage girls because they are easier to control.

In the 2009 Sportsmen's Ministry talk, Robertson, 67, who began dating his wife when she was 14-years-old, advises his audience, 'You got to marry these girls when they are 15 or 16. They'll pick your ducks' - which is a literal reference to removing dead bird's feathers.

Warming to his stereotypical redneck theme, Robertson, who was suspended from the A&E hit for nine days earlier this month for homophobic comments, tells the gathered crowd that in addition to being young, the girls have to know how to cook and carry a Bible - 'That'll save you a lot of trouble down the road.'

Controversial again: Video has emerged in which Phil Robertson is seen to advise young men to marry girls as young as 15 to make sure they are supportive wives

While the speech given in Georgia is recounted in a somewhat tongue-in-cheek manner, in light of Robertson's strong views on traditional family values - protected by the First Amendment - they seem slightly inappropriate.

His advice for a happy marriage, which he claims is a kind of 'river rat counseling', is that all men 'Make sure that she can cook a meal. You need to eat some meals that she cooks, check that out.'

Strongly wagging his Bible during his talk, Robertson, declares that each man marrying his young bride needs to make sure she is a God-fearing woman.

'Make sure she carries her Bible,' preaches the duck call patriarch as he repeats his claim that a lady who plucks ducks - an unsavory task - is a real woman.

Strong marriage: Miss Kay and Phil Robertson have been married for 47-years and began dating when she was 14 and he was 18 - they married when he was 20

Phil Robertson, the patriarch of the "Duck Dynasty" TV series, center, leaves the White's Ferry Road Church of Christ in West Monroe, La. on Sunday, Dec. 22, 2013. Robertson was suspended in early December for homophobic comments

To a few uncomfortable laughs, Robertson tries to bring some humor to proceedings by telling the boys they need to check with the girls parents obviously before they marry the 15 or 16-year-old girls.

While the age of consent in Robertson's home state of Louisiana is 17, it is legal for marriage to take place with parental consent at the age of 16.

However, in his address, the Duck Dynasty star says that guys should catch girls early because waiting makes it harder to find the right one to take care of your ducks.

'Look, you wait until they get to be 20-years-old, the only picking that’s going to take place is your pocket,' said Robertson.

'You got to marry these girls when they are about 15 or 16, they’ll pick your ducks. You need to check with mom and dad about that of course.'

Robertson, 67, began dating his wife of 47-years, Miss Kay, when she was 14-years-old and he married her in 1966 when he was 20 and she was 16-years-old.

This new video has emerged in the wake of A&E lifting his suspension from the cable network's No.1 rated show for his anti-gay and racially provocative comments that Roberston made in an interview with GQ magazine.

In the article, Robertson quoted passages from the Bible - calling homosexuality a sin and comparing it to bestiality.

His suspension appalled his supporters on the right such as Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin.

Their vocal campaign to make Robertson a victim of political-correctness which had violated his First Amendment rights was successful and he was reinstated.

Indeed, over the weekend the Robertson family issued a statement to Fox News saying they are 'excited to keep making a quality TV show for our dedicated fans, who have showed us wonderful support. We will continue to represent our faith and values in a positive way through Duck Dynasty and our many projects that we are currently working on.'

'The outpouring of support and prayers has encouraged and emboldened us greatly,' the family added.

The network said in a statement yesterday that they planned to reinstate Phil on the reality show after discussions with the Robertson family and consultations with 'numerous advocacy groups'.

But despite this, many spoke out against Phil's reinstatement - the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Discrimination (GLAAD) issuing a statement yesterday to Fox News saying it the network is just greedy to capitalize off the hit show.

'Phil Robertson should look African American and gay people in the eyes and hear about the hurtful impact of praising Jim Crow laws and comparing gay people to terrorists.

'If dialogue with Phil is not part of next steps then A+E has chosen profits over African American and gay people – especially its employees and viewers,' the said.

The fourth season is set to premiere this January, and was largely completed before Phil made the statements, meaning he didn't miss a single episode of filming during the ban.

The removal of the 67-year-old patriarch from the show was lauded by gay rights organizations, but fans of the show denounced it as a violation of Robertson's right to free speech.
