If you thought Japanese food was all miso soup and sushi, think again.

One Tokyo restaurant that specialises in French cuisine is spearheading a filthy new food fad and has launched a full course menu of dishes all made with dirt.

Courses include potato starch and dirt soup and dirt dressed salad ... there's even a dirt ice cream.

Getting the dirt on a new food trend: Potato starch and dirt soup served in a shot glass with slice of black truffle

Not only does this sound like a torturous exercise, but to eat this restaurant's dirty offerings you'll have to make reservations at least a week in advance due to high demand.

And you'll also have to fork out £70 for the pleasure.

As odd and lethal as this menu sounds, the well-known French restaurant that boasts it as a hot new thing swears that the the dirt is made with harmless 'coffee grinds and palm fiber', as reported by Rocket News 24.

Supplied by soil company Protoleaf, the dirt product was previously discarded as surplus, but now they sell it as a novel and eco-friendly compost - safe for human consumption.

The chic restaurant in Tokyo’s Gotanda district, Ne Quittez Pas, is apparently famous for using high-quality seafood and produce from Kanagawa’s Misaki region. However, their new menu is created around the last ingredient any foodie would consider a luxury.

The chef at Ne Quittez Pas recently won a TV cooking show battle with a sauce made with dirt ... but is the menu worth getting down and dirty for?

Rocket News 24 shared their experience with MailOnline: 'The first course: a potato starch and dirt soup. It arrived in a shot glass looking so dark brown, it was almost black. It definitely looked like it had dirt in it. A slice of black truffle was balanced on top, and the staff instructed us to take a bite of it and then try the soup. So we did… and it was divine! There wasn’t a dirty flavor at all. Instead, this simple soup went down smoothly with just a hint of potato flavor,''The rim of the shot glass was dusted with salt like a margarita, so after the initial saltiness, your mouth filled with the mild flavor of the soup. The dish impressed us more with the chef’s skill than with the potential of the unusual ingredient, though,' they added.

The fish looks good, shame about the rice: It's fit for consumption and a novelty, so would you try it?

The restaurant also serves a salad of grilled eggplant, tomato and turnips with dirt dressing and a fine powder made from ground popcorn.

Also on the menu is a dish called 'minerals of the sea and minerals of the land' - clams, a layer of sediment, dirt risotto and sauteed sea bass and burdock root, and for dessert there's dirt ice cream with dirt gratin and 'cleansing' dirt mint tea.

The writer was impressed overall: 'With its mild cuisine, sweet desserts and refreshing tea, the course had the flavor and modulation you would expect from Ne Quittez Pas’s talented chef.

'As to why the meal didn’t taste at all of dirt, that is likely due to the dirt itself.'
