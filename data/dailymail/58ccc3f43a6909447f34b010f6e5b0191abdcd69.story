Steven Gerrard is holding talks with Liverpool over a possible contract extension, manager Brendan Rodgers has revealed.

The 34-year-old's current deal expires in June 2015, meaning he would be allowed to hold talks with other clubs in January.

Rodgers explained he had met with Gerrard's agent and then approached the club's owners about  securing a new deal for the club captain.

Speaking to BT Sport, Rodgers said: 'Steven is a wonderful player. The situation is very simple. I have already spoken with Steven's representative over a week ago so a real productive good conversation and we took that to the ownership and they are obviously now in the process of getting a deal hopefully agreed and done.

'In terms of Steven, he's a player of course we want to keep. He has been a big part of my plans since I have been here. 

'I've said it a number of times, he's a player that going forward I still want to very much be a part of my plans so hopefully that can be done very soon.'

After losing talismanic striker Luis Suarez in the summer, Rodgers will be keen to avoid the departure of further influential players.

The club experienced huge change over the summer, with nine new players arriving, and Rodgers admitted the process was more a matter of necessity than preference.

'It was not even a bold step (to do that),' said Rodgers on Friday. 'It's what we had to do. We couldn't go this season with the same group of players. And also we lost a top player.

'So some of it had to be done. It was clear we needed to do that and it is clear that some of the young players that have come in, we've see their qualities. It's just going to take them time to adapt.'

Rodgers added: 'The players we brought in were not really established. With young players, you get mistakes. Then there is the lifestyle. You have adaptation, new players coming into a different way of life. It may be difficult for other people to understand it because of where we were last season.

'As I said the natural progress of the team was halted a wee bit because we lost a world class talent.'
