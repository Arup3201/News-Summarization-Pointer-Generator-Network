Fight back: Dorothy Hendrix managed to shoot one of her suspected attackers before she was shot dead

A 76-year-old woman was killed in a shootout as a gang tried to rob her outside her South Carolina home in the early hours of Saturday.

Dorothy Hendrix was shot twice by the gang of two men and a woman, but she managed to shoot one of her assailants in the stomach before dying of her wounds.

Steven Hagood, Tereba Geer, and Bradacious Galloway have all been charged with murder.

'She fought. She was a fighter. She shot
 him,' the victimâ€™s brother, Ronnie Lollis, told WYFF News Channel 4.

Ms Hendrix, who was known as Dot to her friends, had been returning to her Anderson County home at 1am when the gang allegedly tried to rob her.

The 76-year-old fired at the group and one of them fired back, hitting Ms Hendrix in the abdomen and the arm.

A neighbor called police after hearing the gunshots, but Ms Hendrix died outside her home while a relative held her hand.

Hagood, who she shot in the stomach, was taken to hospital where he is under guard. As well as being charged with murder, the 33-year-old has been served with a family bench warrant for unpaid child support of $80,000.

The two other suspects, Geer, 26, and Galloway, 23, also face murder charges.

Ms Hendrix, who volunteered at a bingo club, had applied for a carry and conceal weapon and learned to shoot after being robbed outside the same home in 2011.

The robbers behind the earlier attack were never caught, and police have not said whether they believe the two incidents are connected.

Anderson County Sheriff John Skipper said: 'This was not a random act. The robbery was planned, and she was specifically targeted.'

'The trio had knowledge that Hendrix carried large sums of money home with her at night,' he added.

Mr Lollis said his sister had learned to fire a gun after the earlier attack, and had a carry and conceal permit, according to News 13.

'She had been robbed right here at her 
house, coming out of her house. That's what made her get her gun. I 
don't understand why she wanted to keep coming back,' he said.
