The number of working days lost to strikes almost doubled last year to more than 440,000, it emerged today.

As David Cameron plans a crackdown on trade unions, new figures showed almost half of all days lost were in education after teachers staging walkouts.

The Tories sought to pin the blame on Labour leader Ed Miliband, claiming his ‘chums at the top of the trade unions’ were putting the economic recovery in peril.

The Office for National Statistics said there were 443,600 working days lost in the UK last year as a result of 114 separate stoppages, up from 249,000 lost days in 2012.

In total, there were 50 public sector walkouts and 64 in the private sector.

However, the number of working days lost in the public sector rose sharply from 198,000 in 2012 to 363,000 in 2013.

Overall 82 per cent of all working days lost were in the public sector. ‘This reflects the relatively large one-off strikes that occurred in the public sector in 2013,’ the ONS said.

Almost all strikes called last year were in rows over pay, a major change to 2010 when the majority were in protest at redundancies as coalition’s spending cuts began to bite.

Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps told MailOnline: ‘While we are working to secure Britain’s future, Ed Miliband’s chums at the top of the trade unions are trying to take us backwards.

‘This massive hike in strike damage to our economy is a national scandal. It is a stinging slap in the face to British people and their families who are trying to work hard.

‘Ed Miliband is too weak to stand up to his trade union paymasters. He just isn’t up to it.’

Unions are to be banned from going out on strike on low turnouts or using old ballots of members under Tory plans to end disruption of public services.

David Cameron last week revealed the Conservative party manifesto will include plans to legislate on the rules on staging walkouts

Last week Mr Cameron revealed the Conservative party manifesto will include plans to legislate on the rules on staging walkouts.

Up to a million teachers, council workers, health workers, firefighters and civil servants staged a strike across England and Wales last week. More disruption is expected later this year.

The threat of industrial action in protest at spending cuts and pay restraint has been condemned by the government,

However, the ONS said the scale of strikes has fallen in the last two decades. 'Looking at the last 20 years compared with the previous 20 years shows that the average number of working days lost per year has decreased considerably from 7.8 million days in the period 1973-1992 to 615,700 days in the period 1993-2012.'

The high number of days lost in 2011 was due to a couple of large public sector strikes, while the 2002 figure was due to one very large stoppage in the transport and storage industry.
