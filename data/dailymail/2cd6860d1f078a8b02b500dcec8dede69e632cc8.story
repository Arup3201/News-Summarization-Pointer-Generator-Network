Traditional maps are still the navigation aid of choice among British motorists - but only just.

In-car satellite navigation is inching ahead of the printed road atlas and is already first choice of younger drivers, according to a report from the AA.

Its poll of nearly 24,000 drivers found nearly two thirds (63 per cent) of motorists had used a printed map in the past six months, compared to 60 per cent who used sat nav.

Trusted tool: The faithful printed road map wins out, being used by 63 per cent of drivers

Just over a third (35 per cent) of drivers say they use both sat nav, and an atlas as back-up to plan a route - with just one in six (17 per cent) relying solely on sat nav.

Regionally the proportion relying solely on sat nav ranges from one in five (20 per cent) in London to just one in seven (14 per cent ) in the South West.

Younger drivers aged 18 to 24 are the group most likely to ignore maps altogether, with nearly half (43 per cent) depending on their sat navs alone to navigate the nation's roads.

By contrast, fewer than one in ten (9 per cent) of over 65 year olds have ditched printed maps altogether, preferring a hard copy of the nation's highways to a digital direction-finder.

Among those using both, the highest level is in Eastern England (40 per cent) compared to Scotland at just 27 per cent.

About one in five (19 per cent) have used a print-out of the AA's own Route planner.

Overall just over one in ten (11 per cent) plan their routes with a map combined with written instructions.

However, just one in 20 (5 per cent) of 18 to 24 year olds do this compared to one in seven (15per cent) of over 65s.

On the rise: 60 per cent of road users said they had used a sat nav recently, and many young people say it is the only way they find out where to go

When planning a route around one in 14 (7 per cent) use on-line maps, the same proportion use only a printed map, and one in every 100 say they never travel far enough to need a map or sat nav.

The poll coincides with the launch of a new book called 'Mapping the Roads' by maps expert and author Mike Parker (AA Publishing, Â£25).

Mr Parker said: 'The younger generation may be changing the way maps are used but even those using sat navs are still dependent on the mapping behind the devices, so maps and mapping the roads are still vital for the future of road travel.'

He noted: 'Technology has brought us in-car navigation systems to make getting around without a human navigator far easier. However, there are numerous tales of those who rely solely on this technology finding themselves in either completely the wrong location or on inappropriate roads for their vehicles.

'With a good map, you can quite literally see the bigger picture, get a sense of the context of the landscape through which you're travelling and hunt down some unexpected gems along the way.'

He added: 'The story of Britain's road development is also the story of its political, economic and social history, and the car, more than any other single factor, has shaped our landscape and changed our maps.

'Many people have a love-hate relationship with our busy, bustling, often congested, roads.

'Roads might be seen as a necessary evil to get us through the 'rush hour' to work but they also give us the freedom to live in different places, to visit friends and relatives, to travel and explore the many wonders that our country has to offer.

Advances: Many cars, such as this Vauxhall Astra, now have built-in navigation systems

'Without roads and maps our lives would be very different.'

AA president Edmund King said: 'Most motorists are still turning to maps when planning car journeys even in the age of high tech navigation systems.'

He noted: 'As a nation, the British are obsessed with directions and maps; just ask a group of people for directions and you will likely receive a variety of routes based on personal preferences and shortcut knowledge. '

He said: 'As the country's road network has developed, so has the technology behind the mapping.

'We depend on our road network for 86 per cent of passenger journeys and more than 90 per cent of freight including almost everything we buy in the shops or online.

'So knowing the best route is crucial to making these journeys as easy as possible. '
