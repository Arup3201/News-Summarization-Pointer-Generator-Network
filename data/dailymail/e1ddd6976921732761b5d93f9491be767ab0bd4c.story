Former Liverpool director of football Damien Comolli believes his decision to splash out £16million on Jordan Henderson played a part in his dismissal from the club.

Comolli, who joined Liverpool in 2010, has revealed he was not told why he was sacked in 2012 but that he was 'led to believe' that Henderson's arrival at Anfield was the main reason for his departure.

Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, Comolli said: 'When we signed Jordan Henderson, he got so much criticism, I got so much criticism.

'I was never told why I was sacked but I was led to believe it was because we signed Jordan Henderson, and the owners were convinced he was not good enough.

'Looking at all this, what he was doing for his age, and all due respect to Sunderland, he was definitely undervalued by the market. And I’ve been told we overvalued him. Even directors at Sunderland later said "you didn’t know what you were doing".'

Henderson has gone on to become a key member of Brendan Rodgers' squad and was named vice-captain of last season's runners-up in September.
