House Speaker John Boehner today branded NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden a 'traitor' as U.S. officials reportedly start the process of filing charges against him for leaking government secrets.

Snowden, 29, an employee of 
government contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, has admitted that he provided documents 
about government spying operations to The Guardian newspaper.

He has fled to Hong Kong to elude U.S. authorities, but CBS reported on Tuesday that officials are now preparing to bring charges against him.

'He's a traitor,' Boehner told ABC News. 'The disclosure of this 
information puts Americans at risk.  It shows our adversaries what our 
capabilities are. And it’s a giant violation of the law.'

Boehner backed President Obama's characterization of two surveillance programs, which allow the NSA to gather information about phone calls and data collected from major internet companies.

He said the programs protect the country by helping officials fight terrorism.

'The president outlined last week that these were important national security programs to help keep Americans safe, and give us tools to fight the terrorist threat that we face,' Boehner said.

'The president also outlined that there are appropriate safeguards in place to make sure that there’s no snooping, if you will, on Americans here at home.'

Senate intelligence chairwoman Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California has also accused Snowden of committing an 'act of treason' that should be prosecuted.

The tough talk comes as Snowden's employers, Booz Allen Hamilton, announced on Tuesday that it has terminated his contract 'for violations of the firm’s code of ethics and firm policy'.

Leak: Edward Snowden, who worked as a contract employee at the National Security Agency, has fled to Hong Kong after leaking government surveillance secrets. The U.S. is preparing to charge him

Russia today hinted that Vladimir Putin would grant political asylum to Edward Snowden.

'We will take action based on what actually happens. If we receive such a request, it will be considered,' said the Russian president's official spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

One Russian report stressed that the country has a consulate in Hong Kong where Snowden could make an asylum request.

Russian MP Robert Schlegel urged the Kremlin to look at a the possibility of granting political asylum to Snowden. 'It would be a good idea,' he said.

It's unknown where Snowden will actually go, but Snowden had mentioned Iceland, a tiny island nation of 360,000, as a possibility.

It said that the claims he had leaked information were 'shocking' - and revealed that he was earning $122,000 rather than the $200,000 he told The Guardian he was paid.

As for his future prospects - although Hong Kong has an extradition
 treaty with the U.S., the document has some exceptions, including for 
crimes deemed political.

Any negotiations about his possible handover will involve Beijing, but some believe China is unlikely to want to jeopardize its relationship with the U.S. over someone of little political interest to them.

Snowden also told The Guardian that he may seek asylum in Iceland, which has strong free-speech protections and a tradition of providing a haven for the outspoken and the outcast.

The Justice Department is 
investigating whether his disclosures were a criminal offense - a matter
 that's not always clear-cut under U.S. federal law.

A senior intelligence official
 said Snowden would have had to have signed a non-disclosure agreement 
to gain access to the top secret data.

That suggests he could be prosecuted for violating that agreement. Penalties could range from a few years to life in prison.

Hiding place: Snowden is in Hong Kong, pictured, but his exact whereabouts are unknown

Edward Snowden has fled to Hong Kong, which is a gamble, but the country's free speech laws mean he does have a slim chance of avoiding being swept back to America if the government demand he returns.

Hong Kong signed an extradition treaty with the United States in 1997, just before Britain handed it back to China. In it both agreed to send fugitives back and forth in the majority of cases, but there were also political exemptions negotiated at the time.

Hong Kong has the 'right of refusal when surrender implicates the "defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy'' of the People's Republic of China'.

China itself has no extradition treaty with America at all.

Hong Kong officials also have the right to say no to extradition if they believe that the attempt is 'politically motivated'. This means that they will protect free speech if a person is being arrested just for their political opinions.

The United States may have already approached Interpol or its consulate in Hong Kong to start proceedings. They will use the Espionage Act to gain warrants for his arrest.

Hong Kong's authorities can hold Snowden for 60 days, following a U.S. request that includes probable cause, while Washington prepares a formal extradition request.

'I think it is really tragic that an American has to move to a place that has a reputation for less freedom,' he told The Guardian.

Snowden's exact whereabouts were unknown on Monday.

If Snowden is forced to return to the 
United States to face charges, whistle-blower advocates said Monday that
 they would raise money for his legal defense.

'All of the options, as he put it, 
are bad options,' Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, who first 
reported the program and interviewed Snowden extensively, told The 
Associated Press.

He said Snowden decided to release 
details of the programs out of shock and anger over the sheer scope of 
the government's privacy invasions.

'It was his choice to publicly unveil himself,' Greenwald said.

'He recognized that even if he hadn't
 publicly unveiled himself, it was only a matter of time before the U.S.
 government discovered that it was he who had been responsible for these
 disclosures, and he made peace with that... He's very steadfast and 
resolute about the fact that he did the right thing.'

Greenwald told the AP that he had more documents from Snowden and expected 'more significant revelations' about NSA.

As questions surround his future, global and U.S. outrage at the programs continues.

In
 Washington, members of Congress said they would take a new look at 
potential ways to keep the U.S. safe from terror attacks without giving 
up privacy protections that critics charge are at risk with the 
government's current authority to broadly sweep up personal 
communications.

'There's 
very little trust in the government, and that's for good reason,' said 
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, who sits on the House Intelligence 
Committee. 'We're our own worst enemy.'

A
 senior U.S. intelligence official on Monday said there were no plans to
 scrap the programs that, despite the backlash, continue to receive 
widespread if cautious support within Congress.

The programs were revealed last week by The Guardian and The Washington Post newspapers.

'No options': Glenn Greenwald, a reporter for The Guardian, said Snowden has no great options

National Intelligence Director James 
Clapper has taken the unusual step of declassifying some of the 
previously top-secret details to help the administration mount a public 
defense of the surveillance as a necessary step to protect Americans.

One of the NSA programs gathers hundreds of millions of U.S. phone records to search for possible links to known terrorist targets abroad. The other allows the government to tap into nine U.S. Internet companies and gather all communications to detect suspicious behavior that begins overseas.

Snowden is a former CIA employee who later worked as a contractor for the NSA on behalf of Booz Allen, where he gained access to the surveillance.

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine said, it was 'absolutely shocking' that a 29-year-old with limited experience and no formal qualifications would have access to this material.

FBI agents on Monday visited the home of Snowden's father, Lonnie Snowden, in Upper Macungie Township, Pennsylvania. The FBI in Philadelphia declined to comment.
