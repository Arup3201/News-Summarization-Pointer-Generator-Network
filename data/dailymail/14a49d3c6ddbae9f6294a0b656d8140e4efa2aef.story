Yasine Chikhaoui scored a late goal to give Tunisia a 2-1 win over Zambia at the African Cup of Nations on Thursday.

Chikhaoui headed in a cross from Youssef Msakni in the 89th minute to give the Tunisians four points in Group B. Zambia, who have not won a match at the tournament since winning the title in 2012, has one point.

Emmanuel Mayuka gave Zambia the lead in the 59th, smashing in a cross from captain Rainford Kalaba. But Ahmed Akaichi equalized with a header in the 70th following a flicked-on corner.

Zambia: Mweene, Nkausa, Sunzu, Mbola, Munthali, Mtonga, Musonda, Kalaba, Singuluma, Mayuka (Mwanza, 71), Kangwa. 

Goal: Mayuka, 59  

Tunisia: Aymen Mathlouthi, Syam Ben Youssef, Abdennour, Maaloul, Bedoui, Ragued, Khazri (Ali Moncer, 66), Saihi (Sassi, 75), M'Sakni, Chikhaoui, Akaichi (Younes, 80). 

Goal: Akaichi, 70, Chikhaoui, 89

Tunisia's first goal came as Zambia was playing with 10 men because of an injury to Mayuka.

The Zambians came close several times in the first half, with Kalaba and Mayuka linking up well. 

After Mayuka finally scored, he did back-flips in celebration.

In the 67th, Kalaba again sent a cross for Mayuka, but the Zambia forward was injured as he slid to reach the ball. 

He was soon taken off the field on a stretcher, and Tunisia equalised before he was replaced by Jackson Mwanza.

The result was tough for Zambia coach Honour Janza to take after a positive performance

Zambia have struggled since winning the 2012 African Cup. 

The team drew all three of its group matches at the 2013 tournament and was eliminated. This year, they have taken the lead in both matches, but they drew 1-1 with Congo in their opening match before losing on Thursday.

Tunisia will play its final group match against Congo on Monday in Bata, while Zambia will take on Cape Verde in Ebebiyin.
