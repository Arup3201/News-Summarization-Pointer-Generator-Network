She is frequently seen jogging near her Downing St home, and is said to attend private pilates classes at Number 10 in a bid to keep her slender figure fighting fit.

So it came as no surprise to see Samantha Cameron pedalling around Westminster on a hybrid bike today.

Not for Samantha the trendy single speed
or sit-up-and-beg styles that have become so prevalent among Londoners 
and New Yorkers. 

Samantha Cameron was sure to put safety first as she pedalled around Westminster today wearing a safety helmet and high visibility band

The 41-year-old Prime Minister's wife was riding a Pinnacle hybrid - a simple aluminium-framed bike with 24 gears with slender tyres making it suited to road cycling but more robust than a racer bike.

Pinnacle hybrid bikes sell at Evans and similar cycle stores for around £300, depending on the model.

And sensible Samantha was sure to 
wear suitable clothing for the outing - her navy wool coat, dark jeans 
and patent brogues were accessorised with a Specialized safety helmet 
and high visibility band.

She's passed her cycling proficiency test! Samantha gave clear hand signals as she cycled around the central London postcode this morning

A Pinnacle hybrid, similar to Samantha Cameron's, on sale at Evans

 Evans describe a bike in a similar style to Samantha Cameron's as a hybrid. They say:

'The Pinnacle Lithium One 2012 Women's Hybrid Bike has all the attributes of the tough Lithium category with MTB V-brakes to reduce overall weight and cost without any lack of stopping power.

'Shimano 7-speed gearing is totally reliable and the wheels are proven Alex G6000s, rims that shrug off rough road surfaces much better than most.

'For added comfort, a narrower handlebar, shorter stem and cranks and women's saddle finish off the package

'With big wheels and an attitude, the Lithium is a fast and light weight women's city ride with a heavyweight character. It's based on a rigid 29er MTB layout for a confident and comfortable fit for a female rider, designed with handling that suits the cut-n-paste of city short-cuts and emergency manoeuvres.

'Tough tyres, deep-section rims and a steel fork add to the security you'll feel from behind the wide riser bar, while reflective frame decals help you stay visible in dimly-lit areas.

'It's a true hybrid with the best elements of 29" MTBs and 700c urban genres rolled into one bike.'
