The sell off of memorabilia from Barry Island's Pleasure Park would surely cause Nessa to question what was occurring. 

Everything from the slot machines to the tuppenny donkey derby rides are up for grabs for a 'tidy' sum in a special clear-out of attractions from the park featured in the popular BBC comedy series.

Gavin and Stacey written  by Ruth Jones and James Corden was filmed in and around Barry Island, which was home to main character Stacey Shipman and her bestfriend Vanessa 'Nessa' Jenkins.

It told the story of the romance between Stacey, Joanna Page and Essex boy Gavin, Matthew Horne. 

Nessa, played by Ruth Jones, worked in an amusement arcade keeping watch on the slot machines near the fair.

The show also starred Corden, Rob Brydon, Alison Steadman and Larry Lamb.

The fair has been an attraction in Glamorgan, South Wales, since 1920 and had 400,000 visitors over a bank holiday at its peak in 1934. 

It struggled after the nearby Butlins holiday camp closed 18 years ago. 

'It is a very sad day indeed,' said the iconic pleasure park co-owner Ian Rogers.

'I have been at Barry Island since I was 16 years old and was here when my father, Ken Rogers, bought the pleasure park in 1995.

'It was my dream to put the pleasure park under cover, but that was not to be. Now we are where we are.

'I think after this I'll take a year off to consider what I'll do with my life.'

It is not only the rides, including a 'tea cups and saucers'  and a small merry-go-round, that are up for sale but also various small toys and other goods from the shop and arcades.

Mr Rogers, 52, said: 'Everything must go. People can come here and make an offer.

As well as the rides people can also buy goods that were due to be sold in the Pleasure Parks shops

'There is no price tag. Anyway, how can you put a price on such great memories?'

Gaming machines in the arcades, which cost between £600 and £1,000, will  be sold for between £50 and £100.

'My favourite machine is the Derby Ride,' said Mr Rogers.

'It is the end of an era.'

The 4.5-acre pleasure park is set to be taken over and redeveloped by fairground veteran Henry Danter, provided agreement can be reached on a housing scheme planned  at the park's entrance.
