There was a time when Chris Woakes was a peripheral figure with England, seemingly destined to be a nearly man not quite good enough at the highest level with either ball or bat. Not any more.

Now Woakes, after taking his chance in Sri Lanka and in the first match of the tri-series against Australia in Sydney on Friday, has become the most important bowling name on England’s World Cup team-sheet.

That is some achievement when you consider that England have Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, Chris Jordan and, as long as he can regain fitness, Jimmy Anderson at their disposal for a one-day tour that began with defeat at the SCG.

England showed how valuable Woakes has become in 50-over cricket when he took the new ball ahead of Broad in Sydney, returned at the death and responded by being the most successful and quickest bowler on show.

It was not enough to enable England to defend the meagre 234 all out that saw the wounds of the traumatic Ashes tour re-opened by Australia but it was a promising sign of what Woakes can deliver in the World Cup challenges to come.

‘Yes I hope so,’ said Woakes yesterday when asked if he finally felt established, at 25, with England. ‘Sri Lanka was good for me and, with Jimmy and Broady not being around, it gave guys who have not played as much an opportunity to stake a claim.

‘I felt like I did that there and I’m trying to continue it here. It is nice to know that I’ve performed well at international level now. I’ve been in and out and haven’t known if I was going to play or not. It does help if you know you’ve got a good chance of playing. It’s a confidence booster.’

England travelled to Brisbane on Friday to face that other one-day powerhouse in India on Tuesday and it was at the Gabba four years ago that Woakes announced himself with a six-wicket haul against Australia.

It has taken since then for him to fulfil his obvious potential and it was another six-wicket return against Sri Lanka in Kandy before Christmas – which made Woakes the first England bowler to take two six-wicket one-day hauls – that convinced England he is now the real deal.

In Sydney he added another four wickets in the key scalps of David Warner, Aaron Finch, George Bailey and Glenn Maxwell but, sadly, not before Warner had hit the century that confirmed Australia as the team to beat in the World Cup.

‘I thought we bowled reasonably okay and it would have been nice to have a bigger total to defend but unfortunately it wasn’t to be,’ said Woakes.

‘They were trying to finish the game in a hurry which gave opportunities and to pick up wickets was brilliant. I felt I bowled well with the new ball and got my rewards later on.’

Clearly, the ‘yard’ of pace that the Warwickshire all-rounder has added to his bowling, as well as the variety that saw him successfully mix it up at the death in Sydney, has been the key to his new-found senior status.

‘Looking at the big screen, I saw I was bowling at around 140 kph (87 miles per hour),’ said Woakes. ‘Probably 18 months ago I was only bowling at 130, 132, 134 max. I definitely feel I’ve put on a yard. Maybe a bit more than 140 occasionally. It’s good for me to see.

‘It has been a gradual process. I’ve been working on it for a couple of years now, starting with Graeme Welch at Warwickshire and Kevin Shine at Loughborough during my Lions period. There were a few technical issues to sort out and I also feel now I’m more energetic in my run up. So there has been hard work and it hasn’t just happened overnight. It’s good to see the rewards.’

Woakes is very much a three-dimensional cricketer too. He is a dangerous lower middle order hitter and an athletic fielder, even if he did nearly make a hash of a straightforward chance that came his way during England’ s tour match win against a Prime Minister’s XI in Canberra.

Woakes juggled the catch on the boundary, went to ground and kicked it up, football style, before pouching it, to his immense relief.

‘You’re not going to believe me but I reckon I meant to do it,’ said Woakes. ‘I misjudged the catch to begin with, so I made a meal of it, then as soon as it was rolling down my leg, I tried to kick the ball to get it up. Fortunately it came back to me and stuck.

‘I thought it was my right foot but everybody says it was my left. It definitely hit my boot. I’m a Villa fan. Perhaps they could do with me at the moment.’

The emergence of Woakes, who also played in the last three Tests of last summer against India, has been important for England. Anderson needs to play on Tuesday to ease concerns that he is struggling to regain full fitness after missing the Sri Lanka tour to rest his troublesome knee.

Woakes has been working hard on his bowling action over the last two years to increase his pace

Meanwhile, Broad is still easing his way back to full fitness after knee surgery of his own, Jordan can be erratic and Steven Finn sadly still looks a shadow of the bowler who was among the best in the world in one-day cricket barely two years ago.

He is getting better but, as his clattering into the stumps on Friday showed, Finn is far from over the problems that forced him to be sent home from Brisbane this time last year.

Add the fact that Eoin Morgan seems to have reservations about the effectiveness of James Tredwell, hence his decision to leave him out on a dry, worn SCG pitch on Friday, and it is clear to see that England’s one-dimensional bowling is a bigger worry than the batting which failed them on Friday.

The need for Woakes to carry on emerging as the unlikely leader of the one-day attack, then, is vitally important here for England.
