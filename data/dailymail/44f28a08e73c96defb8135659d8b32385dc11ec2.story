Tragic: Connar Kiedyk died after he was hanged by a dressing gown cord while playing Cowboys and Indians in his bedroom, an inquest has heard

A nine-year-old boy died after he strangled himself on a dressing gown cord while playing Cowboys and Indians in his bedroom.

Connar Kiedyk was found hanged from his bunk bed by his sister in June last year.

He had been excited when the Olympic torch had visited his primary school earlier the same day.

An inquest at Cleethorpes Town Hall, Lincolnshire, heard how Connar's sister had been sent upstairs to ask her brother to sign a form as part of a change to his family's doctors surgery when she found him hanged.

She ran downstairs and told her mother Ursula Kiedyk that Connar might have 'done something very stupid.'

Mrs Kiedyk ran upstairs to Connar's room in Grimsby, called an ambulance and attempted to revive her son.

Connar, who had been adopted by Mrs Kiedyk and her husband Anthony in 2009, died shortly afterwards at the nearby Diana Princess of Wales Hospital.

The inquest heard how Connar had been upstairs playing his favourite Cowboys and Indians game using his toy soldiers when he became caught on his bunk bed.

Mrs Kiedyk told the coroner that Connar had a bunk bed in his room with no bottom bunk in it so that he had more space to play and that she had asked him to tidy his room that evening.

She said: 'Connar would usually shove everything in a corner and say it's done, and then said "I'll go check" which meant it wasn't tidy.

'Certain toys had to be downstairs in order for us to keep an eye on him with them, but we had no problems with his toy soldiers in his bedroom which he used to play Cowboys and Indians with.'

The coroner dismissed any link between the incident and concerns that Connar was being bullied by classmates about his upcoming birthday party.

'He was a very caring young boy and took matters into his 
own hands to help others.'

Connar had reported to staff at the Wellholme Community Primary School that his peers had said it would be 'rubbish'.

Staff at the 550 pupil school described him as an 'endearing and bouncy' boy.

Tina Burns, a learning mentor at the school, said: 'He was a very caring young boy and took matters into his own hands to help others.

'He enjoyed the extra attention and had been on a long and successful journey until he died.'

Another teacher added: 'If Connar was being bullied, it was my responsibility to take care of it, and I saw no evidence of it.

'He was an irrepressible but very bright young man.'

District Coroner Paul Kelly recorded an accidental death verdict.

He said: 'Connar was a warm little chap and a much loved child.

'There were no adverse matters or third party involvement in Connar's death.

'Connar was playing Cowboys and Indians at the time, and it was an experiment involving his dressing gown which cost him his life.'

Mrs Kiedyk paid tribute to her 'lively and bubbly' little boy after the hearing.

She said: 'He was impulsive, and had no fear - except for spiders when he cried like a little girl.

'He had been really excited about his upcoming birthday party just a few weeks after his death and he was really excited about seeing the Olympic torch on the day he died.

'He told me on the off chance that someone had been picking on him about his party, but after that he got on with his usual routine of playing upstairs.

'He loved school and although he got into mischief himself, he never wanted to cause any intentional harm. He once told me he had 32 best friends.

'He understood dangers, but he was always willing to try things in practice.'
