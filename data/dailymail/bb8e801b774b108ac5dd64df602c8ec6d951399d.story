Fashion designer Alexander McQueen loathed Victoria Beckham and 'barred her from his catwalk show because he thought she was stupid', a new tell-all book claims.

The British designer, who committed suicide aged 40 in 2010, apparently banned the former pop star from wearing his clothes and turned down the chance to have her attend his catwalk show.

McQueen's supposed animosity towards the established fashion designer has been outlined in Gods And Kings, a revelatory biography of McQueen and his rival, John Galliano, by Dana Thomas.

Its release comes as Mrs Beckham, who has four children with husband David, continues to receive rave reviews for her latest fashion collection at New York Fashion Week.

The book recalls McQueen's 2001 Voss collection show at the bus depot in Victoria, London, and reveals how it started late because actress Gwyneth Paltrow was stuck in traffic. McQueen allegedly said the show could not start until she arrived.

However, author and journalist Ms Thomas claims in her book that the former Spice Girl, 40, didn't receive such treatment.

She writes: 'Not all celebrities were so lucky — or respected — chez McQueen. Victoria Beckham asked to attend and he turned her down.'

She claims he said: 'F****** right. At the end of the day, it's about my clothes and the hard work that everyone backstage puts into it, not about the t***** sitting in the front row lapping it up.

'And that's why I didn't let Posh Spice come to it… The stars you see at my shows, be it Gwyneth Paltrow, be it anyone else, are there because I've got a connection with them… [I design for] intelligent women.'

It has also previously been claimed that McQueen was furious when he saw photographs of Mrs Beckham wearing his classic tartan skirt in 2006.

In July last year, fashion stylist Archie Reed, who was McQueen's lover – on and off – for 12 years and his closest confidant, revealed that McQueen had 'exploded in fury' after seeing the picture.

The designer counted a host of famous faces among his friends including Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss

He told the Mail: 'He said: "David can wear my clothes but she can't."

'He thought David was hot, but he couldn't abide Victoria. After he saw her in his tartans he put out the word that she wasn't allowed to get any freebies any more.

'Lee didn't rate her as a fashion designer at all and used to say: "What the f*** does she know about fashion? She's a pop star, and she can't even sing."

'No matter how famous he was, he always used to say that celebrity and celebrities didn't matter to him at all.'

However, despite the late fashion designer's apparent animosity towards Mrs Beckham, she has never hinted at any feud and gave a touching tribute to McQueen when he passed away.

Following his death on February 10, 2010, which came just eight days after his mother Joyce passed away from kidney failure, Mrs Beckham said: 'Today, the fashion industry has lost a true great. An icon of all time. He made all he touched beautiful and will be desperately missed.

'McQueen was a master of fashion, creative genius and an inspiration.

'My heart is very much with his family and friends at this very sad time.'
