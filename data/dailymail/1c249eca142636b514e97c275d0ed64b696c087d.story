Canoe fraudster John Darwin, 63, pictured leaving Teesside Crown Court, Middlesbrough, has only repaid £122 of the £500,000 he scammed

Canoe fraudster John Darwin has only repaid £122 of the £500,000 he cheated in an insurance scam – and has even been claiming benefits.

The 63-year-old, who was jailed for six years with his wife Anne in 2008 for faking his death for a £500,000 insurance payout, has now been told he may have to repay more money.

A judge had previously ordered he should repay £679,073 but the now divorced Darwin, who is claiming benefits, has only been able to hand back £122.

The Crown Prosecution Service has now applied for him to repay more of the money he cheated out of insurance companies, as one of his pensions has matured.

A hearing to decide the matter will be held in May.

Darwin, 63, of Hartlepool, North-East England, did not speak during the brief Proceeds of Crime Act hearing at Teesside Crown Court, Middlesbrough.

Anne Darwin, now split from her husband, has repaid more than £500,000 under a separate Proceeds of Crime order.

John Darwin was reported missing in a canoe in the North Sea in March 2002.

His wife collected more than £500,000 in life insurance payouts, while he hid in their home, leaving their two sons to believe he was dead.

In December 2007, Darwin walked into a London police station, claiming he had amnesia, and was reunited with his sons who were stunned to hear he was alive.

His wife, who had fled with him to Panama, pretended to be shocked until a photograph emerged of them posing together after his supposed death.

She was later jailed for six-and-a-half-years for fraud and money-laundering.
