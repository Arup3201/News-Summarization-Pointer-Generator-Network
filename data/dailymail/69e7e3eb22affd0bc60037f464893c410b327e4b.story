Since drones became mainstream there has been a constant battle between pilots and law enforcement agencies about where the unmanned crafts can fly.

Data analysts from San Francisco have created a map of the U.S. that plots where owners can pilot their drones, and where specifically the drones are banned.

The states with the fewest restrictions are revealed as Oregon in the northwest and Maine in the east, while Nevada and California have the most.

The Don't Fly Drones Here map of the U.S (pictured) was created by data analysts Bobby Sudekum and Amy Lee. It plots where in the U.S owners can pilot their drones, and where specifically the drones are banned

In the U.S., the Federal Aviation Authority has a blanket ban on drones flying over restricted airspace including national parks, military bases and within a five mile radius of medium and large airports.

In 2012, the FAA fined a drone owner $10,000 for flying his Zephyr II drone over the University of Virginia.

He was fined because he had used the drone to record photos he later sold to the university.

The FAA said the flight violated regulations that forbid the use of drones in the U.S for commercial reasons.

Following an appeal, Judge Patrick Geragthy overruled the decision claiming the FAA has not issued ‘an enforceable rule governing model aircraft operation.’

He
 added the agency has also ‘historically exempted model aircraft from 
the statutory definitions of ‘aircraft’ by relegating model aircraft to 
voluntary compliance with the [FAA’s 2007] guidelines.’

It was the first time a fine had been dismissed.

Drones are also banned from being used for commercial reasons.

Analysts Bobby Sudekum and Amy Lee plotted the location of these bases across the U.S, using Open Street Map data, the National Park Service and U.S Military Data.

They then built the map in Mapbox.

By zooming all the way out, the whole of the U.S is revealed. Red areas mark the no-fly zones and show the shape and size of the region they cover.

Zooming in, and hovering a mouse over these red regions show what kind of restricted airspace it covers, it also reveals the name of the location.

Drones have always been restricted above military bases and airports for security reasons, but the restriction above national parks only came into effect at the start of this month.

The National Park Service (NPS) outlawed launching, landing, or operating drones on or over federally operated lands and waters.

It was signed by director Jonathan Jarvis on 27 June.

The NPS manages all of the country's national parks, monuments, and various historical sites.

Individual parks had banned drones prior to this agreement, including Yosemite National Park in California in May.

Mr Jarvis said: 'We embrace many activities in national parks because they enhance visitor experience with the iconic natural, historic and cultural landscapes in our care.

'However, we have serious concerns about the negative impact that flying unmanned aircraft is having in parks, so we are prohibiting their use until we can determine the most appropriate policy that will protect park resources and provide all visitors with a rich experience.'

The hope is that the ban will eliminate many noise and nuisance complaints and help ensure safety.

In September, rangers in Mount Rushmore captured a drone that flew over the National Memorial amphitheater in South Dakota.

Then in April, visitors to the Grand Canyon complained about noise from a drone that crashed into the canyon.

‘Unmanned drones like quadcopters and fixed-wing aircraft are at the centre of new airspace regulations by the FAA,’ explained Mr Sudekum.

‘While the FAA deliberates on rules and regulations, states, cities and other national organisations have implemented their own no-fly zones.

‘To help people find safe places to fly, we’ve mapped established no-fly areas where drones are not permitted.

‘There are still many uncertainties around where and how one can fly a remotely operated aircraft. This map is a just a start.’
