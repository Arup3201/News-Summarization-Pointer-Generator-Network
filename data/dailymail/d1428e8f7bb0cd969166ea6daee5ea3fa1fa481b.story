Fugitive whistleblower Edward Snowden has dangerous information that could become the U.S. government's ‘worst nightmare’ if revealed, claims the journalist who first published documents leaked by the former NSA computer analyst.

In an interview with Argentinian newspaper La Nacion, Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald said the U.S. government should be careful in its pursuit of Snowden.

‘Snowden has enough information to cause harm to the U.S. government in a single minute than any other person has ever had,’ Greenwald told the paper.

During Friday's meeting Edward Snowden told human rights activists he plans to stay in Russia temporarily, but officials say they haven't received any request

‘The U.S. government should be on its knees every day begging that nothing happen to Snowden, because if something does happen to him, all the information will be revealed and it could be its worst nightmare.’

Greenwald claims Snowden has documents containing details about U.S. spy programs that capture transmissions in Latin America and how they work.

‘One way of intercepting communications is through a telephone company in the United States that has contracts with telecommunications companies in most Latin American countries,’ Greenwald said.

Last Sunday Brazilian newspaper Globo published Snowden-sourced allegations that the NSA has been monitoring the telephone and e-mail activity of companies and individuals in Brazil for at least ten years.

After the story emerged, Brazilian foreign minister Antonio Patriota said he going to demand an explanation from the U.S. over the allegations.

On Friday, Snowden met with human 
rights activists and said he would seek Russian asylum, at least 
as a temporary measure before going to Venezuela, Bolivia or Nicaragua, 
all of which have offered him asylum.

Snowden arrived at 
Moscow's Sheremetyevo international airport on June 23 from Hong Kong, 
apparently intending to board a flight to Cuba. But he did not get on 
that flight and is believed to have spent the last three weeks marooned 
in the airport's transit zone.

But on Saturday Russian immigration officials said they have not received an 
application from him.

The Interfax news 
agency quoted Russian migration service head Konstantin Romodanovsky as 
saying no asylum request had been received as of Saturday.

The state 
news agency RIA Novosti cited migration service spokeswoman, Zalina 
Kornilova, as also saying no request had been received.

Snowden 
had made a previous bid for Russian asylum, but President Vladimir Putin
 said he would have to agree to stop further leaks of information about 
American intelligence service activities before it would be considered.

Snowden withdrew the bid, but participants in Friday's meeting said he 
was now ready to agree to stop leaks.

President Obama and Vladamir Putin discussed Snowden during a telephone conversation on Friday

Granting asylum to Snowden would add significant new stress to already-troubled Washington-Moscow relations.

Putin
 and President Barack Obama are expected to hold a summit in Moscow in 
early September, right before both take part in the Group of 20 summit 
in St. Petersburg, and the Snowden issue could overshadow both 
gatherings.

Obama and Putin discussed Snowden, among other 
issues, during a telephone call on Friday, the White House said in a 
terse statement that provided no specifics of their conversation about 
the NSA leaker.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said the call was 
planned several days ago, suggesting that it was unrelated to Snowden's 
meeting with the activists.

Russia so far has sidestepped the 
issue by claiming that it cannot take action on Snowden because his 
presence in the transit zone puts him technically outside Russian 
territory. But by agreeing to the condition that he stop leaks, Snowden 
could force Russia's hand.

Friday's meeting in the airport's 
transit zone included representatives of Amnesty International and Human
 Rights Watch. The presence of these internationally respected 
organizations could add weight to Snowden's asylum bid.

U.S. 
State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Friday the United States 
disapproved of Russia facilitating what she called a 'propaganda 
platform' for Snowden, 'despite the government's declarations of 
Russia's neutrality with respect to Mr. Snowden.'

On Saturday, 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov aimed to keep up the appearance 
of neutrality.

'We are not having contact with Snowden,' he said at a 
meeting of a regional security organization in Kyrgyzstan, according to 
Interfax.

The former National Security Agency worker, who revealed details of a U.S.
 intelligence programme to monitor internet activity has been staying in the transit lounge at 
Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport since June 23.

According to Ellen Barry, of the New York Times who was in contact with Tatiana Lokshina, of Human Rights Watch, who was present at the meeting, Snowden said he is recognized as an asylum
 seeker by the UN High Commission on Refugees – but the U.S., he said, 
does not recognize this, as the Morales plane affair showed.

He has urged international organizations to petition the U.S. and EU not to interfere with his right to seek asylum.

Referring
 to Putin's condition that he 
can only stay if he stops harming the U.S., Snowden reportedly  said:
 'No actions I take or plan are meant to harm the U.S. ... I want the U.S.
 to
 succeed.'

Snowden told the meeting that he has received offers from Venezuela, Russia, Bolivia, Nicaragua, and Ecuador and he thanked them all. The offer from Venezuela has been made formally.

He said he accepts all the offers, present and future.
