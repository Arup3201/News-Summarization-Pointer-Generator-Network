The stark difference in the health of Northerners and Southerners was laid bare again today after alarming life expectancy figures were revealed.

A person living in Glasgow is four times more likely to die early - before the age of 75 - from heart disease than someone living in leafy Hampshire.

The statistics, released by the British Heart Foundation (BHF), show an ‘unacceptable’ divide in the heart health of the nation - leading to ‘shocking inequalities’ in the number of deaths from heart and circulatory disease, the charity says.

Figures from the British Heart Foundation show 'shocking inequalities' in the number of deaths from heart (cardiovascular) disease. Map shows where people are more likely to die prematurely from CVD (marked in deep red for between 95 and 144 people per 100,000) through to areas where people are the least likely to die before the age of 75 from CVD (marked in the lightest shade of red for between 35 and 61 people per 100,000)

The charity has released a list of the places with the highest and lowest death rates for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Across the UK, around 100 people under 
the age of 75 die from the condition every day.

It accounts for more 
than one in four of all UK deaths.

The statistics reveal that in Glasgow, 144 people out of every 100,000 under the age of 75 prematurely die from CVD, while only 40 out of every 100,000 in Hart, Hampshire, prematurely die because of such problems.

Other places listed as having high death rates include Manchester, Blackpool, Dundee and Inverclyde, the charity found.

In Manchester, 134 people out of 100,000 die prematurely from CVD, and in Blackpool 125 people in every 100,000 succumb to the disease before the age of 75.

On the 
other end of the scale, parts of Hampshire, Surrey and Cambridgeshire 
have the lowest death rates from heart disease in the under-75s.

In all these places, between 35 and 47 people in every 100,000 under the age of 75 prematurely die from the condition.

‘These
 figures are a stark reminder of the unacceptable number of people that 
lose their lives to cardiovascular disease every year, often increased 
by the place they live,’ said BHF chief executive Simon Gillespie.

‘There is still so much more we need to 
do. We’ve made huge progress in the fight against cardiovascular 
disease, with 70 per cent of heart attack victims now surviving to go 
home to their families.

‘With the help of our supporters, we’ll increase investment and accelerate our world-class research that could save the lives of more people that die prematurely. We remain determined to win the fight against cardiovascular disease, improving the lives of the seven million people living with it and saving those that currently die too young.’

In its new strategy, the charity has said the key to preventing more premature deaths is to make sure research advancements go further and faster.

It aims to tackle health inequalities by preventing people from developing CVD in the first place, which could help reduce early deaths from the disease by 25 per cent by 2025 – the equivalent to 10,000 lives a year.

The latest figures uncovered by the charity show 'shocking inequalities' in the number of deaths from heart and circulatory disease, which claims 440 lives in the UK every day
