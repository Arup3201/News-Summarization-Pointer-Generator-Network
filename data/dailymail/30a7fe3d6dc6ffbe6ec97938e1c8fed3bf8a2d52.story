The cooperation of Chicago twin brothers with federal authorities to bust Mexican drug cartels led to their father's kidnap and death, court documents have revealed. 

Margarito Flores Sr was killed when he travelled south of the border from his home in the Little Village neighborhood of the city in 2009 because his drug-runner sons Pedro and Margarito Jr  were considered to be 'rats'.

A note found at the scene where he was abducted revealed that information the brothers, both 34, provided to agents about the Sinaloa cartel was the main reason for his death.

Their cooperation led to the indictments of leader Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, his top Sinaloa cartel leaders and dozens of other drug wholesalers from Chicago to Mexico, and meant they avoided an almost certain life prison sentence.

Toppled: Their cooperation led to the indictment of Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, the leader of the Sinaloa cartel. He was sentenced to 22 years in prison in November for his part in the $1billion operation 

Prosecutors say the Flores brothers cut deals with Guzman, cartel lieutenant Alfredo Vasquez-Hernandez and others to distribute drugs in several cities, including Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and Washington.

Secret recordings and other evidence provided by the twin brothers in 2008 led to the Chicago indictments of Hernandez and 10 others, including Guzman and the Flores twins themselves. 

In all, the Flores twins pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy involving the distribution of more than 64,500 kilograms of cocaine 

In November Guzman was sentenced to 22 years in prison for his role in a $1 billion trafficking conspiracy. 

The court heard how the cartel leader would fly planes with clothes and goods on a humanitarian mission to Mexico City. On the return journey his associates would pack the plane with around 14 tons of cocaine. 

The case is regarded as one of the U.S. government's most important against Mexican cartels. Guzman remains jailed in Mexico and Mexican authorities haven't said if they might extradite him to Chicago.

According to court documents filed by federal prosecutors this week, and seen by the Chicago Tribune, attorneys will ask U.S. District Chief Judge Ruben Castillo for as little as 10 years in prison for the twins who have been in custody in the witness protection program for more than six years.

Defense attorney Paul Brayman has said that anything longer would be a 'death sentence' for his clients.  

Prosecutors wrote: 'As two of the most well-known cooperating witnesses in the country, the Flores brothers (and their families) will live the rest of their lives in danger of being killed in retribution. The barbarism of the cartels is legend, with a special place reserved for those who cooperate.' 

Investigators relied on the Flores twins to paint 59-year-old Hernandez as a close friend of Guzman who used his logistical skills to ship tons of drugs by train from Mexico to Chicago concealed amid furniture cargo.

But the defense described him as an auto repairman who got caught up in a one-off drug deal.

They also attacked the credibility of the Flores twins, saying they exaggerated Hernandez's role in the cartel to curry favor with prosecutors.
