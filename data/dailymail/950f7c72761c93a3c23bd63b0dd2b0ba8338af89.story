Viewers of a Washington-based sports newscast were horrified Tuesday night when an explicit rendering of the Chicago Cubs' hated new mascot appeared on their screens with genitals in full view for 10 full seconds.

Clark the Cub is the team's first mascot in nearly 100 years, has no pants and was met with jeers immediately after his introduction Monday.

To goad on the Clark hate, sports blog Deadspin invited readers to photoshop parody versions of the bear, one of which ended up in all its au naturel glory on Comcast SportsNet's live broadcast Tuesday.

Oops: CSN Mid-Atlantic accidentally aired a photoshopped version (right) of the Cubs new mascot Clark, complete with an anatomical addition, on Tuesday. The new mascot (left), seen at left, was met with jeers when he was introduced Monday in part because he lacks pants

It was the photoshopped version of 
Clark Deadspin used to kick off its 'Do Something Horrible To The Cubs' 
New, Perverted Mascot' contest on Monday and featured a very prominent 
cartoon penis.

'Clark is a 
young, friendly bear who can't wait to interact with the kids,' CSN 
anchor Nicole Darin precisely as the vulgar cartoon appeared onscreen.

To her credit, Darin remained poised quickly apologetic about the mistake.

CSN Mid-Atlantic, which reaches nearly 5 million viewers, accidentally aired the version from sports blog Deadspin just as anchor Nicole Darin said, 'Clark is a young, friendly bear who can't wait to interact with the kids'

But for around 10 seconds, CSN Mid-Atlantic--which reaches nearly 5 million households--aired NSFW version.

Despite the gaffe and Clark's apparent unpopularity, the Cubs are certain he will eventually be a hit.

Team
 officials say they held focus groups before deciding on Clark, and fans
 told them they wanted a more family-friendly atmosphere at Wrigley 
Field.

Clark will greet fans at Wrigley before and during games, and the mascot will have a Twitter account and Facebook page.

It is safe to assume that, while he will not be wearing pants, neither will the actual Clark mascot be anatomically correct.
