Rush Limbaugh offended many today when he used a rape analogy to explain one of President Obama's current initiatives.

The president is supporting a bill on filibuster reform which would change the required votes to approve judicial and executive nominees from 60 to just 51. 

On his radio show Friday, Limbaugh used rape as a means to explain the bill to listeners.

'Let's forget the Senate for a minute,' Limbaugh said.

He asked viewers to imagine a room with six men and four women. He says that the group has a rule that men cannot rape women. The group also has a rule that requires six votes to change any rule.

'Every not and then, some lunatic in the group proposes to change the rule to allow women to be raped. But they were never able to get six votes for it. There were always the four women voting against it and they always found two guys.

'Well, the guy that kept proposing that women be raped finally got tired of it, and he was in the majority and he was the one that [said], "You know what? We're going to change that rule. Now all we need is five."

The women protest, but the man responds that they have the power to do it, because 'We're the majority'.

'Can the women be raped?' Limbaugh asks. 'Well all it would take then is half of the room. You can change the rule to say three you can change the rule to say three people want it, it's going to happen.'

A negative reaction to Limbaugh's statements immediately started popping up on Twitter from politicians like DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to journalists like the Guardian's Ana Marie Cox.

This isn't the first time the conservative talking head has offended women with his politics.

In 2012, Limbaugh called law student Sandra Fluke a 'slut' and a 'prostitute' after she testified at a hearing about contraception. He later apologized for his statements.

But in response to today's statements, Limbaugh's reps were less than conciliatory.

'Rush Limbaugh has spent 25 years illustrating absurdity by using extrapolated analogies,' a spokesman told the Daily Caller. 'Anyone who calls this anything different than that is simply lying.'
