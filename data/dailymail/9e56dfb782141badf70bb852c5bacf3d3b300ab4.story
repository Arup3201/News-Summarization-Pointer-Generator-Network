An Indiana college freshman has died at a booze-fueled house party after she tumbled down a flight of stairs and suffered a severe head injury - and her friends didn't call an ambulance for seven hours because they thought she was sleeping.

Police at Indiana University in Bloomington say that Rachael Fiege, 19, fell down the basement stairs at an off-campus house and passed out sometime between 1 and 2am on Friday.

Her fellow students helped her up, but did not call an ambulance until nearly 8am - seven hours later, because they didn't realize she was badly injured and thought she had just passed out, police say.

Miss Fiege's tragic death came just two days after she arrived at Indiana University and before she had a chance to even attend her first class. 

Tragic: Rachael Fiege, 19, likely moved to campus on Wednesday and was set to start class today. She was taken off life support Friday afternoon after sustaining a head injury early that morning

Off-campus: This is the house, just a block from the edge of the Indiana University campus, where Miss Fiege fell down a flight of basement stairs and died

The campus newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student, reports that her parents took her off life support Friday afternoon after doctors advised them that she was brain dead. 

She would have started classes today.

Miss Fiege, who hoped to be a nurse, likely moved on campus on Wednesday - the day that the dormitories opened to new students.

Thursday night, she attended a boozy party at a house just one block from the edge of campus. Police say they have not confirmed whether Miss Fiege was drinking at that party.

The coroner's office is awaiting toxicology reports to determine whether she had alcohol in her system.

After she tumbled down the stairs in the basement of the home, students helped her up and had her lay down in a different part of the house about 2am.

Close friends: Miss Fiege's high school soccer teammates traveled to Bloomington for a chance to say goodbye to their friend before she was removed from life support

'The thought initially was probably that the injury was not as serious as it was,' IU Police Chief Laury Flint told the Daily Student.

It was not until 7.45am that Miss Fiege's fellow students realized she would not wake up and called authorities.

No one has been charged in connection with the young student's death.

Miss Fiege was a high school soccer star in her hometown of Zionsville, Indiana, about an hour and a half north of Bloomington.

Her high school teammates traveled from Zionsville and their own colleges across the country on Friday to spend the final few moments with Miss Fiege before doctors removed her from life support.

Her mother Angi Fiege, who is a nurse, learned of her daughter's injury just as she was getting off work at a hospital in Indianapolis.

'It was a nightmare to live on the other side of that. You can never feel the pain of being the parent of a child dying,' she told the Daily Student.
