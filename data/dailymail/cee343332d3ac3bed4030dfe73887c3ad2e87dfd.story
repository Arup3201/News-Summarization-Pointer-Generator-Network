A 24-year-old charged with providing guns to a felon who later used the weapons to savagely kill volunteer firefighters on the morning of Christmas Eve has pleaded not guilty to her alleged crimes.

Dawn Nguyen of Rochester, New York is accused of filing a false business record when she bought two guns later used by ex-convict William Spengler Jr. to kill two firefighters and wound three other first responders to a fire he set in Webster.

Prosecutors said Nguyen indicated on a 
form that a 12-gauge shotgun and AR-15 semiautomatic rifle she bought at
a Gander Mountain store in Henrietta in 2010 were for her, but they 
were really for Spengler, an ex-convict who wasn't allowed to have them.

Accused enabler: Dawn Nguyen, seen arriving at Henrietta Town Court in New York on Tuesday, is accused of illegally supplying two firearms used by a Christmas Eve gunman that killed two volunteer firefighters

Authority: Police say Nguyen, left of one of her attorneys, lied by claiming the two firearms were for her before giving them to 62-year-old ex-convict William Spengler Jr

Plea: Neither Nguyen nor her lawyer spoke to reporters after the brief court appearance in Henrietta Town Court where she pleaded not guilty to her crime

With her state charge of filing a falsified business record, Nguyen faces the same charge in federal court.

Killer: William Spengler had previously served 17 years in prison for killing his elderly grandmother

Neither Nguyen nor her lawyer spoke to reporters after the brief court appearance in Henrietta Town Court on Tuesday.

Nguyen, who previously lived next door to Spengler and called him 'Uncle Billy,' according to her lawyer, had Spengler accompany her to the store where they picked out the deadly weapons.

It was then on Christmas Eve Spengler set his Webster house on fire and shot four volunteer firefighters, killing Michael Chiapperini and Tomasz Kaczowka, as they arrived on the scene. Two other firefighters and a police officer were wounded.

Spengler, 62, who had served 17 years in prison for killing his grandmother with a hammer, then killed himself.

The blaze destroyed seven homes on the narrow stretch of land on Lake Ontario.

'She's very sorry that this individual chose to use the guns 2 1/2 years later in this way and really shocked about what happened,' Nguyen's lawyer John Parrinello said on Monday.

'I hope for her benefit that everybody understands how tangential, if at all, any role she had and how it is totally unrelated to what this maniac did on Christmas Eve,' Parrinello said.

Nguyen, of the Rochester suburb of 
Greece, is free on the condition she not leave Monroe County except to 
attend college classes in a neighboring county.

The gunman also had a .38-caliber revolver in his possession on the day of the shootings, but Nguyen is not connected to that gun. Police used the serial numbers on the weapons to trace them to Nguyen.

'She told the seller of these guns, Gander Mountain in Henrietta, N.Y., that she was to be the true owner and buyer of the guns instead of William Spengler,' U.S. Attorney William Hochul said.

'It is absolutely against federal law to provide any materially false information related to the acquisition of firearms.'

During an interview late on Christmas Eve, Nguyen told police she had bought the guns for personal protection and that they were stolen from her vehicle, though she never reported the guns stolen.

The day after the shootings, however,
Nguyen texted an off-duty Monroe County Sheriff's deputy with 
references to the killings and later admitted to him that she bought the
guns for Spengler.

Police said that information was consistent with a suicide note found near Spengler's body after he killed himself.

The .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle, 
which had a combat-style flash suppressor, is similar to the one Adam 
Lanza used to shoot dead 20 children and six female staff at Sandy Hook 
Elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, earlier this month.

Nguyen and her mother, Dawn Welsher, 
lived next door to Spengler in 2008 - when Nguyen was just 20 years old.

Her brother, Steven Nguyen, told the 
Democrat and Chronicle newspaper of Rochester that Spengler stole the 
guns from Dawn Nguyen.

Spengler set a car on fire and 
touched off an inferno in his Webster home on a strip of land along the 
Lake Ontario shore, took up a sniper's position and opened fire on the 
first firefighters to arrive at about 5:30am on Christmas Eve, 
authorities said. He wounded two other firefighters and an off-duty 
police officer who was on his way to work.

A Webster police officer who had 
accompanied the firefighters shot back at Spengler with a rifle in a 
brief exchange of gunfire before the gunman killed himself.

Spengler spent 17 years in prison for
killing his grandmother in 1980. His neighbors said he confessed his 
criminal past within 15 minutes of them meeting, and even pointed to the
staircase where he committed the crime.

'He said, "I was on drugs and I 
wanted money for drugs and my grandmother wouldn't give it to me,"' Amy 
Warner, who bought the cottage next to Spengler's home with her 
boyfriend this summer, told New York Magazine.

She said they tore out the staircase 
'because it was creepy,' but didn't think twice about buying the house 
because Spengler had served his time. Her home was one of seven destroyed by the fire Spengler started.

Investigators still haven't released the identity of remains found in William Spengler's burned house. They have said they believe the remains are those of his 67-year-old sister, Cheryl Spengler, who also lived in the house near Rochester and has been unaccounted for since the killings.

The Spengler siblings had lived in the home with their mother, Arline Spengler, who died in October. Police found a rambling, typed letter laying out Spengler's intention to destroy his neighborhood and 'do what I like doing best, killing people.'

He had been released from parole in 2006 on the manslaughter conviction, and authorities said they had had no encounters with him since.

Nguyen faces a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, a fine of $250,000 or both.
