A couple have become the country's first husband and wife Bishops.

The appointment of Alison White, 58, as Bishop of Hull means she joins husband Frank, 65, the current acting Bishop of Newcastle, at the top level of the Anglican Church.

Her success in become the country's second only woman Bishop will cause upheaval to the Right Rev Frank White's domestic arrangements.

The couple, who have been married for 33 years and have no children, are moving their family home to the Hull area and Frank will regularly make a 145 mile commute north to Newcastle – staying for much of the week in a 'pied-a-terre.'

Despite serving long careers in the church, Mr and Mrs White have never worked together before.

Although his official title is Assistant Bishop – the Bishop's post in Newcastle is currently vacant – Alison insists she will not outrank her husband when she is consecrated in July.

'I don't think the church works like that in terms of rank,' she said. 'It is extraordinary that we have both had the calling to be Bishops of the church.

'In all this time we have never worked together. Our gifts are quite different and we are different sorts of people.'

The Rev Canon Alison White described the news as 'absolutely wonderful'.

'It's an amazing surprise to me I have to say,' she said. And writing on the diocese website, she said: 'This is an adventure I had never imagined setting out on.' 

Adding: 'You may have noticed that I am married to a Bishop. This may seem excessive! You would think that one in a family is more than enough. Believe me, this has crossed our minds.'

Rev Canon White said having another Bishop in the family gave her no advantage in getting the Bishop of Hull's job. 'The only word he put in for me was with God,' she said.

The appointment was announced following a long interview process, she said.

In January the Rev Libby Lane was consecrated as Bishop of Stockport and became the Church of England's first female bishop.

Rev Canon White said the two women would have a chat before she started in the summer. 

'Won't that be wonderful when, in the best sense, it isn't newsworthy because we're women, it's newsworthy because of what we're called into.'

Her career in the church began when she became a deaconess in 1986 and a priest from 1994. She is currently priest-in-charge of Riding Mill in Northumberland. The new Bishop of Hull was once part of a professional theatre company and is an avid reader and school governor.

Her husband was a social worker for nine years before being ordained in 1980. He said: 'I believe that Alison will be an outstanding bishop and we are delighted at this appointment. 

She combines a deep personal spirituality with clear vision, great energy and a lightness of touch which will serve her very well. She has a great sense of humour and she knows the scale of the task to which God is calling her.'

He added: 'We have always treasured our days off and we'll be making sure that we spend as much time together as possible.'
