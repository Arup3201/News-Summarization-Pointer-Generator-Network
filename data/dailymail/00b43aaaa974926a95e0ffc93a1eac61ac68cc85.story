Ukip is to up the stakes in its controversial anti-immigration campaign for the European elections as the Tories insist only they can give voters a say on Britain’s future in the EU.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage will dismiss criticism by some Labour MPs that its key messages are ‘racist’ - unveiling another provocative poster focusing on migration from the EU.

Featuring an escalator running up the White Cliffs of Dover, it claims the EU’s free movement rules means Britain has ‘no border’ and ‘no control’ over incomers.

Upped the stakes: Ukip's latest poster for the election campaign has taken aim at the controversial change of legislation in January this year which opened Britain's borders to immigrants from Eastern Europe

‘This is in my view the most powerful image of the entire European election campaign. It is designed to bring home to the British public just what membership of the EU means as regards controlling our own borders,’ the Ukip leader said.

‘The White Cliffs of Dover have always been seen as symbolic of Britain’s island status. That status should give us added ability to pick and choose the people who come to live and work in our country. But under EU free movement laws we have no serious control whatever.

‘No doubt the political establishment will react again in mock outrage and throw a new round of slurs and smears at UKIP and at me.

'We’ve been called every name under the sun in recent weeks. But we will not be silenced, and we know that millions of decent British people are on our side and are grateful that we are speaking out.’

Paul Sykes, a millionaire Yorkshire businessman is funding a £1.5 million publicity campaign for Ukip in the European elections, said: ‘This poster goes to the heart of the European debate.

Nigel Farage claims the image is the most powerful yet in the European debate ahead of the May 22 vote

'Over the past 20 years or more, politicians - Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat - have conspired to hide the truth about EU immigration from the British public.

‘They have taken down our borders and handed over control of who who enters the UK to the Eurocrats in Brussels.’

David Cameron will use his local election campaign launch, taking place today in the West Midlands, to make a direct attack on Ukip -- warning voters that backing the upstart party will reduce their chances of having a say in a referendum.

The Conservatives will unveil their own poster, showing a referendum ballot-box marked ‘Europe: You Decide’ alongside the words: ‘An In-Out Referendum on Europe. Labour and the Lib Dems won’t. Ukip can’t. We will in 2017.’

Seeking to address scepticism over his pledge, Mr Cameron will say: ‘To those people who say you won’t deliver that renegotiation or referendum, I say: Judge me by my record as prime minister.

‘Others talk about acting in the national interest or standing up to Europe, I do it, time and again - often In the teeth of opposition in Brussels and with a backdrop of uncertainty about whether it can really happen at home.

‘People said I would never veto a European treaty. In 2011 that’s exactly what I did. People said my attempts to cut the European budget would fail. But I secured that cut.

‘People said I couldn’t get Britain out of the eurozone bailout scheme which Labour got us into, but I did just that. And now, we’re not liable to pay for any Eurozone country that needs a bail-out.

‘So I have a track record of delivery - and I believe me, whatever it takes, I will deliver this in-out referendum. Labour won’t. UKIP can’t. I will. 

David Cameron's approach to the issue is a 'You Decide' campaign. Ed Miliband's party has attacked Ukip's 'xenophobia' and 'lies'

‘I would not be Prime Minister of a government unless we could carry out our pledge of an in-out referendum. Because the British people deserve their say. And I will make sure they get it.’

Labour’s former European Parliament leader said voters considering backing Ukip needed to be ‘educated’ about its ‘lies’ and ‘xenophobia’.

Glyn Ford said Mr Farage was ‘not the worst’ person in Ukip and had some ‘nasty people trailing behind him’.

‘We haven’t educated people as to what they are all about - Ukip voters need to be educated,’ he added.
