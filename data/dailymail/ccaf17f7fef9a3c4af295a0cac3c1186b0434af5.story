Jobless Stuart Worvell, 22, is accused of murder and attempted murder

A naked man wrapped only in a towel murdered a passer-by who disturbed his bath-time, a court heard today.

Stuart Worvell, 22, was listening to loud music in the bathtub at about 9pm when he heard a series of loud knocks on his front door.

Passer-by Thomas Sutton, 20, heard the bath-time music and thought there was a party going on in Worvell's house.

The court heard Worvell went down wearing nothing but the towel then allegedly flew into rage before stabbing Sutton nine times.

Prosecutor Gregg Taylor QC said: 'Thomas heard loud music coming from the end terrace house and thought there might be a party going on.

'He decided to stop, knock the door and try his luck.

'There was no party going on - Stuart Worvell was in his house on his own, he was in the bath with the music up loud so he could hear it from the other room.

'He got out of the bath, went to the bedroom window and said there was no party.

'Thomas kept knocking the door and asking to come in, Worvell didn't want to let him in and things got a bit heated.'

The murder trial jury heard how Worvell confronted Thomas on the doorstep of the house on Maesteg, South Wales, in June of last year and was trying to get admittance to what he thought was a party.

Worvell is then alleged to have grabbed a 15cm kitchen knife and stabbed him repeatedly.

Mr Taylor added: 'He grabbed the biggest knife he could from the cutlery drawer in the kitchen and stabbed him twice.

'The first blow was to the left hand side of the neck severing the main artery between the heart and the brain.

'The second was a wound to the left side of the chest which went deep into his lung.

'Worvell continued to stab his victim, twice to the top of the head and five times to the back.

'These were deep blows and he deliberately stuck in the full extent of the blade.'

Worvell is charged with murdering Thomas Sutton, 20, of Caerau, and attempting to murder 17-year-old Kyle Harris, also of Caerau,

Worvell is also accused of stabbing Thomas' friend Kyle Harris, 18, who tried to intervene to save his best friend.

Mr Taylor said: 'He was stabbed three times and survived only because he received very quick and good emergency surgery without which he would have died as well.'

Thomas, a trainee groundsman, was rushed to hospital but declared dead on arrival.

The court heard how after the attack Worvell - also known as Womble - got dressed and fled the scene shortly after the 9pm killing.

He travelled to Cardiff where he stayed overnight. He then caught a train to Manchester but got off in Dorrington, Shropshire, and handed himself in.

Jobless Worvell denies murder and attempted murder.

He claims he acted in self-defence after Thomas and Kyle, both of Caerau, Maesteg, attempted to attack him with pieces of wood.

Mr Taylor said: 'He claims he did what he did because he thought he was going to be attacked.

'He claimed they had pieces of wood and he thought he would have been killed so he grabbed the biggest knife he could.

'The use of such force was wholly unnecessary.

'Even though the victims had no real reason to be there they were just trying their luck, thinking they might get admittance to a party.'

The trial at Cardiff Crown Court continues.
