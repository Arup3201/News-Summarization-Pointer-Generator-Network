After a busy day it’s all too easy to eat your dinner in front of the TV rather than making the effort to have a traditional family meal.

In fact, six out of ten meals consumed in British homes are eaten while watching television, according to a study.

And more than one third of us regularly eat meals in front of the TV without making any conversation, researchers found.

The survey, which highlights the extent to which millions have abandoned the dining table, discovered that the average person eats 13 meals at home each week, and at least eight of these – around 60 per cent – are eaten while watching television.

Eight in ten think the television is now a big part of modern meal times.

Six in ten are convinced that eating in front of the TV is a growing trend and admit they have done this a lot more in the last five years.

But 45 per cent don’t enjoy the food they’re eating, and many opt for ready meals and takeaways.

More than a third say it’s quite common for them to eat a meal on the sofa and not appreciate their food or notice the flavour.

While 57 per cent of those surveyed would prefer to eat away from the TV more than they do, they admit this never becomes a reality.

A guilt-ridden one in six has even lied to family, friends or colleagues about the how often they eat in front of their television.

Four in ten parents said that, given the chance, their child would eat every meal while glued to the television.

The research was commissioned by Red Tractor beef and lamb, a logo scheme designed to assure shoppers about the quality and traceability of the beef and lamb they are buying.

Jane Ritchie-Smith, from Red Tractor beef and lamb, said: ‘We know we should try to eat our evening meal at the table chatting to family and friends about our day, but the reality is that, after a long day at work, many people just want to sit down and relax in front of the TV.

‘Although there’s nothing wrong with the odd TV dinner, it’s worrying that so many people aren’t enjoying the food they’re eating.’

Red Tractor is launching a campaign – Highly Desirable TV Dinners – to help make the meals more appetising. The step-by-step recipe videos are available online.

Actress and mother Angela Griffin, who is supporting the campaign, said: ‘When I was younger, we always ate dinner at the table and we still try to do this as much as we can.

‘But, sometimes, there’s nothing wrong with catching up on your favourite soap whilst eating your evening meal.’
