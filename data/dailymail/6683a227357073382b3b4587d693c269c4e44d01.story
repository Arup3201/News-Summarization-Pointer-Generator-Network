Fresh from signing a new contract that will keep him at the Etihad Stadium until 2019, Joe Hart was treated to an early Christmas gift from the Manchester City staff.

CityTV's Les Chapman braved the inclement Manchester weather to gift wrap the England goalkeeper's car in the club's car park.

Hart, to his credit, took the prank in his stride after discovering his wrapped up vehicle while also being presented with a 'Number 1' number plate.

The 27-year-old, who joined the club from Shrewsbury in 2006, is certainly City's 'Number 1' after seeing off the challenge of Willy Caballero from Malaga, who signed for the club in the summer.

Hart's side welcome Crystal Palace to the Etihad on Saturday afternoon as Manuel Pellegrini's men look to keep up the pressure on Premier League leaders Chelsea.
