Joan Rivers's daughter has filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the New York-based endoscopy clinic where the beloved comedian fell into a coma just days before her death, it  today emerged.

In a statement, Melissa Rivers's lawyer announced she is suing Yorkville Endoscopy in Manhattan, where her mother suffered a fatal complication during routine throat surgery on August 28, 2014.

The 47-year-old TV producer is also suing the doctors who treated Rivers prior to her death aged 81 on September 4, claiming their 'negligence' and 'carelessness' triggered the star's fatal coma.

She explained that the lawsuit stems from her 'unwavering belief' that no-one should have to suffer the high levels of 'medical mismanagement, incompetency and disrespect' that her mother did.

'Not only did my mother deserve better, every patient deserves better,' said Melissa.

Lawsuit: Joan Rivers's daughter Melissa (pictured with her mother in 2005) has filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the New York-based endoscopy clinic where the comedian fell into a coma before her death

Rivers, who rose to fame on The Tonight Show, died of brain damage due to lack of oxygen after she stopped breathing during what was meant to be a simple endoscopy and throat exam at the clinic.

In the lawsuit, her daughter alleges that doctors did not only carry out those procedures, but also conducted an unauthorized exam of her vocal chords and windpipe, leading to a laryngospasm. 

During the spasm, Rivers's throat seized up and deprived her brain of oxygen so she could not expel carbon dioxide from her lungs, the suit, filed in Manhattan Supreme Court on Monday, states.

But despite the star's vital signs showing clear symptoms of distress, doctors decided to continue with the laryngoscopy, causing Rivers to ultimately suffer a heart attack and brain damage, it adds.

The suit goes on to claim that although doctors tried to revive the comedian for around 20 minutes, no-one performed a trachetomy to open up her airways, the New York Daily News reported. 

'Had doctors acted as physicians for Joan Rivers instead of groupies, Joan Rivers would have been doing ‘Fashion Police’ last week,' one family lawyer, Jeffrey Bloom, told the newspaper. 

Instead, Rivers was rushed to nearby Mout Sinai hospital in a coma, where she was put on life support. However, she never regained consciousness and passed away a week later,

The complaint names five doctors - as well as the clinic on East 93rd Street - as defendants.

Accused: One of the doctors the suit refers to is River's private doctor, ENT specialist Gwen Korovin (right), who 'was permitted to do an unauthorized biopsy on Rivers by medical director, Lawrence Cohen (left)'

One of the doctors it refers to is River's private doctor, celebrity ENT specialist Gwen Korovin, who was 'permitted to do the unauthorized biopsy by the clinic's medical director, Lawrence Cohen'.

At the time, Korovin wasn't cleared to work at the clinic, it states, adding that Cohen 'failed to mention' the procedures carried out by by the doctor and even the fact that she was in the room. 

Experts told the Post that Melissa could win millions of dollars in the suit because her mother was still making good money from stand-up gigs, books and TV shows in the weeks before her death.

Indeed, the comedian performed at a Manhattan club the night before she fell into a coma. She had arranged the throat procedure because her voice had turned raspy and she did not know the cause.

The lawsuit comes just two weeks after it was revealed that Yorkville Endoscopy has lost its federal accreditation and will stop receiving funds at the end of January.

In a letter sent to the clinic, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told the clinic it no longer meets their conditions for coverage after failing to identify Rivers's deteriorating vital signs.

'Therefore, CMS is terminating the Medicare Health Benefits Agreement between Yorkville Endoscopy and the Secretary, effective January 31, 2015,' it said on January 12.

'As of January 31, 2015 Yorkville Endoscopy will no longer be eligible to receive federal funds for services provided to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.'

Despite those losses, the clinic later issued a statement  indicating its intention to remain viable.

'Yorkville Endoscopy LLC does not intend to cease operations. Yorkville is hoping to cooperate with regulators to have the recent decision reversed or modified,' the clinic told ABC News.

Yorkville Endoscopy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from AP.
