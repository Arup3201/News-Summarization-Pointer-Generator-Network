British pupils spend far less time learning core subjects like the 3Rs and science than their counterparts in other Western nations, the study revealed.

Secondary school pupils in the UK spend less than half their time on reading, writing, literature, mathematics, science and foreign languages - one of the few countries to structure the school day like this.

But in countries like France and Ireland, students spend approaching 60 per cent of their time on such key subjects.

British schools do not spend enough time on core subjects like the 3Rs: reading, writing and arithmetic

Critics will say British pupils are being held back by our national curriculum which focuses on non-core subjects such as citizenship and sex and relationships education.

They will argue that students should be spending more time on key subjects which could help them in the global workplace.

The OECD report found that British pupils spend just 46 per cent on ‘core subjects’ - mathematics, science, modern languages and reading, writing and literature.

By contrast, French pupils spend 57 per cent of their time on these subjects, while in Germany they spend 54 per cent of their time and in Ireland 56 per cent.

Across the OECD, the average proportion of time spent on such subjects is 55 per cent.

English pupils instead spend a massive 14 per cent of their time on ‘social studies’, including citizenship classes and sex education, as well as history and geography.

This is exceeded only by two countries - Ireland and Mexico. French pupils spend just 11 per cent of their time on social studies.

English students also spend more time on technology and the arts than their counterparts across the rest of the OECD bloc.
