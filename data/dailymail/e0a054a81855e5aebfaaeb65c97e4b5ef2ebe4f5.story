This is the 'death trap hotel' which hosted more than 90 guests a night before it was forced to shut down.

With caved-in ceilings, no water supply in half the building, and just a single pole holding up the roof, New Kimberley Hotel in Blackpool, Lancashire, was branded a hovel of 'jeopardy' by horrified fire safety officers who raided the building last year.

Twenty smoke alarms were found to be disabled and fire exits were chained shut.

'Jeopardy': The roof of New Kimberley Hotel, Blackpool, was held up by a single pole, fire officers discovered

More than 90 guests a night stayed in the hotel before it was forced shut. Inspectors found caved-in ceilings

The bedrooms were strewn with plastering, and there was no water supply in half the building

Today, owner Peter Metcalf, 51, has been found guilty of 15 fire safety breaches at the property, which was closed after the raid in March last year.

Mark Cairns, fire safety enforcement team
 leader for Lancashire Fire and Rescue, said: 'The consequences of the 
inadequate fire safety measures and inadequate management could have led
 to serious injury or loss of life and circumstances left us no option 
but to take this action.'

Mr Metcalf, who hosted BNP conferences at the hotel, was handed a 12-week prison sentence suspended for 18 months in 2010 after admitting 13 food hygiene charges.

On that occasion, environmental health officers found the kitchen smothered in mould, with out-of-date food left strewn across the top.

Alex Bracken, Blackpool Council’s housing enforcement manager, who was among those inspecting the property, said after the raid last year: 'I would say it was a deathtrap.

Fire safety officers raided the hotel in March 2013, three years after it was found to breach flood safety rules

Fire officers blasted the conditions of the property after they discovered fire exits were chained shut

This is one of the 20 smoke alarms that were disabled and left dangling from the ceiling while guests stayed

'If a fire had broken out, which is highly likely given the conditions in the hotel, it would have actually put the fire team in jeopardy.

'The electricity was connected by illegal means and there were some big fire exit blockages and some doors were nailed shut.'

Councillor Gillian Campbell, Blackpool Council cabinet member for housing, said: 'The New Kimberley Hotel has been a concern to our public protection team for a number of years.

Owner Peter Metcalf, 51, being confronted during the raid. Today he was found guilty of 15 safety breaches

'It’s been one of the most problematic properties we’ve had to deal with and, as a result, we are extremely pleased with the outcome of the case.

'Fire safety is no laughing matter and property owners who fail to make their premises secure are putting lives at risk.

'We have worked together with Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service throughout and together we will continue to tackle landlords who fail in their obligations.'

Metcalf is due back in court to be sentenced on June 11.
