A convicted fraudster and old friend of the Mayor of London has boasted how he flew 6,000 miles to London to assault a journalist who insulted his wife.

Darius Guppy, 49, who has known Boris Johnson since they were students together at Eton and then Oxford, was so enraged by a newspaper article about him that he believed 'humiliated' his wife, Sunderland-born Patricia, he flew from his home in Cape Town to exact revenge.

Notoriously vengeful Guppy, who served time in prison for faking a jewel heist, tracked the journalist down to his home, lay in wait for him and then knocked him to the ground as he left the house before tipping a sack of horse manure over him.

In an article boasting about his attack on the man, Guppy - a former friend and Oxford peer of both Boris Johnson and Earl Spencer, wrote: 'I waited for him to emerge from his house, chased him, and then, having knocked him to the ground, emptied over his head a sack of horse manure rendered slurry by the addition of bottled water - a concoction made possible courtesy of Hyde Park Riding School and the springs of Evian.

'The aim had been not to hurt him but to humiliate him as he had sought to humiliate my wife.

'And humiliate him is exactly what I did, in front of his neighbours who had poured out on to the street at the sound of his screams.'

Writing in the New Statesman, Guppy said he had two friends with him filming the entire incident, but he says he chose not to put the footage onto the internet as he did not wish to hurt the journalist's family.

His article, entitled Who Will Bully The Bullies? names neither the journalist nor the article that upset him, although earlier this year an article appeared in a broadsheet newspaper that cast an aspersion on Mrs Guppy's past.

Boris Johnson has said of his old friend that he lives by 'the Homeric code of honour, loyalty and revenge'.

In a recent BBC interview with Eddie Mair, the London mayor denied tracking down a tabloid journalist 20 years ago whom Guppy wanted beaten up over probings into him for an article.

The affair that the journalist, Stuart Collier, was looking into was the fraud that resulted - eventually - in Guppy going to jail.

Angry with insurers Lloyd's of London after his father lost his home and money in the 1990s financial crisis, Guppy and his fellow Oxford graduate Ben Marsh hired a stooge to tie them up in their room at the Halloran House Hotel in New York and shoot a mattress.

When police arrived they convinced them they had been the subject of a jewel heist - Guppy 'sobbing like a baby' for effect.

Lloyd's paid up for the 'stolen' jewels within weeks, but the stooge, Peter Risdon, was angry at the small sum he had been paid for his part in the fraud.  Collier started looking into the incident, and Guppy got wind of it.

Risdon recorded a conversation between Guppy and Boris Johnson in which they discussed finding the journalist and Guppy said: 'There is nothing I won't do to get my revenge'.

In 1993 Guppy was jailed for five years and ordered to pay a £533,000 fine.  Guppy said he had no money and declared himself bankrupt, and was ordered to stay in jail until the fine was paid.

But a mystery benefactor lent him £165,000 to get him out jail - a man many suspected was his old friend Charles Spencer.  Guppy was freed in 1996 and moved first to Ireland and then to South Africa.

Guppy still lives in South Africa with his wife, with whom he has three children, but has fallen out with his old friend Charles Spencer over unfounded suggestions the latter had tried to seduce his wife.

Today there were calls on Twitter for Guppy to be arrested over the alleged assault, but a Met Police spokesman told MailOnline they had not been asked to investigate any such incident.
