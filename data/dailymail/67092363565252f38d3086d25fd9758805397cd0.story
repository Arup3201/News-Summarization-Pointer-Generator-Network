An exhibit celebrating the seventieth anniversary of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s The Little Prince has opened at New York City’s Morgan Library & Museum.

‘The Little Price: A New York Story’ displays more than 40 of the French author’s original illustrations from the famous children’s story, which is the most-read French-language book in history.

The Morgan acquired the author's works in 1968 from their original owner, Silvia Hamilton – who was a close friend of Mr Saint-Exupéry during his time spent writing the book in New York.

Then and now: The Morgan Library has displayed Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's early sketches beside those that ultimately made it into The Little Prince

Home sweet home: The Little Prince's most famous image (one which is often used as the book's cover) features the title character standing on his home planet, known as Asteroid B-612

The Little Prince, or Le Petit Prince as it is titled in French, has been translated in more than 250 languages since its 1943 release.

It is a semi-autobiographical story written from the vantage point of an unnamed narrator, who crashes his plane into the Sahara and meets a ‘little prince’ who hails from a small planet where he lives in solitude.

The two embark on an endearing relationship where the prince recounts his visits through outer space over the course of eight trialing days. After nearly dying of dehydration, and then finding water with the help of the prince, the narrator reluctantly bids his friend adieu – unable to find him again, likely at the cause of his own hallucinations.

The book has been praised as a classic for its sage passages that provide valuable advice to both children and adults alike.

While the tale’s Leon-born author and
 original language are undeniably French, it may come as a surprise to 
many to hear that The Little Prince is actually an American-grown work.

It reflects Mr Saint-Exupéry’s emotional
 two-year stay in the United States during the Second World War by 
drawing on an outsider’s experiences – carefully employing the 
expressions of despair, loneliness, and triumph throughout its plotline.

As The Morgan Library’s director William M. Griswold said in a release: ‘The exhibition allows us to step back to the moment of creation and witness Saint-Exupéry at work right here in New York.

‘One discovers the author-aviary struggling with the enormity of events impacting his native France and the world at large, while finding the focus to complete a tale as magical today as it was seventy years ago.’

Hailing from an aristocratic family, 
Mr Saint-Exupéry had enjoyed a successful career as a commercial and 
army pilot prior to his American visit. Upon Germany’s upheaval of the 
French government, though, he lost his position within the French Air 
Force.

During his stay in New York, Mr Saint-Exupéry lived with his wife Consuelo on Central Park South, and later on Beekman Place.

He would often write in assorted 
locations around the city, including the residence of his friend Silvia 
Halmilton, whose black poodle served as the visual inspiration for The 
Little Prince’s reoccurring sheep character.

Upon
 his invitation to join the Allied forces as a pilot in 1943, Mr 
Saint-Exupéry decamped New York City just as The Little Prince began to 
hit store shelves.

But before leaving, he unexpectedly appeared at Ms Hamilton’s door and gifted her the book’s original manuscripts and drawings. The Morgan Library purchased the full lot in 1968.

It is the only handwritten draft of The Little Prince known to exist today, as Mr Saint-Exupéry died in 1944 (at the age of 44) while on a observational military flight in the South of France - only weeks before the liberation of Paris.

The Morgan Library, founded in 1906 to house J.P. Morgan’s private collection of books, has displayed Mr Saint-Exupéry’s original sketches beside the illustrations that ultimately made it into his consummate literary contribution.

In doing so, the Morgan has shown how
 one of the world’s most famous stories came to fruition, on both 
textual and visual fronts.

Practice runs: Mr Saint-Exupéry's sketches often display coffee stains and cigarette burns, which allude to the lifestyle he maintained while writing his famous book

But
 even more interesting is how the Morgan Library’s manuscripts show the 
intensive methods that Mr Saint-Exupéry took to develop his 
golden-haired prince’s precocious personality.

Original notes written by the author show a detailed analysis of the Prince’s would-be vegetarian diet, outlining how his self-tended garden included radishes, tomatoes, beans and potatoes, but not fruit, as their corresponding trees would prove too large for the protagonist’s small, house-sized planet.

Similarly discarded scratchpad stages of The Little Prince’s creation include one of the Morgan Library’s most valued sketches by Mr Saint-Exupéry – an image showing the little prince wearing a yellow scarf and floating above earth, which had clearly been crumpled and thrown in the trash before being rescued, and later flattened out.

Other treasures include the only copy of The Little Prince that Mr Saint-Exupéry is said to have gifted to a child.

The author’s military ID bracelet, which was discovered by a French fisherman in 1998, has also been put on display.

The Little Prince: A New York Story will remain open to the public at the Morgan Library & Museum through April 27.
