Film critic Barry Norman has dismissed Sunday night's Oscars ceremony as 'little better than a crapshoot', and claimed Hollywood judges let their maids vote for them.

Several British names, including Eddie Redmayne, Benedict Cumberbatch, Felicity Jones, Rosamund Pike and Keira Knightley, are in the running for Sunday's Academy Awards.

But the veteran broadcaster, who presented the BBC's Film programme for 26 years, said the voting system is unfair - and that being nominated is just as worthy as taking home the famous statuette.

Film critic Barry Norman (right) has dismissed Sunday night's Oscars ceremony as 'little better than a crapshoot', and predicts Michael Keaton (left) will win best actor for Birdman because he is 'local'

'It always seems to me that the Oscars are much more interesting at the nominations stage than in the final analysis', the 81-year-old told Radio Times magazine.

'Apart from best picture, for which everyone votes, all the nominees are chosen by their peers - actors by other actors, directors by other directors and so on. 

'If people who were probably vying with you for the same job think you did some of the best work of the year, that's a true compliment.'

British actor Eddie Redmayne has been hotly tipped to take home an Oscar for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything

Another Brit, Benedict Cumberbatch has been nominated for his role in The Imitation Game, where he played codebreaker Alan Turing

Norman predicted that Birdman actor Michael Keaton was more likely than The Theory Of Everything star Redmayne to scoop the best actor Oscar, simply because the 63-year-old is 'a local boy ... who has never won a major award'. 

'Just being nominated for an Oscar is a victory in itself,' he said.

'It's only when it comes to picking the winners that everyone votes in every category and the whole thing becomes little better than a crapshoot.'

British actress Rosamund Pike is also in the running for Best Actress, thanks to her role opposite Ben Affleck in Gone Girl (pictured)

Both Felicity Jones and Redmayne have been nominated for their parts in The Theory Of Everything, which has also been nominated for Best Picture

Both Keira Knightley and Cumberbatch have been nominated for The Imitation Game

And Norman questioned whether members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences entitled to vote for the prestigious awards have even seen all of the films vying for the prizes.

'Personal likes and dislikes come into play. You might vote for someone simply because he or she was nice to you on the set,' he said.

'Then there's the question of whether all the voters actually saw all the films. It's not unknown for some, especially the elderly, to get their maids to watch them on DVD and deliver their opinions.'

American Sniper, in which Bradley Cooper plays Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, is also among those nominated for Best Picture

The Grand Budapest Hotel is also up for the biggest prize on Oscar night, with the 87th Acadamy Awards ceremony taking place on Sunday
