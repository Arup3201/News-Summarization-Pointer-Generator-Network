On the booze: A dishevelled Gazza openly carries a bottle of gin in the street before his collapse

Looking dazed and occasionally breaking into tears, a frail Paul Gascoigne is led to an ambulance after being found wandering the streets clutching a four-pack of lager and a bottle of gin.

The former World Cup hero’s latest downward spiral ended in a hospital near his home in the expensive Sandbanks area of Poole, Dorset, where he woke up yesterday after once more falling spectacularly off the wagon. In the most shocking chapter yet of his long and often very public battle with alcoholism, onlookers had dialled 999 after finding him slumped tearfully against a wall with his head in his hands at around 2.30pm on Thursday.

Shortly before the ambulance had whisked him away, at 3.05pm, the former England star was seen calling a friend to plead: ‘I’m in trouble, please can you come and help me?’

Gascoigne, who looks far, far older than his 47 years, was believed last night to be in Poole Hospital.

He had been observed drinking in public on several occasions in preceding days, and at lunchtime on Tuesday was videoed by a passer-by in what appeared to be an inebriated state, in central Bournemouth.

‘You could smell the booze on him. He was hanging on me to stay up. He was absolutely battered,’ said an onlooker. When he was taken into care 48 hours later, he appeared to still be wearing the same T-shirt.

On his feet were a pair of blue slippers, which he’d worn to walk to an off-licence, where he’d purchased the alcohol and a packet of cigarettes.

Gascoigne, who only months ago flexed his biceps while posing for pictures after a visit to the gym, looked weak and malnourished. His hair was unwashed, his skin blotchy, and he seemed barely able to open his eyes.

Markedly pale, a gold cross hanging from his neck and tattoos showing on his right arm, he seemed a mere shadow of the man he was even a year or two ago. Comparisons with his athletic physique in his prime are even more shocking. The once muscular legs are painfully thin (there is a small wound on his left shin). The arms that once helped to force him past defenders are now wasted.

Compounding his misery, he is feared to be facing homelessness after being told that he must leave his £3 million rented penthouse apartment in the coming weeks.

‘His lease will run out on September 13, and the landlord will not be renewing the contract as he wants the flat back,’ says Christopher Eales, the director of the management firm which runs the exclusive property overlooking Poole Harbour.

Neighbours are said to have made many complaints about noise from the flat, where Gascoigne lives alone.

The former Spurs and Lazio star’s sister Lindsay said on Facebook yesterday: ‘This illness is so tragic, and there is no cure, and [it] has shown its ugly head again. So in among my heartbreak . . . please leave us alone to grieve and pull together as a family as always to help save a great man.’

But, of course, we’ve been here plenty of times before.

Gascoigne was first packed off to rehab 
by Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson in 1998, having been found 
unconscious after drinking 32 shots of whisky. His life since has been 
an ongoing struggle with drink, drugs and mental health issues.

For the past four years, Gascoigne has been living in Poole, where he is an occasional patient at nearby Bournemouth’s rehabilitation centre, The Providence Project. But in between stays there, his condition has appeared to spiral out of control.

Months ago, he had to leave another rented apartment in Sandbanks after a series of disturbances.

Friends have frequently attempted to rally round. Last year, his former team-mate Gary Lineker clubbed together with DJ Chris Evans and ex-England cricketer Ronnie Irani to pay for him to stay at an Arizona clinic.

‘I can honestly say we’ve supported him over the years,’ said Lineker at the Edinburgh TV festival yesterday. ‘Lots of people have — Tottenham have, his friends have. And I just wish him well.’ But, he added, responsibility for any future recovery ‘has ultimately got to come from Paul’.

A close friend says: ‘Paul’s not just an alcoholic. He’s got OCD, ADHD, and Tourette’s Syndrome. He’s bulimic, anorexic, he’s an obsessive exerciser. As long as he had football, the structure of a club and the public adulation, his conditions were manageable. But since his career finished there’s been a hole he really can’t fill.’

Hunter Davies, who co-wrote Gascoigne’s 2004 autobiography, agrees.

‘Football saved Paul from himself. He was ill long before it came along, and for those 20 years, it helped him to manage those illnesses. Drink certainly didn’t ruin his career like it did for George Best. He was still playing in the Premier League in his 30s. He won 57 caps. But when the football ended, things spiralled.

‘He doesn’t even like alcohol. He hates the taste of it,’ adds Davies. ‘I’ve been with him when he’s poured it into flower pots, because he finds it so revolting. But then he will get depressed, and just want to get obliterated.’

Since leaving the game, Gascoigne has made a living on the back of his enduring fame. A friend says: ‘He has always done his best to provide for Sheryl and the children.’ Sheryl, whom he divorced in 1999, is the mother of his son Regan and step-children Bianca and Mason. Bianca yesterday tweeted to well-wishers: ‘Thank you for your kind words.’

In recent months, however, there have been signs that Gascoigne has fallen increasingly upon hard times.

Neighbours yesterday claimed he has even resorted to charging fans to take ‘selfie’ photographs with him on their mobile phones. ‘I’ve seen Gazza ask for a fiver for a selfie from some tourists,’ said one.

Today, more than a decade after quitting football, most of the diminishing circle of people he feels able to trust come from within the game.

One is Harry Redknapp, the QPR manager who lives a corner kick from Gascoigne’s flat. He offered yesterday to give him a coaching role.

‘He could do some coaching with the kids, I would love it if he would.

‘I love Gazza, he has got a heart of gold,’ he added. ‘Everyone has tried to help him, but the only person who can help him now is himself.’
