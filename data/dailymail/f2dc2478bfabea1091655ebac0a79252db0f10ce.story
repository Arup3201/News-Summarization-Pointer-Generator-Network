Two Everton fans have claimed they sneaked into the Premier League game with Stoke City after one of them pretended to be wheelchair-bound in order to gain access to the disabled section of the Britannia Stadium. 

The twisted supporters then bragged about their exploits on Facebook - although admitted that some people would see them as 'scum' for their actions. 

Everton ended up losing the game to Stoke 2-0 and are currently 14th in the league table.  

Cheat: Two football fans claim they sneaked into the Britannia Stadium by pretending to be disabled

Boast: The supporters posted this message on a Facebook football fans' page admitted they were 'scum'

Writing on a Facebook page The Football Bible, one of the fans said: 'Me and my mate decided to go to Stoke away last minute on Wednesday.

'The only spare ticket we could get was in the disabled section though. So he borrowed a wheelchair from work and I went as his carer.

'We're scum aren't we? We're going to hell for what we did in Stoke.'

The Everton Disabled Supporters Association has vowed to investigate the fans' claims - but insisted that they could not have obtained their tickets through the club.

Chairman Steve Heneghan said: 'There's no way they could get it from us. If something did happen, we would throw them out of our membership, and the club would do the same.'

He told MailOnline that disabled tickets to away games were generally reserved for fans who regularly attend matches, making it difficult to manipulate the system.

Mr Heneghan added: 'You have to keep an eye out for fraudsters. In the past, some fans have just turned up in a wheelchair and been let into the ground - there's no way to guard against that.

'There are people in this world who'll do anything to cheat disabled people. If you're desperate enough, evil enough, devious enough to get into a game, then anyone can do it.'

Other disabled fans blasted the stunt at Stoke's Britannia Stadium - Ollie Baskaran wrote on Facebook: 'I'm a wheelchair user and every time I have to book disabled tickets for anywhere, I have to send paperwork etc. just to prove I'm disabled.'

However, some web users praised the fans, comparing them jokingly to the fake wheelchair user, Andy Pipkin, on TV's Little Britain.

Stoke City said the club was aware of the two fans' online boasts, but said it was up to Everton to take action against the men.

A spokesman said: 'We have been made aware of the claims of two Everton fans that they gained access to last week's game at the Britannia Stadium masquerading as a disabled supporter in a wheelchair and carer.

'If their claims prove correct and the people concerned can be identified, it will be for Everton to take action against them as appropriate.'

Everton refused to comment on the men's claims, and would not confirm whether or not the club would launch an investigation.
