Resplendent in beautifully embroidered dove-grey silk and a striking Phillip Treacey fascinator, the Duchess of Cornwall was every inch the royal bride when she married Prince Charles in 2005.

Now the Duchess' stunning Anna Valentine gown is to be the centrepiece of an exhibition opening next month at the V&A. And the Duchess of Cornwall isn't the only aristocratic bride to dust off her nuptial frock for the show.

Also included is the flesh-flashing Pam Hogg frock worn by Lady Mary Charteris to her 2012 marriage to Big Pink frontman, Robbie Furze, and a truly spectacular white silk-satin gown with an 18ft train sported by Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, on her big day in 1933.

Other highlights include the dip-dyed pink and ivory John Galliano-designed dress worn by Gwen Stefani to her 2004 wedding to Gavin Rossdale and the unusual purple silk frock in which Dita von Teese married shock-rocker Marylin Manson.

The gowns will join dresses dating from the 18th and 19th centuries for an exhibition entitled Wedding Dresses 1775 - 2014, which opens on the 3rd May and runs until 15th March next year.

Among the most striking is a ravishing silk brocade gown worn by a wealthy 
woman named Jane Bailey to her 1780 marriage to James Wickham. Equally
 impressive is the lavishly frilled, embroidered and furbelowed dress 
sported by New York heiress Cara Leland Huttleston Rogers at her wedding
 to Bradford Ferris Duff in 1890.

But it's not all pretty dresses with stellar pedigrees. As curator Edwina Ehrman explains, the collection also gives an insight into the changing tastes of British brides over the last 300 years.

'In the 18th century, the most prestigious fabrics for a bride were those woven with expensive gold and silver metal threads,' explains Ehrman. 'This was the choice of most royal brides until Queen Victoria married in white satin in 1840.

'However wearing white was also a status symbol.  In the past white garments were very difficult to keep clean and white was associated with wealth and leisure.'

Although white and similarly pale shades such as ivory and cream remain popular, as the Duchess of Cornwall's dress makes plain, other hues are becoming increasingly fashionable.

Some brides, among them Dita von Teese, choose to dispense with lighter hues altogether, while others such as Gwen Stefani and Jessica Biel opt for subtly coloured gowns.

'We’ve got some excellent examples of 
coloured wedding dresses in the exhibition,' adds Erhman. 'Among them are a purple dress 
made by a lady’s maid in 1899, a floor-length dress made from colourful 
upholstery fabric during World War II and Dita von Teese’s incredible 
purple taffeta gown designed by Vivienne Westwood for her marriage to 
Marylin Manson in 2005.'

But while the coloured dresses are gorgeous, what really catches the eye is the social commentary offered by the rest of the collection; reflecting, as they do, the social upheaval and changing tastes that characterised the 20th century.

'The 20th century witnessed rapid social 
change and increasing economic, political and sexual freedom for women,' explains Erhman. 
'While most women still wanted a degree of formality in their wedding 
dress, the traditional codes of dress gradually lost their power.

Delicate:

Stunning:

'In the
 1960s some women celebrated the new freedoms by marrying in 
mini-dresses and trouser suits and in the 1990s, the plunging, backless, 
strapless wedding dress became accepted even for church weddings.

'The 
etiquette of wedding dress for men also relaxed with more men choosing 
to wear lounge suits and some buying wedding outfits from shops which 
targeted a young and fashion-conscious market.'

Modern
 dresses included in the exhibition show just how much leeway 
contemporary brides have, with everything from dip dye to cutaway 
bodices on display.

'I do love the drama of John Galliano’s 
2002 pink and white dress for Gwen Stefani,' adds Erhman. 'It’s incredibly romantic and
 slightly shocking: the dress has been designed to make it appear as if 
the groom has already tried to start undressing the bride leaving her 
dress in disarray.

'It’s also a glorious colour. The hem of the dress 
and veil are drenched in pink which gradually fades away into white. I 
also love the subtle, sensual elegance of the Ian and Marcel’s pleated 
dress and coat, made for an unknown bride in 1989, which the designers 
paired with veil decorated with roses drawn in silicone rubber.'

From
 frilled and furbelowed to silicone and rubber, the dresses on display 
at the V&A might not be your average bridal gowns, but they are 
certainly fascinating ones.
