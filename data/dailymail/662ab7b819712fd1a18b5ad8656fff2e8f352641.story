Chef Adam Steele, 28, has been fired after he attacked a fellow chef at a party in the Royal Mews, Buckingham Palace

One of the Queen's favourite chefs has been fired after allegedly headbutting another member of the Buckingham Palace staff during a drunken row.

Adam Steele, 28, was popular with the Royal Family and was regularly requested by Prince Philip to cook for his guests.

But he was sacked for the alleged assault on a fellow chef at a party in staff quarters at the Palace. 

Police were called when the fight broke out at the impromptu Friday night gathering in the Royal Mews, which was also attended by footmen, housemaids and other servants.

Onlookers said the trouble erupted after Steele was told he had drunk too much and should quieten down.

Officers arrested him and held him in cells overnight, while the other chef was left with a cut to his head and a black eye, according to Palace sources. 

Steele, an experienced sous-chef, had worked for the Queen for several years and was highly regarded. 

He had been due to travel with Prince Philip to the Sandringham estate in Norfolk this month to cook for guests at one of his regular shooting parties.

But after the incident he was stripped of his Palace pass and dismissed following an internal inquiry by Mark Flanagan, the head of the royal kitchens.

An insider told the Daily Mail: 'Mark wanted to keep him because the tragedy is Adam is a very good chef, and popular with the royals. He has cooked for the Queen at Craigowan Lodge at Balmoral and he is a particular favourite of the Duke of Edinburgh.

'Whenever the duke has his shooting parties at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate, he always asks for Adam.'

The party in the Royal Mews, where many Palace staff have grace and favour homes, was on October 17. The precise details of the fight are unclear, but Steele is said to have headbutted the other chef and punched him in the face.

The insider said: 'No one knows what exactly was said to Adam, but it was something like, 'You've had enough, it's time to stop drinking'.

'Whatever it was, the next thing the other man has blood over his face and a cut eyebrow. It's ironic because they work together and we all thought they were friends.'

The sacking meant that Steele could not cook for the state banquet at Buckingham Palace for Singapore's President Tony Tan Keng Yam a few days later.

The Queen will be disappointed by the incident. She is believed to have met the young chef several times while performing her annual tradition of giving Christmas presents to her staff in person.

Steele told the Daily Mail he was not allowed to comment.

But his mother Gillian, 63, said news of her son's arrest and dismissal had been a shock. At her detached home in Alsager, Cheshire, Mrs Steele said: 'He has been at the Palace a number of years and I knew he was well-liked and popular so I can't understand how this has happened.'

A Scotland Yard spokesman said Steele was charged with assault and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on November 4.

He was bailed to appear again next Tuesday.

Buckingham Palace declined to comment.
