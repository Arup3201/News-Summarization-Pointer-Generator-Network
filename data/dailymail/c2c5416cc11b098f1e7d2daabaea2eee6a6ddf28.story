Lisa Swinton McLaughlin, 56,  gave birth by cesarean section  to sons Jordan and Dylan

A new mom died seven days after giving birth to twins following more than 30 years of longing to have children.

Lisa Swinton McLaughlin, 56, who lived in Baltimore, Maryland, gave birth by cesarean section on December 27 to sons, Jordan and Dylan.

But she died on January 4 from a bowel obstruction - she had been in pain, but thought it was the result of the incision.

Her husband Mike McLaughlin, 67, a retiree, has not only lost his wife, but he must now face raising their two sons alone, reports Omaha.com.

He says Mrs McLaughlin who was medical director for the American Red Cross in Baltimore, Maryland, had longed for children for the past 30 years.

The couple spent a decade trying different types of fertility treatments and were delighted when Mrs McLaughlin became pregnant last year. 

She developed gestational diabetes during the pregnancy, but it was monitored closely by her doctors.

In December she started bed rest because the size of one twin was causing a blood-flow problem.

And on December 27, she gave birth by cesarean section to Jordan, three pounds and three ounces, and Dylan, three pounds.

'She was just on cloud nine,' Mr McLaughlin said.

'That's the happiest I've probably seen her in my life.' 

'She wanted what every other woman had, and that’s children.'

They were premature, but the boys were healthy and thrived in the neonatal intensive care unit. 

Although she was in significant pain, Mrs McLaughlin went home on New Year's Eve - a few days later she died. 

'She held the babies and was able to stroke them and love them,' her husband said.

Mr McLaughlin is hoping the twins will be able to come home soon - they both weigh four pounds.

He has hired a nanny to help take care of them and eventually plans to move home to Nebraska, where his son, other family members and friends can help out.
