A New Jersey canine that was crowned the world's ugliest dog in 2007 and later became the topic of a children's book preaching acceptance has died. Elwood was 8.

His owner, Karen Quigley, says the Chinese crested and Chihuahua mix died unexpectedly Thanksgiving morning. The Sewell resident says Elwood had been dealing with some heath issues in recent months but appeared to be doing well.

Beauty is only skin deep: Chinese Crested and Chihuahua mix dog 'Elwood' won the title of World's ugliest dog of 2007 at the World's Ugliest Dog Contest. He died unexpectedly on Thanksgiving morning

Ugly dog: Elwood was crowned as the world's ugliest dog, a distinction that delighted Karen. Dark and hairless save for a Mohawk-like puff of white fur on his head, is often referred to as Yoda or ET as he looks like those characters

Elwood was dark colored and hairless — save for a puff of white fur resembling a Mohawk on his head. He was often referred to by fans as Yoda, or E.T., for his resemblance to those famous science-fiction characters.

Elwood’s distinctive looks, hairless except for a tuft on his head and a tongue that was permanently out on one side, became an asset when he won his crown at the 2007 ugly dog contest at the Marin-Sonoma County Fair in California a year after he had finished second.

Saved: His owner Karen says she rescued Elwood just as the breeder was about to have him put down, thinking he was too ugly to sell

Little monster: Elwood went from being a homeless howler to a classic ugly dog in 2007. The Ugliest Dog contest lures owners of canine catastrophes from all over America and Europe in the hope that their ugly mutt can land them a $1,000 prize

In early 2013 Quigely said she would “retire” Elwood from public events.

'When this ‘angel’ boy came into my life, he has worked tirelessly on behalf of homeless and abused animals everywhere,' wrote Quigley.

'Elwood has traveled extensively… appearing at over 200 events raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for innumerable rescue groups and non-profit animal organizations.'
