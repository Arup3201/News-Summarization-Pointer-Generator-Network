Michelle Obama has rescheduled a high school graduation speech after the students complained that her appearance would prevent many of their friends and relatives from attending the ceremony.

The First Lady was scheduled to speak at a combined graduation ceremony for five high schools in Topeka, Kansas, on May 17 but will now be speaking at a different 'senior recognition day' ceremony the day before.

'Once we learned about the concerns of some students, we were eager to find a solution that enabled all of the students and their families to celebrate the special day,' said the First Lady's communications director, Maria Cristina Gonzalez Noguera.

Eighteen-year-old Taylor Gifford had launched an online petition urging the school district to reconsider its plans.

Gifford and the more than 1,200 people who had signed it expressed concern that Mrs. Obama's visit would limit guest seating.

Mrs Obama had accepted the district's invitation to speak May 17 at the combined ceremony to mark that day's 60th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, outlawing school segregation. The case originated in Topeka.

Under a new plan worked out by the district, the first lady will speak at the same 8,000-seat arena where the combined ceremony was to be held.

The combined ceremony is being scrapped and the five schools will hold separate graduation exercises instead. Since Mrs. Obama will no longer speak at a graduation, seating would not need to be limited due to concerns over her security.

The pushback from Mrs Obama's graduation speech was not limited to students since parents also feared that her participation would overshadow the students' big day.

'I'm a single mother who has raised him for 18 years by myself,' said Tina Hernandez, parent of Topeka High School senior Dauby Knight.

'I've told him education is the only way out. This is one of the biggest days of their lives. They've taken the glory and shine from the children and put on Mrs. Obama. She doesn't know our kids.'

Hernandez was among the parents and students who spoke at a school board meeting last week and urged district officials to reconsider their decision to invite Obama.

A high school senior started a petition  against Michelle Obama speaking at Topeka High School's graduation and it ended up garnering more than 1,200 signatures

Ron Harbaugh, spokesman for the Topeka school district, said Friday discussions were under way to work out the logistics and planning for the event, including how many tickets each family would be allotted.

Gifford, the student who started the petition, said her initial reaction to the news was excitement, saying she was 'freaking out' about the prospect of the first lady speaking at graduation.

When rumors of limited tickets surfaced, Gifford felt like the focus was being shifted from the students to Obama.

'People think it's a great opportunity, but it's the graduates' time. They are getting that diploma that they worked so hard for,' Gifford said.

'Families are feeling that they are being cheated out of the loved ones special day.'
