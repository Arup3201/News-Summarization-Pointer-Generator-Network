The Duke of Cambridge marked Remembrance Sunday with a deeply personal note dedicated to two of his friends killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.

His touching message was attached to a large poppy wreath he placed at the Cenotaph as he joined the Queen and Prince Harry at the memorial service.

It read: ‘For Jo, Lex and all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.’

Honour: Prince William lays a wreath at the annual Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph

The Duke was referring to Joanna Dyer, a 2nd lieutenant who trained alongside him, and Major Alexis Roberts, who was his platoon commander and mentor at Sandhurst.

Major Roberts was killed in October 2007 when his armoured vehicle hit an improvised explosive device in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.

The married father-of-two, 32, who was serving with the 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles, had been in charge of a 30-vehicle convoy negotiating a road nicknamed ‘IED alley’ when his Vector armed vehicle exploded.

At the time, the Duke issued a tribute saying he was ‘deeply saddened’ by the death of his ‘good friend’.

Lieutenant Dyer, 24, of the Intelligence Corps, was also killed when her convoy was hit by an explosion. Her Warrior vehicle was destroyed by a ‘colossal’ bomb in Basra, Iraq, in April 2007.

Three other soldiers, Corporal Kris O’Neill, 27, Private Eleanor Dlugosz, 19, and Kingsman Adam Smith, 19, were also killed, as well as a civilian interpreter.

The Duke said he was ‘absolutely devastated’ at the news of Lieutenant Dyer’s death, describing her as a ‘close friend’. They had passed out in the same company at Sandhurst the previous December.

William invited Holly Dyer, Lieutenant Dyer’s sister, and Susie Roberts, Major Roberts’s widow, to his wedding to Kate Middleton in April 2011 in honour of his two friends.

The Duke wore the uniform of an RAF Flight Lieutenant yesterday. He served as a search and rescue helicopter pilot in the RAF for three years. In September, he announced he was leaving the Armed Forces to focus on Royal duties and  charity work.

Respect: Prince Edward also wrote his own personal message to those who had fallen
