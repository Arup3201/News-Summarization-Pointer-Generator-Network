West Ham are weighing up making a move for Everton defender Sylvain Distin.

They are desperate for a centre-back and the 37-year-old Frenchman can leave Everton on a free transfer.

A short-term deal until the end of the Barclays Premier League season is likely, although he may push for an 18-month contract.

Distin's last appearance in the Premier League was against Newcastle in a 3-2 defeat at St James' Park on December 28, before taking part in their 1-1 draw against West Ham in the FA Cup on January 6.
