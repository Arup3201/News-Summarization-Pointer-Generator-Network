Ray Rice is not only fighting to get back into the NFL - but he's also demanding his $3.5million salary from the Baltimore Ravens. 

The team fired Rice last month after a video surfaced showing him punching now-wife Janay Palmer unconscious in an Atlantic City hotel elevator.

In a recently filed formal grievance, the former Ravens running back cites at article in the league's collective bargaining agreement which says players can not be punished more than once for a single rule violation.  

Ray Rice has filed a formal grievance with the Baltimore Ravens, demanding his $3.5million salary after the team fired him last month 

The former running back was fired from the team after video was released, showing the moment he punched his then-girlfriend and now-wife Janay Palmer unconscious 

Rice doesn't deny that he violated the NFL's domestic violence policy, but says punishment for that rule break is only a two-game suspension without pay. Instead, the team fired Rice on September 9 for the video and it's been six games since he's worn a purple jersey. 

'I do think he has a good, solid argument,' said Kraig Long, Tydings & Rosenberg LLP told CBS Baltimore.  

Exiled Rice has a separate complaint with the league filed through the NFL Players Union,arguing that his indefinite suspension should be lifted due to the same two-game rule. 

Legal experts say Rice has a good case for winning both grievances, and if he wins either one he's expected to get his $3.5million of his  base salary for the year. If he loses both he will not be paid any more of the contract the five-year contract he signed in 2012 for $35million.

The appeal hearing on the reinstatement issue has been set for November 5 and 6, sources told the Baltimore Sun. 

It was also revealed on Thursday that   NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has been told to testify in Rice's appeal of his indefinite suspension, a person familiar with the case said  Wednesday night.

Former U.S. District Judge Barbara S. Jones, the neutral arbiter selected to hear the appeal, informed the parties of her decision Wednesday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the appeal have not been made public.

It was uncertain whether Goodell will actually testify. He said this month he would leave the decision to Judge Jones.

'We will continue to respect Judge Jones' confidentiality order regarding this proceeding,' NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said in an email.

NFL lawyers have argued that Goodell shouldn't have to testify, and instead were offering testimony from Jeff Pash, the NFL's general counsel, and Adolpho Birch, the NFL's vice president for labor policy. Pash and Birch were with Goodell when he met with Rice's side in June to talk about what happened when the former Pro Bowl running back hit his then-fiancee in an elevator. 

It has also been revealed this week at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell could be forced to speak at an appeal on Rice's indefinite suspension
