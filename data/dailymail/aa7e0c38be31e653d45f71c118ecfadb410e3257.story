A multi-millionaire lottery winner who was forced to close his music shop has decided to relaunch the business online.

Adrian Bayford, who became one of Britain's biggest ever jackpot winners when he landed £148million in the Euromillions last year, had hoped to keep his instrument shop open despite his newfound wealth.

But after closing the shop because of people constantly coming in and asking for money, he is set to convert part of his home into a workshop to support a new web-based business.

Mr Bayford is turning stables in the grounds of his £6million mansion into a state-of-the-art space for making instruments which will allow him to fulfil his vow to keep working.

The 41-year-old father of two closed his shop in Haverhill, Suffolk in December because he said there was a 'Lotto cloud' hanging over it making him a target for begging strangers.

Along with his business partner and best friend Richard Hudspith, 38, Mr Bayford will launch the new online business in the spring.

His new workshop will make electric guitars, mandolins and ukeleles.

'From what I gather they had a lot of trouble with people coming into the store and asking for money,' said music teacher and customer Jonathan Coe.

'I think they didn't want their business to be so heavily associated with the Lotto win so they've closed up shop and are putting the store online.

'Adrian is currently converting old stables at their new property and making them into the workshops for Richard to continue his work with guitars.

'He'll be running the business from there and they are still very much in business together.'

Mr Bayford, a former postman, promised to keep his business open after he and wife Gillian, 40, won the enormous jackpot in August.

The down-to-earth pair celebrated by ordering a pizza from Domino's and taking an easyJet flight to Scotland.

Two weeks later Mr Bayford was back at work behind the counter of his shop, but last month 'Closing Down' signs appeared in the window.

A neighbouring businessman said: 'Adrian was getting a lot of grief from people walking in and trying to get cash off him.

'There are idiots in every town and some of them got nasty when he turned them away. He just does not need that kind of abuse.'

The Bayfords were unavailable for comment on their plans for the new business, and Mr Hudspith declined to give any details about the venture.

'Now we are enjoying some quiet time and don't want to say anything about the future,' he said.

'We have got a couple of things in the pipeline but do not wish to disclose exactly what they are at this time.'

Mr Bayford - who is 516th in the Sunday Times Rich List - started selling secondhand CDs on a market stall before opening his shop.

He and his wife splashed out on their 'Downton Abbey-style' mansion last November.
