Large courier firms often face the time-consuming task of planning the most efficient routes to deliver thousands of packages around the country every single day.

But a new blob of virtual goo can now do this for them - calculating the fastest travel routes which could help drastically cut the time it takes for couriers to make deliveries in the future.

This could mean consumers will not have to wait as long for orders from online companies such as Amazon to arrive on their doorstep.

A new 'intelligent goo' being developed by scientists can work out the shortest routes between destinations in a fraction of the time it takes current logistic managers to work out journeys for their couriers

Starting point: A blob of virtual goo is placed in a virtual petri dish with dots - highlighted in red and green - representing delivery destinations

Currently, firms still have to work out the length of every trip and which is shortest, Technology Review reports.

But this becomes increasingly difficult when it involves several cities and is computationally unfeasible.

So far, mathematicians have failed to find a shortcut that will solve this problem - known as the so-called P=NP debate.

The best they can currently manage is just trying to calculate which routes are the quickest without having any guarantee that they in fact are the best routes.

But Jeff Jones and Andrew Adamatzky at the University of the West of England have come up with a new 'intelligent' goo that could transform how delivery firms operate in the future.

Under focus: The goo is then shrunk but continues to cling to the dots within the petri dish

The goo works by representing cities or destinations as dots in a virtual petri dish and then submerging them in a blob of virtual goo.

The blob of goo is then shrunk but continues to cling to the dots as its shrinks - linking them across the smallest amount of surface. The resulting surface represents the best travel routes.

They told Technology Review: 'As the blob shrinks it morphologically adapts to the configuration of the cities.'

The goo itself consists of many particles that are placed in 'chemoattractant' - a virtual scent the particles are attracted to. 

Each particle senses the chemoattractant around it and then moves towards the region of highest concentration. Each then leaves behind its own trace of the chemoattractant for other particles to follow.

Revelation: As the goo shrinks it begins to show the shortest possible connecting routes between the dots

Jones and Adamatzky have tested out this intelligent goo to try and solve the difficulty of calculating the best delivery routes.

They used dots to represent 20 cities randomly distributed in a virtual petri dish and shrank the goo to see which routes it would leave.

They then compared the results to the actual shortest path worked out manually. 

If the shortest route has a length 1, the intelligent blob found tours with a mean best tour length of 1.04, mean average tour length of 1.07 and mean worst tour length of 1.09.

Speeding things up: The 'intelligent goo' system of working out routes is considerably simpler and quicker than the traditional method of working out each individual journey manually

This means that all the results very close to the actual shortest route available but could be simply worked out in a fraction of the time it would take to do it manually.

The one flaw is that the blob cannot cope with all city configurations, but it may form the basis for future systems of working out travel routes.

Jones and Adamatzky say the next step would be to create a physical model of this system in which a real blob does the work.

If further developed, it could later lead to logistics managers planning delivery routes by dipping road network models into vats of intelligent goo to solve their travel problems.

Trial stages: Jeff Jones and Andrew Adamatzky have been testing the goo at the University of the West of England with positive results
