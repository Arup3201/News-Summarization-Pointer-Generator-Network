A widower who lost his wife to Alzheimer's 72 years after their first kiss has touched hearts across Britain by penning a moving poem in her memory.

Bob Lowe, 93, from Barton-on-Sea in Hampshire, described the deep loneliness he has felt since his wife Kath died three years ago in his work Ode to Kath.

Their relationship survived the Second World War and they were together for six more decades. But the terrible disease took its toll in her later years, until one day she asked him: 'Where's Bob?'

I am alone, now I know it's true

There was a time when we were two

Those were the days when we would chat

Doing little jobs of this and that

We'd go to the shops and select our meals

But now I'm one I know how it feels

To try and cook or have meals on wheels

The rooms are empty there's not a sound

Sometimes I'm lost and wander round

To look for jobs that I can do

To bring back the days when we were two

When darkness falls and curtains drawn

That's when I feel most forlorn

But I must be honest and tell the truth

I'm not quite alone and here's the proof

Because beside me in her chair

She quietly waits our time to share

Kath said to me some time ago

Darling when the time comes for us to go

Let's mix our ashes and be together

So we can snuggle up for ever and ever.

Ode to Kath begins with the words: 'I am alone, now I know it's true. There was a time when we were two.' 

The poem prompted an instant outpouring of support yesterday after Bob read out his work on BBC Radio 4 and 5 Live to raise awareness of a loneliness helpline.

BBC bosses said they had responses from across the world from listeners who said the poem made them realise they were not alone. 

Radio 5 live Breakfast Editor Gill Farrington told MailOnline: 'It's extremely rare for an interview to touch the hearts of so many people.

'Bob's poem to his late wife in particular struck a chord with listeners. Many were moved to tears. 

'We've been overwhelmed by reaction from across the world since. People have wanted to share their experiences saying Bob's poem had made them realise they were not alone in their loneliness and grief.

'It was a privilege to speak to him.'

One Twitter user, @welshflier, wrote after the reading yesterday: 'Bob Lowe's matter-of-factness about old-age loneliness makes it more heartbreaking. Now cooking breakfast while crying.'

Another, Miles Evans, said: 'Don't often well up but Bob Lowe just made me. What a legend. Heartbreaking and spirit soaring at the same time'.

Bob and Kath met in 1937 but were separated when the Second World War broke out in 1939.

Despite the distance, they sent each other love notes and photographs and Bob proposed to his love while he was on active service.

They wed in 1946 upon his return and a friend who worked for Kodak recorded their wedding video in colour. 

They went on to have two daughters and a son. 

Bob said: 'Well, you're going back to 1937, I met my Kath. She was lovely.

'One of the guys said to me "Hey, she fancies you" and I said "Well I certainly fancy her". 

'Unfortunately in 1939, the war separated us, but while I was over there I thought I need to write to her and ask her to marry me.

'Family life in those days was a happy life.'

After six decades together, she her memory began to fade. Her husband raised the alarm with doctors after she failed to recognise him one night and she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. 

He said: 'One evening she turned around and and she looked at me and she said "Where's Bob?" and I said "I'm Bob". 

'The bottom dropped out of my world then. The doctors said she was in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.

'As she got worse it became more difficult to nurse her but she stayed here until the end.

'And eventually she passed away at one o'clock in the morning by my side.

'I couldn't believe it. She had gone. It was impossible to say goodbye or "I love you" any more.' 

Bob is now a community champion forThe Silver Line, a helpline for older people suffering from loneliness, which was started by Esther Rantzen. 

Outpouring: Twitter users showed support for Mr Lowe, saying his down-to-earth reading made them well up

He wrote a letter to the TV presenter after reading a newspaper article she wrote on loneliness and inspired her with the poem dedicated to his beloved wife.

It said: 'My wife died three months ago after 65 years of marriage but more to the point 72 years since we first kissed…and she waited throughout the war for me and I for her… loneliness tell me about it.'

Bob has also spoken movingly about his experiences to guests at The Silver Line national launch event in December last year. 

A rising number of men are facing loneliness in their old age. 

Charity Independent Age and the International Longevity Centre have said the number of older men living on their own is expected to increase by 65 per cent in the next 16 years.

Kath waited for Bob were married after he returned from war. 'She waited throughout the war for me and I for he,' said Bob

Esther Rantzen, The Silver Line founder, said: 'The truth about older people is that many of them have led long and fascinating lives but often feel that nobody is interested in their experiences. 

'So they are reluctant to talk about it and more than half of callers to The Silver Line callers tell us they have no one to speak to at all apart from The Silver Line. 

'Becoming a Silver Line Friend is an immensely rewarding and enjoyable thing to do, and our volunteers tell us they get as much out of the conversations as the older people they chat to.'  

The Silver Line Helpline, launched across the UK last November, following a grant from the Big Lottery, has already taken more than 230,000 calls from older people.

To contact Silver Line phone 0800 470 8090 or from a mobile phone 0300 470 8090.
