Distressed: The pair spoke directly into the camera after the incident

They were visiting the area to inspect a local prison with Peter Verzilov and members of NGO 'Zone of the Rights'.

Tolonnikova allegedly left the restaurant with a 'cut forehead' and the group have complained to the police.

She was seen getting up from her seat and clutching her face during the incident. while the gang of men continually shouted abuse.

When the attack eventually stopped, one of the men held up a sign to the camera while another was seen shouting down the lens.

At around 7.00 am the group barged into the fast food restaurant where the musicians and their crew were eating.

It is not the first time the group have been targeted by members of the public.

At the start of the Sochi winter 
Olympics, members of the group were whipped and tackled to the ground by Cossacks as
 they sang in protest.

The
 band started to perform an anti-Putin song under a sign advertising the
 Winter Olympics. But singer Tolokonnikova was brutally whipped
 in the attack and the guitarist was left bloodied and bruised.

Last month, Tolokonnikova was filmed saying the anti-government protests in Ukraine were an 'inspiation'.

She was also among those arrested during protests outside a Moscow courthouse.

Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina were released from seperate prisons on December 23, 2013 after the Russian State Duma approved an amnesty.
