An elderly woman driver escaped serious injury despite ploughing through a wall and crashing into a van in a neighbouring street.

The motorist, who has not been named, lost control of her silver Renault at 12.20pm last Friday in Royal Leamington Spa, Warks.

Shocked witnesses watched the woman trying to perform a three-point turn at the back of a block of flats in Newbold Terrace.

The woman, in her 80s, had pulled away from the kerb in Newbold Terrace, in Leamington Spa, only to lose control of her car and plough through a wall

After crashing through the wall and into a van, the motorist finally came to a rest in the adjacent Rosefield Street

But she lost control and ploughed through a wall before coming to rest in nearby Rosefield Street.

The woman, in her 80s, was treated by paramedics at the scene but did not require hospital treatment.

IT worker Jan Fenton, 34, of Leamington Spa, was walking home for lunch when she saw the crash. 

She said: “It was a freak accident but very lucky no one was hurt. I was walking home when I heard a loud bang.

Shocked witnesses described the crash as a 'freak accident' and said it was very lucky that no one had been hurt

“I turned round and literally just a few feet behind me there was a car-shaped hole in the wall which I had walked past just moments earlier.

“It’s a miracle the accident didn’t happen a few seconds earlier because I would have been run over or worse.

“The driver must have accidentally hit the accelerator pedal and just lost control. I’ve never known of anyone crashing a car in two streets before but there’s a first for everything.”
