Students the world over have always fought with each other, but when the dust-ups appear on social media it just makes for bad PR for the school involved.

This is why Kinross College in Perth is trying to shut down a Facebook page created by their students dedicated to showing fights at their school. However, Facebook has shown they’re also up for a scrap and have refused to bow to pressure from the college to shut down the page.

9News reported that the principal and parents at the Perth high school have demanded that the Facebook posting showing the playground brawls be taken down.

Two Kinross College year nine students square up in the fight posted on Facebook

It's the second clip of students fighting from Kinross College and the fourth from a Northern Suburbs school to be shared in the past week. A concerned parent contacted Facebook asking for the page to be removed because of its brutal content but they were adamant that the page did not breach its standards.

In one video on the Perth Fights page on Tuesday, two year nine students from Kincross College are shown punching and kicking each other. They're being cheered on by other students who can be heard in the background encouraging the fighters on by shouting: “Go…fight, fight, fight”. Both students in the latest video were suspended.

In an interview with the Today Show, Kincross College Principal Lloyd Page condemned the school-yard attack and requested Facebook take it down. 'We've consulted with our parents and our parents are happy with the sanctions we've put in with our students,' he said. 'From our point of view the issue’s been dealt with appropriately.'

Facebook maintained that the Perth Fights page was 'within the guidelines of their operating system'

However, Mr Page is hopeful that Facebook will accept that the footage is in bad taste and that they'll shut down the offending page.  

 'We have approached Facebook and we initially received a negative response from Facebook saying what's on the page was within the guidelines of their operating system,' he explained.

Parents of students were furious that the fights could be viewed on facebook

'However early this morning I have received information the Facebook page is still up, but the information has been taken down.'

Despite this though, a replacement 'fight' page has already been put up by students. All of which calls into question exactly how much parents know about what their children are uploading onto the likes of Facebook, and whether it is appropriate. 

School authorities have asked that the Facebook page be shut down due to its violent content 

'Parents have a huge responsibility and a huge role to play in all aspects of social media. They need to keep abreast of what's happening with social media. Our students are clearly more advanced... with this sort of technology,' Mr Page told the Today Show.

'Part of it is monitoring... and sitting and talking with students about the types of things going on social media.

'Once you're up on the social media page, that stays with you for the rest of your life.'
