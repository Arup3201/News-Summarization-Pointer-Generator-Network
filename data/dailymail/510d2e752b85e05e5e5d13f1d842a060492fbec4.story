Police were yesterday given a bag containing a computer, phone and paperwork found in a bin near the London home of Rebekah Brooks. 

Someone handed the items to security guards at the Chelsea Harbour complex of luxury apartments where she owns a £1.5million property.

It is understood that Mrs Brooks’s husband Charlie tried to reclaim them, but could not prove they were his – and the guards called police instead.

The bag was found in an underground car park in the Design Centre of the development on Monday afternoon.

The car park is under a shopping 
centre just yards from the gated apartment block where Mrs Brooks 
purchased a penthouse flat overlooking the River Thames in 2008.

She shares it with her husband Charlie Brooks, a former racehorse trainer and close friend of the Prime Minister David Cameron.

One source at the harbour complex 
said the bag was handed to security at around 3pm, and that shortly 
afterwards, Mr Brooks tried to reclaim it.

Detectives are now examining footage from CCTV cameras in the car park to discover who dropped the bag.

Mr Brooks’s spokesman denied the bag belonged to Mrs Brooks.

‘Charlie has a bag which contains a laptop and papers which were private to him,’ he said.

‘They were nothing to do with Rebekah or the [phone-hacking] case.’

He said Mr Brooks had left the bag with a friend who was returning it, but dropped it in the wrong part of the garage.

When asked how the bag ended up in a bin he replied: ‘The suggestion is that a cleaner thought it was rubbish and put it in the bin.’
‘Charlie was told it had gone to security, by which stage they 
[security] had already called the police to say they had found 
something.

‘The police took it away. Charlie’s lawyers got in touch with the police
 to say they could take a look at the computer but they’d see there was 
nothing relevant to them on it. He’s expecting the stuff back 
forthwith.’

Mrs Brooks launched a frantic fightback yesterday following her arrest, delivering a coded threat to sue police for blackening her name.

Her lawyer Stephen Parkinson said: ‘Despite interviewing her for nine hours, the police put no allegations to her. They will in due course have to give an account of their actions.’
