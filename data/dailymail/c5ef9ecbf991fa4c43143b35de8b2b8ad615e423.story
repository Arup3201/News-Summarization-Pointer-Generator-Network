Allegations: Cheick Tiote appeared at Newcastle Crown Court today charged with using a false Belgian licence

Newcastle United midfielder Cheick Tiote will contest charges that he used a fake Belgian driving licence, a court heard today.

Tiote, 27, is accused of five offences, including using a false document as a form of ID 'to establish personal information' about himself in December.

The Ivory Coast international is also charged with committing fraud by using the allegedly false document to get a UK licence, also in December.

In addition, he is accused of making a false statement to obtain insurance in September 2011 by allegedly claiming that he held a full driving licence without endorsements.

He is further charged with driving his Chevrolet, which bears the personalised licence plate T10 TEV, in Newcastle in February without a licence or insurance.

The French-speaking player wore jeans, a dark high-collared jacket and heavily embellished shoes for his brief appearance at Newcastle Crown Court today.

His barrister Robert Adams told the Recorder of Newcastle James Goss QC that he will need a French interpreter when the trial takes place on October 28.

Mark Giuliani, prosecuting, said: 'I understand that the matter will be contested and that a trial date in October would be convenient to the parties.'

The trial is expected to last three days.

Tiote, who has not entered pleas, will do so at a hearing on September 6. He was granted bail in the meantime.

Born in Ivory Coast, he moved to Belgian club Anderlecht in 2005.

The footballer then moved to Dutch side FC Twente, where he earned a reputation as a tough-tackling midfielder.

Tiote signed for Newcastle United in 2010.

The footballer lives in Newcastle's leafy suburb of Jesmond.

Trial: Tiote, who did not enter a plea, was granted bail ahead of a trial due to take place in October
