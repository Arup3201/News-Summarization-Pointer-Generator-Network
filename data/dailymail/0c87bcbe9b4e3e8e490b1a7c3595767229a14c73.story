Lawyer Robin Jacobs, 31, from London, was stunned to discover the outline of a penis imprinted on his Milkybar

A lawyer was stunned when he unwrapped a Milkybar - and discovered this likeness of a penis imprinted on the snack.

Eagle-eyed Robin Jacobs, 31, noticed that an indented image of a horse's head looked like a giant phallus.

The education lawyer believes the apparent presence of penis next to the famous Milkybar Kid is inappropriate for children.

He said: 'It was a little bit surprising, I don't think I've ever seen anything like it before that's for sure.

'What on earth is a penis doing on a children's chocolate bar? There's no point denying what it looks like. It is obvious - we can all see it.'

Mr Jacobs, from South Woodford, London, bought the 49p bar from a Tesco store to tuck into while watching the World Cup final on Sunday.

He said: 'I eat an awful lot of chocolate but I don't often have Milkybars - in all honesty I only bought it because it was on offer.

'I was eating it during the football match and I wasn't really paying much attention. Then I looked down and I was surprised to see a massive penis staring up at me.

Mr Jacobs, who normally sticks to Cadbury chocolate, opted for the Nestlé product for a change.

He said: 'I'm normally a Cadbury man but I decided to give the Milkybar a go and look what happened.

'It's a completely inappropriate picture. The penis in question is even bigger than the child - surely the people making the bar can see what it looks like.'

Mr Jacobs ate the Milkybar despite being put off.

He
 added: 'I never forget football matches and now the 2014 World Cup will
 always be remembered as the 'Milkybar penis' - it's not a great way to 
reminisce about it.'

Mr Jacobs reckons the Milkybar Kid's horse looks like a giant phallus and thinks it's 'inappropriate' for children

Nestle denied the image was a penis and insisted it is in fact the horse's head

A spokesperson from Nestlé denied the image was a penis.

She said: 'We're surprised and sorry to hear that Mr Jacobs thought the picture on the Milkybar resembles male genitalia. It is in fact an image of a horse's head belonging to the Milkybar Kid's. There was no intention to mislead or depict anything offensive on our product and we apologise for any confusion or embarrassment this may have caused.'
