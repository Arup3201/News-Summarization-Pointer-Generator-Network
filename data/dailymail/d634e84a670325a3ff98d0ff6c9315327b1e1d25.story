She may only be three years old, but Lil Lewis could give most of the Australian batting line-up a run for their money.

The talented Aussie has become an internet sensation after her older brother Seb uploaded videos of her impressive skills.

So far 56,000 people have watched her hit Test match quality shots in her back garden.

Lil's excellent batting, such as her cover drive, right,  has already been watched by 56,000 people online

Lil shows off a range of shots during the one minute video, including a cover drive, and posed footwork.

Her brother Seb can be heard laughing with excitement at the quality of his little sister's play and regularly shouts 'shot'

The proud brother has uploaded a number of videos of the child prodigy playing under the tag line 'Best 3 year old Australian cricketer'.

Seb is so confident in his sister's 
skills that in another video he bowls at her as she stands in front of 
the family's television.

She is so good that viewers have jokingly called for her to replace the country's top batsmen who are disarray after a 4-0 whitewash in their recent India test series.

Viewers have been most impressed by her excellent technique as she repeatedly hits boundary shots.

Like the professionals Lil even does a bit of gardening around the wicket between deliveries when she regularly smashed the ball for fours and sixes

One viewer, called Deepak Pachar wrote: 'Manh!! this girl plays exceptionally awesome!! better than 
the﻿ whole Australian Team (currently) !! she will be da next Don 
Bradman or Sachin Tendulkar!!'

Another wrote: 'Is she available for coaching assignments?﻿ Pakistan Cricket could use her help'.  Australian cricket fans want her to replace Shane Watson, who was recently sent home from his side's tour of India for not doing his homework, and open the batting for the team during the upcoming Ashes.
