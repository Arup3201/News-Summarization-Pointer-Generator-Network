A mother who lost her leg in an horrific car crash has found a new lease of life... thanks to pole dancing.

Lisa Eagleton, 40, had to have her right leg amputated below the knee following the smash in 2007.

But, after months of rehabilitation and support at a specialist centre, she regained her confidence and learned to walk again.

Lisa now takes part in competitions as Britain's only below-knee amputee pole dancer

The mother-of-four from Wigan - who is also known as Lady Lush Lisa - went on to become an alternative catwalk model.

Now she is also wowing crowds and takes part in competitions as Britain's only below-knee amputee pole dancer.

Lisa, who had enjoyed dancing before the crash, said: 'Even months after my amputation, I was in pain every day, living on morphine. The socket in my prosthetic leg rubbed, causing blisters that resulted in me being barely able to walk.

'I had lost my life as it was. I thought I had to accept my limitations. I was told I would never be as I was before my accident. Everyone was telling me what I couldn't do, what I no-longer was. I was depressed and in pain.'

Lisa was referred to the Pace Rehabilitation Centre in Cheadle, where the support helped her walk again.

Lisa shows off some of her incredible skills on the pole, which took a long time and determination to master 

Out of the blue she was offered a chance to take part in a photoshoot, which led to her becoming an alternative model and taking up pole dancing.

Lisa said: 'Since the accident, I felt unattractive, had low body confidence and was uncertain of what the world thought of a limbless woman. However, I felt it was time to accept that this was me, and rebuild myself.

'I had missed dance so much, but decided a route to return to it was pole dancing, as that was low impact on my leg and offered me support.

'My teachers helped me learn the moves, some of which took a long time to master, but I was determined to dance again.'

Lisa no longer feels the same low body confidence she had directly after her accident 

The challenges of pole dancing meant there were days when Lisa struggled to walk afterwards

The challenges of pole dancing meant there were days when Lisa struggled to walk afterwards, but her determined spirit saw her through.

She said: 'After lots of practice, I eventually managed to compete in some competitions and became Britain's only below-knee amputee pole dancer.'

Lisa, who swims eight hours a week and does yoga to help ease the pain she still suffers, said: 'There's always a way to do things to make you happy. The hardest thing is to take the first step.'

Victoria Bryne, from Pole Seduction, the Wigan pole dancing and fitness school where Lisa learned how to pole dance, said: 'The things she can do on the pole now are unbelievable. She does move after move and she's an inspiration to other girls in the class. I'm really proud of her.'
