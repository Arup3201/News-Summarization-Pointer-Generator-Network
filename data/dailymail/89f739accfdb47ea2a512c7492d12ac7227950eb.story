Singer Taylor Swift and YouTube star Zoella are among the artists helping Radio 1 launch its own video channel.

In a bid to rival the likes of YouTube and MTV, the BBC has launched a permanent, on-demand video section on its iPlayer service.

From today, the station will begin offering exclusive content including live performances, documentaries and interviews.

Station controller Ben Cooper hailed it as a ‘historic moment’ which allows its fans to watch content on a range of devices, including phones and tablets.

‘What you'll find on iPlayer will focus on Radio 1 live events, our family of brilliant presenters, and, of course, the lives of our young audience,’ said Mr Cooper.

Each week, there will be a 15-minute show hosted by Chris Stark called ICYMI. 

The Official Chart Bite will be weekly, and presented by YouTube stars Jack and Dean.

And a Radio 1 DJ will put together their top five things to watch on BBC iPlayer.

Other content available at launch include: 

Live Lounge sessions and exclusive interviews from Royal Blood, and Taylor Swift.

A 2011 Live Lounge special from Adele.

A 20-minute show featuring YouTube stars Zoella and ThatcherJoe. 

Three shows from Radio 1's Teen Awards.

Performances from Radio 1Xtra Live in Birmingham.

Interviews with Rick Ross and Mary J Blige. 

‘Underpinning much of this is our dedication to discovering and curating the best new music.’

The first content to be available from launch includes Taylor Swift, and Royal Blood Live Lounge performances and interviews, footage of YouTube stars Zoe ‘Zoella’ Sugg and Joe ‘ThatcherJoe’ Sugg during a recent visit, and a chart rundown.

There will also be a regular catch-up programme taking in the previous week's highlights called In Case You Missed It (ICYMI), hosted by Chris Stark.

Content from Radio 1Xtra will also air on the site, including interviews with Mary J Blige and RIck ROss. 

And each week, a Radio 1 DJ will put together their top five things to watch on the iPlayer.

Plus the section features archive content, including a 2011 Live Lounge special from Adele featuring six tracks.

All videos are available to watch for 30 days from when they are uploaded. 

The BBC Trust approved the move earlier this month.

BBC Trustee Suzanna Taverne said: ‘It will build on the great success Radio 1 already has online, although it will be important to ensure that everything available through the iPlayer area is consistent with Radio 1's distinctive identity.’

‘It certainly feels exciting to see it come to fruition - having been a year since it was first mentioned,' added Mr Cooper.

‘Our challenge is to continue to develop a proposition that both brings new young audiences to BBC iPlayer and also acts as another access point for audiences to discover the breadth of incredible content that Radio 1 delivers.

The move will also capitalise on Radio 1’s 1.65 million YouTube subscribers. 

Mr Cooper continued: 'For those of us who work in the radio industry, this is further statistical evidence of what we know anecdotally: if we want to remain relevant to young audiences, we need to have a presence on their screens.

'Even the most passionate radio advocates know that we need to continue to evolve our offering and ensure we give our young audience a reason to forsake Minecraft and GTA and spend their precious screen time with us instead.

Last week, Taylor Swift removed her entire back catalogue from  Spotify.

The decision came at the same time she was promoting new album 1989, which sold 1.287 million copies in its first week - just shy of Britney Spears' biggest-ever album weekly sales by a female artist. 

'If I had streamed the new album, it’s impossible to try to speculate what would have happened,' Ms Swift explained. 

'But all I can say is that music is changing so quickly, and the landscape of the music industry itself is changing so quickly, that everything new, like Spotify, all feels to me a bit like a grand experiment. 

'And I’m not willing to contribute my life’s work to an experiment that I don’t feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists, and creators of this music.'

The 24-year-old added: 'And I just don’t agree with perpetuating the perception that music has no value and should be free.'
