Kelly McManus says she lost her confidence after having her first child at the age of 21 and struggling to lose her 'mummy tummy'

An aspiring actress was given a £5,000 tummy tuck on the NHS so she could pursue her dream of becoming the next Julia Roberts.

Kelly McManus said she lost her confidence after having her first child at the age of 21 and struggling to lose her ‘mummy tummy’.

The part-time beautician, who earns £7,000 a year, could not afford the operation and begged doctors to get rid of her bulge.

After 18 months of visiting her GP, Miss McManus was referred to a surgeon for the taxpayer-funded operation.

The single mother-of-three, who once appeared on Jeremy Kyle, said: ‘My new tummy has changed my life.

'I feel like a new woman. I can’t wait to start acting lessons now. Who knows, maybe I could be the next Julia Roberts.’

But on an acting website Miss McManus admits she has no experience, writing: ‘The last acting I did was 11 years ago at school!

'Although I did get an A grade in Drama so I can’t be that bad.’

The 27-year-old believes the operation has actually saved the NHS cash, claiming that it would have cost the organisation more money to treat her depression.

She said: ‘After my first child my stomach never went back to its normal size. Then after my third child the midwife said, “You do know that your stomach muscles have separated from your bulge.”

‘It looked like I was still pregnant and people even asked me, “How far on are you?” It was just so embarrassing. I lost all my confidence because of it. It was leaving me depressed and ruining my sex life.’

Miss McManus said she can't wait to start acting lessons, adding 'Who knows, maybe I could be the next Julia Roberts'

The operation to remove the excess skin on Miss McManus's abdomen was carried out at Bradford Royal Infirmary (pictured) last month

In desperation, Miss McManus began 
investigating cosmetic surgery. She said: ‘I looked online and realised I
couldn’t afford the £5,000 cost so the NHS was my only hope.

‘At
first the doctor recommended physiotherapy and exercise. I was seeing 
her for a couple of months and she said she couldn’t repair my stomach 
muscles.’

Eventually,
Miss McManus was referred to a surgeon. She said: ‘I was scared because
I have never had surgery before but I knew it would change my life.’

Controversial: Jodie Cunningham had her breasts enlarged to 36DD on the NHS - and now wants them reduced, as well as compensation

The three-hour operation to remove the excess skin on her abdomen was carried out at Bradford Royal Infirmary last month.

Miss McManus told The Sun:
‘I am more confident and a lot happier than I was. It changed my 
outlook on life. It’s only been four weeks and the scars are still 
healing but I just feel absolutely brilliant.’

But campaigners were outraged at the decision to fund Miss McManus’s operation when cuts are being made elsewhere in the NHS. A spokesman from The TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It’s ridiculous that the NHS pays for procedures that are not based on strict medical needs. Patients missing out on vital drugs and treatment will find this deeply unfair.’

It follows the case of 23-year-old Josie Cunningham, who had £4,800 breast enlargement surgery on the NHS in January after complaining she had been bullied over her flat 32A chest.

But after undergoing the operation, the aspiring model from Leeds said her 36DD breasts had made her the target of online abuse.

Miss Cunningham then said she would like a reduction and compensation.

She claimed she was not properly consulted before her operation and wanted compensation for clinical negligence and emotional distress.

Miss Cunningham, who works in telesales, consulted no-win, no-fee lawyers so she can ‘take [the NHS] for every penny’.

She said: ‘I want in excess of £10,000. Anything I can get over that is a bonus.’

Miss Cunningham told The Sun: ‘I was rushed through the process. I didn’t actually ask for 36DD — I would have been happier with a B cup.

‘But they told me that because I didn’t have any breast tissue I’d have to go for bigger breasts. They haven’t helped me one bit. In fact, my life is ruined.’

Meanwhile, just a few miles away from 
her home in Leeds, two-year-old cerebral palsy sufferer Oliver Dockerty 
had been turned down for funding for an operation which could allow him 
to walk.

Thankfully, after reading about his 
plight in the Daily Mail, generous readers helped to raise the £24,000 
needed for Oliver to have his operation privately.

Cosmetic surgery is provided by the NHS only if there is a clinical need

Cosmetic procedures are not normally done on the NHS unless doctors decide there is a clinical need.

This
decision is taken at a local level, by the Primary Care Trust (PCT), on
the basis of reports submitted by a patient's doctors.

PCTs set their own criteria according to what, in their view, are the health needs of the local community.

For
cosmetic surgery, the usual protocol is that the PCT must decide there 
is some kind of clinical, ie health, need for the operation to be funded
on the NHS.  Simply wanting to look nicer in itself is not reason 
enough.

Leeds Primary Care Trust, also known as NHS Leeds, offers a
list of cosmetic procedures that may be available on its website.  They
include breast augmentation, breast reduction, eyelid surgery 
(blepharoplasty), and rhytidectomy (wrinkle removal including face 
lift).

It says these may be available 'providing certain criteria can be met', and lists the criteria.

The
criteria required for breast augmentation include suffering from 
certain rare syndromes, severe asymmetry (more than two cup sizes 
difference), or lumpectomy that results in deformity.

Rare cases, 
however, such as Ms Cunningham's, have to be go through the Individual 
Funding Request process, in which each case is decided upon its 
individual merits.
