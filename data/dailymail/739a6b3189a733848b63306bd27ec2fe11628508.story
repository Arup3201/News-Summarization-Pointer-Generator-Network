Russian president Vladimir Putin risked accusations of stifling dissent in Moscow today as police cracked down on a rally in support of a group anti-government protesters facing jail.

At least 100 were detained outside a courthouse in central Moscow where the defendants were sentenced today in the first protest since the fall of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich following protests there.

Among those arrested were Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alekhina, from Pussy Riot, the dissident punk band.

Putin is rumoured to be sheltering the ousted leader, an ally of the Kremlin, in the Crimea, a majority Russian area of Ukraine where the Russian Black Sea naval fleet is based.

It is the first sign of how the hardline Russian president will respond to demonstrations against him since his Ukranian ally Viktor Yanukovych was toppled last week by protesters in Kiev

Police detained dozens of people protesting against the trial of anti- Vladimir Putin campaigners today. Many, including this woman, wore badges marked 6 May in the Russian alphabet, a reference to previous protests calling for Putin to be denied office over allegations he rigged his last presidential election. Some of the people found guilty of being ringleaders of the protests on 6 May 2012 were being sentenced at the court where today's demonstrations took place

Today there were the first signs of 
support for the Ukraine demonstrations in Moscow, during a demonstration
 outside a court where opposition activists are being sentenced.

Demonstrators, who were joined by one of the members of the dissenting punk band Pussy Riot, shouted 'shame' at riot police as around 100 people were taken into custody

They also shouted 'Maidan' - a 
reference to the square in Ukraine's capital at the heart of 
anti-government protests that have driven President Viktor Yanukovich 
from power - and called the Russian police 'Berkut' after the Ukrainian 
riot police that battled protesters in Kiev.

Among the crowd were Nadezhda
 Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina, the Pussy Riot members who were 
released near the end of their two-year sentences for an anti-Putin 
protest in Moscow's main cathedral during his presidential campaign.

Seven of the defendants were handed 
prison terms ranging from two and a half to four years after they were 
convicted of rioting and attacking police at a protest against President
 Vladimir Putin in 2012.

An eighth defendant was given a suspended sentence, meaning she will avoid jail.

Russian president Vladimir Putin meets his country's Winter Olympics athletes in Sochi today, including figure skater Adelina Stonikova, who won a surprise gold in the women's figure skating category. In Moscow, however, security forces cracked down in dissenters who expressed support for the toppling of his ally Viktor Yanukovych, the former president of Ukraine

Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Alexy Voevoda, a bobsledder who won double Olympic gold in the two-man and four-man versions of his event. Mr Putin met Russian medallists from the Winter Olmpics in Sochi, at the same time as the first signs of opposition activists in Russia supporting the revolution in Ukraine emerged - and were met with a fierce response form police.

Vladimir Putin pins a medal to the chest of Russia's most famous skater, Yevgeny Plushenko, as he meets the country's medal winners at Sochi. Plushenko announced his retirement after being injured as he prepared to compete, although he later said he may want to compete again in 2018. Plushenko was previously an opposition MP.

Relatives
 feared upheaval in Ukraine, where police officers were among the dead 
in a conflict the Kremlin blames on opposition leaders and the West, 
would prompt the Russian court to send a firm signal by imposing long 
sentences.

Hundreds
 came to support the defendants in the 'Bolotnaya' case whom Kremlin 
critics see as victims of a clampdown on dissent during Putin's third 
term.

The
 judge on Friday found the defendants guilty of rioting and attacking 
police at a protest on May 6, 2012, the day before Putin, in power since
 2000, returned to the presidency after a stint as prime minister.

The 
defendants blame police for the clashes that erupted at the rally and 
pleaded not guilty.

As
 the judge continued reading the verdict today in the courtroom, where 
the male defendants were handcuffed in a cage, camouflage-clad riot 
police with batons pushed into the crowd outside, barred from 
approaching the court by metal barriers, and seized demonstrators one by
 one.

Moscow
 police said more than 100 people were detained for attempts to violate 
public order, according to Interfax news agency. Opposition activists 
said the number was more than 140.

Police detained 65 people who they said had blocked the road or tried to break through police lines

Eight opposition activists accused and found guilty of participating in mass riots on Bolotanaya square stand in a cage at Zamosvoretsky district court

Among
 those detained was Alexei Navalny, who emerged from a series of street 
protests in 2011-2012 as the top opposition leader. He is serving a 
five-year suspended sentence on a theft conviction he says was Kremlin 
revenge for challenging Putin.

'They
 have put me in an avtozak,' Navalny said on Twitter, referring to one 
of several police vans and buses that police were bundling detainees 
into near the courthouse.

Prosecutors
 have asked for sentences of five to six years for the defendants, seven
 men and a woman, most of them in their 20s. Putin denies using the 
courts as a political tool but has said people who attack police must be
 punished.

Sentences
 longer than time served would anger Kremlin opponents and likely draw 
criticism from the United States and European countries that have 
expressed concern about the trial and accused Russia of resticting 
freedoms.

After
 reading part of the verdict on Friday, judge Natalya Nikishina abruptly
 stopped and called a break until Monday, sparking speculation the 
Kremlin wanted to keep the sentences under wraps until after the end of 
the Sochi Olympics on Sunday.

Putin,
 who staked his reputation on the Olympics, engineered the release of 
long-jailed ex-tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and two women from protest 
band Pussy Riot in December, moves widely seen as an effort to improve 
his image before the Games.
