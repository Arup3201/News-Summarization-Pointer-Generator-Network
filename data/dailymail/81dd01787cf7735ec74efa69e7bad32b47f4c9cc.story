A 15-year-old boy had to be rescued from a children's swing by firemen after climbing into it and getting stuck.

The unnamed teenager was visiting a park in Plymouth, Devon, with friends when he decided to squeeze his legs into the tiny seat.

But after trying to lift himself back out of it, he realised he was wedged in.

The boy tried in vain to wriggle free, before finally giving in and calling the fire brigade for help.

Firefighters arrived at the scene and spent 30 minutes dismantling the swing in a bid to rescue him.

The teenager was visibly embarrassed as crews worked to free him - holding one hand to his face as his amused friends looked on. 

Today, Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service warned others about repeating last night’s stunt at Central Park.

A spokesman said: 'One appliance went to the incident at 7.40pm. They dismantled the swing using small tools and were there for around half an hour.

'Accidents do happen and we always help people in need but there might have been a more serious incident for us to attend.

'We would ask people to be careful about using age-appropriate play equipment.'
