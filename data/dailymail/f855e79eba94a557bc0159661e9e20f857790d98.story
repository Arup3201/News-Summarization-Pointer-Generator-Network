Renowned fashion designer Collette Dinnigan has bought the stylish waterfront home of James Packer's right hand man in one of Sydney's most exclusive suburbs.

The fashionista and her husband Bradley Cocks have reportedly paid about $7 million for the lavish Watsons Bay property, in Sydney's east.

Matthew Csidei - who works for James Packer - and wife Lauren Roscoe lived at the former Masonic Lodge before they moved to London with their two kids, according to the Property Observer.

This comes as Dinnigan sold her multi-million dollar Palm Beach home last year and earlier closed all of her boutiques  so she could spend more time with her two young children.

The  four-bedroom property in Watsons Bay has luxurious features including 18th century French oak parquetry floors, a 20-metre lap pool and views Sydney Harbour.

Real estate agents marketed the home as expertly rebuilt from a shell in 2008 'into a classical Beaux-Arts inspired contemporary home'.

The Property Observer reported the house was listed for about $8 million.

It was sold by Ballard Property and Sydney Sotheby's Realty last Wednesday, March 18.

In September last year Dinnigan and her husband sold their Palm Beach home for $3.2million.

The couple purchased the home in 2010 for $3million and went on to refurbish it during their four year stay. 

The three-bedroom property was bought by The Castle actress Sophie Lee and her husband, CEO of advertising agency Host, Anthony Freedman.   

Dinnigan also reportedly has a home in Paddington and a holiday house on the south coast.
