Kim Jong-un clearly still has a burning desire to smoke, with recent pictures showing him puffing away on an airfield and sitting next to an ashtray at a shooting range.

If the North Korean leader isn’t smoking in photographs, an ashtray is often in close proximity.

Consideration for others while he smokes is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a low priority, with a photograph released in 2013 showing him smoking in a hospital.

He had apparently stressed to workers at Taesongsan General Hospital in Pyongyang that hospitals should be ‘neat and splendid and dust-free’.

And in December he was pictured with cigarette in hand in a command centre after North Korea launched a satellite.

On Tuesday the North Korean Central News Agency released a picture of Jong-un and his customary ashtray at a shooting practice in Pyongyang.

He is seen laughing heartily with army chiefs as he holds a pair of binoculars.

Another picture shows the leader wearing a big grin and smoking while standing next to a North Korean fighter jet.

The pictures emerged as China dismissed a UN report alleging North Korea has committed crimes against humanity.

It effectively confirmed the fears of human rights advocates that Beijing will shield its ally from international prosecution.

The report, published in February, accused the reclusive country of mass killings and torture comparable to Nazi-era atrocities and said officials, possibly even Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un himself, should face the International Criminal Court (ICC).

Chen Chuandong, a counsellor at China's mission in Geneva, told the U.N. Human Rights Council that the independent commission of inquiry had made unfounded accusations and recommendations that were ‘divorced from reality’.

‘The inability of the commission to get support and cooperation from the country concerned makes it impossible for the commission to carry out its mandate in an impartial, objective and effective manner,’ Chen said.

China, as a member of the U.N. Security Council, would have the power to veto any move to refer North Korea to the Hague-based ICC. Diplomats had already warned China was likely to object to the report, which also criticised Beijing for its treatment of North Korean defectors.

But Michael Kirby, chief author of the report, said he was convinced North Korea's leadership would eventually face the ICC for crimes documented in the commission's archives, which hold the testimonies of hundreds of witnesses.

‘I have lived long enough to see things that looked impossible come to full fruit,’ Kirby told a news conference.
