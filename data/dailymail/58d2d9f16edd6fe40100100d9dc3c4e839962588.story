Jonny Sexton left the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin on Sunday afternoon with a heavily bruised left eye after colliding with Mathieu Bastareaud during his side's 18-11 win.

The Ireland fly-half, who impressed against France by firing 15 points against Philippe Saint-Andre's side, was involved in a number of head-punishing collisions with Bastareaud.

Sexton was making his first appearance since being ruled out of action for 12 weeks with concussion.

The 29-year-old played down the blow to his eye after the win match against France.

He told the BBC: 'It was just a glancing blow.

'I just needed a couple of stitches but I felt fine after it.'

Sexton added he was looking forward to facing England on March 1 following successive wins against Italy and France.

'We're delighted [with our form]. We've got a lot to improve on and we've got a big match here in two weeks against England.'
