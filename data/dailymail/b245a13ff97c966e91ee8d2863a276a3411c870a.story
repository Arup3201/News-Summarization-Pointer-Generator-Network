Ukip's only Scottish MEP David Coburn is facing calls to resign

Nigel Farage is today at the centre of a political storm after refusing to condemn his party's only elected politician in Scotland for comparing an SNP minister to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza.

The Ukip leader claimed that David Coburn's controversial remark was merely a 'joke in poor taste' and has rejected cross-party demands to kick the MEP out of the party.

The Daily Mail told on Saturday how Mr Coburn, who is also bidding to become an MP in the General Election, said in conversation: 'Humza Yousaf, or as I call him, Abu Hamza.'

Mr Yousaf, the Scottish Minister for Europe and International Development, last night said Mr Farage's response was 'pitiful' and challenged him to sack Mr Coburn.

Mr Yousaf is now taking legal advice following the 'Islamophobic' slur, and will subsequently consider reporting the issue to the police.

Scotland's party leaders and high-profile UK politicians have joined forces to condemn Mr Coburn.

An online petition calling for Mr Coburn to resign has been launched, with nearly 300 signatures as of last night.

In the wake of the controversy, the SNP has called on  David Cameron to rule out a post-election deal with Ukip.

Mr Coburn, who has insisted his remark was made 'in jest', made the comment  during a telephone conversation with the Scottish Daily Mail last week, in which he spoke about his appearance on BBC Two show The Big Immigration Debate.

He claimed that Mr Yousaf was supposed to appear on the programme, and said: 'Humza Yousaf, or as I call him, Abu Hamza, didn't seem to turn up.'

Challenged by the Mail during the conversation, Mr Coburn said the remark was intended to be private. However, there had been no prior agreement that the discussion was off-the -record.

Hook-handed Hamza was earlier this year given a life sentence by a New York judge for supporting terrorism.

The hate cleric was convicted last May of multiple charges, including hostage-taking and plotting to set up a terror training camp in the US.

The Scottish Daily Mail telephoned Ukip leader Nigel Farage yesterday to ask for his response to Mr Coburn's remark.

He replied: 'I really haven't read them in full, to be honest with you, I've been busy doing other things.' Informed of what was said and told that Mr Yousaf has called for disciplinary action against Mr Coburn for making an 'Islamophobic' comment, Mr Farage replied: 'What, for telling a joke in poor taste?'

He added: 'It looks to me like a joke. I haven't spoken to Mr Coburn at all, but I assume it's a joke in poor taste.'

Pressed if he would suspend Mr Coburn, he said: 'No... come on, this is nonsense isn't it?

'The bloke has made a joke in poor taste is my interpretation of it. I think one should make jokes in good taste, not jokes in poor taste.'

Asked again if he would take any action, Mr Farage said: 'Not right now. I have many other things on my plate, this is not top of my list. I don't deal with party discipline, I'm the political leader.'

Mr Farage then ended the call. Ukip MEP for the East Midlands, Roger Helmer, also refused to condemn his colleague and wrote on Twitter: 'David Coburn makes a lighthearted remark, & the politically correct brigade go into overdrive. Grow up, guys.'

Last night, Mr Yousaf said: 'Racism and Islamophobia are no laughing matter.

'This is a pitiful response from Mr Farage - at best it shows he doesn't have a clue of what's going on in his own party and at worst it indicates he doesn't see anything wrong in what Mr Coburn has said.

'Mr Coburn is not fit for public life and must be sacked by his leader.' The SNP minister said he is seeking legal advice on whether the remark may have broken laws on racial and religious hatred.

He added: 'It has been heartening to see the opposition parties condemn Mr Coburn's comments - and I have also been overwhelmed by the many messages of support and encouragement I have received from people across the country.'

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the slur was 'reprehensible'.

Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said of the Ukip MEP: 'People across Scotland, including even those who voted for him, will now want to see the back of him.'

Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives tweeted: 'Totally unacceptable. Our country is better than this. And he's got form. Mindless idiot.'

Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie called Mr Coburn 'an offensive fool' while the Scottish Green Party has called for Mr Coburn's resignation.

Asid Khan, president of Glasgow Central Mosque, said: 'David Coburn's unacceptable Islamophobia has no place in a tolerant, diverse Scotland.

'Muslims have spent years rightly distinguishing the true teachings of Islam against the actions of terrorists. For an elected member to refer to Humza Yousaf as a convicted extremist is beyond the pale. David Coburn's remarks have deeply insulted the entire Muslim community in Scotland.'

Vicki Burns, of Show Racism the Red Card Scotland, said: 'Ukip claim that they are not a racist party, therefore they must treat the racist language and behaviour of their members seriously.'

Mr Coburn was also criticised by former First Ministers Jack McConnell and Henry McLeish.

However, Ukip's Scottish chairman, Arthur Misty Thackeray, claimed his colleague had made a 'slip of the tongue' and 'got a name wrong'.

He said: 'I very often get referred to as Minty, which I believe is a character from EastEnders, but I don't take offence and run greeting to the papers about Mistyphobia.' Mr Coburn did not respond to a request for a comment.

In an email to Mr Yousaf, headed Sincere Apology, he wrote: 'In reference to a private comment I made, reported to you by Alan Roden, I am very sorry that I have offended you as I clearly have. It was wrong to say what I did, even in jest, it was not something of which I am proud.

'Please accept my sincere apologies for the inference, it was wrong.'
