Chelsea striker Demba Ba is joining Besiktas for £8million.

The Turkish side denied talks were advanced on Tuesday but have reached a compromise over the fee with Chelsea and hope to finalise the move on Wednesday.

Besiktas president Fikret Orman, who also wants to sign Fulham striker Bryan Ruiz, said: 'Talks are ongoing, Chelsea initially wanted £10m for Ba but we have negotiated a price we are happy with.'

Ba, 29, had attracted interest from 
Everton also but they are hoping to sign Romelu Lukaku ahead of Atletico
 Madrid and Wolfsburg.

Ba spent much of last season as Chelsea's third-choice option up front but had a decent end to the season, scoring game-winning goals against Paris St Germain, Swansea and Liverpool.

Chelsea signed Ba from Newcastle for £7million in January 2013. He also spent time at West Ham and Hoffenheim before moving to Stamford Bridge.
