I have to confess I am not a fan of celebrity fragrances. I have never found one I liked since the launch of the most successful celebrity perfume of all time - Elizabeth Taylor White Diamonds Eau de Toilette (£53 for 100ml, Debenhams)

Elizabeth Taylor created White Diamonds in 1991. With top of notes of neroli, lily and tuberose; middle notes of orris and amber and the base of sandalwood, patchouli and oak moss – it remains a glorious scent and is still a best seller – even after 23 years!

Since then we have seen the launch of dozens of celebrity scents. Mostly I find them too sweet, too cloying and with an annoying tendency to linger on your skin a tad longer than you want them to.

Chic: Cheryl recently launched her fragrance, Storm Flower, which has a sweet scent with fruity notes

Understated: The bottle is pretty and cute - like Cheryl herself

When the latest celebrity fragrance lands on my desk to try, it is unlikely that it will end up on my bathroom shelf, let alone on my wrists.

So the news this week that our love affair with celebrity fragrances is cooling off, is strangely timed - especially as this week two new celebrity scents hit the shelves and another launches in the next few weeks.

Such is the excitement surrounding Cheryl Cole's first ever fragrance, Storm Flower, that Superdrug have brought forward the on sale date by a week.

It will be stocked exclusively at all stores from today - Friday 22nd August - until 8th September, before the fragrance is available nationwide. Superdrug is hugely optimistic, expecting to sell 30,000 bottles of Storm Flower by Cheryl in the first month - almost 1,000 bottles a day.

So what's it like? First impressions are promising. It is not what I expected. The Eau de parfum comes in a rose gold box, with a classy looking purple border.

And unlike the One Direction fragrance, which has the boys' pictures plastered all over the box, this simply has the name of the perfume on the box, with the name CHERYL in capital letters underneath.

Third scent: One Direction launch their latest perfume, You & I, which comes in an Art Deco style bottle

The effect is understated and chic, but I found the fragrance had a powerful kick. There are top notes of mandarin and nectarine, with the addition of vanilla, white musk and precious sandalwood. It is very sweet and certainly long lasting. I could still smell this 12 hours after first spraying it.

The best thing about this perfume is the bottle. It is really pretty and cute - like Cheryl herself - with a beautiful rose gold lid in the shape of a golden flower. The bottle will appeal to all ages, but suspect what’s inside it will appeal more to younger fans.

Cheryl joins a long line of celebrities to have launched their own perfumes. Superstar Beyoncé has sold more than half a million bottles of fragrance at Superdrug since launching Heat in 2010, and her latest fragrance, Rise, has proven itself the best-selling celebrity fragrance of 2014 to date.

Other celebrity fragrance winners included Jay Z, whose GOLD Jay Z fragrance came second in sales only to his wife's. 

Britney Spears, whose fragrances have been consistent best sellers since the launch of Curious in 2004, rounds off the top three with Fantasy Naughty & Nice Remix.

One Direction's Our Moment still a top five best seller a nearly a year after release. With the fragrance selling 1.5million bottles over last Christmas period, the boys will be looking to repeat the success with their latest offering, You and I, which went on sale on Wednesday.

I reviewed One Direction's first fragrance 'Our Moment' when it launched. It was officially the fastest-selling celebrity perfume of all time following record-breaking sales in its first week of release in August 2013.

At the time, I wasn't very kind about it, but the legions of One Direction fans obviously didn't agree and bottles flew off the shelves.

Top scent seller: Could Cheryl knock Beyonce off her perch with her new fragrance?

You & I by One Direction, £19.50 for 30ml EDP (Superdrug) is the third addition to One Direction's popular perfume collection. It combines bright splashes of mango and refreshing grapefruit with a heart of creamy osmanthus, exotic orchid and soft peony.

I found it quite similar to their first fragrance. If anything, this is a subtler, a little more grown up and certainly not as overpowering. When I sprayed it at first I found it far too sweet, but as it settled down a bit I actually found myself liking it. What a surprise!

It comes in a striking glass bottle, which somehow does not match the fragrance - it is elegant and sophisticated with an Art Deco style lid. This will definitely please all of One Direction's fans who love everything they do.

There isn't one of these bottles that I wouldn't be happy to display on my dressing table. The real secret of a successful celebrity scent is in the design of the bottle recent years Nicki Minaj's scents have become collectors' items - because of the exquisite bottles that look like works of art.

The original Nikki Minaj Pink Friday fragrance launched in April 2013 and was the third biggest selling women’s fragrance, beating everything except Chanel No 5 and Coco Mademoiselle.

Quirky: The new Nikki Minaj ONIKA fragrance, on sale in September

Fans will no doubt be flocking to buy the new Nikki Minaj ONIKA fragrance, £28.50 for 50ml EDT (The Perfume Shop) when it hits the shelves on 17th September. This new bottle doesn't disappoint and I think could be my favourite so far.

The new fragrance is bold, with fruity notes of pear and mandarin with the floral scent of water lily and orchid with and a tiny touch of sweet sugar cane and musk.

I have tried this one too - and was pleasantly surprised. Not too heavy or sickly, as a light scent for early autumn days it fits the bill perfectly.

But with the news this week that the celebrity scent market has lost its gloss, with sales down thirty percent of some names including Justin Bieber's fragrance, are the stores getting worried?

Michael Hume, senior fragrance buyer at Superdrug says: 'Celebrity fragrance really resonates with shoppers as it lets fans buy a little piece of their icon. While some celebrity fragrances may have lost their sparkle in recent months, the right star and the right fragrance will always succeed.

'We've long expected Cheryl to launch her own, and we're predicting big things. With X Factor in the pipeline and her latest single topping the charts, she's truly on top of her game and fragrance is the next logical step.'

I have heard that Lady Gaga is also rumoured to be bringing out a new scent… let's hope she has the bottle to do it.
