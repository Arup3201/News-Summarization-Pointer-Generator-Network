Unforgiveable: Aaron Daniel Benson, 25, was arrested Sunday night for drunk driving and crashing into a woman's house - killing the 71-year-old

An elderly woman was killed in her sleep Sunday night in Lancaster, California after a repeat drunk-driver crashed into her bedroom. 

The drunk driver has since been identified as 25-year-old Aaron Daniel Benson, a local in the area who was previously arrested for DUI in 2011. 

Authorities say he was driving drunk again Sunday night when he hit several cars parked along West Ave J-12 before swerving into a yard and crashing into the front bedroom of a house on the 1000 block of the street.  

The 71-year-old woman who lives alone at the house was later found dead in her bed, crushed underneath Benson's Toyota pick-up truck.

Her identity has not yet been revealed, as authorities seek to notify her remaining family. 

Neighbors ran to the woman's aid after the 10:55pm accident, and witnessed a disoriented Benson. 

'The driver of the truck emerged and he was freaking out, walking all over the place. He didn't know what to do. They were finally able to get into the house, and we couldn't find the lady anywhere. Then, the cops and ambulance showed up,' one neighbor told ABC 7. 

'Nobody could find her until they pulled the truck out, so basically she was under the truck.'
