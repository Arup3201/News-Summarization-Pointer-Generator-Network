The pizza delivery guy who showed up during the Oscars was not an actor but a genuine employee at a pizzeria only blocks from the Dolby Theater, where the award ceremony was held.

The Big Mama's and Papa's worker who delivered Ellen DeGeneres' huge order to the Academy Awards was revealed to really work at the chain's Sunset Boulevard location.

He received a $150 tip, but it is not known if he will see the further $300 later collected in Pharrell's famously large hat as host Ellen DeGeneres passed it around the star-studded audience.

Pizza time: Ellen DeGeneres surprised the Oscars audience on Sunday with a real pizza delivery guy bringing fresh pies, but he never saw the big tip she collected for him, according to TMZ

A store employee confirmed to MailOnline 
the man is an employee at the location, but declined to give his name or
 provide any further information past the order amount. He was later named as Edgar.

A separate source said he was fulfilling an order for 
five of the chain's specialty Big Papa's - at 60 square slices each - 
and a selection of smaller pies.

'Yes, we did [deliver the pizza]. We had a couple of guys during the Oscars, the source said. 'It was five Big Papas at 60 square slices each. But they got a bunch more, those were just the big ones.'

He did not initially know what the plan was, but Ellen coaxed him out on stage and then into the front row where he helped hand out pieces to stars including Brad Pitt, Jared Leto, Julia Roberts, Kerry Washington and Meryl Streep.

As Ellen persuaded the stars to dig in, the bemused delivery guy doled out the squares behind her.

He
 dutifully followed Ellen around the auditorium as the biggest names in 
Tinseltown grabbed slices and chowed down. He reportedly received a $150
 tip off the $1,000 check.

That tip was given before Pharrell's hat 
from an earlier performance was passed around to audience members asking
 for more money.

The collection netted $300 and some lip balm, but TMZ reported it is not known if he will see that extra dough.

But the publicity coup is thought to be worth about $10million to the pizza chain.

A TMZ reporter staked out at the pizzeria filmed fellow employees congratulating him and cheering as he returned triumphantly from the ceremony.

The light-hearted moment set Twitter ablaze, with fans tweeting that they recognised their local delivery guy.

'Big Mama's & Papa's pizza!!! I order from them all the time! That's my delivery guy!,' tweeted Jason with the handle @garmonbozia shortly after seeing the familiar face.

Others took to the social Twitter and Facebook to find out who the delivery man was.

Ellen told the celebrity-studded audience that she had a vegetable pizza with tomato sauce, a cheese pizza and other different kinds.

'I've never done this before, you help,' Ellen asked the delivery guy who proceeded to offer slices to the stars.

When Ellen asked who wanted a slice several famous hands immediately shot up.

'No worries on the pizza peeps! I'm gluten-free! LOL #SnacksInMyPurse #Oscars' she tweeted to her more than one million followers on Twitter.

The Scandal star later was spotted behind the stage enjoying a gluten-free slice and shared a photo on Instagram.
