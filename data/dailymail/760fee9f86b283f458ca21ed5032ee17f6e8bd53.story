Princess Charlene and Prince Albert II of Monaco are expecting twins.

The royal family will grow by two when the Princess, 36, gives birth at the end of this year, leading many to speculate which baby will inherit the principality.

The couple first announced in May that they were expecting. 

A crown fit for two? Princess Charlene and Prince Albert II of Monaco are expecting twins - which has led many to speculate which baby will inherit the throne

According to the Constitution of the Principality, the first born baby is the closest in line to the throne, with priority given to males. What remains unclear is what will happen if the first born is a girl.

In 2002, when Albert was still single, his father Prince Rainier quietly changed Monaco's constitutional laws to allow his daughters, Caroline and Stephanie, and their children to inherit the throne should Albert fail to marry and produce an heir.

Charlene, a former Olympic swimmer from South Africa, married the Monegasque royal in July 2011. 

In June, Prince Albert told The Associated Press that he and his wife were 'overjoyed', 'thrilled' and 'very excited' about the impending arrival of their child - or children, as it is now known.

He said they are 'taking every cautious step to make sure everything goes well'.

Albert, now 56, was a longtime bachelor who has acknowledged fathering two children out of wedlock - daughter Jazmin Grace Grimaldi, born in 1992 to American Tamara Rotolo, and Alexandre Coste, born in 2003 to Togo native Nicole Coste.

While neither is in line to the throne, they are entitled to a portion of their father's fortune, which is said to be about $1billion.

Rumors began swirling that twins were a possibility when fans noticed that the official birth announcement did not specify a number of children.

'T.S.H the Prince and the Princess of Monaco are delighted to announce the pregnancy of H.S.H. Princess Charlene,' read the announcement.

And a few days later, on May 30, South African journalist Derek Watts tweeted: 'My old bulawayo schoolmate mike wittstock has phoned to say his daughter is pregnant with twins. Congrats princess charlene and albert!' 

Mr Watts subsequently deleted the tweet, leading many to believe that he had unintentionally let the cat out of the bag too soon.

Prince Rainier III, whose wife was Grace Kelly, ruled the Principality of Monaco for 56 years before passing away in 2005. 

Under inheritance laws, neither of Prince Albert's two illegitimate children have any claim to royal titles and are not considered his official heirs.

His daughter Jazmin was born in California to a former waitress with whom Prince Albert had a brief fling. Now 22, she recently graduated from Fordham University in New York.

His son Alexandre, now ten, lives with his mother, a former Air France hostess from Togo, on the French Riviera.

Prince Albert reportedly demanded DNA tests for both children before accepting paternity.

Another recent case of an aristocratic figure having twin heirs was in 2009, when David Cholmondeley, 54, the seventh Marquess of Cholmondeley, welcomed twin boys with his wife Rose Hanbury, 29, a former fashion model.

Born by C-section three months premature, the boys were named Alexander Hugh George and Oliver Timothy George.

Older by a few minutes, Alexander is the heir-apparent to the Marquessate and bears the courtesy title Earl of Rocksavage because doctors pulled him out first.

Oliver is known as Lord Cholmondeley and the brothers will have different last names.

Alexander, who goes by Xan, stands to inherit the historic castle Houghton Hall as well as Cholmondeley Castle, which is surrounded by 7,500 acres.

Oliver, being second son, missed out.

As of 2008, David Cholmondeley had an estimated net worth of £60million, or $96.5million. 

Alexandre's mother told the Mail On Sunday in April that while he began as a loving and supportive father - albeit from afar - Albert's interest in his son has waned since he began a relationship with his now-wife. 

'The truth is that, I'm sorry to say, Albert hasn’t seen Alexandre since a brief visit last September,' she claimed. 'It has become impossible since he married that girl.'

In 2005, Prince Albert said in an interview with Larry King that while Alexandre will never inherit the throne, 'he will be very well taken care of' - presumably financially.

While it's rare for a noble figure to have twin heirs, it has happened before - most recently in 2009, when David Cholmondeley, the seventh Marquess of Cholmondeley, welcomed twin boys with his wife Rose Hanbury, a former fashion model 23 years his junior.

Born by C-section three months premature, the boys were named Alexander Hugh George and Oliver Timothy George.

Older by a few minutes, Alexander is the heir-apparent to the Marquessate and bears the courtesy title Earl of Rocksavage. Oliver is known as Lord Cholmondeley. 

As of 2008, David Cholmondeley had an estimated net worth of £60million, or $96.5million.
