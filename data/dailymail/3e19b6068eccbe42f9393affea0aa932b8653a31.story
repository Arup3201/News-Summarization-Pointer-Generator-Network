These extraordinary images detail the remarkable similarities between humans and our closest living relatives, bonobos.

Sharing 98.7 per cent of human DNA, the fascinating creatures exhibit the same expressions, mannerisms and behaviour as man displays on a daily basis.

From turning taps on and off for a drink to cuddling their babies, the great apes are the closest thing to observing a human in a zoo - even suffering hair loss.

Remarkable: Photographs of our closest living species show just how similar they are to us, sharing 98.7 per cent of DNA

Close inspection: The fascinating creatures exhibit the same expressions, mannerisms and behaviour as man displays on a daily basis

Their natural habitat is the Congo basin, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where they suffer horrendous atrocities and are currently listed as endangered.

Wildlife photographer Graham McGeorge, 42, captured these magnificent moments at Jacksonville Zoo, in Florida, USA, where he has become gripped with how the young bonobos grow up.

Intelligent: From turning taps on and off for a drink to cuddling their babies the great apes are the closest thing to observing a human in a zoo

Affection: It's hard not to wonder what the bonobos are thinking when we see them displaying similar actions to ourselves, such as a mother cradling a youngster

Relaxing: Their natural habitat is the Congo basin in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where they suffer horrendous atrocities and are currently listed as endangered. This troop was photographed from their home in a Florida zoo

Fascinating: Wildlife photographer Graham McGeorge, 42, captured these magnificent moments at Jacksonville Zoo in Florida, where he has become gripped with watching how the young bonobos grow up

Graham, originally from Dumfries, Scotland, but now living about 10 miles from the zoo said: 'I have been observing them for close to five years - mostly when I'm not travelling as it's so close to me.

'I instantly grew attached to the Bonobos as they are fascinating primates - it has become almost an on-going study watching them grow up and get older and how they learn their mannerisms.

Embrace: A young bonobo gazes into the camera while being embraced in a bear-hug by an affectionate adult

Ageing: A youngster sits protected by a a circle of adults and adolescents, left, while right, an older bonobo, who's head hair has fallen out, sits alone

Companionship: The bonobos huddle together as they snooze in the early morning sun

Routine: Even the little ones get groomed by the adults as part of their daily routine

'The babies are just like human babies, very comical, playing and fighting between each other. The mannerisms are just so close to the way we act - there is only one chromosome difference between us and you can really see it.

'Until they are five or six-years-old they have childhood characteristics whereas the adults are more chilled as we are sitting back watching their young play together.

The youngsters were often watching the adults and being taught new tricks, such as turning the tap on and off

Observing: The primates seem content to simply watch each other, in between eating, grooming, sleeping and playing

Wildlife photographer Graham McGeorge, is fascinated by observing the behaviour of our closest living species, especially how the young Bonobos are reared

'They know when and pay attention to humans as you show up - it's when the babies start showing off when they know people are paying them attention just like human children.

'They're not a well-known primate most people think of chimpanzees but I got interested in them and then I did my research and it kind of grew from there.'
