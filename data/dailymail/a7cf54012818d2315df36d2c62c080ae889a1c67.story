Manchester City will offer Sergio Aguero a mammoth £52million deal to commit himself to the Barclays Premier League champions until 2019.

Aguero already collects £200,000-a-week and will be offered the increased deal via a series of huge bonuses - which must fall in line UEFA’s Financial Fair Play rules.

He scored 17 league goals in 23 appearances last season and the champions are keen to keep him at the Etihad beyond the end of his current deal which ends in 2017.
