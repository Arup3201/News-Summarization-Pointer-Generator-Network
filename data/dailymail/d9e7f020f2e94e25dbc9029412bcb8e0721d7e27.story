This was a point celebrated wildly by the 2,600 Wales fans inside the King Baudoiun Stadium. A shirts off, flag-waving party spurred by trance music blaring from the sound system.

Gareth Bale went topless too, chucking his yellow jersey into the crowd along with Ashley Williams, Aaron Ramsey and others.

Usually such scenes of euphoria are reserved for cup final victories and relegation survivals. Rarely have they been preceded by a 0-0 draw. But it was understandable, Wales had come to the nation ranked fourth in the world, their toughest destination on the road to qualification for Euro 2016, and left with their unbeaten record still intact.

It appeared for a fleeting moment at the death like it was being snatched away, when Christian Benteke’s header was saved by Wayne Hennessey and caused havoc in the six-yard area. Axel Witsel got a touch to divert the ball towards the Welsh net but as it rolled Bale, of all people, arrived to clear from danger.

That swing of the boot, in the sixth minute of injury time, was just as important as any he has delivered at the other end of the pitch for his country. A star player scrapping it out.

The lengthy added time came due to Dries Mertens needing treatment after being knocked out by an accidental collision with George Williams. He left on a stretcher only 16 minutes after coming on.

Joe Allen required medical attention earlier in the second half, when Marouane Fellaini led a dangerous forearm into his face in a tussle for the ball. Allen had seemingly irritated the Manchester United midfielder by knocking him down five minutes beforehand.

Lucky for Fellaini the only red came from Allen’s lip, which was still bleeding as the Liverpool player boarded the team coach. He played down the incident, as did his manager.

It will be sore heads of a different kind this morning for those Welsh fans who crossed the Channel, sunk beer in the bars of Brussels during the day, and continued to do so into the night.

It really was an immense release of energy from that section of this great bowl of a ground when the final whistle sounded. The point was secured by totemic defending from captain Ashley Williams and James Chester, who is growing into his role in this team. Time and again the pair of centre-backs weathered Belgian attacks, clearing and heading all that came their way.

It was by no means a Belgian onslaught, thanks to Allen’s fine work in midfield, and Bale went close with two free-kicks and a trademark run and shot. Chris Coleman will be pleased, too, about the nous used at certain moments. True, this was not an expansive display but he wants his players to be streetwise when they are unable to show style.

‘It's a fantastic result,’ said Bale. ‘I think we started a bit slow, but in the second half we showed a bit of character and true courage – that’s massive for us. The fans were incredible.’

His clearance? ‘You have to do those things! Everyone will do everything and we all work for each other.’

Wales now have eight points from four games, the kind of ratio that will get Coleman’s side to France and a first major tournament since 1958.

Bale had the first chance, in the 14th minute, sizing up a free-kick from 25 yards and striking over the wall. Thibaut Courtois sprang to his left to palm wide.

That sparked Belgium’s best period. Eden Hazard dribbled through three Wales defenders and brought a good save from Hennessey.

The Crystal Palace goalkeeper, unwanted by Neil Warnock, made an even better one minutes later, racing from his line to deny Nacer Chadli after Divock Origi’s clever flick set him clear. Nicolas Lombaerts then cracked a shot against the post from a corner and as the ball rebounded it hit Origi and trickled wide.

But in the second half Belgium, World Cup quarter-finalists last summer, were subdued for long periods and Wales had the better chances.

Bale rekindled memories of his 2010 hat-trick in the San Siro with a run down the left and shot from a tight angle. The ball whistled wide. Hal Robson-Kanu then tested Courtois from range.

‘Belgium have players who can create chances from nothing so we knew we had to ride our luck a little bit,’ said Coleman. ‘But we were stubborn and it was a courageous performance.

‘The momentum is there. That team in 2002 was a hell of a good team, littered with Premier League players. The front three was (John) Hartson, (Craig) Bellamy and (Ryan) Giggs – that's not bad – but we never did it.’

The challenge now for Wales is to make this result worthwhile and give those supporters something seismic to celebrate.
