Identical twin sisters thought they were seeing double when they cooked a fry-up - and cracked open four double-yolk eggs.

Suzanne Robinson and Sandra Rowe, 51, were making poached eggs with bacon on toast for their family when they cracked open the first double yolker.

But they went on to crack open three more 'twin eggs' all with bonus yolks and said the odds-defying experience made their get-together more special.

Identical twins Suzanne and Sandra were shocked to discover that they had found four double-yolk eggs

The twins cracked four double yolks in a row which bookies put at a chance of 100,000 to one

Bookies said the chances of finding four double yolk eggs in a row is 100,000 to one.

Sandra said: 'Suzanne decided on poached eggs for breakfast and when she cracked open the first egg she called us over and said "it's a twin egg".

'But then it happened again, and then again and again until we had four. It made for quite a special picture and it was a pretty funny thing to happen.

'I've heard of it happening once in my life but never four times in a row, and it was especially unusual as we are twins. We were all quite shocked.'

Suzanne and Sandra are identical twins and said that they found their discovery 'shocking'

Sandra was visiting her sister in Ireland when they made the discovery as they cooked breakfast

Sandra, of Worcester Park, Surrey, was visiting her foster carer sister in Athy, County Kildare, Ireland, with her partner David Boardman, a surgeon, and his daughter Amelia, 11.

The free range eggs were in a six-pack from Tesco. 'It made our weekend even more special,' Sandra added.

A spokesman for William Hill said: 'In the history of double eggs this is without a doubt the most surprising we have heard of.

'Glad we did not offer odds in advance or we would have egg on our face!'

Sandra Rowe and Suzanne Robinson are identical twins and have always been close
