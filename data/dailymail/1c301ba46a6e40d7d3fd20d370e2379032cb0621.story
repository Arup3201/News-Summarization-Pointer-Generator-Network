Jewish communities around the world put on a colourful display over the weekend to celebrate the festival of Purim.

The carnival-like holiday is marked by parades and costume parties with participants dressing up in masks and fancy dress outfits.

The holy day commemorates the salvation of the Jewish people in ancient Persia during the 5th century BC when Royal adviser Haman plotted 'to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews, young and old, infants and women, in a single day'.

The ancient story is recorded in the book of Esther in the Hebrew Bible and tells how a royal adviser to King Ahasuerus - presumed to be Xerxes I of Persia - called Haman planned to kill all the Jews in the empire. But his plans were foiled by Mordecai and his adopted daughter Queen Esther.

Huge celebrations are held around the world and Orthodox children - from Stamford Hill to Tel Aviv - donned fancy dress outfits, ranging from penguins to cowboys to musketeers.

Purim is celebrated annually on the 14th day of the Hebrew month of Adar - the day following the victory over the plot. It is the one day of the year where Jewish people are encouraged to get 'shikker' - a Yiddish term for extremely drunk - and to eat, drink and be merry.

Drunkenness is usually discouraged by Jewish law but it is considered a mitzvah - religious duty - to drink alcohol on Purim although followers are still expected to perform all other duties of the festival.

As well as parades and fancy dress, Purim is celebrated by the giving of food and drink to other Jews and through charity to the poor.

In Tel Aviv the gay community wore elaborate costumes, including a couple dressed as Israeli soldiers and one man dressed as a Persian princess.
