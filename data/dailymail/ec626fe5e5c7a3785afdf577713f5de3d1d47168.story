Salford owner Marwan Koukash and Liverpool-born actor David Morrissey have teamed up to bring a Palestinian refugee to England to improve his rugby league skills.

Khaled Issa, 20, will spend 10 days with the Red Devils, training with both the first team and the academy, and hopes to play a game before returning home.

Issa, whose family fled to Beirut in Lebanon as refugees, was discovered by the founder of Palestinian Rugby League, Rabie Al Masri, who has been training Palestinian refugees since 2008 and so far has gathered 80 players to form three teams.

Al Masri said: 'We wanted Khaled to go to Salford Red Devils to have a great experience with a big professional team and I hope he will learn a lot to bring back and pass on to the Palestinian players.

'It is a dream for him to be visiting England and to be part of Salford Red Devils and we hope Khaled will have a great time.'

Koukash, who was also a former Palestinian refugee, said: 'I am a very proud that we have been able to set up these links with the Palestinian RL and I really do hope that projects like this will not only encourage the development of the game internationally but also more importantly give young kids such as Khaled a real life-changing opportunity.'

Red Riding and Walking Dead actor Morrissey, who is a friend of the Salford owner and met Issa during one of his regular trips to Beirut, has also helped to finance the trip.

Issa captained the Palestinian Under-16 team in 2010.
