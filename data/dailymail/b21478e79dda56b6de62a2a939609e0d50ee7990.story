A Marine already in custody in the theft of an assault weapon was booked Tuesday on suspicion of murder in the death of another Marine's wife, authorities said.

The latest allegation against Louis Ray Perez came a week after the body of 22-year-old Brittany Killgore was found in brush near a Southern California lake.

Sheriff's investigators identified the 45-year-old Perez as a person of interest shortly after the body was discovered.

The San Diego County district attorney's office said the case was under review.

Another suspect, Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, pleaded not guilty to murder last week in Killgore's death. She is being held on $3 million bail.

Authorities have not said whether Lopez and Perez knew each other or whether they knew the victim.

Jeff Reichert, Perez's attorney, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Perez has been in the military for 16 years, has no criminal history, is married and has lived in the San Diego area for about 10 years, Reichert said in court last week. He is being held on $500,000 bail in Vista, north of San Diego.

Only hours earlier, a 'person of interest' in the murder of marine's wife Brittany Kilgore left a series of bizarre postings on a depraved BDSM sex website.

Perez, 47, who is also a Marine, used to live in Fallbrook, California, with his girlfriend and made posts on the website BMEHookups.com about wanting to find another 'sex slave' to join his home.

Jessica Lynn Lopez, who has been charged with murder in Mrs Killgore's death, currently lives with Perez's girlfriend.

The families of both Mrs Killgore, 22, and Lopez, 25, both vehemently deny that the two were linked with Perez's sex ring.

Internet outlet: Perez's girlfriend posted several messages on the website TSRnetwork.com

However, in a posting on another BDSM website, TSRnetwork.com, Perez's girlfriend wrote: 'We have a poly home in which I own two slave girls. Life is good,' the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.

Poly refers to 'polyamorous,' an alternative 'open' relationship style with multiple sexual partners.

Authorities have not said what led Lopez to allegedly kill Mrs Killgore and Perez has not been formally implicated in her death.

Perez is currently in jail after he was arrested for possessing an assault rifle stolen from nearby Camp Pendleton, where he had served for 10 years. He is not cooperating with police, the Union-Tribune reports.

On BME Hookups, a website devoted to matching connecting people with kinky sex fetishes, Perez, who used the online alias 'Ivan' wrote: 'I am lord and master, dom and daddy of my house. My slave, Ms. Dee, is a slave to no one, but myself.'

His 36-year-old girlfriend described herself as 'an alpha slave to master Ivan.'

Perez posted several photos of himself and his girlfriend on the website and said he was looking for another woman to join his home.

Mrs Killgore was married to Cory Killgore, a Marine who was recently deployed overseas to Afghanistan.

Mrs Killgore, it was revealed, maintained a blog years ago where she wrote about fears about marriage and divorce.

In the blog titled 13smyfavoritenumber, Killgore, whose nude body was discovered on Tuesday, wrote about her insecurities and how she suffered from depression, according to NBC San Diego.

‘im so insecure sometimes its not even funny (sic),’ she wrote aged 17, adding that she had recently stopped taking anti-depressants.

She also told how she was worried 
about getting married because of the high divorce rates. Tragically, 
Killgore had filed for divorce from her Marine husband Cory Killgore the
week before she went missing.

When responding to a question about 
whether she wanted to get married, Killgore wrote in 2007: ‘i want to 
be, but … i want to love that person. the divorce rate is so high its 
sad.’

In other postings, Killgore revealed 
she did not get on with her family and was looking forward to moving out
and going to college.

‘im planning to move out its very 
difficult. i dont get along with my family all that well i think it will
be better when i move out. my sister and i have gotten closer though, 
its actully realy weird,’ she said

The blog comes to light as the woman accused of killing the young wife pleaded not guilty to murder charges on Thursday.

Prosecutors offered no details of the
motive Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, had to allegedly harm Killgore, whose 
body was discovered in brush near a lake in San Diego, California.

However, Lopez's neighbor claims she and Mrs Killgore were involved in a dangerous sex ring, playing sex slaves.

A
second Marine, Louis Ray Perez, who has been named a person of 
interest, has not been charged with the murder. He is currently in jail,
facing charges he stole an assault rifle.

Lopez was discovered with the note in a San Diego hotel room, 
prosecutor Patrick Espinoza said. No further details were released about
the note.

Authorities said earlier this week 
that paramedics hospitalized Lopez after finding her with self-inflicted
cuts in the room but didn't disclose the suicide note. Within hours of 
finding Lopez, searchers discovered the body of Killgore.

Bail for Lopez was set at $3 million at her arraignment in Vista Superior Court, north of San Diego.

Lopez's
attorney Dean Broyles said he didn't know if his client knew Perez or 
Mrs Killgore, who was reported missing Saturday -- one day after Lopez 
turned 25.

'There's a lot of speculation, a lot of innuendo, a lot of weak allegations and charges out there,' he said.

'I would caution everyone to not jump to conclusions and prejudge based on all the information flying around right now.'

Mr
Broyles said Lopez would ask the judge for a public defender after her 
family sought his help in fielding media questions. Lopez's parents, who
live in nearby Escondido, released a statement saying they loved their 
daughter.

'We pray for the 
family of Brittany Killgore and ask that the Lord comfort them during 
their time of grief and anguish,' the parents said. 'We ask that you pray for all of those impacted by this tragic situation, including our family.'

Authorities have not disclosed Mrs Killgore, Lopez, and Perez are connected.

A neighbour, who declined to be identified, told ABC 10 that both Lopez and the victim took part in some kind of sex ring, saying: 'They're into the sex slave things... I try not to judge, but that's what they're into.'

Perez, 45, pleaded not guilty 
on Wednesday to stealing a AR-15 rifle from Camp Pendleton. Investigators have given few 
details about that case, and it was not known if they suspect the weapon
was tied to Killgore's death.

Perez was being held on $500,000 
bond. His attorney Jeffrey Reichert said his client has no criminal 
history, is married and has lived in San Diego County for 10 years.

Mrs Killgore went missing shortly after 
filing for divorce from her husband, Cory Killgore a 22-year-old Marine deployed to 
Afghanistan.

Her body was found in brush near Lake Skinner in Riverside 
County about 25 miles northeast of her modest, two-story apartment in 
Fallbrook, a San Diego County community known for its avocado orchards.

Killgore lived a short walk from an 
entrance to Camp Pendleton, and her complex - like others around it - is
full of Marines and their families who tend to be short-term residents 
and often don't get to know each other well.

Killgore's husband, Lance Corporal 
Cory Killgore, flew back to California after learning his wife was
missing. Sheriff's authorities say he is not a suspect.

The couple from Missouri were married
in July 2010. Brittany Killgore filed for divorce April 10 and listed 
'irreconcilable differences' as the reason. She gave no details on the 
paperwork.

Her cellphone was found in the Gaslamp District of downtown San Diego, an area populated with bars and restaurants.

Darryl J Wrest of Rolla, Missouri, 
confirmed Brittany Killgore is his daughter but said he was not 
commenting on anything at this time.

Authorities investigating the homicide said a suicide note
of the prime suspect contained key details about the case, including 
the location of a body.

ABC 10 reported that officers later responded to a Ramada Inn near the San Diego Airport, 
where they found a woman with stab wounds all over her body in an 
apparent suicide attempt.

That woman, 27-year-old Lopez, was arrested at the scene but hospitalised at UCSD Medical Center.

She was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday, and charged with murder in Killgore's death.

Cory Killgore was deployed to Afghanistan earlier this year as a vehicle operator.
