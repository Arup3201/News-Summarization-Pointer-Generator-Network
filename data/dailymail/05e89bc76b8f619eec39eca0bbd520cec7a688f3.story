A generation fell in love with Felicity Kendal as dungaree-wearing Barbara Good in TV’s The Good Life. And today, at 67, she still radiates sex appeal.  

This week she revealed: ‘I haven’t done fillers or Botox for ages. There comes a point where you have to match bits of you with the other bits, otherwise you get a terribly random situation.’

It was wise to call a halt to the Botox. But, given her enduring looks just how intense was the work Felicity’s had? Here, we reveal the effort that created this sensational 60-something from a promising young starlet .

She may have given up Botox now, but that enviably smooth forehead is the beneficiary of regular past injections, as Felicity has admitted. Treatments are recommended between every three and six months.

It seems Felicity’s long had a love-hate relationship with Botox. In an interview three years ago, she said that she had stopped having the procedure in 2010, but was thinking about going back to it once more. ‘I might have it again soon,’ she said. ‘It’s nice not to have lines when you frown, especially on TV. I don’t know why people make such a fuss about it. No one is interested if a woman has her  teeth capped or her hair dyed.’

Now, though, she says she has quit for good.

It may be enviably firm, but Felicity attributes her youthful jawline to great genes because her mother also looked young right into her 70s. She also keeps her weight under control with yoga.

As for a much rumoured facelift, Felicity denies all, saying that she visited Dr Laurence Kirwan only once, for Botox around ten years ago, and didn’t like the results so didn’t return to his clinic.

Felicity has admitted having fillers — to plump out nose-to-mouth lines as well as those around the eyes — in her cheeks, but without success.

‘Don’t have fillers when your cheekbones are high! It’s chipmunk time!’ She added: ‘The only thing to do eventually is the full thing [a facelift] but you have to do that when you’re 40.’

No squinting around the delicate eye area for Felicity. She had severe astigmatism for years, which meant that she needed to use a magnifying glass to apply her make-up. Then, fed up of the squinting, she had a lens implant in 2009.

She later said: ‘I see more now than I ever did before. It’s the most magical operation in the world — you go from being blind to actually seeing.’

Naturally brunette, Felicity has been blonde and had essentially the same flicky, layered style for four decades and counting.

Blonde bombshell: For many years, she has been a loyal client of the five-star Mayfair salon Michaeljohn

For many years, she has been a loyal client of the five-star Mayfair salon Michaeljohn, where she has it coloured and cut in a process which she complains takes more than two hours.

Other Michaeljohn devotees have included Cherie Blair, Mick Jagger and Dustin Hoffman.

Those perfect pins of Felicity’s are kept slender by strict regular exercise and a lifetime of yoga. She says that she remembers watching her mother, who ran a Shakespeare touring company in India, doing her yoga exercises when she was a small girl.

Felicity said: ‘I used to exercise for three hours a week doing Pilates and weights. Now I have to do five or six hours to get the same result.’

Felicity was named Rear of the Year in 1981, no less, and has kept a shapely figure thanks to exercise and an active sex life, saying: ‘It’s part of life, like eating or breathing.’

She said that her experience in Strictly in 2010 — in which she stunned viewers by doing the splits — made her famous rear more pert than ever because she was dancing for six or more hours a day.

Michael Rudman — the theatre director whom she married, divorced and is dating again — goes to the gym three or four times a week with her. Felicity says he is far more health conscious than her.

Eternally trim, Felicity has always watched her weight, briefly going on a diet of nothing but seaweed in her 20s. Lunch is often just a bowl of Thai vegetable soup and a cup of coffee.

‘As for junk food, if I’d ever walked down the road eating anything, my father would have clouted me,’  she said.

In 2009, she said: ‘I used to diet when I was younger because one wants to be skinny, but I don’t diet any more. I eat quite healthily. I don’t like stodgy food, so I am a salad, pasta and steak girl.’

Any vices? Well, she allows herself a couple of glasses of red wine and a sneaky cigarette if she feels like it.

Felicity has confessed to being ‘rock chick’ at heart and had her first tattoo – a star on her foot representing her younger son, Jacob, 27, a fledgling criminal barrister — at the relatively late age of 63. A year later, she had a moon surrounded by feathers inscribed on her calf, which symbolises her elder son, Charley, and his two children. She’s now considering a third.

Felicity spent her childhood in India, and the cosmetic legacy is still apparent today in the sun damage you can see on her chest.

Brown spots and wrinkles pepper her decolletage and hands.

But her face, by contrast, is as smooth and pure  as silk.

How? Well, she’s confessed to having Polaris laser treatment on her face to combat the sun damage. It was administered by Dr Jean Louis Sebagh at a cost of around £200 a time.

‘It’s really quite painful,’ she told an interviewer. ‘But it takes off brown spots and makes skin finer.’

Devotees have to go back every three months to keep their skin looking peachy. 

Enjoying the sunshine: On holiday with her family

One wonders whether Felicity will extend the treatment to her body, too, to stop the mismatch effect.

She’s also a fan of lathering on face cream, recently graduating from ‘good old Nivea’ to the pricey cult beauty favourite Creme de La Mer, which costs £103 for a tiny 30ml pot.

She said: ‘I don’t wear a great deal of make-up, but I use lots of cream. I love Clarins After-Sun, which smells lovely — like a holiday in a tube — and is very nourishing.’
