A pair of sick Persian cats has been left homeless after being dumped at the gates of an animal charity in Devon.

Bluebell and Snowdrop were discovered in a pet carrier by staff at the Woodside Animal Welfare Trust in Plymouth on July 5 and in need of dental treatment and medical attention for an eye condition which has left them looking particularly sorry for themselves.

It comes just a month after four other Persians were abandoned at the sanctuary including Queenie, Jubilee and Regina who are still looking for new homes.

A helping hand: Staff at Woodside Animal Welfare Trust including Debbie Haynes (pictured here with Snowdrop) are appealing to anyone with information about the homeless cats

Bluebell and Snowdrop will join the search Lisa Darcy, assistant manager at Woodside said.

‘They
were in a similar state of ill-health, all needing medical attention 
including dental treatment and eye operations, as were four Persians 
left here around four weeks ago.

‘We are appealing to anyone who has information about these abandoned cats, whether they are pets or belong to a breeder.’

Woodside is a sanctuary for healthy and sick animals including dogs, cats, rabbits and goats.

They encourage responsible pet ownership and do send welfare officers into deprived areas to help owners understand their pet’s needs and promote the charity’s spray and neuter scheme which has prevented thousands of unwanted litters over the years.

If you can re-home these cats, or have any information on where they have come from, contact Woodside on 01752 347503.
