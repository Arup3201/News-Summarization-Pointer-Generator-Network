President Barack Obama finally broke his silence this morning on the problems plaguing his administration's Veterans Affairs Department.

The president said he 'will not stand' for allegations of misconduct. 'Not as Commander in Chief, but also not as an American. None of us should,' he said.

Obama called VA Secretary Eric Shinseki 'a great public servant and a great warrior on behalf of the United States of America.'

'We're gonna work with him to solve the problem,' Obama said, confirming that he had not asked Shinseki for his resignation.

However the president said he would wait to see the results of the VA's internal report before making any decisions about the future of the beleaguered agency.

As Commander in Chief, 'the responsibility for things always rests ultimately with me,' Obama said.

As Commander-in-Chief, 'the responsibility for things always rests ultimately with me,' Obama said on Wednesday

The president held a rare press conference and addressed his administration's efforts to sort out the VA mess, but he only took two reporters' questions

The president's remarks followed a last minute 
meeting with Shinseki and White House Deputy Chief of 
Staff Rob Nabors.

Nabors is overseeing an internal 
review of the VA's operations in light of allegations that 40 veterans died after staff at a VA facility in Phoenix, Arizona put them on secret waiting lists to cover up how long it was taking them to receive care.

The president said he expects to see a preliminary report from Nabors on the secret waiting lists next week and full report next month on 'how the VA can up their game.'

Before Obama's 10 am meeting with Shinseki even began, the White 
House announced that the president would make a statement at 10.45 am 
directly after, leading observers to believe the president may be asking for Shinseki's resignation during their meeting.

The
 White House had already forced Under Secretary of Health for the VA, 
Robert Petzel, to abruptly resign last Friday after his lackluster performance a day before at a Senate Veterans Affairs hearing.

Petzel
 was already set to retire this year, but the White House forced him out 
early, sensing that someone's head needed to roll over the alleged 
misconduct at VA hospitals.

Even as Petzel's employment with the VA was terminated early, the White House stood by Shinseki, who has repeatedly said he's not going to step down.

'The president supports Secretary Shinseki’s decision,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said on Friday.

Obama reiterated that support during his press conference today, fondly referring to Shinseki by his nickname, 'Rick,' throughout his remarks.

'Across the board, he has put his heart and soul into this thing, and he has taken it very seriously,' Obama said.

Secretary Shinseki serves the country because 'he cares very deeply about veterans, and he cares deeply about the mission,' Obama said.

'And I know that Rick, his attitude is, if he does not think he can do a good job on this, and if he thinks he's let our veterans down, then I am sure that he is not gonna be interested in committing to serve,' he continued.

'At this stage, Rick is committed to solving the problem, and working with us to do it.'

The president said during his prepared remarks that he has been inspired by wounded veterans' 'spirit and their determination to recover and often to serve.'

'These men and women are the best that our country has to offer,' Obama said.

'So when I hear allegations of misconduct - any misconduct,' he said, 'whether it's allegations of VA staff covering up long wait times or cooking the books, I will not stand for it. Not as Commander in Chief, but also not as an American. None of us should.

'So, if these allegations prove to be true, it is dishonorable. It is disgraceful, and I will not tolerate it period.'

'Once we know the facts, I assure you, if there is misconduct, it will be punished,' Obama said.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell immediately criticized the president for not taking a heavier hand.

'A crisis of the magnitude facing the VA on providing care to our veterans
demands clear leadership from President Obama,' McConnell said. 'Unfortunately, so far I have yet
to hear from the president that he is treating the VA crisis with the
seriousness it deserves.'

Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus raised similar questions about the president's decision not to act yet given recent reports that his team has known for five years that VA hospitals were falsifying records to make it look like veterans were waiting for care for shorter periods of time than they actually were.

'Why did President Obama wait to address this situation only to ask our veterans for more time and to offer nothing but words?' Preibus said in a statement.

'We've known about these problems for weeks—facilities cooking their books, veterans dying while waiting for an appointment and bonuses being handed out to those in charge. The Administration, we now know, has known about them even longer.'

Anyone who 
is found to be guilty of the allegations will  be held 
accountable, Obama promised during his remarks, and called on both Republicans and Democrats to work together and not let the scandal 'become another political football.'

'If somebody’s engaged in mismanagement or misconduct, not
 only do I not want them getting bonus, I want them punished,' Obama said.

He pointed out that the individuals involved 
in creating the secret wait lists at the Phoenix VA hospital at the 
center of the scandal have already been put on administrative leave.

'I
 know that people are angry and want swift reckoning. I sympathize with 
that. But we have to let the investigators do they're job and get to the
 bottom of what happened,' the president added.

Obama said several times today that doesn't want to 'get ahead' 
of the internal review or any other investigations such as the report the VA Inspector General is working on.

The somewhat slow pace of the investigation into the secret wait list 'is not as a consequence 
people not caring about the problem,' it's that 85 million 
appointments are made through VA hospitals a year.

'That's a lot of appointments,' the president said.

The president said under his leadership, the VA made benefits available to two million veterans who did not have them before and expanded access to care for veterans with mental health issues and women veterans, all of which are positive developments, but also created stress on veterans health systems and contributed to wait times.

Based on the results of 
the investigation so far, the long appointment wait times were for 
'folks who may have had chronic conditions,' and 'it was not necessarily a situation where they were calling for emergency services,' the president said.

Furthermore, 'there
 are parts of the VA health care system that have performed well, ' Obama 
said, and the satisfaction rate of many veterans has been 
'high.'

The president admitted he did not know whether the secret wait lists were 'systemic' or if the Phoenix scandal was 'just an episodic problem.'

'There are going to be a lot of questions that we have to answer,' he concluded.
