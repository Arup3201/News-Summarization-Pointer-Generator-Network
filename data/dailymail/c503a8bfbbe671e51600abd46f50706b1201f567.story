Ray Hankin's pelicans follow him around the shop for hours a day

They're often Ray Hankin's first customers through the door and the last to leave at the end of the day, but they aren't people, they're pelicans.

Mr Hankin's bait and tackle shop at Forster, on the NSW mid-north coast, three hours north of Sydney, is anything but you're ordinary fishing store.

Not only is the Red Spot Boat Shed constantly inundated with keen anglers looking to buy the bait to their next catch, it's also being overrun by some eager and inquisitive pelicans eyeing off the delicious smorgasbord of tasty treats.

Mr Hankin said the pod of four pelicans have been walking through his door off and on ever since he began nursing an injured pelican, 'Heather,' back to good health a few years ago.

'She now follows me around the shop for hours each day,' he said.

'She might follow me in to the kitchen or just look outside the window to see what's going on.'

'Heather turned up crook and I nursed her back to health.

And she's not the only 'movie star' walking around in the bait and tackle shop, co-owned by Hankin and his ex-wife and business partner, Pi Sjostrom-Hankin.

The 57-year-old, whose business has become somewhat of a sanctuary for injured pelicans, also nursed a Pelican with a clipped wing back to health which had a 'sort of grey looking texture.'

Over the years there has also been 'Pat,' who had a bent nose similar to a friend of Mr Hankin's who died, and another with a broken wing he had to amputate.

Mr Hankin said when he saw 'Pelican Pat' turn up on his doorstep he thought it was a reincarnated version of his friend.

'We thought he had reincarnated as a pelican when he came to see me.'

Mr Hankin's visitors often squabble over who is going to be fed first

Mr Hankin, originally from Sydney, settled in Forster 30 years ago because he loved its laid back lifestyle, surf and was a mad fisherman.

'We used to always holiday in Forster, before I started the partnership in the business with my wife.'

'I always liked it here, always surfed and spent a few years travelling and surfing around the place.'

He said only in recent years has he invited pelicans to 'waltz into the shop'.

'They're sometimes just there waiting for me when I open the shop.'

Once through, they gaze at the smorgasbord of available baits as if looking at a menu in a restaurant waiting to be fed.

'Mullet is their favourite.' he said.

Asked if he ever gets sick of them walking around, he said: 'they can be like a child sometimes, they're a bit naughty'.

'The only time I really can keep them away is with the dogs, but I can assure you I do nothing to hurt them.'
