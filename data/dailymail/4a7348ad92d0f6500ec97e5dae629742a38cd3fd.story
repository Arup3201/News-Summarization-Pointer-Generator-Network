The mother of a 13-year-old dancer killed when their car was hit by a drug dealer chased by police, has spoken of her ‘unbearable’ grief over losing her daughter.

Wiktoria Was died instantly when 33-year-old Devon Newell crashed into the car she was travelling in with her mother, stepfather and four-year-old brother in Southwark, south-east London on January 6.

Her mother Anna Uroda said her life was ‘incomplete’ without her daughter adding: ‘I will be tortured for the rest of my life,’ Woolwich Crown Court heard today.

Year 9 pupil Wiktoria and her mother 
were travelling with her step-father Maciek Struzik and four-year-old 
brother Max Uroda at the time of the crash.

Drug dealer Newell, who did not have a
drivers licence, was trying to evade capture when he slammed into the 
back of the family’s VW Polo causing the car to spin violently onto the 
pavement and into a wall.

The court was shown police video that 
Newell had driven to speeds up to 70 miles per hour, sometimes three 
times the speed limits, going through red lights and swerving onto the 
other side of the road moments before the crash.

Seconds later, after his vehicle had 
spun 180 degrees into the other side of the road, he ran out of the car 
leaving his female passenger, Ms Brooks, in the passenger seat but he 
was soon caught by police officers.

Wiktoria was pronounced dead 20 
minutes later despite CPR from police and paramedics and emergency 
surgery carried out on the roadside.

Tragic: Wiktoria died in the crash in New Cross, south-east London on January 6

Injuries: Wiktoria was pronounced dead at the scene and her stepfather was taken to hospital

In a statement read out in court Ms 
Uroda said her daughter was ‘loveable, sensitive, trustworthy, happy, 
intelligent, hardworking and a sensible young girl full of life and 
blossoming into a beautiful blue-eyed young lady’.

The statement continued: ‘It breaks my
heart open with unbearable emotion, all purpose of life have become a 
mystery. How do I tell Max that he will never see his sister again? He 
says, ‘Where is Wiktoria? I want Wiktoria, I love Wiktoria.’

‘Without Wiktoria my life is incomplete, I will be tortured for the rest of my life for it. I face only darkness.

‘If only life had a stop and rewind button, Wiktoria would be with us safe and sound.’

The court was told that following the 
crash, Wiktoria’s little brother had been left traumatised suffering 
from night terrors and bedwetting.

Her stepfather had also suffered 
serious injuries and was awaiting physiotherapy for four fractures to 
the left side of his lumber vertebra but he had not been permanently 
disabled.

Newell, who pleaded guilty to one 
count of causing death by dangerous driving, one count of causing 
serious injury by dangerous driving and one summary count of driving 
without a licence and without insurance, had been bailed by Sussex 
Police for another offence in October of last year.

The court heard that he had a series 
of previous convictions including drug dealing and sexual offences and 
had never owned a full driving licence, having had his provisional one 
revoked in 1998.

‘It was driving characterised by ignoring obvious signals by police for him to stop’, said prosecutor Peter Clement.

‘The danger that he posed in driving the way that he did, deliberately ignoring the rules of the road, was obvious’

‘He demonstrated absolute disregard for the speed limits, traffic lights, or other road users.

‘In short, we suggest the defendant had regard only for himself.’

Sentencing him to a total of eight and
a half years, Judge Hilliard said: ‘This case represents a terrible 
tragedy and you are responsible for it. Because of your criminal 
conduct, 13-year-old Wiktoria Was was killed.

Her own life ended, all 
that promise, all those hopes for the future, all brought to an end and 
by you. Her mother, parents, her family, they have always got to live 
with that loss long after you have been released from the sentence I
will pass.

No sentence I pass will make up for what you have done. The 
sentence is not for one moment intended to reflect the value of human 
life, which of course is wholly beyond value.’

News of Wiktoria’s death prompted an outpouring of grief from her fellow pupils at Goffs School, in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire

Headteacher Alison Garner said immediately after the death that staff and pupils were still in shock after receiving the news.

‘Wiktoria was a highly valued member 
of our community - funny, charming, bubbly and with a bright future 
ahead of her’, she said.

‘She will be much missed by us all.’

In a statement on the school’s website Mrs Garner paid tribute to Wiktoria.

She said: ‘It was impossible to be in 
Wiktoria’s company without being struck by her wonderful personality and
humour, as well as her many talents, and her loss is felt deeply 
throughout our school.’

The family requested all Goffs School students wear their uniform to the funeral, as blue was Wiktoria’s favourite colour.

Following the funeral mass, the family attended a private cremation before returning to the Church Hall.
