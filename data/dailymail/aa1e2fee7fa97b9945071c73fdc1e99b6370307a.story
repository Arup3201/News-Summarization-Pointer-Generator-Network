A couple had to rescued by firefighters after getting trapped inside a lift - at their own wedding reception.

Emma and Christopher Hamilton were heading to their bridal suite with best man Jake Julian to drop off luggage when they got stuck.

As puzzled guests waited for them to return to their reception the trapped trio used the intercom to call for help.

Trapped: Emma Hamilton (centre) and husband Christopher (right) got stuck in a lift on their own wedding day along with best man Jake Julian (left) - and promptly started taking selfies

But rather than panicking, the trio passed the time taking a series of selfies as alternative wedding photos.

Firefighters freed them after half-an-hour and they were able to rejoin their celebrations at the Hotel Victoria in Newquay, Cornwall.

Mrs Hamilton said: 'I had the groom and best man with me and we were going up to the fourth floor when the lift stopped. We did not even make it to the first floor before we got stuck.

'We pressed the bell button on the lift and spoke to the reception who told us the fire brigade would be on their way. 

Fire crews were called to the Victoria Hotel in Newquay, Cornwall, after bride Emma and groom Christopher (right with their rescuers) hit the emergency button. Crews lowered the lift so they could climb out (left)

'I thought they were joking so we phoned a friend and to our surprise confirmed it was true. 

'We could not believe it was happening on our wedding day. We were supposed to be having our wedding photographs taken before sitting down for the meal but it was quite funny.

'The firefighters were brilliant. They had to cut the power off for the lift and lower us down by about six foot.

'We even had our photos taken with the fire crew so we could remember what happened on our wedding day.'

The pair tied the knot on August 8th after being together for four years.

Christopher, 27, is a scaffolder and his wife, 28, is a full time mother to their two children, Tylor, three, and one-year-old Charlie, who was also stuck inside the lift with them.

The family are from St Austell, Cornwall

Mrs Hamilton's grandmother Joan Parrish said: 'Emma and Christopher had a good laugh about what happened. They were not upset at all. 

All's well that ends well: Firefighters freed Emma and Christopher Hamilton, pictured,  after half-an-hour and they were eventually able to rejoin their celebrations

'People were saying where is Emma and Chris and we later discovered they were stuck in the lift.'

Richard Taylor, owner of the Hotel Victoria, said: 'Otis, the lift people, said the trip was activated, which could have been caused by jumping about in the lift.

'We are not allowed to free anyone from the lift and have to call the fire brigade. They came and released the occupants.

'They were very happy and had their photo with the fire brigade, which gave them good memories and photos for their wedding day.'
