Islamic State have released new shocking photos of a 'gay 'man being thrown off a roof and stoned to death.

Following a trial in an Islamic State court, the man was taken to the roof of the building and thrown to his death in front a large crowd below.

The horrific act was carried out in Tel Abiad in the Islamic State capital of Raqqa in Syria. 

Plummeting to his death: The unnamed man was accused of being homosexual and sentenced to death by an Islamic court in Raqqa.

The final act: The large crowd of men are shown hurling rocks at the victim's broken body. Local residents are also shown participating in the sickening scene.

The man is described as a ‘child of Lot’ and accused of committing acts of sodomy. 

Lot is referred to in the Bible and the Qur'an, where it is claimed the people of Sodom and Gomorrah carried out sinful acts and were severely punished by God. 

It is not the first occasion that Islamic State have published photos of such persecution. Another man accused of committing homosexual acts was thrown off the same building last month. 

Bearing witness: A large crowd of fighters and local residents of Raqqa is shown gathering to watch the horrific punishment outside the Islamic court building in Tal Abiad.
