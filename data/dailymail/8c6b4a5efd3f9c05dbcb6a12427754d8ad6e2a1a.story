Apps have become so cheap, fun and useful that they are actually becoming more popular than the internet, say statisticians.

Apps have actually overtaken the Web - the term for sites accessed via web browsers - in terms of the number of minutes users spend per day.

It's a huge change for the connected world.

A new report from Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project and the Imagining the Internet Center at North Carolina's Elon University says that Apps have actually changed the way we use the internet – and recent statistics back this up.

Web killer: There really is an app for just about everything

After all, these days, there really is an
app for everything, from smartphone downloads to keep you entertained 
such as Robo Surf to apps that find last-minute accommodation deals such
as Hotel Tonight.

Susan Crawford  a Harvard Professor and one of the report’s authors, said: ‘Apps are like cable channels - closed, proprietary, and cleaned-up experiences.

‘I don’t want the world of the Web to end like this. But it will, because people’s expectations have been shaped by companies that view them as consumers.

'Those giant interests will push every button they can - fear, inexperience, passivity, and willingness to be entertained. And we’ll get a cleaned-up world that we can be perfectly billed for. It’s not good.’

Meanwhile, last June, comScore, Alexa and Flurry Analytics measured apps as being viewed more than the Web for the very first time, with 81 minutes on average being spent on an app per day, compared to 74 minutes surfing.

Last December, the gap had grown to 94 minutes on apps compared to 72 minutes on the internet.

It’s a startling statistic – and the numbers associated with the app business have been hitting some huge landmarks recently.

Apple’s App Store hit the 10billion download mark in December, boasts 585,000 apps and receives more than one billion downloads a month, while Google Play (formerly Android Market) is fast catching up with 450,000 apps.

What’s more, apps have become increasingly big business, with Apple paying out £2.5bn to developers so far.
