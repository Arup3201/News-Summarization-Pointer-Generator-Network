A three-year-old girl may have had Winnie The Pooh ruined forever after she caught a woman and a man in a Tigger costume having sex in a public toilet.

The man, dressed as the beloved children's book character, and the woman, who was naked, had retreated to a public bathroom in Dawlish, Devon, when the little girl accidentally walked in on them.

The couple  then allegedly slammed the door shut so quickly, the three-year-old's hand was caught and the girl bruised her fingers. 

The wonderful thing about Tiggers: The three-year-old girl caught a man wearing a Tigger costume and a naked woman having sex in this public toiled in Dawlish, Devon

The couple had been spotted in the area earlier in the day, with the woman allegedly dressed as a leprechaun, celebrating Halloween with a large group of people.

The three-year-old and her mother were in a public bathroom in Dawlish, a town with a population of just under 13,000, as the couple were having sex in the baby changing room.  

The little girl's grandmother flagged up the incident on the neighbourhood police's Facebook, saying she was 'disgusted' that the event had taken place.

'My daughter took her young child to the toilets and there was a couple in the baby changing room having full blown sex,' angry Maryanne Saunders wrote.

Ta-ta for now! Local police said the man in the Tigger suit and his female companion has been tracked down and that 'strong words of advice have been administered'

'They slammed the door on my granddaughter's face and caught her hand in the door resulting in bruising to her fingers.

'This is not on, this is a disgusting act and in a baby changing room.'

Writing on Facebook, she added: 'They were about 30ish years old, the man had a Tigger outfit on, the woman was undressed.' 

Following and investigation into the incident, both man and woman have been traced. 

'Strong words of advice have been administered,' PCSO Deborah Sleeman of Devon and Cornwall Police said.
