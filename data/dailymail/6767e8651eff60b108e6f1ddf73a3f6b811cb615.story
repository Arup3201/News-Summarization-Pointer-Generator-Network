Late last month, it was announced the foundation searching for a site to establish Barack Obama's presidential library had 'major concerns' about going with the University of Chicago. 

Then just this week, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel proposed an ordinance that would allow the university to build the library on the city park land if the school was selected.

The timing of the proposal, which comes right before a selection deadline for the Obamas, has opponents of the plan upset that the Chicago machine is once again interfering in  city affairs.

'The big guys — the mayor, the university and the president — they're all together,' said resident Robin Kaufman at a public hearing concerning the possible transfer.

The city has not been keen to give up the spaces like the ones proposed for the library,  20 acres each in Washington Park and Jackson Park on Chicago's South Side, in the past.

George Lucas, creator of Star Wars, proposed a $300million museum on the lakefront, but ran into the non-profit Friends of the Parks, which is currently suing in federal court over the plans.

Cassandra Francis, president of Friends of the Parks, is less optimistic of her chances against Emanuel, who was the president's chief of staff until leaving in 2010 to run for mayor.

With talk that Emanuel and the foundation may have used a crisis to limit public opposition to the plans, Francis said it was likely both were in talks about the space 'for a long time.'

Emanuel has made the city's bid for the presidential library a central focus as he heads into the February 24 election trying to avoid a close race with upstart candidate Jesus 'Chuy' Garcia.

Machine politics: The ties between Emanuel and President Obama have opponents of the plan worried that the city will steamroll any opposition to putting in the library on parks land

Support in Chicago's South Side, where the parks are located, has been weak for Emanuel amidst worries over education and crime, but could rebound with a presidential library in the neighborhood.

'It is essential that the president's library is here in the city of Chicago and not in New York, and I will do what is necessary ... to move heaven and earth to make this happen,' Emanuel said this week.

The park district board, which oversees the land in question, is headed by Bryan Traubert, who recused himself from the decision because his wife, Penny Pritzker, is US commerce secretary. 

'Does anyone really think the park district won't do exactly what the mayor wants?' Delmarie Cobb, a Democratic political consultant and critic of Emanuel, said of the decision

'This is a slippery slope that none of us can go down because this is Chicago,' she added. 'And we all know how Chicago works.'
