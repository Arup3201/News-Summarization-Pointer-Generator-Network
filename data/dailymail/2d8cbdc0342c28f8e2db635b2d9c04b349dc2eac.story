'Go on, it'll be fun' was probably what a young Russian woman's friends told her when she expressed concerns about going skydiving.

She probably shouldn't have listened to them if this hilarious video, posted on English Russia, is anything to go by.

The unnamed blonde is first seen freaking out before she has even left the plane. As she is led to the door by the instructor, who she is strapped to for a tandem skydive, she begins to repeatedly scream and yell 'Mamushka' - Russian for 'mother'.

Fear of falling: A terrified Russian woman has appeared in an online video screaming her lungs out on a skydiving trip

Vertigo: Despite her incredibly loud protests the pair leap from the plane and began their descent

The bemused instructor, who seems to take it all in his stride, seems to ignore the fact that she is bellowing that she has changed her mind and the two plunge into the open air from the plane.

As the scream queen falls her incessant screaming appears to be briefly curtailed by a combination of shock and the g-forces exerted by free fall pulling the skin on her cheeks.

However, she eventually overcomes these twin barriers, once again fills her lungs and lets rip with the eardrum-bursting wailing.

The now-smiling instructor tries to 
encourage her as the two plummet to the ground, recorded by a camera on 
his wrist, but she's not having it.

That didn't last long: Her brief joy during the jump is curtailed when the parachute cord is pulled, reigniting her screams

Eventually, after a rare period of silence, the attractive young lady begins to enjoy the adrenaline-pumping jump and cracks a smile.

When the instructor, now presumably partially deaf, pulls the cord and the two begin gently floating to the ground, she pulls her goggles off in apparent relief.

Despite the perception of danger, skydiving fatalities are rare. Skydiving deaths have fallen every year since 2004.

Last year 49 people were killed worldwide, 21 of them in the U.S., which works out at roughly one death for every 150,000 jumps.
