Britain may end up paying hundreds of millions in extra cash to Brussels, David Cameron admitted yesterday, after a senior EU official warned refusal to pay would threaten our rebate.

The Prime Minister told MPs he will never pay ‘anything like’ the £1.7billion demanded by the European Commission, while MPs said he should tell the EU to ‘stick’ their bill.

However it seems the UK will almost certainly be forced to pay something extra after the Commission suggested it could withhold our £3billion-a-year rebate.

Mr Cameron's EU statement: The Prime Minister told MPs he will never pay ‘anything like’ the £1.7billion demanded by the European Commission, while MPs said he should tell the EU to ‘stick’ their bill

A furious Mr Cameron told MPs yesterday that the row had undermined public support for the EU. Despite his combative stance in the Commons, the Prime Minister appeared to shift his position by saying it was the ‘scale’ of the cash demand that was unjustified.

He said Treasury officials would ‘crawl’ through all the EU’s figures to ensure Britain was being asked to pay the right amount. But he had to fend off criticism that he should have known long before last Thursday that we might be facing such a huge cash demand.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Britain will not be paying 2billion euros to anyone on December 1 and we reject this scale of payment. We will be challenging this.’

But later a spokesman said that in the past, Britain had been happy to pay sums of ‘the low hundreds of millions’ – indicating that the UK may end up paying a similar amount this time.

The Prime Minister was accused of being ‘asleep at the wheel’ by Ed Miliband. He claimed the Office for National Statistics had been working on the changes since 2012 and publicly stated in May that they would impact on the UK’s contribution, while then-Treasury minister Nicky Morgan said in March that the Government was giving ‘high priority’ to addressing them.

And Europhile Tory MP Kenneth Clarke also cast doubt on the Prime Minister’s claim that the demand took the Government by surprise, telling MPs that the Foreign Office and Treasury must have known for at least five months that it was on its way.

In another blow for Mr Cameron, it emerged that the Netherlands – which has also been hit with a Brussels cash demand – said they would probably pay up. 

Yesterday the German finance minister undermined the Prime Minister’s hopes of getting powers over our borders back from Brussels – saying any change to the principle of free movement of workers was ‘unthinkable’.

Support for Ukip hit a new high after the EU’s budget demand, a poll last night suggested.

Backing for Ukip jumped four points to 19 per cent – one point above its previous high in June.

Labour slumped five points to 30 per cent – the party’s lowest rating under Ed Miliband – leaving it level with the Conservatives, the ComRes poll for The Independent showed.

And Mr Cameron’s insistence that Britain will not pay the full £1.7billion was met with scepticism from the EU’s budget commissioner, Jacek Dominik. 

Mr Dominik said it would be ‘extremely difficult’ for the UK to challenge the demand, as this would need the support of a qualified majority of member states.  He added that any refusal to pay the bill would open a ‘Pandora’s box’ which could put the future of the UK’s EU rebate on the negotiating table. 

Mr Dominik said he was ‘surprised’ by the Prime Minister’s anger, insisting that the adjustment of Britain’s contribution was a routine annual procedure.

He claimed that the figures behind the calculation were provided by the ONS, and the UK was informed on October 17 of the scale of the surcharge. Britain had had two opportunities to challenge the way the figure would be calculated. And he warned that Britain would be liable for ‘late payment fines’ if it failed to hand over the cash on time. 

Responding to Mr Dominik, Mr Cameron’s spokesman said: ‘The rebate is not on the table.’

The controversial European Arrest Warrant system must be retained by Britain to ‘keep our country safe’, David Cameron said last night.

The Prime Minister’s comments appeared to give strong backing to Home Secretary Theresa May, who warned opting out of the scheme could turn Britain into a ‘honeypot’ for criminals.

But the party leadership still faces the prospect of a rebellion by dozens of backbench Tory MPs who oppose the warrant.

The legislation allows EU citizens to be fast-tracked to other member states for trial and applies to crimes carrying a maximum sentence of 12 months or more.

Critics say it is a blunt tool which undermines civil liberties and is abused by law enforcement agencies in countries which lack British legal protections.

Many also point to the case of five-year-old Ashya King, whose parents were subject to a warrant after they sought treatment for his brain tumour abroad.

But supporters say opting out would lead serious criminals to view Britain as a safe haven.

Responding to questions from MPs over whether Britain should remain in the system, the Prime Minister said: ‘What matters most of all is that we give the police and the security services the powers they need to keep our country safe.’
