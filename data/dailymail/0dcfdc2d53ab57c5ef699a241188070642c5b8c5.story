Gatwick Airport bosses flew into a storm with protesters today when they announced plans for a controversial second runway at Britain’s second biggest airport.

It could double capacity at the West Sussex airport to 70million. It currently handles 34million passengers a year flying to 200 destinations in 90 countries.

Under a legal agreement made in 1979, the airport cannot build a second runway before 2019 – and decision makers at Gatwick insist they will honour that agreement.

Gatwick's future? If these proposals for a second runway are approved, the number of annual flights at the airport will soar from 250,000 to 500,000

Twice the flights: Gatwick's capacity could double to 70million if the plans are approved. Protesters say the second runway will hit the region's infrastructure hard

But after that all bets are off and Gatwick bosses say they are beginning detailed work now on the option for an additional new runway, which could be built in the next decade.

They say a second runway at Gatwick is a better option to boost Britain’s aviation than a third runway at Heathrow, the expansion of Stansted or a multi-billion ‘Boris Island’ option of a new airport in the middle of the Thames Estuary, as favoured by  London Mayor Boris Johnson and others.

But the Gatwick Area Conservation Campaign (GACC) has blasted the plans - and claimed the announcement was being made to drive up the value of the airport's owners.

GACC chairman Brendon Sewill said: 'We have always been 
totally opposed to a new runway on environmental grounds, and have had 
massive support from across Surrey, Sussex and west Kent.

'We have been supported by all the local MPs and all the county, 
district and parish councils in a wide area.

'If necessary, we will 
resume the battle. We will fight it all the way. We’ve done so before. 
We will do so again.'

Brendon Sewill of the Gatwick Area Conservation Campaign has vowed to fight the second runway. Villagers in nearby Charlwood fear environmental damage, heavier traffic, more noise and plummeting house prices

The GACC also released a statement 
that said: ‘We stand ready, if need be, to launch a massive campaign to 
defeat any new runway plan, as we have defeated such plans in the past.

'It
would mean twice as many planes in the sky, twice the noise, twice the 
local pollution, twice the number of airport-related cars, and twice the
climate change damage. Twice as many airport workers would need twice 
as many houses.'

Alternative: Gatwick claims the plan is a superior option to proposed expansion at Heathrow or Stansted or a new site in central London

Gatwick was owned by Heathrow operator 
BAA until it sold the Sussex airport in December 2009 for £1.5billion to
the consortium Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) – owners of London 
City Airport – following a highly critical report by the Competition 
Commission attacking BAA’s dominance in the South East.

The
Gatwick second runway option will be submitted as part of a 
'masterplan' to the Government-appointed aviation commission, led by 
former Financial Services Authority (FSA) chief Sir Howard Davies, which
will make its full report in summer 2015.

Gatwick chief executive Stewart 
Wingate defended the plan, saying a new runway at the airport could be 
'affordable and practical' and was a better option than new runways at 
Heathrow or Stansted.

He confirmed that a second runway would double passenger numbers to 70,000 and annual flights from 250,000 to 500,000.

It would take four to five years from
August 2019 to build the second runway and associated terminal 
buildings – meaning the earliest it could open would be about 2023.

Mr Wingate told the Daily Mail that 
GIP, which owns 42 per cent of Gatwick, had been ‘quite clear’ when it 
bought the airport three years ago that it would keep its holding for a 
limited period of between five and 10 years before selling.

That could take it up to 2019 when work on a new runway could begin.

Mr Wingate said: ’This was a decision by all the shareholders for the long-term interests of Gatwick.’

Plans for the future will evaluate various runway options and assess key requirements, including environmental, surface access and economic impacts.

It will also look at environmental issues including noise and air quality impacts on local communities.

Gatwick chiefs believe that the additional capacity, flexibility and 'resilience', or the ability to operate without long delays and cancellations caused by lack of staff or poor weather, that could be provided by a new runway at Gatwick will help to ensure that London's airports provide south-east England and the UK with the connectivity needed.

Gatwick Airport is the UK’s second largest airport and the busiest single-runway airport in the world.

It serves around 200 destinations in 90 countries for around 34 million passengers a year on short- and long-haul point-to-point services.

A second runway would double passenger number to around 70million a year.

Gatwick generates around 23,000 airport jobs and a further 13,000 jobs through related activities.

The airport is 28 miles south of London and owned by a group of international investment funds, of which Global Infrastructure Partners is the largest shareholder.

Gatwick serves more destinations than any other UK airport flying to 197 destinations compared with 163 destinations from Heathrow (Source: OAG data).

It is the UK’s largest short haul airport serving 145 destinations, excluding UK, compared with 73 destinations from Heathrow (Source: based on peak week summer 12 OAF scheduled data).

It is the UK’s largest domestic airport serving 12 destinations compared with seven destinations from Heathrow (Source: based on peak week summer 12 OAF scheduled data).

A 1979 legal agreement with West Sussex Council prohibits Gatwick from constructing a new runway before 2019.

The Government’s failure to consider Gatwick's expansion a decade ago because of this agreement forced ministers to re-run a previous consultation on airport expansion following a legal challenge.

Gatwick was owned by Heathrow operator BAA until it sold the Sussex airport in December 2009 for £1.5billion to the consortium Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) – owners of London City Airport – following a highly critical report by the Competition Commission attacking BAA’s dominance in the South East.

Gatwick is built on the site of an ancient manor house which became home to a racecourse in the 19th century. In the late 1920s land next to the racecourse was used as an aerodrome and in the 1930s became home to the Surrey Aero Club. In 1933: The Air Ministry approved commercial flights from Gatwick.

Bosses said that at least for the rest of this decade, London's airports will be relying on their existing physical capacity.

Gatwick's submission to the Davies Commission will also include a detailed evaluation of how Gatwick's existing single runway capacity can be maximised to contribute to the short-term capacity needs for London and the UK.

Mr Wingate said: 'I believe a new runway at Gatwick could be affordable, practical and give passengers a greater choice of routes to key markets.

'A new runway will allow Gatwick to compete and grow, increasing the choice available to passengers today. We have the space, capability and access to financial resources.'

He noted: 'Over the last three years we have transformed the airport, invested around £650 million and have a strong track record for delivering key routes to growth markets.

'However, we must now look to the future when Gatwick will become full and outline its long-term role in ensuring London has an efficient and resilient airport system that creates the crucial connectivity London and the UK needs.'

He insisted: 'There are clear practical advantages of a new runway at Gatwick. When compared with a third runway at Heathrow, we would have a significantly lower environmental impact whilst adding significantly more capacity.

'Stansted is half empty today, we already have much better surface transport links and feel our business case will be much stronger.'

Taking a swipe at the 'Boris Island' options for the Thames Estuary Mr Wingate noted: 'As for the Estuary airport there are major questions on affordability, environmental issues and whether they are deliverable.

'The process of evaluating the runway options will be complex. I am committed to undertaking a comprehensive and in-depth assessment that considers not only the economic benefits but also the environmental impacts. We will be consulting with our key stakeholders throughout the process.'

A statement from Gatwick Airport insisted: 'Our submission to the Commission will be consistent with Gatwick’s commitment to the 1979 legal agreement with West Sussex Council. That agreement prohibits Gatwick from constructing a new runway before 2019.'

The Government’s failure to consider 
Gatwick expansion a decade ago because of this agreement forced 
ministers to re-run a previous consultation on airport expansion 
following a legal challenge.

Baroness Jo Valentine, chief executive of London First, also praised the plans.

She said: ‘Anything that could increase runway capacity at London’s airports is good news for passengers and for the UK economy.

'If the UK is going to remain a competitive economy, we need more flights to growing and emerging markets. This announcement from London Gatwick broadens the debate on how we can achieve that and offers the potential for further competition and greater choice for passengers.'

Officials at Heathrow Airport added there voice to those objecting to the second runway.

A
spokesman said: 'The UK is not short of the point to point capacity 
provided by airports like Gatwick – there is already plenty of spare 
point to point capacity at Stansted, Birmingham and Luton.

'What
the UK is short of is hub airport capacity. Hub airports use transfer 
passengers to pool demand from different countries – and all the 
evidence suggests this is the only way to support the frequent and 
direct long haul routes that are vital to business and trade.'

Fears: People living near the airport are worried that they will be forced to move, but aviation bosses say the plans are practical
