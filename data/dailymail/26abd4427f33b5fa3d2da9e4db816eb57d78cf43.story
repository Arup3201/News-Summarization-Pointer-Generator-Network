What lurks at the bottom of the ocean?

That’s a question a team of researchers funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) will be hoping to answer.

Using one of the most advanced robotic submersibles in the world, scientists have just plunged to one of the deepest points on Earth.

The 40-day HADES project (Hadal Ecosystem Studies Project), funded by the NSF (National Science Foundation), is aiming to discover how marine life can survive at extreme ocean depths. Pictured is an abyssal grenadier spotted at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean on a previous mission

Their location is the Kermadec Trench, found just off New Zealand.

At a depth of 6.24 miles (10.04 kilometres) it is the fifth deepest trench in the world.

An inflow of deep waters from Antarctica also makes it one of Earth’s coldest trenches.

The 40-day expedition to observe this fascinating location began on Saturday.

The team will be using one of the world’s most advanced submersibles in the world, Nereus, in tandem with other technology.

The vehicle the team are using to explore the Kermadec Trench is Nereus.

According to the NSF it is the world’s only full-ocean-depth, hybrid, remotely-operating vehicle (ROV).

The hybrid design means it can be operated remotely both with and without a tether.

The advanced vehicle weighs 6,200 pounds (2,800 kilograms) and is slightly larger than an average car.

It is powered by 2,000 lithium-ion batteries and its hull can handle intense pressure.

The vehicle can operate remotely for up to 12 hours.

Imagery and video is streamed to a ship on the surface using a fibre-optic cable that is about the width of a human hair.

It has previously been used to explore the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of any ocean on Earth.

The project is known as the Hadal Ecosystem Studies Project (HADES), and its goal is to perform the first systematic study of life in ocean trenches.

‘The proposal to study the deep-sea environment as part of HADES was high-risk, but, we hope, also high-reward,’ David Garrison, program director in NSF’s Division of Ocean Sciences that funds HADES, says in a release.

‘Through this exciting project, we will shine a light into the darkness of Earth’s deep-ocean trenches, discovering surprising results all along the way.’

Ocean trenches like this are some of the least explored locations on the planet.

It’s often said that we know less about the bottom of the oceans than we do the surface of the moon.

According to Tim Shank, a biologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, one of the participating organisations, advances in technology now make such difficult missions possible.

‘We know relatively little about life in ocean trenches, the deepest marine habitats on Earth,’ he says.

‘We didn’t have the technology to do these kinds of detailed studies before.

‘This will be a first-order look at community structure, adaptation and evolution: how life exists in the trenches.’ 

The destination for this mission is the Kermadec Trench just off the coast of New Zealand, the world's fifth deepest trench and also one of the coldest due to inflow from Antarctica

One of the world's most advanced deep-submergence vehicles, a remotely operated submersible called Nereus, will be used by the researchers in their explorations

Among the questions the scientists are trying to answer, they will be hoping to find out how marine animals can survive at extreme pressures of 15,000 pounds (6,800 kilograms) per square inch.

For comparison, the pressure at sea level on Earth is 14.7 pounds (6.67 kilograms) per square inch.

The mission will see research conducted at 15 stations, which include both sites at sea level for testing purposes and along the base of the trench.

At each station imaging probes outfitted with cameras and experimental equipment known as Hadal-landers will be deployed.

Included in the experimental equipment will be respirometers, which will study how animal metabolism works at such extreme depths.

Life within deep trenches, such as the cusk eel imaged previously at the depths of the Marianas Trench, is known to be unusual and unique. The researchers will be hoping to discover how marine animals can withstand pressures 1,100 times that at sea level

Ocean trenches were once thought to be devoid of life.

Now it is believed that they are home to unique species unlike anything found elsewhere on Earth.

This mission will help to uncover not only how animals can survive here, but also what their food supply is.

The project will also provide important research for climate change studies.

Trenches are known to act as carbon sinks, so it is hoped the researchers can study how carbon and other chemicals are held on the ocean floor.

A crustacean scours the edge of the Marianas Trench in the central Pacific Ocean. It is not known how animals such as these are able to get food, something this mission will be hoping to discover
