Football never ceases to amaze in the improbable scenarios it can throw up. What goes around... comes around.

Liverpool took a financial hit of £35million when they let Andy Carroll and Stewart Downing go to West Ham back in August.

Both were expensive acquisitions who failed to make the grade at Anfield and, with better options available, Liverpool decided to cut their losses.

Now, the two rejected ones could repay that lost money by helping the Hammers to a win over champions-elect Manchester City on Sunday and deliver the title to Merseyside for the first time in 24 years.

Andy Carroll Signed from Newcastle for £35m in Jan 2011Scored 11 goals in 58 appearancesSold to West Ham for £15m in August 2013

Stewart DowningSigned from Aston Villa for £20m in July 2011Scored seven goals in 91 appearancesSold to West Ham for £5m in August 2013

Sure, it looks like an unlikely 
proposition - City are in imperious form, racking up a century of league
 goals this season as they thrashed Aston Villa 4-0 on Wednesday to put 
one hand on the trophy.

And 
West Ham, despite their 2-0 win over Tottenham last time out, haven't 
exactly been brilliant this campaign, raising serious doubts over 
whether Sam Allardyce will keep his job.

But
 last-day jitters are to be expected at the Etihad Stadium and West Ham 
could pounce like Queens Park Rangers almost did two years ago.

They
 led City 2-1 until the very last minute, allowing Man United to believe
 they had stolen the title, until Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero struck to
 win the title in the most dramatic of circumstances.

West
 Ham are 18-1 with the bookies to win on Sunday, but what price Carroll 
or Downing popping up to score and leave every City fan gnawing their 
nails?

It would certainly spark wild celebrations at Anfield, where Liverpool are playing Newcastle United and praying for a miracle.

Their
 surrender of a three-goal lead at Crystal Palace on Monday night, 
coupled with City's result, means they are relying on an unlikely 
combination of events.

Yet Carroll and Downing could have something to say about it. Stranger things have happened.

The England frontman was tipped for great things when Liverpool splashed out £35million for his services in January 2011.

As
 he arrived from Newcastle, Fernando Torres moved through the exit door 
in his British record £50million move and Kenny Dalglish clearly 
believed it was sound business.

But plagued by injuries, he struggled to make much impression at Anfield and made just nine appearances that season.

His first goals for Liverpool did come against Manchester City, perhaps a little omen for Sunday.

In
 all, Carroll scored 11 goals in 58 outings for Liverpool, a below 
average return for the amount of money invested in him, and when Brendan
 Rodgers came in promising to restore free-flowing football, the writing
 was on the wall.

More of a
 battering ram striker, Carroll was simply not compatible with Rodgers' 
vision of the 'Liverpool Way' and a loan spell at Upton Park was made 
permanent in August 2013.

That's better: Carroll has performed better at West Ham since his move despite an injury-plagued season

With
 Luis Suarez hitting top form and Daniel Sturridge later joining from 
Chelsea, Liverpool were quite prepared to take a £20m loss on Carroll.

Downing
 was bought from Aston Villa for £20million in the summer of 2011. The 
winger, an established England international, was ready to make the step
 up to a side that could challenge for the title and compete in the 
Champions League.

He won the
 League Cup in his first season at Anfield, and was man of the match in 
the final, but he finished the Premier League season with no goals and 
no assists.

The following 
campaign didn't see an improvement in his fortunes and Downing 
contributed just five goals and nine assists in 45 appearances, 
ultimately losing his place in the England team.

Again,
 Rodgers saw that better options were available and, once again deciding
 to take a hit on the decisions of a previous regime, sold him to West 
Ham for just £5million.

Given
 the strength of Liverpool's title challenge this season, Rodgers was 
vindicated in his decisions but the Liverpool boss would certainly be 
willing to accept a favour from either of them to achieve his title 
dream on Sunday.
