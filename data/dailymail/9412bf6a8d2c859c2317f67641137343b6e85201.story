Novelty T-shirts celebrating a county's famous stars under the slogan 'T'Only Way Is Yorkshire' has been slammed for featuring a cartoon of the Yorkshire Ripper.

The image of mass killer Peter Sutcliffe is contained alongside other well-known people or characters but has been condemned as 'tasteless' and 'disgusting'.

The garments have been produced by London-based firm Totally Original T-shirts which imitate the popular TV series The Only Way Is Essex.

A senior councillor has called for the company to immediately remove the items from sale.

Executive member, Coun David Green, whose responsibilities include tourism, described the decision to include the Ripper as 'the lowest of the low'.

He said: 'It's thoughtless, tasteless and the most disgusting, exploitative piece of clothing I have ever heard of.

Killer: Peter Sutcliffe, of Bradford, was convicted in 1981 of the murders of 13 women and the attempted murders of seven others

'To make money out of something like this is outrageous.

'I would suggest this company needs to re-think it's design and withdraw it from sale until Peter Sutcliffe is removed.'

Among the other well-known faces on the T-shirt, claimed by the makers to be a homage to all things that make Yorkshire great, are Yorkshire-born former Prime Minister Harold Wilson in a flat cap, actress Diana Rigg in a cat suit, Last of the Summer Wine character Nora Batty and former England cricketer Geoffrey Boycott.

They are shown perched on or behind a sofa and a drystone wall with pigeons and greyhounds.

Sutcliffe, of Bradford, was convicted in 1981 of the murders of 13 women and the attempted murders of seven others during a reign of terror which started in the mid-1970s.

The T-shirt is one of the Grim Up North range, according to the manufacturer's website, described as 'celebrating the best of Northern style and humour'.

A Yorkshireman who received one of the T-shirts as a present and has since complained, said: 'How can anyone design a T-shirt with him on the front and how can anyone wear it?'

A spokesman for TOT-shirts said: 'It's just a bit of dark humour and if it's offended anyone it wasn't intentional.

'If the man who was offended wants to get in touch with us we'll replace it with another T-shirt of his choice.

'We sell lots of our Grim Up North range to northerners which proves they are big enough to take the mickey out of the stereotype.'

Chairman of the Yorkshire Society, Keith Madeley, said: 'We're making great strides to promote the proper professional image of Yorkshire and we don't want so-called dark humour to be holding us back.
