Games between Manchester United and Liverpool are always among the most hard-fought of the season

Feeling confident?

DT: I am, despite Monday’s game (1-0 win over Swansea) I think we’ve our best chance in years of getting a good result; even more so than last season at Old Trafford.

SP: The performance against Spurs came at just the right time to instil some confidence in fans and the players. It wasn't the win, it was the tempo but that being said, it is Anfield. When was the last time United played well there?

What would it mean to the fans of your team to win this game?

DT: Considering how United have fallen in recent years, it means a lot more in the grand scheme of finishing in the top four. United’s scalp for us is still a big one but the three points are just as – if not more important.

SP: It is and always will be the biggest game of the season and Sunday is the biggest game between the clubs in years. Both have a lot on the line and so much to lose, so it is going to be an intense atmosphere, more so than usual.

United fans have always viewed Liverpool as their biggest game of the season, this year it's even bigger

Is this the biggest rivalry in English football?

DT: Without a doubt, regardless of what City or Everton fans like to think – it’s still the first one I look for when the fixture list comes out.

SP: Without question it is the biggest rivalry. Man City might be challengers now but United fans spent decades laughing at them trying to hold on to our coat tails and as for Chelsea, that rivalry has been forced on to everybody thanks to Roman Abramovich. I miss the old days of Arsenal being a bitter rival but although that feeling has dampened in recent years, the rivalry with Liverpool has never lost its potency.

What was your take on Man United's 3-0 win over Liverpool in December?

DT: It was particularly miserable, as it felt as if our previous season was just a one-off. Obviously, we’re back to something like last season’s form now but that was hard to take, as I felt we deserved something.

SP: What a cracking game that was but the 3-0 over Spurs last weekend was much more convincing. We were vibrant in attack against Liverpool yet defensively we were weak and it was all about David de Gea's heroics. If not for an outstanding performance from him, it could have been very different.

Juan Mata added a second goal for the home side to compound Liverpool's misery under Brendan Rodgers

Robin van Persie scored the third goal but Liverpool and Rodgers have not lost in the league since that day

What's changed for both teams since that result?

DT: I don’t think much has changed for United, they’re still winning games, often without being the better side, but they were good against Tottenham, which could be a concern. Liverpool have improved so drastically though, and it wouldn’t be an overstatement to say that a bit of better early-season form would’ve seen another title challenge.

SP: Liverpool haven't lost in the Premier League since then which says it all. They've had a post-January renaissance akin to what United did annually under Sir Alex and come into the game on Sunday as the league's in-form side. On the other hand, United have been a mixed bag all season but have been able to grind out a lot of results as well, so we've become quite hard to beat which is certainly progress.

Angel Di Maria is free from suspension to return to the United team. Is that a good or a bad thing?

DT: Sadly, it makes little difference. He’s one of the world’s best but Louis van Gaal just doesn’t know what to do with him. Here’s hoping he starts him up front again!

SP: You can't underestimate any world-class player regardless of what form they are in. Before his red card against Arsenal, Di Maria actually had his best 45 minutes in a long time and his pin-point cross set up Wayne Rooney's equaliser.

I expect him to come straight back into the starting XI because of his pace as United will more than likely set-up on the counter-attack as we did away to Arsenal. With Ashley Young and Rooney bang in form, United should have some great pace up front.

Do you expect Steven Gerrard to start for Liverpool?

DT: No, and nor should he. He was solid and calmed us down when he came on on Monday but if the game has any of the usual frantic pace about it he’ll be our major weak link.

SP: I really hope Liverpool get caught up in the sentimental wave of Gerrard's last derby and start him but I can't see it happening. They're a better side without him as Jordan Henderson has stepped it up this year.

Rodgers may elect to leave his captain Steven Gerrard on the bench as he continues to recover from injury

What are your plans for the day of the game?

DT: I usually find the games against United too nerve-wracking so I tend to not be around other people. There’s usually a lot of work to do on the day of the match too so, I’ll most likely watch with family or by myself and hope I don’t have to drown my sorrows later on!

SP: It's an early kick-off so won't be much time to do anything before 1.30 comes around. As there's so much riding on this game, I'll probably just be a bag of nerves right up until the first whistle.

Daniel Sturridge isn't quite back to his best after returning from injury but could have a key role to play

What would a win for your team do to their Champions League qualification prospects?

DT: I wouldn’t say a win for either side would seal the other’s fate but I do believe if Liverpool win then the confidence the three points would bring would be incredible in terms of momentum, it may even lead to a push for third or (whisper it) second.

SP: A win for either side would be absolutely massive. It would give United a very nice cushion over Liverpool and consolidate our spot in fourth and for Liverpool, it would see them leapfrog United. It's all to play for.

United manager Louis van Gaal has already stated his belief that his team can catch their local rivals City

The last six meetings have all had a winner and the bookies expect Liverpool to be victorious here. What's your prediction?

DT: I’m going to say a less comfortable win than we’d hope but still, I’m going for a 2-0 to Liverpool.

SP: I'm going to disagree with the bookies here and go for a draw. It's a derby so anything can happen and form usually doesn't count for much.

Both sides are going to have chances as there are defensive weaknesses in United and Liverpool. Hopefully United can be as clinical as they were against Spurs but away at Anfield is a different kettle of fish.

My prediction? A score draw: 1-1.
