These images show the filthy squalor of a fish shop where a customer found a deep-fried cockroach in a bag of chips. 

Cod Plus in Brighton was investigated by council officials who found rat droppings, congealed food and a 'smelly' box of sewage-like liquid at shop following the complaint from a member of the public.

Owner Asif Javaid was fined £1,000 and ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge by magistrates for the 'shocking' state of the premises. 

A brown box of 'smelly' fluid was one of several findings made by council officials at Cod Plus takeaway 

Built-up grease and congealed food debris was also found at the city centre shop by Brighton and Hove Council officials  

Officers first visited the shop last September to investigate the cockroach allegation. There, they found rat droppings where food was kept and near the rubbish bins. 

Despite warnings, more were found on a second visit to the site as was congealed fat on cooking appliances and on the inside of the microwave. 

Two adults rats had also been caught in traps, Brighton Magistrates' Court heard. 

Javaid was found guilty of failing to have adequate procedures in place to control pests, failing to keep the premises clean and in good repair and condition, and failing to ensure that food handlers were supervised, instructed or trained in food hygeine matters. 

He was found not guilty of a fourth charge of failing to put in place, implement and maintain permanent procedures based on Hazard Anslysis and Critical Control Points principles, a Brighton and Hove Council spokesman said. 

Old food and grease in the takeaway's microwave was discovered during an investigation last September

Old and 'fresh' rat droppings were also found in the shop, as well as two 'adult rats' which were caught in traps

Cod Plus was investigated after a customer claimed to find a deep-fried cockroach in a bag of chips 

The court heard how Javaid claimed to have suffered racial abuse following his first hearing last year. 

'Since this case was reported my family has been subjected to all kinds of abuse,' the 43-year-old said. 

Deputy Chair of Environment, Sustainability and Transport Committee, Councillor Lizzie Deane said: 'Prosecution is always the last resort, and while we are appalled to hear Mr Javaid’s claims of racial abuse following last year’s court hearing, we will continue to take the necessary steps to ensure that residents and visitors can eat safely in our city.'

Rat droppings were discovered near where food and rubbish bins were kept in the takeaway, the court heard  

Grease splashes in the kitchen were among other discoveries made by the team of investigators
