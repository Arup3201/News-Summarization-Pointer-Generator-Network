Reforms to the formula used to ration expensive medicines will make it harder for NHS patients to get new life-saving drugs, warn campaigners.

The rationing body, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), plans to lower the cost threshold for new treatments and end the priority given to patients who are dying.

The reforms are a shift to a system which the Government pledged would allow patients to ‘access the drugs and treatments their doctors think they need’. It involves changes to a complex formula, known as quality adjusted life years (QALY).

NICE chief executive Andrew Dillon said the rationing body would exceed the new £20,000 limit in exceptional circumstances

This determines the cost-effectiveness of a treatment by working out how it extends a life compared with existing treatments.

Treatments have previously been approved if the cost is below £20,000, but may also get the go-ahead if they fall between £20,000 and £30,000.

The proposals delete the £30,000 upper limit – which means many drugs currently approved, such as the breast cancer treatment Herceptin, would have had a slim chance of getting a green light from NICE if applying in future.

And some drugs approved under ‘end of life criteria’ – ones which might extend a dying patient’s life by precious weeks or months – will also face a tough battle.

Andrew Wilson, of the Rarer Cancers 
Foundation, said: ‘Far from making it easier for patients to get the 
latest cancer drugs, these changes set the bar even higher.’

NICE chief executive Andrew Dillon said the rationing body would exceed the new £20,000 limit in exceptional circumstances.

He
 added: ‘We are not going to restrict further the availability of drugs.
 If companies offer prices that really reflect the value their 
treatments bring, it holds open the prospect for us to say yes more 
often.’
