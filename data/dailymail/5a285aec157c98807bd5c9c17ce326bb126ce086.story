The couple's son David, 19, and friend 
Courtney Ann Williams, 18, were taken to hospital but were released last
night along with Mr Porter.

Some witnesses said they were not sure the police car had its sirens on and a patrol official confirmed the trooper was going through a red light.

‘The Braves family is deeply saddened and shocked to learn about the tragic accident,’ a spokesman for the baseball team said last night.

‘Our thoughts and prayers go out to Jeff and Kathy's family, their son David and all their friends and loved ones.’

But witness
Sandy Jones told WSBTV: 'I see his lights, but there's no siren, and 
he's speeding up. If he's in an emergency why are there no sirens?'

'You still exercise due regard when you pass any type of intersection or anything, but he was going against the red light'
