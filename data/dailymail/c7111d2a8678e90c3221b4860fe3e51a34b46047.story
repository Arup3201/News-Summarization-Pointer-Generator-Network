Christian Eriksen was a visitor to the Steel City on Wednesday evening but it was he who showed the people of Sheffield a true cutting edge. His first goal was a thing of beauty, a sublime free kick that bounced into the top corner off the post, a strike the game’s true artists would be proud of.

But increasingly it is his ability to deliver in the heat of the furnace that impresses. Sure, he’s a fine player, but can he do it on a snowy Wednesday night in South Yorkshire when there’s a League Cup final place at stake and time is ebbing away?

An acutely angled finish in the 88th minute to avoid extra time and secure a Wembley showdown with Chelsea proved he can. It was the fourth time this season Eriksen has scored a winning goal in the 88th minute or later. He credits the work Mauricio Pochettino did on his squad’s fitness levels in pre-season with a propensity for late goals – the Argentine is said to demand so much from his players in training that they require ‘two hearts.’

Eriksen has certainly hit his stride working under Pochettino. With every passing match, the £11million Tottenham paid for him in August 2013 is appearing to be more of a bargain. That wasn’t always the case. Although there were glimpses of his undoubted talent - he won the club’s player of the year award in his first season - he didn’t burst onto the Premier League stage in the way his reputation suggested he might.

The 22-year-old from Middelfart, Denmark arrived in England from Ajax with high expectations attached to him as one of the most highly rated youngsters in Holland’s top flight.

Eriksen began playing football as soon as he could walk and was soon marked out as one of the most gifted players in Middelfart, a town of less than 15,000 people on the island of Funen. It wasn’t long before he was picked up by OB, the biggest club in Odense, the largest city on the island. Uffe Pedersen, the head of talent for OB, remembers a special player.

‘You could tell already he was something special. Every time Christian moved to a higher level he needed just one or two games to cope with that and then become the best player,’ Pedersen told The Guardian in 2013. He often played a couple of years ahead. ‘He steps up easily, this young guy taking over the whole game, setting the speed and shape of the game. Christian could play anywhere with good players.’

The playmaker flourished at OB and was named ‘the best technical player’ in a major tournament in Denmark as a 13-year-old. Representing Denmark through the age groups, he piqued the interest of Europe’s biggest clubs. Pedersen accompanied Eriksen as he travelled to Chelsea, Barcelona and Milan before he finally opted to join Ajax.

Although he was skinny and relatively small – he is now 5ft 10in – when he arrived at Ajax, Frank de Boer who was in charge of youth development at the time was instantly impressed. ‘He's always on the move. Quick thinking. He has eyes in his back,’ he said, ‘When you think he doesn't see you, he sees you.’

In 2010, aged just 18, Eriksen was the youngest player at the World Cup in South Africa, appearing twice as a substitute before Denmark exited in the group stages. The next year, he was named Dutch Talent of the Year as Ajax won the title.

Even when his team loses, Eriksen possesses skill that makes him sparkle. When Denmark lost 2-1 to England in 2011, English fans were preoccupied by the debut of Jack Wilshere but Eriksen, one month the Arsenal star’s junior, put him in the shade, repeatedly stealing the ball from under his nose and dictating the pace of play.

Liverpool and Chelsea were interested in signing him but it was Tottenham who secured his services, moving for him after their pursuit of Willian came to nothing. This term, he has been the club’s standout performer and with eight goals is the Premier League's top scoring midfielder, alongside Eden Hazard.

His rich vein of form has been noted by many of Europe’s elite clubs. Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund are all thought to be interested in luring Eriksen to the contintent. Domestically, Liverpool and Arsenal are also keen on the midfielder.

Spurs' chances of holding onto him would surely improve if they can secure Champions League football next season with a top four finish – and how they would dearly love to keep him at White Hart Lane.
