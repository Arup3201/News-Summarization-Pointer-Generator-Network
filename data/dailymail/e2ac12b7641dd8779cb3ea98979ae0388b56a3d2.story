I'm sure there were many millions tuning in for all the live action from London's fake East End over on the BBC. But around the same time, over on ITV, the big question was whether Liverpool's injured captain Steven Gerrard was going to die a death as an ITV pundit for his own team's Europa League tie against Besiktas.

Telly has been pretty kind to ex-England skippers of recent years. But that has tended to be from the world of cricket where the likes of Michael Atherton, Michael Vaughan, Nasser Hussain and Andrew Strauss have all managed to convert themselves from awkward post-match rent-a-quote merchants into erudite masters of punditry.

For the majority of his playing career, you'd struggle to argue that Gerrard has remained anything but staunchly in that first category. Clint Eastwood may have made an entire career out staring intently out of a pained squint. But with a similar expression when on camera, Steven - and, yes, of course this is a man who has very much let his excellent feet do the talking - has tended to look more like he's having a torch shone in his eyes while somewhere he shouldn't be.

Steven Gerrard worked as a pundit on ITV for Liverpool's Europa League clash with Besiktas

The 34-year-old former England captain was not playing because of a hamstring injury 

However, that recent interview before the Merseyside derby with Jamie Redknapp on Sky Sports shed light on a different Gerrard. Perhaps with the shackles now falling off, and certainly with a good mate to talk to, there was more than a hint that perhaps the real Stevie G will soon stand up.

Mind you, live telly is a different beast, and a bigger ask. Yet he started the coverage looking relaxed, and with a big smile on his face. This I feel, was thanks to having the quality pairing of Statler and Waldorf - that's Gordon Strachan and Peter Reid - alongside him. These two old stagers know their onions, but still chatter away like they’re tucked in the corner of the snug on a Sunday lunchtime.

Strachan in particular managed to lighten the mood quickly by interrupting proceedings to ask the injured midfielder if he had any idea how the grades of hamstring injuries worked, because he had none? To which Gerrard just chuckled and said: 'Haven't got a clue, either'. If it helps Gordon, I think it goes from wafer thin to honey roast.

Gerrard then faced his first little test when responding to a short film on his team mate Daniel Sturridge. As at ease with a camera in his face as he is a ball at his feet, he explained that goal-scoring 'is natural for me'. But he also pointed out: 'I'd be surprised if I don't see (Gerrard) back here' in a management capacity. Sturridge's captain deftly avoided that potential two-footer by talking about how he was still very much a player, and that he was also aware that management 'is tough'.

'Have a look at us!', responded Gordon. A few more laughs, and that was the pre-match dealt with tidily.

After what Andy Townsend then described as a 'tough 45 minutes', it was back to the pundits for their half time verdict. And although Gerrard's words said that 'for a nil-nil, it was very entertaining', it seemed that he hadn't bothered to tell his face. Which had reverted back to the rather dour demeanour it is given to adopt when out if a suit, and in a kit. But that's just a lack of experience. Not knowing to turn yourself back on. Something he managed to do when he quipped of the excellent young Jordon Ibe's first half: 'I think the contract he signed this morning has done him the world of good'.

Gerrard started the evening slowly but grew into his role as a pundit 

Balotelli took the ball off team-mates Jordan Henderson and fellow striker Daniel Sturridge to take the penalty

Post-match provided Gerrard with a different challenge as the winning penalty came shrouded in controversy. This I assumed would be the moment he pulled on the PR's white coat and become Doctor Spin. Not a bit of it! 'I'd have took the penalty. That's what would have happened', was the injured captain's unswerving response to Matt Smith's question. And he didn't stop there. 'Jordan [Henderson] should have taken the penalty. Mario was being mischievous. Rules are rules. Codes are codes'.

This certainly got his two senior colleagues shifting in their seats. Peter Reid started to explain he couldn't see any problem with it, but Gerrard was all over him. 'What would you have said to Balotelli if he had missed?', he asked sharply. Reid replied: 'But he didn't’ and Strachan jumped in. 'Not the point' snapped the Scot, as those two then went at it. I have to admit, this was not the diplomatic package I was expecting the Liverpool player to deliver at his place of work, inside Anfield.

And so that was Steven Gerrard at work in the TV booth. We got a few smiles, then some frowns, but in the end, absolutely no nonsense. In other words, EXACTLY what we expect of him when he's on the field of play.
