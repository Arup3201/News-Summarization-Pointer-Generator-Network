A ‘treasure trove’ of more than 100 extremely rare classic cars - including Porsches, Triumphs and a Ford Model T - will be sold off unless their mystery owner comes forward to claim them.

The fleet of 105 rare British and American vehicles were abandoned at a mansion in Biddulph Park, Staffordshire, last July when the tenant was evicted for not paying the rent.

It includes British classics such as the Jensen Interceptor, built in West Bromwich; a Humber Sceptre, made by the now-defunct Rootes Group; a Humber Super Snipe and two Triumph Stags.

There is also a Porsche 911, a Model T dating back almost a century, two Italian Lancia Fulvias, a German NSU sports car, Mini and Morris Minor pick-ups, a Cortina soft top, and an Escort RS 2000.

Now businessman Mark Greaves, who owns the land, says unless the cars' owner stumps up the £108,990 bill for storing them, he will auction them all off to recoup his money.

Mr Greaves, managing director at flooring firm Flowcrete in Sandbach, Cheshire, said: ‘We had a tenant in the property who was evicted for non-payment.

‘To start with there were about 140 cars, but I think he took the best of them with him. He was interested in vintage cars and became a bit of a collector, but he left the majority of them behind.’

The Model T Ford was launched in Detroit in 1908.

With a 10-gallon tank and optimum fuel consumption of 20 miles per gallon, it changed the car industry by popularising private cars for everyday use.

Drivers used a level and a pedal to change gears, plus another pedal for reverse.

There was no clutch and the throttle was found where motorists would see modern indicators.

Mr Greaves is refurbishing the property to rent out again and is keen to remove the vehicles. Most of the cars have been kept indoors, with 68 put in storage and the other 37 left in a field outside.

Motoring expert John Swift said: ‘This is a treasure trove of classic cars. If they are auctioned enthusiasts from around the country will be flocking to the sale.

‘To find a collection that includes such rarities as a couple of Triumph Stags, Mini and Morris Minor pick-ups, a Cortina soft top, and what might yet prove to be an Escort RS 2000 and so many others is just amazing.

‘Someone could be sitting on a fortune. It depends on the condition of the cars, but I can see this collectively bringing a six-figure amount.

‘This will be one of the biggest auctions of a single collection that this country has seen in a long time.’

In order to move the vehicles legally, Mr Greaves has been forced to put out a public notification to inform the owner of his plans to sell them unless they are claimed by December 19.

He said: ‘I thought he had taken the vehicles of most value. I gave him lots of time to come and collect them. I sent emails and made phone calls but so far I have heard nothing back.

‘If they remain unclaimed we will look at auctioning them off as one group or selling them to a dealer.’
