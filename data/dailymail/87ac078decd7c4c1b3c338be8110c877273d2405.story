Almost 80 members of Congress are asking federal regulator to keep in-flight cell phone calls banned, calling the calls an outright hazard to a the safety of everyone on board.

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has proposed allowing in-flight phone calls with modern technologies now able to deliver such mobile services.

That proposal doesn't argue for or against the results of allowing calls, only the technical merits.

Artstechnica reports that the proposal is being viewed as a way to 'lift outdated rules.'

But Congressmen opposed to the change say there's more to consider than just the technical aspects.

In a statement written Monday to the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Transportation, the Justice Department, and the Federal Communications Commission, the Congressmen detailed the many ways in which in-flight phone calls could be a hazard for passengers.

'The nature of anÂ aircraft cabin would make it impossible for passengers to remove 
themselves from loud or unwanted conversations and disputes, they wrote. 'Instead of 
focusing on required safety-related tasks, flight attendants may be 
forced to intervene in or mediate disputes between passengers on 
appropriate content and volume of voice calls, thus distracting their 
attention from other passengers and job responsibilities.

Congressmen warn the calls could aggravate nearby passengers unable to keep from overhearing the conversations and exacerbate the already tense environment of a cramped airplane

'Additionally,
 when noise and distraction levels rise because of talking passengers, 
the ability to hear important safety announcements, either from the 
cockpit or cabin, will be impaired and crucial information may be 
missed,' they concluded.

Lawmakers also worry that phone calls could aggravate an already tense environment.

'Arguments in an aircraft cabin already start over mundane issues, like seat selection, reclining seats, and overhead bin space,' they wrote. 'And the volume and pervasiveness of voice communications would only serve to exacerbate and escalate these disputes.'
