England advanced to the Women’s Rugby World Cup semi-finals on Saturday afternoon following a nail-biting 13-13 draw against Canada in Marcoussis.

Captain Sarah Hunter scored England’s only try, with centre Emily Scarratt converting and adding two penalties.

The result meant defending champions New Zealand can’t now reach the last four, while Canada were left to wait on other results going their way.

Hunter said: ‘It was physical and competitive. We knew that Canada would front up and they definitely brought their game to us.

‘We know that we’ve been in a battle and it was a great game to be involved in.

‘We’re delighted to get out of the pool — that’s what it was always about.’
