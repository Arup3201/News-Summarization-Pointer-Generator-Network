The 15-year-old Washington boy charged who was charged with trying to kidnap a toddler was linked to a similar incident nine months ago.

The unnamed teenager, who will be tried in juvenile court for the attempted abduction of 22-month old Owen Wright a week ago, was also accused of trying to lure a child last June.

He does not have a criminal history, and has pleaded not guilty to second degree kidnapping after being caught on video attempting to run off with a child in broad daylight while wearing a fake mustache and glasses.

Similar incident: The suspect who was caught on video (pictured) allegedly snatched a 22-month-old from a park was accused of trying to lure a 11-year-old last year

Lincoln County Prosecutor Jeff Barkdull said that prosecutors were forwarded a report accusing the boy of luring an 11-year-old last year.

Attorneys decided not to file charges in that case because 'It did not meet the elements of luring,' according to Mr Barkdull.

The child's mother questioned him and the suspect let go, the report said.

Mr Barkdull said he stood by the decision not to pursue the previous incident  in Sprague, a farm town of around 500 people located about 40 miles west of Spokane along Interstate 90.

Prior to the boy's arrest, the man captured on video was identified as a 30-year-old man.

However, two brave teens who helped thwart the kidnapping by running after the abductor later recognized the suspect as their disguised school classmate.

Misidentified: Witnesses originally said the kidnapper was around 30-years-old, 6-foot-2 and had a mustache

'I do know the person': Andrew Crain, 15, along with his 16-year-old friend Isaac Yow gave chase after an unidentified minor allegedly snatched a 22-month-old toddler from a city park

Andrew Crain, 15, along with his 16-year-old friend Isaac Yow, gave chase after they saw an unidentified minor allegedly take a toddler from a city park. They helped get the child home safely.

'I'm feeling happy, I'm feeling angry at the same time. I do know the person,' Crain told KXLY.   

Residents of the tiny town of Sprague expressed relief Thursday that an arrest has been made in the attempted kidnapping — an incident that drew wide attention because of the video. 

'They're so relieved,' said Dorothy Giddings, an antique store owner in Sprague who was involved in the rescue of the toddler on Sunday. 'The only sad part is it is a young boy who lives here in town.' 

Dramatic surveillance video footage showed the suspect running down a sidewalk with the toddler in his arms last Sunday.

The child's two siblings screamed and chased him before Crain and Yow joined the chase. The abductor fled after putting down the toddler. who was not hurt.

'They have a motherly instinct,' Michael Wright told The Spokesman-Review about his two older children. 'We're going to watch each other closer and even more diligently than we did before.'

Giddings said the 15-year-old suspect lived with his family, but did not socialize much with other teenagers. He apparently wore a disguise during the attempted abduction to mask his identity. 

The identity of the youth was being withheld because he is a juvenile.

The dramatic surveillance video footage showed a male running down a sidewalk with the toddler in his arms last Sunday.

The incident began after Michael Wright left his three children with a baby sitter in Sprague on Sunday while he went to work.

The children — Brenden, 10, Delicia, 8, and the toddler Owen — were playing unsupervised in a city park near the sitter's house.

Sheriff's deputies said the suspect talked with the children for a few minutes, then scooped the toddler out of his stroller and ran down the street. 

Owen's two siblings screamed and chased their brother.

Delicia's cries alerted Ms Giddings, who was working at her antique store downtown.

Ms Giddings said she realized what was happening and sent her grandson Crain, 15, and his friend Yow, 16, to chase the kidnapper. 

The scene ended after two teenage boys rushed towards the disguised man, who put down the toddler and fled. The toddler was not hurt.

One of Owen's young siblings also positively identified the suspect.

Reunited: Nicole and Michael Wright hold their 22-month-old son Owen who was abducted from Sprague City Park on Sunday. Owen's sister Delicia, 8, and brother Brenden, 10, alerted a pair of teenage boys

Heroes: Delicia said that the kidnapper told them he was nice to kids and had been babysitting for a long time. She didn't believe him and her screams helped raise the alarm

No vehicle was seen with the kidnapper, who was initially described by the sheriff's office as about 30 years old, 6-foot to 6-foot-2, with a thin build, brown hair and a mustache.

Authorities announced the arrest on Wednesday afternoon, culminating a tense four days in the small Washington town.

Police had gone to Sprague High School and watched the suspect, who had a similar gait to the then-unidentified man caught on video. 

The 15-year-old suspect originally denied any connection with the attempted abduction, but a jacket matching the one in the surveillance footage was later found in his room.

He was denied bail on Friday.

Lincoln County Judge John Strohmaier said that he was worried about the boy's safety in the small community, according to the Spokesman Review.

'He has gained some notoriety,' he said. 

The suspect's next court date is April 10.
