Newly-released video has emerged of an admitted serial killer blaming his 2011 murder spree on the ‘kill gene.’

Former Marine Itzcoatl ‘Izzy’ Ocampo made the horrifying suggestion during questioning in early 2012 shortly after being arrested for the killing of six people in and around Anaheim, California.

Many soldiers are said to have something called a ‘warrior gene,’ but Ocampo believed his genetics enabled him to kill six people – four homeless men, mother and her son.

It was in his blood: Itzcoatl Ocampo admitted to killing six people and said he had a 'kill gene' that made him want to murder at least another 10

The interrogation tape released by KTLA provides a glimpse into the mind of a man who told investigators he joined the Marines to learn how to kill so he could become a prolific serial killer, according to a transcript of his police interviews released by the Los Angeles Times.

He intended to kill 16 people, authorities said.

‘Did you feel sexually aroused when you were doing this?’ He is asked by Anaheim police sergeant Daron Wyatt.

‘No, sir,’ says Ocampo.

‘How about afterwards?’ Wyatt asks.

‘Sexually aroused? No sir,’ Ocampo responds. 

“But
 I felt weird… the f*****g kill gene like hit my sperm,’ he continues. 
‘Like, that’s the way I feel right now, like my sperm have f*****g kill 
in them.

He wanted to be prolific: Ocampo had intentions to kill 16 people before his killing spree was stopped

‘Like all right, you’re not a b***h anymore.’

When asked why he killed the homeless men, Ocampo says he was doing his duty.

‘Why did it have to be done, to satisfy your need?’ Wyatt asks.

‘No, not only did I make the county look bad or the state, they were making the place look bad also,’ Ocampo answers.

‘So really what you were doing is you were helping clean up the county, clean up the area?’ Wyatt responds.

‘In a way, sir, yes,’ says Ocampo.

Ocampo also admits to knowing the difference between right and wrong, but says the murders were wrong but ‘had to be done.’

He further bemoans not being able to kill while in the Marines, saying that he would ‘look at other Marines and, you know, want to be like them.’

The former Marine, who served in Iraq, admitted to the six killings but died in custody late last year before ever facing trial.

Investigators told the Los Angeles Times they believe he ingested Ajax household cleaner to commit suicide.

His trial was set to start early this year.
