A Mexican teenager has been charged with murdering his 17-year-old girlfriend and stuffing her body in a wardrobe after she found out he was seeing another woman.

Student Yael Eduardo Espinosa Guerrero, 19, appealed for help finding his girlfriend Silvia Paredes Moedano after she went missing last week and even comforted her parents.

But in reality Miss Moedano's body was hidden in Guerrero's bedroom after he allegedly strangled her to death when she told him their relationship was over.

The body of Silvia Paredes Moedano, 17, was found hidden in her boyfriend's wardrobe days after she found out he was seeing another girl

Miss Moedano went to his home in Tultitlan, north of Mexico City, after she found out he was seeing another woman - Elia Carbajal Becerril, 22.

It is then alleged that Guerrero throttled the 17-year-old to death and hid her body in his wardrobe.

He is also said to have called Becerill for help hiding the body, which lay in the bottom of his closet for three days before it was found by police.

After Miss Moedano went missing last Thursday, Guerrero told local newspapers: 'Wherever you are Silvia there are people here that miss you, please let us know you are alive and well.'

On Sunday, police officers interviewed Guerrero's parents to ask if knew where Miss Moedano might be, or if they had seen her before she disappeared.

During the interview, an officer spotted the girl's handbag in the student's bedroom. 

It was then that they made the grim discovery of Miss Moedano's lifeless body in her boyfriend's wardrobe.

Police spokesman Macabeo Garcia said: 'The handbag was found with blood stains on it and when they went to question the man when he arrived home, he ran off. 

'When he was finally arrested he tried to pay officers cash to let him go again.'

Guerrero was arrested and charged with murder as well as bribery.

A post-mortem examination found that Miss Moedano died from strangulation after a violent attack. 

Becerril was also arrested for her involvement in the murder.

Mr Garcia added: 'We are currently looking at the level of her involvement and in the meantime both are being held in custody.'
