A teenager who left college to join the Royal Navy has been turned down - because he wears braces.

Harley-Joe Steele, 17, had reached the last stages of the application process but fell at the final hurdle because of the metal braces he has worn for the last year.

Despite attending interviews and assessments over the last six months after giving up his school education for the service, it is only now that he has been turned down - just weeks before he was due to start training.

The Royal Navy has admitted that the braces were not mentioned in its own list of medical conditions which could temporarily prevent recruitment.

The teenager, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, said: 'I was devastated when they told me I had failed the medical because of the braces as I wasn't fit for training.

'I first applied about six months ago when I was still at school, and have gone through the process of four different interviews and tests, but no-one said anything about my braces.

'I've had them for a year and don't know how much longer I need to wear them for but I wouldn't have left school then if they had told me about this earlier.

'Why didn't they say anything before? I've given up school because I thought I would be joining the Navy this year and now all of a sudden I've got nothing.

'I will have to try and find a job and then apply again when I get the braces off.'

His father Simon Akeroyd said the youngster had been through 'weeks and weeks' of interviews and tests as well as face-to-face interviews without anyone mentioning the braces.

'There are going to be loads of kids going through this, Mr Akeroyd said.

'I can't understand why there wasn't anything on the application form, if this is a rule.

'He left school because this was going to be his career, and now he's just sitting around the house with nothing to do until his braces come off.

'Some kids don't want braces, but he was happy to have them to sort his teeth out.

'This has been such a knock-back.'

The youngster, who applied to be a weapons engineer, has simply been advised to apply again after the braces have been removed. When he initially had them fitted a year ago, he was told they needed to stay on for two years.

A Royal Navy spokesman said: 'The briefing material given to potential recruits does mention temporary medical conditions that would bar them from entering the Service, however braces is not specifically listed.

'The Service does provide emergency dental and medical cover, but there is no time in an already packed schedule for new recruits to be released to attend orthodontic appointments at home.

'Once the braces are removed, there is no reason that the individual cannot reapply (unless it is within 12 months, then they do not have to re-apply), providing, of course, they pass the rest of the medical.' 

But the family's MP David Ward said: 'This sends out a poor message on the competence of the Royal Navy.

'Needing your teeth straightening isn't a medical condition, you'd hardly call a brace a medical aid - it's a cosmetic aid.

'It's almost beyond belief that no-one at any point has pointed it out to him right until the very end.

'I will see what I can do to help, If necessary I will contact the Royal Navy on his behalf.'
