Omar Ammouche was charged after counter terrorism police raided a number of properties on Friday morning

The 33-year-old Greenacre man was arrested when police raided a home on Chiswick Road 

The man has been refused bail to appear in Parramatta Bail Court on Saturday

The 21-year-old attended Surry Hills Police Station on Friday where he was arrested at 2.30pm  after counter-terrorism police seized a rifle, two shotguns and a large amount of ammunition at a Condell Park house in Sydney's west on December 18.

The two men, who are not co-accused, did not appear when their cases were mentioned in Parramatta Local Court on Saturday.

It comes as the raids were carried out in Sydney's southwest, in relation to Operation Duntulm which is part of the Joint Counter Terrorism Team, and allegedly seized a number of items including a quantity of prohibited drugs and documents.

It was the same operation which saw the arrest of Mohamed Elomar's wife, Fatima, at Sydney Airport on May 3 when she was trying to board a flight to Malaysia with her four children. 

It is part of Operation Appleby, which is investigating  domestic terrorism and foreign incursions in Syria and Iraq.

Other warrants were executed in Leppington, Condell Park and Punchbowl. 

Police allege that a quantity of prohibited drugs were seized from another man in Punchbowl.

A NSW Police statement said the raids were executed 'not as a result of any specific terrorism threat'.

Operation Duntulm is an ongoing Joint Counter Terrorism Team (Sydney) investigation into alleged financial assistance and support being provided for foreign fighters overseas. 

Assistant Commissioner Mark Murdoch, Commander of the Counter Terrorism and Special Tactics Command said Operation Duntulm the raids are a timely reminder that police 'will not become complacent, and remain committed to disrupting criminal activity'.

'The operation today is about the gathering of evidence and intelligence to enable us to take action against those who think they can engage in these activities,' he said.

'Investigators this morning seized a range of items from the premises searched including documents and computers, and these will be forensically examined. 

'It doesn't matter who you are or what you believe in, if you choose to illegally fight in an overseas conflict you are not only breaking the law, you are placing yourself in immense danger.'

Australian Federal Police Acting National Manager Counter Terrorism Peter Crozier said community safety was the primary objective of all Joint Counter Terrorism Team activities.

'The priority for all agencies involved in these operations is to ensure the safety of the community, and we encourage all people to speak to us if they have any concerns or have information they wish to provide,' Acting Assistant Commissioner Crozier said

'Now more than ever, it is important for the community and police to continue to work together and promote the diverse, inclusive and supportive society we have here in Australia.'  

Counter terrorism police have raided a number of properties on Friday morning in relation to an ongoing operation which saw the arrest of Mohamed Elomar's wife, Fatima (pictured), at Sydney Airport on May 3

Mohamed Elomar's wife, Fatima, was arrested at Sydney Airport on May 3 when she was trying to board a flight to Malaysia with her four children

Mrs Elomar was then charged with preparing for incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities. She has denied the charges

Mr Elomar (pictured) is believed to have flown to Syria late last year with Khaled Sharrouf, a convicted terrorist, who fled the country on his brother's passport

Back in May, officers from Operation Duntulm arrested and charged Mohamed Elomar's wife, Fatima, with preparing for incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities. She has denied the charges.

Her husband, Mohamed Elomar, is believed to be fighting with terror group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. 

Mr Elomar is believed to have flown to Syria late last year with Khaled Sharrouf, a convicted terrorist, who fled the country on his brother's passport. 

Ms Elomar's property was not one of those raided by police. They raided one property in Greenacre and seized items not related.

The raids come after 800 police from The Joint Counter Terrorism Team were involved in searching a number of homes in Sydney and detained 15 people, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.
