A new Edward Snowden documentary has confirmed suspicions held by the Obama administration that there is a second National Security Agency whistleblower  leaking government intelligence.

The revelation reportedly comes during a major scene of Citizenfour , a documentary made by director Laura Poitras that follows the former government contractor from before he leaked thousands of classified documents last year through to the present day.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Glenn Greenwald - the journalist who first brought the Snowden files to public attention and Poitras' reporting partner - is the one who reveals the news on-camera to Snowden, whose mouth gapes open in shock.

Greenwald - who now runs website The Intercept, launched in the wake of the Snowden scandal, from Rio de Janeiro - attended the film's world premiere alongside Poitras in New York on Friday night.

In August it was revealed the government suspected a second leak after a story that was published by The Intercept.

CNN reported at the time that the proof was in documents obtained for the article about US government surveillance of suspected terrorists, which is dated August 2013 - months after Snowden fled first to Hong Kong and then to Russia to escape spying charges.

In addition to The Intercept's report, two articles in the German press had reported on US national security and spying issues without citing Snowden - adding to the theory that the notorious whistleblower is not the only leak.

'That's particularly notable given that virtually every other article using Snowden documents - including der Spiegel - specifically identified him as the source,' Greenwald said in an email to The Hill in July. 

Greenwald says in Citizenfour that the person is higher in rank than Snowden.

However nothing else is known about the second leak who is providing secrets to journalists. 

The Intercept also said the government has a list of one million names collected on a database called the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE).

It claimed there was one watchlist with 680,000 names on it that are under surveillance by the government.

The site said that 40 percent of the people have no affiliation to terrorist groups.

Poitras says in her documentary that she is on the list. 

The list has basically doubled since the underwear bomber plot to destroy a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day in 2009.

The justification for this is that the would-be bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmuttalab was not on any watchlists at the time that could have had a chance of preventing the attack.

Concern: President Barack Obama and his administration were already convinced there is a second source leaking government secrets to journalists

Snowden is wanted in the United States under the Espionage Act.

He now lives in Russia, where he was granted a three-year residency.

Snowden, Greenwald and Poitras spent eight days holed up in a Hong Kong hotel room nutting out the first stories that revealed Snowden to the world, all of which is covered in Citizenfour.

Snowden did not tell anyone what he was doing when he abruptly left the US.

He told his girlfriend, dancer Linsday Mills, with whom he lived with in Hawaii, that he was going on a work trip.

At the time Poitras was several years into making a film about surveillance in the post-9/11 era when she started receiving encrypted e-mails from someone identifying themself as 'citizen four', saying he was about to blow the whistle on U.S. government surveillance programs.

Greenwald was also contacted, and in June 2013 he and Poitras traveled to Hong Kong to meet 'citizen four', who introduced himself as Edward Snowden.

Poitras filmed a lot of the meetings, which makes up a large chunk of her film.  

Marketed as a 'real-life thriller,' it is the first of several films in the works about Snowden, who is wanted by the United States on charges brought under the Espionage Act.

Speaking in the film, Snowden says: 'I already know how this will end for me, and I accept the risk.'

Poitras, speaking after the screening, said: 'This was a film we had to make as privately and secretly as we could.'

Leaker: Snowden has claimed political asylum in Vladimir Putin's Russia. He is wanted in the US 

'We very much wanted to communicate in this film that [it] was about people who take risks and come forward at huge personal sacrifice.'

Poitras, an American, now lives in Berlin, Germany.

She has been stopped and questioned when entering the U.S. numerous times in the past 10 years.

Snowden's revelations sparked a global debate on the limits of privacy versus the needs of national security.

His critics view him as a traitor who refuses to face trial in the U.S. for his actions, while supports see him as a hero who spoke up for civil liberties.
