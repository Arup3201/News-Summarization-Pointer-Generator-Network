The court heard that the box had been hollowed out and contained 1.46 kg of the class A drug.

He was given unconditional bail until his trial date at the same court on May 30.

Allegations: Officers allegedly found the cocaine in a hollowed out box of Jamaican patties at Birmingham Airport

When considering sentences, courts take into account the nature of the role in the trafficking, looking at whether the smuggler was the main party behind the act or played a lesser role - such as being ordered to carry out the task.

The court also looks at the quantity of drugs smuggled, with 1-5kg of a class A drug such as Cocaine deemed a category two offence.

This level carries a minimum sentence of five years a maximum of 13.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
