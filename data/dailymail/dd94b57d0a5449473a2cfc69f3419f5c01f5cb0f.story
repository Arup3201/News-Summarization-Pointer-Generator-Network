The next-generation graphics of the upcoming virtual reality head-mount called Oculus Rift has taken an unassuming mother by surprise.

YouTube user Jeff Cousins fitted the device to his mum, who is featured at the beginning of an amusing video commenting on the virtual characters seated beside her before cackling with laughter.

The camera shows an image of what the woman is seeing on the screen, while she comments on the shoes that she is 'wearing' in the virtual setting.

After the mother states that she is ready to begin the game, entitled Cyber Space, her son presses the play button and a safety bar lowers in front of her.

Immediately the woman starts screaming and laughing in excitement as the giant swing ride pulls her backwards fast before virtually throwing her forwards.

In between laughter she shouts: 'Don't let me hit that pole!' 

Seemingly blown away by the technology, the mother looks genuinely panicked as her son instructs her to look around to make the most of the experience.

The Oculus Rift is still being developed but is believed that it will be released sometime this year

Later in the video the woman stretches out her arms and reaches for a rail to hold onto as the ride picks up speed and becomes even more thrilling.

Those around her laugh and point to her hands, which firmly clutch the chair she is sitting on for support.

As the ride comes to an end, the mother appears to be genuinely amazed by the experience.

'It looks like real,' she tells her children. 'It looks like I'm going to fall down in there.'

Oculus Rift is still being developed by Oculus VR but is expected to be made available sometime in 2015.

Founded by Palmer Luckey, the device was released in the form of two development kits – the DK1 in 2012 and DK2 in 2014 – to give developers a chance to create content in time for its official release.

And a number of virtual reality enthusiasts have also been able to get their hands on these development issues.
