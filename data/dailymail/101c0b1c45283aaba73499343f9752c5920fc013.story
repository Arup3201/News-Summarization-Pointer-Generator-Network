Manu Tuilagi, all tribal tattoos and rippling muscles, is seen as the human wrecking ball of the  England rugby squad set to play Ireland in Dublin today.

Recognised around the world as one of the most exciting talents in the game, the 6ft and 17st Manu will be hoping to make a huge impact on this year’s Six Nations tournament following his return from injury.

But back in the small beach village of Fatausi-Fogapoa, on the Samoan island of Savai’i where he grew up, the 21-year-old is far from being the most conspicuous member of the Tuilagi clan. For there it is his equally strapping 6ft brother Olotuli who catches the eye – dressed as a woman and known as Julie.

Julie is the third eldest of seven boys in the Tuilagi family – five of whom have professional rugby careers, including Manu, the youngest, who plays for Leicester Tigers.

Julie, 34, has previously shied away from media attention. But now in her first interview, given exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, she has told of her delight when Manu buys her make-up and designer handbags. And she explains how she has steered clear of the sport which dominates her family – happy instead to stay at home and do the ironing for her elderly parents.

‘Never in my life have I played rugby,’ she shudders. ‘I’m not a very rugby lady. My favourite sport is netball. However, if I played professional rugby then I would do better than the others. I am a very strong woman!’

She may joke about her physical strength, but Julie – who enjoys strutting around in perilous stilettos and has a passion for glamorous dresses – certainly exhibits a stoutness of character.

In the UK, Julie would be described as a transvestite and her striking looks would command significant attention. But in Samoa, she attracts barely a second glance because of the deep-rooted Polynesian culture of the fa’afafine, or third gender, which defies Western sexual conventions.

Known for their hard work and dedication to the family, the fa’afafine – which translates simply as ‘in the manner of woman’ – are ubiquitous in the South Pacific nation. Born male, they are said to embody both genders and can have relationships with both men and, less commonly, women.

Julie remains silent on her relationships and will only bashfully describe them as ‘confidential’. But she resolved from a very young age to live as a woman, apparently without difficulty.Julie grew up knowing she was different in a well-respected family. Her father, Tuilagi Vavae, was a former politician and the high chief of the village council, while her mother, Aliitasi, ran the local food shop.  ‘I was born a fa’afafine,’ Julie explains, simply. ‘I realised I was a fa’afafine when I was really young. It’s natural.

‘When I grew up, I did lots of girly things. I wore a girl’s dress and my parents let my hair grow long, even when I was at primary school.’

It is inconceivable to most parents in Britain that their son could happily attend school dressed as a girl. But in Samoa, Julie says, it was unremarkable. ‘I always played with girls and I always hung around with them. There were lots of my fa’afafine friends who used to go to school together.

‘My parents understand the life of fa’afafine, they understand and accept me – the boys do too.

‘I feel sorry for those people who discriminate against us. We do not have a problem – they are the ones with the problem.’

In a recent interview, Manu said of Julie: ‘It’s just the way he is. He was born like that and he wants to dress up as a woman. But not just dress up, he lives the life of a woman – he has the eyelashes, eyebrows, has make-up done and wears a bra. It doesn’t matter. He’s our brother and a great guy. He is just different.’

Growing up, Julie dedicated herself to helping her parents around the house, taking on the role of dutiful daughter. It is a respected part of the fa’afafine tradition and Julie has accepted it gladly.

‘I cook for them, I tidy, I iron their clothes. That’s the life of a fa’afafine in Samoa,’ she explains. ‘They help and do everything in the family.’ Julie is, in effect, gay as she is attracted to men. Some of Julie’s friends have embarked on surgery to become more feminine and to formally change genders. Julie has not so far made this decision, but has not ruled it out. ‘Some of my fa’afafine friends have had their full operation and got married. I haven’t had any surgery but maybe in the future, if I want to.

‘For me, I would rather stay alone and keep myself as a princess rather than become a slave of some kind. If I am thinking of getting married, then I’m getting married to a man. I haven’t made up my mind. I want to stay alone at the moment.’

Despite her domestic commitments, Julie has an openly flamboyant side.

‘Of course I dress up,’ she admits. ‘When we  go out, I dress up like  a princess, I dress up like a model. Everywhere I go – nightclubs, town – I dress up like a supermodel. It’s my personal choice.

‘Manu and I are very close. We respect each other because we are from a very respected family. My family support me. Without them, I would never dress up like this.

‘I’m the only princess in the Tuilagi family, but if Manu wants to wear one of my dresses that’s all right, no problem.’

But while Julie enjoys nightclubs, she also holds some deeply rooted religious beliefs. The Tuilagi family are regular churchgoers and, when Julie spent the period between 2003 and 2006 living in Leicester with her rugby-playing brothers, their parents would ring on Sundays to make sure they were going to church.

At the time, Julie’s brothers Freddie and Henry were playing for Leicester Tigers, a third brother Andy was also living in Leicester, and Alesana was playing in Italy.

It is clear that living as a woman, in the body of a muscular, tall Samoan man in the middle of Leicester, was particularly hard.

‘Discrimination was worse when I was in England,’ she admits. ‘When I met some people, I could tell by their body language that they rejected me. I could tell that, when I left, they would be talking behind my back. I don’t care.

‘I would always stand in the VIP queue at Life nightclub in Leicester. People would ask me why I would  stand in that line and I would answer, “Because I’m the VIP girl”.’

These days, Julie has returned to Samoa, where she and her parents live in a three-bedroomed home. Life is far easier in a Samoan culture where she is understood.

‘We have a big fa’afafine association here,’ says Julie. ‘We have a beauty pageant annually and we donate all the money to those who have special needs. Lots of my friends are fa’afafine, but I can be friends with anyone.

‘I am very happy as the kind of person I am.’

It is also surprisingly easy for Julie to buy clothes. ‘Most of the goods in Samoa are imported from America so they have sizes for fa’afafine. I’m size 16. I know how to maintain my body.’

Meanwhile, Manu has built his rugby reputation. He began playing with Rumney RFC’s youth team while living in Cardiff in 2004, after brother Freddie switched to the Cardiff Blues.

At 15, Manu moved back to Leicester, winning a place at the Leicester Tigers academy, but after three years and on the verge of signing a professional contract, it was discovered that he had long overstayed his six-month tourist visa.

The rest of his family were here legally, and local politicians and the local newspaper lobbied to keep Manu in the UK on the basis that he had the potential to play for England. He finally won indefinite leave to remain in July 2010 and in August 2011 made his England debut. He was later selected for England’s World Cup squad for the tournament in New Zealand.

His decision to play for England, rather than Samoa, caused some controversy back in his homeland, but Julie is still incredibly proud. ‘Manu has made history. It’s a rare opportunity for any islander to play in the England team.’

In fact, Julie is proud of all her rugby-playing brothers.

‘When they play, they put all their heart and effort into it, with the talent that God gave them. When they come home, we live like a normal family. We joke, we play, we party, we go out.

‘My relationship with Manu and my brothers is fine. We enjoy being together and they respect me.

‘They buy me designer handbags on my birthday, like Chanel or Gucci. Manu got me a big box of cosmetics from Dior. He also gave me Dolce and Gabbana perfume and some handbags.’Julie will be watching when England play Ireland today in their Six Nations clash, and it is clear there are no hard feelings between Samoa and its famous son.

‘I am very excited about the Six Nations. We are all proud of Manu,’ Julie says. ‘All my relatives and the people of my village cheer for England because they know Manu is their flag-carrier.

‘We are all for England here when Manu’s playing.’
