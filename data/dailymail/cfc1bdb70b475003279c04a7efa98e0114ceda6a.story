Fernando Torres scored in Spain's 2-0 win over Bolivia on Friday night and could have scored a brace but for a horror miss.

The striker timed his run impeccably to latch on to an exquisite Andres Iniesta through ball and, with just the keeper to beat, looked certain to score.

However, attempting to delicately chip the ball over the head of Boliva stopper Romel Quininez with the outside of his boot, Torres instead sent the ball high and wide in the opposite direction.

Torres immediately put his hands to his head after completely misdirecting the ball.

The Chelsea attacker has struggled for form having signed for the Blues in a Â£50million deal from Liverpool back in January 2011.

Despite this miss, Torres did get himself on the scoresheet with a well-taken penalty five minutes into the second half of Spain's penultimate World Cup warm-up match.

Bolivia, who failed to qualify for the World Cup finals, had managed to hold out until half-time before Javi Martinez was bundled over in the penalty area and Torres calmly slotted home the resulting spot-kick.

Having scored a paltry 20 goals in 110 appearances for Chelsea, Torres' penalty was the forward's 37th goal in 107 appearances for Spain.

Iniesta got the second to make sure of the victory, showing his class as he surged forward in the 84th minute and curled a low effort in off the post.

'It's always much better to travel (to a major tournament) with good feelings,' Iniesta said in an interview with Spanish television broadcaster Cuatro.

'We worked well and the conclusions from the game are positive.'

'The season has been very demanding and we have a lot of matches under our belts but what we have ahead of us is sufficiently exciting and different.'

Spain were missing their Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid contingent, who are on holiday following their clash in Saturday's Champions League final and will join up with the rest of the squad on Monday.
