A lack of exercise means British women are among the most likely in the world to suffer from three forms of cancer

A lack of exercise means British women are among the most likely in the world to suffer from three forms of cancer.

The UK has the tenth highest rate of bowel, breast and womb cancer out of more than 180 countries, research has found.

Experts said that poor physical fitness is increasing women’s risk of developing the three forms of the disease, all of which are linked to a lack of exercise. 

‘These figures reflect the sedentary lifestyles of many people in Western countries, with lots of us spending too much time sitting around and not incorporating physical activity into our daily routine,’ said Dr Rachel Thompson of the World Cancer Research Fund.

Britain had 133 cases of bowel, breast and womb cancer per 100,000 people, the statistics showed.

Barbados had the most out of the nations studied, while the Bahamas had the ninth highest rate.

But Dr Thompson said data collection from these two countries was less reliable than in Western Europe and the US, and the numbers affected were far smaller.

In effect, this means that the UK has the eighth highest rate, topped only by Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Iceland, Luxembourg and the US. Britain fared worst when it came to breast cancer.

For this form of the disease alone, it had the seventh highest rate out of the countries studied, the International Agency for Research on Cancer statistics showed.

Scientists estimate that about 12 per cent of bowel and breast cancer cases could be prevented if people were more physically active.

For womb cancer, the figure is at least 10 per cent.

Britons are advised to do 150 minutes a week of moderate activity, such as gardening. This is thought to help by allowing people to stay slimmer, which cuts the amount of cancer-promoting hormones produced by body fat.

However, just 36 per cent of women meet the moderate exercise target. Dr Thompson added: ‘It is a major concern that women in the UK are placed so highly in the world for cancers that are partially preventable through people being more physically active.

‘Regular activity can help strengthen the immune system, keep hormone levels healthy and the digestive system in good shape, all of which help reduce our chances of developing cancer.’

Last year, US researchers  found women who walk for an hour a day can cut their risk of breast cancer in later life.

Those who took part in vigorous activity received almost double the protection.

A spokesman for Breakthrough Breast Cancer said: ‘We’ve known for some time that being active can reduce a woman’s risk of breast cancer.‘We advise that 30 minutes of moderate physical activity a day, or 3.5 hours a week, can reduce breast cancer risk by at least 20 per cent.

‘Any activity that raises your pulse reduces your risk – so regular brisk walks are an easy and free way to get active.’
