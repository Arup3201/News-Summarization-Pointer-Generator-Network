Lisa Snowdon's actor boyfriend has admitted attacking her in the street, it was revealed today.

Adereti Monney, 38, was accused of pushing the radio and TV star up against a wall in Camden, north London, The Sun on Sunday reported.

Miss Snowdon, 42, reportedly did not press charges and has stuck by him. But the February attack was witnessed by a police officer who reported it.

Argument: Lisa Snowdon was reportedly assaulted in a London street in the early hours by her boyfriend Adereti Monney (pictured together last week)

Monney - also known as Tim Wade - later appeared at Highbury Magistrates' Court and admitted 'assault by beating'.

He was given a conditional discharge and ordered to pay £100.

A spokesman told the MailOnline: 'They
had had an argument which led to a very minor scuffle in the street.

'At no
point did Lisa press charges or indeed wish to press charges and the couple
have moved on from the incident.'

Guilty: The actor later admitted 'assault by beating' after pushing the radio star, out on Friday, up against a wall in Camden, The Sun on Sunday has revealed

The Capital FM DJ is thought to have started dating Andereti - who has appeared in films Knife Edge and Rollin' With the Nines - in January and the incident is said to have happened a month later.

The couple were last pictured together on Tuesday of last week when they attended a private view of Marc Chagall: Exhibition of Masterpieces at the capital's Opera Gallery.

Dating since January: 'They were on their way home when they got into an argument. He pushed her against a wall and was seen doing so by a policeman,' a source said

Miss Snowdon and Monney were coordinated in matching white tops, with the former looking chic in a blazer and pale, flared jeans.

The Weekend Kitchen host opened up about her life and dating will.i.am's communications manager last month, telling the Sunday Express: 'My weekend begins on a Friday afternoon with a massage. It’s great to get myself realigned after a busy week. Afterwards, I head home and get ready to go out with my girlfriends.

'We usually have champagne or cocktails first and then eat at Coya on Piccadilly. Sometimes we finish the evening off at Shoreditch House or dancing at Cirque le Soir in Soho.'

Monney is also head of communications and lifestyle at will.i.am's fashion and technology brand i.am+.
