Tragedy: Stephanie Becker fell to her death from the top floor of a luxury apartment building in New York

Heartbreaking new details about the successful businesswoman who fell to her death from a New York highrise on Thursday have emerged which suggest that the tragic death could have been a suicide.

Friends and family of 28-year-old Stephanie Becker have insisted that the Ivy League graduate was a happy person who would not have taken her own life.

But her neighbours in the building in Manhattan's exclusive Chelsea neighbourhood now say they believe she might have jumped to her death - and rumours are circulating that it was not her first suicide attempt.

A source, who did not want to be named, said: 'Everyone who lives here is in so much shock over this, it's really put us on edge.

'I heard that a few people in the building saw her fall and hit the ground.

'There has also been talk that she was wheeled out of the building several months ago on a gurney after an apparent suicide attempt.

'But no one really knows the full story.'

Ms Becker did not leave a suicide note, and officials have not confirmed that the 30-storey fall which killed her was deliberate.

Ms Becker fell from the roof of 55 West 26th 
Street at about 8.15am.

Originally from Stamford, Connecticut, she worked for IBM as a strategy
consultant, having achieved a degree from the University of Pennsylvania and an MBA from New York Stern.

She was an attractive, popular young woman, active within the Jewish community, and had traveled the world.

Friends and family described her as 
sweet and friendly. Rabbi Menachem Schmidt, who works as the director of
Lubavich House at the University of Pennsylvania, said she was 
‘wonderful’ and ‘happy', another friend described her as a 'sweet girl, really nice'.

The Chabad on Campus president also told The Algemeiner that she was a ‘beloved friend to many,’ and that the two of them had spoken within the past week.

Rabbi
Schmidt added that she went on a Birthright trip to Israel. 'She 
was a beloved friend to many,' he said. 'She was a social linchpin, 
somebody that everybody knew and related to, she was the best.

‘It is really, really hard to understand this. I feel sick, 
we all cared for her very much and I want people to remember her 
positively.’

Ms Becker's Facebook photographs show
that she has ventured across the globe, taking trips to Singapore and Colombia among other destinations.

Ms Becker attended Westhill High 
School in Stamford, before going to college and then joining IBM in July
2006.

She earned her MBA while employed with the firm, according to the New York Post.

Ms Becker posted a message on Facebook 
saying: 'I chew gum louder than you talk. But don’t ask me to quiet 
down. I am NO negative nancy. I roll with the punches.'

She also listed some of her favourite quotations on the site, which included the phrase, 'Cute Citayyyyyyy.'

Ms Becker volunteered to help Jewish students at the University of Pennsylvania and other universities, according the Post.

At work, she was experienced with advertising within video games, and even helped write a piece appearing in AdWeek in 2008.
