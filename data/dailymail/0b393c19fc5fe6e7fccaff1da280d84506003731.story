Samsung last night unveiled its latest flagship device, the Galaxy S3, the follow-up to last year's best-selling phone in the world.

The smartphone market moves on once more, with the hi-tech voice-controlled Galaxy S3 likely to becomes a standard-bearer for Google’s Android operating system - and a device for the Apple refuseniks.

The phone’s most innovative feature is built-in face-tracking and voice control - allowing, Samsung claims, for a more 'natural' control system.

Other innovations include what Samsung claims is a 'more intelligent' lock system, that keeps the screen 'awake' when the phone’s camera senses eyes watching it, rather than turning it off.

The voice control system is called S Voice - and allows access to weather forecasts, web searches and scheduling, similar to iPhone’s Siri system.

Saying 'I want to take a picture' launches the camera application - and will work in eight languages at launch.

S Voice can also reply out loud - which Samsung claims will allow the system to be used while driving.

Available in blue and white, the phone will be launched at the end of May, starting in Europe, with other regions following.

Samsung played on its expertise in screens with a large 4.8-inch Super AMOLED screen running a resolution of 1280 x 720p - far bigger than Apple’s iPhone, and close in size to the smaller end of the tablet market.

The S3 is powered by a quad-core processor - similar to the ones found in many laptops, and far more powerful than the dual core found in the iPhone.

The phone also includes an NFC chip - near-field-communications - allowing users to share content such as video by tapping phones together.

And if you are sick of wires, a separate wireless charging kit means you can charge your phone without hooking it up to the socket.

Mail Online science editor Rob Waugh gets hands-on with the S3:

The screen isn’t quite the match of some Android rivals such as Sony’s new Xperia S, but on every other count, this is a uniquely desirable device - and likely to set the pace for Apple’s next iPhone.

The speed of the quad-core processor is detectable in every app, with the new version of Android giving everything a satisfyingly sci-fi 'Tron'-like feel, and the screen is absolutely huge - with the extra space particularly useful when panning through photos with a fingertip.

It is also not massively bigger than its predecessor the S2, despite the vast screen - although anyone switching from an iPhone will definitely notice the difference.

This blurs the line between phones and tablets - and pulls off the feat with verve.

It's also packed with hidden treats - tapping two phones to trade videos between them at 300mbps is probably no more than a novelty, but it's a good one.

Burst shoot outperforms a lot of dedicated digital cameras, with a held-down finger rattling out a machine-gun sequence of 20 pictures per second, then instantly picking the best using face detection.

The auto-call function’s another 'why hasn’t anyone done this' winner - if you’re looking at a text, for instance, then pick up the phone and put it to your face, it automatically calls the person who texted you.

It's smart - and it works.

Voice control, as ever, is a bit more take-it-or-leave-it - although it’s unfair to judge S Voice from a crowded and noisy convention centre.

It did at least bring up a weather forecast - but trying to persuade it to take a photo was far more difficult.

Overall, this is a gorgeous handset that’s likely to put more momentum behind Google’s Android.

Samsung has raised the stakes here - and Apple will have to do something truly special to beat this.

Samsung pointed out that while the 
screen is 22 per cent larger than the previous S2, the 'bezel' around it
 has been slimmed down, so that the gadget is barely bigger than its 
predecessor.

The gadget will launch on May 29 in Europe, and in 10 other
cities worldwide including Tokyo and Dubai.

The gadget also has some features clearly aimed at the
business market once dominated by BlackBerry.

On-device encryption will allow secure emails working within
business networks - catering for the new trend for businesses allowing
employees to 'bring their own' smartphones rather than using company phones.

The NFC chip will also be used for tap-to-pay mobile
payments, in partnership with Visa, with a 'virtual wallet' on the device
making payment simple.

The
 phone is also armed with a battery claimed to last longer than other 
devices  - despite a form factor which is 8.6mm thin and 130g in weight.

The phone has an eight megapixel camera - on a par with both iPhone 4S and the previous Galaxy S2.

The
 device was presented by Samsung president JK Shin, who said: 'There were a lot of
 rumours and speculation - some were right, and some were wrong.

'The 
Galaxy S3 is the best-in-class smartphone in the world.'

The
 phone was shown off by The Gadget Show’s Suzi Perry at a high-profile 
event at London's Earls Court exhibition centre - a large, clearly 
expensive stage show that had a distinct resemblance to Apple’s 
well-choreographed showings for new iPhones and iPads.

'This is the biggest launch event of the year,' said Perry.

Samsung is also to launch a range of pop-up shops which will show off the handset around Europe - announcing this in a way reminiscent of Steve Job's traditional, 'One last thing,' at their product launches.

A new feature called ‘Pop up Play’ 
enables multitasking - so that you can, for instance, put a video in a 
window on screen, then use other apps with the rest of the screen.

This sort of feature was previously the province of Windows or Mac machines, rather than phones.

The camera can also burst-shoot at speeds of up to 20 frames per second - faster than many pro-grade cameras.

The camera also automatically zooms in on faces by double-tapping the screen and a ‘best-shot’ mode auto-selects the best out of the burst.

The phone’s front camera can also shoot in HD - still rare in smartphones - and take still images at the same time.

Sharing photos with friends is also 
speeded up by face-recognition technology - which offers to 'share' 
photos with any friends detected in a photo using hi-tech face 
recognition, sharing either by text message or email, with a bubble 
popping up over each person's face with the option to send the photo to 
them.

The S2 is expected to cost around £35-£40 per 
month. Carphone Warehouse said their tariffs would start for £36 on a 
24-month contract.

The S3 also contains voice controls -
 which brings it up to speed with the iPhone's Siri - but users may be 
wondering if it will be another damp squib.

Despite
 the fun of Apple's Siri, most users prefer traditional controls over 
speaking to their phone, and the feature which launched the iPhone 4s is
 not used by many users.

The Samsung Galaxy S3 will be heavily promoted with a worldwide advertising campaign starting this week.

Samsung is now the biggest phone 
manufacturer in the world, and for this launch they took a page out of 
Apple's marketing guide and kept everything hush-hush.

Even
 Samsung's invite to journalists and enthusiasts for the launch in Earl's Court, London, played it quiet - simply inviting people to 
'come and meet the next Galaxy'.
