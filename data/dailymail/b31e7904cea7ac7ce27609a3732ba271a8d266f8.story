A prankster was branded a 'reptile' today after he admitted recording himself doing a vile NekNomination stunt by swallowing - a live frog and lizard.

Sheldon Jeans, 23, stripped to the waist and dressed in a 'Scouser' black curly wig and moustache before introducing the stunt to the camera.

During the 90-second-long clip, Jeans downed a glass of water filled with crickets, before putting a frog in the same vessel and knocking it back whole.

Sheldon Jeans swallowed a live frog and a lizard during the Neknomination stunt which he posted on Facebook

Jeans pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to the creatures under the 2006 Animal Welfare Act

Jeans, of Cowplain, Hampshire even apologises to the three inch long lizard before covering it with water and swallowing it whole.

Despite claiming he regurgitated the animals afterwards, Jeans became the first person to be successfully prosecuted for causing cruelty to any creature other than a fish, while taking part in the web craze.

He was ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid work after admitting causing unnecessary suffering to the animals, under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.

Portsmouth Magistrates' Court also ordered him to pay £1,200 in costs after changing his plea to guilty on the first day of his trial.

RSPCA inspector Alan Browning said: 'Unfortunately this isn't the first case we've had involving NekNomination, but it is the first to come to court that involved animals other than fish.

'The two small animals would have suffered considerably during this incident, going through the distress of being swallowed and coming into contact with stomach acids.

'We hope this sick game is now on the decline as it is just not acceptable to subject animals to this sort of ordeal.'

In the video, he said: 'Hello this is Sheldon Jeans with a NekNomination.

'As you can see on the table in front of me, I've got a glass full of crickets. I had to get little ones because the geezer thought I was buying these for myself.

'I've got myself a lizard and I've got myself a frog. I'm going to call this the "I'm a Celebrity, Get me Out of Here Nek Challenge." First up, for the crickets.'

Jeans zoomed the video camera onto to the frog so viewers could see that the amphibian was real 

He also showed viewers that he had put the lizard, pictured, into the bottom of his glass before drinking 

He also drank a glass full of crickets although these were not covered by animal protection legislation 

He then called the frog a 'little fellow', before swallowing it whole and declaring it 'f***ing lovely.'

He said to the lizard: 'Sorry mate, but you are next. In with the lizard, we'll have some of that. Add a little bit of water. Don't worry son, it's your turn.'

Jeans then posted the footage on Facebook, which led to people complaining to the RSPCA.

The only reason he was not prosecuted for killing the crickets during the 3 February stunt was because they are not covered under the Act. 

Jeans was fined £1,200 and ordered to complete 80 hours of unpaid community service following his stunt 

Last month, Will Williams, of Caernarfon, north Wales, was criticised after drinking 70cl of the 40 per cent whiskey ahead of what he called a 'weekend on the beer'.

Health experts say the reckless stunt - in which Mr Williams consumed at least 28 units of alcohol - could easily have killed him.

The video, which has gained nearly 400,000 views on YouTube, shows Mr Williams biting the seal from the bottle of liquor while his friends laugh in the background.

He then inserts a straw into the bottle to help the spirits go down quickly and knocks it back in less than 10 seconds.

After spitting on the floor, he then tells his friends 'Neknominate that', a reference to the recent internet craze that saw some killed after drinking large amounts of alcohol.

Many of the video's viewers went online to criticise Mr Williams for completing the stunt, which they pointed out could easily have been fatal.

In an earlier court case, bin man Paul Wooding of Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire was handed an 18-month conditional discharge after he swallowed live fish during a Neknomination stunt from February.

In the video, Wooding announces 'this is my Neknominate' before downing a pint glass of wine, gin, vodka, rum and lemonade - together with the fish. 

The footage came to the RSPCA's attention after it was seen on Wooding's Facebook page.

In it, after downing the cocktail, he nominates four other people to join the drinking game.

The Neknominate phenomenon is understood to have emerged in Australia, with Wooding's believed to be the fifth such case to come to court in connection with the craze.

After being interviewed about the video, Wooding later posted on Facebook: 'Some people's lives must be that sad and boring, to get any excitement they have to report me to the RSPCA for my Neknominate,' 

Wooding was also ordered to pay £500 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.
