It may look like a display of synchronised swimming but this pod of humpback whales is popping out of the sea in unison during a feeding frenzy.

Nature photographer Jon Cornforth, from Seattle, captured the remarkable images during a tour of Alaska’s Inside Passage.

The magnificent creatures broke the water’s surface to swallow large pockets of herring at the narrow passage of Chatham Strait, Alaska.

Tourists watched the spectacular moment humpback whales gathered off the coast of Alaska to feed on a school of herring

Humpback whales pop out of the water to swallow large pockets of herring at the narrow passage of Chatham Strait in Alaska

 With a diet of small schooling fish and krill, Humpback whales can grow up to 50ft in length and weight up to 70,000lb

The pod used the technique of bubble feeding to catch the school of fish. In this situation, approximately a dozen whales worked together and used bubbles to trap the herring at the water’s surface.

As they rise the whales swim to the surface with their mouths open to collect the herring - breaking head first into the air.

John came across the fascinating scene while leading a small tour group through the breath-taking area in America’s ‘last frontier’.

John Cornforth encountered the fascinating scene while leading a small tour group through the breath-taking area in America’s ‘last frontier’

He said: ‘I have observed humpbacks repetitively breach 25 or more times over the course of an hour, but most often they breach a few times and then stop.

‘The exciting thing about photographing the whales bubble-feeding is that they will feed every five to ten minutes for hours at a time, so they are constantly on the surface.’

Mr Cornforth says he frequently returns to Alaska to observe the whales and has 'experienced a few very close attacks'

Alaska's government says visitors can find a high concentration of humpback whales, more than 500 in total, at Inside Passage

Jon Cornforth says patience is required while photographing humpback whales as they are 'unpredictable in their direction and behaviours'

Mr Cornforth says he gets a thrill out of photographing humpback whales during a feeding frenzy because they are 'constantly on the surface'

‘They are unpredictable in their direction and behaviours, so I have to be very patient until they do something interesting or come surprisingly close.

‘Over the many years that I have spent observing them feed in Alaska, I have experienced a few very close attacks that are, shall we say, exhilarating moments, though, not usually photographically productive.’
