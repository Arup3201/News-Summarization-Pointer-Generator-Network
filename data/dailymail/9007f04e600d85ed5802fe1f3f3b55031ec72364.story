A woman who sadistically tortured a teenage boy and made him drink his own urine during a terrifying two-hour ordeal has been jailed for four years.

Kerry Howle, 26, forced the defenceless 15-year-old schoolboy to eat a mouldy sausage roll which she had spat on and coated in cigarette ash.

She smashed a glass ashtray over the head of the cowering teenager and made him lick up his own blood during the brutal attack on August 2, this year.

Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard that tattooed Howle subjected the teenager to the degrading ordeal after accusing him of talking about her mother who was battling cancer.

Howle, from Chesterton, Staffordshire, even made other youths attack the schoolboy and told him to lick his own blood up after one sickening blow.

Prosecuting, Heather Chamberlin said: 'She told him he was dead and threatened to have him kidnapped, kill his mum and cut her tongue out and stitch it to her own mum.

'She then hit him to the back of the head.

'She told him he had to lick the blood up.'

'This is not simply an assault... it is both mental and physical torture. An exercise in sadism on your part' Recorder Stephen Lowne

The court heard the victim asked to go to the toilet and Howle told another youth to go with him - where he was made to drink his own urine.

Howle also mentally tortured the boy by calling him explicit names and forced him never to talk about his horrific ordeal before finally letting him go.

She was jailed for four years after pleading guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm on the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons.

Sentencing Howle at Stoke-on-Trent Crown 
Court on Friday, Recorder Stephen Lowne said the prolonged assault was 
'one of the most dreadful offences of violence towards children' he had 
ever come across.

He added: 'This is not simply an assault occasioning actual bodily harm, it is both mental and physical torture.

'An exercise of sadism on your part.

'You were described as towering over 
him and he was cowering away from you, and the threats began. This was a
long process of intimidation.

'You engaged in gratuitous degradation of this young boy and caused others to join in against their will.

'These children were put through the most dreadful ordeal.'

Defending, Saleema Mahmood said her client had a history of violence.
