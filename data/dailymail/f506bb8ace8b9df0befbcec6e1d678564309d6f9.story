President Obama has formally nominated Caroline Kennedy as the next American ambassador to Japan.

Kennedy, who is the daughter of former President John F. Kennedy and famous first lady Jackie, was reportedly asked to serve as the next American ambassador for the country in April but it was confirmed today that the President has pressed forward with the nomination. 

The White House confirmed Wednesday afternoon that they submitted her name to the Senate and are due to make the announcement later today.

In the spotlight: Caroline Kennedy's name has been submitted to be the first woman appointed as American ambassador to Japan

Branching out: Edwin Schlossberg's design firm is based in New York so he is not expected to move to Japan alongside his wife of 27 years if she is confirmed as the Ambassador to Japan

She has been a perpetual consideration
for a number of political posts over the years, but this one comes at a
personal cost as her husband Edwin Schlossberg will not be joining her 
in Tokyo since his design firm is based in New York.

Turning point: The Kennedy endorsement of Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary effectively secured his win over Hillary Clinton

Their
26-year marriage has been the subject of speculation over the years 
since they are rarely seen together, but they were seen enjoying a beach
vacation in St Bart's over the girls' spring break earlier this year.

If the nomination goes through, she will become the first woman appointed to the post.

Political stars like form vice president Walter Mondale and former House speaker Tom Foley have filled the post previously, but Caroline Kennedy will bring a new level of glamor the job.

Kennedy, 55, has never actually held a governmental office, but her name has given her a great deal of weight in the political world.

She publicly toyed with the idea of 
running for the New York Senatorial seat left unfilled when Hillary 
Clinton stepped down to run for President in 2008, but Kennedy ended up 
withdrawing her nomination for 'personal reasons'.

Since
then, she has been an active Democratic cheerleader on the sidelines of
elections, supporting Barack Obama in both 2008 and then served as a 
national co-chair in the 2012 election.

Many political observers feel that the plum post is a reward of sorts for Kennedy as her decision to lend her family name to the Obama campaign in 2008 as opposed to siding with the Hillary Clinton, who would have been the country's first female presidential nominee, was seen as a turning point in the competitive Democratic primary.

Reconnecting: Caroline Kennedy, 55, was pictured with her husband Edwin Schlossberg during a family vacation in St Barts this April, right around the time that the vetting for her possible post began

Surviving Kennedys: Caroline, seen with (left to right) her children Tatiana, Jack and Rose, and her husband Edwin, is the sole surviving member of former President Kennedy's immediate family

Connections: Caroline has supported Barack Obama in both presidential elections, seen left in 2008 and then with First Lady Michelle Obama at her uncle's funeral in 2011 (right)

If
the nomination process goes smoothly, she will join the ranks of other 
famous family members who have served as ambassadors for the U.S.

Her
grandfather Joe Kennedy was the Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 
1938 to 1940 during Franklin Delano Roosevelt's presidency.

Joe's
daughter, and Caroline's aunt, Jean Kennedy Smith served as the 
American Ambassador to Ireland from 1993 to 1998 during Bill Clinton's 
two terms in office.

Though she has written a number of books and worked on boards of various Kennedy-related foundations, she is estimated to have a net worth of around $100million.

Lineage: Caroline is the only daughter- and only surviving relative- of President John F Kennedy and his wife Jackie

She married Edwin Schlossberg in 1986 and her now-deceased uncle Senator Ted Kennedy walked her down the aisle.

The couple have three children together- Rose, Tatiana and John, who goes by Jack like his grandfather before him.

Rose, 24, graduated from her mother's alma mater, Harvard University, and now works as an artist and videographer.

Tatiana, 22, is now a reporter for New Jersey newspaper The Record after graduating from Yale University. Her younger brother Jack, 20, is a sophomore at Yale and has said that he hopes to pursue a career in politics.
