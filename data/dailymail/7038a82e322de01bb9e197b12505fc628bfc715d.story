Married mother of two and fitness blogger Roni Noone was proud of her dramatic weight loss, so she carefully documented her progress in photos - which she now says have been stolen by a diet pill company for a second time.

According to Noone, the website Diets Digest lifted some of her before-and-after photos from a friend's Facebook page and has been using them to hawk a diet supplement called Garcinia Cambogia.

The 37-year-old mom, who shed 70lbs over the course of a year using the point system, extensively blogged about her journey from size extra-large to medium on the site Roni's Weigh, sharing photos every month and tracking her weight.

Dramatic change: Roni Noone started out weighing 200lbs and managed to shed 70lbs by eating healthier - but now a diet supplement company is using her likeness and fake quotes to sell pills 

Bogus success story: The site Diets Digest created a fake weight loss narrative using Noone's photos showing her progress

Magic pills: The website hawks diet supplements called Garcinia Cambogiamade from a tropical plant

False claims: The website selling plant-based supplements claims that Noone shed nearly 20lbs in a month

Recently, the Baltimore woman stumbled upon the Diets Digest site, only to discover her pictures along with a bogus first-person account of how she lost nearly 20lbs in a month thanks to the Garcinia Cambogia pills.

The website used a fake name in the success story featured on the homepage, complete with weight loss graphs and weekly updates, ABC News reported. 

According to the site, the supplements are derived from a tropical plant native to Indonesia called Garcinia Gummi-Gutta - a fruit the size of a grapefruit with a sour flavor to activate digestion.

The site markets two products: a colon cleanser that promises to boost metabolism and energy while blocking fat and suppressing appetite, and Lipo G3 Garcinia - a supplement that is supposed to promote cardiovascular and digestive wellness.

Diets Digest quotes Noone as saying that she decided to go on the Garcinia diet after seeing reports about it on CNN and the daytime talk show Dr Oz, and hearing about it from friends on Twitter and Facebook.

‘After the fourth week, my final results are shocking,’ one of the made-up quotes reads. ‘I lost an unbelievable 19 lbs since starting the Lipo G3 Garcinia and Regula RX Cleanse diet!’

Noone, who also runs the sites 
RoniNoone.com, a healthy recipes portal GreenLiteBites and a blogging 
community called BlogToLose, which has over 5,000 members, says what 
upsets her most is not the fact that her pictures were lifted without 
her permission, but that the pill company has been using her likeness 
the peddle a product that she had never taken.

‘If Garcinia Cambogia is so great then why do [these websites] feel the need to use fake stories and photos to sell the product?’ she wonders.

A similar thing happened to Noone last year when another company used the same pictures showing her at 200lbs and 130lbs to promote its supplements.

Precedent: Last year, another diet pills company used the same before-and-after photos featuring Noone to sell its products

Long journey: Noone, 37, documented her year-long weight loss on her blog Roni's Weigh

In that case, the 37-year-old blogger was able to contact the site and demand that her photos be removed.

According to Noone, the site then replaced her before-and-after snapshots with those of another person, but kept the narrative and the fake quotes unchanged.

But Diets Digest has no address or phone number listed. Noone filled out a comments form asking to pull down her photos, and she is still waiting for a response.

The fitness blogger has a growing online following, with over 11,000 fans on Twitter and 6,000 friends on Facebook.

Noone, who is married and has two kids, says she is upset that her images are being used to peddle pills she had never used

Painnstaking process: Noone, seen left weight 191lbs and right at her goal weight, says she shed her excess pounds by journaling about her food intake and eating healthier as part of the Weight Watchers program

On the site Roni's Weigh, Noone explained that her weight issues started when she was about 12 years old and continued on through high school and college. By the time she entered graduate school, Nooe tipped the scales at 200lbs.

She had tried every kind of diet, from fasting to Xenadrine, grapefruit and cabbage regimens, and finally Atkins. 

While she was pregnant with her first child in 2005, Noone put on 70lbs. Two weeks after delivering her son, Noone walked into Weight Watchers - a program she credits with teaching her how to maintain a healthy weight by eating better and journaling about her food intake.

‘I just don't think it's possible to sell weight loss in a bottle,’ Mrs Noone told ABC last August.
