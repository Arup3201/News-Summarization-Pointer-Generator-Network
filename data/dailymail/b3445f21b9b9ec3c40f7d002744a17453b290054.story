Formula 1 heiress Tamara Ecclestone is to marry a former stockbroker banned from working in the City for trading without ‘honesty and integrity’.

Jay Rutland, 31, proposed during a romantic holiday in Dubai following a whirlwind romance – and Miss Ecclestone has since been seen wearing a silver band on her ring finger.

Last year Mr Rutland was banned by the Financial Services Authority, which found he used inside information to boost sales of shares, and ‘watered down’ warnings about the risks to investors.

New love: Jay proposed to Tamara after a quick romance

The regulator ruled he ‘is not a fit and proper person [to be trading in the City] as his conduct demonstrates a lack of honesty and integrity’.

They imposed a £160,000 fine but reduced it to £30,000 after hearing of ‘Mr Rutland’s financial circumstances including a debilitating illness affecting his ability to work’ – but gave no further details.

Friends say he has come clean about his past with his new fiancee, whom he plans to marry as early as next year.

A friend said: ‘Tamara knows all about Jay’s background.

Jay has been honest from the start and she believes in people being given a second chance.

‘This all happened a long time ago.’

The FSA probed Mr Rutland’s sales methods when he worked for now defunct City trading  firm Pacific Continental Securities in 2007.

The engagement comes seven months after Miss Ecclestone split from businessman Omar Khyami, 41, after he was caught on a sex tape.
