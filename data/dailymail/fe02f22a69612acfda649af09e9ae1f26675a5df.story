A father and son have been arrested and charged with animal cruelty after they viciously beat their neighbor's German shepherd to death.

Kimberly Saesee says her beloved dog Kuma somehow got into Sam and Tony Clendenin's yard in Merced, California, on Friday evening. 

The pair then started hitting the animal with a baseball bat and flashlight as it lay cornered against wooden boards.

The horrifying act was caught in the Saesee's surveillance camera - but the suspects said their reaction was self-defense.

They were having a cigarette when the animal got into their yard. They trapped it next to a fence, fearing it would attack them, then started beating the dog. 

A devastate Miss Saesee told ABC 30: 'That could've very well been a person. How do you beat something living? I mean he was like family to us. He pretty much was a person to us. How do you beat someone to death?'

'I hope they go to prison. I don't think anyone should be able to do that to anyone or anything. It's not right. It's not right.' 

Sam, 24, told the station: 'I wasn't expecting to see a 200-pound dog growling right in my face in the dark in my own backyard. I should feel secure. It's my property.

'It was on right then and there. I was on a landmine. I didn't know what to do. If I get my foot off this dog, it's going to charge. I already know that, so you need to help me. And the only thing that goes through his head is baseball bat.' 

The Clendenins were bailed out on Friday. Authorities have reportedly said that they do not believe it was self-defense as the pair have conflicting stories.
