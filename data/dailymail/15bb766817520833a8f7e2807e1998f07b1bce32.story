A judge has reinstated a sexual assault case against pitcher Evan Reed, overturning a decision by another judge who found inconsistencies in the woman's story.

Reed is charged with third-degree criminal sexual conduct.

He was playing for the Detroit Tigers last spring when a woman says she was drugged at a bar before Reed took her to a Detroit casino hotel on the eve of Opening Day.

Wayne County Judge Michael Callahan heard an appeal  Friday and reinstated the case. It had been dismissed in August.

Back then, a judge said the testimony of the woman who accused him wasn't credible and prosecutors failed to show that force or coercion took place.

'Her lies caught up with her,' Reed, who insists the sex was consensual, said after the hearing 

Reed said back then that he was 'elated' to be cleared of the third-degree criminal sexual conduct charges.

He was with the Tigers at the time of the incident and appeared in 27 games for Detroit before being sent to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. He's a free agent now.

Reed wasn't in court Friday. His defense attorney, Ben Gonek, said Reed was interrogated for hours and didn't commit a crime.

The 45-year-old woman testified that she met Reed at a bar in the suburb of Royal Oak on March 30 and that they later went to a casino in downtown Detroit.

She said she 'blacked out' after taking a drink that tasted 'sour' and that she believes had been drugged.

The Detroit Free Press reports that surveillance video from that night show the woman falling off a sidewalk onto her back without attempting to brace herself at all.

Reed is then seen carrying the woman into the hotel building.

But Judge Kenneth King said there was no evidence the woman was raped inside the hotel.

The judge said the woman appeared to be unimpaired when she walked down a set of stairs, despite claiming she didn't have the presence of mind to take the elevator.

'She wasn’t wobbling, she wasn't falling, she wasn't stumbling,' King said, according to reports. 'And she was wearing high heels.

Reed has insisted that the sexual encounter was consensual, while the alleged victim says she thinks she was drugged

The woman testified that she was on her third vodka tonic when she noticed the drink tasted particularly sour.

Her next memory is waking up naked in bed with Reed.

The woman described what happened in graphic detail after she awoke the following morning during her hour-and-a-half testimony.

'Everything was spinning, my head was hurting,' she said. 'I remember getting up and kind of holding on to the wall and going into the bathroom.'

She noticed a foul smell and a stain on the sheets; she said she got into the shower where Reed allegedly tried to have anal sex with her.

She told him no and went back to the bed. 'My mind was telling me all I wanted to do was go back and sleep,' she said, reports CBS.
