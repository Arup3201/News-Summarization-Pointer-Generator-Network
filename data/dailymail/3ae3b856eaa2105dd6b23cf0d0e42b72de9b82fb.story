The Detroit Pistons scored four points in the final 11 seconds against the San Antonio Spurs to rally for an exciting 105-104 victory in the NBA on Tuesday.

In the only other game, the Phoenix Suns scored 100 or more points for a ninth straight game in defeating hosts the Milwaukee Bucks 102-96.

In the final seven seconds in San Antonio, Pistons guard Brandon Jennings took a bad inbounds pass by Tim Duncan and drove the length of the court, weaving through San Antonio's defence to bank in an 11-foot jumper. The shot lifted Detroit to a sixth straight victory.

His bucket backed up double-doubles from Andre Drummond and Greg Monroe as the Pistons rallied from 18 points down in the first half.

'We are getting better,' Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy said. 'If you stay in there, sometimes you get a break. We had a very good break at the end. We got lucky at the end. Our resolve to stay in the game right down to the last few seconds was huge.'

Drummond had 20 points and 17 rebounds and Monroe added 17 points and 11 boards as the Pistons snapped a four-game losing run in San Antonio. DJ Augustin added 19 points for Detroit, who haven't lost since waiving Josh Smith on December 22.

San Antonio point guard Tony Parker played just 13 minutes on his return from a five-game absence due to a strained left hamstring. He was 0-for-3 shooting and had just two assists, but he did not appear to aggravate the injury.
