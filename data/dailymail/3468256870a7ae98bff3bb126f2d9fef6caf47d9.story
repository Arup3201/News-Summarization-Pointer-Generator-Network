Martha Stewart found herself in hot water this morning after she posted a completely nude photo of her four-year-old granddaughter Jude to her Twitter account from their family vacation.

'Jude looks great with her long blond hair braided - art session at 8.45,' the 73-year-old lifestyle mogul wrote with the image, which depicts Jude sitting on the floor with her back turned to the camera.

The image quickly became a source of outrage among her followers, with many tweeting their horror at the image’s content, prompting Martha to remove the offending image just 15 minutes after it was posted.

Posted: Martha Stewart found herself in hot water this morning after she tweeted a completely naked photo of her four-year-old granddaughter Jude from their family vacation, which Daily Mail Online has censored

Eldest granddaughter: Martha, pictured with Jude last May in New York, deleted the post 15 minutes later claiming she thought she had cropped the image

'Martha why is this child naked??' one response read, while another added: ‘Is there a specific reason she is naked?’

Martha quickly issued an apology for the error, saying: 'Sorry I thought I cropped the photo - we are on vacation!' That tweet has now also been removed from her account. 

Jude is the eldest of Martha's two grandchildren, the other being three-year-old Truman.

Both were born via a surrogate  to Martha's only daughter Alexis Stewart, a 49-year-old TV host and radio personality, who has spoken publicly about her struggle to conceive a child naturally.

Martha's Twitter followers were unified in their immediate responses following the nude snap.

'Really? Posting naked pictures of a child on Twitter? Really???' wrote one.

'I agree. Any idiot knows you can't put naked pics of kids on the internet', stated another.

A third commented: 'Please place proper clothing on this child and repost. Thank you'.

Backtracking: The 73-year-old lifestyle guru, who is on vacation in an unknown location, soon issued this apology (pictured), but deleted it less than an hour later

Outrage: Martha's followers were unified in their knee-jerk responses following the nude snap

Twitter's guidelines mention that they 'do not mediate content', and suggest, in regards to 'sensitive content such as nudity', that: 'For the most part, using common sense won’t steer you wrong.'

Following Martha's removal of the photo, one follower replied: 'Thank you dear', while another stated, 'I'm calling bulls***'.

Martha has since deleted her apology tweet too, and her latest post is now a snap of her vacation view.

'Resting with this view after a marathon Comedy Central taping the roast of justin bieber!!! You will see it 3-30'.

Time off: Martha showed off her luxurious view following her 'marathon taping' session of Comedy Central's Roast special, during which Justin Bieber will receive a public shaming from ten celebrity 'roasters'

The upcoming Comedy Central Roast special, airing on March 30, will see Justin Bieber, who has only just turned 21, receive a public shaming from ten celebrity 'roasters'.

Speaking ahead of the spectacle, Martha admitted to Entertainment Weekly: 'I have many, many reservations [about my jokes].'

'Please, everyone who knows me: I didn’t write this stuff. I’m going to say some raunchy stuff, but I just worry about what they’re going to say about me.'
