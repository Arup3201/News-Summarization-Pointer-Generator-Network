The head of the health service pleaded ignorance yesterday to damning evidence that patients were failed on his watch.

As he again faced down calls to quit his post, Sir David Nicholson was accused of presiding over of a ‘see no evil, hear no evil’ culture in the NHS.

This, the chief executive admitted, culminated in patients ‘not being at the centre of the way the NHS operated’. He insisted he remains the ‘right person’ to stay on and improve the service at a time when it is at ‘maximum risk’ owing to impending reform.

Under fire: Sir David Nicholson faced the Health Select Committee where he pleaded ignorance to damning evidence that patients were failed on his watch

But during a bad-tempered session in which he left MPs staggered by his evasiveness, Sir David revealed a startling lack of awareness about growing scandals in the NHS. He:

■ Admitted he had ‘no idea’ about the unfolding scandal at Stafford Hospital where 1,200 patients needlessly died – even though he was in charge of the regional health watchdog;

■ Claimed he had ‘no access’ to statistics revealing high death rates while he was running the local health authority, although records show they were viewed online by his colleagues;

■ Appeared unaware of the full extent of gagging orders against staff, saying he would never ‘sanction’ such a deal, even though nearly 600 were agreed on his watch;

■ Confessed he did not even read a series of critical reports written on the NHS by Labour’s Lord Darzi – even though they were commissioned during his time in charge.

Questioned by the Health Select Committee, Sir David made the candid but shocking admission that patients were not the main priority in the NHS, which had ‘lost focus’.

Sir David insists he is the 'right person' to stay and improve the service, despite growing calls for him to resign

He has faced growing calls to stand down after it became apparent that he failed to intervene while patients were dying of neglect in Stafford during his spell on a string of Midlands health authorities.

But he has clung on to his £211,000-a year job, insisting he is not ‘ashamed’ to carry on as the most powerful man in the NHS.

Yesterday, for the first time, he admitted personal failings which led to more than 1,000 unnecessary deaths between 2005 and 2009. However he claimed he had no indication patients were suffering and dying needlessly until it was exposed by regulators.

‘I had no idea,’ he said. ‘We didn’t see any of the information that would lead you to believe that there was all of this going on in Mid Staffordshire. As shocking as it is, that is the truth.’

Sir David said there was ‘no culture of sharing information’ in the NHS.

‘During that period, across the NHS as a whole, patients were not the centre of the way the system operated.’

He explained that the NHS ‘lost its focus’ because managers were busily chasing targets handed down by Labour. Sir David said that for a ‘whole variety of reasons, not because people were bad but because there were a whole set of changes going on and a whole set of things we were being held accountable for from the centre’, an environment was created where the leadership of the NHS lost its focus.

‘I put my hands up to that and I was a part of that, but my learning from that was to make sure it doesn’t happen again.’

The Prime Minister has given Sir David his full backing, insisting he is doing a ‘very good job’, but 40 MPs have so far signed or lent their support to a motion calling on him to go.

Polls have shown that as many as 90 per cent of healthcare professionals think he must resign. But Sir David began the session with a five-and-a-half minute monologue setting out why he should stay.

Tory committee member Dr Sarah Wollaston, a former GP, said the embattled chief executive appeared to have ‘powerful friends watching his back’.

She said he should not continue in his role after major NHS reforms are unveiled next month, as warning signs about the disaster had been ‘ignored’.

She added: ‘He claimed not to know about the extent of gagging clauses which are silencing NHS staff, claimed not to know about the climate of fear that was highlighted in three reports that were suppressed and only came to light because of a Freedom of Information request.

‘And I felt really the whole issue of did he understand about his own role in this, did he understand the anger of patients, that this mortality data was there, and it was ignored.’

Sir David said he regretted failing to meet patients and the ‘legalistic’ way they were treated.

On mortality rates showing a high number of unexpected deaths in Mid Staffordshire, which apparently failed to reach him, he claimed they were not widely used by trusts.

In fact these figures, showing the number of deaths at hospitals compared with what was expected, were published annually in national newspapers since 2001 and online since 2005.

Professor Brian Jarman, of Imperial College, London, who supplied them to health trusts and the Department of Health, said: ‘Staff accessed them thousands of times, although they did not know we were recording it. I find it very difficult to believe he was not aware of them.’

Gary Walker, former head of a health trust in Lincolnshire who was handed a £500,000 gagging order, said yesterday: ‘I complained to Nicholson personally and lost everything.’

Dr Wollaston said: ‘Everyone is saying the NHS can’t survive without David Nicholson because he’s supposed to have this amazing grasp of detail, but it’s more than a detail if more than a thousand people died in the hospital where you were head of the strategic health authority.

‘He didn’t take responsibility for much except not meeting the patients. I’m afraid very disappointed that all of these things were minimised and it was a case of hear no evil see no evil. 

Questions: The trio were being asked about the Mid-Staffordshire scandal, that cost the lives of up to 1,200 people

‘It was swept under the carpet. He’s determined to stay on and has a lot of powerful friends watching his back.’

Julie Bailey, 51, who set up the Cure the NHS campaign group after her mother Bella died in Mid Staffordshire, said: ‘We need to get rid of him.

‘Nothing will change. He is part of the problem, not the solution. That man is an absolute disgrace. He is desperate to carry on in his job.’

Andrew Bridgen, MP for Leicestershire North West, some of whose constituents died at Stafford, said: ‘If Sir David was the CEO of a private sector company where there were thousands of avoidable deaths, he wouldn’t be worried about resigning. He would be up on corporate manslaughter charges. He’s happy to take the pay but not the responsibility.’

Sir David was in charge of the regional health body supervising the Mid Staffordshire trust, and later head of the Department of Health, over the four-year period in which up to 1,200 are feared to have died needlessly

Four former Labour Health Secretaries have ridden to the defence of Sir David Nicholson – insisting there is no reason for him to resign.

Alan Milburn, Patricia Hewitt, Alan Johnson and Andy Burnham said there was no evidence he acted wrongly over the Mid Staffordshire scandal.

Labour is worried about Sir David’s fate as many of the decisions for which he has been criticised took place when it was in power. It was responsible for the target regime and the ‘culture of fear’ behind it that was blamed for managers in Stafford putting finance before patients.

Alan Milburn was the man who introduced 
the target regime, under which managers were given financial incentives 
for bringing down waiting times, in his 2000 NHS reform plan. He also 
introduced foundation trusts – it was Stafford’s desire to gain this 
elite status which led to the neglect of patient care. Neither Frank 
Dobson nor John Reid, Labour’s two other health secretaries during the 
Tony Blair years, responded to calls.

But their four counterparts were vociferous in their support. Patricia Hewitt said: ‘I have been appalled by the campaign against David Nicholson. It is grossly unfair.’

Alan Johnson said: ‘David Nicholson was part of the solution to raising quality in the NHS rather than the problem.’

Andy Burnham, now shadow health secretary, said: ‘The Prime Minister has said what he wants to say on David Nicholson and I think he is right.’

Mr Milburn spoke out in favour of Sir David even though he had never worked directly with him. He said: ‘The easiest thing is to always look for the kneejerk response, put a head on a platter and then everything is solved.’

Below we assess how Mr Milburn, Miss Hewitt, Mr Johnson and Mr Burnham fared themselves when they were in charge of Health.
