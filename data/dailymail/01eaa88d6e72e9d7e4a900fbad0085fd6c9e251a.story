An incredible hi-tech tabletop enables individuals to reproduce virtual versions of their own hands and small objects.

The inFORM table allows a person to wave their hands or move an object under some camera sensors so that their movements are replicated by small moveable bars placed in a grid formation that make up the tabletop.

The invention, by a team of U.S. scientists, might remind some people of a hi-tech version of a pin art toy they played with as children.

The inFORM system table allows a person to wave their hands or an object under some sensors and their movements are replicated by small moveable bars placed in a grid formation that make up the tabletop. Here, a demonstrator cups a red ball

The inFORM 'state-of-the-art shape display,' which was created by Professor Hiroshi Ishii and his students at the MIT Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and impressively, it works in realtime.

The 'tangible interface system' uses camera sensors from Microsoft's Kinect to read objects in three dimensions.

The inFORM 'state-of-the-art shape display' was created by Professor Hiroshi Ishii and his students at the MIT Media Lab. Here, a circular basket is placed under the sensors and is replicated on the table

This image shows the replication of the basket. The bars, which can move independently from one another, can also be lit and a red patch indicates where the ball in the 'real' basket under the sensors, is positioned

This information is then processed by a 
computer, to move the small bars placed in a grid pattern within the 
tabletop, which results very quickly in the replication of a person's 
hands or an object like a basket.

The researchers said the tabletop 'provides for variable stiffness rendering and realtime user input through direct touch and tangible interaction.'

In a video, demonstrating the innovation, the researchers use a ball to show how the table has the power to move an object around on its surface, using the dynamic bars.

The creators of inFORM (pictured) envision their innovation could be used to replicate objects remotely and even reproduce city maps, using 3D data. Here, a researcher show how he can move a ball on the table using his hands, which are read by nearby sensors

The scientists wrote in a research paper: 'We show how shape change can be utilised to 
manipulate passive objects. Mechanical forces can push objects, causing 
them to roll, slide, or tumble in one direction or another. Other 
constraints can be programmed to rotate or raise passive objects.'

The creators of inFORM envision their innovation could be used to replicate objects remotely and even reproduce city maps, using 3D data, which could mean you could one day take a 3D tour around a miniature, stylised city without leaving your desk, Spoid reported.

The researchers also note that as their shape display allows for more general purpose shape change than any competing shapechanging interfaces, it makes an 'ideal research platform' for scientists and engineers.

Professor Ishii leads The Tangible Media Group at the university, which explores how to seamlessly connect the 'dual world of bits and atoms by giving physical form to digital information'.

His team said: 'Our belief is that shapechanging interfaces will become increasingly available in the future.'

As well as replicating objects, mechanical forces that underpin the system of small bars, which make up the tabletop, can be used to push objects, causing them to roll, slide, or tumble in one direction or another, according to the scientists

The machine is composed of sensors (from Microsoft's Kinect), a projector, the 'shape display' bars in the table, pins and linkages, actuators (pictured) and a hefty computer
