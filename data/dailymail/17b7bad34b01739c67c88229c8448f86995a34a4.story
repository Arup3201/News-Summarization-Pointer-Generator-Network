West Ham striker Andy Carroll received a bigger shock than his harsh sending off against Swansea when he returned to the Upton Park dressing room...Sky Sports News’ glamorous presenter Charlie Webster was in the ice bath!

An exhausted Webster had been given full use of the Hammers physio and treatment facilities after finishing a 250-mile charity run via 40 football grounds in aid of Women’s Aid. She had taken a bow in the centre circle during half-time.

Webster was in the middle of a much-needed recovery session when Carroll came back prematurely after being given his marching orders on the hour. Sportingly, the striker allowed Webster to stay in the bath while he used an ice bucket for his post-match routine instead.

Expert care: Webster gets some treatment at Bolton Wanderers during her charity challenge

Webster, before the start of her marathon to highlight the battle against domestic violence, had revealed she had been sexually assaulted by her athletics coach when she was 15.

She infuriated some of her SSN colleagues last March when she posed scantily clad for lads mag FHM when Sky were promoting women in sport.

How long can the RFU justify their annual seven-figure spend on their 50-odd councillor blazers whose travel and accommodation to all Six Nations games are met by Twickenham?

The Paris trip included dinner on the Friday, lunch and dinner on the Saturday ands a lavish spread — foie gras and all — straight after the game. No wonder the other unions have refused to feed the English blazers’ partners.

Tradition: Stuart Lancaster has no qualms with the post-match Six Nations banquets

In these days of elite athlete management of all nutritional needs, it seems outdated that England’s rugby team still have to attend post-match Six Nations banquets.

Head coach Stuart Lancaster, has no complaints. However, England have brought in a strict 50-minute recovery time for players after games this season to ensure they’re not rushed off to dine with the blazers.

Premiership rugby were making great play that January 31 was the deadline for sorting out the European club impasse or they would go their own way.

However, such is the dysfunction, the RFU high command in Paris felt under no such time pressure to find a solution with the Six Nations kicking off.

Members of the Lords and Commons all-party rugby team could be seen downing the San Miguels soon after leaving St Pancras on the 7am Eurostar last Friday and were still going strong well past midnight in the bars of St Germain in Paris.

In the circumstances, the side, led by scrum-half Labour MP Paul Farrelly, did well to draw 10-10 with the French Parliamentarians the following day.

England have got it clicked

England cricket’s over-reliance on 
sports science analysis is seen as one area where the Andy Flower-led 
regime might have got it wrong during the Ashes debacle.

The
 array of desktop screens, laptops and tablets operated by two 
performance analysts in front of Stuart Lancaster, Andy Farrell and 
Graeme Rowntree at the Stade de France shows the appliance of science is
 of even higher importance to England rugby.

Busy man: Gary Neville has given up his Mail on Sunday newspaper column

Gary Neville giving up his Sunday 
newspaper column is the first sign - not before time - of him realising 
that his media commitments, mainly as the lead Sky football pundit plus 
his Manchester United ambassador position, do not sit comfortably with 
his role as an England coach in a World Cup year.

The Football League have prevaricated all season about taking action over manager Billy Davies’s agent Jim Price effectively running Nottingham Forest having not passed the owners’ and directors’ test.

So how long will it take them to rule on Cagliari owner Massimo Cellino’s controversial 75 per cent takeover at Leeds?

This is especially when his advisors in England, Italy and the United States are strongly contesting that Cellino’s suspended sentences for fraud in 1996 and 2001 were politically motivated, as was his arrest a year ago on suspicion of attempted embezzlement concerning the building of Cagliari’s new football stadium.

Rule: The Football League are yet to act on Massimo Cellino's controversial 75 per cent takeover at Leeds
