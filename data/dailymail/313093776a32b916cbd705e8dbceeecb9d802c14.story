A challenger to a mayor accused of stealing votes was smeared as a racist and likened to Oswald Mosely, a court heard today.

John Biggs was branded a 'John Bigot'  when he stood up to Lutfur Rahman, Britain’s first elected Muslim mayor, it was said.

The claims were made at the rare electoral fraud trial at which Rahman is alleged to have cheated an election to win power.

His rival Mr Biggs, the Labour Party’s candidate who narrowly lost the ‘rigged’ poll to Rahman, claimed there was a cynical campaign to cost him votes by falsely portraying him as a racist to the Muslim community of East London’s Tower Hamlets.

Election case: Supporters of Lutfur Rahman, who runs Tower Hamlets Council (pictured campaigning last April), allegedly branded Labour rival John Biggs a racist in a bid to smear him  

Mr Biggs was dubbed ‘John Bigot’ by Rahman’s cronies who also compared him to 1930s fascist leader Mosely and warned voters in the devout area he planned to open ‘sex clubs’, the High Court was told. 

Rahman is accused of presiding over a ‘den of iniquity’ and masterminding a campaign of corruption, intimidation and fraud to steal the May 2014 mayoral election - and of smearing anyone who challenged him as ‘racist or Islamaphobic’.

Mr Biggs told the court that Rahman’s election agent Alibor Choudhury had proclaimed in a February 2014 town hall debate: ‘Oswald Mosley has his Blackshirts, John Biggs has his black cardigans.’

Mr Biggs added: 'He gestured towards me as he made [the remark about Mosely]' and said nothing he or his party had done was '‎comparable to the actions of Oswald Mosely‎', adding the comment was 'deliberately provocatively divisive and designed as part of a cumulative campaign to label me as a racist.' 

The Blackshirts infamously fought police and anti-fascists in the East End borough during the ‘Battle of Cable Street’ in 1936.

Mr Biggs – who was defeated by 3,252 votes on a turnout of 84,234 - said: ‘In summary, I have been the target of a protracted campaign to present me falsely as a racist, and this has influence public opinion in a way which has in my view influences the election result.’

The court was told that another of Rahman’s acolytes, Councillor Gulam Robbani, posted a comment on a social network which claimed: 'John Biggs is bad news for Tower Hamlets. His councillors are already planning sex clubs in our borough and planning to put up Council Tax.’

Rahman’s party, Tower Hamlets First, had also issued a ‘dishonest’ press release accusing Labour members of planning a ‘fun day’ to coincide with a march by the far-right English Defence League, said Mr Biggs. ‘I believe that these statements were deliberately made, in the knowledge that they were false, in order to polarise opinion and to attempt to influence the election result.

‘The intention of these unfounded attacks was to divert voters from supporting me, either by not voting at all or by supporting another candidate.’

Opposition: Four residents, Andrew Erlam, left, Debbie Simone, Azmal Hussein, right, and Angela Moffat, plan to call 100 witnesses to prove the election was rigged

Historic: The High Court is hearing the rare electoral trial, which could result in a new election, mayor Rahman being suspended or banned from office or completely exhonerated

The electoral fraud trial is being heard by the Electoral Commissioner Richard Mawrey QC, who has the power to strip Rahman’s of his mayoralty and bar him from public office.

The case, under the Representation of the People Act 1983, has been brought not by the police, but by four local residents ‘fed up’ with Rahman’s corrupt practices. Petitioners Andrew Erlam, Debbie Simone, Azmal Hussein and Angela Moffat – who face huge legal fees if they lose – accuse Rahman and Choudhury of ‘corruption and illegal practices’.

They say local voters were ‘systematically’ robbed of a fair poll when Rahman was re-elected mayor.

Postal votes were stolen, ballot papers forged, elderly voters manipulated and an army of ‘ghost voters’ registered on the electoral roll, it was said.

Mobs of Rahman supporters allegedly intimidated voters at polling stations and told them it was a ‘sin’ against Islam to vote for anyone else, leaving one young man in tears.

Women in polling booths had their ballot papers filled in for them by men, with one presiding officer describing a ‘constant battle’ to prevent fraud unfolding under his nose, the court heard.

Seat of power: Mayor Rahman has started his second term in charge of Tower Hamlets Council in east London, which has a £1billion budget

As mayor, Bangladesh-born Rahman – who won power in 2010 and 2014 – abused his position to funnel hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money to dodgy groups run by his cronies, the campaigners claim.

Some of the petitioners’ 100 witnesses have been ‘threatened’ and are too scared to give evidence, said their barrister Francis Hoar who opened the case by claiming 49-year-old Rahman’s supporters ‘didn’t give a damn about the law’.

Controversial former lawyer Rahman – who flew the Palestinian flag over the town hall and has a £42,000-a-year chauffeur – was in court today, having been absent on the opening day.

Wearing a purple tie and navy blue suit, he sat facing the electoral judge as Mr Biggs gave evidence from the witness stand.

Rahman denies any wrongdoing. His QC, Duncan Penny, said there was ‘little if any’ evidence against him and described the claims as ‘invention’, ‘exaggeration’ and ‘in some cases downright deliberately false allegations.’

The case continues.
