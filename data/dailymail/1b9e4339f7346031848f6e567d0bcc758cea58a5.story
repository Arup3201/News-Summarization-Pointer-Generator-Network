The desperate battle to save a brutally beaten boy's life was recounted in graphic testimony today by doctors who tried in vain to revive him in a Michigan hospital.

Brandon Hayes, 25, stands accused of mercilessly beating Dominick Calhoun over a period of four days, before leaving the 4-year-old to die on the floor of his bedroom.

Hayes has been charged with torture, murder and child abuse in the boy's death.

A life cut short: Police say Dominick Calhoun, 4, died after several days of beatings at the hands of his mother's boyfriend, Brandon Hayes

Police have said that Hayes flew into a 
rage after Dominick wet himself while sitting on the couch in his 
mother's apartment in April 2010.

The Detroit Free Press reported that several medical professionals were brought in yesterday to testify about the day Dominick was brought in.

Cecilia Gingell, a nurse practitioner at Hurley Medical Center said that a doctor opened up the boy's skull to relieve pressure caused by his swelling brain, but it wasn't enough to save him.

She said: '[His brain] spilled outside. We could not help.'

The doctor who performed that operation, Dr Jawad Shah, also testified Monday at Hayes' murder trial, saying there was 'no hope' that the boy would pull through.

Suspect: Hayes, 25, has been charged in young Dominick's beating death, which is believed to have stemmed from the four-year-old wetting his pants

Fighting back tears, Dr Shah described the boy’s injuries as 'horrendous.'

Another doctor who examined the boy that day described his death as ‘the worst case I’ve seen.'

Dr Gregory Dale Casey said: 'I don't think he had even an inch [on his body] that was not bruised, including the soles of his feet.'

Dr Casey added: ‘I can't count how many old and new bruises we found. It was from his scalp to the soles of his feet.'

Cops claim Hayes beat Dominick over a four-day period the weekend, slamming the boy into a wall several times, punching him in the genitals and burning his hand.

History of abuse: Dominick's mother, Corrine Baker, who pleaded guilty in August to second-degree murder for not protecting her son against Hayes' alleged abuse, is expected to testify against her former boyfriend

Family members were at the boy’s bedside as doctors shut down life support on April 12, 2010.

Also testifying yesterday was the boy’s grandfather, Rick Calhoun, who said he found a badly-bruised Dominick moaning on the floor of his bedroom and called police.

The boy's mother, Corrine Baker, pleaded guilty in August to second-degree murder charges for not protecting her son against Hayes' alleged abuse. 

She is expected to testify against her former boyfriend.

Hayes’ lawyer James Piazza has argued that his client is plagued by hallucinations, but a psychiatric evaluation found that he was competent to stand trial.
