England looked flat just after tea at Old Trafford, Stuart Broad was in hospital and the prospect of Hurricane Bertha blowing away the last two days of this fourth Test loomed large. Then Hurricane Moeen rocked India’s foundations.

What an extraordinary transformation in a last session which saw nine wickets crash and England claim a sensational innings-and-54-run victory to guarantee at least a share of this Investec series.

And what a spineless, pathetic display from an India side who have imploded since their historic victory at Lord’s under the leadership of a captain in MS Dhoni who just did not look interested.

Done and dusted: Chris Jordan finished off India at Old Trafford as the hosts crushed the visitors on day three

How crucial, with biblical rain apparently heading to Manchester, was the intervention of the remarkable Moeen Ali and the brilliant Jimmy Anderson in a thrilling session which gave England victory in effectively two-and-a-half days.

The farcical loss of at least two hours of play on Friday because of the limitations of the Lancashire drainage had increased the need for England to press for victory with such a bad forecast for the final two days.

Yet it seemed that they would face frustration, not least when Broad was struck such a nasty blow through his helmet on to his nose that not only ruled him out of bowling yesterday but may force him to miss the Oval Test next week.

England initially looked lacklustre in the field, Anderson appeared out of sorts and Broad was being badly missed as India moved to 33 at tea for the loss of only Murali Vijay, who provided Chris Woakes with a much-needed wicket.

All India had to do was bat their way through a single session against a depleted England attack and then hope that Mother Nature could come to their rescue and allow them to head south for the final Test with all to play for.

Yet they could not even do that, crashing to a humiliating defeat which saw four wickets fall for eight runs before all remaining nine were demolished for a further 128 runs to leave India in tatters.

India’s inadequacy should take nothing away from the brilliance of an England side who have spectacularly found their feet under Alastair Cook after hitting rock bottom with their own last-day capitulation in the second Test.

At the centre of the drama was again the distinctive figure of Moeen who, in the space of two Tests, has gone from a spinner whom England did not really trust to a match-winner of almost Graeme Swann-like proportions.

Delighted: Jordan jumps for joy as he wraps up the victory on day three at Old Trafford on Saturday

It was at Old Trafford where Moeen once took 12 wickets in a match for Worcestershire and now he mesmerised an India side supposedly proficient against spin for the second successive Test after excelling in Southampton.

Moeen had taken six wickets in the second innings in that comprehensive victory at the Ageas Bowl and now he added four more to thrill the Manchester crowd and take his tally to an extraordinary 19 in four matches in this series.

When you consider that only Ray Illingworth, with 20 victims in 1967, has taken more wickets with spin in a home series against India for England then you can appreciate the scale of this Test novice’s achievement.

India simply had no answer to Moeen, who has bowled his off-spin significantly quicker since Lord’s, and the imperious Anderson, who claimed supposed danger man Virat Kohli for the fourth time for just seven runs.

Reasons to be cheerful: Alastair Cook and James Anderson leave the pitch after winning the Test match

That was a second wicket for Anderson, cleared by judge Gordon Lewis before the match over his spat with Ravindra Jadeja and now just eight wickets away from overtaking Sir Ian Botham and becoming England’s leading Test wicket-taker. The stage is set for him to claim the record at The Oval.

Anderson left the field for 35 minutes feeling unwell after claiming Kohli, a concern for England with the fifth Test coming on Friday, but he was back by the time Chris Jordan wrapped up victory with the final two wickets in two balls.

Jordan had earlier been denied the wicket of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, well caught by Ian Bell, when he overstepped but it barely held up England, who had the game wrapped up by 6.20pm, to the joy of a near capacity Old Trafford crowd.

Moeen even had a hand in the one wicket that did not fall to a bowler, turning and throwing brilliantly to run out Kumar and make up for Jordan’s mistake in denying himself a wicket that would have been invaluable to him.

England had earlier batted with admirable tempo to extend their overnight lead to 215, Joe Root and Jos Buttler leading the way before Broad was struck an ugly blow the ball after pulling Varun Aaron for successive sixes.

Broad had cut a disconsolate figure as he walked round the Old Trafford outfield having had his nose stitched up to depart for hospital and checks for both a break and possible concussion.

Yet England’s heroics and his award as man of the match would have cheered him, not least the way England found a way to win so spectacularly without him and with Jordan and Woakes still failing to match the bowling of the big two.

Broad’s fitness for The Oval must be in doubt but Liam Plunkett, who faces a fitness test tomorrow, is confident of being fit after a foot injury while the return of Steven Finn to the squad for this match showed he is on the way back. 

Suddenly England are looking a formidable young side and can look forward to The Oval with much excitement.
