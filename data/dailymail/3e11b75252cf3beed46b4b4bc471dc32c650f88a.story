A man being held under police guard in hospital after a woman was stabbed to death in front of her children is a former police officer, it emerged today.

Jonathan Sutton, 39, who has been having surgery on knife wounds sustained during the incident in which his partner, Emma Mansell died, served with the West Yorkshire Police a decade ago.

Mother of three Miss Mansell, 37, was pronounced dead in hospital shortly after police were called to her house in Huddersfield over reports of a domestic incident.

Neighbours rushed to help after an injured boy was seen running from the house, covered in blood, crying 'Someone needs to help my mummy and baby and brother' on Sunday night.

Jonathan Sutton, 39, is under police guard in hospital after his partner Emma Mansell, 37, was stabbed to death - it emerged today that he is a former officer with West Yorkshire Police

Injury: Police rushed Miss Mansell from her home to hospital but she was pronounced dead a short while later

Miss Mansell, who worked at a special school in Huddersfield for a decade, had two sons, Freddie, 11, and Oscar, nine, with her estranged husband, Stuart Siswick.  She also had a six-month-old daughter, Elise, with Mr Sutton, while her partner has a six-year-old son.

All of the children were treated for injuries after the incident, with the two older boys needing surgery for their wounds.

Neighbours said Freddie and Oscar ran screaming from the house, covered in blood, with wounds to their hands, arms, and bodies.  One said Freddie was shaking, while his younger brother cried: 'I've been stabbed, help me.  Someone needs to save my mummy, brothers and baby sister.'

A neighbour who went to help the older boy said: 'He just kept saying, ‘I think he has killed my mum and my baby sister’.

'I said who has done this and he told me. He was very, very distressed.

'I just did what I could to help. I laid him down because he was bleeding heavily.  I tried to keep him calm'.

The children are now believed to have been released from hospital, into the care of Miss Mansell's former husband, Mr Siswick.

Tragedy: Miss Mansell, a mother of three, worked at a special school in Huddersfield for ten years

Scene: Officers launched a murder probe after they were called to the house in Huddersfield on Sunday

Detectives are waiting to question Mr Sutton, who needed surgery for knife wounds to the throat and neck.

He
 has not been arrested due to his medical condition but police say he 
has been 'detained' in hospital and that they are not looking for anyone
 else in connection with the incident.

He served with West Yorkshire Police from May 2003 until he resigned in November 2004.

Miss Mansell, who reverted to her maiden name after splitting from Mr Siswick, worked at Longley special school in Huddersfield.

Head teacher Anne Lawton said: 'Emma worked here for 10 years as a teaching assistant.  She was a popular and well respected member of the school community.

'She will be sorely missed by everybody. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.'

Neighbours in the residential 
street said that Miss Mansell had separated from her husband around 18 months 
ago before beginning a new relationship with Mr Sutton, whom they 
described as a labourer she had met in a local pub.

Probe: A forensics officer photographs the garden of the house where Miss Mansell was found badly injured

Since the fatal incident on Sunday night, forensics officers have been combing the property for evidence

Forensic markers: Officers will speak to Mr Sutton when he is sufficiently recovered from his knife injuries

Neighbours said they found Miss Mansell's two sons bloodied and injured on the street on Sunday night

Marcel Adams, one of Miss Mansell's childhood friends, said: 'I can't believe this has happened to Emma.

'She
 was always so lovely and kind. She's had a lot of things happen to her 
in her life. She lost a child to meningitis years ago and she has always
 just tried to get on with things.'

She added: 'Apparently
 Emma was madly in love with her partner but I never knew him. I saw her
 a few months ago and she was crying so I asked what was wrong. She 
didn't want to tell me but I told her she knew where I was if she wanted
 to talk.'

Friends, neighbours, relatives and colleagues laid flowers on the wall of the house including one from her Miss Mansell's nieces.

Horror: Neighbours said they had seen a baby being brought out of the house, its blanket covered in blood

Investigation: Neighbours said Miss Mansell had lost her first child, Charlie, to meningitis at the age of two

One message read: 'Aunty Emma, Sleep tight, we love you so much, your now with Charlie watching over us. I can never say bye just see you because I will see you again. Love you.'

Charlie was Miss Mansell's first child, who died at the age of two in 2001 from meningitis.

June Fuery, 52, choked back tears and was shaking as she laid flowers at Emma’s home.

She said: 'I worked with Emma behind the bar at Oakes Club. I knew her before that as I knew her mum and dad.

'We had some right laughs at the club. She was a lovely lady, bubbly and outgoing. She loved her children, and was heartbroken when Charlie died from meningitis.'

She added: 'My neighbour’s friend went out into the street and saw her eldest Freddie covered in blood.

'She thought he had fallen off his bike then he told what had happened.'
