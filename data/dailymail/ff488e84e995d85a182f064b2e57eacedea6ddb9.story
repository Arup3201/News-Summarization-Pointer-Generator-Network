England were given a thunderous send-off by the Kaiser Chiefs at their charity ball last night as they prepare to head out to Portugal at lunchtime.

The Lions and Roses dinner, which was held at the Grove Hotel in Hertfordshire, marked the starting point for the country’s World Cup preparations.

Roy Hodgson’s 23 man squad, plus John Stones and Jon Flanagan, will convene at the prestigious Vale do Lobo resort today to begin their preparations for Brazil.

It is there
 that England’s players will sometimes train in hats and gloves to help 
acclimatise to the conditions expected in Manaus when they play Italy at
 the tournament.

England’s
 performance team have packed the winter gear to help the players’ 
bodies adjust to the heat and humidity which they will encounter next 
month.

Hodgson
 is taking his entire back room staff out to Portugal, including their 
newly-appointed performance specialist Dave Reddin.

The
 summer season is just beginning in Portugal and the team will also 
encounter daily temperatures of around 26 degrees celsius when they 
arrive in Miami.

Hodgson’s
 squad will spend this week together before retiring to St George’s Park
 on May 26 to prepare for a friendly with Peru at Wembley four days 
later.

After
 the clash with Peru, they head out to Miami on June 1 to play 
friendlies against Ecuador (Jun 4) and Honduras (Jun 7). The squad fly 
to their Rio base camp the following day.

Hodgson,
 who confirmed Frank Lampard as his vice-captain yesterday, said: ‘All 
of us are going to Brazil with one burning ambition.

‘We’ve worked hard to get there and want to come home with people saying ‘well done’.

‘But
 there’s only one way for that to happen, by preparing properly, 
competing in the best shape and get our minds right. That doesn’t mean 
locking people up in their rooms or making them go through four-hour 
meetings.

‘They’re human beings and we want them to perform as well as they can perform.

‘We
 have the hope, dream and ambition. But to do well, we have to play 
well, play better than the opponents, for all the players to live up to 
their reputations.

‘They
 deserve those big reputations. It’s up to them to live up to them and 
up to us as a coaching team to ensure they’re capable of doing that.’

Hodgson
 still has reservations over a number of players in the travelling party
 as they continue to recover from various injuries.

Wayne
 Rooney went to Vale do Lobo a week in advance of his team-mates to 
begin his preparations after missing Manchester United’s last three 
fixtures.

Team-mate
 Danny Welbeck, who is fit, has also been training daily in Dubai along 
with his brothers, some friends and a personal trainer.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who was left out of Arsenal’s FA Cup final squad on Saturday, has joined the England party.

Arsenal chief Arsene Wenger said: ‘He was desperate to play against Hull.

‘Pain-wise he could have played, but I judged him to be short physically.

‘We wanted to play players who were completely fit. Physically, he was a bit short.

‘Certainly
 he could have played 20/30 minutes, but you can’t programme it like 
that. We left him out, but he’s on the way up and he needs more fitness 
work now. He will go to Portugal with (Jack) Wilshere.’

Wilshere came on as a substitute for Arsenal in their thrilling 3-2 victory over Hull at Wembley in Saturday’s final.

Phil Jones, who aggravated his shoulder playing for Manchester United against Hull on May 6, remains in the ‘at risk’ category.

Adam Lallana, who was nursing a minor groin injury in Southampton’s final few Premier League games, has no long-term issues.

Hodgson
 intends the week in Portugal to be a low-key start to the country’s 
preparations, but it has not gone unnoticed that other teams are already
 underway.

Germany drew with Poland in midweek and Louis van Gaal’s Holland side drew 1-1 with Ecuador in a World Cup warm-up on Saturday.

England have a slower start, but will ramp up preparations when they play Peru at Wembley in front of a full house on May 30.
