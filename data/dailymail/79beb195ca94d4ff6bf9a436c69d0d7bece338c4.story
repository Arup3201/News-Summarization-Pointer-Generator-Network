A Second World War veteran who risked his life to transport vital supplies to the Soviet Union has spoken of his anger at being denied a bravery medal by the British government.

Bob Cowan, 93, has been offered a medal by Russia for his role in the 1941-1945 Arctic Convoys, but British rules on foreign military honours bar him from accepting it.

The Russian embassy recently offered the Ushakov medal for valour to all survivors of the perilous missions to deliver food and munitions to allies on the Eastern Front, on which 3,000 sailors died.

'It's a farce': Bob Cowan, 93, has been told British rules ban him from accepting an award from Russia in recognition of his service on the Second world War Arctic convoys

They have already given the honour to veterans from Australia, Canada and America.

But Bob, who braved German torpedo attacks on two convoys in May and October 1942, has been told that Foreign Office red tape prevents him and other veterans from claiming the medal.

Under the rules, former British soldiers are not allowed to accept military medals from foreign governments - unless it awards service performed in the past five years or there is no equivalent medal in Britain.

But veterans' groups say that the Ushakov medal is a bravery award, and can therefore be awarded in addition to campaign medals that recognise service.

Grandad-of-four Bob, who lives in Chorlton, Manchester, with wife Joyce, 87, said: 'It's a farce. It seems like they have been trying to sort out [what recognition we should get] for years.

'I would like to receive the Russian medal. The Russian embassy has the silver medal in its possession so it's just waiting for our government to give it the go-ahead.'

Perilous: 3,000 sailors died on the Arctic convoys

Hellish: Sailors braved freezing conditions to deliver essential food and munitions to the Soviet Union

The British Government 
has repeatedly denied the Arctic convoy survivors a campaign medal of 
their own, insisting the Atlantic Star medal is sufficient.

Veterans say the Atlantic Star is 
inadequate, as it was created in recognition of a separate Naval 
campaign and extended to include those who served on the convoys.

The fight to overturn the government ruling has now been taken up by the Labour MP for Gorton Gerald Kaufman.

And Bob's friends at community group Chorlton Good Neighbours, plan to conduct a ceremony in his honour - regardless of what the Government decides.

Bernard Leach, from the group, said: 'Bob is 93 and in poor health and I don't see why he should not be honoured in this way. It seems mean-spirited of the British government.'

A spokesman for the foreign office said: 'We very much appreciate the Russian government's wish to recognise the brave and valuable service given by veterans of the Arctic Convoys.

The Arctic covoys delivered essential supplies to the Soviet Union during the darkest part of the Second World War.

With naval escorts, around 1400 merchant vessels sailed from Britain, Iceland and North America to the Soviet ports of Archangel and Murmansk.

The convoys carried food, munitions, weapons and vehicles donated under the Allies' lend-lease agreement. These supplies were vital to Russian troops on the Eastern Front, particularly those resisting the siege of Leningrad.

85 merchant vessels and 16 Royal Navy warships were lost over the course of the campaign.

'However, the Rules on the acceptance of foreign awards clearly state that in order for permission to be given for an award to be accepted, there has to have been specific service to the country concerned and that that service should have taken place within the previous five years.

'Additionally, permission cannot be granted if they have received, or are expected to receive, a UK award for the same services. All British Veterans of the Convoys were eligible for the WW2 'Atlantic Star'. Additionally, a lapel badge (the "Arctic Emblem") was introduced in 2006 and some 10,000 have been issued.

'We look at each request for permission to confer a foreign or Commonwealth state award upon a British citizen on an individual case by case basis. We can never comment on individual cases, but, in general terms, the Russian government would need to provide evidence of direct support for Russia in the last five years for any British citizen to be awarded the Ushakov Medal.'
