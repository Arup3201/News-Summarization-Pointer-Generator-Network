On El Clasico weekend, all sorts of superlatives are used to describe the long-running rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid, and rightly so.

But 24 hours later, 1500 miles east in Athens, arguably Europe's fiercest derby will be taking place. Panathinaikos vs Olympiacos is so intense they call it the 'Derby of the Eternal Adversaries' and the 'Mother of all Battles', and the pictures say it all.

Both are Greek Gods in their own footballing right, and for decades have battled it out at the top. On Sunday at 5.30pm, they meet again at Olympiacos' Piraeus home.

Sportsmail brings you all you need to know in bite size chunks.

So, why the rivalry?

The two sides have won 61 Greek titles between them, so naturally the competitive rivalry is extremely healthy.

'You’ve got Gate 13 who are the fanatics. They’re behind one of the goals like a hive of bees. The noise, the smoke bombs, the fireworks. It’s absolutely electric.’

Panathinaikos goalkeeper Luke Steele reflects his summer experience in the 'Mother of All Battles.'

But it runs so much deeper. Panathinaikos, formed in 1908 from the higher classes of Athens' make up, preceded Olympiacos by 17 years.

The 'newcomers' were from the more working class port of Pireaus, and although the boundaries are far blurrier in the 21st century, the battle to rule Athens often results in violence on the pitch, in the stands and around the capital.

As you can expect, both clubs have the biggest followings in the country, and clashes are the result of two of Greek football's biggest egos, year after year attempting to claim bragging rights.

How violent can it get?

Each picture tells its own story of crowd and player trouble down the years. The bizarre sight of all XI players racing off the pitch as quick as possible when the away side wins tells you just how hostile it is.

Just last season Panathinaikos manager Yannis Anastasiou fell to the ground after being hit with an object thrown from the crowd during the 3-0 win in Piraeus, and in 2012 the derby was abandoned after petrol bombs were thrown at the Olympic Stadium. Parts of the modern, 70,000 seater stadium, five years after holding a Champions League final, were on fire.

Flares are thrown around like confetti, firework explosions will make you jump out of your seat… Oh, and Dimitrios Mavrogenidis was hit by a water balloon to the face while representing Olympiacos in 2003.

But the rivalry isn't just centred on football, either. Both clubs have passionately-supported volleyball and basketball teams, and in March 2007 a 22-year-old Panathinaikos fan was stabbed to death in violent clashes between hooligans of the two clubs before a women's volleyball game. Organised crowd violence is a major issue in Greek sport, not just football.

Who wins the footballing battles on the pitch?

Olympiacos are 41-20 up on league titles and 26-18 ahead on Greek Cup wins. The Red and White also dominate the head-to-head meetings, winning 76 to Panathinaikos' 47.

In recent years the trend is similar, with Panathinaikos winning just two of the last 15 meetings.

And there isn't any wonder why footballing passions are so high in Athens; the honours board for the Greek Superleague has a particular capital feel to it. Incredibly, all but five of the last 92 champions have been from Athens.

What can we expect from this derby?

Olympiacos, winners of the last four titles, are third in the division after four wins from six, trailing the leaders from Thessaloniki PAOK by three points. They're coming off the back of a fine 1-0 win over Juventus in the Champions League, and they're unbeaten at home in the league since that defeat to Panathinaikos in March.

The Shamrock are sixth, three points behind their rival, and got a hard-fought 1-1 draw at PSV in the Europa League in the week. They have former Manchester United goalkeeper Luke Steele between the sticks, the 30-year-old choosing to continue his career in Greece rather than move to another Championship club in the summer.

You'll also remember former Fulham man Milan Petric, Panathinaikos' front man along with Swede Marcus Berg. Another former Fulham star, Patjim Kasami, scored the winner against Juventus for Olympiacos, with Eric Abidal and Ibrahim Afellay also on their books.
