Mauricio Pochettino is well known for encouraging a possession-based style of play, but not many Tottenham fans would've predicted his side would score after a 48-pass move during his first Premier League game at White Hart Lane.

Unfortunately for former Spurs boss and current QPR manager Harry Redknapp, that's exactly what happened when midfielder Nacer Chadli finished off a fine passage of play with a powerful header past Rob Green.

The move began with defender Jan Vertonghen picking up the ball inside his own half and finding Chadli out on the right by the halfway line.

Heads up: Tottenham midfielder Nacer Chadli finishes off his side's 48-pass move to make it 3-0

Not enough: QPR keeper Rob Green can't stop the Belgian's header finding the back of the net

Possession football: Spurs played a total of 48 passes before Chadli finished with a well-taken header

The Belgium international chose to go back to Younes Kaboul and, after a long period of keep ball in front of keeper Hugo Lloris, Tottenham eventually worked it down their left side.

Etienne Capoue, Nabil Bentaleb, Danny Rose, Emmanuel Adebayor and Christian Eriksen were all involved in the move before the ball found Erik Lamela in the centre of the pitch.

The Argentine skipped past the challenges of Richard Dunne and Maurcio Isla before playing an inch-perfect cross into the area for the unmarked Chadli to finish.

It was the 25-year-old's second goal of the game and helped Pochettino's side record a convincing 4-0 win over new-boys QPR, with Eric Dier and Emmanuel Adebayor also on target.

Every member of the Spurs XI completed a pass in the build-up to Nacer Chadli's second strike.
