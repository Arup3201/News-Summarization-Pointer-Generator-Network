Zlatan Ibrahimovic collected the Sweden Player of the Year award for an eighth consecutive time before making a heart-felt speech about his brother Sakpo's untimely death.

The Paris Saint-Germain striker has won the so-called Guldbollen (Golden Ball), decided by tabloid Aftonbladet and the Swedish Football Association, for nine out of the last 10 years.

Ibrahimovic attended the gala ceremony where he spoke of Sapko, who passed away in April after a long illness which his brother hinted was 'similar' to cancer.

The event already carried a sombre tone with the nation in mourning following the deaths of Klas Ingesson, a former midfielder who was part of the squad that finished third at the 1994 World Cup but sadly lost his battle with cancer, and former IF Brommapojkarna defender Pontus Segerström who suffered a brain tumour.

Upon taking the stage, Ibrahimovic, 33, said: 'All these awards that I've received, it means that I've achieved something; and that I'm good at what I'm doing but it's overshadowed by what happened to Klas Ingesson and Pontus Segerstrom.

'I had a brother who passed away a couple of months ago in a similar disease. There's a life besides football that is much more important than this. So... may they rest in peace.' 

The charismatic former Barcelona, Juventus and Milan striker struggled to contain his emotions before leaving the stage to a standing ovation from the guests.
