Manchester United’s £59.7million signing Angel di Maria is set to break the British transfer record.

It’s a switch far removed from the one which took Alf Common south from Sunderland to Middlesbrough in 1905, for the then princely sum of £1,000.

Common was British football’s first grand star and he was the country’s most expensive player for six years.

Transfer: Angel di Maria's transfer from Real Madrid to Manchester United will become a new record 

It took 23 years for the first player to cost £10,000 when David Jack – a scorer in the first FA Cup final at Wembley – moved from Bolton to Arsenal.

The magic £100,000 barrier wasn’t broken until the early 1960s, when Denis Law returned to England from Italy, with United paying £115,000 for the striker.

Trevor Francis became football’s first million pound player in 1979 as he joined Nottingham Forest from Birmingham City. However, despite scoring a European Cup final winner he never quite settled at the City Ground and was later shipped off to Manchester City for another hefty fee.

Midfielders such as Bryan Robson and Roy Keane have been the subjects of the record transfer fee but it is generally strikers for whom the big bucks are paid.

But that was blown out of the water in 1996 when Alan Shearer joined his boyhood club Newcastle United from Blackburn Rovers for a staggering £15m.

Just five years later, this record was nearly doubled as Argentina midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron signed for Manchester United from Lazio. He was one of the stars of the world game but, after a lively start at Old Trafford, flopped spectacularly.

Record: When Chelsea paid £50m for Fernando Torres he beat the old record by more than £10m

In 2002, Sir Alex Ferguson broke the record once more at United and this signing was a big shock in terms of positioning as centre half Rio Ferdinand was bought from Leeds United for just over £29million.

Andriy Shevchenko became British football’s first £30m signing in 2006 but possibly the most surprising fee paid for any player was the £35m forked out by Liverpool for Andy Carroll in 2011. His record at Anfield never came close to justifying the fee.

It may be a blessing for Carroll that he held the record for a matter of hours as later on that same January day, Fernando Torres joined Chelsea for £50m. It has become a symbol of the folly of spending big towards the end of a transfer window.

United must be hoping Di Maria ends up more like a Cole or a Shearer than a Carroll or a Torres.
