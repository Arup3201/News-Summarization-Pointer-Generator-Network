Detectives are believed to be investigating the death of a prominent British hotelier found dead inside a burnt out Range Rover on the tropical island of St Lucia.

A charred body, identified locally as Oliver ‘Ollie’ Gobat, 38, was discovered hours after his family - who run a £405-a-night five star boutique hotel - reported him missing.

Sources have suggested the victim had 
been shot twice in the head before being doused with petrol and set 
alight - although island police would not confirm this.

Police and the Foreign Office would not confirm the victim's name - but double Olympic decathlon gold medallist Daley Thompson paid a personal tribute to the man on Twitter.

The sportsman has carried out fitness workshops at the family’s luxurious Cap Maison hotel on the island.

He wrote: 'My love&thoughts go out to friends&family of Ollie Gobat. he was a gem& his family must have been so proud of him. RIP my friend. X’

Unconfirmed reports from St Lucia suggest Mr Gobat’s family lodged a ‘missing person’ report with police after he failed to return home on Friday night.

The vehicle he owns matches the description of the Range Rover which was discovered with the body inside around 9pm last Friday.

The body of the prominent island businessman, in his late thirties, was said to have been ‘burnt beyond recognition’ and was found in the front passenger seat.

The FCO is working with island authorities to help identify the body after news emerged of the death.

An FCO spokesperson said: 'We are aware of reports and are looking into them urgently.'

A spokesman for St Lucia police said: 'We can’t disclose any information at the moment, we are meeting with the family soon.'

Cap
 Maison, a five-star boutique hotel set in the lush tropical grounds of a
 former sugar plantation on the northern tip of the island, offers 
luxury suites.

Athlete Daley Thompson who knew the Gobat family today tweeted: 'My love&thoughts go out to friends&family of Ollie Gobat. he was a gem& his family must have been so proud of him. RIP my friend. X

Guests, that have included Amy Winehouse and Kelly Brook, stay in colonial-style villas and every luxury is on tap, including valets, private chefs, a walk-in wine cellar and spa.

The creators of the hotel were the Gobat family, Theo and Helen and their three sons Rufus, Adam and Oliver.

The dead man’s parents, who live in Esher, Surrey, are understood to have flown out to St Lucia .

Theo Gobat, 74, was born in Chester  and trained as an accountant and moved to St Lucia in 1974 as finance director of a hotel and travel company which then went bankrupt.

He and another director successfully took over the company’s hotels and eventually created the small, upmarket Cap Maison.

Oliver was born in St Lucia but had dual 
nationality. He represented Surrey juniors at cricket and attended Leeds
 University, before moving to Australia to help launch a health and 
fitness club in Adelaide, Australia.

Mr Garner's death comes three after Roger Pratt, 62, was murdered and his wife Margaret, 60, injured when robbers attacked their yacht as it lay moored off the Caribbean island of St Lucia.

The couple, from Warwickshire, had been on a dream voyage around the world on their £200,000 yacht, when they were ambushed at the port of Vieux Fort, at night.

Four men have been charged with Mr Pratt's murder.
