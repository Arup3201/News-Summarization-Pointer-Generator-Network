Danny Alexander wants to target pension pots

The Liberal Democrats will today promise to increase NHS spending by targeting the pension pots of the middle classes.

Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said the party would spend £1billion a year more on the Health Service than David Cameron pledged earlier this week.

The spending increase will be paid for by measures including limiting tax relief on pension pots for what the Lib Dems called ‘high earners’.

But experts said last night that the raid would hit thousands hoping to retire on annual pensions of £30,000.

The pledge – which could affect many public sector workers – will be announced at the Lib Dem conference, which gets under way in Glasgow today.

It comes as a survey of party members found that two thirds believe fewer than 40 Lib Dem MPs would be elected at next May’s general election – down from 57 at the last election.

Earlier this week, David Cameron said the Conservatives would ring-fence the Health Service budget.

But Mr Alexander will announce that the Lib Dem manifesto will promise to spend £1billion a year more than this. This would be funded from measures to reduce the lifetime allowance for tax relief on pension savings from £1.25million to £1million.

In addition, the Lib Dems want to adjust dividend tax for additional rate taxpayers, and end the Tory policy of ‘shares for rights’ under which workers sacrifice basic employment rights in exchange for shares in the company for which they work.

Mr Alexander said: ‘A comprehensive Health Service paid for by the taxpayer and delivered free at the point of need was a Liberal idea and is a central part of our vision of a stronger economy and a fairer society.

‘We will raise this extra money from asking the better off to contribute a little more in tax. This Liberal Democrat commitment is fully and fairly funded.’

But former Treasury pensions adviser Dr Ros Altmann said the raid on pension pots would affect those expecting annual post-retirement incomes of around £30,000. ‘These are not wealthy people – £30,000 a year is hardly a king’s ransom,’ she said. ‘This would make many people very upset.

‘A lot of people, particularly in the public sector, on good final salary schemes could be caught in the tax net. You should be free to make your money grow as much as possible.’

Yesterday a YouGov poll put the Lib Dems on only 6 per cent of the vote, equalling its lowest level since the polling organisation was formed in 2000.

The poll for The Sun and The Times – carried out after the Prime Minister’s promises of tax cuts at the Tory conference – gave his party a lead of one percentage point over Labour.

The Conservatives were on 35 per cent, Labour on 34 per cent and Ukip on 14 per cent.

Meanwhile, a poll of 735 Lib Dem party members for Liberal Democrat Voice, an activists’ website, found that 80 per cent continue to support the Coalition. But 67 per cent said they expected the party to slip below 40 MPs at the next election.

While 50 per cent said they were satisfied with Mr Clegg’s leadership, this is only just ahead of the 48 per cent who said they were ‘dissatisfied’.
