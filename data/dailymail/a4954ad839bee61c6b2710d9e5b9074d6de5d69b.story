Tweets hitting out at Mr Hockey's luxurious lifestyle on the North Shore following his comments

Twitter users poke a barrage of serious fun at Mr Hockey’s luxurious lifestyle which includes a five-bedroom harbourside family home in Hunters Hill, one of Sydney's wealthiest harbourside suburbs, believed to be worth more than $5 million, which they bought for $3.5 million in 2004.

‘#OtherThingsThePoorDontDo ‘go to St Aloysius High School, marry an investment banker and live in Hunters Hill where median price is $1.8m.'

‘#OtherThingsThePoorDontDo build $15,000 bookcases; decide they don't like them, rip out and rebuild for another $15,000.'

‘#OtherThingsThePoorDontDo buy $800 door knobs for rooms they don't use.’

‘#OtherThingsThePoorDontDo own five houses and a Queensland cattle farm.’

The fiery comments stem from Mr Hockey stating on ABC radio in Brisbane that 'the poorest people either don't have cars or actually don't drive very far in many cases'.

Meanwhile, Mr Hockey’s $10 million property portfolio also includes a 200 hectare cattle farm in Queensland and a beautiful six-bedroom coastal retreat with 180-degree views of the beach in Stanwell Park, an hour south of Sydney.

‘BREAKING NEWS: @JoeHockey announces that poor needn't worry about the cost of living as they don't live as long’.

Twitter followers have taken the idea and run with it suggesting that lower socio-economic people don’t vote Liberal and don’t’ ‘lose touch with society’.

‘Poor people don't let other poor people vote for Joe Hockey,’ another stated.

Another posted that the poor don’t ‘get knighthoods.’

Climate change also came up on the Twitter feed: 'OtherThingsThePoorDontDo - Think the world is cooling'.
