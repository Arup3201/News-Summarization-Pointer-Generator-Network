Gardening, golf and package holidays are behind soaring hospital admissions for skin cancer, researchers warn.

Rates have risen by around 40 per cent in just four years and almost 124,000 now need hospital treatment annually.

Experts are particularly concerned about the high number of older men diagnosed too late with malignant melanoma, the deadliest form of the disease.

These tumours commonly develop on their backs, appearing as moles, but many men may not notice until too late.

Men are particularly vulnerable as they may spend more time in the garden, doing DIY outside or washing the car with their shirts off, without sun cream, researchers said.

A Public Health England study shows hospital admissions for malignant melanoma increased from 11,157 to 14,475 between 2007 and 2011.

Over the same period, admissions for non-malignant melanoma, which is far more common but rarely fatal, soared from 76,528 to 109,333. This is an overall rise in admissions of 41 per cent in four years.

Lead researcher Professor Julia Verne said the rise was partly due to people not covering themselves up or using sun cream on package holidays, while playing golf or during time in the garden here.

‘Men are particularly vulnerable as they tend to take off their shirts and won’t bother putting on sun cream,’ she added.

‘We wonder whether the increase in older men [being admitted for melanoma] is a legacy of home exposure as well as the increase of overseas holidays … we also wonder whether they are less likely to wear sun cream … we are concerned about how quickly the rates are increasing in old men.

‘Males are more likely to get melanomas on their back and they are presenting very late. We need men to be examining their backs more.

‘We don’t know if it is because they are more vain or more stoical. We don’t want melanomas to be missed particularly if they can be treated.’ Professor Verne said non-malignant melanoma are not seen as important ‘as they don’t kill people but they do result in an enormous number of procedures for the NHS’.

The study also found the NHS is spending £95.5million treating skin cancer.

Sarah Williams, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Changes to where patients are treated may have added to the size of this increase in hospital treatment … but it’s worrying to see rising rates of a disease that could largely be prevented.’

She added that September sun in the UK can still be strong enough to burn, especially for sensitive skin.’

Separate figures from Public Health England show the highest number of malignant melanoma cases occur in men aged 65 to 69 – 778 in 2012.

Professor John Hawk, of the World Congress on Cancers of the Skin, said: ‘Older men were brought up in an era where [people] hadn’t been indoctrinated with the knowledge that sun is bad for you.

‘But older men … spend a lot of time outdoors … Most don’t like putting sunscreen on. They can’t be bothered.’
