Sarah Vine puts Poundland's make-up under the microscope

Poundland in Portobello Road is one of the last bastions of normality in Notting Hill, an area of London that has all been colonised by German bankers, their rail-thin wives and an assortment of international celebrity/ supermodel types.

Old Sloanes like me are practically an endangered species, along with the jovial drunks and the old Rasta entertaining passing tourists with his steel drums.

The shop, which occupies the site of the old Woolworth's, is a stone's throw from the likes of swanky stores such as Oka, Graham & Greene and Cath Kidston; in socio-economic terms, however, it's a million postcodes away.

And yet, as I peruse the beauty aisle, I find I'm not the only one with a Radio 4 accent. 'Excuse me,' says a middle-aged lady, her reading specs perched on the edge of her nose, reaching for a nail polish. 'Not at all,' I reply, and we do a funny little politeness dance with our baskets. On my left, a young Polish girl pops a couple of nail art pens in hers.

I am here because Poundland's profits are up, way up; and according to the company's chief executive, Jim McCarthy, it's due to an influx of middle-class customers like me stocking up on cheap cosmetics.

I'll be honest: I'm not a Poundland regular. I am, however, addicted to cheapie fashion store TK Maxx, so I'm no stranger to discount shopping.

But while I love a bargain dress, I'm more cautious when it comes to cosmetics. Quality, not price, drives my purchases.

First on my Poundland list is foundation. Not much choice (and nothing for darker skins). Since there are no testers, I choose the shade that looks closest to my skin tone, 'biscuit'. The brand is Chit Chat, not one I'm familiar with. I find a black mascara in the same vein.

A brand called Catwalk Collection yields three eyeshadows, a plum, a purple and a dark grey (good colours) as well as a neutral pinky nude lipstick.

The ingredients are listed on the back: Mica, talc, paraffin liquidum magnesium, ethylhexyl stearate, and many more. Not one for lovers of natural cosmetics. Still, at least they're being honest.

I spot a pot of Calvin Klein eyeshadow, so I bag that too. Lastly a powder compact ('Wet 'n' Wild Ultimate Touch'; nothing untoward, I can assure you), some make-up brushes, a Revlon nail polish and a make-up bag. No eyeliner, sadly. Total cost: £10.

The brushes are exactly what you would expect for £1: plastic, nasty and they shed little synthetic hairs everywhere. The foundation is a different story. It's good. It goes on evenly, covers shadows and surface blemishes with a luminous, lightweight finish. The smell is quite strong, but it's not unpleasant, just a little soapy.

The concealer is a tad waxy, but it blends well and does the job. The powder is yuk: chalky and horrid. The pot of CK eyeshadow turns out to be a disappointment, too: it looks like it's already been opened, and there is a distinct brush mark in it. I don't mind buying my china as seconds, but eyeshadow? Not so sure.

'Am I a convert? No. But I did pick up some great Hallowe'en tat for the children, a new dustpan and brush and something to unblock the bathroom drain with'

The mascara is just about okay. Watery, mainly, and definitely not 'lash building', as advertised. As for the eyeshadows, they go on well but last only a few hours. The nail polish, meanwhile, has clearly seen better days. The colours have separated and the consistency is too thick. Maybe a spell in the fridge will revive it. 

Am I a convert? No. But I did pick up some great Hallowe'en tat for the children, a new dustpan and brush and something to unblock the bathroom drain  with. Not a complete waste of  time, then.

It may have escaped your attention, but as well as apparently rejecting both bras and buttons (see Kim Kardashian, Miranda Kerr et al), the fashion crowd are also eschewing make-up.

Go nude (facially) like Rosie

Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Georgia May Jagger, even Holly Willoughby have been venturing out bare-faced. Well, sort of. The thing about the no make-up make-up look is that it actually requires more make-up than the make-up look, if you get my drift.

Unless you happen to be a dewy-skinned 21-year-old with supermodel genes, that flawless oh-look-I-just-fell-down-from-heaven angel vibe is hard to pull off without a little help.

It depends first and foremost on skin tone. This isn't just about finding a good foundation; its about keeping your skin in top condition. The Clarisonic (£125, from clarisonic.co.uk) may seem like just another fancy gadget, but it works wonders on all skin types. Use it regularly, and you will see real improvement, not just in terms of breakouts, but also skin tone and softness.

Next, you'll need a really good day cream. Make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury's Magic Cream has just launched in Selfridges and on her website, www.charlottetilbury.com.

This is the stuff she uses to prep the skins of fag- and jet-ravaged models, and it is truly fabulous. A tiny bit goes a very long way, which is just as well because it's £70 a pot. The best and most natural-looking foundations are the ones that gloss over imperfections without stifling the skin beneath.  Not easy.

I find that using a light foundation with concealer where necessary is always better than going all-over heavy.

Bourjois Radiance Reveal Healthy Mix foundation is really good in this respect (£7.99 from Boots); if you're feeling flush, try Giorgio Armani's sublime Maestro foundation (£38 from House  of Fraser).  All that's left then is to add a pop of healthy colour to cheeks and a couple of layers of mascara.

Bobbi Brown's Pot Rouge for Lips & Cheeks is ideal for this, but to be honest you can just dab a bit of your favourite lip colour on the apples of your cheeks.

Trust me, you and Rosie will be like two peas in a pod.
