These Chinese fisherman know a thing or two about how to catch their supper.

Using little more than a simple homespun raft and a gas lamp to light their way, these fascinating images capture the fisherman using cormorant birds to grab their catch of the day.

Photographer Bobby Joshi travelled to the Li River in Guilin, China and rose before dawn to capture the fishermen at work last October, which involves first controlling the birds before attaching a snare around their throats.

Cormorant fishing has been practiced in China and Japan since around 960 AD, although these days it is largely used as a tourist attraction

The traditional method allows the birds to swallow smaller fry as a treat, while the larger fish remain in their throats.

The fish is then spat out once the bird returns to the raft.

Bangalore-based Bobby says: 'It was an amazing experience to see the fishermen and cormorants working in tandem and harmony, showing off and catching fish for one another.

'The birds had a limited number of fish that they could catch but they didn't miss a single one.

'Travel gives me a chance to see the most beautiful places in the world and through my lens I am able to capture such great moments.'

The 40-year-old has travels all over the world to snap mother nature in all its glory, although according to his website, Bobby is careful to keep his subjects at arms length so as not to interfere with their natural beauty.
