The private clinic where Joan Rivers underwent a routine medical procedure has denied that 'a biopsy of the vocal cords' has ever been carried out there

The private clinic where Joan Rivers underwent a fatal routine medical procedure has denied that 'a biopsy of the vocal cords' has ever been carried out at the facility.

The announcement follows claims last night that the comedian's personal doctor performed a surprise biopsy on her vocal cords at the Manhattan clinic last month.

The 81-year-old comedian stopped breathing during the routine outpatient procedure and was on a life support machine until it was switched off last week.

Yorkville Endoscopy clinic also denied that Rivers was under general anesthesia and stated that the only levels of sedation used at the facility is 'light to moderate sedation' according to the New York Daily News.

Rivers was not mentioned by name in the statement with the clinic citing patient confidentiality rules. 

Yesterday the New York Daily News reported that according to a source with knowledge of the legendary comic's death, the biopsy by her personal doctor allegedly caused Rivers' vocal cords to spasm and her airways to constrict. 

The doctor who performed the biopsy did so with medical instruments from Yorkville Endoscopy after their own medical professional noticed 'something' on Rivers' vocal cords during the routine surgery, said the source who spoke with the New York Daily News. 

'He asked and they let him,' the source said. 'A huge no-no.'

The source claimed that had the procedure been done in a hospital the comedian might not have died after doctors placed her in a medically induced coma after she went into cardiac arrest that morning. 

The Fashion Police star had only agreed to undergo an endoscopy at the Upper East Side clinic said the source and not the more risky biopsy, which would have tested whatever was removed for cancerous cells. 

No one from Rivers' team commented on the new statement.

The identity of Rivers' doctor, who identified himself as an ear, nose and throat specialist, is not known at this time.

The clinic is federally licensed and according to a spokesperson has performed 18,000 procedures since opening in Feburary 2013.

There is no criminal investigation underway following the legendary comic's death on September 4 at Mount Sinai Hospital, after spending a week in a medically induced coma after going into respiratory and cardiac arrest at the clinic.

Her daughter, Melissa and grandson Cooper had rushed from Los Angeles to be at her side following the botched surgery. 

However, last week the Hollywood Reporter stated the NYPD had looked at the case because it may not be deemed to be from 'natural causes'.

Although it might end up being ruled natural by the medical examiner the cause of death is still not clear so it is routine procedure for the NYPD to investigate.

The New York Department of Health has also launched a review of the clinic.

Last week, a 1985 interview on Good Morning America was discovered in which Rivers revealed that she was suffering from arrhythmia - a condition the causes the heart to beat out of sync.

Rivers referred to it as a 'ladies' problem' that affects one in four women. While relatively common, the heart trouble unnerved her, she confided.

'All of a sudden you'll be on stage and hear 'tha-thump,' she told Lunden, striking her chest with her hand for emphasis. 'It scares the hell out of me.'

Rivers, who had become a poster girl for excessive plastic surgery over the years, explained that going under the knife while suffering from arrhythmia could pose a risk.

'When you go under, say for plastic surgery or something like that, that's when your heart can go out of kilter. So I'm always very careful,' she said in an off-hand remark that has proven eerily prophetic.

An autopsy that has been performed on Rivers failed to find a cause of death pending additional tests.

It has been reported that before going in for surgery, the Fashion Police co-host got a clean bill of health from her doctors and appeared to be in good physical condition.

Yorkville Endoscopy opened 18 months ago and specializes in digestive disorders.

It is owned by 12 highly-respected gastroenterologists, who are affiliated with the nearby Mount Sinai, Lenox Hill and New York Presbyterian hospitals. 

To date, the clinic has not been the subject of any complaints or violations.

According to the clinic's website, there are five state-of-the-art procedure rooms and ambulatory surgical services.

Clinic spokeswoman Tisha Kresler told MailOnline that HIPAA laws prevented staff from disclosing any information about patients.

But the clinic issued a statement after Rivers died saying: 'In the event of an adverse incident, Yorkville Endoscopy would promptly report to appropriate government and regulatory agencies and would proactively co-operate with any government review.'

Any investigation will also include any liability or medical release forms the star signed before the procedure.

RIvers, who first came to prominence in the 1960s was pictured in fine form on stage in New York the night before her admission to Yorkville Endoscopy and was due to perform again in New Jersey the day later.

Her funeral was held on Sunday and was attended by a raft of New York and Hollywood celebrities including Barbara Walters, Whoopi Goldberg and Hugh Jackman.
