After a few nights staying in a hotel, eating out every night or paying extortionate prices for room service can become tiresome. And sometimes, you just want to whip up an easy dinner yourself.

George Egg, a frequent hotel guest around the world, discovered that it is possible to cook a three-course meal using just the objects found inside a standard budget hotel room.

The British comedian has used a trouser press, iron, hairdryer, waste bin, electric towel rail and kettle as cooking tools for his in-room dining.

In-room dining: George Egg has made a name for himself by creating three-course meals in his hotel rooms

George, 41, has made everything from pancakes and fish to ice cream and tiramisu over the years. 

'I've been performing on the stand-up circuit for the last 20 years,' he said.

'I'm really into cooking but often I stay in soulless budget hotels where they serve over-priced and not very good food.

'I would rather cook my own, so I started experimenting and seeing what I could rustle up in my room. There are various ways of heating and cooking things, using just the stuff you find in there.

'I started out doing pretty basic dishes. Now I can do quite advanced stuff, like making ice cream.'

Five years ago, George made short films of hotel room cookery demos as he travelled the world - and they went viral on YouTube. 

Now, he's taking his unique brand of cooking show on the road in a UK tour. 

'It's an hour of stand-up and storytelling about my exploits, while I simultaneously make a starter, a main and a dessert,' he said.

'The food is actually very good and the audience are welcome to eat the dishes, though I always stress it's "at your own risk".

'I have made pancakes, poached fish and ricotta out of those little cartons of UHT milk.

'I have found two ways to make ice-cream. One that doesn't work, I discovered, involves a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher. The other, which does work, involves the nifty use of the ice machine in the corridors of hotels.

'You can use a heated towel rail to make beef jerky, by drying strips of brined meat on it.

'Hotel kettles are tiny but you can poach a sea bass if you cut it into four fillets. I add fennel seeds, too, and make a nice salsa verde.

'I think "This would cost me £18 in the restaurant downstairs, and I've done it in my room without a kitchen".'

George is playing The Victoria, Birmingham, on October 5, where he will perform his cookery show. 

He said: 'I like playing Birmingham.. I grew up in London and live in Brighton now, but my parents met while at teacher training college in Birmingham.

'And, of course, with my name I'm a fan of Mr Egg the greasy spoon.

'On stage with me in Anarchist Cook I have an iron, kettle, minibar and trouser press, plus towels and sachets of sugar and milk.

'With a kettle you can steam, poach and boil; with an iron you can fry and toast.

'I'm particularly proud of the ice-cream invention. I've even made a tiramisu using only the free ingredients provided by the hotel, including milk, biscuits, sugar and coffee.

'I am very stealthy and have never had any complaints from hotels, and I always clean up after myself.'
