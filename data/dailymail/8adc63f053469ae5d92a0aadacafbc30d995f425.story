The countryâ€™s national debt is now so high, over $16.7 trillion, that if the figure was converted into $5 bills it would stretch almost to the moon.

According to the latest available data 
from the U.S. Treasury, the total public debt outstanding is 
$16,738,105,803,858.21, while the distance between the earth and the 
moon is 238,857 miles.

Since President Obama took office the figure has increased by more than $6 trillion, the largest increase to date under any U.S. president.

During the eight-year presidency of George W. Bush, the debt soared by $4.9 trillion.

On
 January 20, 2009, the day President Obama took office, the debt stood 
at $10.626 trillion. The latest posting reflects an increase of over $6 
trillion.

The current national debt figure is also the highest since the end of the second world war. Every man, woman and child in the U.S. currently owes $55,091 for their share of the U.S. public debt.

Of the $5.1 trillion dollars of debt owned by foreign governments, nearly half is owned by China and Japan.

In
 1981, President Ronald Reagan famously said that a stack of $1,000 
bills equivalent to the U.S. government's debt would be about 67 miles 
high. In $5 bills that would only have reach 13,400 miles.

Under President Obama the debt has increased more than $6 trillion, while President Bush added $4.9 trillion
