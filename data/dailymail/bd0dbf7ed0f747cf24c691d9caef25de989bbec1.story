Detectives have arrested a third man in connection with the attempted murder of a police officer in Northern Ireland, who found a bomb under his car. 

A 41-year-old man was detained in west Belfast yesterday.

Two others, aged 25 and 34, were arrested in Belfast on Monday and are still in police custody.

Assassination attempt: Police evacuated residents and closed Upper Newtownards Road whilst army technical experts dealt with a 'viable bomb' found under the police officer's car outside his home

Dismantling: It is believe the policeman discovered the viable bomb himself around 2pm on Sunday afternoon after which security forces were called

The Police Service of Northern Ireland
constable was preparing to take his wife and two children out for 
Sunday lunch when he discovered a viable bomb under his car at his home 
in east Belfast.

Senior officers have said the attack could have killed the policeman and his family.

Police are on high alert after 
dissident republicans attempted to murder the officer with a car bomb 
and a second explosive device was discovered near a police station.

The under-car device was a tactic frequently used by the Provisonal IRA.

PSNI Assistant Chief Constable George Hamilton said the officer's vigilance saved lives.

"If that officer had not checked under his car, we would have been looking at a murder or multiple murders," Mr Hamilton said.

Dissident republicans are being blamed for the attack.

Investigaiton: Armagh Road in Tandragee was sealed off following the discovery of a suspect device close to the local police station

In a separate incident, a pipe bomb 
was found close to the gates of a police station in the town of 
Tandragee in Mid-Ulster, near the homes of elderly residents.

The booby-trap device in Belfast was defused in a controlled explosion by the army.

It was recovered from under the 
officer's car partially intact and police hope forensic tests on the 
remains could identify those who made and planted it.

Mr Hamilton said he was linking the attack to 'anti-peace' dissident republicans, who have already murdered two police officers.

'We are hopeful that it will provide useful evidence,' he said.

'The fact that it was discovered and it didn't ignite means that we obviously have a starting point forensically.'

Stormont’s Justice Minister David 
Ford, who condemned those responsible, said: 'Fortunately, due to the 
officer’s commendable vigilance, the attempt on his life was not 
successful.

'Let us be clear. This was an attack 
not only on a police officer and his family but on our whole community. 
The officer was serving the community; he was working for all of us.

'The people responsible for this and 
other recent attacks have no mandate and speak for no-one. They need to 
recognise the futility of their campaign and respect the wishes of the 
vast majority of our community who want an end to all violent acts.'

Police have been warning for months that republican militants remain determined to kill members of the security forces.

On November 1, prison officer David 
Black was shot dead as he drove along the M1 motorway on his work to 
work at the high-security Maghaberry prison in Co Antrim, which houses 
dissident inmates.

A group styling itself the 'new IRA' 
claimed that attack.

Army technical officers examined the object close to the gates of the town's Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) station, a short distance south of Portadown

Elderly residents were evacuated from their nearby homes but have been allowed to return as the security alert has ended

Northern
Irish dissidents have repeatedly targeted security force members in 
recent years in a bid to destabilise the peace process.

In November long-serving prison officer David Black, 52, was shot dead in a motorway ambush in Co Armagh as he drove to work.

The attack was claimed by a group styling itself the 'new IRA' 
which was formed in the summer when a number 
of splinter groups joined forces.

In April 2011 newly qualified police 
officer Ronan Kerr (top right), 25, died when a booby trap car bomb 
exploded under his vehicle at his home in Omagh.

The faction was formed in the summer when several 
splinter groups joined forces.

Less than two weeks later, an 
under-car booby-trap bomb was found lying on a road in west Belfast. It 
is believed to have fallen from a soldier's car.

In recent months police in Belfast and
Londonderry have recovered horizontal mortars capable of piercing the 
armour of police vehicles and causing multiple fatalities.

During the past year, police have 
arrested 115 people suspected of dissident republican activity, and 35 
have been charged.

Sixty-four officers have been forced to leave their 
homes during the past five years because of intelligence that they were 
being targeted for potential attack.

Many others have had additional security measures like bulletproof glass installed in their homes.

The chairman of Northern Ireland's 
Police Federation said he would be seeking a meeting with PSNI chief 
constable Matt Baggott to discuss officers' personal security and the 
recruitment of extra staff.

Double threat: The bomb was discovered yesterday afternoon close to the policeman's home which is located near the Police Service of Northern Ireland Headquarters

Terry Spence said more needed to be done to ensure officers' safety at home and at work.

Northern Ireland Office Minister Mike 
Penning said everything Mr Baggott and Stormont Justice Minister David 
Ford had asked for to combat violent groups had been provided and he 
joined Mr Ford in condemning the latest attack.

'Those who are responsible offer 
nothing except terror and misery, not just to this police officer and 
his family but to his neighbours and the wider community,' he said
