Alan Shearer and Martin Keown are the latest pundits to slam Arsenal's leaky defence after their 2-1 defeat by Swansea on Sunday, asking why the likes of experienced centre-half Per Mertesacker could not organise the back line when they led at the Liberty Stadium.

Speaking on Match of the Day 2, former Newcastle striker Shearer blasted Arsene Wenger's side for having so many men ahead of the ball with 16 minutes left while winning 1-0.

Pictures show eight yellow shirts ahead of the ball in Swansea's half before the equaliser, with Bafetimbi Gomis breaking before Gylfi Sigurdsson won a free-kick. The Icelandic midfielder scored the resulting set-piece before Gomis' winner.

Shearer said: 'Arsenal have actually worked their socks off to get themselves in a winning position.

'Ten minutes later you've got seven people ahead of the ball in the final third. Per Mertesacker should be screaming to at least two or three of them to "get back, give me some protection, we're winning 1-0, we don't need another goal." It's naive.'

In midweek, Arsenal were 3-0 up against Anderlecht at the Emirates in the second half, but the Belgian side fought back to earn a draw.

With Arsenal leading 3-2 in the final moments, five of their players were ahead of the ball in the attacking final third, with the visitors going down the other end to score.

Shearer also admitted young defender Calum Chambers had an afternoon to forget in south Wales, tasked with marking man of the match Jefferson Montero at right-back.

'I am amazed Chambers lasted so long on the pitch,' Shearer said. 'He's young, still learning, but from the first minute he struggled. I'm amazed he wasn't taken off.'

Former Arsenal defender Keown believes they should have learned from these mistakes, particularly Mertesacker.

'[Mertesacker's] in the team to organise it, get that shield in place and position people.

'When you're 1-0 up, to throw it away like they did, after what happened in midweek.'

Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher was also scathing in his analysis of Wenger's tactics, even referencing his summer business in the transfer market as a reason why the club are struggling.

He added: 'Chelsea and Arsenal seem miles apart - and that's just because [Jose] Mourinho identified what he needed. His team now look unstoppable as a result.

'They let [Thomas] Vermaelen go and they didn't replace him, these small details always cost Arsenal at the top.

'This stage last year they were top of the league with a healthy lead. The problem for Arsenal, and any team, is that you want to feel like you're making progress.

Sanchez had fired Arsenal into the lead with his 12th goal of the season in all competitions

'They won the FA Cup. The next level, having won a trophy, they should make two or three big signings.

'But with Arsenal you never feel they're going to make those big signings to take you there.

'They had a better season than Chelsea, but now they feel miles apart.

'Mourinho saw areas they needed to improve and signed in those areas. Even from last season [Arsenal] look like they've gone backwards.'
