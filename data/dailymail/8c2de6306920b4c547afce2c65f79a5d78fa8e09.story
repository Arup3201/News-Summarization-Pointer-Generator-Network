Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams has revealed that as part of his exercise regime he jumps up and down on a trampoline with his dog while naked.

In a wide-ranging interview the 66-year-old politician was asked about his unusual hobby after posting on his Twitter account earlier this month that he had been 'trampolining since dawn'.

Mr Adams is becoming known as a frequent user of the social media site using it for political purposes but also for posting scores of pictures of his pets.

In an interview with Irish radio station News Talk, Mr Adams was asked by presenter Sean Moncrieff if he really does enjoying trampolining.

And the TD for Louth explained: 'Yeah I do it naked. I don't do it with any great expertise, I just do it more for enjoyment. We just go out for a bounce for a while.

'The dog does it with me so it saves me having to take him for a walk. The dog loves it. In fact I've caught him doing it on his own.'

The Sinn Fein leader also revealed that the dog can also do back flips and admitted that he too could to tricks on the trampoline, but said he 'wouldn't discuss it publicly.'

He added: 'I have had a dog since I was four or five, so I wouldn't be without one. We trampoline when we get together, to make up for lost time.

'I get home most weekends, sometimes not for the entire weekend. There is something special about hillwalking… with a dog. It’s special.'

The 66-year-old is an avid user of Twitter and posts scores of pictures of his dogs on his social media account 

The politician has almost 77,000 followers on Twitter having joined the site in January 2011. He also said in the interview he likes hillwalking with his dogs 

When also asked if he was a 'hippie' at heart Mr Adams replied: 'One of the things I've learned, and I really believe in this - is that you've got to enjoy whatever is happening around you, and whatever is happening to you.

'And not take yourself too seriously.'
