Our understanding of what lies underneath the world's biggest ice sheet has just grown exponentially.

Scientists at NASA have used decades of research and data from the British Antarctic Survey, images from the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite plus results from years of flyovers by specialized aircraft  measuring changes in the thickness of sea ice, glaciers, and ice sheets,  to create the most detailed rendering of the earth's surface beneath the ice of Antarctica ever.

The new model, Bedmap2, is an update of Bedmap, which was made more than 10 years ago. The new images are a significant improvement on the previous map, containing 25 million additional data points and surface and sub-ice features that were too small to be seen in the previous data-set.

The new map of the ice-covered landmass is important for scientists studying the effects of climate change because Antarctica plays a pivotal role within the global climate system, affecting ocean currents and raising sea levels. Its influence will increase as the globe continues to warm.

Researchers previously used a variety of methods to attempt to predict how Antarctica will react to a changing climate, but the limited information about the depth of the ice and the surface of the bedrock made it imprecise.

Remote: It's no wonder people have never seen what the surface of the earth beneath Antarctica's snow looks like - in some places, the ice is three kilometres thick

Now with Bedmap2, researchers can use the detailed map and its new data on average bedrock depth, deepest point and ice thickness to more accurately predict how the continent will react to future climactic conditions.

From a distance: The Antarctic ice sheet covers 98 per cent of the continent and contains more than half of the world's fresh water

The more accurate the map, the better 
scientists can understand the impact that melting ice from Antarctica 
will have on the rest of the planet. 

Antarctica’s ice isn't static but constantly flows outwards.

'Ice sheets grow because of snow, and like honey poured on a plate, spread outward and thin due to their own weight,' Sophie Nowicki, an ice sheet scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, told NASA.gov.

Knowing the shape of the bedrock beneath the ice and the thickness 
of the ice itself allows scientists to simulate the movements of the ice
and predict how it will move in the future.

'It will be an important resource for the next generation of ice sheet modelers, physical oceanographers and structural geologists,' said Peter Fretwell, British Antarctic Survey scientist and lead author of the project.
