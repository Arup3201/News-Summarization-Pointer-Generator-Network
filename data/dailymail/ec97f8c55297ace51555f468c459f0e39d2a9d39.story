Scores of nostalgic motorists were taken back to the swinging 60s this weekend as they cruised along Brighton seafront on their scooters - fifty years after their infamous clash with the Rockers.

The annual Mod Weekender event invites Mods back to their spiritual home, with many riders donning their finest mod gear for the occasion.

The gathering, which has been running for 10 years, saw the enthusiasts enjoy food, live music and a hotly-contested scooter competition at 
Volks Tavern, near Brighton Pier - where the scooters arrive in iconic 
mod film Quadrophenia.

Later in the day many of the enthusiasts rode their scooters - heavily adorned with flags, patches and 60s memorabilia - from Brighton to Beachy Head

The light-hearted atmosphere in Brighton this weekend was very different to that of fifty years ago, when more than 1,000 youths clashed on the seafront on May 18, 1964.

A simmering rivalry between the mods and the rockers 
reached a flashpoint as they clashed repeatedly on seaside piers and 
promenades across the country.

The sight of young rioters surging down the promenade and over the shingle Brighton, stampeding through families to lay into each other under the pier, was a frightening spectacle.

Police fought to control running battles that saw more than 70 arrests 
and deck chairs used as weapons by the warring groups of youths.

The scooter competition was held at Volks Tavern, near Brighton Pier, where the scooters arrive in iconic mod film Quadrophenia, which was inspired by the iconic clash between Mods and Rockers in 1964

The celebration pays tribute to the Mod culture and attracts both enthusiasts who were part of the original wave and younger fans of the movement

But the worst of the violence was 
seen in Brighton, as families were trapped in a shocking showdown which 
sparked moral panic about the state of British youth.

Tensions 
had been rising for some time. The Rockers were usually in their 20s or 
30s; Elvis-loving bikers rooted in 1950s Teddy Boy culture.

The 
teenage Mods’ culture, which flourished in the early 60s, was based on 
continental clothes, Italian Vespa and Lambretta scooters and the music 
of soul and jazz musicians.

Union flags were seen on parkas, bikes and helmets at this weekend's event. Brighton's Whitsun clash was the most notorious of the ones witnessed in 1964, thanks to sensational headlines

They first clashed that spring on the
 March bank holiday in Clacton. At the Essex resort 97 people were 
arrested and the battle lines were drawn.

After that, trouble 
flared from Bournemouth to Margate, up to the bank holiday of August 
1964. But Brighton’s Whitsun clash was the most notorious, thanks to 
sensational headlines and its immortalisation in Mod flick Quadrophenia.

Battles
 ran well into the night but although there were weapons – knives, 
chains and makeshift knuckle dusters – most scuffles involved fists and 
boots.

The pictures of the battles along the seafront and 
pavements in Brighton on that Whitsun bank holiday in 1964 became iconic
 symbols of the era.

The courts were busy for weeks afterwards 
dealing with the 75 youths arrested and the skirmishes were later 
immortalised in the film Quadrophenia.

For the 50th 
anniversary in the sun earlier this year, the fighting had been replaced by a seafront Mini
 Car Rally and a performance by a group of Morris dancers.
