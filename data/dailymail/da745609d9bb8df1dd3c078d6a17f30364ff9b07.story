David Cameron has warned that the UK is battling a 'warped and barbaric' brand of Islamic extremism and that 'military prowess' may be needed to stop it

The UK is in a generational struggle against a poisonous brand of Islamic extremism which will bring terror to Britain if nothing is done to stop it, according to David Cameron.

The Prime Minister has warned that the West faces having an extremist state on the borders of the Mediterranean if IS extremists succeed in their goals.

Cameron has also signalled that airstrikes will not be enough to defeat the terrorist organisation, and has called for  'tough, intelligent, and patient' measures to combat the threat.

Writing in today's Sunday Telegraph, Cameron said Britain will have to use its 'military prowess' to help defeat a 'warped and barbaric' movement before UK citizens become the target of attacks.

Mr Cameron said: 'The creation of an extremist caliphate in the heart of Iraq and extending into Syria is not a problem miles away from home. 

'Nor is it a problem that should be defined by a war 10 years ago. It is our concern here and now.

'Because if we do not act to stem the onslaught of this exceptionally dangerous terrorist movement, it will only grow stronger until it can target us on the streets of Britain. We already know that it has the murderous intent.'

The Prime Minister also vowed action on those recruiting for IS in Britain, saying that anyone posting videos promoting the group will be arrested.

He also pointed to statistics saying that police officers have already removed 28,000 pieces of terrorist related material from the web, including 46 IS videos.

Mr Cameron raised fears that the struggle against the terrorists would last ‘the rest of my political lifetime’.

He was speaking as RAF Tornado jets returned to RAF Akrotiri in western Cyprus after carrying out vital ‘recon’ sorties over Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq.

No 10 officials denied Mr Cameron was paving the way for British military action in Iraq – which he has repeatedly ruled out. 

Mr Cameron said that IS setting up an Islamic caliphate in the Middle East was a problem for Britain, and said any action there should not be defined by the previous Iraq was

But diplomatic observers seized on his reference to the 2003 Iraq War, seen by most as a catastrophe for Iraq and Britain, as well as for Mr Blair personally. 

Government insiders said Mr Cameron’s comments were meant to signal that he refused to accept the Iraq War was the cause of the current crisis – or that Britain had no right to be involved in attempts to tackle it.

The Observer is also reporting that senior figures in the Church of England have penned a letter to Mr Cameron attacking his Middle East policy as incoherent and badly planned.

Written bythe bishop of Leeds, Nicholas Baines, with the support of the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, the letter says policy seems to be dictated by 'the loudest media voice at any particular time'.

The note also accuses the Government of abandoning Christian minorities in Iraq feeling extremists in the city of Mosul, while leaping to the defence of Yazidis trapped on Mount Sinjar.

Baines writes: 'Does your government have a coherent response to the plight of these huge numbers of Christians whose plight appears to be less regarded than that of others?

'The French and German governments have already made provision [for Christians driven from their homes], but there has so far been only silence from the UK government.'
