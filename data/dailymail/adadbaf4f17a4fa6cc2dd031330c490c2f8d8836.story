Castleford fullback Luke Dorn expects to be out of action for just one week despite suffering a horrible facial injury in action.

The Aussie hardman suffered the stomach-turning injury in the 55th minute of Friday night's 30-16 win against Salford.

Fortunately the former London Broncos player was using a mouth guard that ensured he kept all his teeth during the clash.

Fortunately for Dorn he was wearing a mouth guard so left the collision with all his teeth still intact  

Dorn told The Sun: 'Hopefully I'll miss one game. The docs said it was one of the most complex jobs they had seen.'

However, coach Daryl Powell doesn't hold the same confidence, he admitted: 'Luke doesn't look good from what the medical guys tell me.'

Dorn later took to Twitter to play down the severity of the injury to well-wishing fans, describing the injury as 'nothing some lip balm won't fix.'
