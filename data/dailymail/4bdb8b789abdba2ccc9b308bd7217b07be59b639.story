A senior World Rugby head-injuries expert has clashed with the RFU over the presentation of concussion data contained in their annual injury audit.

RFU head of medicine Dr Simon Kemp this week published a report drawn up by a Bath University student - which showed reported concussions in professional Rugby Union had risen by more than 400 per cent in the last decade.

Kemp, whose position was supported by Premier Rugby and the Rugby Players Association, claims the dramatic rise has been caused by increased awareness of a problem which was highlighted by the shambolic handling of George North’s double head injury in Wales’ RBS Six Nations opener against England.

But that view is strongly contested by Professor Willie Stewart, who sits on World Rugby’s concussion advisory panel.

‘The underlying trend over 10 years in professional rugby has seen a year-on-year increase in concussions,’ Stewart told the Mail on Sunday.

‘I do not believe this has anything to do with greater awareness of concussion. Instead, it reflects a steady rise in concussion rates over 10 years as on-field collisions have got bigger.

‘People are more aware because the problem is much greater than it ever used to be.’

The Injury Surveillance Project - formerly known as the Injury Audit - found that 86 concussions were reported last season, a rise of almost 60 per cent from the 2012-13 season. 

Rugby’s concussion rate of 10.5 per 1000 hours compares to 2.5 in 2002 when Dr Kemp initiated the data project.

Professional boxing has a concussion rate of 17.5 per 1000 hours and Dr Kemp admits rugby should brace itself for continued rises in future seasons.

There was public outcry last weekend when Wales winger North was allowed to play on despite television replays appearing to show him knocked unconscious on two separate occasions against England.

North passed the controversial Head Injury Assessment after the first incident and was allowed to carry on playing following the second injury. 

‘If North had been a boxer he would have been removed from the arena after his first concussion and taken for neurological assessment,’ said Stewart. ‘A brain-injured boxer would have stood down for a minimum 28 days.

‘I would say the level of brain injury in professional rugby has now become unacceptable,’ Stewart added.
