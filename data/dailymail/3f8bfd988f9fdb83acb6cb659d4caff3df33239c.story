When David Luiz was sold to Paris Saint-Germain for around £50million last summer, most Chelsea fans couldn't quite believe that their club had acquired such a fee for the Brazilian.

Last season saw Luiz slip down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge as Jose Mourinho put his faith in John Terry and Gary Cahill leaving the 27-year-old limited to the occasional appearance in defensive midfield.

However, when analysing the Brazilian's statistics in a PSG shirt, there is an argument that Luiz has actually been outshining the 2014-15 Blues backline.

In his 25 Ligue 1 and Champions League games for the Parisians, Luiz has won an impressive 147 duels which is more than Chelsea's defensive duo Cahill (116) and Terry (122). 

Luiz, who can often be seen stepping in front of his opponents in a bid to win the ball quickly, has also recorded 60 interceptions - more than Cahill and Terry's combined total of 47. 

It must be said that Luiz is now playing for arguably the best team in a far less competitive league, but his figures still go some way to proving that he still had a lot to offer Chelsea - particularly with the dip in form of England vice-captain Cahill.

After several poor performances in a blue shirt, Cahill has had to look on as French youngster Zouma flourishes with every chance he is given by Mourinho and the 20-year-old has already made nine appearances in a blue shirt.

Despite conceding just 20 Premier League goals so far this season, the Chelsea defence has rarely looked as solid as games in which Nemanja Matic and Luiz sat in front of the back four last season for the west London club's biggest games such as the 1-0 victory against Manchester City in February, 2014. 

Blues fans will argue that Luiz's style of play would be too dangerous now that their team play a more expansive, possession-based games following the introductions of Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa.

Terry, who has been easily Chelsea's best defender this season, has managed a whopping 145 clearances so far while chipping in with five goals in just 30 games. 

Cahill and Terry look set to partner each other against on Tuesday night as Chelsea travel to the Parc de Princes in search of an away win in the Champions League last 16 first leg. 

Speaking ahead of the European clash, Luiz told a packed press conference: 'I think and I hope in this room, I am valued more than £50m.'

He'll certainly be out to prove that point to Mourinho and Co when the Brazilian lines up against his former club on Tuesday.
