A Yorkshire company has beaten global giants to invent the ‘holy grail’ of light bulbs: a low energy unit which is as bright as a traditional bulb.

Well-Lit claims it has solved the shortcomings of LED lightbulbs, which have so far been unable to match the brightness of old-style incandescent bulbs.

The new bulbs use 85 per cent less energy and will last up to nine years, according to the firm which is based in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.

It has done this using a new type of chip that improves phosphor conversion, which is the process by which light particles from an LED chip are converted to a different colour.

Well-Lit’s founder and managing director Chris Stimson, 36, said: ‘We’re excited to get our revolutionary bulbs out the public.

‘When someone says “they are as bright as a normal bulb”, that’s what I want to hear. It’s like the holy grail of the LED world.’

The brightness of bulbs is measured by the Colour Rendering Index (CRI), which gives a score out of 100 to determine how vivid a light source makes the true colours appear.

Almost every single LED lamp currently on sale in the UK only has a CRI rating of around 80 - that is 20 per cent less than the traditional incandescent bulbs, according to Well-Lit. 

But Well-Lit’s new units, which start at around £10 (£16), claim to have pushed that number up to 97.

‘To achieve our market leading Colour Rendering levels we produced a “sunlight white” performance LED device,’ said Mr Stimson.

He added that they used a series of unique quality control methods in the LED production process to make the bulb shine as bright as possible.

‘Our method for producing white light using a new type of chip and multiple phosphor conversion achieved a day light white LED light that is far superior to the light emitted by other LED Lamps,’ he said.

LED bulbs last for 100,000 hours compared with 10,000 hours for fluorescent tubes and 1,000 hours for tungsten filament light bulbs.

They also use around 90 per cent less energy than incandescent bulbs. 

However, up until now, they have struggle to maintain the same level of brightness.

Their technology uses blue LEDs, which last week landed three Japanese-born scientists the Nobel Prize in physics after they invented it in the 1990s.

Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano of Japan and U.S. scientist Shuji Nakamura won the award for their invention, which has led to the use of environmentally-friendly light sources worldwide.

Estimates suggest LED technology, used in everything from homes to billboards today, will be worth £50 billion ($80 billion) in 2020.
