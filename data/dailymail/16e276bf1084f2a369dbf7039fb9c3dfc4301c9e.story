On the street: Madonna's eldest brother Anthony Ciccone is homeless in Michigan

While Madonna flits between fabulous homes with the African children she rescued from poverty, her own eldest brother is destitute and sleeping rough.

Anthony Ciccone, 55, says he has been living under a river bridge in Michigan for 18 months, his only shelter a sleeping bag and his sole companion another street dweller named Michael.

Mr Ciccone said he had been among the homeless in the ski resort of Traverse City since losing a job at his father’s vineyard and winery six miles away.

‘My family turned their back on me, 
basically, when I was having a hard time,’ he said. ‘You think I haven’t
answered this question a bazillion times – why my sister is a 
multi-bazillionaire and I’m homeless on the street? Never say never. 
This could happen to anybody.’

Mr
Ciccone said it made him angry when some thought it funny that the 
brother of such a famous star should end up living under a bridge.

But
while providing him with financial help would barely scratch 
53-year-old Madonna’s £400million-plus fortune, he is adamant that he 
wants none of her money – whether it is offered or not.

‘I’m
not looking to get a free handout because of my sister,’ he said. ‘I’m 
not looking for any publicity.’ He instead relies on the generosity of 
soup kitchens run by local churches for food.

Mr Ciccone, who claimed he once worked in
Alaska’s fishing industry and as a  photographer’s assistant in New 
York, now makes a few dollars doing odd jobs and collecting bottles and 
cans from people’s dustbins.

Madonna was born in 1958 to Madonna 
Louise Ciccone, a French Canadian, and Silvio ‘Tony’ Ciccone, an Italian
American engineer with General Motors and Chrysler. The family lived in
a small brick house in Pontiac, Michigan.

They have claimed that they were not poor but ‘lower middle-class’.

Apart
from Anthony, Madonna has four direct siblings – Martin, a failed 
rapper, Paula, a dancer and singer, Christopher, an interior designer 
and artist, and Melanie, a music publicist.

Their
mother died of cancer in 1963, and a few years later their father 
married their housekeeper Joan Gustafson and had two more children –  
Jennifer, thought to be a human resources consultant, and music PR 
Mario. In 1995, Tony set up the Ciccone Vineyard in Sutton’s Bay. He 
produces  wine named after his famous daughter.

Madonna, who has two children and controversially adopted two young Malawians, has had a difficult relationship with her siblings.

In 2008, Christopher published a damning book about his life working for her, portraying her as self-obsessed, manipulative and so imperious she expected to spit out her cough drops into his hand.

‘I think, ultimately, she’s a lonely person and, unfortunately, it truly is lonely at the top,’ he said. Another brother, Martin, has suffered from alcoholism.

Although the star reportedly paid for
some of his rehab treatment, she did not invite him to her 2000 wedding
to Guy Ritchie, supposedly worried that he would sell his story to the 
media.

Anthony has refused to say how he 
ended up destitute but local people describe him as ‘friendly’ and 
‘coherent’, showing no signs of any drink or drug problems.

Madonna has 
not commented on Anthony, while their father also declined to discuss 
him yesterday.

who broke into Madonna’s London home was locked up indefinitely 
yesterday after doctors found he posed a ‘serious risk’ to her.

Matlok, a schizophrenic 30-year-old, was detained after breaking into 
the singer’s £10million townhouse and rifling through her bedclothes.

The Polish national, who also broke into the home of Madonna’s 
ex-husband Mr Ritchie and helped himself to cigars before trying on his 
clothing, was also given a restraining order.

He was banned from contacting Madonna or her family, or visiting any of their properties.

The court heard how the star had feared for her own and her children’s safety after the break-in.

Matlok was spared deportation because of what was described as his ‘great desire’ to return to Poland once he is well.
