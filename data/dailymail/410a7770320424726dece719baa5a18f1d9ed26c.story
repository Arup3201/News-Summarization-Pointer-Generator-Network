John Smith's Extra Smooth is to be watered down from 3.8 per cent alcohol to 3.6 per cent next month

The brewer of one of Britain's best known beers is watering down its famous drink in a move which could see it make savings of £6.6million in duty annually.

John Smith's Extra Smooth is to be reduced from 3.8 per cent alcohol to 3.6 per cent, but its manufacturers say research suggests the reduction does not compromise on the taste.

Dutch brewer Heineken, which owns the John Smith's brand, is to bring the reduction into effect next month, along with a price increase of about 2.5p a pint.

It has said the 'no nonsense beer' will be brought more in line with the smooth ales of competitors which are already at or below the 3.6 per cent mark.

With UK beer duty rising at two per cent above inflation annually, since the introduction of the beer escalator introduced in 2008, beers with weaker alcohol content pay a lower rate of duty than higher strength rivals, The Financial Times has reported.

A Heineken UK spokesman said the savings would be invested into the brewing and marketing of the beer.

The spokesman said: 'Extensive research conducted with retailers and consumers consistently confirmed that a 0.2 per cent reduction in [alcohol content] does not compromise on the taste and quality.'

Heineken has blamed the increase on the rising cost of energy and ingredients, along with the higher beer duty.

Meanwhile, members of a working men's club in Grimethorpe, a mining village 25 miles from John Smith's brewery in Tadcaster, North Yorshire, have warned the move to raise the price and weaken the beer has not gone down well.

Club secretary Philip Evans said: 'We are going to sit the rep down and tell him it either goes down or it goes out.'

The Treasury raises £9.2bn annually from the production and sale of beer, according to the British Beer and Pub Association.

The association has said while British drinkers were developing a liking for ales at a weaker strength, it did not expect many brewers to alter the alcohol percentage of its products as they had to be sure it wouldn't affect the flavour.
