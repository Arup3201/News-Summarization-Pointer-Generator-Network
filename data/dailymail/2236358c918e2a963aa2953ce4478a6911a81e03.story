Deep within a Cumbrian fell, my head torch flickers as I cling to a rock, heart in mouth.

Taking a deep breath, I launch myself into Honister Slate Mine’s newly opened climbing experience, near Keswick.

It is an underground version of their celebrated Via Ferrata, where willing victims are clamped to the cliff face. But this is an all-weather sport, as the mine maintains a constant temperature of 11C all year round.

Down and in: Honister Slate Mine has been repurposed as a venue for action and adventure in Cumbria

Harnessed and helmeted, I follow my guide Joe Weir for 90 minutes through a maze of trails - including dizzying crawls on iron-rung ladders and tiptoes across tight-rope bridges.

Metal footholds and cables have been hammered into the walls of vast caverns - blasted open for their precious green slate throughout the centuries.

First mined by the Romans, Honister is Britain’s last working slate mine, with 11 miles of tunnels chipped into the 2,126 ft- high Fleetwith Pike, and more still being discovered.

The section that forms the Climb The Mine experience was last worked in 1966 and everywhere you notice the rusting remnants of its past - from old pulleys to decayed pipes.

The beam from my head torch picks up a spade, flung on the ground as though its owner had just popped out for a tea break.

Low tunnels link the three main climbing caverns, most with tracks running through them on the ground. ‘You’d never be standing upright inside the tunnels,’ Joe says, his words echoing as we duck down.

‘You’d always be stooped from the effort of pushing a cart full of slate out of the mine on these tracks.’

Mining has a long tradition in Joe’s family - his uncle and grandfather were rivers, splitting blocks of green slate into thin sheets that could then be shaped into everything from roof tiles to headstones.

As mine manager, Joe now oversees the blasts - but he also finds peace inside the impossibly black caves, silent but for the occasional drip of water.

‘Sometimes I go deep in the tunnels, turn my torch off and see if I can find my way out using the breeze from the entrance,’ he says.

I soon see what he means as the cold air stings my face the closer we get to one of the mine’s exits, emerging to a dramatic mountain pass view with rugged grey cliffs unfurling beneath us.

I’m thankful to be back on terra firma at Scafell Hotel, a former country house in nearby Borrowdale and reward my efforts with a steak and cheese board served, fittingly, on Honister slate.
