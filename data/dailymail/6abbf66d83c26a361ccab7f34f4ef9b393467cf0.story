A man is accused of flinging dildos out of his car with teenage girls nearby in multiple instances, then lingering in his vehicle to watch them.

Konrad Peters, 28, a Milwaukee resident, was arrested and is accused of exposing children to harmful materials, The Smoking Gun reported.

Peters is accused of being involved in three separate instances in West Allis involving the dildos. His alleged victims range in age from 13 to 15 years old.

Busted: Konrad Peters is accused of being involved in tossing dildos from his car in three separate instances

A court filing obtained by The Smoking Gun said '33 dildos and multiple sex toys' were discovered.

A search warrant obtained by the website revealed that two girls told police September 8 that in a September 4 incident, a black car 'would drive past the alley they were walking down and slow down as it drove by them.'

At one point, the car 'stopped about 100 feet in front of them,' the warrant said. 'The driver of the vehicle opened the driver side door and placed an unknown object on the ground. The driver then shut the door and proceeded to drive past the girls.'

The two girls inspected and found it to be a 'giant purple dildo' and told the police the man who put it there 'was sitting there staring at them from his care with the driver's side widow rolled down,' the warrant said. The dildo was gone the next day, the girls told police.

West Allis police, whose headquarters are seen here, arrested Peters. He is accused of exposing children to harmful materials 

The day after the girls spoke to police, a third girl told police of a similar instance, in which a male driver 'threw an item out of the driver's side window, which rolled slightly underneath the car. The driver parked [...] and waited for [the victim's] reaction to the item that was thrown out of the car window. She noted the item was wrapped in clear plastic wrapping tape and was in the shape of a dildo. '

A fourth girl spoke to police on October 8, saying earlier that day she saw a driver fling a dildo out of his car.

During her walk home, the girl 'walked past her house, because she was scared and didn't want him to know where she lived,' the warrant said.

The dildo was photographed by the girl, and told her father what earlier happened during her walk. He reportedly looked at a garage security tape and later drove around to find the car.

West Allis police identified Peters, the warrant said. Peters reportedly contacted his lawyer and did not speak to them.

'All female juvenile victims were shown photo arrays to see if an identification could be made,' the warrant said. '[The third victim] positively identified Konrad Peters as the male party who she observed tossing the sex toy out of his car.'
