New video from a Salt Lake City police officer's body camera shows the moment he opened fire and shot dead an unarmed man in August. 

Prosecutors released the footage on Tuesday as they announced that they had ruled the shooting of 20-year-old Dillon Taylor was justified.  

The video shows Officer Bron Cruz arrive at a 7-11 on August 11 after police were called on a report that 'gangbangers' had 'flashed a gun' in the area. As two other men raised their hands and surrender, Taylor can be seen walking away from the officer. 

Cruz draws his pistol as he screams 'Get your hands out now! Get 'em out!' Taylor can be heard saying: 'Nah, fool.'

Deadly encounter: Officer Bron Cruz's body camera and microphone captured his shooting of Dillon Taylor on August 11 in Salt Lake City. Taylor can be seen here walking away from the officer

The final moment: Taylor turned around with his hands in his pants (left) then lifted his shirt with one hand still concealed (right). It was at this moment that Cruz pointed his pistol and fire twice - fatally wounding Taylor

When Taylor turns around to face Cruz, both of his hands are in his sweatpants. He then lifts up his shirt with one hand as while his other remains in his pants. 

Cruz fires two shots in quick succession, striking Taylor in the chest and the abdomen. 

The shooting came just two days after unarmed teen Michael Brown was gunned down by an officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Taylor's death sparked outrage from much of the public in Salt Lake City and fury from his family. Marchers protested the killing as unlawful and unjustified.

However, on Tuesday, Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said that Cruz had every reason to believe that Taylor was armed and dangerous. 

'By the time Dillon drew his hands from his waistband, Officer Cruz’s belief that Dillon was presenting a weapon was reasonable,' he said, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

The shooting death of Taylor, which came two days after the slaying of an unarmed teen in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked protests in the streets of Salt Lake City

Taylor crumpled to the ground after being shot in the chest and the abdomen. He was not armed - nor were the friends he was with when the police arrived

Cleared: Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill announced Tuesday that he had cleared Cruz of wrongdoing and said he acted within his training - even though police

Gill also suggested that Taylor may have been committing 'suicide by cop.' The 20-year-old had a felony warrant out for his arrest at the time and had posted on Facebook days earlier: 'I feel my time is coming soon, my nightmears are telling me. im gonna have warrants out for my arrest soon ... ill die before I go do a lot of time in a cell.'

Taylor's family say he could not hear the officer's instructions to show his hands because he had earphones in and was blasting music. 

A toxicology report found his blood alcohol level was 0.18percent at the time  

They also faulted officers for making assumptions about the danger Taylor posed based only on the word of a 911 caller who had claimed: 'They’re obviously looking for trouble, just the way they look.'

The shooting is still under review by Salt Lake police and Cruz could still potentially face disciplinary action from the department.

The prosecutor's ruling means he will not face criminal charges. 

Cruz told investigators after the shooting: 'I was scared to death. The last thought I had go through my mind when I pulled the trigger ... was that ‘I was too late. I was too late.’ And because of that I was gonna get killed.'
