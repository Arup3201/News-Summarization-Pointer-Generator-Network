Sir Ian Andrews, who is chairman of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, has been accused of protecting the industry his wife plays a prominent role in

A senior police officer who refused to
name companies that hired corrupt private investigators is married to a
leading figure in the industry.

Yesterday it emerged that the wife of 
Sir Ian Andrews, chairman of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, is a 
senior lawyer for G3 Good Governance Group, a global security and 
investigations firm.

Moira Andrews worked for the Crown 
Prosecution Service and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office before 
taking the role of general counsel for the firm in 2011.

Last night MPs raised concerns that 
Sir Ian, a former Ministry of Defence mandarin, had failed to disclose 
his wife’s job when giving evidence about private investigators to the 
Home Affairs Committee in June.

A senior Conservative member of the 
committee, James Clappison, said: ‘Although it is not strictly required 
of witnesses, it would have been wise for Sir Ian to have declared this 
relationship, especially given the circumstances of this extremely 
sensitive inquiry.

‘I am very surprised that he failed to mention this.’

Soca said last night that Sir Ian ‘did
not consider there to be a conflict of interest that should be 
declared’ and would write to Home Secretary Theresa May and committee 
chairman Keith Vaz to explain this.

It later published a letter to Mr 
Vaz in which Sir Ian said it was a ‘matter of public record’ that after 
leaving the FCO in 2011 his wife worked for G3, ‘amongst other 
independent interests’.

He described G3 as a ‘strategic 
advisory consultancy specialising in providing advice on managing 
opportunities, risk mitigation, governance and regulatory  compliance, 
particularly in emerging markets’.

SOCA has attracted criticism for its lack of transparency from senior MPs who are investigating the scandal

He distanced himself from decisions 
about the report and the inquiry into private investigators, saying 
these were ‘completed or initiated’ before he became chairman of Soca.

He said the decision to keep a list of
those using private investigators secret was made by the agency’s 
director general, Trevor Pearce, on legal advice.

A spokesman for Mr Vaz said he was ‘not aware’ of Mrs Andrews’ employment.

G3 said: ‘It is a matter of public 
record that Moira Andrews has been general counsel of G3 Good Governance
Group since 2011, a role which she has filled on a part-time basis.’
