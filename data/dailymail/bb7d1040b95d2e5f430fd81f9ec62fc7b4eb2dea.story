Traditional remedies for the condition have always been a rather hic and miss affair.

But the days of attempting to drink water upside down, having someone inflict a shock on you, or holding your breath as long as  possible could be over.

An inventor claims to have developed a device that stops the hiccups every time.

The Hiccup Stick works by recreating the traditional cure of drinking water upside down, without the mess

It is little more than a plastic 
stick with a hole in the middle. The user bites down on the stick and 
drinks a glass of water through the hole.

It appears the hiccups are stopped by
 the combination of drinking the water and biting the stick, which makes
 the throat muscles tense.

The idea was developed after inventor
 Chuck Ray had a bout of hiccups and decided to experiment by drinking a
 glass of water with a pen in his mouth – and it eased his symptoms. He 
said: ‘They didn’t stop immediately but it was enough to make me believe
 I was on to something.’

Inventor Chuck Ray came up with the idea in frustration after suffering from bouts of hiccups throughout his life and trying to cure them by drinking water through a pen

He spent a month developing his idea 
and getting it tested. Mr Ray added: ‘Soon I was getting calls back from
 people who were amazed at the results. In every single case it worked 
to stop hiccups, from kids as young as three to adults in their 80s.

‘It even worked with several people with more serious chronic hiccups.’

More than 10,000 Hiccup Sticks have now been sold at a cost of £13 for a pack of three online.

Hiccups are a result of the layer of 
muscle below the ribcage, known as the diaphragm, suddenly and 
involuntarily contracting. Not all doctors are convinced by Californian 
Mr Ray’s idea, pointing out that hiccups normally subside anyway.

The Hiccup Stick may help those such 
as Lisa Doherty, of Lincoln, who has been hiccuping every day for almost
 five years since she was expecting her daughter Emily. Despite giving 
birth in June 2008 and having a second daughter Sophie this year, her 
hiccups have not stopped. 

She said: ‘It’s usually just one very loud one every hour. I’ve tried everything, all the old wives’ tales.’
