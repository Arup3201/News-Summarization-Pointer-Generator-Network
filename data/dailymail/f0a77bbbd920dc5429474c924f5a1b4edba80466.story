Jeremy Hunt is to launch a wide-ranging attack on GPs, claiming some do not even know their patients’ names.

In a major speech, the Health Secretary will condemn the scandal of out-of-hours services where ‘you speak to a doctor who doesn’t know you from Adam’.

In a frank assessment of the failings of ‘largely reactive’ surgeries, he will insist family doctors must once again take ultimate responsibility for round-the-clock care.

Personal service: Patients should know that one family doctor (file picture) is responsible for them, and even if their GP is not on call it will be clear that 'the buck stops' with them, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will say

He will liken surgeries to ‘mini A&E units’ where doctors are struggling to cope with the huge volume of patients.

And in a response to growing concern over the quality of care outside office hours, the Health Secretary will unveil a new chief inspector of GPs, whom he says will crack down hard on surgeries that fail to provide a good service at all times.

Patients should know that one family doctor is responsible for them, and even if their GP is not on call it will be clear that ‘the buck stops’ with them, he will say.

The Daily Mail has repeatedly highlighted the scandal of out-of-hours care.

Last week it emerged that Harmoni, Britain’s biggest provider of such care, was paying GPs £1,350 a shift because managers were so desperate to cover evenings and weekends. The firm has also had to use senior nurses to cover whole districts overnight.

In the speech, which he will make to the King’s Fund health think-tank on Thursday, Mr Hunt will also respond to growing problems in hospital accident and emergency units, where admissions have soared because, he says, there is ‘no credible alternative’.

‘Everyone agrees that hospitals should only be a last resort for the frail elderly and that – for someone perhaps with dementia and other complex conditions – A&E departments can be extremely confusing places,’ he will say.

‘But what alternatives do we offer? GP surgeries where it is often impossible to get an appointment the next day; same day appointments but only if you call at 8 o’clock in the morning sharp and are lucky getting through; long waits on the phone to get through, sometimes at premium rates; difficulty in registering with another practice if you move home, or aren’t happy with the service you are receiving; out-of-hours services where you speak to a doctor who doesn’t know you from Adam and has no access to your medical record.’

Mr Hunt will argue Labour made a ‘historic mistake’ by allowing GPs to opt out of out-of-hours care and paying them ‘not for looking after people as individuals, but for complying with a myriad of targets and requirements’.

He is understood to want to move away from a contract which pays doctors for hitting targets to one based on the quality of care round the clock.

Under Labour’s 2004 renegotiation of their contracts, GPs were allowed to hand responsibility for out-of-hours care to private firms such as Harmoni.

The new contract, Mr Hunt will say, removed ‘at a stroke the need to think holistically about a patient’s entire needs.’

It meant some of the traditional work of the family doctor, such as ringing elderly patients just out of hospital, ‘is too often forgotten or left undone’.

He will say: ‘As a member of the public, I want to know my GP. And I want my GP to be someone that knows me and my family.

'Yet we’ve turned GP practices into places where it’s a daily challenge for receptionists to cope with huge call volumes and GPs to get through to all the people they need to see.’

Andy Burnham, Labour’s shadow health secretary, said: ‘A&E has deteriorated sharply on David Cameron’s watch and it’s not good enough for his Government to blame others – it is a mess of their making.

‘In 2009, 98 per cent of people were seen within the four-hour A&E target. David Cameron should stop trying to blame the crisis in A&E on something that happened ten years ago.’
