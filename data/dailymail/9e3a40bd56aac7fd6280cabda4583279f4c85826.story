Passengers will be offered the chance to buy an all-inclusive ticket by easyJet for the first time in its 18-year history in a move that could signal a change in direction for budget airliners.

The Luton-based firm has announced it is to start offering some passengers the opportunity to pay one price for their ticket, which will entitle them to choose their seat, place their bag in the hold, and pay by credit card.

Up until now the firm has charged customers less than many of its rivals for the seat itself, but then boosted profits with a raft of costs for extra services, such as inflight food and drink, which other carriers include for free.

Change: EasyJet is to charge one price for an all-inclusive ticket for the first time in its 18-year history

The airline claims its new all-inclusive fare will be lower than if customers had chosen to book all the extras on top of their standard ticket.

To begin with, the deal will only be available to business travellers who book through corporate systems.

But it is still being seen as a sign that the giants of the budget airline market could be about to change the way they do business.

Some carriers, such as Irish firm Ryanair, even charge extra if customers book by credit and debit card when there is little alternative available.

They argue that they are simply giving passengers the option to strip out extra costs that they do not need in order to secure the lowest possible price.

EasyJet, one of the no-frills pioneers since it set up in 1995, is introducing an all inclusive fare in a bid to win more corporate travel bookings from big name rivals.

They say that not only will the fare be cheaper than if customers were to buy each of the options separately, it will also be less time-consuming, a factor that might appeal to business travellers in particular.

Head of sales Ruth Spratt said: 'We are really pleased to be able to offer an inclusive fare for the first time - part of our campaign to make ourselves easier to book and attractive to large corporates.

'It will help us to compete even more effectively with the legacy carriers as well as providing further choice and value for the 10million-plus corporate travellers who choose to fly easyJet every year.'

Business customers will still have the choice of paying existing standard fares if they are not taking a suitcase or do not mind which seat they get.

Some of the extra charges invoked by budget airlines have caused an outcry in the past.

Last year, Suzy Mcleod was furious after being charged £236 at Ryanair's check-in desk for printing out her boarding cards. Mrs MecLeod usually printed them at home, but had forgotten to on that occasion.

When she set up a Facebook page asking people to support her if they thought she had been treated unfairly, 500,000 people gave her their backing.

It did not cut any ice with chief executive Michael O'Leary, who branded her 'stupid'.

Ryanair has also been banned from advertising flights without the tax included to give the appearance of a cheaper fare, although it does continue to give the pre-tax price on its website.

Last month a flight from London to Ibiza was advertised for £42.99, although that rose to £95.79 once taxes and other costs such as web check-in and an EU levy are added.

Both EasyJet and Ryanair have capitalised on charging people for food, which other airlines include within the cost of the ticket.

EasyJet charges £6 for its all-day breakfast, £1.80 for a cup of tea and £2 for a Cup-a-Soup.

Ryanair charges £2.50 for a cup of tea, £5 for a sandwich, and £5.20 for a small bottle of wine.

Last month Mr O'Leary vowed to keep increasing the cost of placing luggage in the hold until nobody could afford to do it anymore.

It now costs £50 to take place a 15kg bag in the hold for a return trip. EasyJet charges £26 for a 20kg bag.

Mr O'Leary said by increasing the charges the number of passengers placing luggage in the hold had fallen to 19 per cent, saving the airline 'a fortune in money'.

In an interview he even suggested he might consider charging for hand luggage at some point in the future.

Both airlines charge customers extra to book using a credit card as opposed to a debit card.

Typically this is about two per cent of the total ticket price with Ryanair, while easyJet charges slightly more at 2.5 per cent.
