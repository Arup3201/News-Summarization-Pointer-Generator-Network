Those Selhurst Park tears were as much for conceding a 3-0 lead to effectively end Liverpool’s title hopes as for the realisation that an opportunity this golden may not come again soon.

Steven Gerrard will urge his team-mates to ‘go again’ before the start of next season but that task will be made more difficult by the certainty that their rivals will ‘come again’.

Liverpool had appeared like the irresistible force, possessing enough momentum from swashbuckling football and the memories of Hillsborough to sweep to their first league crown in 24 years.

Let's go again: Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard will have a tough job lifting his team-mates next season

Manuel Pellegrini was grappling with the finer points of the Manchester City machine, Jose Mourinho was bemoaning his dearth of quality centre-forwards, and Manchester United were plummeting downwards without the jet-pack that is Sir Alex Ferguson.

It was Liverpool who had the sense of an unstoppable team building to a climax. But Chelsea’s double decker halted the procession, then Tony Pulis’s Black & Decker chopped it to a stand-still.

If City beat Aston Villa on Wednesday night, as seems certain, Liverpool will have missed a glorious chance to finally re-emerge as England’s best.

They may well be better next season for the experience. But you can be assured that so will all their title competitors.

City will improve their defence with Porto centre-back Eliaquim Mangala a likely arrival, while Pellegrini will have a greater grasp on this league having shorn his nearly-man tag.

Chelsea will get a top class striker, with Diego Costa set to provide the spike to Mourinho’s weapon, often so blunt this season.

United will spend big under Louis Van Gaal, and surely be a huge improvement on this campaign.

Arsenal will once again consolidate and, should Aaron Ramsey and Theo Walcott be fit for the campaign, prove challengers again.

Even Everton, with Roberto Martinez a year wiser, and Tottenham, under a new head coach, will spend money to improve.

Liverpool are back among the big boys but they might well rue not picking them off this season, when they all looked that little bit smaller.
