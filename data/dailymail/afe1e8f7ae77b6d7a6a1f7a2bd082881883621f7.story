BBC Radio 4 has set aside ten hours in its New Year's Day schedule to air an adaptation of Leo Tolstoy’s nineteenth century novel War and Peace

There was once a time when a ten-hour radio show based on a work of Russian literature would have been a daunting prospect even the most loyal listener.

But BBC bosses are taking advantage in the boom of online listening and downloadable podcasts by handing over almost the entire New Year’s Day schedule for Radio 4 to a production of War and Peace.

And the adaptation of Leo Tolstoy’s nineteenth century novel is the flagship of the station’s Christmas line-up, that will also see the characters of The Archers put on a full production of Noel Coward’s Blythe Spirit and the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby submit himself to analysis on Desert Island Discs.

Jeremy Howe, Radio 4’s Commissioning Editor for Drama, said yesterday that before the availability of online catch-up he would not have felt confident commissioning a programme on the scale of War and Peace.

He said: ‘[Podcasts and online listening have] changed the way we commissioned dramas. 

'Ten years ago, we would have been slightly reluctant to do a ten-part classic serial but because we now advertise [catch-up listening] as available and it’s there for 30 days, it means if you’ve missed something you can go back and that’s emboldened us to commission big. 

'It’s kind of like the box set philosophy, it’s available when you want it, as well as on air.’

War and Peace, widely regard as one of the most important works in literature, tells the story of the French invasion of Russia and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society through the eyes of five aristocratic families.

The event will be the first time Radio 4 has handed over so much of its schedule to one production on a single day, with War and Peace running from 9am to 9.30pm giving way only to news bulletins, The Archers and an as of yet unannounced comedy programme. 

In 2003, the novel was listed at number 20 on the BBC’s survey The Big Read, which sought to find the country’s best loved novel.

Mr Howe said: ‘It’s the biggest blockbuster of them all, so why don’t we do it in the biggest blockbuster way? 

'So that’s why we’ve stripped out the schedule on a day when we think people will be prepared to sit down and listen to something. 

'One of the things I love about Radio 4 is we will give something the space to do something like that properly, 10 hours is a pretty good stab at War and Peace’.

Gwyneth Williams, the station’s controller, added: ‘We hope lots of Radio 4 listeners will set themselves up with vodka and blinis and dip in and out. So, the reason for doing it is because it’s arguably the best book ever written and if you haven’t made the journey through it, Radio 4 thinks you are really missing out’.

The production will star big names such as John Hurt, Simon Russell Beale, Lesley Manville and Dame Harriet Walter and took a month to record. 

Howe added it had ‘all the logistics of a film shoot because it was so big’, even attending a re-enactment of The Battle of Austerlitz – a major event in the 1,300 page book – in order to record realistic battle sounds.

It is being produced by the award-winning director Timberlake Wertenbaker, who said: ‘I’ve been obsessed with War and Peace ever since I can remember. 

'I read it first in French, then in English and I even tried to read in in Russian – I think I managed about a page. I was living at that time in Washington D.C. with a Princess Volkonskaya who would talk about the book as if it were a family memoir.

Howe added: ‘The place Tolstoy has in the Russian imagination makes Shakespeare look like a Johnny-come-lately in the English imagination’.

The production will also be accompanied by an online digital companion, providing family trees, historical facts and maps to help listeners keep up with the complicated plotlines.

War and Peace will be the longest drama Radio 4 has rolled out in a single day. 

However, they have previously undertaken similar ventures on a lesser scale. 

On Boxing Day in 2000 the station cleared its schedule for an eight-hour reading of JK Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone and, in 2012, there was a five and a half hour production of James Joyce’s Ulysses.
