Blood glucose test: Type 1 diabetics using insulin check their blood sugar levels before every meal. Type 2 diabetics tend to test themselves several times a week

Hundreds of thousands of younger people with diabetes are facing severe complications and could require 'substantial' hospital care in the future, according to an NHS report.

The world's biggest audit of diabetes found that youngsters and those in their 20s, 30s and 40s are at dangerously high risk of serious problems, including kidney failure and stroke.

Diabetics under 54 are less likely 
than those aged 55 to 69 to receive all the basic health checks needed 
to keep their condition under control, it found.

Another
report from campaigning charity Diabetes UK estimates that 10 per cent 
of the NHS budget is spent treating the disease and its complications, 
which is equivalent to £1m an hour.

The latest audit found there are big variations in the types of treatments offered by hospitals
and the prevalence of complications according to social group.

Some
2.5 million people in the UK are diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, which 
is linked to obesity and unhealthy lifestyles, and up to a million more 
are thought to have the condition without knowing it.

A further 300,000 people have Type 1 diabetes, which usually develops in childhood, but both forms of diabetes are on the rise.

Today's audit said a "large cohort" of a whole generation of people with diabetes are expected to require substantial hospital care in the future.

The form of diabetes that blights the lives of millions of middle-aged Britons could be wiped out by cutting calories severely for just two months, research suggests.

After a small-scale trial, diabetics who consumed just 600 calories a day – the amount many people would eat at lunch alone – were able to throw away their tablets.

Eighteen months on, some are still free of type 2 diabetes, which is linked to obesity and usually occurs in middle age.

The Newcastle University researchers 
described the result as remarkable and said it proves that the condition
that affects 2.5million Britons need not be a life sentence.

Dr Iain Frame, of Diabetes UK, which 
funded the study, warned that no one should go on such a drastic diet 
without speaking to his or her doctor.

Almost 300,000 children and under-54s with diabetes have blood sugar levels that are so high they are at high risk of complications.

Another 144,000 have dangerously high risk blood sugar levels while, across all age groups, 800,000 are at high or dangerously high risk.

Serious complications can occur when blood sugar is not kept under control, including limb amputation and blindness.

The National Diabetes Audit 2010 for England and Wales found 42 per cent of those aged 25 to 54 receive the nine basic health checks that should be given by NHS staff, including blood pressure, blood sugar, weight and foot care, compared with 54 per cent of those aged 55 and over.

Across all age groups, two-thirds of Type 1 patients and almost half of Type 2 patients do not receive all nine checks.

Today's report noted that children and younger adults with diabetes are also far more likely to be obese than those who are older.

Nine out of 10 adolescents with Type 2 are overweight or obese - more than any other age group with the condition.

Obesity and diabetes can be a deadly combination, putting people at high risk of heart disease, heart attack and stroke.

Commissioned by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP), which is funded by the Department of Health, the audit includes data for more than 80% of the people diagnosed with diabetes in England.

Bob Young, lead clinician on the audit and clinical lead for the National Diabetes Information Service, said: 'These results ring alarm bells.

'They show that younger people make up a quarter of all those with diabetes yet have the highest risks of potentially preventable complications.

'If these risks could be reduced, much future disability and shortened life expectancy could be prevented.'

Rowan Hillson, national clinical director for diabetes, said there was 'no excuse for not doing the basics well'.

'I am very concerned that the National Diabetes Audit shows that we still have a long way to go in delivering basic standards of diabetes care for everyone.

'In particular, young and middle-aged people with diabetes are not getting the regular checks they need to manage their condition and improve outcomes.

'These checks are vital to reduce serious but avoidable complications.'

Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: 'This highlights the need for urgent action to ensure that people with diabetes start to receive all the basic care processes, otherwise there will be more amputations, more people going blind and more cases of kidney failure, heart disease and stroke.'

Care Services Minister Paul Burstow said: 'Diabetes is one of the biggest challenges facing the NHS today and this report shows that this challenge looks set to increase as more and more people develop diabetes.

'It also highlights unacceptable variations in standards of care for people with diabetes.

'The NHS needs to rise to this challenge. The NHS Health Check programme will help by detecting diabetes sooner, allowing the NHS to provide earlier and better management of the condition through education, care and support.

'Programmes such as Change4Life will help the NHS to work with people to understand the causes of Type 2 diabetes, signposting them to the information they need to help them maintain a healthy lifestyle and reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

'All patients should receive the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) recommended checks without exception.

'Clinical audits such as this are vital in highlighting where this isn't happening so NHS services can be held to account for whether patients are healthy and able to live fulfilling lives.'
