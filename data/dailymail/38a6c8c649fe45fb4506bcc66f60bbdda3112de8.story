Southampton have sounded out Oscar Garcia about a possible move to St Mary’s – with Celtic so far reluctant to grant the Spaniard his dream switch to Glasgow.

Garcia, the former Maccabi Tel Aviv and Brighton manager, last week told Sportsmail of his desire to succeed Neil Lennon in the hot seat in Glasgow’s East End.

Malky Mackay, Owen Coyle, Henrik Larsson and Steve Clarke have also been linked with the Celtic post together with Michael Laudrup, whose representatives were asked earlier in the week if the job would be of interest him.

Roy Keane is also in the running for the job and bookmakers yesterday were cutting the odds on the fomer Manchetser United captain.

Celtic’s problem in recruiting Lennon’s successor appears to be the reluctance of some potential candidates to show their hand – with the current vacancies at Southampton and West Brom muddying the waters.

The south coast club are now compiling a shortlist for the successor to Spurs-bound Mauricio Pochettino and last night they broke cover to ask ex-Barcelona midfielder Garcia if he would be interested in talking to them.

It’s believed, however, that Garcia’s preference would be a crack at the Champions League with Celtic.

Laudrup and Mackay are also thought to be on Saints’ chairman Ralph Krueger’s short-list together with Lennon, Ronald Koeman, Murat Yakin, Steve McClaren, Gus Poyet and Rafael Benitez.

Garcia, who resigned from Brighton after missing out in the semi-finals of the Championship play-offs, is also attracting interest from Malaga.

Laudrup has an offer from Primera Liga strugglers Granada but has so far not committed.

Keane’s link to the managerial vacancy at Celtic surfaced again last night following a flurry of bets placed on the Irish assistant manager.

The odds on Keane being appointed as the next Celtic supremo were dramatically slashed from 33/1 to even money – one firm, BetVictor, went 8/11.

While betting indicators are not always reliable, Sportsmail understands that Keane is firmly on the radar of the Parkhead hierarchy.

Republic of Ireland manager Martin O’Neill has predicted Keane will return to front-line club management and has stated he would not stand in his way should his right-hand man express a desire to move on.

Keane is due to speak to the media at the Aviva Stadium later today ahead of Saturday’s friendly against Italy at Craven Cottage. It’s likely one item will dominate the agenda.

Earlier this week, Keane spoke of his admiration for Celtic, for whom he played half a season for at the end of his career, but declined to push himself forward as a candidate.

‘They are a brilliant club, an absolutely fantastic football club, one of the best in the world. But I have got a job,’ he said.

Since becoming Irish assistant manager, Keane has been linked with jobs at Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest, as an assistant to Louis Van Gaal at Manchester United, and now Celtic.

His profile has also risen with his ITV work where his presence guarantees high ratings.

Celtic’s major shareholder, Dermot Desmond, is a close friend of O’Neill and has direct access to discussing Keane’s suitability for the Celtic job, if required.

The FAI refused to comment on the rising speculation.
