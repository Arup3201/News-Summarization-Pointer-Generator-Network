Long Tall Sally has announced a collaboration with hot online retailer Taller Than Your Average (TTYA).

The 18-piece collection may be out next week but Jourdan Dunn has been given first dibs on the range.

The supermodel, 24, was spotted at London Fashion Week in one of their black and white stripe shirts.

TTYA has already gained a celebrity following with fans including Elle Macpherson, Daisy Lowe, Jessie J, and now Jourdan. 

Long Tall Sally, the go-to fashion retailer for tall women, presents this capsule collection with TTYA, specifically cut for women who stand 5ft 8in or taller.

The range boasts high-quality staples that reflect key new season trends.

Standout pieces include a textured oversized yeti coat, white scuba biker jacket, overly distressed denim, boyfriend style tailoring and two-in-one desk to dinner dress. 

London based fashion stylist Irene Agbontaen, who founded TTYA, knows first-hand about the style  struggles of tall women; sleeves just skimming her wrists, trousers and leggings hovering above her ankles, and dresses cut way too short for comfort.

The 5'11 former ASOS stylist decided to use her years of fashion experience to create the label, which began as a range of ultra-cool 'jersey staples for tall girls'. 

This metallic pencil skirt comes in at £55 - and won't hover above your knees

This £75 metallic maxi comes in a gorgeous nude pink, and looks like it's been pinched from Rihanna's wardrobe (l) a £30 cami is paired with a voluminous scuba midi skirt, £70 (r)

The brand is stocked in some of the world's biggest department stores including Selfridges & Barneys New York, and now launches a  line online with Long Tall Sally.

'I was on a one woman crusade to make tall girls feel style conscious not self-conscious,' says Irene.

Impressed by Irene’s drive and fashion conscious range, and with LTS’s expertise in fit and design, LTS and TTYA decided to join forces and create a capsule collection of key fashion pieces that reflect Irene’s passion for fashion, music and - of course - tall.

'We're thrilled about the partnership,' said Andrew Shapin, CEO of LTS. 'By joining forces, we are able to offer LTS customers another dimension.'

The shoot was captured by fashion photographer Alex Sainsbury and modelled by Irene's close friend Jamie Gunns.

'For me the collection was inspired by building on the tall woman's core staples, making them accessible and fashionable. You can put your own stamp on the collection by mixing it up or keeping it simple with a statement piece.

'I want to empower tall girls to stand tall and be one with who they are. Well-fitting clothes make you look and feel good,' says Irene. 'TTYA is not just about clothes - it's a lifestyle.' 

TTYA x Long Tall Sally launchers September 25 online at longtallsally.com and in selected Long Tall Sally stores. 

The collection will be available in sizes UK 8-18. Prices range from £24-£110.
