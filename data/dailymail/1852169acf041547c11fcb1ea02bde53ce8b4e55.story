There were fears on Wednesday that up to 100 children at a Surry Hills child care centre may have been exposed to tuberculosis after a worker tested positive.

The identity of the centre has been reported in some circles as the Only About Children facility, authorities conceding the children were exposed to the adult on a regular basis.

TB is an infectious airborne disease which can affect any part of the body, but most commonly the lungs.

Not all families of the children have yet been tracked down. 

The Only About Children facility is reportedly the child care centre where the worker who allegedly tested positive to tuberculosis

 'The risk of tuberculosis infection having spread to staff and children is low and treatments for TB are highly effective,' NSW Health's communicable diseases expert Dr Vicky Sheppeard (pictured) said

'The risk of tuberculosis infection having spread to staff and children is low and treatments for TB are highly effective,' NSW Health's communicable diseases expert Dr Vicky Sheppeard said.

Up to 92 kids from 78 families and 15 staff will have to be screened after they were potentially exposed to tuberculosis from an infected worker at the centre.

'Unlike other bacterial infections, TB is not readily spread from child to child and any spread is usually only after prolonged exposure,' Dr Sheppeard added.

A small number of infected persons may not show any signs of the disease, but general symptoms include fever, chills, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss and fatigue and in some cases, it can be fatal.

Those exposed to the disease will have a skin test, a chest X-ray and a medical review arranged.

Specialist TB nurses will be stationed at the centre.

'TB usually affects the lungs,' Dr Sheppeard said.

'Typically, it is spread through the air by coughing from people who have active tuberculosis. Fortunately, treatment for tuberculosis is highly effective.'

While the disease is common worldwide, it isn't in Australia, with only about 1200 cases diagnosed each year.
