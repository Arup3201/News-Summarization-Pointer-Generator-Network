Mourners gathered today for the funeral of the eighth Duke of Wellington, whose ancestor won the Battle of Waterloo.

Arthur Valerian Wellesley, who was also known as the Prince of Waterloo, died peacefully at his home in Hampshire, on December 31. He was aged 99.

A private funeral for relatives and family was held at Stratfield Saye Church near the family estate today. His coffin, draped in the Union Flag, was carried by soldiers from the Yorkshire Regiment - formerly The Duke of Wellington's Regiment.

The Duke's death came just four months before the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo in which the British army, under the command of the 1st Duke of Wellington, defeated Napoleon in what is is now Belgium.

Before his death, the 8th Duke spoke of the importance of marking the 200th anniversary of the victory.

'I am often asked whether we should not now, in these days of European unity, forget Waterloo and the battles of the past,' he said on the Waterloo 200 commemoration website.

'My reply is, history cannot be forgotten and we need to be reminded of the bravery of the thousands of men from many nations who fought and died in a few hours on June 18, 1815 and why their gallantry and sacrifice ensured peace in Europe for 50 years.'

Like his ancestor, the 8th Duke boasted an impressive military record, winning the Military Cross for his service during the Second World War.

Fighting with the Royal Horse Guards, he saw action in France and Belgium during the later stages of the war and also served in Cyprus in the early 1950s.

Later, he was transferred to the Household Cavalry, taking command of the regiment in 1959.

A year later, the Duke became colonel of the 22nd Armoured Brigade during its stint as a part of the British Army of the Rhine - the UK occupying force in Germany in the aftermath of World War Two.

After retiring from the army in 1968, he went on to work for tractor manufacturers Massey Ferguson and as Deputy Lieutenant of Hampshire.

Although he never saw active service in the military again, the 8th Duke retained close ties with the Armed Forces, serving as Deputy Colonel-in-Chief of the Yorkshire Regiment, Deputy Colonel of The Blues and Royals and an Honorary Colonel of the 2nd Battalion, Wessex Regiment.

His 69-year-old son Charles is now the 9th Duke of Wellington, while his grandson Arthur, 36, who is married to model Jemma Kidd, becomes heir to the Wellington title.

Speaking after the eighth Duke's death, Sir Anthony Seldon, headmaster of Wellington College, set up in honour of the 1st Duke of Wellington,  said he was 'one of the finest people I have known in my life'.

He said: 'He personified service, hard work, dignity and enthusiasm.

'Right until his final month, when I saw him with his daughter Lady Jane Wellesley at Stratfield Saye, he was full of zest and curiosity about everything that the young people were achieving at Wellington College, the school created in 1859 by Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and the Prime Minister Lord Derby, as the memorial to the first Duke, who had died in 1852.

'The whole Wellington College community is greatly saddened by this news. The Duke of Wellington, until the very end, was a regular visitor to the school.

'He was greatly looking forward to our celebrations in May and June of the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo. It has been the greatest privilege to have known him over the last 10 years since becoming Master of Wellington College.'

The death of the 8th Duke of Wellington marks the end of an era for one of the Britain's most eminent families.

Founded by Arthur Wellesey, the 1st Duke of Wellington, the dynasty rose to prominence following his stunning victory at Waterloo, where he led a combined force of British, Flemish and Prussian troops to glory against the French army of Napoleon Bonaparte. Already 1st Marquess of Wellington, he was made a duke in recognition of the extraordinary success.

The 1st Duke, who twice served as a Conservative prime minister, also established the family seat, the majestic Stratfield Saye in Hampshire, and cemented his outstanding reputation with 60 military victories and stints as Master of Horse for George IV and William IV.

Subsequent dukes have enjoyed glittering military careers, with the now deceased 8th Duke being awarded the Military Cross.

However, the new generation, Charles, the 9th Duke, and his son Arthur, have taken the family in a new direction. 

Charles has enjoyed a career in philanthropy and briefly dabbled in politics, but most intriguingly, married into the now defunct Prussian royal family.

His wife, Antonia, is the daughter of Prince Frederick of Prussia and a descendent of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, the man who plunged Europe into war in 1914.

Their son Arthur, one of five children, is a former equities trader who married model and socialite Jemma Kidd in 2005 and promptly moved her into the family home with his parents and grandparents.

The couple, who married in Barbados, now have three children, four-year-old twins Mae Madeleine and Arthur Darcey, and baby Alfred, who was born earlier this year. 

The death of the 8th Duke marks the end of an era in which the title holders distinguished themselves militarily.

The 2nd Duke, who was also called Arthur, held the position of Master of the Horse - a title that includes the management of the royal horses and hounds - under Queen Victoria.

When Arthur died childless, the title passed to a nephew, Henry. When he too died childless, the title passed to his brother Arthur, another military man who also sat in the House of Lords.

Arthur's descendants included another Arthur, the 5th Duke, who fought with the Grenadier Guards during the Boer War and World War I before becoming a Justice of the Peace.

Tragically, his son Henry, the 6th Duke, who was killed aged 31 during the Salerno Landings in 1943.

With Henry gone, the title passed to his uncle, Gerald, who founded the current branch of the family and was the father of Arthur Valerian who died today.

His son, who held the title of the 8th Prince of Waterloo along with several others, served, like his ill-fated cousin, in the British Army during the Second World War.

Fighting with the Royal Horse Guards, he saw action in France and Belgium during the later stages of the war and was awarded a military cross for his efforts.
